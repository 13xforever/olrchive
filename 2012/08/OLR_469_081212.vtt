00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Here's your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Tonight, August 12th, 2012, Amazon starts a new game studio

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Valve is set to use Steam for non-gaming applications

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
and has an R-rated version of a Super Nintendo game been discovered?

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
where every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
for this August the 12th of 2012 and the 400 and, wait for it

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
69th episode of our show

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
That doesn't imply anything by the way

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
No, not at all

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
to talk about video games, gaming culture, and so forth

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
with my co-host and those of you live and participating with us at VOG Network

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
but I'll get back to that in a minute

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
First, let me introduce my co-host

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
It implies that Rob has an internal 12 year old girl

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
What?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
That's giggling at the 69

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
You have a little girl inside of you? That's really weird

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, funny enough, I was playing Disneyland Connect Adventures today

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
which I didn't think we were going to get into gaming weeks as fast

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
but okay, why not, it's a special night

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
I found my inner little girl

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
because you can choose to be a boy or a girl

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
and I was like, well I'll be the little girl with pigtails

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
because she's cute

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
so maybe, Dark Sakura, maybe there is some truth to what you're saying

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Well I was just like, 69 tee hee

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, I know, when you say like 69

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
and start talking about girls, it is a little bit of a creeper zone

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
so we probably shouldn't go there, it's just a little creepy

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I like pie

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Pie is good

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Pie is good

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Pie is great, so is coffee

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Also over there, say hello to tech master Loki

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hi

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I'm doing fine

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
So what do you say?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
For old times sake, let's get Karaoke Revolution out

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
No

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
No one plays that anymore

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Okay, well I have SingStar

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
No one plays any karaoke games anymore

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
SingStar ABBA?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
No, I'm sorry, that's not acceptable

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh my god, SingStar ABBA, we totally need to do SingStar ABBA

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
I think we should do some live on air SingStar ABBA tonight

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
But I won't sing

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Would you like to maybe do a duet on SingStar ABBA later?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Maybe

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Maybe just for the listeners for the occasion?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Maybe

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
I don't wanna talk

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Come on, come on, you wanna do it, alright

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Say hello as well, we have some special guests in the studio tonight

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Please welcome back to the show, I'm always very happy to see him here in studio

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
And part of that is because he has a very sexy radio voice

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Say hello to Jason

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And I'm always glad to be back in California

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Welcome back, even in the triple degree heat?

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
Uh, it's no uh, 68 foggy San Francisco bay, but I still make the triple

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
It's 69 foggy Sacramento bay, excuse you

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Uh oh, right, right

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm gonna milk those jokes for all they're worth tonight

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Loki just gave me a look

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
God, I wish it was a- I mean, I don't wish it was a TV show, but like, I do sometimes

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I wish Loki had a camera, that's the only one that needs to be on cam, is Loki, let's be real

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't need to do that

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
That's the only one that people wanna see

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
His stealth webcam, considering the ones persistently pointed at his face

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
I do have a camera like, faced right at me, like the entire time

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
We need like the type of like, you remember like MTV back in the 90s where it was like audience cam

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Where they had music?

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Candy cam, yeah, back when they had music and like remote control and stuff

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
Like we need that zany audience cam, that's like, just like Blair Witch Project style shaking and all that

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
Japanese variety TV shows usually have one of the comedians or talents

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
They'll basically picture and picture the person right in the corner

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
So that when the news is interesting, shocking, whatever, you get that reaction cam right away

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Something like that would be perfect

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
I love that

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And they do it like all the time when I was watching Morning News with me

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright, we have another guest here in studio tonight

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
And I'm so happy to introduce this person to the show

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Because I know it's somebody who's been a long time listener of OLR

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
And she has finally made it to the studio after a 469 week pilgrimage

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
What can I say, she walked, no I'm kidding

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
But we're so happy to welcome, what am I calling you tonight?

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
You better introduce yourself because I don't want to call you the wrong thing tonight

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
Well I always went by Rai Chan and that's what I am on the chat, so hello

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Hello Rai Chan, welcome to the show

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I just call you Rai for short because I don't know, I heard Jason calling her that one

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
So I was like, I like that, Rai works for me

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
So Rai Chan, how are you?

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
It's good to finally be on vacation, it's good to finally be out here

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Yeah

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
Awesome, so how long have you been listening to Orange Launch Radio, it's been a while right?

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, I started about the time when Jason and I actually met

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
So it's been about 8 years or so

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
So you used to play, back in the day you used to play DDR and all that stuff?

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, that's how actually Jason and I met, so

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Okay, I want to hear the story, how did Jason and Rai meet over DDR?

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
The couple, the particular points that were interesting were

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Obviously her living in Colorado, myself living in New Mexico

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I being a mod for the Southwest part on DDR Freak

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
It all started because I told her she was breaking the rules

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
That was my first reason to explicitly

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Did you give her a point?

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Never, good choice of words

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Back to the story, did she

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
I didn't say did you give her a prick, I said did you give her a point?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
The DDR Freak rules were outside of the imaging forum

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
That pictures couldn't be more than 300x300

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And I used it as an excuse to private message her and say

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Well the rules say this, so could you please do that?

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
And she was very, well and how dare you, posted image over 300 kilobytes on a forum

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Shame on me

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
So we all kind of started, her and myself and a bunch of other people

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
Started getting on aimchat rooms just talking for all hours of the night

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Whatever random things

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
We were actually talking about this, we were over at Iguana Girls House

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
New place earlier this morning

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And I actually mentioned that both Rai and myself were on LiveJournal

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
And I saw her commenting on a post of Iguana Girls

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
And I found out that she was on LiveJournal as a result

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
So I started checking out her posts and commenting on them

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh my god, we're talking about DDR freakin' LiveJournal

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Tonight's show is like 10 years in the past

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
This episode of OLR was brought to you by a...

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Hey, I'm in a time warp tonight

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
We're out doing the take to late for NBC

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Alright

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
It's the OLR time capsule

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Bringing you live coverage tonight of the Sydney 2000 Olympics everybody

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
We actually recorded this show 10 years ago but no one even knows

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
We're just playing it back

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
Okay, so Rai, obviously, I mean we go back to the DDR days

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
But I know you're a gamer girl

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
What types of video games are you into? Or computer games or what have you?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Mostly RPGs, puzzle games

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Diablo

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Diablo

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Lots and lots of Diablo

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Lots of Diablo

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
I've got two level 60s and I'm working on a third

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Addict

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I play a lot of World of Warcraft

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
I play a lot of World of Warcraft

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
A lot of World of Warcraft

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
And every time I sign on

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
There's always at least one person on my real ID

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Can anyone guess who is always on real ID?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Signed in playing Diablo 3

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
That would be me

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Okay, so Diablo 3 has taken a lot of shit out there

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
But obviously you don't care because you're playing it

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
So why are haters hating on Diablo 3

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And why can they go just hate in the corner?

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
You know, with me, I started with Diablo 2 when I was in high school

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
It's one of those things that I have always really, really liked

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
So I waited for it to come out

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
People hate, people always hate

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Let them hate, I don't care

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Haters to the left

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Okay, we're just gonna play a little bit of word association

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
I'm gonna say a phrase, you tell me what comes to mind

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Alright, you ready?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Real money auction house

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Don't do it

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I've sold a couple things on there

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
But otherwise I don't really participate in it

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
PVP patch

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Not something that I care about

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
You know, you wanna go through and kill other players

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Go for it

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Activision

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
I just gotta laugh

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
And that's about it

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
Well said, well said

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, welcome to the show

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Rai, I'm sorry she's a little quiet you guys

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
She's actually, because we have five people tonight

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
She's actually having to share a mic with me

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
And the me mic

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Rob, don't shut up

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
That's right, I have a very loud voice

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
So the me mic is tuned for my voice

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
So when Rai talks in it, she's a little quiet

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
But I appreciate your prompt attention to Rai

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And the things she has to say

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Hey, we do tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Possibly read here on the show

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And some folks here in the chat room

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Let's see, BlackWolf is reminding us

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
That tonight's show has been tape delayed ten years

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Yes, Frisbee says

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Live from Salt Lake City

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Close, Jason might have gone through there

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
On the trip here, right?

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Uh, Provo and

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I-70 goes through both

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
The rail takes a destination that goes through Provo

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And has a stop in Salt Lake City

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
There you go

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
I want to talk about presents

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Because Loki was really awesome

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
And brought Dark Soccer and I presents

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And I guess they were like early Christmas

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Slash late birthday

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Whatever the reason was

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Those were awesome

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, I loved it

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
So tell the listeners about what that was

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Okay, so

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
After, and I really do blame VJHS

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
For this, after VJHS

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
After I kickstarted

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
That, or pledged to that

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Kickstarter, I started

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Getting into the habit of browsing Kickstarter

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
For things, and one of the things that I saw

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
There was a custom

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Card deck for

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
There's a bunch of companies doing custom cards

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
And stuff like that, so one of the decks

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
That was on there was

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
The Grid, it's like

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Tron themed cards, but not quite

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
You know, because they can't do it without the licensing

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
But it's

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Tron-esque cards, you know

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
That very neon black

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
They're pretty cool looking

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So it was a limited run

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I think they only did about a thousand of them

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And so I pledged to

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Get a bunch of, well, a few of the decks

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
So I kept one, I gave one to my friend

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I gave one to you guys

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, so, it was cool

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah, I gotta say, I don't even want to open them

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I'm like, I do need a deck of cards

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
For card games, but I don't want to open them

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Because they're so awesome

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
It's like, you know, not wanting to

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Open toys, just use them

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I can show you a picture of what all the cards look like

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
If that'll help

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Okay, that'll work

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Now, despite all the fact that we give Kickstarter a lot of

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Crap here on the show, you know, a lot of that's been me

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Although Jamie's had her fair share in giving Kickstarter

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Crap

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
And it's

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Again, it's not necessarily the whole website

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
That I have a problem with

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
There's just some people on there

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
You just have to be buyer beware

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Just like eBay

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Not all eBay auctions are evil, but some people

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Put up shady stuff

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
It's that thing that's being perpetuated as well

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Like, you want to make millions?

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Go to Kickstarter and just like

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
It's everybody's easy button answer right now

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
When things in life aren't that easy button

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
So it's like everybody's just swarming

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It's like the gold rush

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Everybody's just swarming on it

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You see, that's where most of my problems lie therein

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
There's been some good Kickstarters

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I have come this close

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
This close to donating

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
To one of the Kickstarters and I still might

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
And that would be my first Kickstarter ever

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
And that's the GamerCon one

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I'm seriously considering supporting

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Well, they've already hit their funding

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I was just on Kickstarter about a few seconds ago

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
And I saw that they had hit their funding, I think

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
For that, but that's still cool

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
They can always use more funding

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm kind of obligated

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
To go to GamerCon, you know

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It's in San Francisco, I mean

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
It's right up the street

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Yeah, but you can also go to YowieCon

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Which is also in San Francisco

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
YowieCon is fun

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
But GamerCon is about video games

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
YowieCon is about

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
YowieCon has electronic tools

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
No, it has the electric

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
469, folks

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
This guy was selling

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
These glass tubes

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
That attach to an electric current

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
And it shoots electricity across your skin

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And I had him turn it up all the way

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Because I have nerve damage in my hands

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
So I didn't feel it

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
And he's like, are you alive?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Yes, I want one of these

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It kind of tickles

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Alright, so Loki, Kickstarter

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You've kind of become a little bit like

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
You kickstart a lot of stuff

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
You have a lot of feet

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
A few things, I mean

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I don't know, I like independent projects

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Sometimes and I like stuff

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I like getting things in the mail

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I don't know

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
That's not

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
That's not why I do it

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I don't know why that's so funny

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
But because it's episode 469

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I like getting things in the mail

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
My mind goes to porn

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Dildos, lube

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I have never gotten porn, dildos, or lube

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
In the mail

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Yet

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I guess that does open up opportunities

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I have

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And I didn't even order it

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Get return present for Loki

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
One of these days

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
The UPS delivery man is going to be like

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Somebody just ordered you a 10 gallon bottle of lube

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Thanks

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
No, there's actually a website called

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
AlienDildos.com

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You're going to have to get one of the pumping mechanisms

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And I found it through

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
A mass effect forum

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Alright, anyways

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I back a few projects every now and then

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And actually I've done a few recently

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
But yeah, the second project I backed

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Was those cards

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Because they were pretty cool looking

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I was like, oh sweet, Tron cards

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Well this would be a great gift

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
That's exactly what I thought

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
I'm like, this would be a great gift

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
So I'm going to do that

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And so that's what I did

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I opened my cards and yeah, they're pretty awesome

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't play a lot of card games

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
But when I do, I'm going to use those

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I think you just became a gift

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Did you hear that? I don't play a lot of card games

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
But when I do

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
No, but

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You heard it too, right?

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
But when I do, I play them on the grid

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
No, but seriously

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
There's been some pretty cool projects on there

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
For example, Cards Against Humanity

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Was one I wish I had gotten

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
In on because that would have been awesome

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But they have that

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
I backed Ouya recently

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Which we'll see what happens with that

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
I'm pretty faithful that

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
It'll come through

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
I know a lot of people are like, oh

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
It's going to be like a phantom

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
It's going to disappear like a phantom

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Up in smoke

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Gone

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
But yeah, there's a lot of things that I back on there

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
That's where the cards came from

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
They actually have another set coming out too

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
This 4pm studios

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
They have a Cthulhu themed set

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
That looks pretty fucking sweet

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I'm really into what you're saying

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Usually I wouldn't go on these tangents

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
But thanks to the closing ceremonies

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
This will be our lowest rated live episode

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
In 4 years

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
What in the actual fuck

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Are you looking at on that computer dark

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Sakura?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's the funniest website

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
I've ever seen in my life

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
What is that? Rule 37?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
What do they call that?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
This is a Rule 37

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It's a website that I actually found

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Through a Mass Effect Tumblr

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Of course

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Well I have to say that this episode

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
The TTP has only been 26 minutes

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Wait a minute

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Tell us what the website is because I want to come back

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
To this whole discovery of the website

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
What is the website? I posted it in chat already

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Could you share for the podcast listeners?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
AlienDildos.com

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I don't know if we should be going down this path

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
There's already an explicit tag

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
There's no stopping this train

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Tell me in what part of Mass Effect

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Fandom

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Would we require

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
an AlienDildos.com

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
You're taking this femshep

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Garris thing a little too far

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
When you want to model

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Of his wiener as a butt plug

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
No

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Do not want

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Turian butt plug is taking this obsession one step too far

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
There's an FAQ

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
For a comic that someone was doing

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
And someone said

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
What do you think Turian cock

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Looks like?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And she linked to the site

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And the artist

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Linked to the site

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Who

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Who cares

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Rule 37

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And the internet cares

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
That's a true quote

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
If I've ever heard one

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
We usually

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Like to start the show by talking about our gaming

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Weeks and the type of video games that we've

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Been playing this week

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I just wanted to mention one thing since we were

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Previously before the Dildo Talk

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
We were talking about Kickstarter

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Which I would like to mention

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I asked him to call in too

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Maybe he'll call in later

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Speaking of Kickstarter

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
There is a Kickstarter

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That's being done by

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
One of our listeners

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
He is a part of his company

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And it's for a game called Evilot

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Evilot is kind of a

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Dungeon

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Defense game

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And they've got

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
A pretty low goal to hit

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
But of course they

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Need all the help that they can get

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
So if you guys can go maybe back

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
If it looks good

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
For $15 you get the game on every single platform

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
That they're releasing it on

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Did they pay for that commercial?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I'm just kidding

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I will support

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
A foodie monster

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
He's doing animation on

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
He hasn't listened in a while

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
What ever happened to him?

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Foodie monster, where are you?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Well foodie monster

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I want a Skype call in the coming weeks

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
If you're going to get your

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Kickstarter wares out there

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Evilot

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
They're about $3,500 of a $10,000 goal

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
That's not bad

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Still 3 weeks to go

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Still be relevant for that call within the next couple of episodes

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Good job

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I backed them

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
We're going to make a game for the Ouya

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
I need some games to play

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
On that console that may or may not disappear

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Into the mist like the Phantom

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Like the Phantom

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh a link

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Give a link in chat

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Alrighty

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Moving on, let's get into our gaming weeks

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
And the type of video games that we have been playing this week

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Dark Soccer, start us off

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
I'm playing Mass Effect 2 for Becky

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
And I'm playing Mass Effect 3 for me

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
And World of Warcraft

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
And

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I played

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Droplets on my phone

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
It's not as good on my phone as it is on

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Steam, just saying

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
So you went from Turian dildos to Orcish dildos

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
No

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Ew

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Everyone knows Orcs don't bathe

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
My bad

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Alright, Loki

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
How about your gaming week?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I actually played some different things

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Pretty much also the same stuff

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Played a lot more Minecraft

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Finally got to do some more co-op stuff

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
With my co-worker

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
It's still getting a little boring

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I actually just purchased it on PC

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Which I'm looking forward to playing around with the mods and stuff

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Because my PC probably can handle that

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Also

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Played a bit of Call of Duty

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Still fun

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Looking forward to the Black Ops 2

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
And then the new thing

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I actually played this week was Sleeping Dogs

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Which is a pretty awesome game

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
For those who are not aware

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It's what true crime Hong Kong

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Was

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It was going to be true crime Hong Kong

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Before the IP got sold off

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So now it's this brand new

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Open world action game

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
With a lot of kung fu

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
A lot of homages to classic kung fu

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Films and

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Crime dramas and all that

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
It has that feeling of

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
A Hong Kong action film which is pretty sweet

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
The combat in it

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Is pretty good

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Because it's a little bit more sophisticated

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Than Grand Theft Auto where

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Combat is just there as a side note

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Because it's mostly guns guns guns guns guns

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
This though

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Because it does have all that Hong Kong

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Influence

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
It's a lot of kung fu in there

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
So you're having to fight a ton of people

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
All at one time

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Having to do counters and stuff like that

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
For me the counter system doesn't

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Always work right

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Because they flash red

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And as long as you hit it while they're red

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
It should counter

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
But it doesn't work sometimes

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
It's a little annoying because I keep dying

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Over and over

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
But that's probably because it's not button masher friendly

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
But the game is really cool

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I know it's been getting a lot of coverage

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
In the blogs recently

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Definitely one to check out

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Especially if you're a fan of Grand Theft Auto type games

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
You're not getting a new Grand Theft Auto game

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Until at least next year

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Sometime

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Saints Row

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I do need to go back and play Saints Row though

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Um

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Did you just say fuck Saints Row and then I need to go play Saints Row

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Well I need to go finish my achievements

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
But yeah fuck that game because

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
They just

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Saints Row 2 was so great

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Those were two similarly different phrases

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
That you just used

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Rob wins

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And I can't say that they've fucking driven it into the ground

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Okay it

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You know

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Saints Row 2 was a great game

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
It was over the top

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
They had made it a little bit more over the top

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Than the first one

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And they expanded the features and stuff like that

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Saints Row the third looked like they were going to do even more with that

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
But then they just went fucking crazy with it

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
And it makes no god damn sense whatsoever

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
It's like

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
If you were

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Imagine if you will

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
With the Christopher Nolan

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
Batman's okay

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
And then all of a sudden the last movie is a fucking

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Joel Schumacher Batman

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
That's how the fucking series is gone with Saints Row

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
It's just like

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Okay that's kind of cool

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Okay that's even cooler

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
What the fuck happened?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Why are these things happening?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Why is there a sky fortress flying around?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You know

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
It's just really weird

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
You have to admit Saints Row the third is really funny

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
It's a fun game

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
But they hoard out the DLC

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
All the DLCs sucked

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
The game was Batman Returns

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Where it's like

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Okay it's a little different

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
A little zany, Jim Carrey is in it, he's funny

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
And then the DLC is just

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Batman and Robin

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
There they go, perfect example

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
And then look at what they were trying to do

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
They were like oh yeah we're going to do this

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Enter the dominatrix thing as a stand alone game

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Which right there

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I don't know about that

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
And then they were like hey you know what

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
We're going to take the milking of this property even further

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
We're just going to incorporate that into a

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
Brand new Saints Row the fourth game

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Or Saints Row the fourth

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Oh thank you

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
That's going to be fantastic that you're recycling this game

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
We actually have an exclusive clip

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
From some unreleased DLC

23:57.000 --> 24:15.000
For Saints Row the third, let's hear it

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Well that sounds like a pretty cool expansion

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
I'm going to tell you right now

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Okay if the next Batman game that came out

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Was based on

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Batman and Robin, I would actually probably buy it

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Because

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Batman and Robin should be a video game

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
As fucking terrible as that movie was

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
It's funny

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
No one is obviously taking this movie seriously

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
If you're casting Arnold Schwarzenegger

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
As Mr. Freeze

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
That's like

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Casting Tara Reid as a scientist

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Oh wait that's been done before too

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
But you know

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
That movie also sucked, Alone in the Dark

24:51.000 --> 24:55.000
What up G in our chat room says

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Bane was much better than that Bane

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
That's true

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
But I loved the voice they gave Bane

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
In the movie

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
He sounded like Count Chocula

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
He sounded Belgian

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Didn't Bane in the movie sound like

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Count Chocula to you?

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Let me remember him

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That's what he sounded like to me

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
He sounded like Count Chocula

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
And I couldn't take it

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
Because I'm like Count Chocula just

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Oh I shouldn't spoil

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
Alright

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Well that also wasn't a very good movie

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
Speaking of 13 year time warps

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Count Chocula is kind of an asshole

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Alright

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Anyway

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
Your gaming week

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Yes my gaming week if Loki is all done with his gaming week

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
I actually had quite a bit of a busy gaming week

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I have three games I want to talk about

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Let's talk first about Pit

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
I'm sorry

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Sorry sorry

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
There's one thing that is worth mentioning

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
The Ready Player One contest

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Oh yeah alright

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Fair enough I'm ready for an update

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
Alright so the Ready Player One contest

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Remember last week the whole thing I bitched about

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
You know fucking

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
You bitch!

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
At the break of world record

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
And it is basically impossible

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
To break the world record of

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
The four games that they started off with

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
At least it was impossible

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
For

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
You know Black Tiger

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
But I was willing

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
To buy Black Tiger

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
And make the adjustments

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
So that it was exactly

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Like the machine that had the world record

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
I was all ready to do that

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Right before I actually purchased anything

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I went and checked the update on the blog

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And sure enough someone had beat the world record

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
On Joust on 2600

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
And it has been confirmed

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
That was going to be the easiest one to beat

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
That was the only accessible one

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
That was the contest

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
Really

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
All that other stuff was just a red herring

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
But it was poorly run in the first place

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
You keep adding games

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
And changing the rules

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Within a couple days

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
It was ridiculous

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
But congratulations to the guy that won it

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Of course it still has to be confirmed by Twin Galaxies

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
But it's been confirmed by

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Whoever is running the contest I guess

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
It looks like it's legit

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Was it Joust that you guys were saying takes

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Like four days to meet the record?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
That's the arcade version

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
67 hours or something like that

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Okay so it certainly has been long enough

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
Since this news broke that they could have actually pulled it off

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
On the 2600 I think it was

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Different scoring

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
But yeah console versus arcade

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Alright

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Thank God too I was like

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Maybe I should check something before I make this purchase

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Because I was like okay I'm going to buy this

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
I'm going to buy

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
My pants laughing

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
If he comes to the show and just dumps

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
A black tiger motherboard on the table

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
God dammit

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Seriously let me put it this way

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Rob if I was to buy a black tiger

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Board I would be breaking the world record regardless

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Of you know

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
It's a thing I forgot

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Now it's a thing

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
You talked about this last week it's a thing

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Exactly alright anyways I'm done

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Are you sure you're done?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh Dark Soccer I thought of something else

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
No I'm very sad because Joe Kubert

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
What?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
Joe Kubert died

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
And who was he?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Uh born 1926

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Did a lot of DC stuff

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Well that means he lived a pretty full life though

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
26 that's

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I thought for a second there she was saying Joe Kubert

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
And I was like is that his first name?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
I kind of thought that's what she said at first too

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
But then I'm looking over her shoulder

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
At Tumblr and I'm like no

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And he did like a lot of Superman

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Well I mean sorry to hear he passed

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
We actually unfortunately have news about another passing

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
But we'll get to that a little later in the show

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Because I don't want to down the show too much

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
Because I want to talk about my gaming week

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And there's three games I want to talk about this week

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
First off on the iOS platforms

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
Pitfall which I guess is the 30th anniversary

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
Edition Pitfall or what have you

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
They really should just call this game

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Temple Run 2

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
Because that's exactly what this game is

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
It is Temple Run 2

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
The only connection

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
To the original 8-bit Atari 2600

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
Version of Pitfall

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
The little opening movie you see it for 5 seconds

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And then it transforms into

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
The new Pitfall

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
So wasn't there a marketplace

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
Or something like that out there that said

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
They were going to try to eliminate

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
Kind of these copycat games

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
Was that Android or something like that?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Well technically

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
You're not supposed to have them on iOS

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
But it's Atari

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
We're going to let them slide

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Activision in this case, even better

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
It's just enough different than Temple Run

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
That it's not really a copycat

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
I mean you still have the sliding

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
To turn around, you slide up to jump

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
You slide down to go over the tunnel

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
But now you tap the screen

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
To whip snakes that might be standing in your path

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Which the original Pitfall did have snakes

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
So they kind of figured out a way to

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Incorporate that

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Now I will say this, to the game's credit

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
The graphics are above and beyond

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
What Temple Run's got going on

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Not that Temple Run's a bad looking game

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
But you play it so much you kind of see the same thing over and over

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
The cool thing about Pitfall is that the

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Environments start to get varied

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Like you get to a certain length in the game

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
And now when you get to 2500 meters or whatever

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Now you start running through a cave

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
And it's like drastically different looking

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
And then I know in the box teaser

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
The teaser images that are out there

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
There's one that's like a minecart in a fire cavern type of thing

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
So that's kind of cool that they varied it a little bit

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
As well as when you start the game

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
It's kind of like from the side

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
And then like the camera rotates

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
To be behind you more like Temple Run

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Like the way the engine works

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
It seems like it's capable of more

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Graphically than Temple Run is

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
But um

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
If the graphics were that great

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
You shouldn't have frame skipping happen

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Especially in a game where

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
You know, precision is key

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And the frame skipping kind of screws it up

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
And here's the other thing about Pitfall

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
Like Temple Run, you have all these

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Mini transactions that you can do

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Within the game

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Pay 99 cents for a token

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And you can continue from where you left off

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Or pay 99 cents for diamonds

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
And you can dress Pitfall Harry up in a bear

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
Costume or a pirate

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Or a tooth fairy

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I kid you not, you can dress him up

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
It's just called fairy

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
You can dress him up as a fairy

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Can you do pretty princess or something?

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
I don't know because I'm not going to pay the money to do it

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Now I guess technically you can

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Grind the silver bars

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Which are basically the version of coins or whatever

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
But it always leaves a

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Bad taste in my mouth when you ask me

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
To pay for the game up front and then you

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
Try to shove these transactions down my throat

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
And I do not like

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
These constant pop-up messages

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
That are like, don't you want to spend money

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
To continue from this point?

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Don't you want to buy a costume? No!

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
I don't!

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
But he doesn't look like a fairy yet

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Don't you want to play as a fairy?

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I am hating

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Based on the fact that you have Grindr

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Installed on your iPhone, we think you might like

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
This costume

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But look, I don't like this whole

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
And I will never turn

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Push notifications on for these things

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Either

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
So that's the other thing

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
If I had those on, I'm sure I'd be getting messages

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
At two o'clock in the morning

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
Don't you want macaw tokens?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
We miss you, don't you want to play some more?

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
So I kind of hate

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
This whole free-to-play thing

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
Is just, I mean, I realize

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
It's not really free, it's still 99 cents to get the game

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
It's not free

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
It's still paying money for it

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Just wait until it goes free, if you even want to play it

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah, uh, Temple Run is free

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
It's pretty much the same game

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
But Pitfall has some varied environments, that's all

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
You gotta do it free so you can pay those microtransactions

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
I'm just, if I'm gonna pay the money

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
For those transactions, maybe we should do something

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
About the frame skip, can I pay 99 cents

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
To have a smooth running game? Thanks

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Alright, meanwhile

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
That's enough about that, other games I played this week

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
So for 20 bucks at Fry's

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
On sale or clearance or whatever

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
I got Connect Disneyland Adventures

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
Cause, you know, this game came out last holiday season

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
And it's Disneyland

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
And I consider myself a bit of a Disney affectionato

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
So I wanted to check this game out

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
And I played this game

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I played it for a good

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Hour or so

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
And this is where I really, truly realized

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
That I hate the fucking Connect

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I really

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
Like

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It really is the same mistake all over again

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
Like what we have with the eye toy

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
It's miserable to control

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
It is an absolute miserable experience to control this game

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
It's like, you have to hold your hand out

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
To turn

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
You have to put your hand out this way to go forward

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
And then

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Like, if I want to do a hug

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I'm supposed to reach out

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And try to hug

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
But then it'll think I'm dancing

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Instead and like all this stuff

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I'm just like, can't I just pick up the controller and play

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Like, I realize the name of the game

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
Is Connect Disneyland Adventures

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
But for a bunch of cute minigames

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
About a place I really love

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
You know what, I'll pay 20 bucks for the controller experience

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Can we just take the Connect part out?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
No

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
You can't disable the Connect in this game, unfortunately

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
I think that's too bad

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I really do think the killer app for Connect

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Is, uh, dancing games

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
And that's pretty much it

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
It's really the only thing that succeeds on that

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
And even then

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Dance Central and maybe Dance Paradise

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Although that game has it's issues

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Just Dance

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
Isn't bad either

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Anyway

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
So I don't know, like

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I also have to remember this game is made for kids

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
And here I am

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
30 and 100 years old and I'm playing the game

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
It doesn't matter though, I mean that's even worse

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
Because kids don't have patience at all

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
So if something's

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
Going wrong or it's not working they're just gonna

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Kick the TV or throw

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Throw the Connect through the window

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Frisbee in our chat

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Room at live.vognetwork.com says

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
You have to walk around Disneyland like a zombie

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
With your arms out, totally true

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
That is, you have to kinda like walk

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
You can't really do both hands out at the same time

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Because then the game doesn't understand if you're trying

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
To go left or right, but it's just silly

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Black Wolf

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
From the Bobby Black Wolf show

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
Which tapes before us at VOG Network says

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
The killer apps for Connect are all the

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Non-games like hospital apps

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
No, obviously those are killer apps for the

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
PC because the PC

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
The PC can handle the bandwidth

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
And they can basically, I think it's like double

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
The data you get from the Connect versus

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
The Xbox 360 which has to

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
Share the bus between all the USB ports

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
On the actual system so it's

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
Limited to what you can do

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
So yes, all the

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Hacks are, you know, where it's at

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But they're gonna try to sell you

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
On Connect 2, they're gonna say it's better than the last time

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
But

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Just like they told me it was better than the vision camera

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And that was better than the eye toy

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
It's like ehhhh

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Here's the tragic thing about Connect Disneyland

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
Adventures is that I actually

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
You know, despite the fact that the game is made for

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Kids, as somebody who really loves Disneyland

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I really did kinda like just walking

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
Around the virtual park, it's a pretty decent

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Recreation of the park, I mean you can't

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Go in every store or whatever, but

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I mean they have the frickin' corn dog cart

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Represented in the game

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
This way for corn dogs

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
And it's kinda fun to see the characters that are out there

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
And I like that they have the churro ride

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
They have churro carts

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
But you can't really do anything

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
There's lots of characters to find

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
They have a

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
World of Warcraft-esque, believe it or not

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Questing type thing

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Like you find Mickey and Mickey will be like

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Hello, find Goofy's autograph

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
It's interesting

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But it's ruined by the Connect

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
It needs the people movers and that'd be awesome

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Because in the world of

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Connect Disneyland Adventures, people aren't

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Dumb and can't fall off those things

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Or to have the gondolas again

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
It would be even better if you could have like archival

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Videos of Disney or Disney ride

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Videos or something that I know Disney would never

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Allow to be put in there, but I just think it

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Really enhanced the experience

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
Like, I think this idea should be

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Revisited without the Connect at some point

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
Seriously, I really

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Wanted to like this game

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
But I don't

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
And that makes me very sad

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
I definitely agree that the killer apps for the

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Connect are hospital apps

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Oh, I'm putting this scalpel forward

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Crap!

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
Thanks Bobby

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
That's the other thing that would be interesting

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Because you know how we always have these apps that are like

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
Okay, look, I got this game to work with Connect

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
I want to see the opposite, I want to see Connect games

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Working with a controller

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Okay, rdgsinge

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
In our chat room has a good comment too

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
The move of Eden was good, right?

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
No!

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
Not with Connect as the controller

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
With the controller it was great

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
The Connect thing was interesting to play once

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
Kamehameha!

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
Kamehameha!

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Yeah, but it wasn't super responsive

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
Apparently the PS3 version is pretty good with the move

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Because the move

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Sadly enough

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Isn't it tragic that the move actually ends up being a pretty good peripheral

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
With no one curve?

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
The move is actually a really good peripheral

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
It seriously is an excellent peripheral

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
And it works

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
But the thing is, no one fucking cares

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
It's like Sports Champions

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
It worked pretty much the entire time

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
Yeah, you had to calibrate it a couple times

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
But that was super quick

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And you still have to fucking calibrate shit in the Connect

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But on Connect you have Lady Gaga

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
So everybody's like

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
Oh, Connect!

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
Yep

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Anyhow, one more game I want to talk about tonight

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Sound Shapes

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Which is uh

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
Sorry, that's the spouse

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Did that go over the air?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
You just got an extra life?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Apparently for plugging Sound Shapes I got a 1up

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Oh, Dan is evil, my husband's evil

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
One of our yogurt places has Nutella frozen yogurt

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
That sounds great

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Now put your phone on vibrate

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Alright

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
469

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Alien dildo

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Alright, Sound Shapes

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
On the Vita and the PS3

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
Which I love that you buy it on one

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And you get it on both

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
How it should be

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
I didn't love that the cloud syncing isn't really working

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
Or at least it wasn't early in the week when I played it

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
But supposedly

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You're going to be able to have one save file across the two

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
But whatever, I was at least able to play the game

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Is it a music game?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Kinda

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
But it's not a music game where

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
A note is falling and you do something

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
When the note hits the line

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
That's the neat thing about it

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love those kinds of games

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Clearly, however

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
I'm ready for something kinda different

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
And the cool thing about Sound Shapes is, it's kinda different

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I think it's like a music game like Pot upon was a music game

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Not even that

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
It's just that the things that you collect

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
The music is all in the stage design

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
That's what it really boils down to

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
The stage design is where the music

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's not necessarily you

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Interacting with the music

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It's the environments interacting with the music

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Which is what's kinda cool

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
It's almost more Child of Eden and Res like

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
In that regard

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Since those games were brought up

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
I would say those would be a better comparison actually

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
But this is more like a Little Big Planet style game

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
And the game that this has the most in common with

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Not just Little Big Planet

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
It's Super Meat Boy

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
In a way

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Because it's that whole idea of

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
You can die very easy

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
But you just start from the last checkpoint

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
And try to get over these very difficult parts

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
Over and over and over again

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
There are stages in the game that are just

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Really cool

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Like the Beck stage

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
Beck has three stages

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
That first Beck stage is like the equivalent

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Of Shinen in Luminous

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
Like really

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
It's like the defining moment

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
When you're playing the game

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
Because the song kinda goes

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
It's going along and then the lyrics

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
One part of the lyrics goes

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Move a little

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Turn a little

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
And like while the lyrics are doing that

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
The little platforms

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
It moves a little

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
Then it turns a little

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Then it breaks apart a little

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
And then when it goes hurt a little

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
It turns red which is the bad thing color

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Which will kill you if you're still standing on it

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
And like when I was playing that I was like

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
That's so cool

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
And even Alan was watching over my shoulder

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And like just the little

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
He'll just sing this ahhh

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Thing in the background

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
That you can use that say ahhh

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
On them and just like playing that stage

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
Was just so cool

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Like it was neat

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
And that's how it kind of interacts with the music

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It's very much the environment

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Otherwise it's kind of a platformer

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
And it plays a lot like Meat Boy or Little Big Planet

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Obviously because of the online element

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Is a huge part of it too

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
All these stages you can get online

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That people have made

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
All their own levels and so forth

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Is that very Little Big Planet element

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Just like Little Big Planet

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
90% of them suck

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But it's kind of neat to see what people

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Come up with. I think the online mode

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
Could have been implemented a little better

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
It is early on

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
I think the interface doesn't work too well

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
For the online mode but

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
At least you can kind of track what your friends

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Are doing and that gives me hope that there's

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Something a little better

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
In there somewhere

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
But overall it's a game, shit it's a great deal

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
You get the game on two platforms

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
It's only 12 bucks

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
It's kind of limited

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
By the number of stages that are actually in the game

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I think there's about maybe

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
15 stages in the game

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
But it's only a $15 game

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And you do have the online stuff which is virtually unlimited

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
I think it's pretty good

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
I had a good time with it

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
So

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
This is sounding like Sound Shapes is a music game

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Like New Super Mario Brothers is a music game

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Lots of colorful interactivity

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Admittedly with Sound Shapes

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
More things are happening as a result

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
But with New Super Mario Brothers

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
One of the cutest parts of the game was the fact that

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
The backgrounds and everything else would

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
Have very distinctive cues

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
That go along with the music and then things like the Yoshi

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
That add the new rhythm and what not

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It was a really

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
It was one of the best aspects of that reboot

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Actually, yes, I didn't even think of that

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
But you're right

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
The music in New Super Mario Brothers

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Was really under appreciated

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Yeah, there is kind of an element to that with it

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
You know that goes all the way back to the original

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
Super Mario Brothers

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
I'm sorry, not the original, the original Super Mario

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
World on the Super Nintendo

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Because whenever you got Yoshi

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
You would have that little drum beat

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Oh yeah, that aspect of it, yeah

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
I'm thinking of like the normal

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
The hills will be dancing along the background

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Oh yeah, I love the way the little Koopas

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah, the way the little Koopas go

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
The little dance is so adorable

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
New Super Mario Brothers was a great game

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
And I can't wait for two

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Loki might have a word to say about that

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Alright

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Coming up on this episode of Orange Laundry

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Alright

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I was reading Kickstarter

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Not paying attention at all

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Again, alright, so I do recommend Sound Shapes

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
You don't even necessarily have to like music games

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Because it's not really a music game

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
It's a platformer that incorporates music elements

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
And I think that's a really good way

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
You know, it's that New Super Mario Brothers

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Wii cranked up to 11

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
In a way, so

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
That's a review I write for VOG Network later this week

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
So I'm gonna steal that

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
I need a few points for that, I think

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
VX JasonXV, contribute to this report

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I'll see what I can do, alright

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Moving on, speaking of Jason

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
I'll let you go next with your gaming week

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
What types of video games do you play this week?

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
Oh boy, most of my week was lost

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
By preparing for this trip

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
But I will say that when I was on the train

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
I was trying to play things that

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I didn't think would be particularly susceptible

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
To interference by the train

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Rocking back and forth, yeah I was wrong

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Limbo, Cave Story

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Braid, and other various

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Puzzle, platforming, adventure kind of things

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
I thought that I could

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Manage, but with as violent

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
As the train gets, especially in like Nevada

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
My hands were completely off the keyboard

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Flying all over the place

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Couple DS games

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
A friend of mine let me borrow

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Kid Icarus Uprising, and so

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Now my hands are completely cramped

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Because it's just, like the

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
Original DS that just doesn't fit

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
My hands just don't fit that system very well

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
I've been trying some of the alternative

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Control configurations, but then you

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Lose all precision and the game just

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Gets bad. I wonder if it's gonna feel better

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
On the XL that's coming out very soon

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
I've been considering hitting the Best Buy

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
To see if they have Kid Icarus

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
On demo and see if that alleviates

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
The problems, but I think that

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
I think the size

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Of the DS is wrong, but the bulk

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
The weight of the XL will be too much

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
And it'll just cause the same thing to happen

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I don't know

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
I finally got

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Starcraft working on my computer again

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Since Mountain Lion kind of broke a couple things

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
My Diablo's still busted, but my Starcraft 2

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Is working again, that's

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Pretty much the week in a nutshell

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Let me go over to Ryan, check in

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
How her gaming week was

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
It's okay, you don't play Diablo anyway

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
You're about to make up for it

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Yes, I've been playing a lot of

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Diablo, it's kind of my social hour

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
I also picked up

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Kingdom Hearts, the 3DS version

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I just barely started it

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Otherwise, just kind of

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
The find me and the

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Puzzle stuff, because I just picked up my 3DS

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
This last week

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Which is that amazingly awesome purple color

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I'm sorry, there's a part of me that wants to go sell

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Like, I'm having such a Shane moment

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I really hope he's listening

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Because I am having a total Shane moment

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Because the minute I saw that DS, I'm like

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm about ready to take my DS and sell it in

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
And get that purple one

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And the XL is on its way out

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
If I'm going to get a new 3DS

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
I need to get that one

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
That's the prettiest color handheld

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
I think I've ever seen

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
For real

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
It was one of those things that I told myself

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
If the purple one came stateside

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
That was going to be the one that I got

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Kind of held off for the color that I liked

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And of course, Kingdom Hearts came out the next week

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
So, yeah

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Good opportunity

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I know you haven't played a lot of Kingdom Hearts yet

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
But any early impressions

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
From what you have played?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
It's a lot to take in

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
In the very beginning

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I'm still struggling with all the new

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
All the new things that you can do with it

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
And by the way

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
I have a supporter in our chat room

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
JV Mon says the purple 3DS is beautiful

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
I'm right with you, Rob

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Thank you

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
At least it's not just me

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Kingdom Hearts

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Kingdom Hearts

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
I saw this hilarious thing floating around Facebook

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Which was literally a 40 page Google doc

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
To try and explain the plot

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
With pictures and arrows

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Is that the type of thing we have going on in the intro?

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Sort of

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
It has its own little tutorials

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
For each little thing

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
It's just so much to take in so quickly

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
It's

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
And this is a kids series

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
This is like a soap opera for kids

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
And adults

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
A lot of adults playing this game

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
I think the first one was kind of marketed at kids

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Probably, and it's Disney

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Who else would the target market be?

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
The official Disney parks continue

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
To ignore Kingdom Hearts

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Makes me so sad

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Anything else for your gaming week, Ry?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Not really

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Alright, well you throw something at me

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
If you want the mic to say something a little later

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
In the meantime, I'm going to plug

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Some things around the interwebs

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
To register participation

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
For this week's episode of

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Use the passphrase

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
As well as Twitter.com slash

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
OLRs where you can follow us

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
And of course, once again, please be sure

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
To visit our home station

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
The Voice of Geeks Network

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Vognetwork.com

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Lots of great programming throughout the week

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
On that website

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
If I'm able to get my work done tonight

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
We're going to have a little more music

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
And rotation. I'm adding a little bit more to the

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Music rotation for this week

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
For those folks that are actually listening

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And playing games

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
To the VoG network

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I posted something in the forums about how you can play

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Beat Hazard

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
You can actually use internet radio on Beat Hazard

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Well you can load VoG Network as one of the custom

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Stations and play Beat Hazard

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
To the music on VoG

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Or, if you're so daring, you can play to an

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Episode of Orange Lounge Radio or Pod Culture

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Or Girls Gone Wow or whatever

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
During the week. It's kind of fun

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
A little weird, but fun

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
News now that we're an hour into the show

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Loki. Sounds good. Alright

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
So let's talk a little bit about

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
What could possibly be the worst thing that

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Happened with gaming ever

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Windows 8

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
At least according to a lot of people

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
But, something else that they're adding

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
To some of the games that you may waste time

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
With in Windows

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
They're adding achievements

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
To the games you know

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
And love from back from

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Windows 3.1 I can get 20

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Points for beating Solitaire

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Yes Yes You can now get

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Achievements for Minesweeper, Solitaire, and

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Mahjong But if you

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Want more deck backs, you're gonna have to spend

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Microsoft Space Bucks

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
In order to unlock

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Watch. Fucking watch

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I'm

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Not upgrading

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Do you want mine hints for Minesweeper?

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Here's what I wanna know

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Do you want new faces that will explode

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
When you click on a mine? Where is that

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Go-kart game or that

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Was it the bumper card game

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
From XP? Why do

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I not see that listed there?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I forgot about that game, damn

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
That game is awesome

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
XP, that was 95 plus

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
What about that? And

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
While we're at it, you know, what about

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Didn't they have a bunch of Windows games like

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
There was Chips Challenge? Where's Chips

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Challenge? I want some more Chips Challenge

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
That was a fun game

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Maybe that will come in Windows 8

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Service Pack 1 But like, they also

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Had all those, like, was it the

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
All the different Solitaire games and Mahjong

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Games and stuff like that that came with that pack

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
It was just like, eh So how are you feeling

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
About Windows 8, Loki? Are you kind of in the

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
It stinks camp, but you're an achievement

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Whore? No, I'm not

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Not to that You used to be

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
I used to be, I'm a recovery achievement whore

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Well, admitting you have a

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Problem is the first step No, I honestly

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Windows 8 does not look

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Good at all to me

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
I mean, there's nothing so far that's told me that I need

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
It's gonna be for me, it's kind of like one of those

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Intermediate, you know

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Versions, like, I didn't jump on Vista

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
And I went to 7, so I'm thinking that

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Windows 9 or whatever the next one's gonna be

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
It'll probably be a little bit better for me

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Um, yeah, actually that's kind of the way it's been

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
You know, I've always skipped, you know

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
A generation, I didn't do

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I didn't do 95 to 98

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Skipped ME, went to XP

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Skipped Vista

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Went to 7, so, yeah, this'll be

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
This'll be the operating system I skip

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Windows 8

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Is interesting

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
That's kind of the reaction I have to it, but

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Interesting is also the word I use to describe

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
The commercial for Boo Boo Honey Child

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Whatever that show is on TLC

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
So, um, I don't know, take from that what you will

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
It would be cool, Windows 8

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Would be a better operating system

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
If touch screen monitors

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Were more mainstream

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Like, if my laptop

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Had a touch screen monitor on it

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Then yeah, Windows 8 would be pretty awesome

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Because you can do all the touch screen stuff, but

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I just don't think it's

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Necessary right now

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Alright, before we get to the next story, let's go to some comments

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
From our chat room at

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Vognetwork.com

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
DarkSakura, why didn't you say this in a microphone?

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
She says, I do believe

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
There is Kingdom Hearts stuff at Disney C

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
So, correcting what I said earlier

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
About why does Disney ignore the

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Kingdom Hearts

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Because this is America!

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
America! America!

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
We won the most gold, deal with it

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
And I really wasn't saying it in reply to you

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I was saying it to somebody in chat

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Yeah, Rob

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Let's see, and uh

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Excuse me, AlphaKnanogram is correcting me

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Whatever I said, it's Honey Boo Boo

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Here comes Honey Boo Boo, that's not my pad

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
I'm so sorry

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Porkchop says, who the fuck plays

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Minesweeper anymore?

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Um, you know

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
True story, I work in an adult

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Training environment, I teach

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
You know, adults in a corporate

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
World basically, like how to do their jobs

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And if we ever get people coming through the door

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
That aren't very comfortable

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
With using a computer, because sometimes you get

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Some like, retired folks

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
That want to take like, kind of a new job

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Or a new career

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
And they might not be as seasoned with computers

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Or whatever, we will actually assign them to go

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Home and play solitaire

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
To get better use with a mouse

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
And kind of get that coordination, it's a very

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Good way to

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
You know, kind of get used to that

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Whole hand-eye coordination, which

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Many of us take for granted, we all grew up

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
On that stuff, but for people that didn't

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Grow up on it and kind of have to learn it

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Solitaire is actually a great way to learn it

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Just, you know, think about it that way

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
And then when they come back and tell you, okay, I played

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Solitaire with my card deck, how's that supposed to

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Teach me computers, is this some sort of

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Crazy karate kid thing where I go

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Wax a car and I'm supposed to learn

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Kung-Fu, is that how it's gonna work?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
If I ever had a student say, it's a crazy

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Karate kid thing, I'd just give them

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
An A. Alright

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Let's be real

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Alright, uh, move

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
What else do I want to say, uh, oh

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Good chat, yes, thank you, the other comment

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
From GameGuru in our chatroom says

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
I see you are playing Solitaire

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Would you like special Clippy themed backs

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
For the game?

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Go to hell

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
This is an honest question because I don't know how to

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Do this, is there any way to turn off

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Beacons from other people, because

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Let's be honest, I have someone that's on my friends list

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Probably one of our listeners that has a beacon

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
That says, hey, I want friends to play

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Minecraft, cool

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
I know that already, I'm already playing

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Minecraft when I get your stupid notification

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Yeah, I never realized those things stay on like

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Forever, because I have- How do I turn that off?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
I think I had one set for like, Mass Effect 3

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Or something, I don't know, it's just like, everybody's like

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Gets a little beep

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I remember when I learned about how terrible

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
The notification system is, that I shut

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Mine off, in order to

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Not get them from your friends, I

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Don't think that's possible

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
De-friend them, maybe

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
No, don't do that

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Why don't you just send them a message that says, fuck you, you fucking

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Fuck, turn your beak off

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I'm already playing it, why don't you come play it?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
You wanna play apparently

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Alright, let's uh

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Move on with some more news

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And that would be me, talking about Amazon

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Game Studios

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Yeah, you know, Amazon, the website

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
That used to sell books

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
Sorry, I love Rageinator's comment

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
What was that? If Windows 8 is interesting, then by that definition

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
So is a lobotomy and colostomy bag

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
Fascinating

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Anyhow

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Also interesting, Amazon

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Game Studios

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Uh, yeah, Amazon of course, you know

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
They used to sell books and only books

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And now they sell books and

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Groceries

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
And probably sex toys

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
For all I know, probably Alien Dildos

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Probably has a shop front on Amazon.com

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I'm not sure, but

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
You can't buy vibrators on Amazon

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
For the listeners here

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I was looking up

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Vibrators on Amazon

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Think of an excuse, quick

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Mass Effect 3

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I was looking up Mass Effect

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
For the record, I know this because

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
When I was a massage therapist, I was looking up

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Electronic heat packs for necks

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
And it came to a list of personal

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Vibration assistants

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
You want happy ending?

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
No

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
No

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
No

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Yay, happy

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Alright, so Amazon

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
They've sold books, they've sold vibrators

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
And now they sell games

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
But I don't mean, like obviously Amazon sold games

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Already and even on the phones and so forth

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Now they're making them too, Amazon

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Game Studios

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
The first game that they have launched is

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Living Classics

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
I guess it's a hidden object game

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
But they're calling it a moving object game

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Alright, guess what, it's a Facebook

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Game

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Yeah, looks amazing, here's the trailer

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
We can look at for Living Classics here

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
The launch trailer

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Oh, you can find

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Moving objects

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Oh

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
That looks like a waste of time

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Perfect for Facebook

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
By the way, Amazon

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Is hiring and

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Alright, good luck with that Amazon

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Let's just hope you make some games that I want to play

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Out of curiosity, I went ahead and looked up

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Electronic heat packs

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
On Amazon

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
And they have the weirdest shit

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
There's no vibrators, but there's like screws

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
The Sims

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
NASCAR 2002

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
The Sims?

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
NASCAR Thunder 2002

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
How the fuck does that have anything to do with electronic heat packs?

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
There was some kind of bullet casing

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Or something in there too

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
And vibrating in it

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Whatever

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Let's move on with some more new Star Sakura

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I was looking at vibrating heating pads

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Oh, well there you go, vibrating

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
They're

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Really good to loosen up someone's neck

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Before you work on them

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Or loosen up someone's

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Never mind

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
469

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You're all children

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Yeah, speaking of ten years ago

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Well, how about

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Some Silent Hill news which has nothing to do with

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Vibrations and everything to do

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
With a dead nurse rape

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
Okay

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Well, it's true

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Red Pyramid

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Anyway

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
As we all know, Silent Hill

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
HD Collection is shit

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Because it was built from unfinished code

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
End of story

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Well, there's going to be a patch out that's only available on PS3

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
So, uh

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
People who got it on Xbox 360

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
You screwed, Konami don't care

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Boohoo, go cry a river

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Build a bridge and jump off it

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
What's that?

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
But I was reading something that

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
As long as you have your receipt, you're able to send it back to

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Konami and they will send you

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
A new version of the disc

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Okay, but Silent Hill HD Collection

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Came out in what, March?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Who still has their receipt?

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
You've got to be one of those anal retentive people

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
That actually went and bought a receipt scanner

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
So that way you can scan

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Your different receipts in here

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
So what if you buy it now

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
And then show them a receipt

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
And then you have them send you a free game on top of that

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
Well, let me read

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
From the official news source

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Facebook

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
And Konami's page

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Attention Silent Hill fans

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
If you purchase Silent Hill HD Collection

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
For the Xbox 360 new and from a

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Recognized retailer

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Oh, so that's how they're going to get around it

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
A recognized retailer

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Oh, we don't know about this GameStop shit

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
And still have the original receipt

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Please send the receipt to Konami

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Customer service for verification

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Further details, it's only valid for

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Silent Hill HD Collection

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Xbox 360 version games purchased

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
On or before August 8th

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
On or before August 8th, Loki

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
All requests must be made in

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Writing and submitted on or before

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
October 7th and it is subject to

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Availability

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Well they're screwed because no one knows how to write anymore

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Can't we just comment on the Facebook post

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
But it does say note the patch for Silent Hill

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Downpour for both Xbox

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
360 and Playstation 3

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Is currently in development

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And scheduled for a release at a later date

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
How about this, why didn't they just finish the damn

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Version

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
How about you just make it right the first time

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I'm glad I didn't buy it

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I still have Silent Hill 3 the good version

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
And that's all I care about

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
JVMON in chat says I keep all

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
My receipts, really?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Ragingator says I have receipts dating back

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
To 2002 and Stan says

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I keep my game receipts for some reason

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Wow, I'm just

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Actually, Dan and I used to save all of our receipts

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
For the electronics that we bought, we still have the receipt

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
For my Wacom

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I understand, for big huge purchases I get that

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Like when I bought my old TV

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
At Costco, hell yeah I kept the receipt

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Because Costco has an awesome return

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Policy

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Yeah, I mean they used to

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Knowing things like that, hell yeah

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I'll keep the receipt, but

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I don't really ever save them for games

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Maybe I ought to start

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Dan still has his box for his DS that has a post-it note on it

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
That says, this is Dan's DS, don't buy it

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I also love this

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
When we talk about recognized retailers

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Monty Boggs in our chat room

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
At live.vognetwork.com says

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Kmart? The fuck is Kmart denied?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Hey, I bought a Sonic shirt there

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
That's about it

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
I bought, I bought

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
A Super Mario Brothers shirt

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
There, I was very happy

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Jvmon in our chat says

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I still have the receipts for those Dunkin Donuts

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
K-Cups I got you, lol

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I drank one

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah, don't take this the wrong way

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Because the Dunkin Donuts K-Cups were great

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
But they're like half gone now

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So even if you had the receipt

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
The store's not gonna take them back

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I done drunk them

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And they were terrible

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Give me my money back

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
No, they were good, they were good

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
A little sugar, a little creamer

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Apparently you don't know how this works

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Grab coffee

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Alright, let's move on with some more news

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Hey, agreed porkchop

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Please don't fuck up the Zone of the Enders HD collection

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Cross his fingers

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Co-sign to that

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Exactly, it's like, oh hey, yeah, we don't wanna patch this

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But buy our new Zone of the Enders

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Oh, and by the way

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
We're still selling this

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
In case you do want a broken game

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
So anyways

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
There was some rumored

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Next-gen

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Kinect images

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Released on Twitter

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
By a guy that goes by the name

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
SuperDAE

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Who also apparently has no sense of humor

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Because I made a comment on his little post

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
And he said, don't be an idiot

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Bastard

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Don't be an idiot

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I just made the comment because you know

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
It's got the little neon character

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
The depth map on there

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
And it kind of resembles, you know

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
The image from Just Dance

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And I made the comment and I'm like

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Well, that's not an image from the new Kinect

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
That's just from the new version of Just Dance

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Apparently he has no sense of humor

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Because he didn't even say haha if I were funny

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
He said, don't be an idiot

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Well good, I'm not gonna be an idiot

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Like someone that would try to buy his

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Development kit for the Durango

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
That he just now put on eBay

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
That's up to $15,000

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And basically

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You're taking his word for it

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
That this is actually an Xbox Durango

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Development kit

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And it looks like a PC

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Because that's what the development kits look like

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And there's really nothing that guarantees you

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Anyway that

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
This is gonna be a development kit

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Other than the fact that I think some other developers

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Have a picture of it and they're like

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Yeah, that looks like a development kit

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
But who knows

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
But yes, so we'll see if this is legit or not

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Because if it is the real deal

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Then Microsoft will probably pull it off of eBay

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
But as of right now

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
It is

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Oh, it was ended early because the item was sold

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
For $20,000

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Well $20,000 was the last bid

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
But it says the listing was ended by the seller

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Because the item was sold

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Interesting, so like ended early or whatever?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yeah

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Surprised you could do that with bids on it

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Yeah, I didn't think you could do that, that's interesting

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Now the question is

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Who bought it, Gizmodo?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
We'll see

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Alright

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Meanwhile

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Be careful

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
If you are a Blizzard

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Or battle.net customer

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Oh yeah, that

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Because guess what, they got hacked

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
You know the old saying, hackers gonna hack

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
But to be fair, battle.net was

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Pretty upfront about what happened

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Because I think we've learned from history

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Don't try to hide this shit from your users

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
They're smarter than that

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
So Mike Morhaime, the CEO himself

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Wrote a little letter that says

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You know what, even when you are in the business

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Of fun, not every week ends up

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Being fun

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
And they found out that there was an unauthorized and illegal access

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Into the network at Blizzard

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
And they did confirm

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
No financial information such as credit cards

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Billing addresses or real names were compromised

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Thank God

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I was surprised they went this far

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
They said some data was illegally accessed

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Including a list of

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Email addresses for global battle.net

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Users outside of China

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
For players on North American servers

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Which generally includes players from

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And Southeast Asia

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So instead of saying it was everybody, they said

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
They targeted these specific regions

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
They got the answers to

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
The personal security questions

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And information relating to

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Mobile and dial-in authenticators

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
That's pretty bad that they got

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
The personal security question answers

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Because if you use those

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Security question and answers on other

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Sites

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
It's just like having a password anyway

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
It is

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
So that's pretty bad

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Now they do say

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Cryptographically scrambled versions

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Of battle.net passwords, not the actual

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Passwords were taken

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
But they do think with brute force

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
You could decode one at a time passwords

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But who cares if you've got the

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Answers to your secret questions

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You don't even need to do that

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So in the coming days they are going to prompt

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Folks to change the secret questions and answers

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Through an automated process

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Also the mobile authenticator users will have to

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Update the software and so on

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
So highly recommend at this point

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
If you play World of Warcraft

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
If you play Diablo

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
If you play Starcraft, any of those games

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
They're all on battle.net

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
You need to change your password

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
On battle.net right away and you can do that

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
At battle.net

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Slash account slash management

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Slash setting, you know what there's a link right there

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
At battle.net

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I had forgotten to do mine so I just did it

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
But can you, other than changing your passwords

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Because that's not going to matter if they have your secret questions

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Can you change your secret questions?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Not yet

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So then what the fuck's the point

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We have an authenticator

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I don't think the secret question alone

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Will get them into the account

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Especially if you've got an authenticator

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Attached to it

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I believe the secret question can only be used

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
To generate a reset request

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Which still goes to your email

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So this is the other important thing

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Your email password

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Needs to be unique

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
This is, I mean, in a perfect world

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Every password is unique

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
But I understand not everybody can realistically

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Do that with all the websites we sign up for

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
So your email password

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Needs to be unique

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
This is just internet security 101

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
If you do not have a unique

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Email password you are setting yourself

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Up for trouble because think about it

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Somebody gets your battle.net password here

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Or they got your Playstation password before

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Your Xbox password or whatever

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
They're going to use it to get in your email

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Once they get in your email, you're fucked

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Because all those reset requests

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Everything goes back to your email

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
The guy who got hacked through the whole

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
iCloud reset or whatever this week

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
For the record, when you do change your password

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
It also does send you an email

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
That says if you didn't make the change

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Click the link so that you can recover your account

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Well his hacking thing was a little different

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
That was just security flaws with whole social

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Networking and stuff like that

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Basically people

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Called up, added a fake credit card

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
To an Amazon account and then

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Called back up using that

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
New credit card as

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Authentication for other information

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Porkchop in our

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Chatroom says, anyone see that guy Francis

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Rage about the hacks on YouTube

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
No I didn't, but I love

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
I love internet rage

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
He tried to eat his authenticator

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Oh that's old

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
That was about

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Diablo 3

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
He did a new one

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Because he's a persona

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It's just a persona

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
It's all for hits

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
It's not as funny when it's fake

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
You know what's fucking hilarious is that

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Twilight girl

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
That's the stuff I live for

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
On YouTube

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Why would you cheat on him?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Why?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Really?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Oh yeah, Brittany

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Really? You've never seen

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The crying chick over Twilight?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
No because I have a life

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Tigerclaw, can you find me a link please?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I need to show Jamie this

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Please find me the crying

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
The girl who's losing her shit over Kristen Stewart

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I usually have better stuff

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You know the best thing is

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Oh she quit acting, when did she

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Start?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well Jamie if you wish

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
To take us back on track then by all means

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Give us another news story

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Sure as fuck ain't about no talent bitch

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
You know what

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I accidentally closed my story

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Oh yeah here we go

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
How about

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Diablo

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Um, it was funny

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I had a friend in Alabama who played a lot of Diablo

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Except with a thick southern accent

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
So it was Diablo

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Blow

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
So anyway

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Diablo

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Occasionally

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
La la la la la

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I don't need to know that

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Well

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
How about some

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Changes from Blizzard

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
There's gonna be a new patch

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
1.0.4

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
That will be out the fourth week

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Of August

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
They like co-op and they want more people to do it

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
So this is so that you can play more

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Co-op

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
They are

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Trying to make things a little bit more attractive

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
So they're gonna be removing the

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Averaging of magic find and gold

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Find in multiplayer

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
So that you will benefit from full magic find

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Independent of other players

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Okay wait

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I gotta go

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Let's let Jamie finish and then I'll go to Ry for reaction

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Well they added it in

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
They added the averaging in so that it didn't

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Involve people stacking adventure stats

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
To detriment the party

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
But I guess no one likes that

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I don't know I never did it

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Usually anytime someone joined my game I quit

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
The last

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Four times I played someone joined my game

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
I quit

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Alright let me go to the resident

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Real fan girl to check in on patch news

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
So that's why you said it

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
So that people have to ask

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I did

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
They still joined my game

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Really? Yes

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Of course this was before any patching had been done

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Gotcha

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
On the whole magic find gold find

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
My shit is my own

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I build up my gold find

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I build up my magic find

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
That shit is mine

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
It should not matter what yours is

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
If it's me

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Then it just makes it worse for me

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
So you know get out of my game

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Well

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
And this is why I'm still level 22

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
When she has 260's

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
There's more

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
But wait there's more

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Weapon damage is also

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Going to be retooled

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
So basically

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
It's

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'm just going to read the quote

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
That I like to make to our item

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Game addresses the difference between an item having

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
A chance of being good versus knowing

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
The item isn't going to be good before

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
You can even identify it

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
So they're basically

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Trying to

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Have a raw damage level between

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
61 and 62 weapons

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
So that it can

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Hit the top of 63 I think

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
However they explained it

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I have no idea because like I said I didn't play that much

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And then

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Enraged timers are being removed

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
From champion and rare monster packs

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
They will still be on bosses

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
But they will

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Not be

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Basically they don't want to have you have to do a

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
DPS check

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
What?

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Hey

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Ryaz do you know what that's getting at?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
No idea because all I know is enraged timers and wow

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So inferno is where

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
They brought in enraged timers

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
That if

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
You don't beat an enemy

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
A stack of enemies within a certain amount of time

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
You'll basically start taking like poison

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Damage you'll be standing there and your life

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Will just drain away

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
So instead of

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Trying to figure out

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Your strategy on how you're going to beat that group

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
If you take too long it's just

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Going to kill you

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Wow

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
That's stupid

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Another thing too is that

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Repair costs are going to be on high

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And items are going to be decreased by 25%

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
And

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
A bunch of other changes

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
That are going to come out later

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It's on the development blog

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Diablo 3 patch 1.04

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Seal of approval by Ry

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And sorry

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Still no PVP

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Maybe I'll play again

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It was free why not

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
I signed the blood pact

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
We're going to get into release dates

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
But before we do

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Let's do a culture lesson

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
On him and saying that she's sorry

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Like that makes it okay

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I feel like everybody needs to back off okay

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
This is none of your business

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
This is none of anybody's business

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But her releasing that statement

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It's like

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
It's like saying

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Hello world come on in

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
It's like saying it doesn't matter

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It's okay

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Oh I don't understand how she could do this

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Let me fast forward a little bit

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Because I want to see if there's

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
More breakdown

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I love him

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
I love him I'm so sorry okay

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
If you loved him that much

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
You wouldn't have done it

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
If you cared about him that much you wouldn't have done it

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And if you wanted people to back off

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And not be involved then you wouldn't have posted

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
That statement but

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
You see the thing is you were stupid enough

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
To get photographed doing it okay

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Don't be so stupid

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I can't help it

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
But that accent's awesome

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
There's like a level of sophistication

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I was going in between

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Going that's a pretty cool accent

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
And then going but she's so

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Stupid I want to point this out

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
She's very much

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
A fan of this person so I mean

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
But her accent is awesome

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
This is when fandom goes sour

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
This is 2.5 million

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Views on YouTube

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
And you just added to it Rob what the hell

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
And by the way bless you tiger

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
For finding this for us

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
I can always count on you 2.5 million

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Views on YouTube

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Do you know how many people listen to this show

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Far less

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But my favorite is

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
My favorite is the related

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Videos on the side such as

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Tom Cruise liked my nail polish

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Oh it's her too

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
She's been to McDonald's for breakfast

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
There's a stage at the top and there's going to be a band playing

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
But we don't know who

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I want to get to Tom Cruise

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Where is it

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Library day

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Ok Breaking Dawn Part 2 trailer

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Reaction I've seen this before it's so

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Amazing this video is like

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Where she's crying

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Through the whole thing

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
I don't think we know the truth

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Maybe we can convince the Volturi to listen

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
My family is in danger

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Oh my god

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh my god

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Oh my god

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
That was me watching the trailer for Mr. Pandaria

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Actually

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It can still be

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Anyone watching the trailer for Breaking Dawn

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Because it is that bad

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
We need to do one of those for showgirls

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And send it to Peaches

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Oh actually

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
The trailer just came out for the

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Mass Effect 3 Leviathan DLC

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
And we actually have

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Shane's reaction here on video

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Volturi

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
They're coming for us

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
We love you Shane

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
He's not in chat

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
I don't see him

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Is Shane there?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
He went on a work trip so he's in another

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
City right now and he's probably asleep

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Because he was up for like 27 hours straight

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
He said he was gonna try and listen on his phone

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Tonight but he's gotta be asleep

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Which is great because I've talked shit

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
About him like 3 times so far

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
In tonight's episode

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Well maybe we'll find out in about an hour

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
No I would've got a text message

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
By now

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I'm not that bad

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Just say jerk

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Alright

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Oh Shane

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Let's travel around the world and look at some

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Can I do reactions?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Yes

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
DarkSakra and Rob do reactions to the US release dates

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Here we go

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Coming out of Nintendo Wii the last story

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
I've been waiting for this game

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
This game

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Operation Rainbow

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
We did it

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
We did it

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
We did it

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
But I

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I love the Wii

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
I love you Wii

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I love Wii

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
I love Wii when nobody would love Wii

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Rob there there there there

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
You can love your Wii

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Alright

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
I was out there getting signatures

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Outside of Gamestop for Hyper Ace

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I love Darksiders 1

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
And then

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000

Let's travel to Japan

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Check out the Japanese release dates

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Maybe we'll get some reactions from Loki

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
If I can actually get the Japanese

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
I'm just building up the moment in anticipation here

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
If I can actually get the Japanese

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
I was just so excited about it

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I have to tell you about my fun Japanese moment

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Alright great

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
There was an exchange student in line behind me at Target

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Nevermind

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Actually this did happen the other day

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That was the worst story ever

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Congratulations

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Actually this did happen is that I helped her pick out a flavor of breath mints

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
True story

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Cool story bro

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And Rob

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
What?

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Alien Delo

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
On the Playstation 3 in Japan this week

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
From Hamster

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Is the group putting it out

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000

On the Playstation 3 in Japan

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Going to the 3DS

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Uwakoku Kansai-kan

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Airport Hero 3D Honolulu

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I don't know if that's kind of like the flight game

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Alien Dildos

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
No I don't think it's Alien Dildos actually

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And lastly taking a look at the Vita real quick

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Next Revolution

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Takenshiken comes out

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
As well as Tokushu Hudoubu

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Comes out this week

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Kind of a slower week in Japan

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Sorry to say

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But a game to get really excited about

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I know this is a game many of you at home

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Would be losing your shit over like the Twilight Girl

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Hatsune Miku Project

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Sadly she wasn't joking

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
That from Sega coming out on August 30th

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
What?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Alright

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
That's it for Japanese release dates

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Let's go to UK release dates

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
On the 13th of August we have Iron Brigade on the PC

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I was just trying to make it sound more authentic

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
15th of August

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
We have Dust

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
An Elysian Tall

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Is what it says

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
An Elysian Tall

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
God do you know what it says Tall?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I'm like what the crap

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
They need to fix their typefaces

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And on the 17th of August we have

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
New Super Mario Brothers 2

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
On the 3DS

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Now available at the retail in the U

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And that's it for the UK release dates?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Yeah

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Alright let's do a couple more news stories

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Cause we need something this week to keep the show classy

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Loki

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Alright so Valve discovered that one of the

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Custom made weapons

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
For

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Dota 2 which surprised me

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Cause I didn't realize Dota 2 was out already

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
But apparently it is

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And apparently someone copied

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
A mace that's from

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
The MMO Aeon

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Just so you know I don't think Dota 2 is officially out

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I mean Chatroom correct me if I'm wrong

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
I think it's just one of those betas like everybody's in

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Oh

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I think that's gonna work out

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Anyways so

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Apparently they discovered this

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
You know this

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Weapon in there and of course they removed

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
The item and issued a warning

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
To the players that

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
You know this kind of crap is not gonna be tolerated

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Not only did they do that they also

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Removed the maces from everybody's inventory

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
They replaced it with a new item

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And they also banned

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
The um

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
You know banned the person that made

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
The actual weapon

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
And stripped his account

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
From all the proceeds

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
From the sale so apparently there's real

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
There's real money transactions going along

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
With these weapons I think it's kind of like the hats

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And Team Fortress and all that stuff yeah

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And of course

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Reminding everybody that you know you must respect

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
IP of other companies and

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Encouraging their community to report

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Infringement this is how the fucking shit should

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Go down for anything on Apple's

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Marketplace when they discover hey

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
This is ripping off some shit they should well of course

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I think that's the whole problem is they don't know

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Burn it in ten thousand fires

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Basically you know they they don't have enough

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
People saying you know there's

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I guess not enough people looking at stuff

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
That's on their marketplace maybe that's the problem

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Because they do I know ban people when stuff's

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Discovered but

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And thank you chatters GameGuru confirming

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It's not out it's still in beta and

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Photoshop says it's been a beta for ages now

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
So basically it's like Gmail

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Like Gmail was in beta for what five years?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Alright

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Okay

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Alright it's just a new layer of beta

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Something else has been

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Sitting dormant for years and years

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
This is crazy oops

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
I didn't mean to like have that autoplay but there you go

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
The sounds you hear in the

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Background the sounds of the NBA

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Jam triple X

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Prototype is what they're calling it around the internet

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
That doesn't mean NGA

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
NGA

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
NBA Jam

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Acronym fail with boobies okay

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
That's not what they mean by triple X here but it's actually

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
The original cartridge got shipped

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
To this website NintendoPlayer.com

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Where they like to discover these prototypes

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
And whatever and this particular

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
You know

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Board got sent to them that was an

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
NBA Jam work in progress

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And it has Jam written over one little

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Chip there and then XXX over

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
The other chips so I don't think

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
It was like meant to like have that name triple

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
X but it's kind of funny that it does because

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Basically all it is it's the

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Same NBA Jam that was on the Super

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Nintendo but it has

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Some R rated outtakes

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
That are inserted in the game instead

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Here's an example this little YouTube

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
I'm going to play right here

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
He's cooking up

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Yes he just said he's

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Fucking up

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Get that shit out of here

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
No fucking way

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
He's on fucking fire

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
So lol the F word is all over

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
The game basically right

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Well some folks obviously are questioning

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Its authenticity including the guy

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Who did the original voice overs himself

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Who basically said oh wow

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
That's pretty crazy

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Somebody sounds just like me out there

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Doing these acts on the internet

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
But it appears this website

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Actually released they say

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Download right here you can actually download the ROM

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And try it for yourself so I don't think

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It's just the YouTube you can actually check this out

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
So they did dump the ROM and you can check this out

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And I don't know if you would just be able to

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Insert in your own clips or whatever

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I think you could ROM hack that

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And then you can burn the ROM chips

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Onto the cartridge

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
Yeah but I think it's also plausible you know

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
When you're in the sound booth doing recording

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And this was even said on some website somewhere

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Some forum post I got linked

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
And I apologize I don't have it in front of me

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
But it totally made sense

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
If you're doing voice overs for hours and hours

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Of these lines you're gonna do some funny ones

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
You're gonna have some zany outtakes

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
You're gonna have some moments of stress relief

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Where you just go how many times do you need me to say this

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
He's on fucking fire you know

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And then so yeah there's probably a programmer

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
That thought it would be funny

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
That thought it would be funny to put those in the game

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
But put it under lock and key so that nobody ever would get it

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Hot coffee

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Have you

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Lock and key but still in the game

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I remember a video that I saw

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
I don't know quite a couple years ago about

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Basically outtakes of Casey Kasem's top 50

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Or top 100 whatever he used to do

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
That he would be recording bombs for radio stations

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It's like the home of the best

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Radio in Illinois

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
And that's the cut of the take and then

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
How do I fucking know they're the best

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And similar similar similar situations

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Like that I mean

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I was able to for somebody to

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Have a similar voice plus effects sound the same

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Back to the future release

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
In the last two years

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Well there's also the outtake of

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Oh god I can't remember his name who was Elmer Fudd

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Or Porky Pig sorry

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
It said

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Son of a gun you thought I was gonna say son of a bitch didn't you

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And I'm really sure it's Christopher Walken

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Doing all those playthroughs of different games

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I'm really sure it's him you know

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Watching the playthroughs for that

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Or reading you know

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
What things are and all that stuff

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Bless you internet

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:29.000
We're up to our long distance dedication

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000
But he was most certainly a part of let's go start again

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
From coming out of the record

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Play the record okay

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Please

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
See when you come out of those up tempo god damn numbers man

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
It's impossible to make those transitions

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And then you gotta go into somebody dying

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
You know they do this to me all the time

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I don't know what the hell they do it for

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
But god damn it if we can't come out of a slow record

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I don't understand it

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Okay I want a god damn concerted effort to come out of a record

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
That isn't a fucking up tempo record

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Every time I do a god damn deaf dedication

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
We'll do it live

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Essentially so

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Those things can happen y'all

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
No I'm not saying this announcer guy lost it on Casey Kasem or Bill O'Reilly levels

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
But you know

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
His show would be even better if he did it that way

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Transformers

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
He was the voice of several transformers

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000
You're in a confined booth for god knows how many hours

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
You don't think moods start to change

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Go a little off script

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Anyhow I don't know I mean the fact that there actually is a ROM of it out there

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Makes it a lot more believable than just the video

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Granted a lot of work but why would somebody do that much work?

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Just to put the F word

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Especially in a website that's dedicated to this kind of crap anyways

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I don't think they'd go make something up

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Maybe if it was April 1st or something like that

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:17.000
It's like stock photo sites and how they're stock photo of the most absurd imaginable situations

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
What was the meme?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Naked in front of a refrigerator getting a salad or something completely ridiculous like that

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
What?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
You basically go for absurd stock photo pictures

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000
And the people that have to take these pictures come up with the most ridiculous scenes ever

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And so there is a whole series of censored naked people eating a salad

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Are you tossing the salad?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
No that's another site Rob

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Kotaku will run a...

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Kotaku will run anything

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I understand this but I'm just saying they run a feature every week

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It's about stock footage of people playing games

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And it's just like weird shit

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:07.000
There is the one where this emo chick is playing this game

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Laying off of a couch somehow

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And her friend has a hookah next to her

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And it's just like a non-lit hookah smoking it

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It's like why would you need stock footage for that?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Hipster gaming

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
You want to get high and play some sound shapes

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000
More like whatever sinks your battleship

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Let's go back to a time when games were so much simpler and pure

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Artist!

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
10 years ago right Rob?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Going back to the classic game of the week

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.000
A nice G-rated experience for everybody right DarkSakura?

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Who's going to dip into the vault right now and find a game that she thinks

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Hey you little shit I mean sucker

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
You should play this video game right now

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
If you're into shirtless bestiality you want this game

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And what game could you ever be talking about DarkSakura?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Altered Beast

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Which I really don't think I've ever done

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Rise from your grave

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
There we go we got to have it

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
In Japan it was called Juloki

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Which is Beast King's Chronicle

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Came out in 1988 by Sega

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
And it's a go around beat shit up game

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
It's set in ancient Greece

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And it's a centurion who is resurrected by Zeus

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
To rescue Athena

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Like Zeus ever cared about his kids

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And so he is able to turn into different beasts

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
When you get this little power up sphere thing

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.000
He just turns into big dude and then turns into animal man

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:51.000
It came out on several video game consoles and computers at home

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
It was a pack-in game for the Mega Drive

01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:00.000
And one of the designers for this was Makoto Uchida

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Who was the creator of Golden Axe

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So stylistically you can see things in between the two games

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
So anyway the centurion is dead

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
So basically you're playing a zombie

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000
And you have to beat some dude named Nef

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Well a demon god named Nef

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.000
And so you can become different types of aminals

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000
When you get to hell or Disks I should say

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
You face Nef who becomes a huge rhinoceros guy

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And then a blue bird comes out of the ground and turns into Athena

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
So it's very acid trippy too

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
It is side scrolling and it has been on damn near everything

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
So the orbs that you get through the game

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Will make you bigger and bad-asser with huge muscular thighs and abs

01:33:51.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And you turn into a werewolf, a weredragon, a werebear, a weretiger, or the golden werewolf

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.000
There's other different beasts in the Famicom version and in the Gameboy Advance version

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
And sometimes you get lightning power

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:21.000
At any rate you also have some very weird unicorn creatures in one of the levels

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
That just sort of tries to headbutt you to death

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
The dry queen unicorns, they were my favorite

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
The dry queen unicorns

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's like I would always laugh my ass off seeing them

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
So what it came out on is

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I hear giggles

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
It's just the chat room acting up

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Let's kneel

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Travis I'm gonna bench you over my knee and spank ya

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And not in the good way for the 69th episode

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.000
The fuck he said

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Nah it's not that, don't worry

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Get back to the classic game

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Alright

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:59.000
So it came out for the Sega Master System, the PC Engine, PC Engine CD, Famicom, Atari STX

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Spectrum, Commodore 64, R.O.B.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
The Armstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, and DOS

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:14.000
The Mega Drive slash Genesis version is important because it was a pack-in game for North America, Europe, and Brazil

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And then it was replaced by Sonic the Hedgehog

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
There is a handheld version of the game done by Tiger Electronics

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
God what is funny?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I'm not allowed to smile

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
But you're doing the nose laugh

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I'm laughing because Travis spoke up in chat and said, yeah baby

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And I tried to spank him so I'm laughing

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
Remember, it's only porn if you tape it

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000
So

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Yeah baby

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
The Mega Drive version is on several compilations

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Including the Sega Smash Pack, Sega Genesis Collection, and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
And on the latter two they are unlockable

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You can get it on the Virtual Console for Wii

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
It is on Xbox 360, on Xbox Live Arcade

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
And on the Playstation Network as the arcade version with HD support

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And has online

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000
What?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Sorry

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Online leaderboards and network play

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
There is an iOS version of the Mega Drive version

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
That came out in 2010 for the iPhone and iPad

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Because all the good stuff comes out on iOS and not Android

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:30.000
There are a lot of the lower versions

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
That only had single player and four levels

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And had different beasts like a human shark in the NES version

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It was very weird

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
But yeah, now there is this thing called Project Altered Beast

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
And this was a Playstation 2 title that came out

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Excuse me

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
In 2005 in Japan it was called Jewel Key Project Altered Beast

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And Altered Beast in Europe

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And it did not come out in North America

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
It was 18 plus rated in Japan for being intensity

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
But in Europe it was rated 12 plus

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
But it had like tons and tons of gore in it

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000
And it basically was kind of unrelated to the original game

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
You played as a dude called Luke Custer

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Who was a genome cyborg

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
And his DNA and genetic makeup was screwed

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
So that he could turn into a werewolf, a merman, a garuda

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Which basically is like an eagle

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
A wendigo, a minotaur and a dragon

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And then you could also be like a weretiger and a grizzly bear

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So bears in video games huh

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And then there was Altered Beast Guardian of the Realms

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Which was developed by 3D6 Games and published by THQ

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
That was a sequel for the GBA version

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.000
And you could turn into a werewolf, a snake man

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
A dragon, a tiger man, a spiked turtle

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
A shark man, a rhinoceros man

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
An eagle man

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
A scorpion or a chimera

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Or

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Yeah

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
So that's it

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Alright there it is, your classic game of the week

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.000
One last thing

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Altered Beast

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Neth, the bad guy

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Will be in rhinoceros form in Wreck it Ralph

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Oh okay

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
In the bad guy's anonymous scene

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Nice

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Alright Altered Beast, your classic game of the week

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Now some folks in chat are thinking

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Wasn't this a classic game of the week before?

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Actually it wasn't

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Here's where it came up on the show before

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Not that long ago the Genesis collection or whatever

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
The reimaginings that were on the Playstation Network and Xbox Live Arcade

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
They went free for Playstation Plus subscribers

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
That same week I signed up for Playstation Plus

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
So I went back and played through this entire game

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And I think I did this whole rant on those unicorns

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So I have talked about this game on the show previously

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
But it wasn't technically a classic game of the week

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
That was a little while ago at this point

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
So just to clear up any confusion

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
But I do remember when I played through it

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Can I check the list?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
It's pretty terrible

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Now keep in mind I had to play the Genesis version

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Not the arcade version

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
We actually just I think played through the Genesis version

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Not long ago

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
We had

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Pretty bad

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
No I take that back, Sega Ages

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
We played through

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Alright

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Alright so there it is your classic game of the week

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Altered Beast

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Let's take a break

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Obviously it's been a lullsy show so far

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
But the best is yet to come

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Nah I don't know I'm just saying that

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
But you don't know what's gonna happen on part B

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
We're gonna get to the emails

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
FUs of the week and phone calls

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Oh anything can happen during phone calls

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
All when we come back with more

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Episode number 469

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Already in progress

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.000
We've had quite the night so far

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Okay

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I have coffee

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I was talking to Alan in the other room during the break

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
And he's actually listening to the show while he plays Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Which by the way

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
He has a disgusting collection of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I saw the guns

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Pretty outstanding huh

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
He said he was about ready to come out here and tell us

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
No stop it stop it

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
During the uh

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
During the release date segment

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
But anyway we'll see what happens

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
In this part B of our program

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
The song was not about alien dildos

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Pork chop

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Now the podcasters will have no idea what you're talking about

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000
But during the break we played a song for Mass Effect

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
The long song that's the credits during the first game

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Unless you have DLC and then the song was seriously stopped

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
And you still have credits

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Right

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Actually that was me in Mass Effect 2

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
I had like another

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Same length of the song plus some

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Of no music

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
What?

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000
For Mass Effect 2 I had so much DLC

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Oh

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Because I bought the collector's edition

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Because it was 11 bucks and came with the first Mass Effect

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Which I already bought

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Right

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000
That I seriously had the length of the song

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Plus some of nothing

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
So I just went to the bathroom

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Cool story

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Alright

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Let's get into some rapid fire news

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And some quick stories about some things going on in the gaming world this week

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Logie

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Alright so Minecraft Pocket Edition has gotten an update

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Where they've added a few things that you can find in the full fledged version

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
On PC and Xbox 360

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Well 360 not being entirely full fledged

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
But you get the point

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Anyways

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
They've added skeletons and spiders

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
As well as bows

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
So now you can fire bows and arrows

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Or fire arrows at a

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Spiders and skeletons and bows oh my

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I'm surprised I thought they already had skeletons in the game

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
But maybe I'm just mistaken

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Maybe there's always zombies

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
I haven't played much of the Pocket Edition

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
But I do play it sometimes

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
When I'm stuck somewhere and I'll have my phone

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Skyrim is getting the 1.7 update on consoles

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Becoming out and of course it includes a number of bug fixes

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And optimizations and stuff like that

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
And they'll be coming out on Xbox

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
And also PC at some point

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Or PS3 at some point

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
And still no word on Dawnguard

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
For PS3

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You don't get it yet

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Because they're just not satisfied with

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000
When it's ready

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Exactly

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Well we're satisfied

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And then last but not least

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Cabela's

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:39.000
You know they're really trying hard to figure out a way to make Cabela's interesting

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
And so now the latest thing that they have

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Is they kind of modified their top shot gun

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Because they actually for the last few games

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
They've had this gun peripheral

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
It's a wireless gun that goes along with

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
The Xbox 360 and PS3 versions

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
But now they've retitled the gun the Fear Master

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And what makes it unique is that it has

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
A sensor built into the actual handle of the gun

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
That senses your heart rate

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000
And I guess based on that it will affect the game

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
So is that like the Wii Vitality sensor?

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Sort of

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Okay

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
But you know had they pitched it instead of saying

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
It'll make you healthy and blah blah blah

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
They could have made it you know

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
The Wii Vitality sensor

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
We're gonna throw dangerous animals at you

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I mean that might have been a little bit more interesting

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Like the Wii Vitality sensor had been for like Tokyo Jungle

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Which is a PlayStation game so I know that makes no sense

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
But you know

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Work with me here for a minute

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Yes

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Something like that

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
But that's coming out on the 23rd

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
That's Dangerous Hunts 2013

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Cause they have two

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Two Cabela's games that come out each year

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Actually last year they had three on the same day

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Why?

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh that also happened to be the week before

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 came out

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
So no one gave a shit

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Can I interject a little story about something like this?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Of course

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I actually hadn't heard of this before

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
And something kind of interesting that

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Not a lot of people know

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
May know as a result of the situation

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Fatal Frame 1 through 3 were all PlayStation 2 games

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And then Fatal Frame 4 came out on the Wii

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And actually incorporated motion controls

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Etcetera, etcetera

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000
In Japan and Europe they re-released Fatal Frame 2

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Under the Fatal Frame 4 controls

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
And it's amazing

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Like I wasn't a big fan of 4

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
First three games

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Absolutely love them

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
The relevance here is that Fatal Frame 2's re-release

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Has mini games

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
And they actually implemented something like this

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000
They attempted to

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Where you basically walk through a haunted house

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
In a Fatal Frame 2 scene

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And they basically measure fear

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
As a result of movement in the nunchuck and the Wiimote

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Obviously they're not going to be picking up your heart rate

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Or anything like that

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Which would have been a better indicator

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
But they'll throw sounds and ghosts and spirits

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And you know the Fatal Frame kind of situations at you

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And the goal is to keep the Wiimote and the nunchuck

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000
As steady as possible

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Now that would have been a pretty good use of the Wiimote

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Yeah, it's a nice little implementation

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
The re-release happened mid, late last year, earlier this year

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
I don't think it's going to come out in America

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
But the situation, the fact that they actually took something like that

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And went forward through it

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
It's kind of a cool application

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Because the Wiimote's going to know when you throw your hands up

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
And freak out

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
As, well, a little kid would anyways

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I haven't, I swear

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Ry, would you care to comment on that?

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Actually, he's pretty calm when playing those games

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
It's very fun to watch Jason play those

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Does Jason ever lose his shit over any video games?

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
That's a good question

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000
That is a really good question

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I don't think I've really seen him lose his shit

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I've seen him where he'll pause it

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
And kind of look away and that kind of thing

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
But nothing like getting up and screaming

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Or jumping from something that's bad

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Not like the boys at Four Player Podcast

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Yeah, not like one of our other friends

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
He's very, very scared of him

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.000
You can tell

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Has he played much of, was it

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Amnesia? Maybe that's the game we need to be adjacent to

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
No, well there's Amnesia and then there's also

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.000
What is it, not the

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Yeah, Ender

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Amnesia's on my list

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I do have it in Steam and it's on my list eventually

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Even when I played Silent Hill 3

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Slender, I'm sorry, not Ender

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
I've been confusing Minecraft again

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Well, it's Slender

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It's based on the Slender Man stuff

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
But they have Slender

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
People get fucking freaked out by that game

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
What is this on?

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
It's on PC

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
One of my coworkers was talking about it

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
And it's one of those things that I forgot the name of it

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So I couldn't come home and say

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Hey Jason, you need to play this

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So Slender and Amnesia, huh?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Slender is all about walking through the forest

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
And you get to find notes

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
But the Slender Man, you see, he stalks you

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And occasionally you'll walk into

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
And it's all at night with a flashlight

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
And if you look at him

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
You know, the longer you look at him

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
The more damage you take

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.000
And you're not supposed to look at the Slender Man

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I'm intrigued

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I will say that

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Just before Silent Hill HD Collections came out

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
I actually went there and replayed

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Went to go play through all of Silent Hill 1-4

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
The ambiance of 4 and especially the ending

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
It terrified me

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I could not get more than 15-20 minutes into Silent Hill 4

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
The quietness, the...

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
You didn't even start Silent Hill 4

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
It was the opening video

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
I took steps through the room

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I got to the point where the room started to transition

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Which was, okay, maybe it wasn't 20 minutes

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Maybe I'm giving myself a little bit too much credit there

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
I started the game

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I looked outside

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I saw the other apartment complex

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And the couple of people you could see moving

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000
But as soon as the wall started changing

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Plus the intro video

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Can you imagine?

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I can't wait for in the future

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
When we have these reaction videos

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
But instead of the reaction videos

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
People watching the screen

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
It's like a VR heads up display

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Or something like that

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Where you're just completely immersed

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And you turn around

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
HOLY SHIT!

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Immersion is going to be the best thing

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
And the worst thing for me

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
For the record, you know the only thing that creeps me out in Silent Hill?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
The rabbit

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
We need to get the video capture

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
For me it's that hospital room

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Where you go in the room and then all of a sudden it's the giant head

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
And it's like

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I can tell how scared you are right now

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Well I really think what we should do

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
We need to make it a priority to get the video capture set up in this place

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
So that for Halloween

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Or somewhere around there we can do a

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Scary game marathon

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
And make me play these scary games

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And I will cry

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I will throw things

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Nothing will match that experience

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Where I was playing Silent Hill Homecoming

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
And the ceiling falls down

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
In this one random part

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And I was playing in the middle of a rainstorm

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
And our front door blew open

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
And I swear to god

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
I jumped in my bed and went under the covers and started crying

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
I couldn't handle it

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
It was too much

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And Homecoming wasn't even that great

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
All things considered

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
It was alright

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Anyhow

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I have some news for you guys as well

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Unfortunately some sad news

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I have to start off with some sad news here

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
During my part of rapid fire news

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Paul Steed

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
He worked on bringing Wing Commander to 3D

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
He also was part of the original Xbox launch

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Unfortunately he passed away

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
We don't have a cause of death or what have you

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
But he was a very important part of 90s gaming

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
He worked on some big big PC titles in the 90s

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
Wing Commander

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Wings of Glory

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Bioforge

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Quake at ID Software

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And he also made the crack horror player model

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Yes that was a thing

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
So unfortunately he did pass away this week

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
According to the Jace Hall show

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Which there is a YouTube clip of him there

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
He leaves behind a wife and child

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Sorry to hear that

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Moving on

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
To news about the Wii U

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Wii games apparently going to be playable

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
On the Wii U gamepad

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
That's very interesting

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
We kind of expect that Nintendo platforms at this point

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Are going to be backwards compatible

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
With the prior platform

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
It's been a very common thing in the handheld part

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
And then of course we've seen

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
You know how the Wii will play GameCube games

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Well the Wii U will play the Wii games as well

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
And what's interesting is that you can actually play them

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
On the little gamepad

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Because those gamepads have the little sensor bar

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
In them

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
So yep you can point with the touch screen and so forth

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Using a Wii remote

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
However I want to point out

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
This is still apparently a rumor

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
That it's a Spanish brand manager

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And not an official Nintendo source

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
It kind of makes sense though

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
It would be a great reason to sell a mini-mote

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
A mini-mote

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
A little keychain mote

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
How big is this screen?

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Not even 4 inches or so?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Well it's not the size, Jason

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
It's how you use it

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
4-16

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I can't imagine playing a game

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
With that small of a pointing radius

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
No I understand

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Because even when they were showing

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
The Wii U

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
The Wii Fit U stuff

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
It was just like

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Ok that's fucking ridiculous

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
You're going to have this little thing set up

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
While your wife's watching TV

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And you're going to be exercising to this tiny little screen

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Come on, I mean that's a little

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Little dumb

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But there's other Wii games that would work

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Like Mario Galaxy

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
New Super Mario

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Virtual Console games

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
New Super Mario Brothers

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I was actually just thinking about that

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
That's kind of worse for one reason

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Certain power-ups

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
You're holding this

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
What I'm expecting to be rather

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Hefty tablet

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Less because it's not the whole guts

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
But you're holding this tablet in your hands

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Oh I need to throw a fireball

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Let me shake this ridiculously oversized

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Controller tablet

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
In order to spin jump

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Propeller

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
That thing had a built in projector

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
That little tablet thing had a built in projector

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
That would be fucking cool

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Wasn't that the early rumors about the revolution

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Was that it's going to project

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
3D out its anus

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Onto your wall

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Remember that shit?

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
No remember that was the console was the

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
VR headset

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
That's what the thing was

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
I remember the whole

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
The Wii is like fucking holograms and shit

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
I remember those were early

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
When it was the revolution and they said

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Oh it's the Wii

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
And you're like nope that's not going to be revolutionary at all

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Anyhow

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
We took this really kick ass name

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
And we cut its balls off

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Speaking of Nintendo news

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
There are some more details for Animal Crossing

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
3DS

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I don't know how I feel

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Total KK Total KK Total KK Total KK

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Animal Crossing was awesome the first time

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
It was one of the best games ever on the GameCube

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Back when it had the NES games unlocked

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
But now I don't know

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I'm getting a little bit

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I'm feeling a little burned out on this series

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
But I'll give it one more go with the 3DS version

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
It was educational for me

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Oh with the whole, you're talking about the

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Animal Forest with the Japanese letters

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Yeah because I was using it to practice reading

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Anyhow

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Here are some things to look forward to in the brand new

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Animal Crossing Jump Out

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Which by the way is the title

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Oh my god

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Well because it's 3D so the pictures they just

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Go out

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Yeah

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Loki these are the things you have to look forward to

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Because I know you're a big fan of Animal Crossing

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Oh I can't wait to pick it up for my 3

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Oh wait no I can't

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
An all new gardening store where you can purchase

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Plants

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Fantastic you know instead of having them at Nook's

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Where they've always been let's separate it into

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Yet another fucking store I gotta hike to

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
That has different hours in Nook

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Raccoon housing which will be run by Tom Nook

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
A wider variety

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Of fish and fossils which you can

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Donate to your museum

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
An exhibition room

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And shop in the museum which will be open

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
24 hours

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
I don't know of any museums that are open 24 hours

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Actually a lot of like

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
National parks and stuff like I'm thinking like

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Washington DC a lot of people don't know this but like the

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument they're all 24 hours

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Those are all outdoors I mean

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
A museum that you, ok sorry

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Rapid fire

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
When it's run by an owl

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
He can stay open all night

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
He's a night owl

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Touche

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
A miscellaneous goods store

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
That's what it's called

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
The Able Sisters Clothes Shop

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Oh wow that's a new feature

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Roofs, doors

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Posts and fences can be

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Customized

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
So I'm gonna have a pink

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Fence I can't wait till I have a lesbian

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Again I can't wait either

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Brand new furniture

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Including mermaid

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Items

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Under the sea

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
We need that little singing crab

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
A player will be the

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Mayor of his or her town

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
So now you're in control

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Oh but I like the mayor

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
He died

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Well he was pretty fucking old

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Can you evict citizens as the mayor

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
That would be awesome

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I would have an all lesbian

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Community

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
A thrift shop

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Will be available

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
It makes sense Goodwills are popping up

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
On every corner in this day and age

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
So it's basically

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
As opposed to like the recycle bin that you

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Free shit out of now you're gonna go buy it

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Alright a shopping mall

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Will be available

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And lastly

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
A shoe store

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Oh my god shit

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
All they're doing is fucking separating

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Everything out even more

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Than it was before

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
These aren't new features folks

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
These are just the same goddamn features

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Just spread out even more

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Between like each store instead of nooks carrying

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Pretty much everything it's just like

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Nooks is carrying

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
No I don't even know if there is a nooks in this game

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
But it's like a store carrying this type of item

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
This store is carrying this type of item

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
This store is carrying this type of item

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
This guy says you know

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
It's all fucking filler is all what it is

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Where's my store that sells classic NES games

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I'm not fucking there so that's why I'm not buying your damn game

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Oh I'm sorry that'd be the eShop I guess

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Yeah that would be the Nintendo store

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Wouldn't that be hilarious if there was a link

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Within Animal Crossing to the eShop

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
There's how you can integrate

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Some stuff in

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
That would be true innovation like the NES

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Carts are back oh but you have to buy them

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
As DLC now

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
People do that

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And you know I could see people doing that

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
But it'd be cool to have like

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Demo versus fuck that you know what

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
It's just still stupid because they don't have the classic games in there

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I would be scared for them to have demos for one reason

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Look at the demos that they had in Smash Brothers Brawl

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
I can play the

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Oh the first minute of the game

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Over and over

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Oh look at the progress I'm not making

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000
AcidicVampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
I was hoping for a shoes store

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
You know now that I think about it

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
I'll be able to make my character wear high heels

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I'm a lumberjack and I don't care

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I'm okay

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Sleep all night on a wiggle day

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Anyhow

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Dark Sakura let's move on with some rapid fire news

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Well how about something for a game that's been out for two years

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is getting new DLC

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Yes

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
On August 19th

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And it was

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
It's going to be on the two year anniversary

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Of the Xbox Live release

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
That's a long time to go by

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
It's going to be a $5 pack, 400 points

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
And it has a new character

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Wallace Wells

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
So you can be fantastic

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
And he doesn't actually need weapons

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:57.000
So I think he's just going to text people to death

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
And it will be on PSN by the way

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
This occasion calls for some

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Animanguchi

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Animanguchi I can never say their name

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Animanguchi

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I like the theme

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
The theme was great but Another Winter

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
The very first level stage

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Actually you know what one of my other songs on repeat is?

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Threshold

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:36.000
I love the picture

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
We've seen them live

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
It was fantastic

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
In other news

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Jet Set Radio

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Will be back for 9 bucks

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
It's going to be a PS3

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
And

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
The PS3 version will be

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Available for Playstation Plus users

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
On September 11th

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
And September 18th

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
The version will be out for everyone else

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Xbox Live Arcade and Steam versions will be out

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
On September 19th

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Also for 10 bucks

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Vita version will be out October 16th

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
It doesn't really say anything else about that

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
So

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I'll just hook up my Dreamcast

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
And play the good version that has Bjork in it

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And birthday cake

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Shut up and eat me

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Too bad no Bon Appetit

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
And then

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
They Bleed Pixels

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Which is the best name of the game ever

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
It's going to be out for Steam

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Instead of Xbox Live

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Indie games

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
So

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
That was the official word by

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
SpookySquidGames which is also a cool name

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Basically

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Their creative director said that

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
They want to reach a larger audience

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
And PC and Steam is just the place to do that

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
So go check it out

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
It's supposed to be really

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Freaking hard

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
And this says the more and better

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
You kill the faster you fill your checkpoint meter

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
I like killing

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
In games

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Alright is that it? That would be it sir

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
That's it for rapid fire news

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Let's get into the Fookal Question of the Week

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Thanks for having me

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Fookal

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Every week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
We like to ask a question and get your feedback

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
And you put Facebook and Google

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Together you get Fookal

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And it's just fun to say

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Fookal

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Alright our question this week

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Is

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Where the hell is it?

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Tonight

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I forgot how to navigate Google Plus

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I'm sorry

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Nobody left a comment on Google Plus tonight

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
There is officially nobody left on Google Plus

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Little tumbleweed rolls by

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Alright well here

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Let's assume people that use Google Plus

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Also watch the Olympics on a six hour

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Tape delay so

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Here's the question anyway

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Tonight we have a story on a game from the Super Nintendo days

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Where it was discovered this week that an unofficial

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Never released version of it contained some pretty

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Salty language which obviously was the

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
NBA Jam game we were talking about earlier

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
This had us thinking about

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Shocking moments in video games

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Have you ever been shocked by dialogue

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
In a game or something

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
That just happened in the plot

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I wasn't necessarily going to like F word shocking

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Just like were you ever like

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Oh my God

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
What about something that just made you say

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Oh no they just did not

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
What was a video game moment that had

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
You shocked

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
You spoonie bard

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Was that really a shocking moment for you?

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Considering I didn't play that game until it was released on the Playstation

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
That was more of a WT

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
I was like what's a spoonie bard

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I just thought it appropriate after I read the question

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Alright we have some great answers tonight on the Facebooks

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So I'm going to go through and read some of the answers here

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Picaruno says

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
You have to be pretty fucking filthy to shock me

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Although I think Brutal Legend handled the

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Swearing gore in a funny way

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Stopping the action just before an F bomb

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Or beheading to politely ask if you would like to enable

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
The fucks and guts

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Was that really what it was called? Fucks and guts?

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Ragenator says

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
I'd have to go with an unconventional choice

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
The Super Nintendo port of Mortal Kombat

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Ported by Acclaim

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
For what was included in the game, but for what was not

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Included in the game

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Meaning that the game was sanitized

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
This port has become the poster child of why games

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Shouldn't be censored

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And has given Nintendo a proverbial black eye

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
For a good many years

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
That was an interesting interpretation of the question

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Because he took it to mean I was so shocked in a bad way

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Like I was shocked at how shitty this turned out

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
That's kind of an interesting way to go with the question

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
They're punching the sweat off my face

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
That sweat is so shocking

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Let's see, moving on

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Stan says

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I just watched a battle scene for Persona 3

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
For the first time ever

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And my jaw seriously dropped when I saw that they had

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Summoned their Personas by shooting themselves

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
In the head

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I'm sure that that reason was explained in game

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
But WTF

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Ratchet Tag says

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Silent Hill 2

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I was playing through for the first time and there was a scene

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
In which you're walking down a hall and see Pyramid Head

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Doing really unspeakable things to mannequins

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I was a bit young so it was pretty shocking

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And disturbing

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
If you have played this you know what I'm talking about

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
He included a video with his answer

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
And I think we all know that scene in Silent Hill 2

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
And of course the preview kicks in

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And tells you exactly what the video is

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
In advance

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Which is both a helpful and hurtful thing

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Now Shane replied and also said something

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
From Silent Hill 2

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
I'll just put a spoiler warning out there

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Even though this game is almost 10 years old at this point

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
It's when you find out that James smothered

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
You with a pillow

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
That was ridiculous the first time you found out

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
It's a 10 year old game people

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Especially because they showed him doing it

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Runner up would be when Kaiden

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Got his head bashed in on Mars

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
In Mass Effect 3

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
I literally got up from my computer right after that happened

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
And walked around to try and lose

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
Some of my anger I was filled with

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
This brings us to a very interesting question

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
A Shane question that I would have to ask him someday

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
And that would be

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
What if

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Let's say that BioWare

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Never plans to make another Mass Effect game

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
But

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
They'll make a Mass Effect 4

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Only if Kaiden dies

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
In the first 5 minutes

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
For good

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Or Ashley depending on how you've played the games

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Then what do you do?

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Do you take another Mass Effect game

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Because hey more Mass Effect

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And have your favorite character die

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Or do you say you know what

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I choose to remember these games as they were

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Not dead

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
That's quite the dilemma isn't it

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
What would you do Dark Sakura

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Let's say Mass Effect 4 with Garrus dead

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
In the first 5 minutes or no more Mass Effect ever

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
What would you do?

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
No more Mass Effect ever

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Interesting alright

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Well I don't know because if they said it in another universe

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Totally then that's fine or in the future

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
It depends on the situation

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Alright

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Let's see

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Ospher says Soul Calibur 5

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
When Maxie beats Astaroth

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
He stares at the camera angrily and shouts

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
God damn freak

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
That's just rude

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Irene replied and said there's some obvious ones

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Chrono dying, Eris dying, Samus being a girl

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Justin Bailey, the upside down castle

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
That was like 7 answers

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
But one that kind of threw me off

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Was the revelation about the main antagonist

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Lady Mamiya

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
At the end of Sweet Home

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
No spoilers in case someone actually wanted to play through it

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
It just seemed intense

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
For an NES game

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
By the way I just got a text message

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
No more Mass Effect

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Thank you Shane

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
At least we know he's listening now

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Even though he missed the first half

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Shane, yes no more Mass Effect

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
Except I would cry if there was no

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Now if there was no cadence

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Sorry I wouldn't care

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Monty Boggs in our chat room says

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Ashley just tried to kill me so whatever let her die

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Well you can let Garrus shoot her

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Alright

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Mandrew replies and said

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
You don't know Jack

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
A buddy of mine and I were playing

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
And we had to type

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And we had to type an answer for a question

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
And he typed in fuck you

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Jack responded with fuck me

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
No fuck you

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
And deducted like 10,000 points or something

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
When you're in 6th grade that throws off your guard

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
That's awesome

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I never knew that could happen

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
But that's hilarious

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Extifer replied and said

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Hellscream called Sylvanas a bitch

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
In Warcraft

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
I'm sure there are several I'm not thinking of

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
But it all comes back to wow right

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
How about the dead babies in wow

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
You know what I'm talking about

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I think so yeah

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Where the troll lady is and she has all the babies

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
And then you have all the skeletons behind it

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
And the leather tents that the gnolls have

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
That are made out of peoples faces

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Clover Nikon replied

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
And said Silent Hill 2

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Which it was referred to earlier with Pyramid Head

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And the Amanakans

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Kareem J replied and said

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Gears of War 3 a certain character dies

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I won't say who but I thought it would be a character

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
They wouldn't kill off

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
How many games have we talked about tonight

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
That are upwards of 5 years old

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
And have danced around spoilers

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And now we're talking about Gears of War 3

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Well I think it's nice that people are trying to be respectful

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
I'm not going to criticize people for being respectful

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Of the spoilers

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Dark Charger replies and says

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Eternal Darkness

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Oh

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
That's a game they need to bring back on the Wii U

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
Don't they

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
That's a game that would

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
The problem with bringing a game like that

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Is now it has a standard

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
For what's going to be scary

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
And you can't do the same thing

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
You can't do the same things all over again

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Unless it's like literally a

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Graphically improved port

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
But people would be like this game isn't scary

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Oh

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
You can't redo a game like that

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It's not going to happen well until there's a

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Dramatic shift in technology

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Like immersion we were talking about before

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Until you can really have

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Something different to

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
To throw at the player again

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
It's not going to be interesting

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Oh wait let me get right on the mic here

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
But imagine the things that they did with

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Fatal Frame 4 and the remake of Fatal Frame 2

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Add that to the whole sanity

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Thing and all the things that they could do

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
To fuck with you with Eternal Darkness

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Yeah but the Haunted House and Fatal Frame 2

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
For people like us is stupid and boring

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Yeah but I'm sure that they could do some

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
And that's what I'm talking about

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
The bonuses and the extras and the things

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
That they would be throwing in nowadays

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Are dumb and boring

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
And Eternal Darkness as

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Kinda cheesy as the game was

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
The effects were really good

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And it made for a good way to keep you

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
To keep you through the game

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Alright let me finish the comment here from Dark Charger

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
If you went in there spoiler free

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Random noises, skewed perspectives

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
And even a blue screen of death made you question

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Your own sanity as you played through

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Chiggers replied and said

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
The first time I ever heard shit

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
In a game was when Barret said it in

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Final Fantasy 7, I was awestruck

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Uh actually

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Sit your ass down in that chair

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And drink your goddamn tea

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
And lastly Tigerclaw says

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
To me the most shocking moment in a video game

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Was in Bionic Commando

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
When you see Master D aka

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Hitler's head explode

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
That's pretty awesome

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I read all the answers cause they were all really good

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Thank you guys at facebook.com

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
What about you guys?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Shocking moments in video games

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I'm gonna go with a really cliche

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
One that was already mentioned but it really was the most

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Shocking moment for me was when Aris died

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
In Final Fantasy 7 like for real

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
For real I was like

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
That just fucking happened

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Really? Like they're gonna just off

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
A character, video game characters don't die

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
They just regenerate

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I cheered, I cheered

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
There's not really much that shocks me in a game

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I mean maybe

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Selly's throwing herself off a cliff

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I was like, did she just throw herself off a cliff?

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Stupid bitch

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Other than that

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I was like, oh

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
I haven't really had a shocking moment

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Um

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Oh I know one thing that actually

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Did kinda gross me out

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Well okay first of all Robbie the Rabbit

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Always kinda creeps me out

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
The big head in Silent Hill 4

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
And I knew the big head was there

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
But even seeing the big head was like

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Ugh stop looking at me

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Cause I have a thing about big heads

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And I don't like them

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Like we had

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Like the um

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
The clown face in Fun House

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
The pinball table

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
That thing creeps me out

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I mean it doesn't matter that

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
The goal is to hit it with a pinball

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
It's still creepy

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
And that's in pinball

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I'm gonna say a really recent one

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
The most shocking moment for me a recent game

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
That I actually played again this week for the first time in a while

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Journey on the Playstation 3

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Because I had no idea

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Going into it that it was a online

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Game and the moment I saw another person

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
There was kind of shocking like

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
What?

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
And the fact that they weren't acting like

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Jason saying go up here

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Go over here

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Journey

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Is such a fucking

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Great game like it's just

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I played through again

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
This week and it's just oh my god

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Like the way I'm like talking to people

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I was showing the game to Extifer and like

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I was like yeah and that's another person and then

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
The person was like trying to like

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Do the little singing to tell me

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
That there was a thing I was missing

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
In the little place where they were standing

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And it was just I don't

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
I don't know how to explain it it's such an experience

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
I still need to play that game

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
You really do Journey is an outstanding game

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
It damn well may be my game of the year I'm not sure yet

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Uh

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Do you have any shocking moments?

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Yes Loki shocking moments

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I don't actually I was trying to think of something but

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
No

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
I have two interpretations of them

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
One of them Ryan reminded me of

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
The one that I have in mind

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Literally shocking in terms of like

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
The frame one and two

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
To like an added effect

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Really did have a pretty profound impact on me

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
I've always been weird when it comes to ghosts

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And that kind of stuff and the whole

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
The lore and the situation

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
The sound the ambience that kind of stuff

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Those games really creeped me out for a very long time

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I could talk about this for hours but this is a

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Three oh wait four hour show

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
The example that Ryan reminded me of

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
That's actually really true

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Braid

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Braid was an amazing game

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Great platformer great everything

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I absolutely loved it it's one of the few titles

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
That I've actually 100% achieved

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
And in general just sat down

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And worked my way through with very

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Little to distract me in between

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Um but the story of it

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Is also ridiculously profound

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
And the very last level of Braid

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
After you do all you get all of the puzzle

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Pieces you put them all together and you

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Do the final like unraveling

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
In technically world one

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Um

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
How do I do this spoiler free

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Um it's just the best representation

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Of two sides of the story

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
That I've ever seen in gaming

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
And really in media in general

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
We have actdeft in our chatroom

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
At live.vognetwork.com says

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Braid sucks I hate the game haters to the left

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Alright

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Uh Ry

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
We'll end this with you any shocking moments

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Of course since I asked her

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Back channel if she had any suggestions

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I just took away her suggestion but that's okay

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I was the one playing it anyway

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Ha ha ha

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Um

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I mean I was happy that the fact

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
That Diablo 3 nothing got spoiled for me

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
So um things happening

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
In that one I was pretty surprised

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
With but

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Antishock

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
The Diablo

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Uh

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Whimsishire the Diablo

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Pinata there that's the word I'm looking for

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
My Diablo Pinata? What about it?

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Oh it was hilarious to me

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
When I was going through Whimsishire and I found

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
The big Diablo Pinata

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
It's even more awesome when I broke it and I got

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
The Horadric hamburger

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
The Horadric hamburger

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
This very

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Demonic you know undertone

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Dark game and then you have Whimsishire

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I mean that's classic Blizzard

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
It's beautiful but that was fun

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Alright we're gonna move on with some more

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
News for you guys and of course emails coming up

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
As well as phone calls

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Uh Loki

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
So there's already been hints that this was coming

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
But Valve has

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Finally made it known

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
That they're gonna be rolling out

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Other

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Non-game software on Steam

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Coming September 5th

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
And these will include other

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Include I guess Steamworks functionality

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Allowing automatic updating

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
And cloud storage

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
As well as other Steam features

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
And they have everything from like

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Construction to accounting, animation

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Design, illustration, photo editing

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Software training, web publishing

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
Etc

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
So lots of stuff

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Interesting and then of course

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I guess titles will continue to hit

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Steam after the initial

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
September 5th launch and they

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
I guess developers will be able to submit

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Their perspective

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Pieces of software via the

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Steam Greenlight program

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Did Steam just reinvent

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
The starter?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Um

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Maybe

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
It's not

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
To their credit it's not hey

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
I want the game so I'll

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Fund you this $5 but it's

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
More crowd sourcing the idea

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
In the first place

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
It has it's own potential but I'm sure in time

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
We'll see it's own demise, it's own draw

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Not it's own demise, it's own drawbacks

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Um

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Kind of brings more light to a comment that was made

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
A couple weeks ago when we talked about

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
There was something where um

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
And it always seemed like a weird comparison

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
But Gabe Newell from Valve

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Said something about yeah we were talking to

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Adobe and trying to convince them that

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Photoshop should be free and I think a lot

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Of us were like alright whatever they were talking

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And now we're like oh

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
That's why you would have had

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Valve talking to Adobe because they're trying

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
To get some of that software on this new

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Thing and they're trying to have the killer title

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
So that they're the additional

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Content of the store is actually

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Relevant to people

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
It's interesting do you think this could be successful?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Yeah definitely

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I do too

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
They should make the entire suite free

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And give it to me

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Looking forward to that Steam holiday sale

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Wait a minute didn't you say you didn't want Photoshop

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
To be free I seen you remember on that episode

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I just want it free for me

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Oh okay

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Not free for all

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Group of designers

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
That clears everything up thank you

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
And InDesign

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Well this won't be free

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
In fact it will be $109 if you

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Miss the Kickstarter

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
The oh yeah

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
The oh yeah

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
The oh yeah got funded and all that

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Good stuff boy did they get funded

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
$8.5 million

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
It was supposed to raise

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
$950,000 which was a pretty lofty

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Goal to begin with

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
$1 million in 8 hours

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
$8.5 million

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
After all was said and done when the Kickstarter closed

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
According to CEO

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Julie Urman of the oh yeah

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
We've been blown away the whole time

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
So there you go

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Also in news there

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
It's $109 like I said before

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
So it's a little bit more expensive

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Than the $99 during the Kickstarter

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
It's $119 if you

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Live in another place

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Not the US somewhere foreign

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
You get the little console

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
You can pre-order it now

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
They're saying now delivery is expected to commence

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
In April of 2013

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Is that because they're going to do the Kickstarter people in March?

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Yes Interesting

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
So they're not just subtly

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Rolling back the clock already

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
No they even said

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
To ensure that they can get the Kickstarter ones out first

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Interesting

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Also in oh yeah news

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Four controllers will be supported and

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Namco Bandai is in discussions

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
With the company

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
So I'm sure that just means oh hooray

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Another re-release of all those Namco classics

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Like Pac-Man

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I think they were talking about Soul Calibur

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
The Android

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Like how they have the

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Slightly toned down versions for

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Android and stuff

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Interesting

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Very interesting

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
And

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Hopefully

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Rich Racer

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Although

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I hope it's not Ridge Racer

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Like it was on the Vita

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Because that Ridge Racer sucked balls

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Ridge Racer

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
That would be great if that could be a

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Launch title

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
It does launch on every system

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
By the way I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
In our chat room

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Namco Bandai in discussions

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Indie game heaven

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Remember how this console was going to be the indie console

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
It's going to be as good for indie games

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
As the Xbox is

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Alright moving on

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Dark Sakura

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Well

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Star Trek Infinite Space, I'm sure people

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Saw all the ads all over Facebook for the beta

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
And everything, guess what?

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Canceled, not going to happen

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And they even, it was supposed to be set during

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Deep Space Nine and they even got like

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
A bunch of the cast

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
From Deep Space Nine to lend their talents

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
And nope they couldn't

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Get any funding

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
They couldn't find a publisher

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
So it's not happening

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Sad face

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
The demise of MMOs

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Has begun

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
No publisher for an MMO? How does that happen?

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
The fact that all Star Trek is right now is the Abrams movies

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I really wish there would be a new series

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Cry

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
As long as it's nothing like Enterprise

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
You know they have a

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Kickstarter right now that actually has

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Michael Dorn in it

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Oh really?

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
It's a freaking Kickstarter

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
It's a Star Trek documentary

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
With Star Trek actors

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Yeah

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Because there haven't already been

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
At least two

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Is Kickstarter Rule 35 now?

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
If it exists there's a Kickstarter for it?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Possibly actually

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
That's just what I got from

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
A couple of instances in this episode

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Alright a few more news stories

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
For you guys and then we're going to get to the mailbag

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
And before too long the Skype line at

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Or our username on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
But first

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Boy Rhode Island really put their money

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
In the wrong company

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
So 38 Studios

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
You know of course they kind of

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Tumbled and failed

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And yeah

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
So now Rhode Island owns

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
The rest of 38 Studios

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Including the assets, the rights to the single player

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Game that they put out

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
And of course their unfinished

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
MMO project

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
And now they're trying to sell off

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
These assets to recoup as much

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Of the loan as possible

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
And so maybe

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
That means that we'll see a new Kingdoms of Amalur

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Game

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Or whatever it's going to be called

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Because somebody will have to buy the rights inevitably

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
But it's going to go at bargain basement prices

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Which is kind of too bad

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Hey EA, you want another franchise?

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
The first game wasn't terrible

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I don't know

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Do you think that's what's going to happen?

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Do you think EA will snatch it up?

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Do you think anybody's going to be interested in this?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I think someone will snatch it up

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I'm not sure if it's going to be EA

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
It could be Ubisoft or something, who knows

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Well whenever that game comes out

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
One thing you could use to buy that game

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Because you know it'll cost 60 plus dollars

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Is trade in credit

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
In fact GameStop came out this week

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
And said that 70%

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Of trade credit is spent on

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
New games

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
That's totally hurting the games industry

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
With all those used game sales

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
To me this is kind of a duh

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
This comes from

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
GameStop president

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Paul Reines

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Talked to Gamasutra

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
And basically said this in an interview

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
That was about the total sales numbers

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
And the $11 billion and so forth

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
And basically was talking about

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Everybody always criticizes about used trade ins

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
But he said

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
We're really not cannibalizing new game sales

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
It's a common misconception

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
So my answer to developers is that we are driving growth

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
In a category that needs to grow

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
We think there's a real lack of awareness

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
As far as how trade ins are good for the industry

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
He may have a point in a way

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Because yeah, this is so obvious to me

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Because A, for one

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
GameStop gives you more money

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
For the games than they do for cash

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Right?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And they give you more money when you're pre-ordering

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
They'll give you bonuses when you're pre-ordering

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
As well and kind of like reinvesting

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Your money into the games that way

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Games are fucking expensive

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
$60 for a new game

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Is a lot of money

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Exactly, and also that money can go

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
To points, cards, whatever

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
To buy more DLC

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
So that's why I never understood

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
These people like, well we need to get rid of the used game market

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Yeah, go ahead and do that

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
And then you'll see your fucking numbers drop

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Because no one's buying your games

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Because one, they're fucking bitter at you for

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Getting rid of used game sales

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Or the campaign or DRM

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
That you're putting in place there

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
And B, they're not going to have the money to do it anymore

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
But my whole thing is

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I just prefer to cut out the middle man

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
And sell him on eBay

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Exactly

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
And use that money to buy whatever I want

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
A new video game or

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Maybe my shiny new iPad

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
I understand, and sometimes

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
It's a matter of convenience

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Sometimes you don't want to wait for that

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Or you don't want to go through the hassle to do that

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
And the opportunity costs

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
And you can either get X amount of money now

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Or you don't

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
And that's the thing about GameStop

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Is when you go in there

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
At least that should be the way

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
You go in there, you say, okay here's the games I have

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
What will you give me for them?

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
If that's not satisfactory to you, sell them on eBay

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
I mean, you can figure

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
You can call them up

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
I don't know if you can call them up

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
But you can go down there and say, here's what I have

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
If that's not enough money for you

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
What are your game values?

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Some games they do

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I don't think they do for all of them

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
And I'm sure it will vary based on

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
The condition your games are in

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
It's not like they're forcing you to

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Trade this stuff in

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Sorry, you already gave it to us

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
You can't have your games back

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
They're not going to do that

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Or even on top of that

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
You can take them to another game store

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Not GameStop that also does trades

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
And ask them, hey what will you give me for this?

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Figure out who's going to give you the best value

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Rama in our chat room says

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I don't trade in games

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
When I do, it'll never be GameStop

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Well certainly other companies are trying to copy

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
What's happened with GameStop's success

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
I think Best Buy did it

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I don't think they do it anymore

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
I think Amazon's still doing it though

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Because Amazon's got everything

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
We already learned that

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Best Buy still takes in trade-ins

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
The one that's close by us

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
They actually have a whole little station

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
With a counter set up

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
And somebody dedicated at that counter

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I was not aware

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I don't usually look into that here

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
And also too with GameStop now

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
What they're trying to do to get more people to trade in

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Stuff is they don't just sell games anymore

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
They sell electronics, phones

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
But the nice thing about Amazon

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Is that you can trade into games to Amazon

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
And then put that money towards a vibrating heating pad

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
As we learned about earlier in the show

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Or alien space still though

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000
If they have that, you know

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
You never know

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Gonna trade in new Super Mario Brothers Wii

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
And get some hot Turian cock

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Alright

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Mmmmmmm

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Don't make me make the noise, Rob

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Alright, let's

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I will make you make the noise

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Of opening the mail

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Oh, there you go, no more noise

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Not that

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
How's that? Alright

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Let's go to the mailbag

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Every week, DarkSakura opens the mailbag

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
And read some of her favorite emails

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
For you right now

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Sure

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Okay

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Um, this one's actually a contest

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
A contest

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
A contest?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
A giveaway

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
And wants me to do it via email like this

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
In the email

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
There's lots of giveaways

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
My gosh, I've got a code I've got to try and give away at some point

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
And we also still have to pick the winner

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
For when Brad packs stuff

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
No, it's not

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I saw that one in the mailbag earlier

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I will read it

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Hey, OLR crew, I apologize for intruding in your mailbag segment

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
But I would like to give away a PlayStation Network game code

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
To one of your live listeners in the U.S. Canada

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Of Puerto Rico

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
The code is for

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Dazimon Kids

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
An import PS1 classic side-scrolling shooter

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
The let's play

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I should keep it, never mind, no I'm kidding

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
So the let's players design their own levels

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Just to keep this contest simple

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I would like for the lovely DarkSakura

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Or equivalent sassy mail host

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
To say

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Hey

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
To say the code at the end of this email

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
And leave it to the first listener

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Who can claim the code to win

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Dazimon Kids can be played on a PS3, PSP

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Or in the near future, Vita

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
The code can be redeemed from the PlayStation Store

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
App on a console

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Or at account.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Good luck to everyone

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
This comes from the Nasty Canasta

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
I love that name

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
So are you ready?

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Get your pencils, get your keyboards ready

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Get a free game, here you go

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Picture pages, picture pages, time to get you

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Nobody gets picture pages?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Bite me

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:48.000
T-H-P-N

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000
P-L-N-P

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
T-M-N-3

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
There you go

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Not saying it again

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I want to know who wins it

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Alright, next email

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Yeah

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Um, this

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
I had to laugh, I had to laugh

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
There's a kickstarter to do Cheetamen 2

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
So that they're fixing it to make it playable

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
This is Konami Be Ashamed

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Oh, I'm not even gonna bother

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Okay

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
The subject of this one is Trainer

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Dear DarkSakura, which would offend you more?

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Me saying Samantha Trainer is a hotter piece of ass than Garos Vakarian

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Or

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
There's a link

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Says this

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
This being the song Windows Down by Big Time Rush

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
This song that samples Song 2 by Blur

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
And if by sample you mean rips off completely in ruins

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Ugh

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And that's Stay Black Entertainment

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Um

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Well given that I can't actually listen to it

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Because I have the sound off

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Um

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Well

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
If Damon Auburn sued the crap out of Big Time Rush

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Then that's okay

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
Um, Samantha Trainer is just annoying

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And everyone's entitled to their own opinion

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
I would say she's a hot piece of ass for what it's worth

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
The shower scene

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Like, I'm gay

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
And I still kind of get a semi on that shower scene

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
It's really hot

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
She wasn't even naked

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
What's up? Who showers in their bra?

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Motherfuck

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Moving on

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Cock teases

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Given that this is a lesbian shower scene

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Would it be a clit tease?

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
It'd be doubly hot because there's lesbians involved

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Yeah, but Shepard wasn't even naked

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Or in her undies

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
It's called, they didn't want the game to have an AO rating

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
So she had a bra on

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I think it should

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
It's like Showgirls on VH1

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Have you ever watched

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
I posted something on Tumblr a while back

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
And if someone can

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
If you can find it on my Tumblr, relink it

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
It's the romance scenes in Mass Effect 2

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Done with fly cam

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
So you can see all the little rendering cheats

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
That they did and like how Garrus' hand goes

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Like right through the middle of her chest and everything

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
And it's really funny

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Calima

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Yeah, I know

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Hey, OLR, I'm writing you from my phone

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
So please excuse my lack of form slash grammar

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Slash bad spelling

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Lack of bad spelling? Why would I complain?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Or anything else that relates to improper use of the English language

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
It looks like Rama says

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
He got it, by the way

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
That code earlier

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
And Black Wolf says, well sorry podcast listeners

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Guess you aren't a part of this

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Well, how about this

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
This is your code

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
And this is a code for

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Oh, I can't do it this way

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Because then somebody who's listening live

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Is gonna go to the podcast as soon as it comes out

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
And pull this code out of it

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
So I have to think of a way to give this code away

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I have a code for Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
That was generously donated by Pika Uno

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Email

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Random picked email

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Random picked email? Alright, fair enough

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Send an email

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
The 15th

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Alright, send an email

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
To mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
And tell us how jealous

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
You are

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
That the live listeners get all the good giveaways

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Tell us about your insane jealousy

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
And you may win Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
We will give it to

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
The

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
What, 15th person email

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Or whoever's the most fucked up

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
No, because you can't say that's too vague

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
You have to have a definitive answer

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
It's gonna be the 15th email

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
And if for whatever reason 15 people don't email us

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
We'll randomly draw one

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Then we'll randomly draw one

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
So there you go

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet on the Xbox 360

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Just for the podcast listeners

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
There's one they can participate in

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Can I finish reading this? Yes

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
I have two questions for you tonight

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
First, is there a way to stream the show

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
From an Android device

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
And if so, how does one go about setting that up?

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Well, first of all, you sell your phone and get an iPhone

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Stop, stop

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
To stream the show via an Android device

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Go to vognetwork.com

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
The good news is, the website's in HTML5

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
So you actually should be able to

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
And this works just for the record on iPhone as well

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
You should be able to go to the site

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
And just hit play

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
And it'll work

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
If for whatever reason that doesn't work

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
There is an app, and I know it's on iPhone

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
I'm pretty sure they wrote this for Android as well

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
It's called TuneIn

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
And that will allow you to listen live

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
If you've been here last night from the gym

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Yes, by the way, I joined a gym

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Which is a whole other story I'll have to get into at some point

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
But actually, listen to the conversation live

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
On TuneIn

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
So, I don't recall ever hearing anything

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
About how one goes to set this up

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
One email per person, you smartass listeners

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I will check your IP

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I don't recall ever hearing anything

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
About streaming since you switched to VoG

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Please provide any

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Okay, we already did all that

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Second, what do you believe to be the main cause of rhythm gaming

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
And we'll be seeing a return to the genre soon

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Well, anything that goes down has to come back up

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Some people attribute it to Guitar Hero oversaturating the market

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
While others point the finger at Rock Band

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
For their spamming of DLC

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Which separates friends who have more money

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
To spend on games than others

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Who don't necessarily have as much disposable income

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I've been playing Guitar Hero since the third one

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
And Rock Band since Rock Band 2

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
And I've watched the community decline steadily

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
And now it's a very small and tight-knit community

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
That's all fine and dandy

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Because you get closer with a regular group of friends

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
But now it's a sad state of affairs

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Because neither Guitar Hero nor Rock Band

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Have any games coming out

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I'm not counting Blitz because it's not a main series game

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
I have an answer

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Stubbornness killed the music game franchise

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Konami's unwillingness to support the franchise killed it

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
We went how many years without a DDR game

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
In the arcades

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
And one might say, oh well arcades were dying

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Or oh well it wasn't successful enough

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
So they would have made another bull to the shit

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Because the problem with that logic

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Is that you're pretending

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
That America didn't import

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
All of those games

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Like did you know you're not supposed to have

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
A Max 2 in America

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
That was never released

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Max never released

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Extreme never released

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
That's the problem

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
Konami of Japan did not believe in the franchise

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
And when they would make the games here

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Most of the time they were half-assed

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
When they were coming from Konami of Japan

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
There were two people

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Slash groups that believed

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
In Dance Dance Revolution

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
And the Bomani series in general at Konami

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
One of them was Jason Enos

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Without him you would have never had

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
These games in the first place

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
And what we did get in America

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
And on the Playstation releases and so forth

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
The other was Konami of Hawaii

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Which unfortunately their first release on the Xbox

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Wasn't

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I get the sense maybe

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
They didn't have as much freedom with that first game

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Because again the later Xbox games

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Ultramix 2 and Ultramix 3

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
That's the shit that should have been in the arcades

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Those would have been great

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
American DDR releases

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And we say this with our own

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Personal bias having been in the scene

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
As long as we have been but

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Isn't VR pretty

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Wildly

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Popular in the arcades with the

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Ones that actually have X and X2

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
I mean I'm not

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Out of the scene I have not been playing the game anymore

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
And if I'm gonna pick anything

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
I'm gonna go back to basically Extreme and Below

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
And a couple of gyms from afterwards

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
But let's not kid ourselves

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
Isn't DDR still doing pretty

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Damn good now that it actually has an American

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Song list? Well enough

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I think although the home releases seem

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
To have dried up I think actually

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Americanizing the song listed too much

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Is kind of because the whole point of DDR

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Was you take songs that are good

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
But people might

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Take you to new music

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Now I think the whole licensing with all the synth pop

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Stuff was pretty awesome

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
But I loved a lot of Dance Mania stuff

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Because it's like okay I recognize that song is kind of

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
A remix you know

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Oh this is kind of a neat take of this song

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Or this is a unique song I've never heard of from a Korean artist

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Or something like that or the song we played before

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
The show I was like dude that'd be a perfect DDR

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Song nowadays

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I would definitely tend to agree

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
That DDR

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Introducing me to Dance Mania is probably one of the best things

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Like my last decade of music

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Just lastly real quick I'm sorry

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
The last thing I want to say on this is that the other thing

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
That really screwed them

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
Guitar Hero was only a rampant success

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Because Konami was too stubborn to realize

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Those games would work here and they would have never paid

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
For the licensing and the case

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
I mean who made the first Guitar Hero

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Harmonics

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
But who did they team up with to get that done

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Who planted the seed

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Great Red Octane

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
What started Red Octane

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
What kind of company was Red Octane

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
DDR Pads and Guitar Freaks

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
Third Party Guitar Freak Controllers

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
And these mysterious Third Party Guitar Freaks Controllers

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
With five buttons

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
The Saga Red Octane for us is pretty sad

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
My Guitar Freaks Controllers were in the background

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
When we did the thing at my house

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
With the news

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And what happened when Rock Revolution came out

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
It was dismissed as a shitty ass Guitar Hero

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Clone and why

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
The song list sucked butthole

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Because it was a bunch of bad covers

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
And that was a very clear indication

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
That Konami of Japan was not willing

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
To put the investment or the risk

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
And in order to get rewards

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
You have to take a risk

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Konami of Japan was not willing to do that

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Therefore, Bimani died

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
To finish reading the email

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Go ahead

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
This will spiral out of control

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Because I have a few

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Agreements and disagreements

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Those of us who are still playing regularly

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
New instruments

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Because all of ours keep breaking over time

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Due to where we weren't able to find them

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Anywhere short of eBay for less than $100

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
For a damn guitar

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
Dimple

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
It's a used movie

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
And game and records and stuff

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I find guitars there all the time on the cheap

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
And usually in great condition

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
And all of mine are still in perfect shape

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Because you have to clean them out

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
And take good care of them

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
But other than that

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Thanks for answering, sorry for ranting

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Listen live at work tonight

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Brownie, that's it

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
The only thing I wanted to interject is that

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
As far as I know, Rock Revolution

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Was a mostly

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Japanese

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Developed, you know, license

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Acquisition was responsible

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
By the Japanese Konami

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Outfit

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
The music culture in Japan is

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Ridiculously different from America

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
And so for them to take that

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
Something original

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Put it on us

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Put it on the common American base

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
And be surprised at the failure

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
To me

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
From the limited amount of knowledge that I have

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
It already makes sense that I could just say

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Well, you're not making an American game

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
You're making a Japanese game and pushing it in America

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
And something as cultural as music

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
That's a pretty big deal

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Alright, anyway

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
We could spend more time talking about this

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
But we did already spend five years talking about it

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
So, was that it for emails?

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
If you want to send us an email

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
In the future

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I guess what's funny

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Because the live listeners are complaining that the stream went down

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Which is weird because I don't see the time out

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
That usually comes up when that happens

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
But I guess maybe a little hiccup

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I guess what happened, I said

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Bamani died, and as soon as I said died

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Is when the stream went down

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
It's almost like the watchful eye

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Of Konami Japan just fucking pulled the plug

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
On my internet when I said that

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
How dare you

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
But we know it's just because Comcast sucks

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
After the mailbag comes the FUs of the week

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
So let us get a little bit ranty

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
We usually start the FUs with Dark Sakura

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
But she ran out of the studio for a minute

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
So I'll start with the other lady

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
We'll let the other lady's first night

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Alright, do you have an FU of the week tonight?

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
I don't think I do right now

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
FU for being too nice

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I might think of something

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Alright, then how about Jason?

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
The other half

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
FU for getting a coat

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
And anything else at home

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Because it was ridiculously cold in the bay last night

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
It sucked to walk

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Fuck the bay

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Five degrees here and you're like

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
I need a jacket

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
And I think I had something else

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
But, eh

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Uh, Loki

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Uh, FU being burnt out at work

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Uh, my FU of the week

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Goes to my abs

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
And Extifer for showing me

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
That little ab machine

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Extifer convinced me to join a gym

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
There's a lot to be inspired about with Extifer

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Because Extifer used to be a big boy

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
And he lost

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
A lot of weight

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Through a pretty intense program at the gym

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Over the course of like a year

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
So I just, I don't know

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
I'm kind of at the point where I'm like, you know, I would like to lose a few pounds too

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Um, so

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I joined a gym

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
And he showed me how to use the little ab machine

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
And it really hurt the next day

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
These things are evil aren't they

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Also, FU'd that

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
It's not a Stairmaster

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
But it's like this escalator that never ends

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
That type of thing

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
That thing's a little fucker

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Alright, and

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
What gym are you going to?

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
24 hour

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Oh, I'm so sorry

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
I had a better experience there than the one you were recommending previously

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
But that's alright

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Different strokes for different folks

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Well, um, my FU

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
First of all, these tips are fucking delicious

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
But hot, but peppery

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
And, um

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
The car accident, my lower back for hurting

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
A bitch after my adjustment

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Um, and

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
The rental car that I have

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
I like that the stereo has the Bluetooth hookup

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
For the phone

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
But I miss my car and I don't like being

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Blown around like a leaf in the wind

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
On the freeway because it's so lightweight

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
I would rather

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
Have had a Corolla S than a baseline

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Corolla, I feel like I'm driving a mommy car

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Oh yeah, one more

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
FU'd a BurgerTime

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
For reminding me of how bad I suck

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
At classic arcade games

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And viewing angles

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Alright, Tigerclaw

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
In our chatroom asks a very good question

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
This is a very good question about the whole gym thing

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Tigerclaw says, Rob, when you went to the gym

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
When you went into the gym, it wasn't intimidating

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
And I have to admit, that's part of what held

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Me back for the longest time

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
The whole

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
Doing that in public type of thing

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
People looking at each other in the gym

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
I was a little weirded out

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
By that whole thing at first, which is why

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
For the longest time, I wouldn't go

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
But finally, it just

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Kind of hit me, like this whole thing

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
What am I going to see any of these

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Assholes outside the gym

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
I'm not going to see these people anywhere else

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Whatever, I'm just going to go and be in my

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Own little world and listen to my headphones

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
And if these people want to stare, then let them stare

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Because I'm hot

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
And that's pretty much where I ended up with

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Also, it really helped that when I went to the gym for the first time

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
I definitely saw people uglier than me

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
And that helped a lot actually

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
In a very superficial kind of way

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Right? Am I right, Jamie?

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
It's a relief to go in the gym and see people uglier than you, right?

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Sometimes

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
But the gym that I go to

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Actually has a lot of

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Track and ROT

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
ROTC people there

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
But they're doing the harder intensity stuff

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
And I'm like, I'm just going to walk over here

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Thank you. I do the rowing machine now, though

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Tigerclaw says

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Or nervous, because you walk in there and you see

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
A bunch of muscle-bound dudes working out

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
And they see a weakling walking to the gym

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
Hey!

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Why did you just call me?

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Um

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
No, I don't

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
But if the muscle-bound dudes are looking at me

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
And they're judging me

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Then they're checking me out

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
And that's their issue

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Sorry, I'm hot

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Well, you know what I would do

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Dan has a big thing for the circuit training

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
They have this big circle thing where they do circuit training

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
I go hang out in the dude section and lift weights

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Because

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
I have a weak ankle

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
And I can't really do much of that

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
So I just go lift weights with the dudes

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
And I get weird looks, but I don't care

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Fuck them!

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
There just comes a point in your life where you just

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I'm really not interested in them, thank you

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
There just comes a point in your life where you have to say

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Hi, haters! You know?

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
And just deal with it

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Deal with me

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Monty Boggs says

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
A new challenger approaches

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
I don't want to talk it up too much

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Because I just started

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Literally last week

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
And the last time I joined a gym

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I went once

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
So I never went again

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
But this time I'm hoping for better results

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
So I'll be more excited about this

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
If I'm still going in two months

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
I'll let you know how it goes

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Hopefully my abs will stop hurting

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Because that machine is evil

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
I already got a text message from Christopher today

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
So, did you go?

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
And I'm like, yes, I went on Saturday night

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Thank you very much

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
I'm a real winner, I go to the gym

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
On Saturday night, I didn't go to the club

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
I went to the gym

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
And then pizza on Sunday

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
And then I ate so much pizza on Sunday

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
But see, here's the thing, Jason

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
I would have eaten that pizza anyway

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
So

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Alright

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
There's usually a good diet to go along

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
With these kind of things, but eh

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Dark Tetsuya says instead of listening

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
To USL, no, I listen

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
I just said, the TuneIn app, I listen to the first

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Hour of USL from the gym

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
I know that Dark Sakura talked about the

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Rocky rehearsal, and I know that Travis talked

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
At length about the Mars landing

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
And how happy he was about that whole thing

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
And how he made the graphics during OLR

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Ha! Alright

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Anyhow

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Someone needs to take these chips away from me, they're freaking good

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Okay

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Yes

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Someone in chat was asking your chips

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
What brand and such they were

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I told them, but it's Trader Joe's rice and bean

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Chips with adzuki beans

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And they're very peppery

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Alright, let's do it, it's already past 9 o'clock

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
And we haven't even gotten to calls

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
So let's do these last few stories pretty quickly here

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
And I've got to do

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
I've got to do Twitter topics as well here

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
So, Loki

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
So, more Zinga news

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
Of course they're worried that people are

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Flocking away from the company

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
They're going to try to retain some of those employees

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
They're giving them free stock

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Free, worthless stock

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
Fantastic

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
There were some of those stories out there on one of those websites

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
I can't remember the name, but some of the stories from actual employees

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
And just about how the stock

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
That they were given to work those long hours

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Is just plummeted

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
It's actually kind of sad

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Because as much as I can't stand Zinga

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
And the games they put out

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
That's not a problem I have with

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
The line level employees

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
So to speak

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
The people that are actually doing the art

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
Or the programming

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
It's the way that company is managed

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
And the way they make some decisions

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
I bet there's some very talented people at Zinga

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
That would like to do something original

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
I know there's some talented people there

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Some of my friends work there

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
And they're very talented individuals and artists

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
But I can't see their talent being utilized

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
At all at this company

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Which is why I kind of feel bad

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Everyone talks about how evil they are

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Which is an evil company

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
It's not necessarily

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
It's not like those artists are evil

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Or the programmers are evil

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
It's just that the decisions are evil

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
So there you go

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Alright, is that it for that story?

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Wow that was quick

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
I said quick and you said you did it

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Alright then lastly I'll do this one real quick

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
This is an eBay, this was brought up earlier

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
An eBay auction that has a lot of people turning their heads

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
This is a guy who's basically selling his whole damn life

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
On eBay for 3.5 million

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
A 29 year old

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Who owns, which first off

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Props to him for establishing

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
3.5 million dollars worth of stuff

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
At age 29

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
I'm older than 29

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
And I'm not even worth a tenth of that

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
I think I saw

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
On a website the other day

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com is valued at about

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
$1500

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Yes

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
This guy made 3.5

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Or asking 3.5 million

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
I could ask $1000

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
And I'd have to split that three ways

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Really four

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Because it's Jason's site

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
And Deep Man designed it

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Five

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Anyhow

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
All kidding aside

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
This guy is selling on eBay

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
$3.5 million dollars

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
His entire

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Basically assets

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
His automobiles, the collectibles and so forth

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
He's the owner of R.U. Game

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
Which is an independent retailer

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
It's in Gainesville, Tampa

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
And Brandon, Florida

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
We have a couple listeners in Florida, I don't know if there's any in that area

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
But he owns these few stores

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
And I love the little

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Derpy Mario that's in the videos

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
There's like this guy in a Derp Derp Mario costume

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Whatever, anyway

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
He says he'll even hang around for six months to help the

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
New owner, he didn't really say why

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
He's doing it, it might have been in the video

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
But I wasn't going to watch the whole thing

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
It's because he wants to just start his next thing

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Or whatever that is

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
So it's like I want to start my life over

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
We are starting over

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Maybe he's Buddhist

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Maybe, who knows

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
But anyway, he's selling the whole thing off

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
No words yet if there are any serious bidders or whatever

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
But you know what, I say hats off to this guy

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Because a lot of people think it's fake

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
And it's just for publicity

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
And in which case I say, hats off to you dude

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Because you got covered on every game

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Blog this week with this little story

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
And you know this industry

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
They need to run something every day

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
On the websites

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
So this was like the best commercial you could ever

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Not buy

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
I tip my hat to you

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Doesn't RU Games

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Sound like it might be like a place to buy

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
Russian import games though

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Like when I first saw the name I kind of thought

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Oh, RU Games, it's like a Russian game store

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
I thought that that's

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
I didn't think of a stupid Facebook game

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
It's an industry that works with these types of stores

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
You would not believe how many

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Generic sounding game stores are out there

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
It's like, yeah

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
I'd like to make my game store

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
It's called

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
Well, I'm trying to remember

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
It's like

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
It's something like GameStop

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
But it wasn't GameStop, it was very close

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Game yield

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Game go, go game

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
No, it was like

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Go GameStop

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Something like that

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Why are you naming?

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Go GameStop, that's kind of

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Video game center

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Game store

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
The game place

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
I named the game store the Danone, did you know that?

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Oh really? Game on

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
That ended up being a show, right?

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Well this was years ago

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Game shop

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
I've seen that

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
There's game trader that uses the same

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Text and colors

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
Answered the question

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Yes, I am game, are you movie?

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Laughs

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
I'm sorry

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
I found that response to be hilarious

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Like I just want to walk

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Into the store, why yes I am game

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Are you movie? Well here's the thing too

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
He's even admitted, even if it doesn't sell

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Or he doesn't get a

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Buyer for it, it's great advertising for my

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Store, because he got all these

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Blogs talking about this store

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
So he could

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Props to you and your derpy ass Mario

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Mascot guy

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Laughs

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
You know Nintendo might see that

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
And get a little upset

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Just saying

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
I'll see derpy Mario fight

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Mario Mascot

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Laughs

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Maybe in the next Smash Brothers

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Dr. Mario vs.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Derpy Mario

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Laughs

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Laughs

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Laughs

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Oh my god mushrooms, oh my god

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Mr. Derpy Mario

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Oh my god mushrooms

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
If that doesn't just epitomize this episode

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Oh my god first floor

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Oh my god Zelda chic

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Laughs

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Sigh

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Orange lounge derpio according to the chatroom

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Thank you, thank you guys

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Alright let's go to the skype

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Line, we're gonna open it up now

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
1877 game olr

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Or our username on skype is orange

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Lounge radio, we can't wait to take your

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Call, in the mean time

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
We'll do some last minute stories

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
I'll do a couple of these quick tweets here

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Let's see

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Gamer girl was responding a little late to the

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Facebook question on Twitter

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
I think she's being ironic

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
First game that ever shocked me was God

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
of War when you go into the ships cabin

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
And you get to do the girls for more orbs

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Oh yes

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
Sex and in my

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
God of War

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
Shocking, but in a good way

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Ooh I can't believe

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
That just happened

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Oh we have a phone call, hi you're on orange lounge radio

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Who's this

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Hey how you doing

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
Oh hey

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Sup

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Not much, sup

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
Just chilling, enjoying

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Good stuff

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Interesting little story

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I'm chilling, I'm watching My Little Pony

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Just kicking back

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
That's what's up, that's how I roll

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Alright what's up

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I have a funny little story to have a nice interesting

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Story about Microsoft and I'll be on my merry little way

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Okay

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
First story is, oddly enough

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
If it wasn't for Raichan, I wouldn't be a fan of the show

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
And I wouldn't be pestering you guys for all these years

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Now, oh

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
So you are a fan of olr

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Thanks to Raichan

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
Me and Raichan, we go back like

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Ten plus years, hanging out on

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
On a forum site, wbs.net

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
Can you hold on a minute

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
Can you hold on a minute

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Yeah, yeah

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
God damn you

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
You ruined everything

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Oh shit, was I not on mute

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Hey Rob

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Can you scream a little louder

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
I don't think the dead heard you

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
You know what's funny, apparently right when I screamed

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
The internet went out again

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Which isn't, you're still on Skype

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
So I don't think that's possible, whatever

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
Alright, so anyway

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
That'll be one for the pod

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
And the podcast listeners

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Supposedly don't get any love

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Anyway

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Sorry, where were we

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
I was explaining how I became a fan of the show

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Yes, please

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
I mean, I'm just chatting online one day

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
And she just IMs me on ICQ

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
She's like, are you to like, be mining DDR

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
I was like, what here

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
And she's like, check this out

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
What was your number on ICQ

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
You just aged everything ten years

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
When you brought up ICQ

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Well, we're already on a ten year delay

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
I'm still logged on to it right now

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
My number is

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
10719559

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Uh oh

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Uh oh

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
That was my old boss's message tone

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Uh oh

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Well it was everybody's on ICQ

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
No, no, I mean on her phone

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Uh oh, ew

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Okay, so she messaged you on ICQ

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
And your computer went, uh oh

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Yeah, pretty much

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
And then everybody in OLR went

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Wait, was that right

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
And then everybody in OLR

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
went, uh oh

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Ah, that was great

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Oh wait, here we go, here we go, here we go

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
This is great

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Uh oh

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Oh, that's the sound I make every time

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Oh look, the phone's lighting up

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
And it's Ranma

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
I wonder if there's somebody out there

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
That has their ringtone or text message

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
For their phone

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
How about the ICQ sound remix

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
That apparently exists out there

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Oh god

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Uh, OT pain

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Is this dubstep?

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Not yet, not enough screeching

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
Okay, anyway

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Hi Ranma, what's new?

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
That's a notorious SKIE, huh

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
I'm sorry?

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
That's a notorious SKIE, huh

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Yes, oh

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Blackwool says the ICQ song needs to go into rotation

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
Take a vote on it right now

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
That's right, looks like

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Dark Tetsuya voted for it too

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
So I think that passes

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
We're gonna get that in the vlog stream

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
ICQ remix coming soon

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Alright, Ranma, anything else

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
you wanted to share with us

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
I think I overran my time

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
So I'm gonna get a bun out of here

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Love you, mean it

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Sure you do, you mean it for every bullet so far

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Love you too

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
I'm out

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Bye

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
It is strange how

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
well some people's voices lend them to

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
recreate sounds like that

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
People, I don't know if I've ever

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
really been pitchy on the show

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype is OrangeLawnsRadio

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I don't know if I've ever really been pitchy on the show

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
I know I've laughed pretty high pitched a couple times

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
tonight, but I would never have expected you to be able

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
to recreate that tone, ever

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
There's a lot of things I can do

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
you can't even possibly imagine

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Episode 469

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Live

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
I do the Muppets too

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
Their voices, their voices

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Near

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Far

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Near

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Far

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Oh god

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Kermit the Frog

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Do I really want to go into an inside joke like that?

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Probably not

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Live radio

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
It's moments

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
like these where I can only

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:34.000
think of this

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Call

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Hold on

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
We got a call coming in? Here we go

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Oh hi, who's this?

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Hello

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Hello

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Manomina

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
No, that's terrible

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Who is this?

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
It's Shane

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Hey Shane, what's up?

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Nothing, I just realized that

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
I can't really plug courthouse this week

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
because I won't be on it

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
So did you call into my other radio show

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
just to tell me that?

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Yes

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
I already figured that out actually earlier

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
I didn't

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
So I thought you should be the first to know

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Well thank you for that important announcement

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Hey guess what y'all, Shane will not be on

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Hoard House this week, in other news

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
this is the week to listen to Hoard House

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Wow

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
Just kidding, I'm kidding

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Who's gonna do the Facebook

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
Who's gonna do the Facebook question of the week now?

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
I don't know

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
but it won't be me

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
What, you have no Google Plus listeners at Hoard House?

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
I don't even think Hoard House

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
Is that one person not listening?

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
I don't even think Hoard House has a Google Plus account

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
sadly

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Is that all you called in to talk about?

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
What?

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Is that all you called in to talk about?

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
No, I called in to say everybody needs to also

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
purchase Guild Wars 2

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
because it's fantastic

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Ah yes, you've been playing in the beta

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
What's so great about Guild Wars 2?

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
It's pretty

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
and the combat's fun

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
and it's also free to play once you buy it

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
It's pretty fun

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Did you say it's free to play once you buy it?

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
Yeah, like there's no monthly fee

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
No subscription, yeah I got that

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
So it's similar

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
It's similarly different to World of Warcraft

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
You stole my word

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
Alright

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
You're full of hate tonight

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
It's a problem

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Ah, that's great

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
I learned from you Shane

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
I learned from you and since you're not gonna be on

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Hoard House this week I had to make up for it

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
Clearly

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
I'm

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
What am I not full of hate? Alright

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
I don't know

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
You're extra hateful tonight

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
So are you allowed to talk about where you're at

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
right now or should I not talk about that on air?

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Why is it confidential?

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
I don't know

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
I don't know either, I'm asking you why is it

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
confidential? Because

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
of the nature of your work now, I don't know

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
No

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
I'm up in Redman, Washington

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
training at Nintendo

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Are you having fun?

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Yes, it's very pretty here

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Like everybody should just look to Redman

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
because that's what I want to do now

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
The Pacific Northwest is really beautiful, I haven't been to Redman specifically

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
but I love Seattle, Seattle's great

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Should go back for PAX

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
That's next week so I can't

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
Is that really next week?

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
Isn't it?

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
PAX is over Labor Day weekend again, it's the same time as

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Dragon Con

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
I thought it was the end of August

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Which would be next week

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
That's like three weeks

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
Oh, I don't know

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
I can't go

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
That's too much money, but I would love to now

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
I always want to go to PAX if it's up here

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
August 31 through September 2nd

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
That's what, three weeks away?

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
That's the same time as Dragon Con

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
Well, Redman

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
is like a little village inside a forest

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
It's beautiful

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
It's like a little village inside a forest

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
How far are you from Seattle?

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
Like 30 minutes

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Oh, that's further than I would have thought

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Well, that's how long the cab ride took

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
The $81 cab ride

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Holy moly

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
That's a ways away

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
I didn't pay for it, so I don't care

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
Alright, well I want to hear all the dirt

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
even if you can't talk about it on OLR

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
I want to hear all the dirt about your first trip to Nintendo headquarters tomorrow

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
That's fine, I will do that

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:36.000
And let us know if you bump into Reggie or anybody really exciting

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
How is Reggie exciting?

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
I don't know

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
Be sure to ask him if his body is ready

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
I'm sure he hasn't heard that enough

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Oh god, that really was the highlight of E3

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
He did say Reggie

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
I don't even remember that

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
He did say Reggie OR somebody exciting

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
So, okay, if I meet Mario tomorrow

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Like actual Mario, not Charles Martinette

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
I'll let you know

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Or Derpy Mario

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
I don't know if you've been listening to the show

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
But the Derpy Mario from Florida might show up

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
I don't know

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
You know what, in fact

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
I think you need to report Derpy Mario actually

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
I'm going to help you out

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
You need to put that in a feedback box somewhere

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
If there's a suggestion box on the wall

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
Please arrest Derpy Mario in Tampa, Florida

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
Well, I would need some sort of like

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Like proof of Derpy Mario

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
The picture is on Kotaku

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
The picture is on Kotaku

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
The picture is on Kotaku

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
The picture is on Kotaku

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
It's on, alright, I'll email you

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
I'll email you the link

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
Alright, I gotta let you go to get some more calls

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Anything else?

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
No, my whole

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
Studio

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Hotel room is powered by a key card

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
That I have to plug into the wall

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
And if I take it away it turns everything off

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
It's weird

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Those hotels are actually really nice

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Yeah, it's $300 a night apparently

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
Wow

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
It's like

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Guy from middle of nowhere, Kansas

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Ends up in the big city or the village in the forest

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Where you have to plug things into walls

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
In order to get power

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
It's weird, you have to make power

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
Like a freaking water

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
What are those called?

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
Those water wheel things?

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
Hydroelectric power?

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Sure, there we go

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
Alright, I will talk to you later Shane

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
Take care

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
Bye

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
Let's try to fit in at least one more call

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
For the night before we say goodnight

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
Hey guys, it's Porkchop

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
Hey Porkchop, how you doing?

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
Not bad, just on all you guys who are all

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Knowing, I heard you talk about the move

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
And I'm just wondering, I'm thinking of buying it

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
But what exactly can I do with it?

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
I mean I have a couple of games I can use it with

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
But is there anything else that I could really do with it

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
That's worthwhile

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
I'm sorry, but all I have to say is

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
And I know this is a radio show

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
Your Skype picture is cracking me

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
The hell up

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
I'm glad, I didn't think you could see it before

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
But I'm glad you can see it now

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
Yes, we can all see it here in studio

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
And it's cracking me up

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
Because to describe it for listeners at home

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
He's literally wearing a tinfoil hat

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
That makes him look like

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
It's a tinfoil helmet

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
He looks like a superhero or something

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
But he looks like

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
Sir Tin of Foil

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
It's a very phallic, foily head

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
That he's got there

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Sir Reynolds of Rap

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
He's like a metallic luchador

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Thank you

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
He's a metallic luchador

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
But the expression on his face is like

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
Hey

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
He's like the happy luchador

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Hey

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
I'ma body slam you now

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Anyhow

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Episode 469

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
Thank you

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
You should get the PlayStation Move

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
To play it in that helmet

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
And upload those videos to SingStar

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
You would be the number one ranked player in the world

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
I would do that just for you

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
Seeing as you ask so nicely

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
I would do that if I can get SingStar

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
No problem

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
And please make sure it's SingStar, Abba

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
Loki, you have some suggestions

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
What could he do with the move?

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
Well, there's

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
All their first person shooter games support the move

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
And they have also their gun thing

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
I don't remember what it's called

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
Well, Sports Champions

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
Is pretty fun with the move

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
Also, apparently

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
Child of Eden is really good

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
With the move

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
They've got some move exclusive games

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
But they're kind of just so-so

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
I don't know

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Let me put it this way

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
A lot of that move stuff is probably

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
Really discounted right now

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
So you could probably take a pretty good

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Look through a dump bin

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Somewhere or a discount bin

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
In one of these stores and find a bunch of that move stuff

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
But yeah, I'd say

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Probably Sports Champions is really good

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Although, if you want to wait, Sports Champions

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
2 is coming out

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
I don't know if it has some of the

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
I think it has some of the same events in there

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
But I mean, it's got frisbee golf

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
That's kind of fun, I played the archery

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Archery is really cool

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
How is LittleBigPlanet's move implementation?

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
It's supposed to be pretty good

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
They've got a lot of new stuff with that

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
LittleBigPlanet 2 would be a good one

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
If you like Heavy Rain

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
I don't know how good that would be

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
Yeah, I got that

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
You can use it as a mouse

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:24.000
Yeah, that's hacking stuff

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
Actually, yeah

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
A lot of the games are pretty accurate

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
It works pretty well with whatever

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
It's just whatever type of games you like

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
I know they tried some of the party stuff

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
In the very beginning and that was kind of crap

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
But stick with the sports games

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
If you like the dancing games

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
I'm sure it works well with it

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.000
You could basically pretend you're playing Wii games

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
That work

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
Yeah

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Well, I got Heavy Rain and Resident Evil 5

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
So I think that should pretty much

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Keep me going until I can pick up some other ones

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
That sounds pretty good

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
Sounds like a lot of stuff you're going to find in the clearance bin

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
Pretty soon, unfortunately

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
But hey, however you can find the deal, right?

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
I picked them up cheap anyway

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
King Star Abba, that's on my list

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
Alright, as it should be on everybody's list

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
It's fun

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
Alright, Porkchop, before I let you go so we can close up the show

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Anything else on your mind tonight?

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
Yes, Konami, if you fuck up

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Zone of the Enders HD collection

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
I will fucking kill you

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
In that helmet

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
Yeah, he will wear that helmet

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
Professor Chaos!

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
That's it

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:36.000
You need a battle axe made out of tinfoil

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
I just need a special move now

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
Wait, I have to say it

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
Because over here it's aluminum

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
There's an aluminium

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Really?

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
We just said tinfoil

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
Why make it so damn complicated?

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
We're that lazy, we don't give a shit

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
Cover your food with it, that's it

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
Tinfoil

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
Make hats, make axes, whatever

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
I love it

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
Alright, Porkchop, I got to let you go to Close Up Shop

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000
Have a good one, buddy

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000
Have a good one, Rusty guys

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
Will do, bye

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
I love the listeners

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
187, oh wait no, I'm closing up Sky

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
I'm sorry if you didn't get through

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
But it's like 9.30 already

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
And I want a milkshake

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
We need to wrap up here and get out of here

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
What? Milkshake

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
Does it bring all the boys to the yard?

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
I don't care, it brings fat to my butt

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
It's the Dark Sakura version

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
Wait, hold on, hold on

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
No

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000
You asked for it, you asked for it

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
No

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
God, you're awful

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
No

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
La la la la la

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
Ha ha

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000
Ha ha ha

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
Thank you for YouTube ads

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000
Alright, here we go

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000
Unmute me

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000
My milkshake brings all my fat to the butt

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
And I'm like

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
Damn right, it's fat on my butt

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000
They all want me

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
When I walk into the gym

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000
Like this

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
Damn right I went to Pinkberry

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
And I was like

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Yo, supersize

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.000
You can't have mine

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
And there's your singing

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
For episode 469

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
Is there a meme

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
We haven't covered?

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000
Okay

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000
Oh, I think I need to do um

03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000
I need to do Twitter topics

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000
Are you

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
feeling a little emotional, Rob?

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.000
I'm so emotional

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
baby

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
You had to bring

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
Whitney into this, can't you let that poor

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000
woman rest in peace? Never

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
Damn

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
She's still got a movie coming out, alright?

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
She's dead and got a movie coming out

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
It's amazing what they can do with technology

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
Alright, look, tweets

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:20.000
First off, Tigerclaw

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
They actually tried that with Bruce Lee

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000
and Tupac

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000
Alright, uh

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000
Great, Travis

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:30.000
is inviting me on Understation live next week

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
and do white boys sing along

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
Why not, sure

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000
Alright, Tigerclaw

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000
tweets us

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
and you'll be interested in this, a fan-made

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
Mass Effect adventure game that surfaces

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
Is that that Mass Effect universe?

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.000
It's called Finding Shepherd

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000
and it's on the Adventure Game Studios

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000
It's created by one of the users on the forums

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000
Nightfable. Finding Shepherd, it's in

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.000
progress right now, but it's set in the Mass Effect

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.000
universe directly following Mass Effect

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000
3. It assumes that you took

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
the destroy ending, that's all we're

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
going to say about that, but what's cool about

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
this game, if you kind of look at some of the early screenshots

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
it looks like a LucasArts game or something

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.000
That's kind of rad

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.000
Do you press S for Shepherd?

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
Shepherd? Shepherd?

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000
Shepherd? Shepherd?

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.000
You seem to have Mass Effect

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.000
confused with heavy rain

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
Alright

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000
Uh, let's see

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000
Tigerclaw

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000
also sends us one more tweet about how

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000
GameStop is one of the worst places to

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
work in America

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000
It's just number 10

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
Is it really? It's only number 10? Yeah, it's number 10

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Uh, actually I had pulled this up

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
Number 1 is Dish Network

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000
Number 2 is Dillard's

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000
Number 3 is Radio Shack

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:46.000
Number 4 is Perch

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000
Number 6 is Sears slash Kmart

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000
Number 7 is

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000
Robert Halfer International, which I have no idea who they are

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.000
Kmart is tough to work for because you have to work

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:56.000
with mummies Number 8 is Hewlett-Packard

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000
Number 9 is Rite Aid

03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000
and number 10 is GameStop

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000
followed by Bank of New York Mellon

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.000
Sears

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000
slash Kmart? Was that a tie?

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:08.000
Or are they the same company?

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:10.000
They're the same company Kmart and Sears

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.000
had a merger with Holdings

03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:14.000
Oh, imagine that

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000
Babymon, who wants to plug his best friend

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000
made some Papercraft Legend

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.000
of Zelda, which is available as posters

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:22.000
on Etsy

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.000
I got to admit, some of these are really cute

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000
They're kind of the Phantom Hourglass style

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000
That's cute

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.000
You should plug that in the chat room

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000
That link's a little long for me to read on air

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.000
But it's on Etsy, just search Papercraft Zelda

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:36.000
I guess

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.000
Oh, sends a tweet with more pictures

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.000
That one's really cute, I like the Mario one

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:42.000
I would hang that in my house

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.000
I want this game now, because you play as Jack

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
Anyhow

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.000
Thank you for the tweets

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:50.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:52.000
to send us tweets in a future week

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:54.000
But you know what? We have got to close up the show

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000
Oh, last minute stories

03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.000
Let us Jack have a picture of Miranda in a room

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
I have no last minute stories

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000
Well then I guess it's time to end

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000
episode number 469

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000
So

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000
First off, I want to thank our guests

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:10.000
for being here tonight

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000
Thank you so much for making the drive

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000
All the way from Colorado

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.000
Huh?

03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000
It was a drive and Colorado was involved

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.000
But I'll take it

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.000
Thank you Jason for being here tonight

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:24.000
Appreciate it

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000
And do you have any last minute thoughts?

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000
Final thoughts?

03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:30.000
I cry from laughing

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000
Way too much

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:34.000
Ryan, thank you so much

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.000
You made it finally to a show

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:38.000
Yay, finally

03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:40.000
And I'm with Jason

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.000
My head hurts and I've been

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.000
laughing so hard I was crying earlier

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:46.000
All the feels

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000
Is that your final thought tonight?

03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.000
I think so

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
Alright, well thank you for being here and please

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000
come back again sometime

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000
And I swear I'll get you a better mic next time

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000
Alright, let's see

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000
I want a kitten, but Shermie is too fat and would sit on her

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000
I drink too much water

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000
And my final thought tonight is

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000
La la la la la

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
Thank you guys so much

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000
I thought your final thought would have been

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000
Uh oh

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000
That's what happens when you drink too much water

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.000
Uh oh

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000
See that sounds like either

03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000
ICQ or lemmings

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000
That's what happens when I eat at Chipotle

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000
Uh oh

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:30.000
Followed by

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.000
Oh I'm so glad we could have a poop joke

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000
before the show was over

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000
Thank you, Loki

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000
We've already had dick

03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:42.000
I'm sorry, alien dildo

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
Really? We got dick? Where?

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000
Alright, that's it

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000
We're done. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000
or listening to us live however it is

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000
and checking out. Thank you for participating with

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Orange Lounge Radio

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000
You made it all the way to the end of the show

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:58.000
I really want to thank you guys

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000
for your continued support week after week

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000
You guys rock, thank you so much

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
Please, if you enjoyed what you heard

03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000
Just tell a friend or two about the show

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.000
Because if you can believe it, we've been doing this for 469 episodes

03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000
And we're somehow still not

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:12.000
number one on iTunes

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000
In fact, we're like number 204

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
I look today

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000
So, please tell a friend or five

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000
about the show

03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:22.000
Spread the word, iTunes, Stitcher Radio, whatever

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.000
the kids use these days to listen to podcasts

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:26.000
The podcast app on iTunes, whatever

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.000
Listen to the show, spread the word

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:30.000
Tell a friend

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000
Thank you so much for being here

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.000
And I guess we'll come back next week to do it all again

03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:36.000
How's that sound?

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000
I guess

03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:40.000
Have a great week everybody, we'll see you next time

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:42.000
here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
Orange Lounge Radio

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:48.000
is a production of

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:50.000
OLR Studios

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:52.000
To join us for a live show

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.000
tune into

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000
vaughnetwork.com

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000
Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific

03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000
9 p.m. Eastern

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000
The views and opinions expressed

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:04.000
in this program do not necessarily

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:06.000
reflect those of the staff

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.000
of Orange Lounge Radio

03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:10.000
or Vaugh Network

03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:12.000
But you know they were all still true

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:40.000
See you next week!

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000
We just don't want

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000
the party to stop y'all

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.000
We forgot to do this during the live show

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:50.000
so we're gonna attach this on here

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
at the very end. We just had so much stuff that was

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:54.000
given away tonight between that code that the

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.000
emailer had and then the code that you were gonna

03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.000
email us for. We forgot to

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.000
announce who's gonna win this and get

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000
Bradley's bag of PAX shit

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000
that he got. That's right, that's the

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000
sound of the bag. So now you're getting

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000
a bag of PAX stuff that's been fondled

03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:10.000
by Jason

03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:12.000
That just increased the value

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:14.000
by.01 cents

03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.000
He totally felt it up while we watched

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:18.000
Amazing. DarkSakura

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:20.000
pick a number between one and

03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.000
what I told you before we started

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:24.000
Four. Four! One

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.000
Two, three, four

03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:28.000
Congratulations William Murderface

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.000
Yay!

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:32.000
And what a lovely pleasant name to be giving

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.000
a bag of crap to. It's from

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:36.000
It's from Metalocalypse

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:38.000
It's from Metalocalypse

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:40.000
It's from Murderface

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:42.000
Somebody you could take home to mom

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000
There you go

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000
Really weird looking dude

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:48.000
So now we're really getting the party

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:50.000
Thank you for staying all the way to the very very

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:52.000
bitter end podcasties

03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:54.000
Congratulations William Huggleface

03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000
I'm gonna change his name temporarily

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000
Yeah, that's it

03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.000
On to your next podcast

03:19:00.000 --> 03:19:10.000
Thanks for watching and have a great day!
