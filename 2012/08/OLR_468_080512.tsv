0	19320	Tonight, August 5th, 2012, another MMO is set to go free-to-play.
19320	22880	Someone decides to take Zinga to court over an allegedly copied game.
22880	29840	And has the Wii U detailed launch lineup been revealed?
29840	35640	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35640	38200	where every gamer has a voice.
38200	46400	It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 468 for August the 5th of 2012.
46400	50280	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you with my co-host over the next few hours
50280	54120	to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff.
54120	55120	Here they are.
55120	57840	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
57840	58840	Olga.
58840	59840	How's it going?
59840	60840	I'm kind of in pain.
60840	61840	You're in pain?
61840	62840	You're hurting?
62840	63840	I hurt.
63840	65840	A cafe mocha didn't make it better?
65840	67480	No, my soul is broken.
67480	69840	I'm sorry, why is your soul broken?
69840	70840	I got laid off.
70840	71840	Aww.
71840	72840	Sad face.
72840	73840	Actually, I'm really okay with it.
73840	74840	Yeah?
74840	75840	I mean, I'm kind of okay with it.
75840	76840	I mean, not really.
76840	78840	I mean, I want chocolate and more Pinkberry, please.
78840	80840	It's the economy.
80840	85640	No, it's Bank of America, but I'm not going to say anything else.
85640	88400	But maybe a silver lining to it all, at least I hope.
88400	90080	We're all pulling for you.
90080	91080	Something will come up.
91080	92080	We'll see.
92080	94400	If you listen to Bobby Black Wolf Show, let me just plug real quick.
94400	97440	Maybe I could work for Zynga and get sued.
97440	102940	Listen to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network and participate at live.vognetwork.com, where
102940	107600	we do tape Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby
107600	108600	Black Wolf Show.
108600	112600	And as we learned on Bobby Black Wolf tonight, you never know who might recruit you.
112600	114800	So tune into that.
114800	115800	You know what?
115800	117800	I don't think I could work for evil.
117800	118800	All right.
118800	119800	Moving on.
119800	122360	Say hello to evil tech master Loki.
122360	125240	I could if they pay well.
125240	126720	We slaughter kittens.
126720	127760	Okay.
127760	129600	Do I hear a hundred dollars for your soul?
129600	131120	A hundred, a hundred, two hundred.
131120	132800	How you doing, tech master Loki?
132800	136800	I mean, maybe virtual kittens, but it's not, not real.
136800	138560	Stop that's wrong.
138560	139560	What's up?
139560	140560	What's new?
140560	141560	Doing fine.
141560	142560	Yeah.
142560	143560	What was this project thingy?
143560	145520	You were showing me pictures of a project thingy you've been working on.
145520	147080	Oh, it was just brief.
147080	150440	I was trying to make something for Josh's birthday party because he had a Mario themed
150440	151840	birthday party.
151840	156080	But is this to match his Mario themed bedroom and so forth?
156080	157080	Well, it's just this year.
157080	158400	Cause last year was pork themed.
158400	166680	So we decided that I love that you threw a baby, a port themed wedding or wedding birthday.
166680	168680	One step at a time.
168680	169680	Okay.
169680	170680	Seriously.
170680	177440	Maybe later on down the line, I'd be down.
177440	180880	But no, he had a Mario birthday party.
180880	181880	All right.
181880	182880	That was fun.
182880	187280	So you made like a little paper mache coupe, or no, that was more like a paper, paper craft
187280	188280	Koopa.
188280	189880	It looked like origami or something.
189880	193880	And it's, it's pretty much full size.
193880	195600	It's over two feet tall.
195600	201000	But the thing is I didn't finish it because I neglected to look at the paper craft model
201000	202000	that closely.
202000	207320	And apparently the way they have things connect together are impossible in reality because
207320	209480	they just kind of phase through each other.
209480	213760	Yeah, that might work in like a computer game, but it's not going to work when you have to
213760	215200	glue stuff to other things.
215200	219600	It's like, okay, I have to cut a hole here, I guess, in order to get this to work.
219600	226600	I managed to get two of the pieces together before the show, like his leg in the shoe,
226600	229480	and that was a pain in the ass.
229480	231760	This is going to take a long time.
231760	234120	You're the one that wanted to start arts and crafts with your video game.
234120	235120	Hey, but it's pretty much done.
235120	236120	I mean, it's just-
236120	237120	No, the pictures look good.
237120	238120	Yeah.
238120	239120	It was good.
239120	240680	We should try to get those up at orangelaunchvideo.com.
240680	243440	But anyhow, let's also introduce, we have a special guest tonight.
243440	247000	I mean, it's a big night at the Voice of Geeks Network, and I'll explain why in just a little
247000	252560	bit, but a big night made bigger by the return of a favorite guest to OLR.
252560	254740	He hasn't been here in some time.
254740	258560	The last time I remember you being here was the marathon show, maybe one show after that,
258560	261280	but you definitely haven't been here since the vlog switchover and all that.
261280	264560	Say hello to Arkadian42 is back.
264560	265560	Whose favorite?
265560	267560	It's been a while, yeah.
267560	270200	Probably some of them last year.
270200	271840	Yeah, so welcome back.
271840	273840	Maybe it was earlier this year, actually.
273840	274840	Maybe.
274840	275840	But it was in the old-
275840	276840	Yeah, it was in the old place.
276840	277840	Yeah.
277840	281080	So welcome to the smaller, condensed studio.
281080	283480	That's at Casa de Rob and Alan.
283480	287320	So actually fit a little bit better here with the open environment rather than a little
287320	288320	room.
288320	289320	That's true.
289320	290320	And you know what?
290320	291320	Sometimes it works pretty good.
291320	292960	Like last week when we had the whole PlayStation Home thing going on, you know, it was going
292960	294160	on on the TV over there.
294160	297920	So it's like, you know, we got, we got a nice open space and once in a while a cat might
297920	299160	come through and try to lick your feet.
299160	300160	So we'll see.
300160	301160	Not likely.
301160	302160	Yes.
302160	306000	Now, Marco might walk by, stick his tail in the air and then run off.
306000	308520	Not bloody likely.
308520	313480	So if folks haven't heard you on the show before, let's try to tell the listeners a
313480	316040	little bit about, like, what you're all about.
316040	317360	You're a huge, like, Sega fan.
317360	318560	I remember that about you, right?
318560	319560	Something like that.
319560	322000	I have a lot, you played a lot of Sega games when I was growing up.
322000	329560	So I had, like, a Genesis and Saturn, basically I bought a bunch of, I have a bunch of Japanese
329560	330560	Saturn games, though.
330560	335800	I haven't played loads of them, just because I've never gotten really great Japanese knowledge.
335800	339640	So a lot of them are kind of hard to play when you don't have a full, uh, you're not
339640	341940	fully, uh, fluent in it.
341940	343080	You just want to have the games.
343080	344080	No, no.
344080	347240	I sympathize with this because me trying to play through Grandia was hilarious.
347240	348240	Yeah.
348240	352680	And I kind of played up to where the translation ran out when I was playing it sometime like
352680	357200	in into college and then didn't ever got past that.
357200	358600	I got back to it anyway.
358600	362760	I know you also do a lot of traveling, like following you on Facebook and everything you
362760	365840	love to go on the, or at least it seems like reading your Facebook, you love to go on these
365840	367560	like kind of like just adventures.
367560	371740	Like I'm going to get in the car and drive to, um, a Yellowstone.
371740	372740	See you later.
372740	373740	Yeah.
373740	374740	Yeah.
374740	375740	Yeah.
375740	376740	Pretty much a big road.
376740	379400	I've done a big road trip the last two or three years and then I haven't done too many
379400	380400	small road trips.
380400	382900	I've been going to Yosemite a bunch for hiking.
382900	384520	You climbed Half Dome this year, right?
384520	385520	Yep.
385520	386520	Congrats.
386520	387520	Four years ago.
387520	391940	And you didn't get killed, which is a thing that unfortunately has a bit of a reputation
391940	392940	for these days.
392940	398200	But you know, you only get killed if you're stupid, allegedly, allegedly they should change
398200	399520	it to half Darwin allegedly.
399520	400520	Yeah.
400520	404760	Cause like, oh, I think there's only been like one person who's died on a, on a dry
404760	405760	day.
405760	408200	They might've had a little bit to drink.
408200	409200	Yeah.
409200	413400	But every other times, most every other time was when it was stormy or wet or there was
413400	415920	a thunderstorm or something around.
415920	417360	I knew someone got close.
417360	422360	Like like two months ago, we almost fell off the side.
422360	426480	I know you like to kind of sometimes go to expos and conventions and things too, because
426480	428560	you're kind of like the norm of these things.
428560	432240	Like, you know, remember Cheers and it's kind of like, you know, I'll be at California extreme
432240	434520	and then all of a sudden, oh, Bradley's through the door.
434520	436520	Bradley is here.
436520	438000	Did you go to California extreme this year?
438000	439000	Yes.
439000	440000	I just knew you did.
440000	443320	And I was, I was so, I was irritated.
443320	444320	I couldn't go.
444320	446160	I mean, granted, you know, I have to pick my priorities.
446160	450240	Do I want to do screening movie thingies or do I want to do a California stream?
450240	451800	And I went into Dan midnight movie.
451800	452800	Yes.
452800	453800	I ran him to once.
453800	454800	Yeah.
454800	458700	Like I saw, I was playing like a kung fu master and he was stopped by and said, hi.
458700	461640	So how was it since we couldn't review it, none of us went, how was the California stream
461640	462640	this year?
462640	463640	That was pretty good.
463640	467640	Uh, pretty much, uh, similar, similar to his usual lot, bunch of games here and there and
467640	468640	everywhere.
468640	473760	A bunch and can't remember if there's anything super special there that there was a bunch
473760	476280	of new pinballs, but I didn't get to play them.
476280	477280	Nice.
477280	479000	I don't have a new, but at least newer ones.
479000	480200	Did they have the Tron pinball?
480200	481780	I have yet to play that still.
481780	482780	Dan's friend owns one.
482780	484760	Oh, I'm going to visit Dan's friend.
484760	485760	The special editions.
485760	487360	Can't remember if I saw one or not.
487360	488360	It might've been there.
488360	490340	I just didn't, I didn't, I didn't get a chance to play it.
490340	493360	Now if you're not around the Bay area, I know we've talked about this on the show before,
493360	495200	but let's say you haven't heard it before.
495200	498240	California extreme is like this convention, I guess for lack of a better term, they call
498240	502760	it a convention that they do at San Jose convention center.
502760	503960	I think it was.
503960	507960	And basically it's just, they know it was at a hotel last time I went, I don't know.
507960	509360	It probably varies from year to year.
509360	514080	I think they've had the, like the Hyatt down there for, but it's just, yeah, it's just
514080	520980	all these arcade owners, private owners, mostly that own old arcade games and they just convene
520980	524280	on a convention center or a hotel ballroom.
524280	528560	And it's just all these games you pay 40, 50 bucks and it's just free to play the whole
528560	529560	weekend.
529560	530560	All these old games.
530560	532240	And it's really an emphasis on classic games.
532240	536920	And I've got to play so much stuff that you just don't get to play anywhere anymore.
536920	541160	Like I played journey last, the last time I was there and you know, some pinball games
541160	545360	once in a while they have a couple new things here and there, but it's mostly about classic,
545360	551320	but I've got to say, um, Neil, a friend of mine, he sent me a video from California extreme,
551320	552880	I guess like, I don't know what it was.
552880	556480	It was one of those like animatronic bands.
556480	562120	He sent me a very scary video of the animatronic band singing total eclipse of the heart or
562120	563120	something.
563120	564120	I was like, what is this?
564120	565120	Yeah.
565120	566120	I went by there just like once.
566120	571840	I kind of just passed by and went solid for like 10 seconds and went on to something else.
571840	572840	Nice.
572840	575680	Awesome is what it is.
575680	578680	Well you know, and I'll get into this in a little bit.
578680	583000	Maybe if Loki had gone to California extreme, he might've found a robotron 2084 machine.
583000	588080	Yeah, they did have one of those there to figure out who owned that, but we'll come
588080	590920	back to that in a little bit and Bradley, I'll talk to you a little more about what
590920	592320	you've been playing recently.
592320	593640	A little later in the show.
593640	595520	Uh, of course you guys are here too.
595520	599480	The always present fourth guest on our show, or I guess fifth tonight because we do have
599480	601000	Arcadia 42 here tonight.
601000	606000	Uh, join us live, participate with the show live at VOG network, the voice EECS network
606000	612160	live dot vog network.com is where you can join our chat room and occasionally we read
612160	618200	comments from our chat room and uh, yeah, DDR dollar bill is like, why it's robotron.
618200	625080	It's robo or robo Tran, no robotron, robo, they do have it on xbox live arcade and robo.
625080	626760	It was one of the first xbox live arcade.
626760	627760	I haven't.
627760	628760	Yeah.
628760	632880	Robo Tran was a rejected 2d x character, just saying little inside joke there for the music
632880	633880	game fans.
633880	634880	All right.
634880	637480	We'd like to do a kickoff topic here on the show.
637480	642240	Every week we, um, you know, kind of start off the show with what's a big thing going
642240	648180	on in the world and I got to tell you, everybody's got Olympic fever this week.
648180	653760	It's all about the Olympics and it gives me an excuse to play this song.
653760	668360	Did you really London 2012 was it 92 theme play that too.
668360	674400	The Olympic event on a 12 hour tape delay live from London.
674400	677120	Just change the am to PM anyhow.
677120	680840	I don't actually really want to talk about like the Olympics itself, but I want to talk
680840	684400	about, cause you know, you can probably go to any other website on the internet and read
684400	686240	something about Michael Phelps.
686240	689720	But what I really want to talk about is I want to talk about a story that's circulating
689720	692520	the internet and I'm talking, when I'm talking circulating the internet, I don't mean just
692520	693520	like on the video game blogs.
693520	697240	I mean, this is on cnn.com and their tech section right now.
697240	699920	So on CNN, they're running a story right now.
699920	703160	Should pro gamers be considered athletes?
703160	704160	And I think that's a good question.
704160	705160	I want to ask you guys tonight.
705160	707240	Oh, you're just, you're starting off with a bang.
707240	708240	No, why not?
708240	710680	Why should pro gamers not be considered athletes?
710680	711740	Because it's a video game.
711740	714880	It doesn't really require any physical prowess to be good at it.
714880	721480	Maybe some good hand eye coordination, but the Olympics are traditionally a test of physical
721480	722480	skill.
722480	728440	Like maybe DDR, I don't know, but it has, it should be something purely physical.
728440	732800	Well, let me, let me read some of the quotes from this article before I get too much more
732800	733800	feedback.
733800	737960	I'll put it back in our chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com and the article talks
737960	742440	about Starcraft 2 and one of the big players in South Korea, Marine King.
742440	748360	And he got kind of a bit of a reputation because he practiced 20 hours a day sometimes.
748360	751840	And that got him called a gaming addict.
751840	755840	But according to, and CNN basically compiled some comments and according to one commenter
755840	762540	on the CNN website, one person said, would you claim that Phelps is addicted to swimming?
762540	766380	So why did they want to say this guy was addicted to gaming because he trained 20 hours a week.
766380	768360	Would you say that Michael Phelps is addicted to swimming?
768360	772240	No, he's addicted to pot.
772240	775540	Anyone who can smoke weed and then win 21 gold medals.
775540	776540	You know what?
776540	777540	You win.
777540	778540	You know what?
778540	779540	Didn't slow him down.
779540	780540	I'm not saying that's bad.
780540	781860	It didn't slow him down any.
781860	786120	Not that I personally endorse it, but I'm just, it is, it is kind of funny.
786120	789120	It does set that whole argument back a little bit, doesn't it?
789120	795000	Some folks say, Marine King represents dedication, skill, perseverance.
795000	798440	He's one of the best in the world.
798440	801720	The skill required to be a pro gamer.
801720	805160	The original article that the folks had commented on, it didn't distinguish the difference between
805160	808200	game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby.
808200	812080	I do not believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the
812080	816200	world or how truly big professional gaming has become.
816200	821080	On physicality being an important part of athletics, again, these comments from CNN.com.
821080	822920	I wouldn't call them athletes.
822920	826960	The one common denominator with all Olympians is the physicality involved.
826960	829880	Even the word athlete refers to physical activity.
829880	834560	I have no issues with video gaming, but the Olympics just seems to be the wrong venue.
834560	835560	Exactly.
835560	838880	You know what venue that the Olympics needs?
838880	839880	Fuck this video game playing.
839880	841980	It's all about fucking laser tag.
841980	842980	Laser tag.
842980	845220	That is physical.
845220	846220	That is awesome.
846220	847220	That is what we need.
847220	849100	But then they could just do paintball.
849100	850440	I'd be fine with paintball.
850440	853200	I'd settle for paintball.
853200	854940	As long as they have to be active.
854940	859760	You know, I want like some crazy Hunger Games-ish thing, you know, where if they don't move,
859760	860760	then they explode.
860760	865900	Now that I'm not working, I think I should be a professional paintballer.
865900	868660	What about that for a career change, Rob?
868660	869660	You know what?
869660	870840	Now's the time to try new things.
870840	872520	Find what you really love.
872520	873760	I sure do love shooting people.
873760	875600	You could design guns.
875600	877160	You like design and you like guns.
877160	878160	You should design guns.
878160	880160	I'm gonna design a new gun.
880160	881160	Alright.
881160	882400	Uh, Loki, your thoughts.
882400	887600	Should this be, should video games, Starcraft 2 be an Olympic sport?
887600	888600	No.
888600	889600	Why not?
889600	890600	Because they don't do anything.
890600	894240	I mean, not saying they don't physically do anything.
894240	898760	Moving a mouse is not exercise or is not, you know, athletic in any way.
898760	899760	So no.
899760	900760	I'm sorry.
900760	901800	That does not belong.
901800	903880	Somebody in chat just said a comment.
903880	905680	Cyber Olympics or something like that.
905680	909920	You know, if we're gonna create something that, you know, sort of way, then yeah, sure,
909920	910920	why not.
910920	912240	Somebody in chat just said a comment.
912240	913560	I agree with 100%.
913560	915760	Um, Bradley, I'll check in with you.
915760	917440	You know, what, what do you think?
917440	920000	Do video games deserve to be in the Olympics or no?
920000	921000	No.
921000	924400	It's, yeah, it's not only athletic or anything, though.
924400	929800	They could do, like, a spectator, it's not a spectator, but a, what do you call that?
929800	930800	Uh.
930800	931800	Exhibition.
931800	932800	Exhibition sort of thing.
932800	933800	Because they did something like that.
933800	934800	I can do exhibitions.
934800	935800	Yeah.
935800	937800	Not that type of exhibition.
937800	941640	They did, like, I know they were talking about the last time that London had an Olympics,
941640	944120	they had, like, an Olympic poetry competition.
944120	945120	Olympic poetry?
945120	946120	Wait a minute.
946120	947120	This is dumb.
947120	948120	Yeah.
948120	949280	Is pole dancing an Olympic sport?
949280	950280	Because that's physical.
950280	951280	Wait.
951280	952280	You're Loki?
952280	953280	What, Loki?
953280	954280	I'm fine.
954280	955280	I'm liking this.
955280	956280	Okay.
956280	958000	You know what used to be an Olympic sport?
958000	959000	Solo synchronized swimming.
959000	960000	Hold on, hold on.
960000	962640	Let me change the, I want to change the question for a minute here.
962640	963640	Oh, one more thing?
963640	964640	What?
964640	965640	Tug of War used to be an Olympic sport.
965640	966640	Okay.
966640	969660	So you all say, no, video games should not be an Olympic sport, and I actually agree.
969660	972200	Video games should not be an Olympic sport, and I'll come back to why in a minute, but
972200	975760	I'm gonna change the question now, because I think that's gonna change some of your answers.
975760	977560	Should pole dancing be an Olympic sport?
977560	978560	Dark Sakura?
978560	979560	No.
979560	980560	Why not?
980560	981560	Because strippers.
981560	984160	Loki, should pole dancing be an Olympic sport?
984160	985440	Absolutely, and you know why?
985440	987840	Because it's not necessarily for strippers, yes.
987840	993000	I understand that that is what they do, but I mean, it's basically like the gymnastics
993000	995320	routines and stuff that they do, but just on a pole.
995320	996320	I mean-
996320	997440	Well, included in gymnastics.
997440	1001720	But it does require, you know, physical strength, and you know, there's a bit of like-
1001720	1003720	The ability to spread your legs.
1003720	1005720	No.
1005720	1011480	As someone who took a pole dancing class, it is not just about spreading your legs,
1011480	1012480	all right?
1012480	1016240	Well, I think it should be included under gymnastics.
1016240	1017240	I agree.
1017240	1018240	It should be under there.
1018240	1024280	I mean, because if you can have this stupid gymnastics event where you're prancing around
1024280	1029200	with giant ribbons, then I should be able to, you know, they should have somebody that's,
1029200	1031160	you know, prancing around on a pole.
1031160	1036400	Yeah, if, look, there's like a ball dance or something where the chicks come out and
1036400	1037400	play with balls.
1037400	1038400	Ribbons.
1038400	1039400	Balls and ribbons.
1039400	1040400	No, they have one as a sport.
1040400	1041400	That's a sport.
1041400	1042400	Yeah.
1042400	1043400	Yeah, there's like gymnastics-
1043400	1044400	It's like a rhythm ball, I think is what it is.
1044400	1045400	Yeah.
1045400	1046400	It's like Zumba.
1046400	1047400	Bradley?
1047400	1048400	Pole dancing?
1048400	1049400	Yes or no in the Olympics?
1049400	1052120	No, I wonder how they're going to go judging on that.
1052120	1057960	Oh, let's see, the lady from Russia had the most erect nipples.
1057960	1062580	Another one, I mean, to get it out of the gutter here a little bit, free running would
1062580	1065280	be kind of cool.
1065280	1069440	A lot of the X Games stuff, you know, you put a motorcycle in there and you can't really
1069440	1070440	go wrong.
1070440	1073100	You know, if we just combine the Olympics and the X Games together, maybe that would
1073100	1078200	be kind of like a gymnastics event for the, you know, the X Games would be like strippers.
1078200	1081960	Yeah, the problem is pole dancing has that stigma attached to it and it's not classy
1081960	1082980	enough for the Olympics.
1082980	1084360	That's why it would not, you know.
1084360	1089240	I'm sure pole dancing can be done very classily, classily, classic.
1089240	1090240	What's a good word?
1090240	1091240	It can be done with class.
1091240	1092240	Not trashy.
1092240	1093240	With class.
1093240	1094240	With class.
1094240	1096140	I vet class.
1096140	1097140	I'm not a stripper.
1097140	1098140	I'm a dancer.
1098140	1099140	All right.
1099140	1100140	Tiger clothes?
1100140	1103140	If you're dancing at Cheetah, that is not.
1103140	1108860	Tigerclaw in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, would love to see games like Super Street
1108860	1111920	Fighter IV or Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom at the Olympics.
1111920	1113500	Those fighting games are super competitive.
1113500	1116140	So some, some disagree with what we're saying.
1116140	1117560	Now here, here's what I agree with.
1117560	1121640	This is the one, this is, this was the statement I agree with 110%, which is why the video
1121640	1123020	games aren't going to be in the Olympics.
1123020	1124400	Fifth dream.
1124400	1129600	If video games would be in the Olympics, then so should chess, checkers, and card games.
1129600	1133140	Video games will not be at the Olympics for the same reason chess is not in the Olympics.
1133140	1139700	And for all practical purposes, chess is like the closest thing you're ever going to get.
1139700	1140700	Right?
1140700	1142260	But the problem is chess isn't physical.
1142260	1143260	Well, you can do chess.
1143260	1144260	I play it.
1144260	1145260	Bitch table.
1145260	1151840	I used to be on the chess team, flipping a mote icon.
1151840	1152840	Chess boxing.
1152840	1153840	They do it.
1153840	1155760	That actually is something that people actually do.
1155760	1156760	Is that like beatboxing?
1156760	1161100	Well, it's something they like to play some chess and then they box and then go back and
1161100	1162100	do some more chess.
1162100	1170180	It's like the biathlon for, I don't even know what that would be.
1170180	1171780	Chess and boxing.
1171780	1176260	Sophisticated and not sophisticated gaming.
1176260	1177260	I don't know.
1177260	1179420	Uh, black Wolf says full contact chess.
1179420	1181900	Act Def says extreme chess.
1181900	1184700	I'm going to take that time clock and shove it up your ass.
1184700	1189540	What about, what about, um, there was an old Saturday night live sketch from like the seventies
1189540	1196120	with the guy coaching the chess team and it was all Ponderock for Ponderock for, no, really
1196120	1197120	funny.
1197120	1203300	What about like, uh, I don't know, um, some sort of like CG or something like that.
1203300	1207260	You know, let's just start taking stuff from like American gladiators or something, you
1207260	1211700	know, where we have like, you know, a lot of, you know, they have, you know, fucking
1211700	1215940	siren and zap and you know, nitro.
1215940	1217820	Those were my Olympians back in the day.
1217820	1218820	Okay.
1218820	1219820	Those, that here we go.
1219820	1220820	It was the shit.
1220820	1221820	Here we go.
1221820	1225340	The Olympics I think should stay to mostly traditional sports.
1225340	1227060	Curling should not be an Olympic sport.
1227060	1228060	Sorry.
1228060	1230420	However, get out.
1230420	1232380	Curling is like the only thing I'll watch.
1232380	1236020	It's like professional cleaning as an Olympic sport.
1236020	1237900	My mother would love curling.
1237900	1239640	It is exactly what she does.
1239640	1242660	The puck travels down and you follow in front of it with a broom.
1242660	1244540	It's like air hockey on the large scale.
1244540	1247300	Why don't we have Olympic air hockey?
1247300	1249700	Curling was that I would vote for Olympic air hockey.
1249700	1250700	Okay.
1250700	1257940	No, but anyway, my point is keep, keep the Olympics to the traditional definition of
1257940	1259020	a sport.
1259020	1260020	If I can leave it at that.
1260020	1262620	I mean, I'm sure we don't have, is cricket an Olympic sport?
1262620	1263620	No, I don't think so.
1263620	1267540	You have to have a certain amount of countries that would send a team.
1267540	1270980	And I think it's why American football is not a sport.
1270980	1275140	Thank God anyway.
1275140	1279820	But I think that, you know, going back to stuff like the X games and all the alternative
1279820	1284080	sport things, I think they need to stay in their own kind of venue for the people who
1284080	1289260	are more willing to watch that sort of, of activity and make pole dancing part of the
1289260	1290660	gymnastics section.
1290660	1291660	What about wire skiing?
1291660	1293500	Don't they have like water skiing or something like that?
1293500	1294500	Cause I don't think so.
1294500	1295900	I mean, I don't know what you could do with it.
1295900	1298700	You have like rowing, there are events on the water.
1298700	1301700	There used to be, I think water ski jumps back in.
1301700	1304860	Are you saying water sports is an Olympic competition?
1304860	1310180	I think back in the day, but like I said, tug of war used to be an Olympic sport.
1310180	1312660	Solo synchronized swimming, Rob.
1312660	1315500	Solo synchronized swimming was an Olympic sport.
1315500	1316780	You're going to synchronize to, I guess.
1316780	1320700	I guess it's synchronizing to the music, but you know, I agree with Ron, but anything goes
1320700	1321700	rhythm gymnastics.
1321700	1325660	Now look, I will move on from this topic cause clearly we believe it or not.
1325660	1329700	We all in studio, we all chat may feel a little different, but in studio, we all agree.
1329700	1330700	He totally man.
1330700	1335460	If somebody, if I could be a rich eccentric person, I would like make up some sort of
1335460	1336460	event.
1336460	1340780	It's like the Olympics, but not quite, it'd be like kind of a carnival Olympics type thing.
1340780	1344060	Um, so you know, you have all the diving competitions, but they wouldn't dive.
1344060	1346700	They dive into a ball bin, you know, like a giant ball.
1346700	1351220	You just want to put on the pomp and circumstance gown and get up there in front of everybody.
1351220	1353320	May the odds be ever in your favor.
1353320	1356540	Not even, you know, you want to be the queen of England of these games.
1356540	1357540	Fuck that.
1357540	1358540	I want to be the guy.
1358540	1359540	She has diarrhea the whole time.
1359540	1364140	It's a goddamn chairman of the iron chef in Japan.
1364140	1365140	Fuck this American.
1365140	1369060	Someone needs to give old Liz a suppository, but actually, you know what else?
1369060	1370500	Her heart for that James Bond thing.
1370500	1371500	I know, right?
1371500	1372500	You know what else used to be a sport?
1372500	1377640	What distance diving as in who could dive the longest distance before having to come
1377640	1378640	up for Eric's.
1378640	1384620	I like Stan and chat a hundred meters streaking here, somebody in London participated in all
1384620	1385620	right.
1385620	1389020	Takashi's castle, American or a Ninja warrior.
1389020	1393980	There's those are two perfectly acceptable events in my, my guess.
1393980	1396580	We got to move on from this topic and actually get to video games, but I do want to say I
1396580	1400900	love the comment and I'm sorry, I forgot who said it cause it scrolled on by long ago.
1400900	1404100	What about a separate competition for video games?
1404100	1406420	Where is the true video game Olympics?
1406420	1411420	Could we ever see a video game Olympics in our day or I mean, is it kind of already here
1411420	1412420	with e-sports?
1412420	1420380	They have the MLG garbage views and opinions expressed on this program do not necessarily
1420380	1421380	reflect those.
1421380	1428460	Well, I just don't like, I don't like the whole MLG as like a, I don't know.
1428460	1429460	It's a little weird.
1429460	1431220	I I'm, I'm cool with MLG.
1431220	1435300	I don't have a beef with them, but they like, I want something with the pomp and circumstance
1435300	1436300	of the Olympics.
1436300	1440660	I do want Queen Elizabeth out there going, you know, you know, scowling at everything
1440660	1442500	and judging other countries.
1442500	1443500	I want that.
1443500	1447180	I've decided that this country is the best.
1447180	1448180	Fuck all of you.
1448180	1449180	Fuck off.
1449180	1450180	Fuck off.
1450180	1455660	Like even if she won't show up, get, get, um, um, who are the two that just got married?
1455660	1458580	I'm such an ignorant American right now.
1458580	1463740	What Kate and Kate and William get Kate and William out there if nothing else, you know,
1463740	1465860	cause video games are a younger generation.
1465860	1466860	You know what?
1466860	1473140	How I always remember them because the little boy in witches, his mice were Kate and William.
1473140	1474140	You have issues.
1474140	1475140	Or were they William and Mary?
1475140	1476820	I think they were Kate and, anyway.
1476820	1478060	What about disc wars?
1478060	1479740	Why don't we have disc wars?
1479740	1481360	Disc golf should be an official sport.
1481360	1484860	You smoke a lot of pot and then try to hit the bowl.
1484860	1487940	Tiger Claw in our chat room says they have the world cyber games.
1487940	1488940	Okay.
1488940	1492540	I have to, I have to quote act deaf here because I have to do the voice from the queen.
1492540	1493940	Bunch of wankers.
1493940	1495500	All right, look, look.
1495500	1496500	We got to move on.
1496500	1497500	I haven't even done like announcements.
1497500	1499660	We have a huge show coming up after orange.
1499660	1501820	I should do the whole show in a rotten accent.
1501820	1503580	No, you shouldn't.
1503580	1508780	Somewhere peeker Uno and queen voice somewhere peeker Uno and sill and other British listeners
1508780	1513700	of this program are like crying at our accents because I sound like what's his face from
1513700	1517700	Monty Python when I do it.
1517700	1522740	Every time you talk in a British accent, God throws a crumpet at a kid.
1522740	1523740	It feels my cat.
1523740	1524740	She wouldn't move.
1524740	1525740	All right.
1525740	1528540	She'd be like, what the hell?
1528540	1529540	Moving on.
1529540	1533580	Um, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.
1533580	1535180	Dark soccer says that I should.
1535180	1536180	We'll start with you.
1536180	1537180	Dark soccer.
1537180	1538180	What do you been playing this week?
1538180	1539620	I've been playing lots of mass effect.
1539620	1541380	No, I'm not going to do it.
1541380	1547500	I played a crap set of mass effect and then, um, and being laid off, I had, um, pity day
1547500	1552060	where I did nothing but look at Garris fan art, read bad fan fiction, read some good
1552060	1559420	fan fiction, played more mass effect, and we did a raid and wow, we actually raided.
1559420	1560420	It happened.
1560420	1563860	And then I had to go to bed early because of work that I don't have any more dammit.
1563860	1566620	I could have finished the raid.
1566620	1568580	That's the thing that sucks most in retrospect.
1568580	1570340	I could have finished that damn raid.
1570340	1577900	I could have stayed for the whole damn thing, but no, um, and uh, Dan and I decided to watch
1577900	1579660	some game play throughs on some stuff.
1579660	1582700	I mean, he's, we've got the CDX hooked up.
1582700	1589100	I'm so tempted to, um, play through, uh, crap, what the fuck game is that?
1589100	1592420	Um, put in Robo a lust and play through that again.
1592420	1594300	Cause it's one of my favorite shooters.
1594300	1596340	It's awesome game.
1596340	1599820	We did watch several play throughs of full motion video games.
1599820	1607100	We watched, um, dragon's lair and, um, space ace all the way through.
1607100	1608940	I haven't watched space ace in a very long time.
1608940	1610740	I should check that out.
1610740	1612660	Space ace is a good game.
1612660	1620020	Um, and then we were also watching a, did you know about, um, uh, star Fox today.
1620020	1625540	And there's actually, if you use a game genie code, um, for the Nintendo 64, uh, ocarina
1625540	1631940	of time, you can pull in an arwing as a, an enemy that you can target.
1631940	1637260	And basically whatever that big red snake was in the game was, um, its movement patterns
1637260	1639740	were based off of the arwing, huh?
1639740	1644100	So that's why they had the arwing in there as an animation placeholder for when they
1644100	1645740	finished the full model.
1645740	1651260	So you can actually shoot an arwing, just saying kind of cool.
1651260	1652980	Anything else for your gaming week?
1652980	1654580	Um, pizza.
1654580	1658340	All right, let's go to, let's go to Bradley.
1658340	1659940	We'll let our guests go next.
1659940	1662380	Bradley, what kind of stuff you've been playing in the past week or so?
1662380	1665980	The main thing I've been playing is Assassin's Creed that has been sitting up on my shelf
1665980	1668540	for a long time, said, no, I was going to play that.
1668540	1673380	And that's one of, one of two series I get the most emails about why aren't you playing
1673380	1674380	this series?
1674380	1677020	And the other is Borderlands, which I finally did start playing.
1677020	1679900	So that's, I got to get into that at some point.
1679900	1682900	Some people kind of get bored with it just cause at least the first one is cause there's
1682900	1685700	a lot of things you have to do over, do a lot of several times.
1685700	1691220	Like if the climb all these towers and T to the top and then there's got a lot of things
1691220	1694100	that sounded repetitive, but I was, I'm fine with that.
1694100	1699860	And cause a lot of the big stuff and the acting is pretty good and, and, and actually getting
1699860	1703540	up above the city and, and looking down, it's kind of fun.
1703540	1704540	Like your Batman?
1704540	1705540	Kind of.
1705540	1706540	Yeah.
1706540	1709820	And it's kind of fun just to murder guards left and right.
1709820	1713860	Just to, you're supposed to be sneaking around, but just kind of let them come at you cause
1713860	1718300	they're mostly easy to beat and then just have a whole fields of places just of the
1718300	1722420	dead guards sitting there and actually made one place easier because you're supposed to
1722420	1727780	beat up this guy who's who's like speaking to the people, trying to get them to do something.
1727780	1732020	And usually there's like a bunch of people there and you have to wait for him to get
1732020	1733460	to a secluded area.
1733460	1737580	But I killed all the guards that were there and then just then just once you activate
1737580	1740940	that thing, you just beat him up right where he started.
1740940	1744420	So it makes it make that little thing a little bit easier to do.
1744420	1747500	Now are you playing these games to kind of set up for the third one that's coming out
1747500	1749820	that's getting a lot of hype?
1749820	1752620	And I'm not really worried about that at the moment just cause I don't have loads of time
1752620	1753620	to play.
1753620	1758060	I might probably get to two sometime, but just something I wanted to clear from my backlog
1758060	1763180	cause I have hundreds of games on the backlog.
1763180	1768440	Another game played was Tetris Axis, which is more Tetris and that's various different
1768440	1769440	Tetris modes.
1769440	1776420	Just the bad thing about it is that they don't let you use the circle pad to control.
1776420	1779940	Also played Mole Mania, just the first level of that.
1779940	1787340	It's a classic sort of game, game that's on the 3DS and cause it's a classic hard puzzle
1787340	1788340	game sort of thing.
1788340	1790260	I just played the first part of that.
1790260	1796220	And then also the other game I got to play was Rhythm Thief, which is a pretty good game.
1796220	1799820	So far I've gone through the first two chapters and all the rhythm games so far have been
1799820	1800820	distinct.
1800820	1806380	Yeah, I was going to say, I played the demo of that on 3DS and I thought it was cool,
1806380	1808660	like, everything seemed to be kind of different.
1808660	1809660	I like that.
1809660	1810660	Yeah.
1810660	1815540	It's very, it kind of was a throwback a little bit to me, like, to Space Channel 5.
1815540	1820380	But like, yeah, I mean, kind of like that zaniness off the wall uniqueness, but kind
1820380	1822260	of like a different play style, which was cool.
1822260	1824380	Yeah, it was pretty cool.
1824380	1826020	And yeah, it's been good so far.
1826020	1834940	And the one silly thing about it is that the dog that follows them around is called Fondue.
1834940	1839140	And they have all these opportunities to make cheese jokes, and they do.
1839140	1841140	Oh, lord.
1841140	1842140	That's cool.
1842140	1844380	That's definitely an old school Sega title right there, I think.
1844380	1845380	Yeah.
1845380	1846380	And that's about everything.
1846380	1847900	And also I've played a little bit of Spelunky.
1847900	1851900	I've been playing that the last few weeks and still haven't beaten the game and I've
1851900	1852900	died about 800 times.
1852900	1858980	And it's one of those games that you get, I get really frustrated at, at certain times,
1858980	1862740	just dying left and right, saying, oh, fuck you, fuck you.
1862740	1866700	I heard the soundtrack's really good to that because I saw something about the soundtrack
1866700	1867700	is out.
1867700	1870340	It's a pay what you want thing, but as long as you pay at least $7.
1870340	1871780	Yeah, it's pretty good.
1871780	1878740	I think I've heard that the XBLA version is different from the original, like the PC version.
1878740	1880260	So I think people might like the PC version.
1880260	1881900	That might be from the PC version.
1881900	1886180	And I think people like the PC version better, but I haven't heard the PC, I haven't tried
1886180	1888340	that one yet though on the PC.
1888340	1889340	All right.
1889340	1894260	Uh, well, if that's it, um, before I go to Loki, cause Loki I know has a big week we
1894260	1895260	got to get into.
1895260	1897140	I'm going to go next cause mine's actually really quick.
1897140	1901220	Um, as far as new games go, there's really only one new game I got, I got to try this
1901220	1902220	week.
1902220	1903220	Played a lot of the same old stuff.
1903220	1906220	You know, I played a world of Warcraft, played some aspect multiplayer and all that good
1906220	1907220	stuff.
1907220	1910260	One new game I tried over the weekend because it's having a free weekend is a new MMO called
1910260	1911940	the secret world.
1911940	1918660	Um, it's kind of, it's an MMO obviously, and it's set a little more in the modern day world.
1918660	1923460	It's more of a modern day MMO with kind of, you know, the whole like zombie element to
1923460	1924460	it.
1924460	1928940	And you know, kind of a cyberpunk kind of a twist on it.
1928940	1930180	Um, so it's kind of cool.
1930180	1934580	It's one of the first MMOs I've played in a very long time where I didn't sit there
1934580	1936260	going, Oh, this is a lot like, wow.
1936260	1940260	Or, Oh, I'm looking for the wow influence or, Oh, I see that they took this from wow.
1940260	1943360	And keep in mind, I, I'm usually kind of have that eye because I have been playing world
1943360	1946180	of Warcraft for so long and you don't have the podcast and everything.
1946180	1950260	That's how I approach a lot of games or MMOs, but I'm secret world really didn't remind
1950260	1951260	me of wow at all.
1951260	1956100	The combat was really fast paced, which, you know, another friend of mine was playing it
1956100	1959340	and it kind of irritated him, but I kind of liked the combat.
1959340	1963540	I also liked that these, there was no leveling yet.
1963540	1967500	There was this skill wheel that kind of took the place and you could combine your skills
1967500	1969220	in very interesting ways.
1969220	1973740	Like the chick I was playing could use magic, like elemental magic, but she also wielded
1973740	1979460	a sword because she's kind of like, you know, Beatrix kiddo from kill bill, except with
1979460	1980740	magic and a sword.
1980740	1982240	That's kind of how I imagined her.
1982240	1987820	So I mean, that was kind of like fun to play and, and the different environment is a lead
1987820	1991580	leads way to a different set of quests and all that and a different type of story.
1991580	1996380	And yeah, I got to say, I was feeling it, but I'm going to tell you what I'm not feeling
1996380	2000800	with the price because if I want to play beyond this weekend, I'm going to have to pay $50
2000800	2001800	for the game.
2001800	2005380	I'm going to have to pay $14.99 a month, you know, that's now granted that standard for
2005380	2006380	a lot of MMOs.
2006380	2009060	Sword tour was the same when it first came out.
2009060	2014820	But what I don't like is that they're selling on top of that, all these like ammo packs
2014820	2017220	and you know, things to get like, no joke.
2017220	2022420	I saw something on the website that was, I want to say it was like $129 worth of in game
2022420	2023420	items and stuff.
2023420	2027440	And I'm just like, hold on you guys for such a new thing, you guys are nickel and diamond
2027440	2028440	way too much.
2028440	2032660	So I get to do the free to play and the subscription thing, which I understand.
2032660	2033660	Yes.
2033660	2035500	World of Warcraft sells those mounts and those pets.
2035500	2040100	I've never bought one that wasn't for charity, but those things also don't give you an edge
2040100	2041140	in the game.
2041140	2043540	And I was a little put off by that.
2043540	2047740	And honestly, I think it's, it's happening to every other MMOs we're going to get into
2047740	2048740	later this week.
2048740	2052180	I think it's just a matter of time before secret world goes free to play or gets a price
2052180	2053180	reduction.
2053180	2054180	So you know what?
2054180	2055220	I'm just going to wait till then.
2055220	2060180	I did enjoy what I played of it, but if it's going to go the way of every other MMO, sorry.
2060180	2064100	I know that that might give me some stink eye from developers and things like that,
2064100	2069660	but I just, I don't, I didn't love it enough to just jump on board and support it.
2069660	2071500	That's that's where I was with it.
2071500	2076020	And SGA 100 Mountain chat says, yeah, but Rob does, doesn't, didn't Blizzard sell useless
2076020	2077020	mounts.
2077020	2078020	Correct.
2078020	2079020	They do.
2079020	2080020	And I don't like it.
2080020	2081020	I got to admit, I don't like that they do that.
2081020	2082260	I think it's an, I don't buy those mounts.
2082260	2084420	I think 25 bucks or whatever they charge for a mount.
2084420	2086700	I think it's ridiculous.
2086700	2092340	However, once in a while Blizzard will put out a $10 pet where it all goes to charity
2092340	2093580	or something like that.
2093580	2094580	I'm okay with that.
2094580	2095740	That's a lot different.
2095740	2101340	So those I have bought, but I've never bought a mount for the 25 or whatever.
2101340	2103220	I just think that's a little silly.
2103220	2107100	And I also think they charge way too much for the server transfers and wow has other
2107100	2108580	pricing issues too.
2108580	2112620	The cost to enter the game right now between buying the Battle Chest, Wrath of the Lich
2112620	2116560	King, Cataclysm, and soon Pandaria, it's, it's, it's ridiculous.
2116560	2120820	And that's why wow is losing subscribers, but I'll get into that a little later in the
2120820	2121820	show.
2121820	2122820	For now.
2122820	2123820	That's it for my gaming week.
2123820	2125620	Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki.
2125620	2126620	All right.
2126620	2132180	So I read Twitter and I listened to this show.
2132180	2136460	So I know you took the day off work on Wednesday, right?
2136460	2137460	Yes.
2137460	2141440	So you could stay up Tuesday night because the third gate was opening in that ready player
2141440	2145300	one competition that you've been talking about for weeks and weeks and weeks.
2145300	2146300	Yeah.
2146300	2150460	So take us back to Tuesday night and that evening, walk us through your evening, the
2150460	2153700	anticipation and the, uh, what happened next.
2153700	2157820	So I was sitting on my computer, you know, waiting, counting down the minutes and stuff
2157820	2161140	like that for the ready player one contest, the next gate to open.
2161140	2165900	Cause it was the next video game challenge and you know, a bunch of people that were
2165900	2172780	kind of in the competition, we're all just, you know, waiting for it to open and, um,
2172780	2174020	so finally keep refreshing it.
2174020	2180140	It's like a couple minutes before, uh, nine o'clock Pacific, which, you know, is a midnight
2180140	2184740	East coast and it actually opened the couple minutes early.
2184740	2191180	So immediately I was greeted with, you know, the next page and they're talking about how,
2191180	2194980	you know, how, you know, the third gate contest.
2194980	2200300	And basically, you know, here it was so ready player one Easter egg hunt, the third gate
2200300	2206180	to complete the third challenge in the RP one Easter egg contest, you must, and this
2206180	2212180	is where I was like, what you must set a new world record high score on one of the following
2212180	2222860	classic video games, robotron 2084 joust black tiger and tempest.
2222860	2229140	Now since then they've added joust on the Atari 2,600 and Pac-Man, but all the rest
2229140	2231180	are arcade versions.
2231180	2238180	So basically nobody was going to, it was, it was a waste of time to, you know, even
2238180	2241420	bother staying up because obviously it's not something that you're going to be able to
2241420	2242420	do right away.
2242420	2247460	Um, it says, uh, of course the record setting, the record setting game must be played on
2247460	2252300	the original game hardware, meaning that you have to play an original coin operated arcade
2252300	2256740	game, or in the case of joust, which this is all added later because he's literally
2256740	2264740	tweaked the rules for this contest about 12 times before, since I'm reading it now, um,
2264740	2268220	you must follow, anyways, uh, no emulators are allowed.
2268220	2272220	You can practice on any of these games with an emulator, but when you set the world record
2272220	2274900	it must be done on the original game hardware.
2274900	2278400	And then of course it goes into a little bit of detail what you need to do.
2278400	2281640	Basically this is tied in with twin galaxies, you have to follow their submission rules
2281640	2287620	and stuff, and I haven't really played around with twin galaxies that much because I kind
2287620	2294100	of roll my eyes every time I hear about twin galaxies, but, um, their submissions are ridiculous.
2294100	2298380	Basically you have to, so here's the challenge.
2298380	2303580	Number one, pick a game that you're going to somehow get the world record to.
2303580	2308380	Well actually even before that, find an arcade.
2308380	2311440	Number two, find an arcade that has classic games, because classic games don't bring
2311440	2315860	in money to arcades anymore so they don't have them anymore.
2315860	2321180	Number three, find an arcade with a classic game that happens to be nearby because, you
2321180	2326340	know, there's not a lot of them, that's also willing to allow you to stay there for long
2326340	2331620	hours and open up their arcade machine and film the inside of the arcade machine as well
2331620	2336700	as you playing the game without any sort of interruptions from little kids or something,
2336700	2340900	you know, jumping in the way, knocking over your camera equipment, all that other stuff.
2340900	2347940	And that's even before you're able to even beat the high score, because this is not like
2347940	2352380	a high score on an arcade machine, this is breaking a world record, you know, we're talking
2352380	2357840	about like the King of Kong stuff, Chasing Ghosts, I mean they make documentaries about
2357840	2362860	this about people that have these games in the garage and they play them for hours and
2362860	2364780	hours and hours a day.
2364780	2369780	Loki if you want, I know a film crew.
2369780	2376420	I mean, it's just, here's my disappointment, I understand that, you know, he's basically
2376420	2382340	saying okay, well this is the type of competition stuff that was in Ready Player One, the boat,
2382340	2384580	okay, let's back up for a second.
2384580	2390700	Okay, the first gate was an Atari 2600 game, an original Atari 2600 game they made specifically
2390700	2391700	for this gate.
2391700	2396700	That was cool, because it tied in with the game and it was challenging but it wasn't
2396700	2400220	like, oh my god this is impossible to beat.
2400220	2404300	Number two, and granted these are all supposed to be increasing in challenge each time, number
2404300	2406620	two was not a challenge at all, it was a Facebook game.
2406620	2411780	The only challenge was my patience in playing a Facebook game that was basically pay-to-win.
2411780	2415140	I want to point something out though, between that first and second gate, that first gate
2415140	2419660	you have the classic, you have the old, you have the history of video games right there.
2419660	2423140	I mean, granted it's not like Space War or something like that, but for all practical
2423140	2426800	purposes the Atari 2600 is about as far back as most of our gaming memories go.
2426800	2431020	And then for the second gate you had the most modern thing, I mean love it or hate it, Facebook
2431020	2432900	is gaming right now for a lot of people.
2432900	2439020	The only reason that it was tied in with it because it was Richard Garriott, the guy
2439020	2444180	that was behind Ultima, a pretty classic series.
2444180	2449660	Granted I would have thought the Ultima MMO that they're beta testing or something like
2449660	2454180	that would have been a better fit for this, but you know, whatever, Facebook game where
2454180	2457600	you collect vintage stuff, fine.
2457600	2458600	But it was annoying.
2458600	2459600	Okay.
2459600	2460600	It wasn't difficult though.
2460600	2465440	There was absolutely no skill involved in it at all other than click click click, alright
2465440	2468700	crap I ran out of energy, gotta wait for more energy.
2468700	2471780	Click click click, oh crap, oh I don't want to wait anymore I'm gonna pay for more energy.
2471780	2474340	I mean that's really the only skill that was involved there.
2474340	2478700	To, oh hey by the way you gotta set a fucking world record, I mean that's a little like
2478700	2482300	woof, like what the hell kind of a difficulty curve is that?
2482300	2484300	I mean that's a little ridiculous.
2484300	2489620	Now let, to be fair you know like I said this sort of kind of ties in with you know the
2489620	2494420	book and you know how well you know the main character in the book he played a perfect
2494420	2501100	game of Pac-Man and stuff like that and you know oh cool you know, but you have to understand
2501100	2507740	in the book these people were, this guy leaves his fortune of billions of dollars, billions
2507740	2513180	of dollars and these people have to find these easter eggs to get this vast amount of fortune
2513180	2516860	so they become experts in everything 80s.
2516860	2521000	Including playing arcade games for like all of their free time and we're talking like
2521000	2525620	just people just playing games and the reason that that main character goes in the first
2525620	2530940	place to this like kind of an arcade museum and plays that Pac-Man machine because he
2530940	2535260	likes playing Pac-Man it's not because oh shit I gotta play this Pac-Man machine perfectly
2535260	2539260	so I can get this you know whatever to open another gate and it didn't even have anything
2539260	2545180	to do with the other gate but it's just because he enjoys playing these games but now forcing
2545180	2550020	people to play these arcade games in the world record you're not targeting your audience
2550020	2555620	of people that enjoy 80s stuff and read your book and like the book you're targeting people
2555620	2559100	that play arcade games hardcore and that's it.
2559100	2564740	Alright let me, since it's only a three hour show Loki, let me throw some tough questions
2564740	2566100	at you.
2566100	2569220	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetware.com.
2569220	2572220	The guy apparently doesn't want to make it easy for someone to get his car.
2572220	2573740	You knew it wasn't going to be easy.
2573740	2575980	I didn't think it was going to be easy but I thought it was going to be a little bit
2575980	2581580	more original like you know let's get the guy that created you know fucking I want to
2581580	2585580	be the guy to create some new custom game that ties in with the series and it's fucking
2585580	2589120	hard I don't mind that that would have been fair because it would have been something
2589120	2592700	unique that oh this is challenging but I just have to be skilled enough to do it.
2592700	2597300	The thing that you know I gotta say it this may surprise you I actually agree with you
2597300	2601820	to some extent that this is a little bit silly because it's one of those things that looks
2601820	2606020	good on paper like oh yeah we're gonna have the contest end all contest but if you really
2606020	2612220	think about it you're right the way to get to the way you're gonna beat this is is not
2612220	2615900	something everybody can accomplish it's kind of an uneven playing field I'm not even talking
2615900	2620420	about gaming skill I'm just talking about access to these games because yeah to find
2620420	2625780	an original machine there's only so many arcades in the nation that even have something like
2625780	2629920	that and if you're like you might be the most hardcore gaming fan in the world and you live
2629920	2635280	in Montana you're fucked there's necessarily there I mean I don't know of any big classic
2635280	2640220	gaming arcades in Montana excuse me if I'm wrong but you're gonna have to find an independent
2640220	2644980	game collector you're gonna have to be like John Jay rental from video game outsiders
2644980	2649660	who has the arcade in his basement you gotta know something about necessarily there's any
2649660	2656420	of those places will rent out classic games to pizza parlors to mom-and-pop places okay
2656420	2663420	to go ahead so just restaurants in general you know skating rinks my the skating rink
2663420	2669380	I went to in Dothan Alabama since I was a little kid had the same damn Frogger there
2669380	2675340	even when I went as an adult the same Frogger I played since it was brand fucking new just
2675340	2681540	saying you can find them okay I'm not saying it's impossible but it's not it's not like
2681540	2685980	you know hey any of these challenges where it's okay here's the here's the ROM or here's
2685980	2690260	the the game that you can play in a flash you know in the browser and everybody has
2690260	2697180	access to it this is like okay find arcade game and play it and you know he keeps at
2697180	2702620	like I said he keeps adding more stuff to this and he's he's supposed to be adding more
2702620	2709700	more games each week but that's the thing too that I also don't like these rules keep
2709700	2714140	getting fucking tweaked every time and beyond that and that's what shows me it wasn't thought
2714140	2717580	out because they're having to consistently tweak the rules because they're realizing
2717580	2722100	oh fuck that we did make this impossible here's here's my other question for you it seems
2722100	2725740	like there's some good sportsmanship and camaraderie amongst all the people who've gone far in
2725740	2728580	this competition right like you guys are all talking to each other and stuff there's some
2728580	2733900	people yeah sort of like what's been the reaction overall like is everybody pissed like you
2733900	2738740	or are there some people that are like all right now this is a contest there are some
2738740	2743900	people that are kind of like kiss asses like that that's my opinion at least that are like
2743900	2748620	well I think this is I think this is a perfect contest blah blah blah blah blah but like
2748620	2752900	you know I'll read some examples like one of the posts or whatever on planet ludus which
2752900	2758940	is one of the websites that's kind of dedicated to all this stuff and I laughed when I saw
2758940	2764300	it because it was is basically the thread topic was you've got to be kidding me and
2764300	2769980	then you know the post seriously and then you know the next ones well nobody's gonna
2769980	2773820	beat it tonight haha man I live in it I live in the country it's gonna be tough finding
2773820	2781900	an actual working arcade I bet collector has these arcades are gonna be bombarded and what
2781900	2787300	is it so just in case any further proof you won't win the DeLorean I'm serious I don't
2787300	2791500	I'm thinking no one is going to win unless someone's already working on world record
2791500	2795240	happens to hear about this cause that's the other thing too one of these world record
2795240	2800260	holders you know hears about this contest because obviously it's on the internet you
2800260	2804540	know what to say they're not gonna go oh hey you know I'm just gonna do these play these
2804540	2808260	really fucking easy games and cool I got a DeLorean now we're gonna see Billy Mitchell
2808260	2812380	with a DeLorean end of story I think that's exactly what's gonna end up happening I think
2812380	2816260	one of the existing record holders is gonna get wind of this if they haven't already and
2816260	2819760	it's just gonna motivate them to break their existing record and it's that guy that plays
2819760	2824380	with his feet though that'd be awesome but see that's that's fucking lame and here's
2824380	2829300	the other thing too is they've also at like I said they keep adding and changing the rules
2829300	2836420	they put anything now well if the third gates not completed by October 1st you know check
2836420	2843020	back to this page we may have a fourth gate or we may just end the contest it's just like
2843020	2848140	really I mean you're gonna do this crap here's the problem though and I'm trying to make
2848140	2852140	this short but here's the problem I'm torn because I don't want to quit I don't want
2852140	2858660	to quit now but at the same time I don't want to invest in the stuff that I need to in order
2858660	2864620	to complete it like for example I have an arcade machine at home it's just a main cabinet
2864620	2869100	but it's an arcade machine I popped that computer out of there it's a jamma cabinet I could
2869100	2875540	pop any jamma game in there I wanted to play black tiger there was a whole bunch of you
2875540	2880460	know drama behind that too because everyone there's a conspiracy that the black tiger
2880460	2886940	machine that the guy used to complete the world record was somehow not necessarily modified
2886940	2891780	in you know maybe he didn't know it was modified but that it was a hybrid machine meaning it
2891780	2895180	had some of the chips from black tiger and had some of the chips from black dragon which
2895180	2899340	is the Japanese version of the game and the Japanese version scores differently than the
2899340	2906100	US version which may have caused that of course they you know twin galaxies approved it and
2906100	2912420	said no it's legit but I mean they're doing that off a video and you know if it's not
2912420	2915980	legit are they really gonna go back and go oh we made a mistake I don't think so I don't
2915980	2920100	think that they're going to at this point but there's claim it's still legit he even
2920100	2924220	Ernie Klein actually posted something in his blog about it saying oh it's legit and stuff
2924220	2928060	oh and here's the other thing to tell you how out of touch you know I think he is with
2928060	2933100	his fans he does own like a black tiger machine I think he actually has a few arcade cabinets
2933100	2937500	cool that you're into arcade where does he live I have no fucking clue yeah I understand
2937500	2945260	go play it in his house but you know I'm actually I'm thinking about buying a black tiger arcade
2945260	2952220	board my god but I see the thing is though is I don't want to black tiger though like
2952220	2956680	I said the high score on it is million are being such a boy right now you are being such
2956680	2961900	a boy right now where you do not want to give up on this you are just I know I'm not gonna
2961900	2968260	stop and ask for directions I'm gonna beat this damn it and then you're gonna get cut
2968260	2971580	off at the knees by one of these guys that already holds the world record and you're
2971580	2976140	gonna be three times as pissed as you are tonight I know I've known you for ten plus
2976140	2980780	years that's exactly what's gonna happen hey I understand that that's possible oh yeah
2980780	2984380	and then of course the Pac-Man world record you have to beat the the time so we're already
2984380	2988980	50 minutes in I gotta bring this to a close but I have to ask this okay and we have a
2988980	2993200	show following us tonight so we can't have a marathon show tonight but I gotta ask this
2993200	2998540	Twitter drama cuz I gotta say Loki you were a little bit ranny pants on Twitter and you
2998540	3003780	went so far to say say fuck you Ernie Klein which did strike me as a little bit angry
3003780	3010740	12 year old but okay you're mad whatever what's going on on Twitter you get angry and he follows
3010740	3018820	you I guess yeah but you know what I I've I've tweeted him before because he had posted
3018820	3024960	or he did a video talking about his DeLorean that he's given up and you know he misquoted
3024960	3030580	himself like he's oh yeah it's got 249,000 miles on him like well how many fucking miles
3030580	3035340	did you put on that thing it was only had 29,000 miles before oh that's the other thing
3035340	3040100	too the DeLorean is only like 25 grand that's what he bought it for off eBay he's put 6,000
3040100	3045380	miles on it right now yeah the contest rules say oh it's worth $25,000 dude you've put
3045380	3050540	fucking 6,000 miles on it in like a few months chatter here's the thing and Bobby and Chad
3050540	3055200	is saying is the Black Tiger arcade board cheaper than a tricked-out DeLorean you guys
3055200	3060900	don't understand Loki it doesn't matter at this point because now it's a thing it's become
3060900	3064780	a thing and now it doesn't matter anymore folks it doesn't matter if the value of that
3064780	3077660	board is greater it it's a thing am I right Loki it's a thing I just want to win it's
3077660	3083980	exactly it personally I would want to try robotron but finding a Williams machine is
3083980	3091460	like near impossible all right so other things that played Minecraft I played Call of Duty
3091460	3096860	and oh I did play Black Tiger a little bit because I got that's what I did that night
3096860	3100480	when I got pissed off I'm like fuck this shit I'm just gonna boot up my cabinet and play
3100480	3104220	Black Tiger a little bit because I haven't I haven't really played that and that's the
3104220	3107020	other thing too it's like if you're gonna create this world record it's I think a lot
3107020	3110300	of these people to do it don't just say I just want to hold the world record this it's
3110300	3115940	they enjoy playing that game I don't enjoy playing Black Tiger but I don't know we'll
3115940	3119460	see what they add I don't know there's not really I don't think all of them are gonna
3119460	3122500	be breaking world records so I don't think anyone's gonna do it and to be honest he said
3122500	3127060	so far he's has four because one of the first things you have to do is you take a picture
3127060	3130540	of the machine that you're gonna attempt the thing on and you send them also you know the
3130540	3135860	gear pictures they took for the first two gates he's had there's almost 1,200 people
3135860	3141980	have passed the first gate 725 that have passed the second gate five that have emailed him
3141980	3146560	a picture for the third gate so far that even say they're attempting game guru says just
3146560	3152020	buy the damn DeLorean nope I'm sorry buddy it's a thing that's what you're missing it's
3152020	3158380	not about the DeLorean anymore that's the problem it's a manual DeLore it's a manual
3158380	3165260	car that sucks can't even drive a manual I can't drive a manual it sucks gas and it can
3165260	3175460	only be repaired in Southern California so but you still want it yes that's got to be
3175460	3183540	the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life it is him it is you are by one you are happy
3183540	3188340	you'll spend less money no no no I won't dark soccer you don't how long have you known this
3188340	3192500	man that's not gonna get it that's not the answer no one's gonna win it cuz they're gonna

3528200	3533600	it's not about that it's about the in-depth and I mean in-depth television critiques that
3533600	3536900	they do every week and they're very mindful about spoilers they're very good about all
3536900	3541000	of that so check it out I don't even know what they have planned apparently there's
3541000	3545000	a special guest coming on for the 200th episode that's gonna be awesome that starts tomorrow
3545000	3549220	night at vog network Monday 4 o'clock Pacific 7 o'clock Eastern congrats you guys on your
3549220	3555380	200th episode even if Jamie would like to question your font choices you know what congratulations
3555380	3562820	to them it's just papyrus is like it's nails on a chart cocaine all right it's fine you
3562820	3566800	know it may look pretty but it's really bad for you I'm gonna make an orange launch radio
3566800	3571780	logo and comic sans and see how that goes do that and I will judge you forever all right
3571780	3582020	gaming news geez Loki so Star Wars the older Republic's going free-to-play well it'll transition
3582020	3586740	to a hybrid free-to-play that's what they're calling it basically they're gonna allow a
3586740	3591180	major portion of the game to be free including the first 50 levels in all eight classes of
3591180	3597380	course there's gonna be restrictions and microtransactions to go with that if you do subscribe to the
3597380	3602580	game you will be given a currency each month called cartel coins you can buy customized
3602580	3610820	gear and other items also you'll get other special rewards if you're a different subscriber
3610820	3617340	then they you know they basically said that they want to give people flexibility so you
3617340	3623580	know you want to do a subscription you can do that otherwise you know you can you know
3623580	3631820	not and of course apparently the numbers have been dipping a little bit the people are actually
3631820	3636720	subscribed to it they've sold two million copies however right now there's only less
3636720	3643540	than a million people actually playing so that's not very good there's tons of tons
3643540	3647180	of people playing for it who aren't paying for it or are they doing that whole free isn't
3647180	3652220	already free to play to play in for it whatever free to play to level 15 or 20 so yeah it's
3652220	3660980	like a yes bullet 20 I know that is either 10 or 15 but I think free to play will definitely
3660980	3668900	help their numbers so that's kind of cool I mean I just think that a lot of people maybe
3668900	3674540	didn't like the game and so they just stopped playing it's not necessarily this effect well
3674540	3679660	it's a really good single-player game I don't think there was enough cutting-edge content
3679660	3686020	for the multiplayer was the problem and for me PvP ran really sluggish and I have a pretty
3686020	3691620	high-end computer so it made it a lot less fun to play I liked a lot of ideas in the
3691620	3698340	game and the storytelling was done really well but I just think I think it was a game
3698340	3702660	that had about three months worth of content that that's about how long it lasted unfortunately
3702660	3708340	you know it's a tough it's a tough highly competitive marketplace right now and the
3708340	3712880	I think people give too much credit to the fact that it's Star Wars it doesn't matter
3712880	3717260	folks that's what gets that's what will draw people in for that first taste that and the
3717260	3720660	fact that it's Bioware and that Knights of the Old Republic has a good history behind
3720660	3724180	it that's what draws people in but it ain't gonna make people stay and I think people
3724180	3730540	to put way too much stock into this just because it's Star Wars it's not like everything Star
3730540	3738540	Wars related has always been golden cough cough Christmas special cough cough prequels
3738540	3747780	right true I mean yes Star Wars is a great movie the original Disney the trilogy online
3747780	3752400	game all right I just want to piggyback on this real quick for going the next story did
3752400	3756340	you hear about World of Warcraft because yeah not like things are all roses over there either
3756340	3763460	their numbers are dropping to their numbers drop to 9.1 million as reported at the expectations
3763460	3768580	this week well for a game that had 12 million subscribers that is supposedly at the you
3768580	3775460	know is the pinnacle shining MMO a 25% loss which is what that essentially equates to
3775460	3780260	gradually over the past year that is something that makes investors go oh really the game
3780260	3785460	is kind of until pandaria then the biggest problem with World of Warcraft and I've said
3785460	3790220	this until I am blue in the face on a horde house and Blizzard Activision pulled your
3790220	3794380	head out of your ass on this I swear to God this is what's holding the game back and I
3794380	3802300	don't know why they can't see it the cost to enter the game is too big every other game
3802300	3808360	consolidates the expansions into the original game at some point Warcraft has done it once
3808360	3813500	with what's going on a fifth expansion that's unacceptable it's not working I realize they
3813500	3818160	put the expansions on sale once in a great while I'm sorry if that sale is not sitting
3818160	3823500	on the target shelf you're not going to draw in new players it is time for them to consolidate
3823500	3828500	Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm into the original battle chest sell it for $19.99
3828500	3834260	or you will never get more subscribers so what happens if you don't have those expansions
3834260	3839720	do you just not get the play you play it's a level 65 you played a 70 70 70 with because
3839720	3844060	burning crusade is included now they finally do when I started burning crusade wasn't well
3844060	3848660	when I went back right crusade was no that was more of a reason I bought them all but
3848660	3852820	I mean it sucks that you had to do that and I you know it takes a special kind of crazy
3852820	3859420	to do that however I found places that sold everything for less than retail not much less
3859420	3865100	than retail but less than retail right I love you fries but still I mean you know if they
3865100	3870220	really want to attract new subscribers $19.99 for the game but for some reason there were
3870220	3874700	sell $19.99 for the base game and then charge for the missus pandaria expansion or whatever
3874700	3878980	but you know the reason why it's not working is people want to play with their friends
3878980	3882580	and they have this whole recruit a friend program that'll get you to level 80 real quick
3882580	3888780	you can't get to level 80 without buying at least the first expansion hello there's a
3888780	3894300	total logic fail going on here and they need to fix it so uh rage nator in our chat room
3894300	3898980	at live dot vog network dot com says well nine million plus subscribers is still respectable
3898980	3904360	it is that's why this isn't quite the doom and gloom I mean show me another mmo that's
3904360	3909240	anywhere close to that that's not called lineage let me rephrase show me one in the states
3909240	3916580	that's anywhere near close to that level of hysteria that world of warcraft is um panaxium
3916580	3920720	in our chat room says I was going to play with a friend he saw all he had to buy we
3920720	3929480	played something else my point exactly exactly well here's what I did I mean I and you you
3929480	3934420	know this I had already had burning crusade like early on because I did play it back in
3934420	3939780	the day but I played all the way up until I hit level 70 and then that night I went
3939780	3945980	out and got uh wrath of the lich king and all you were doing with these expansions was
3945980	3951300	paying to level you don't even I mean that's what blizzard doesn't get nobody is running
3951300	3957220	the old raids anymore hello except us well because we're doing them because they're fun
3957220	3961540	it's a little different and you're doing them with over leveled characters which is really
3961540	3970860	fun because I like you know overkill but I mean you know I I did my I actually got one
3970860	3977020	to 85 pretty much by myself except for saying hey rob help me kill this guy well it's nice
3977020	3981140	that you can solo so much of the content you know yeah there is a lot of it that you can
3981140	3985580	solo and you can go in and go back and do other quests low level quests and get more
3985580	3989220	of the story which is what I was doing for the longest time all right I don't want to
3989220	3992260	turn this into the warcraft podcast but I will close with this comment from our chat
3992260	3997740	room live.vognetwork.com I wouldn't want to compete with horde house sj100 matt says blizzard
3997740	4002500	needs a rude awakening I think Diablo 3 was the start but they won't change their tactics
4002500	4007900	without getting hit in the pocket books I agree with you with 90% of that statement
4007900	4013020	that I would change the word blizzard to Activision and now I agree with that statement think
4013020	4021380	about it everything started going downhill when think about it all right moving on with
4021380	4025100	other gaming news hopefully this won't be downhill for Nintendo because that could be
4025100	4031140	bad Nintendo needs the Wii U to be successful this holiday season and we may have some of
4031140	4038460	the details thanks to an apparent GameStop leak I don't see here's the thing I'm reporting
4038460	4044020	this I don't write the news you know I'm reporting this bringing it up for discussion because
4044020	4048940	it's circulating all the blogs out there I kind of don't think this is news personally
4048940	4055200	but I want your thought I mean here's the deal GameStop apparently got marketing materials
4055200	4059860	for the Wii U to talk about what games are going to come out win and it outlines all
4059860	4064900	of the different publishers and when the games are coming out and for example the first party
4064900	4071320	stuff from Nintendo Lego City Undercover holiday new Super Mario Brothers you holiday Ninja
4071320	4078260	Gaiden three razors edge holiday Nintendo land holiday sing holiday Wii U panorama view
4078260	4084740	I don't know about that one holiday game and Wario launch window Pikmin 3 launch window
4084740	4091380	project P 100 launch window and Wii Fit U launch window what's that tell us not a lot
4091380	4095100	it doesn't tell us dates it doesn't tell us which of those games will be available on
4095100	4099680	the actual day and which ones are closer to December 25th but I mean it's not like there's
4099680	4104540	going to be that much time between the time this system releases and you know Christmas
4104540	4111100	anyway so and I kind of was like I thought we already knew if you listen to the way they
4111100	4117220	delivered that keynote I thought we already knew Pikmin 3 will be out the same day as
4117220	4123340	the Wii U we know that Wii Fit U I think we had a good feeling was going to hit that same
4123340	4128820	day too and we kind of knew Super Mario Brothers U where what Wii Fit U where yeah that's what
4128820	4132980	it's called and new Super Mario Brothers U was coming out after that I believe Reggie
4132980	4140060	said all that the only surprise of this whole thing Nintendo Land is marked holiday the
4140060	4143800	only that's the only thing that surprised me because I think Nintendo Land I thought
4143800	4148740	was going to be like a pack-in game you want to hear something funny all right what that
4148740	4159180	list that list was released on June 6th during E3 by Nintendo so these things have changed
4159180	4165420	and yet oh no that list is exactly what they they released that there is no news here this
4165420	4171300	is all stuff that you know they've already these are all the announced titles so but
4171300	4177140	yet everybody's GameStop just leaked the entire Wii U lineup no they didn't because Nintendo
4177140	4183060	already leaked their fucking lineup a long time ago I can link I can link everybody to
4183060	4189780	the wonderful you know because I knew I recognized that list and yep it's exact August August
4189780	4197760	2nd all over the interwebs check that out yep only only I shouldn't say only in this
4197760	4202180	industry because this shit happens all the time but only in this industry can two month
4202180	4210860	old news be made news all over again right well let me go back and tell you about things
4210860	4217800	that aren't on the list because you know that's always fun since you know we we you know let's
4217800	4221540	get you while you're in a mood tonight I'm just saying you know we talked about this
4221540	4226260	a few weeks and here's the other thing too like there's some publishers that aren't on
4226260	4230900	here like Disney Interactive because there's certain times they haven't announced yet that
4230900	4236780	our Wii U titles that are coming but they haven't officially announced it yet was that
4236780	4242880	because they're 2013 at this point no that's that's that's how we know when we that's how
4242880	4249060	I think I know record Ralph's gonna be Wii U isn't it nope no epic make you do is oh
4249060	4253340	yeah yeah I remember that and then of course you know also this list is not accurate too
4253340	4259700	because they you know they just talked about Madden 13 and also FIFA 13 are gonna be launched
4259700	4264980	titles that are gonna be on the Wii U so like this is all this right here I can tell you
4264980	4272420	right now just looking at it if I were to guess I would say that this is a merchandising
4272420	4280080	manual from Nintendo you know some people that may be privy to the kind of stuff like
4280080	4284580	that but that would be my guess where this leak came from because I think that they deliver
4284580	4289260	this stuff to these stores that kind of informs them of the lineup and what kind of stuff
4289260	4293080	that they can look forward to and they also give them bullet points to talk to with their
4293080	4299100	customers about that stuff it's basically to inform the people that work there about
4299100	4302780	the titles that are coming out and stuff all things Nintendo because if you look at this
4302780	4307780	they have Nintendo DSI product information Nintendo DS product information tend to 3ds
4307780	4315420	product information connectivity and policies warnings and disclaimers so it's it's from
4315420	4320940	Nintendo but it's just the stuff that was all the announced titles from e3 act-def in
4320940	4325380	our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says the internet has really low memory spans ain't
4325380	4332300	that the truth but hey it's cool that you know certain websites can uh can run with
4332300	4337020	it because you know hey GameStop posted it must be legit alright let's move on with some
4337020	4343540	more news Dark Sakura hey I have some news guess what what it's about stuff we already
4343540	4347740	know about but you know what I'm gonna talk about it because it's fucking hilarious okay
4347740	4354380	EA is suing Zinga bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep um so yeah they um filed a lawsuit against
4354380	4361220	Zinga saying that the Ville is a blatant ripoff of The Sims Social and it was filed on August
4361220	4367180	3rd 2012 saying that they willfully and intentionally quote copied and misappropriated the original
4367180	4370940	and distinctive expressive elements of The Sims Social in the violation of US copyright
4370940	4378180	laws and basically it's like you know I'm gonna paraphrase as I understand it Zinga's
4378180	4382580	gotten away with a lot of shit and a bunch of against a bunch of people who really can't
4382580	4391260	pay to go against them we've got money let's do it bitches
4391260	4400280	this is the plaintiff EA claims that the defendant willfully and rootfully copied all of the
4400280	4409120	assets from their popular game The Sims Social they're suing for $4,000 this is a quote that's
4409120	4415220	by the EA Maxis label manager Lucy Bradshaw this is a case of principle Maxis isn't the
4415220	4419260	first studio to claim that Zinga copied its creative product but we are the studio that
4419260	4423860	has the financial and corporate resources to stand up and do something about it infringing
4423860	4428020	on a developer's copyright is not an acceptable practice in game development by calling Zinga
4428020	4432580	out on this illegal practice in other words calling them on their shit we we hope to have
4432580	4436660	a secondary effect of protecting the rights of other creative studios who don't have the
4436660	4442900	resources to protect themselves you know what I think it's fucking hilarious I think that
4442900	4448440	even if there is a you know an offer of a settlement I don't think that EA should take
4448440	4452900	it I think they should nail their asses to the fucking wall this is so fucking weird
4452900	4458980	what's happening with this like for real think about it suddenly we're all team EA which
4458980	4463180	weren't they just named the most evil company in America thanks to the internet not that
4463180	4466620	long ago yet suddenly here we are we're all team EA we're just trying to redeem themselves
4466620	4474260	okay and like EA hold on hold on this is where it gets better EA is championing for the little
4474260	4481020	guy they're sticking up for nimble bit and all these other game the bingo blitz creators
4481020	4489740	and all this what the fuck here's my thing on it first of all I mean at least they're
4489740	4502780	not chick-fil-a so they're not serving up Mass Effect with a side of hate you know I
4502780	4507740	was hoping we could go all night without that coming up but if it had to come up all right
4507740	4513420	all right okay anyway back to the original point okay they've done things that we disagree
4513420	4519920	with but overall they put out quality products right you know you're nodding so if everyone
4519920	4526500	can hear the rattling and Rob said then you'll know he's nodding um Rob Rob you're kind of
4526500	4534540	bobblehead II tonight so anyway so anyway you can I don't I'm not saying that we're
4534540	4541060	completely team EA and I honestly do look at part of this as a PR stunt you know here's
4541060	4545860	our perfect opportunity Zinga has been taking all this money here's our opportunity to put
4545860	4550340	them down and get some good PR out of the deal and you know what if I was running a
4550340	4557020	company I'd do the same shit I'd be like hey opportunity let's knock on the door but this
4557020	4563340	is something that honestly a lot of good will come from as long as they stay pretty you
4563340	4569820	know steady in their pursuit and nails Zinga to the wall I think they have to keep going
4569820	4576660	until it's completely just until they're torn apart and then maybe nimble bit will get some
4576660	4586220	money the end the end sorry I mean I wanted to go back real quick to talk about that last
4586220	4590580	story we were talking about I completely forgot about Activision that was another thing that
4590580	4595860	is on this list none of the Activision titles are like Skylanders Giants Call of Duty Black
4595860	4602680	Ops 2 Transformers Prime there's a Cabela's expedition all right we get it it was full
4602680	4609580	of crap that story on the internet just one of the have that anyway going back to the
4609580	4615540	current story if you look at the comparisons it really is side by side they took a lot
4615540	4620540	of the material from Sim social well the hilarious part was the one that flip-flopped where the
4620540	4625860	lawyer got the damn screen wrong but I mean when they're I mean there's some pretty damning
4625860	4629180	evidence in there I mean I know this is all allegedly and we're not supposed to talk about
4629180	4633100	it like it's already a done deal but let's be real we're all gamers we've saw through
4633100	4638540	this shit a long time ago yeah and I gotta hand it to the lawyers they're breaking it
4638540	4643780	down the fucking number of pixels in the doorway is the same between the two games when you
4643780	4649900	look at that you're like I the smacketh down has been brought in if you rearrange these
4649900	4654220	items to look or rearrange the furniture in this room to look like the other room you
4654220	4661580	overlap the fridge they're the same fridge yes yeah it's I cannot I'm sitting there with
4661580	4665620	my big tub of popcorn like I want this to play out in the people's court I do I want
4665620	4670660	this to be televised we will Wapner on them I want get Wapner out of retirement seriously
4670660	4677100	reside over you you know that this shit is like it's pretty much okay we want you to
4677100	4685340	take this game and change it enough so we don't get sued in the group look Zinga is
4685340	4693100	really gonna need a moment of how are we going to survive as a company because they're being
4693100	4698380	kicked in the balls left and right right now people are selling their stock but I mean
4698380	4702220	we all we've all talked about we know good people that work for Zinga and I don't want
4702220	4705620	like people to think like just because we think Zinga is evil means all the people that
4705620	4708340	work there evil that's not the case people just do whatever job they have to do to get
4708340	4713820	by but clearly management needs to go another direction and some higher-ups need to get
4713820	4719020	sacked and and it's not to say that they can't pull themselves out of this because let's
4719020	4723660	look at another company that was kind of and it's still kind of famous of ripping off other
4723660	4730180	companies Gameloft Gameloft does a lot of like hey that looks awfully little close to
4730180	4735060	Halo or hey that looks just like Call of Duty but you know what they're not they aren't
4735060	4740380	literally I mean it's ripping off of a genre I guess or like a type of game but they're
4740380	4744940	actually good games that's the weird thing although they aren't news so I might argue
4744940	4751540	that Dungeon Master Online is actually better than Diablo 3 so I'm just saying at least
4751540	4756200	one of those games can be played offline you know if they can focus on making good games
4756200	4761540	because they are capable of making games it's just come up with your own fucking ideas for
4761540	4765260	once and there's a lot of independent guys out there I mean you know you bought some
4765260	4769460	of them because maybe you couldn't figure out how to copy their game without it going
4769460	4775460	without people going huh or maybe you know maybe if they didn't agree to you know sell
4775460	4780180	you their you know IP or game or something that you were just gonna you know come up
4780180	4784040	with Drawville or something like that but all right let's move on we're running long
4784040	4789180	tonight so let's pick up the pace a little bit Loki all right so let's talk a little
4789180	4796540	bit about the UK they've adopted the Peggy rating system hooray hooray for uniformity
4796540	4801460	already duplicating it weren't they they were double ratings they were doing something but
4801460	4807380	yes now the UK officially uses the Peggy system for rating its video games and it's dropped
4807380	4811620	the I guess they have the British Board of Film Classification ratings guide now I remember
4811620	4817420	seeing those and of course you know because of this they've you know removed the dual
4817420	4824020	classification system and then also now UK retailer workers can face prosecution for
4824020	4830620	selling games with a Peggy rating of you know higher than the customer obviously at 12 16
4830620	4836480	or 18 to underage customers with math maximum sentence of six years wow that's that's pretty
4836480	4845900	uh it's pretty ridiculous six years for selling a game to a minor especially like a teen game
4845900	4852540	that just seems a little harsh well I think it's more just trying to well see you know
4852540	4855860	what my problem is with the rating systems is that it's discouraging parents from doing
4855860	4861700	their damn job end of story you know I think that the ratings are there to should be there
4861700	4869340	to inform the parent and then the parent should do their damn job yeah so this is kind of
4869340	4873740	like that California law come to life like right isn't this the whole thing that the
4873740	4877700	Supreme Court overturned not that long ago is now happening and am I reading this right
4877700	4883500	or am I misunderstanding well yes and no but see their thing was it wasn't like tied
4883500	4890060	to I don't know if it was tied to the M rated stuff but I don't know if that law I don't
4890060	4895620	know UK laws too well if they do something similar to like the movies movies that are
4895620	4901500	rated you know by the BBFC if it's like you know mature something and you sell it to a
4901500	4906220	minor if they get the same type of infraction because if they're gonna put that in place
4906220	4912100	on games I think it should be uniform across all platforms of media if you're gonna do
4912100	4916740	something that drastic I think it's still kind of drastic but you know if that's the
4916740	4923020	route they're gonna go as long as it's equal across you know across all the different media
4923020	4932100	platforms and okay I guess it'll be interesting to see how this pans out what possible future
4932100	4937740	legal challenges await yes yeah that's what always inevitably ends up happening is legal
4937740	4943740	challenges fun fun I don't know anybody who will sue over this unless they somehow get
4943740	4951060	roped into playing this without you know agreeing to be a willing participant in this and this
4951060	4955180	is a case of some kids with a lot of free time on their hands not that that's bad it's
4955180	4961580	just the interesting things that are created it's a Sega Genesis modification it's called
4961580	4968060	gene zap it has a motto no leave it would be Jen's that Jen's that it's g g e n e gene
4968060	4973460	Jen's app would you be Jenny's up Jenny's app Genesis well look at Jen okay Jenny's
4973460	4979200	app I'll go with that Jenny's app no pity for bad players what is it it's a dog shock
4979200	4987260	collar that will zap you whoever's wearing it when they screw up or take damage in certain
4987260	4993580	Genesis games that have been modded oh I guess they do say it's Genesis so it's Jenna's app
4993580	5000900	not jeans at my bed look like Jean the jingo their jeans may be zapped by I was created
5000900	5006660	by two French guys and they modded it for games like Sonic the Hedgehog Golden Axe three
5006660	5014500	mega Bomberman and so forth when your character takes damage damage in game you get zapped
5014500	5019460	let's see apparently there's a video that goes with it where let's see it says go to
5019460	5024780	four minutes 10 seconds in where Sonic falls into a spike pit and there will be a stream
5024780	5029660	of bleeped out French cursing oh that sounds good to me let's fast forward to that part
5029660	5037360	in the video let's go to four minutes it's in French but you can hear Sonic in the background
5037360	5055860	here we go I'm glad to see that the kids in other countries are just as dumb as the ones
5055860	5063580	here doesn't make me feel so bad that's really what it boils down to isn't it you know it's
5063580	5068540	only gonna be a matter of like days before they're like hey I'll put this on your nuts
5068540	5074060	because because you know if there isn't a video that has to do with you know somebody
5074060	5079840	shocking myself penis time to penis how long before the Jenna's app is on his Wang it probably
5079840	5086500	already happened it's just not on YouTube because frisbee in our chat room says ah lay
5086500	5096660	fuck clover Nikon says sounds like an add-on for jackass the game you know it's really
5096660	5102100	weird that like I kept getting shocked when I was playing the Bomberman act zero but for
5102100	5107940	summer it felt like I was getting kicked in the balls repeatedly but it's just when I
5107940	5114140	thought about the $60 I spent on Bomberman act zero all right one more story from dark
5114140	5120580	soccer and then the release date star soccer well how about some good news for e3 they've
5120580	5125940	confirmed they're staying in Los Angeles until 2015 basically like bitches this is our town
5125940	5133340	you're not building shit yeah cuz the city was gonna tear down what was it the South
5133340	5140740	Hall or think West West Hall and and build like a Coliseum or some shit but instead they're
5140740	5145100	like they're gonna build a stadium for a football team they don't have yet yeah like I said
5145100	5152860	we're building it on the roof or something shit so but yeah basically they're saying
5152860	5159220	that they've generated 40 million dollars for Los Angeles in three days when they do
5159220	5164060	the show so they're basically bringing in enough revenue that the city can't really
5164060	5170660	afford to fuck with them so it's going to be there for another three years three more
5170660	5182220	years yay three more years I ran to the kitchen but I've come in and I'm still I seem to remember
5182220	5186620	something else about the story about how they've also worked out that the nearby vendors will
5186620	5191580	no longer jack up their prices during the week of e3 and here's my big question does
5191580	5199060	that include parking it should we have to park the last time that's right that one time
5199060	5203900	we went we took oh my gosh we parked like literally like it was at least five blocks
5203900	5208520	away at least ten blocks away but it was relatively cheap parking I think we only paid five bucks
5208520	5213140	to park whereas if you park across the street the convention center it's like 50 it's crazy
5213140	5219360	times but anyway um I think basically what ended up happening here is that LA was like
5219360	5224300	please don't leave you do so much for the economy you're going to help build this damn
5224300	5230880	arena please don't leave we'll do anything just stay because the year that e4 all happened
5230880	5236740	and you know LA lost that money it it was it was a little kick in the butt yeah it was
5236740	5241700	they learned and one could argue they may be building that new stadium to bid for I've
5241700	5246820	heard rumors LA is supposed to be bidding for another Olympic Games that's a mistake
5246820	5253260	that ends up putting such an economic cripple on the town that um hosts it it depends if
5253260	5259680	you look historically when LA did it it actually didn't I don't know how I'm sure Bobby could
5259680	5265060	answer how it worked for Atlanta but I think like when LA did it it was fine it was actually
5265060	5271140	so was plunged into debt mm-hmm Beijing was plunged into debt almost anywhere that's hosted
5271140	5275220	it has been plunged into debt afterwards with just the fallout from what's going on afterwards
5275220	5279880	but it's the Olympics and not to mention that they have to kick out residents to build whatever
5279880	5283320	facilities are there the one in Greece still wasn't finished while the games were going
5283320	5291060	on same Bobby clarifies Atlanta didn't lose money at all in the games all right but it
5291060	5297580	was commercialized all to hell yeah when I went to Vancouver in 2006 the Olympic Games
5297580	5301700	were being shoved down my throat not that it's a bad thing Olympics are fun especially
5301700	5307020	I prefer the Winter Olympics personally but anyway let's not talk about things that are
5307020	5310580	gonna be happening in the year 2020 let's talk about next week and video games that
5310580	5315860	are coming out to your nearby stores we'll start with the u.s. Loki well I hope you like
5315860	5320080	games that feature persona characters fighting each other because that's all that's coming
5320080	5325260	out this week persona for arena on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 remember it's not region
5325260	5332460	free not region free yeah we talked a couple weeks ago that's a good thing for the u.s.
5332460	5336820	that's a good thing for Japan it's not a good thing speaking of Japan let's talk about their
5336820	5342380	release dates if that's all Loki's got on the Xbox 360 this week sniper elite v2 comes
5342380	5347420	out from 505 games and that's the only release on August the 9th going to the PlayStation
5347420	5352660	3 that's it to sniper elite v2 so I guess it's kind of a similar story in Japan this
5352660	5358580	week going to the handhelds though wow there's nothing on the 3ds that kind of surprises
5358580	5363940	me there ain't anything listed until the 23rd on the 3ds what a slow period holidays going
5363940	5368740	on I don't know let me look at the Vita real quick see if there's anything big there there's
5368740	5375240	a couple games there there's ginsai shogi kaiutendo Tofu Rajin comes out this week as
5375240	5379880	well as Orgar rhythm comes out I wonder if that's the same thing as the sound shapes
5379880	5382900	game that's coming out here on the feet isn't that this week by the way you might have missed
5382900	5386340	that I think sound shapes is out this week I think that's probably that's a digital on
5386340	5391180	there really oh that could be it is no this title actually looks a little different this
5391180	5396100	is it's actually not a rhythm game even though that's in the or maybe it is it is it looks
5396100	5400140	sound shapes is it looks like Peekman to me this you know this game this Orgar rhythm
5400140	5405620	looks like a it's an action game they're calling it yeah hit a button when the queue falls
5405620	5409340	hmm interesting yeah it is kind of a music game but it looks like music infused with
5409340	5415820	Pikmin kind of looks interesting that's it oh Akuma JP in the chat room next week is
5415820	5421380	Obon holiday I hope I said that right which one Obon oh yeah I thought there was a holiday
5421380	5426060	coming up around this time of year so gotcha I mean it could just be for the holiday could
5426060	5433060	be so in the UK there's a few releases on the 7th is Unmechanical on the 8th is Hero
5433060	5441100	Academy and Hybrid and that's it but a few things a few a few just a few a bit a bit
5441100	5446140	a few more stories and then the classic game of the week is coming at you but first Loki
5446140	5454300	all right so Minecraft there's some interesting things with that first starting off 1.31 update
5454300	5461820	has come out and what you can get with that of course now they've merged single players
5461820	5468860	and multiplayer on so they have a unified mode and then also they've added a few things
5468860	5479380	including a chest for the ender chest as well as writable books and you can trade now they've
5479380	5490020	added trip wires which sounds awesome large biomes world type also some cocoa beans to
5490020	5499460	the jungles emeralds and emerald blocks and emerald ore I guess a bonus chest option which
5499460	5504540	allows people to have like some stuff starting off so you spawn with the chest with like
5504540	5514100	a few basic tools nearby which is kind of cool also let's see just some some other bug
5514100	5522020	fixes like mobs being able to clip through walls stuff like that so that's kind of cool
5522020	5527940	and then to go along with that minecon 2012 has been announced and it's going to be going
5527940	5536620	to Disneyland Paris in November so I don't mind con Disneyland Paris November 24th and
5536620	5547700	25th I found something for you in Japan town by the way okay a Minecraft mask a big foam
5547700	5556820	mask of the dude Steve I guess or a game that creeper mask too and the axe the pickaxe awesome
5556820	5561460	all right well I doubt you found any memorabilia for this game because it's several years old
5561460	5569040	but it's coming back do you remember imagine 1994 and remember Wolfenstein 3d well there
5569040	5575260	was a game that came out not long after Wolfenstein 3d called rise of the triad rise of the triad
5575260	5580860	is coming back y'all it's coming on unreal engine 3 apogee software announced this at
5580860	5586100	quake con over the weekend this was in rumor status earlier in the week but literally earlier
5586100	5592460	today it was confirmed in a trailer is out right now the developers interceptor software
5592460	5598380	and the original rise of the triad level designer joe siegler is one of the members pretty awesome
5598380	5603640	single player of course online multiplayer and a level editor it looks pretty awesome
5603640	5609420	via steamworks you'll be able to share stuff yeah sounds pretty cool so all of the crazy
5609420	5617700	weapons and and dog mode so this is look definitely for the fans the gameplay and it looked pretty
5617700	5621580	awesome because I wasn't really a fan of rise of the triad I mean I played it a few times
5621580	5626500	a shareware game but it looks pretty cool because it's kind of like a hybrid between
5626500	5634980	like you know like a wolfenstein or Duke Nukem but fast like like the unreal games unreal
5634980	5640660	term and stuff so it looked kind of cool like a lot of the fast gameplay and just you know
5640660	5644660	with that kind of setting I could dig that a lot of folks in our chat room are getting
5644660	5651020	excited DDR dollar bill yeah I'm a bit disappointed that there's not a console version it's only
5651020	5656860	PC right now if they're doing all the steamworks and all that I can see it I mean I realized
5656860	5664240	PlayStation was supposed to do the steam integration but only one game has done it so all right
5664240	5669040	well let's go back to a time maybe perhaps even before 1994 actually I have no idea when
5669040	5674500	this games weeks game came out but dark soccer will clarify for that clarify that for us
5674500	5678860	right now it's a little older than that a little older newer sorry a little newer all
5678860	5682620	right every week dark soccer likes to jump into the classic gaming vault and find a classic
5682620	5689220	video game that she thinks hey you little brats play this game or suffer my wrath dark
5689220	5697060	soccer what is the classic game of the week don't patch which is awesome and very hard
5697060	5706140	don't patchy is one of the actually play the screen play the opening screen because I can
5706140	5709580	never say it quite right I love the way the guy says it oh my bad hold on yeah and then
5709580	5728700	after that you can fast forward okay if that little voiceovers yeah just cuz I can never
5728700	5734420	say it like that don't punch you know anyway um it's made by cave and published by Atlas
5734420	5741860	in 1995 yes for anyone who knows the term cave shooter this pretty much started it um
5741860	5746780	it was the first game that was developed by cave in the second on their first generation
5746780	5754100	arcade hardware the first was power instinct 2 the title means leader B but it's also an
5754100	5761540	onomatopoeia as in the sound of firing guns so it is like I said one of the first bullet
5761540	5771540	hell games so basically you play as a pilot whose mission is to just survive an 8 years
5771540	5778260	long training mission so that you can become one of the don't patchy squadron so basically
5778260	5783780	you have you're progressing through their training period so you have two modes of fire
5783780	5788900	you have a shot fire one but holding it down you have a concentrated vertical beam but
5788900	5794420	it slows down your ship like a whole freaking lot you have three different kinds of aircraft
5794420	5799380	you have type a which is the red one that has a narrow stream of shots type b which
5799380	5805380	is green um that's a helicopter that has main guns forward and then side guns that rotate
5805380	5809300	um 90 degrees from forward when you're moving horizontally and then type c which is the
5809300	5814420	blue or black one um that has a wide three-way spread shot which honestly type c is my favorite
5814420	5818900	just saying you've got your regular shots where you just tap the button to fire and
5818900	5821940	then you if you hold your shoot button you have your laser and then you have a spread
5821940	5829620	bomb if you hit the bomb button um you also have um a laser bomb that if you press your
5829620	5836500	bomb while you're holding the laser then it does a lot more damage but it's narrower so
5836500	5841940	you've got five different areas and you can loop them um if you complete them the second
5841940	5847860	loop has the same areas um the same patterns but it's a denser bullet so basically it really
5847860	5852740	does turn into the bullet hell and if you get the final boss in the second loop you
5852740	5859780	have a secret area where you meet the big boss of the game the hutchy which is a b
5861140	5865860	um so basically it's other than that though it's pretty much a shooter you can get your
5865860	5872420	power increases you can get your bomb increases and mp um you can pick it up after you've
5872420	5880260	continued so it returns all of your powers to full strength um basically you know it scores
5880260	5887780	um you get more additional points for uh for your bombs uh you get um depending on how
5887780	5892980	many bombs you have left you have you know however many for uh different items that you've
5892980	5898100	collected and then if you complete the second loop on one credit you get a million points
5898100	5903140	for um however many fighters you have left in your inventory you know your leftovers
5903140	5908980	so that's pretty much it i mean this was the game that started the whole bullet hell
5910340	5917780	uh series of games and it did have a sequel doh don't watch which um is out on um iphone
5917780	5923460	you can play it on the iphone but this but it probably sucks let's be real well i don't know
5923460	5932020	espa gabagabaluta which i can never say right um did uh did perform very well i actually plan on
5932020	5935380	buying the doh don't patchy resolution uh revolution wasn't it called or
5935380	5940500	resurrection or whatever the crap um the game uh don't patchy is out on saturn and it is a
5940500	5946020	game that's on my list to buy awesome freaking game all right there it is your classic game
5946020	5948020	of the week don't punch don't punch
5950260	5954740	bullet hell vertical you're not even getting into the bullet hell part of it this is still
5954740	5959700	like this this looks easy yeah it's i can make it through the first two levels of don't patchy
5959700	5963220	no problem forward later in the video here see what happens yeah there you're getting a little
5963220	5967700	bit more into the bullet hell there you go but the second playthrough uh-uh no i can't do it
5968580	5972660	and i i ended up i end up getting like kind of dizzy playing bullet hill games see that
5972660	5978420	that's where you get into it nice yeah all right i know zether is a fan of the uh bullet hell
5978420	5982740	shooters he said this one is one of his favorites it's one of my favorite games too zether also
5982740	5988500	clarifies the doh don't patchy iphone ports are of the newer games resurrection and die flukatsu
5989140	5996500	okay so but um i i am not good at bullet hell games i'm just gonna go and say this
5997060	6001060	but i love them and i like she doesn't dodge bullets she shoots them
6001060	6006180	well that's kind of why i like ikoruga because you can um absorb the ones that makes it a little
6006180	6012180	bit easier to get through the mass but i freaking played the crap out of um espaluta on my phone
6012180	6017300	so just saying all right there it is your classic game of the week we're gonna take a break kids
6017300	6021780	don't go anywhere when we come back rapid fire news the frugal question of the week your calls
6021780	6028020	your emails and some more news including a steam decision that may prove to be not too popular but
6028020	6033060	seems to be popular with a lot of game makers and game publishers right now we'll be back after a
6033060	6043860	quick break with more of orange lounge radio don't go anywhere welcome back everybody to orange
6043860	6050660	lounge radio episode 468 in progress august the 5th of 2012 live at the voice of geeks network
6050660	6054980	vog network.com all right loki what was this you were bringing up during the break just you were
6054980	6061540	gonna tell it on air anyway so go ahead i was gonna send the ernie ernest klein um and message
6061540	6070340	on twitter because basically um you know the world record for black tiger is only possible
6070340	6079140	on this machine at um what do they call it it's a fun spot it's the one that the world record was
6079140	6083620	accomplished that's the huge that's the huge classic game arcade yeah that's one of the movies
6083620	6089780	and all that shit the huge arcade um their people have already beat it on the actual machine it's
6089780	6095700	just they haven't been verified by twin galaxies um but the reason why they're able to beat it and
6095700	6101380	even the guy one of the guys that um posted it he's all it's because the last dragon gives you
6101380	6108740	one million points versus what black tiger does he's like right here and the guy um says the board
6108740	6113220	at fun spot plays like black dragon which gives out one million for the last dragon actually i
6113220	6117860	think it plays identical to black dragon on the second easiest difficulty it says black tiger
6117860	6122100	and though for sure it's all in english i just figured i'd push it higher at this fun spot
6122100	6130500	this morning i think i scored um 2.7 million that was my highest it's so basically it's impossible
6130500	6137620	to hit that score unless you go to fun spot so fuck that shit is what i gotta say and just because
6137620	6142420	twin galaxies doesn't want to cop up to the fact that oh hey you know we didn't really investigate
6142420	6146580	this board and just because the guy that ref that shit fucking doesn't know anything about black
6146580	6151540	tiger and maybe isn't aware of the fact that you can grind your score up by running through the
6151540	6156500	game really fast and at the end you're you know basically taking out zombies that keep respawning
6156500	6160820	and that's how you get your score up that is well known in the community that plays black tiger even
6160820	6165060	for me who doesn't know anything about black tiger but oh just all of a sudden got into the community
6165060	6170260	about it so that needs to be pointed out so that they can fix this shit because i would like to
6170260	6174260	legitimately have a high score in that game but i can't if the game is fucking modded
6178260	6179460	this is the plaintiff
6181780	6188260	he goes by loki on a podcast that nobody listens to he claims that the defendants a bunch of
6188260	6195060	fucking fucktards who don't know how to run a contest were negligent he's suing for a 12 pack
6195060	6203300	of diet pepsi it's legit the guy that beat the score is a familiar with black tiger and that's
6203300	6209780	how he said it scored so i don't understand why between galaxies can go and claim go investigate
6209780	6215220	it then go go have someone play that game because obviously it's it's someone's very easily able to
6215220	6219780	you know beat that high score have them play the game and watch how it scores or have them you
6219780	6225060	know verify i'm so over this i know i'm just like but yet you guys we don't we don't check the
6225060	6229700	machine but they did it to steve weeby's machine on film so i understand that you guys are over
6229700	6235460	this but you're not over the fucking chick-fil-a shit i'm sorry why no no oh no chick-fil-a show
6235460	6242260	please please don't yes i am over it so let's not go there all right
6242260	6254180	uh i need to filet this episode of orange lounge radio i did see though the best ever take on that
6254180	6260260	for marketing purpose the chick on chick-fil-a it was a double chicken breast all right look
6260260	6265620	we're gonna get into rapid fire news hey bradley how you doing our special guest here in studio
6265620	6270020	in this historic night how you hanging in there i'm all right i apologize for loki's behavior
6270020	6275540	tonight and the constant barrage of references on things we we come to sunday nights at orange
6275540	6280180	launch radio to escape from what are you playing on your 3ds over there playing mole mania right
6280180	6284820	now what mole mania mole mania oh i thought i said mall mania at first i'm like what the
6284820	6293380	hell game is that why are you playing it all right how is it how's the game is that an old
6293380	6297460	school game boy game or like a new 3ds game it's an old school game boy game they set it on a
6297460	6302980	virtual console uh what other virtual console games you own on that thing over there uh i
6302980	6309380	think the only thing i have is dragon crystal which is a game gear game nice and of course
6309380	6315300	the other like ambassador games stuff like that but i have super mario land with the awesome like
6315300	6320500	random ass egyptian theme in the dungeons for no particular reason just that the games i think the
6320500	6324420	games weren't even designed by the same mario team yeah maybe yeah i remember playing that
6324420	6331780	on the original game boy but i never have gotten on the on 3ds all right let's move on and try to
6331780	6338580	tackle some rapid fire news where we're going to tackle the news as quickly as possible logi
6341140	6345060	i'll wait for the mic there um so anyways let's talk a little bit about
6346340	6352900	nba 2k 13 and apparently now i see i don't even know why this is a thing but apparently
6352900	6359140	jz is going to be executive producing the game i don't know if that changes your opinion on whether
6359140	6366660	you should buy that game or not but yeah so he's gonna have i guess he's doing some of the uh
6367780	6373460	picking up the soundtrack maybe um he's got a bunch of his songs in there and uh
6375220	6380020	it looks like a lot of other you know hip-hop artists in there as well you know actually i
6380020	6384580	think it's kind of a clever move like i know some of y'all might be skeptical about it but
6384580	6391940	i it's star power and it's it's a big star with a lot of power and i think for for those two worlds
6391940	6396340	to kind of collide the music world and the gaming world i think there's definitely a lot of people
6396340	6402740	that are gonna they're gonna turn their head a little closer at nba 2k 13 because jz's involvement
6402740	6407940	i mean it's just it's just it's stories like this they're us would we talk about this otherwise
6407940	6413540	probably not it's that whole thing where that's that's probably good for him being props to them
6413540	6418660	for including daft punk around the world that's kind of cool yeah and uh there's a justice song
6418660	6424180	in there um so i think i'm pretty sure i mean jz is married to beyonce for heaven's sake i mean
6424180	6431780	i'm pretty sure he's pretty diverse with his music likes all right so uh next is uh playstation all
6431780	6436580	stars that's going to be getting a public beta this fall of course you know if you're a subscriber
6436580	6441700	to playstation plus you're gonna be able to get into it earlier um but they're gonna start off
6441700	6448820	by sending some codes as well pretty soon um i guess uh they were a little disappointed about
6448820	6455220	all the characters being leaked out uh chan park of superbot entertainment is so that was unexpected
6455220	6464260	and unintended no shit um so yes apparently they're gonna make um some more official character
6464260	6468980	announcements they're probably included in those ones that they've already leaked out uh august 15
6468980	6475700	during uh gamescom and last but not least i'm glad to see there's some marketing going on for
6475700	6483060	grand theft auto 5 uh viral marketing now including a website um for the epsilon program it's kind of
6483060	6488660	a spoof of Scientology and was also referenced in grand theft auto san andreas now the epsilon
6488660	6495380	program website is available and you can check it out um or at least there's a twitter going along
6495380	6506020	with it ebsol ebsolism today this is a twitter account and um yeah the religion i guess is called
6506020	6516900	a kiff mult kiff lom neat yeah epsilonprogram.com you can go check it out and they've got got some
6516900	6523620	stuff there are you getting excited are you getting hyped all this grand theft auto 5 stuff
6523620	6527060	well there's not really much grand theft auto 5 stuff right now in fact that was they had the whole
6527940	6534820	financial um you know uh conferencing that they were um talking about you know all the different
6534820	6539060	games and how they were doing and everything and grand theft auto 5 wasn't even really mentioned
6539060	6544580	too much so it's kind of neat that they're gonna have some stuff i'm hoping that we get some out
6544580	6548900	of gamescom i'd like to see something but i'm guessing that this game's probably not coming
6548900	6556340	until at least you know april of next year stan in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says if
6556340	6559540	anyone gets a beta code for all stars battle royale and you don't want it i'd be happy to
6559540	6568100	take it off your hands uh ratchet tag speculating on the jz nba 2k13 blue ivy will be in it no way
6568100	6574260	jose that baby's gonna be like michael jackson's kids back when they were young like they they had
6574260	6579140	to go out and like wear the face covering so that the media couldn't get pictures that's what will
6579140	6586500	happen all right moving on to some other rapid fire news doom 3 is getting a re-release as we've
6586500	6591460	already talked about before doom 3 bfg edition some news coming out of quake con there is going
6591460	6597700	to be an extra lost mission that will be in the hd remaster don't know what the lost mission entails
6597700	6602900	but not too surprising usually these types of remasters and remakes get some type of extra bonus
6602900	6607940	thing so something that was originally on the cutting room floor makes a lot of sense so it
6607940	6612420	comes out this october if you miss doom 3 the first time around or you want to play it again
6613700	6620500	one game i can't understand why people play again and again but it's like it's like torture and this
6620500	6624100	is the type of game that i would have expected loki would have to beat to win a delorean you
6624100	6631380	ever played q op i've played co-op i am i've been dying to download this because i really want to
6631380	6636900	shoot some pigeons well actually yeah i don't it's it's not q q i call it q op is it all right quap
6637540	6642820	quap has this that's not the game i want to report on tonight although i think that shit's hilarious
6643380	6652900	it's a new game called clop what is clop it's quap but with a unicorn as the star as opposed
6652900	6658180	to an athlete right like the original is like an athlete now if you've never played quap um
6658180	6663220	what god how the hell do you describe it it's like a running simulation but like remember
6663220	6668020	like track and field by konami back in the 80s in the arcade running was simulated by hitting
6668020	6672260	the buttons as fast as you can like right and on the old school nes games and the power pad run
6672260	6680100	as fast as you can q op is actually about like bend the knee bend the ankle and it's four buttons
6680100	6686580	to control it but it's like all like super physics and stuff so now there is clop and it is by the
6686580	6692100	maker of quap and gurp and whatever other games they've come out with clop is a four-legged
6692100	6701700	unicorn uh that you uh use h j k and l to control the unicorn and in this one good luck getting up
6701700	6713380	hills that's the game look you should have had to play i tried playing clop and i kept laughing
6713380	6718660	it was fun and i've never played it but you haven't played clop yeah god i i'm worried where
6718660	6724660	this is going i've never played it okay clop if you um you control each foot of the horse okay
6724660	6732420	and if you happen to use the front feet you unlock lame horse mode where the back feet get broken and
6732420	6738340	you have to crawl with the front this sounds fantastic and there's like this weird justin
6738340	6743700	bieber looking character that keeps making fun of you when you die or not even necessarily die but
6743700	6747860	you're like that's just rude slowly tip over backwards and it's kind of funny that's just
6747860	6752340	rude justin bieber comes out makes fun of you that's like it looks like zach efron or justin
6752340	6757860	bieber i mean it's just it's weird uh ratchet tag in our chat room says unicorns make everything
6757860	6762660	better exactly and that's exactly what this game is all about does it fart rainbows it might
6762660	6769540	they've only won a unicorn that farts rainbows well maybe you can find the rainbow farting special
6769540	6775380	item in the world of warcraft arcade cabinet that is apparently on its way out in china uh there's
6775380	6780500	a china digital entertainment expo going on right now and apparently there is a world of warcraft
6780500	6786580	arcade machine on its way uh league of legends starcraft 2 and some other stuff as well and yeah
6786580	6791540	they show pictures of people playing in an arcade style machine now don't think like i'm not talking
6791540	6796900	like it's a special arcade release of the game but you gotta remember the arcades in asia still very
6796900	6802340	much a thriving community things like cyber cafes and things that never took off here would do much
6802340	6805540	better in these other countries so it's really about the kind of the community and getting
6805540	6809380	together so the fact that they're putting these games in arcade style cabinets really not a
6809380	6814740	surprise at all especially if you look at counter strike neo look at that that's a very pretty
6814740	6820340	machine all these little sit down cabinets people playing counter strike so interesting but not
6820340	6824740	something you're going to see over here anytime soon i'm sure that dark soccer are we able to get
6824740	6831940	those yes cool what's up well um how about first off sonic and all stars racing transformed has
6831940	6838740	bonus edition with an outrun track and metal sonic oh and it has an in-game emoticon sticker
6838740	6842580	pack but will it have magical sound shower i don't care because it has the opa opa
6842580	6855460	and then rock smith it's uh getting a base mode on uh august 14th looks like so uh it will have
6855460	6861940	a basis that can improve their skills with um two finger plucking slapping and popping sounds very
6862740	6867780	dirty but it also has base technique challenges tutorial videos and mini games
6867780	6875700	so lots of base stuff because base is awesome i am partial to the base and then how about this for
6875700	6884660	quake con steam's having a sale bethesda games are cheap it's um the quake con bundle that's
6884660	6891780	going to have uh 20 games and again i'm reading this off of a british site so 300 pounds worth

6927300	6933700	the frugal question of the week take facebook take google put it together you get frugal
6935860	6940260	and we ask a question of our facebook and google plus communities every week and read some of the
6940260	6945940	answers here on the show and to poll our folks in studios as well as to their thoughts on this
6945940	6951300	question we'll start with google plus tonight here's the question an article on vog earlier
6951300	6954900	this week i hope y'all are reading the articles at vog i know we don't we haven't been publishing
6954900	6958660	a lot but we've been trying to get some stuff out there and there was a good one this week from alan
6959780	6964020	and i'm not just saying that because he lives here but he wrote a good article about minecraft and
6964020	6968660	kind of what made him really like the game the third try you know the first time he played
6968660	6972900	minecraft he was like what the hell is this shit but you know the second second time a little more
6972900	6977540	third time finally found fell in love with it so our question to the frugals this week is has
6977540	6982180	there ever been a game that you really didn't like the first time you played it only to come
6982180	6987380	back a second or third or fourth time and fall in love with it what do you think caused the change
6987380	6992500	in your opinion so i'm sure some of us here in studio can think of games like this but
6992500	6996580	what is the game we'll get around here in a minute all right let's start with panaxium on
6996580	7001540	google plus for me it was the civilization franchise i just couldn't get into it but then
7001540	7007140	i started downloading all the awesome mods for civ 4 and that changed everything fantasy world
7007140	7014740	yes please sci-fi colonization hell yeah so lots uh redertainment says yes in fact i'll be playing
7014740	7020180	it when this show airs dragon age origins i used to not be into high fantasy at all then game of
7020180	7025940	thrones came out now i'm reconsidering all high fantasy properties including dragon age i might
7025940	7030740	even watch lord of the rings again and this time not fall asleep during it very interesting so it's
7030740	7036580	kind of like asleep reading it you know what i don't when i saw a movie in the theater and it's
7036580	7040980	one of my favorite movies this is a couple years ago uh stardust you ever seen that movie it's i
7040980	7047060	love that movie it's so good i have it on hd dvd yeah it's based on yeah me too and blu-ray it's
7047060	7052020	based on the neil gaiman novel and i thought the the uh movie turned out great michelle pfeiffer
7052020	7057940	is great and all that but um when i came home from watching the movie i suddenly wanted to play elder
7057940	7063860	scrolls oblivion like it's kind of weird how but that's the same type of thing that redertainment
7063860	7067700	is talking about watching game of thrones made him want to play dragon age origins chair of swords
7067700	7077460	this weird kind of for the record reading tolkan is gonna take it's gonna take patience
7078340	7081540	good stories as long as you get past the descriptions of the countryside
7081540	7087940	just saying how about that whole hobbit going into three movies i'm excited i i read the
7087940	7091940	hobbit when i was a kid and i freaking love that yes they have enough to fill it with no
7091940	7099700	yeah no no that's three movies i don't see i like the original lord of rings anyway let's go to
7099700	7104260	yeah i love the whole original 20 endings right there's something let's go to facebook this might
7104260	7108580	surprise you again games you didn't fall in love with until second or third time you played it
7108580	7114740	all second or third time you played it shane y'all know shane this should be in chat this i think he's
7114740	7119860	raiding or something tonight this answer might surprise you mass effect no joke way back when
7119860	7124020	the first game was on xbox 360 i gave it a go because of all the things people were saying
7124020	7128740	i didn't make it past eden prime before i decided it was dumb years later i got a free copy of two
7128740	7133060	on pc for buying dragon age 2 so i gave it a go and thought it was pretty eh i didn't even get
7133060	7137300	much farther than the opening escape from the server of space before i just quit caring a short
7137300	7141300	time later i picked up the first game because i figured i should have the collection on pc for
7141300	7145940	some reason i made it past eden prime this time but again didn't care and then the trailers for
7145940	7150100	mass effect 3 came out and i thought it looked so cool i forced myself to get in the first game and
7150100	7155300	something just clicked it was amazing and i couldn't stop playing and then things made much
7155300	7160260	more sense in two it was fantastic and that's how i came to love the greatest game series ever so
7160260	7167700	effect uh let's see osfer replied and said this happened to me with league of legends i initially
7167700	7171860	tried it and just couldn't get into the game at all but i also wasn't too sure what i was doing
7171860	7175620	after coming back to it and having friends show me what to do i liked it a little more but still
7175620	7183300	wasn't hooked until i found a character that i really liked to play uh going to mary says uh
7183300	7188500	wow world of warcraft i played my warlock up to level 30 something but still really had no freaking
7188500	7192660	clue what i was doing and ended up just leaving it for a year maybe six months i don't know whatever
7192660	7198020	it was when i came back i got up to max level got my warlock super special level 60 mount at level
7198020	7203700	70 thanks to my old oov buddies for helping out with that and still had never run a real instance
7203700	7207700	did some karazhan with the guild and ended up learning to actually raid yay for second chances
7207700	7213860	and wow cody t replies it would probably have to be the call of duty games i tried to play him a
7213860	7217780	long time ago and never really understood why people thought they were so fun until i had a
7217780	7222340	child and didn't get as much time to play video games and those games multiplayer wise are easy
7222340	7227140	to pick up and play for five or ten minutes and another is borderlands for the same reason i'm not
7227140	7234020	that good of fps games lol reginator says this may be a cop-out answer but i'd have to say the final
7234020	7239300	fantasy series i know it's kind of broad i had the original on the nes as a kid which is why parents
7239300	7242980	bought for me at the time i didn't really appreciate the game or what would eventually
7242980	7247700	become a long-running series it wasn't until i saw commercials for final fantasy 7 and eventually
7247700	7253460	played it when i finally found love and appreciation for the final fantasy series uh let's see
7253460	7258260	degenerate johnny says too human fits the bill when i first rented the game i was displeased
7258260	7262500	because i wasn't used to the second analog stick as a form of movement and attack rather than
7262500	7266660	camera control for the first time i found myself agreeing with popular reviewers and i took the
7266660	7271460	game back to gamefly i rented the game again to help my niece with her homework she was studying
7271460	7275940	norse mythology and entertainment i finally got used to the controls but still got ticked off
7275940	7280100	after getting the achievement for dying a hundred times we should be able to remove those from our
7280100	7284180	gamer score i finally bought the game when some friends of mine invited me to play with them in
7284180	7289060	co-op i had the time of my life when we were playing and i can see the ingenuity that silicon
7289060	7293860	knights was trying to accomplish with too human ever since then we get together and play a campaign
7293860	7298980	or two over drinks once you get past the controls the game is quite enjoyable just don't play alone
7299860	7304340	so there you go some answers from our facebook community there are more i'm sorry i didn't get
7304340	7309060	to read all of them but check them out at facebook.com orange lounge radio let's quickly
7309060	7313540	go around the room and see what you guys think games you didn't love the first time but you fell
7313540	7319700	in love the second or third time dark sakura wow yeah easy for you i know well moving off of wow
7319700	7325220	because honestly it was really until they tweaked the gameplay to where i liked it um i'm actually
7325220	7329620	going to add mass effect on the list because i'd watch dan play through it at first and i was like
7329620	7333860	oh this is kind of boring first person shooters make me sick blah blah blah blah blah and honestly
7333860	7339060	i had a hard time getting into it on xbox until i started playing on pc and then boom all the
7339060	7341540	way through the game all the way through the second one all the way through the third one
7341540	7346500	i beat all three games in the span of a month just saying and i'm still playing mass effect three
7346500	7353860	again uh loki call of duty modern warfare i didn't like it the first time i played it what clicked
7353860	7361540	for you i don't know something uh for me most of mine have already been said believe it or not
7361540	7365380	world of warcraft the first time i played it i left for a while didn't end up coming back
7365380	7370980	till burning crusade and then that's when i fell in love with it um mass effect is a big one
7370980	7377220	because i played that and you know passed off my review of it sometime excuse me some time
7377220	7380580	ago and then just came back and loved it and i don't even know what clicked i think i just
7380580	7384580	i played from the beginning instead of in the middle and that made a huge difference
7384580	7390660	actually you know what i have to say hmm garris uh minecraft is another big one if i have to name
7390660	7396260	one that hasn't been named yet wait maybe you have yet to maybe you'll i've tried minecraft
7396260	7402660	and i really do not care for it we'll see uh i would say halo halo i didn't like the first time
7402660	7406980	i played it because like first person shooter controller but it was the first time i did an
7406980	7413620	lan local area network because remember the first halo wasn't on xbox live uh it wasn't around yet
7413620	7417940	it wasn't around yet when i played that first halo in a local area network oh it was awesome
7418500	7423540	so awesome uh bradley anything that comes to mind for you okay uh there's nothing i can say that
7424740	7429380	all the way i didn't hate it i hated it i loved it but there was one game uh i played i started
7430020	7436180	the game adam zombie smasher i played it uh a demo of it at uh packs last year and there was a guy
7436180	7440660	there then it kind of threw you in and i didn't know how to play it and so it was i said i don't
7440660	7444820	feel like playing this game but it came up in one of the humble bundles and i tried to play it
7444820	7450340	and it starts you off from just doing one thing rather than several things so so i basically got
7450340	7455060	it into it for a little while and when i played it there and went through a big game so that was
7455060	7461300	one that came with from i don't care to actually like the game pretty well all right very cool
7461940	7466340	very cool well thank you guys again for answering on facebook and google and of course those of y'all
7466340	7472820	here in studio to register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on
7472820	7478820	vog network.com use the passphrase sugar uh we will continue on with some news we do have the
7478820	7484420	mailbag if use of the week and twitter topics skype line all those ways to interact coming
7484420	7491220	right up but first more news loki all right um so let's talk a little bit about
7491220	7497940	steam and i know i purchased a few things on the steam sale uh during the summer here
7497940	7505860	i did also happen to see the update to the uh the terms of service that they have
7506740	7513220	now they have you agree to a steam subscriber agreement that basically bars you from
7513220	7520660	filing the class action lawsuit and um kind of similar to what we saw with sony and microsoft
7521380	7525700	and of course you know they said we've considered this change very carefully it's clear to us in
7525700	7530740	some situations class actions have the real benefit to the consumer in far too many cases
7530740	7535540	however class actions don't provide any real benefit to users and instead impose unnecessary
7535540	7539940	expense and delay and are often designed to benefit the class action lawyers who craft and
7539940	7546900	litigate these claims you know i gotta say at least it was a very honest as far as corporate
7546900	7552020	can be a very honest letter which you know we kind of val's been pretty good about communicating
7552020	7556260	with their community they really have you know especially through some of the other um you know
7556260	7561060	like when they were hacked and all that they were pretty transparent with all that um and that it's
7561060	7566420	happening here too um i don't know how i feel about this i mean obviously this is the trend
7566420	7571060	in the gaming industry i've got to admit there's still a part of me that wonders if that can really
7571060	7575300	hold up in court like i understand they're doing it to cover their butts and whatever but can it
7575300	7579860	really hold up in court i don't think it's been tested you can still file a lawsuit against them
7579860	7586500	but you just can't do it as a group right but i'm saying that i i'm just saying does that necessarily
7586500	7592500	stop it i mean do they have the power to put that in the agreement and force you to agree to that
7592500	7597380	you're waiving your right to sue us a group i'm i'm surprised that hasn't been tested yet and i
7597380	7602980	think it will i think it's gonna be a little bit difficult with them too because um you know you
7602980	7607220	bought all these games they give you no warning that also i mean i guess it would be in the end
7607220	7611780	user license agreement that oh you can change this at any time you know that all of a sudden
7611780	7615860	no i can't use these games unless i agree to this i would think that a judge would see that as
7615860	7622500	unreasonable like you know you you can't expect to just all of a sudden you know cut off the service
7622500	7627380	that this user is paid for because you know you just put this clause in place that they don't want
7627380	7633700	to agree to all of a sudden you know it's kind of ridiculous it's just i guess there's that part of
7633700	7639300	me that says why do we let corporations dictate what rights we do and don't have and i i totally
7639300	7644340	understand the viewpoint of well then don't agree to it or whatever but yeah it didn't do it
7644340	7649460	or whatever but yeah didn't didn't somebody say or maybe i saw it on reddit or something or saw
7649460	7653460	it somewhere where somebody was like well what happens if i don't agree to it do i get to access
7653460	7661060	my games anymore and the answer was essentially no so i i would that hold up in court i'm not so sure
7661860	7667780	i i i guess maybe i'm just i don't know trying to root for the little guy or whatever but the same
7667780	7674180	because sometimes you know these courtside with people based on like common sense you know i guess
7674180	7678180	and sometimes they you know they're like well it was in the end user license agreement but
7678180	7682820	i don't even know like how much of those end user license agreements are even like viable nowadays
7682820	7688660	because they've got some of those you know that are in the manual or some that aren't even in a
7688660	7692980	manual they're like in a digital manual somewhere out there on the web so a lot of times you don't
7692980	7700020	even see these things until you you know you know you go and search them out so that i don't really
7700020	7704420	understand if that's the case but like something that they force you to read every time you play
7704420	7709140	the game or something like that um oh maybe i don't really know how it works uh game guru in
7709140	7714260	chat good point from game guru at live.vognetwork.com says it has been tested the supreme court ruled
7714260	7720420	for them hence why everyone's added no class action lawsuits clauses um that's right i think
7720420	7725940	it was an at and t thing if i remember right i i i totally understand that but i just think if
7725940	7731780	something bad enough happens it's really gonna put this to the test and maybe that particular
7731780	7735780	scenario wasn't the right scenario i'm totally i totally understand why they want to block all
7735780	7740660	this frivolous lawsuit crap and there are a lot of very frivolous class action lawsuits i get that
7740660	7746420	but if something really bad happens i don't know and maybe there's that tinfoil hat part of me that
7746420	7753860	wonders why does val feel the need to do this what news is about to come out um maybe it's the whole
7753860	7760980	lawsuit that was in um europe perhaps the whole you know used games thing maybe they're just
7760980	7766260	trying to prevent something like that happening over here interesting interesting thought why
7766260	7771620	did you make me buy so many cheap games during the summer sale i'm gonna sue you because i'm
7771620	7777060	irresponsible all right we'll see what develops with this as we move on you know most people are
7777060	7781140	pretty forgiving of steam but uh certainly there's gonna be a few people like that guy who tried to
7781140	7785540	get around it i i didn't was there a postcard clause or any of that i don't think there was
7787300	7792740	uh moving on completely different topic here this is about ea sports and their season ticket
7793460	7800900	the season ticket is a subscription uh what is it i think it's 30 for this season ticket thing
7800900	7809220	and you get some freebies free dlc that obviously otherwise would be paid dlc um you get free packs
7809220	7815700	free packs of cards for madden fifa and nhl ultimate team modes is this do the sports games
7815700	7822260	work like mass effect 3 where like you open up the boxes and get cards and they are like like in mass
7822260	7826900	effect 3 it's weapons and team members and stuff like is that no because that's another ea game no
7826900	7831220	what happened i have to be honest i don't play these games so what is this card thing in madden
7831780	7836820	the card thing in madden is for remember how there was the whole fifa hacks they have that
7836820	7841540	the ultimate team yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the madden version of it what do those cards get you
7841540	7847060	if they're digital cards they get you perks for your players on the teams that's interesting i
7847060	7851140	that never clicked for me before but that is very similar to the mass effect 3 thing yeah you
7851140	7857220	basically you basically trade with other people and stuff or you oh you trade you you buy or you
7857220	7863460	well they sell counts or sell stuff i don't know but somehow there's real money stuff involved in
7863460	7868100	it and remember you know before the whole season pass or whatever they're calling it was basically
7868100	7872660	to get access to these games a few days before they would come out you would get like a digital
7872660	7878020	version that you would play and then the you'd go purchase the real game on um the release day
7878020	7884100	and then that digital version would stop working um other things the season ticket had done in the
7884100	7889060	past early access to full titles that got deleted when the games were actually released yeah yeah
7889060	7895220	yeah interesting and it used to be discounts on premium content but now it's a little different
7895220	7899620	they're saying though that there's no way you'd actually be able to pay for it as you if you bought
7899620	7906260	like all of the dlc which i'm sure they'd love to have you do uh sj100 matt says rob yep you
7906260	7910740	are correct it's the same thing in the nhl games now blackwolf says you can use real money to buy
7910740	7915060	new cards but there was an in-game auction house that uses the point system that you get for
7915060	7921380	playing ultimate team live.vog network.com and monty boggs great comment hard to call it free
7921380	7928660	if it costs thirty dollars that is true it's like playstation plus but i see i like playstation plus
7928660	7933140	i think playstation plus that whole thing's really come a long way and it's got a lot of value
7933140	7940660	i gotta say it's interesting interesting we'll see how many people um sign up for it i'm sure
7940660	7945220	there's enough if they're continuing it into a second year from the first year meanwhile some
7945220	7950740	more news stories for you guys dark soccer yes um in other news we actually have some mass effect
7950740	7956660	goodies about the wii u which uh is kind of eye-rolling every time i think of the wii u but
7956660	7961700	i'll go ahead um it's going to basically have touch screen control so that you can see a map
7961700	7967060	of your immediate areas where your squad mates are and where the enemies are highlighted you have four
7967060	7971380	powers and abilities that are on each side of the gamepad screen so you can just select one without
7971380	7976500	having to go to your quick menu although honestly my quick menu is my friend i'm like pause hold
7976500	7985060	this pause um basically uh it was also um at the ea summer showcase where they had the first viewing
7985060	7991140	of mass effect 3 on wii u um but the graphics are pretty much going to be the same as how they were
7991140	7997140	on the ps3 and xbox 360 version i honestly think that the pc version is still going to top all of
7997140	8002100	them because you can tweak it as much as you need to also there's going to be um an interactive
8002100	8008020	comic to go with that one kind of like how mass effect 2 genesis was for the ps3 so that if you
8008020	8011860	missed out on the previous games then you can make all of your decisions and then move forward
8011860	8014900	that's good to know because we wanted to know how that was going to work like how are they
8014900	8020020	going to catch the nintendo fans up yeah and then this is the thing that makes me happy mass effect
8020020	8027300	3 leviathan there's reaper dlc that's gonna come out you get to shoot reapers in the face well i'm
8027300	8031940	looking forward to shooting a reaper in the face it's about time for some single player dlc too
8031940	8035860	like i realized the whole extended cut set everything back but i've been foaming at the
8035860	8039300	mouth for dlc it's almost been six months in the game they were saying that it's supposed to also
8039300	8044580	affect the ending i can see that like maybe an extra little cutaway or sign i think i don't
8044580	8048180	think it's like it'll be like a five second cutaway or something i don't think it'll be
8048180	8052820	anything major i'm just trying to see um when the release date for that one was and i had seen it
8052820	8059940	before and completely missed it but um in fact i'm double checking here's what i really want to
8059940	8064980	know about the reaper ending or this leviathan based ending without spoiling too much will you
8064980	8072900	still cry when ed dot dot dot i cried so much but i more cried over garris because keep in mind
8072900	8078900	keep in mind i started with the extended cut when i played it and the whole little goodbye part on
8078900	8086500	the normandy i just like i'm not gonna spoil anything and it's not i will say this i'm not
8086500	8091220	talking about dies like i know a lot of people are like oh great rob it's dies nope that's not it
8091220	8094260	if you've beaten the game you know what i'm talking about one of the particular endings
8094260	8104100	there's a moment when ed and dot dot dot and it's like oh yeah it's a little bit of a cleft
8104980	8111780	well they said on here um also that um there's notice there they actually said there were some
8111780	8116100	things leaked in the script that actually link it to the extended cut so
8116100	8124500	all right loki all right done formulating my uh message to ernie klein um
8126500	8133300	i had to use i had to use tweet longer and quit longer anyways so patents lots of patents um
8133300	8140260	connect patents this is kind of weird too because this patent basically allows um taking connect
8140260	8146340	i guess into mobile cameras so allowing you to use um you know like uh your phone or something
8146340	8157300	like that to basically scan people into into a game that's kind of interesting and um apparently
8157300	8163540	they said that uh you know it's a mobile environment sensor it determines the trajectory
8163540	8168740	through a room and generates a depth map as it goes whether you're using a mobile device or
8168740	8176340	as it goes whether using i guess um you know the infrared sensor or stereoscopic cameras and um
8176340	8181220	they said the visual mapping isn't enough the camera relies on motion sensor like an accelerometer
8181220	8188420	to better judge its position as it's moved around and um that's interesting does this mean the next
8188420	8192980	windows phone is going to have connect built in for no particular reason but maybe to take like
8192980	8199860	a 3d picture of my face maybe uh they also filed another patent that basically um uses the connect
8200500	8208260	um for i guess um directing movies you can you know use your hands the gesture to you know do
8208260	8214820	different movie editing stuff uh also uh i guess the depth camera both generates the model
8214820	8221140	environment and also creates 3d props out of real objects so augmented reality stuff motion capture
8221140	8231540	and i guess um doing other uh you know augmented reality stuff that's kind of neat so um
8233300	8238180	interesting i mean a lot of people have been trying to do like video stuff with that like a
8238180	8243220	lot of augmented reality stuff so and that would kind of tie in with that you know the whole
8243220	8248820	supposedly leaked plan or their timeline or whatever that they were planning on doing the
8248820	8256420	next system with all that crazy connect stuff uh dj morpheus in our chat room says i would
8256420	8260900	love to have the ability to have my in-game character look like me via image capture
8264180	8268980	so didn't they don't they have that on the 3ds and doesn't it not work very well
8270580	8277620	yeah pretty much but the 3ds remember it has that front camera but the front's not 3d only the back
8277620	8281060	i mean there's three cameras in the 3ds if you think about it one in the front two in the back
8281060	8288500	for 3d images it's a little you know anyhow speaking of nintendo and patents i don't know if
8288500	8294260	you guys remember this but uh cooper in or excuse me copper innovation innovations group filed a
8294260	8302740	lawsuit against nintendo it was a patent lawsuit back in 2008 and it's just now over to remind you
8302740	8308500	because you probably forgot copper innovations group claimed that the wiimote and the we console
8308500	8316580	infringed on a 1996 patent for quote handheld computer input apparatus and method and if you
8316580	8321780	this looks like a mouse like you look at the little figures whatever anyway uh pittsburgh
8321780	8328260	u.s district court uh basically found it in nintendo's favor halting the need for a jury
8328260	8334100	trial or trial uh nintendo of course is pleased with the decision and thanks their legal team
8334100	8340820	and so forth i think most of this us saw this as a patent troll type of thing there's a lot of these
8340820	8345460	type of lawsuits that took four years to resolve and it hadn't even gone to jury yet it actually
8345460	8354420	got cut off before it went to jury the judge basically said nah nah amazing the legal system
8354420	8361460	in this country is so interesting i know i'm not a lawyer but that doesn't stop everybody on the
8361460	8366820	internet from pretending to be one let's get to the mailbag oh joy
8369700	8374900	let's see what home white homemade lawyers oh boy i don't know what is wrong with my talking

8390020	8396660	from steven w home does get a bad rep from how it used to be back in the day to what it is currently
8396660	8400740	going down with its updates with the recent updates and fixes they have pushed out some
8400740	8405460	really good content and finally fixed the glitch that allowed users for using others does home
8405460	8412020	still have its issues why yes it does but it does what comes when software is still in beta sorry
8412020	8417700	this is very run on sentencing home is constantly evolving and with evolution comes bugs if you look
8417700	8421140	past those bugs and look at the community the atmosphere surrounding it and all of the events
8421140	8428100	slash games within home you see how epic it is so yes home gets a bad rep but it has a lot of
8428100	8433540	good inside of it who does it is it like a pinata so everyone should hop on and check it out even
8433540	8440100	if it's for a few moments if i beat it with a stickle candy come out possibly somebody won a
8440100	8445940	20 gift card last week of course that had nothing that was not sony sanctioned that was a generous
8445940	8451540	fan helping another generous fan out but i'm glad to see good i'm glad some people followed through
8451540	8455700	because i don't know if you remember but during hey it's not time for the effus yet be quiet
8455700	8460020	during last week's show i actually asked all those guys in playstation home i said does your network
8460020	8464980	get a bad rap does home get a bad rap so i'm glad i'm glad somebody followed through with that thank
8464980	8473700	you for replying okay well um moving forward hello this is from nasty canasta oh hello olr
8473700	8477220	i'm my favorite nicknames by the way that emails the show because i think about the car game
8478020	8484660	i think of old people it's like strip canasta or something nasty i'm not sure if you covered this
8484660	8489140	before but you might be interested in a teaser for an upcoming pc first person horror game called
8489140	8493860	among the sleep the protagonist for among the sleep is a two-year-old aside from the utter
8493860	8497940	helplessness you have to deal with playing as this poor toddler imagine if you also had to struggle
8497940	8502980	with the baby's current developmental stage how could the game screw with how could the game screw
8502980	8509460	with you if this kid didn't grasp the concept of object permanence yet scary ps garris well
8509460	8515700	i think a two-year-old understands object permanence says the parent of a two-year-old
8515700	8520580	i i actually peeked in the mailbag earlier and i watched the little trailer for this thing and it
8520580	8527140	looks creepy as hell and that's that's that's a weird concept for a game to me that's like when
8527140	8531060	you do things about children that's always a little creepy yeah i'd like to stay away from
8531060	8535940	that at least the child doesn't get eaten by a grew or something it's just you know it's it was
8535940	8543620	it was a scary looking game i gotta say me it's like amnesia level scary okay well moving forward
8543620	8549140	this one is it's for me hi guys i just wanted to share my happiness to all of you especially
8549140	8553700	dark sakura i have found and purchased three rare nes cartridges those are my favorite adventure
8553700	8558580	titles from the nest era uh i first wanted to know if dark soccer recognizes one or two
8558580	8564580	banana oji no dai bulken which i do it came out as banana prince in the u.s armadillo um which i
8564580	8571140	don't think came out in the u.s and then panic restaurant which um actually that is the u.s
8571140	8574180	release and i went to find because i only remembered like half of the name because it was
8574180	8581460	something gourmet world it was one paku koku no gourmet gourmet world and it came out in 1992 and
8581460	8587860	was published by taito where you play as a guy named cookie who looks like chef boyardee not to
8587860	8591300	be confused with the announcer from you don't know jack this is this is one of those games that had
8591300	8597380	one of those classic things of mistranslation of a name because the bad guy in the game was called
8597380	8604420	was called um odor but it was french to japanese so when it came to translating it from japanese to
8604420	8613060	english they called him o'dove but the chef in the japanese version had the best name as naughty
8613060	8620740	cocoon so that was a good name um banana prince was sort of like kind of uh a jack in the beanstalk
8620740	8625060	kind of game where you could get seeds and plant flowers and shit and climb to get to different
8625060	8632500	rooms and stuff it was a neat little game and um it was by takura and then armadillo um was sort
8632500	8637140	of like super mario 3 where you had like a map that you could move from world to world um i know
8637140	8642500	of all three of those games so yeah good job dude you can send me your copy of armadillo if you want
8642500	8649620	i'll play the fuck out of it um so uh this is let me know your opinion and happy podcasting
8649620	8656020	um banana prince is pretty cute pretty fun um armadillo is pretty fun i actually did not play
8656020	8661460	panic restaurant but i've seen it i've seen i know someone who had panic restaurant when i was
8661460	8669460	younger so just saying i didn't get into it okay moving forward shall i this comes from clover
8669460	8675140	nikon hi guys and gal just writing in to say that i am loving the show and loving the vog network

8709940	8716260	more wait i was trying to find something for that last email here hold on hold on be happy wedding
8716260	8720900	no no no no we already did happy when we already did happy wedding a couple weeks ago for tiara and
8720900	8742020	dan this is the other song remember para para paradise paradise dave domino and virginal
8742020	8750180	anniversary there you go hey all i've just started my tour in the mass effect universe
8750180	8754340	i have to say that i have owned both one and two on steam for at least two years now i am hooked
8754900	8760180	played through the first one in about 22 hours i'm absolutely in love this game is epic honestly
8760180	8764900	had chills from the first two minutes when five year later spoil alert shepherd crawled out from
8764900	8771540	the wreckage some things happen in my game of in my game though that make me sit in my office during
8771540	8775940	the day and question my decisions when one of my favorite characters was shot and killed i wanted
8775940	8781620	so badly to reload my game and make different choices yet i different didn't you totally could
8781620	8786900	have yeah i i continued on letting the decisions i had made played out for the rest of the story
8786900	8793460	my question is which choice based games such as kotor mass effect heavy rain fable do you go with
8793460	8797860	your gut feeling and let the story play out as it will or try to change it in the way that you want
8797860	8804500	it um mass effect i played i've actually playing the second one the exact damn same way i've played
8804500	8810100	the last one my last playthrough on mass effect 3 the only thing that i changed was i killed caden
8810100	8814900	and played with ashley using my save file editor just so i could see what ashley was like in mass
8814900	8821220	effect 3 i have to admit mass effect was really the first game where i didn't feel this need to
8821220	8826900	do everything perfect because usually when i play rpgs i'm kind of that anal retentive search every
8826900	8833460	corner talk to every person in the town explore every story do every side quest and there comes
8833460	8838900	a point when you're playing these bioware games where you just have to realize you can't do that
8838900	8845300	you cannot do it is not possible without playing the game 500 times so mass effect was really one
8845300	8851140	of the first games to kind of like get and i realized this is very recent but it's it's a
8851140	8857060	different way of thinking for me so and it's not been easy so that's my long-winded answer
8857060	8868580	well um i also did play dragon age 2 and i really liked it but it was like when i started romancing
8868580	8873860	uh what's her name that was voiced by eve miles i was like oh my god she's annoying oh my god
8873860	8878660	she's annoying so i started going after fenris because it's like oh he's kind of broody i'd go
8878660	8884580	for fenris um i didn't really play the fable games because i really didn't like them that much
8884580	8889700	dan played the crap out of them i started on fable 2 and i liked fable and i never finished
8889700	8896180	any of them i which is weird because i own them all um my favorite choice ever was how to bitch
8896180	8902660	slap the bitch slap fight in final fantasy 7 just saying and those you know choose your the the
8902660	8907940	little mud games or choosing who you would date in final fantasy 7 yeah trying to get the barrett
8907940	8913940	date fuck no it was always tifa and i did not use that bitch arith more than i had to because she
8913940	8921220	was a ho bag fuck her and now she's tell us how you really feel i have my i still have my save file
8921220	8927060	i know where i can kill her as much as i want to and the jenova fight which is fun that's like the
8927060	8932180	most fun fight in the damn game is that jenova fight um because i'm so giddy from her being dead
8932180	8938580	maybe you just like the music i really love the freaking no i love the jenova music
8938580	8945620	oh i hate the earth music um because i hate everything about the bitch anyway also completely
8945620	8950420	off topic but i've ordered sound shapes any of you guys played demos or have any thoughts about it
8950420	8955220	i really needed something fresh on my vita it's got an inch of dust and shame on it at the moment
8955220	8962820	the dust and shame i like that keep up the great work travis i like that dust and shame uh i have
8962820	8967940	not personally played sound shapes but shane who's a friend of mine will not shut up about

9480820	9488420	uya support i'm assuming that's of course if they hit their kickstarter goal um final fantasy 3 is
9488420	9494100	going to be one of the launch titles for um the uya which is kind of interesting of course that
9494100	9500980	was just recently released on android but they will be doing a version for the uya um kind of

10182820	10188100	shooters where you could be invincible idq and all that stuff no i'm not doing anything like that i
10188100	10191620	just played it through and like i said i was just going with my gut feeling on everything that i
10191620	10197140	said and i was i was actually a complete asshole in the game and and the whole like oh what do you
10197140	10202740	want to do with the council at the end and i'm like yeah screw them kill them yeah exactly i'm
10202740	10208820	just after sovereign but no um i got i got two other things about it though uh you guys were
10208820	10213620	just talking about musicals has anybody or have any of y'all seen uh video games live because
10213620	10219220	it's coming i'm in florida yeah and it's coming to uh st p and i'm so excited to see it it was
10219220	10226180	a long time ago maybe um maybe dark long long ago no no i'm saying uh maybe dark tetsuya who is like
10226180	10231700	the olr historian will know the episode number but we actually had tommy talarico on the show for like
10231700	10238580	an uber interview like 45 minutes long he actually announced that first soundtrack cd on our show
10238580	10242740	so it was a while ago i mean that was that was some time ago but yes we not only had tommy on
10242740	10246820	the show of several years ago to pimp it the first time but we went and saw it in oakland
10246820	10251620	and it was really epic especially when master chief came out with the flag would y'all like to
10251620	10259540	hear a true story oh video games live was the first time i ever met alan in person oh other
10259540	10267860	than camp well i need another 45 minutes to get into that but let's just say in our adult lives
10267860	10273300	yes so this is funny anyway sorry yeah that no that's really cool because i mean i've been
10273300	10278580	wanting to see it for years and i i've got a spot on my account and i listen to like the the albums
10278580	10282980	on there and i'm just so stoked that it's coming back to florida again i can't wait to see it but
10282980	10289540	my my other question was is have you guys heard about the game or it's a mod for arma called or
10289540	10296020	arma 2 it's called dayz yeah has anybody gotten into that or what is it all about because i'm a
10296020	10301060	huge walking dead fan and it reminds me so much of walking dead it's ridiculous um i haven't really
10301060	10304660	gotten a chance to play it because i'm still trying to figure out how map date or uh arma's
10304660	10312180	controls to my xbox 360 controller i've gotten close but it gets complicated um but apparently
10312180	10318740	it's very just it drops you down you have you know you have to go find resources and um you know
10318740	10323780	there's random groups of people walking around doing weird things like kidnapping people and
10323780	10327780	you know of course you're fighting zombies but it's more about the crazies that are out there too
10327780	10335220	which are all real people and that's and that's what i've heard and i i'm trying to like i guess
10335220	10339380	wrap my head around the point of the game because i it seems like the point is just to keep your
10339380	10344340	character alive as long as possible which seems kind of creative pretty much yeah and uh by the
10344340	10349460	way according to misty the other olr historian how dare i how dare i give that crown to only
10349460	10354340	one person because misty just came in and snatched that crown by saying episode 285
10354340	10360660	what was the tommy telerico interview thank you misty i'll have to try to look it up then um
10360660	10364980	yeah right right right now i'm playing through rage which everybody's told me to play through
10364980	10370740	and i it's good i guess it's kind of like a linear fallout in a sense now now's a good time for that

10636740	10641060	you smile or laugh when that last guy called in just to talk about how now now we've passed it
10641060	10647540	on we got him hooked on mass effect that's it needs to happen more often like i didn't listen
10647540	10654260	to the show earlier because i was playing other stuff but um i saw that i wasn't the only person
10654260	10659860	on your question of the week that said mass effect so i was kind of proud all right all right take
10659860	10665220	care buddy that let you go bye all right let's try to get a couple more calls there's just we're
10665220	10667380	getting slammed tonight hi you're on orange on this radio who's this
10669620	10676020	hey this is excellent hey excellent how you doing hi hey doing good wicked and rent for musicals
10676020	10679060	for me those were my two favorite to have soundtracks too so
10682180	10686180	but no uh for the record tonight was because i've been playing the last few days in the
10686180	10692980	course um some of our other friends have too was the kingdom hearts 3d uh dream drop distance uh
10693860	10699700	or 3d ddd as i like to shorten it to call it um it's been a really great game i really enjoyed
10699700	10703780	it it's been a lot a lot of fun it's really short but it's really fun though so
10703780	10707940	it's really taking a lot of the old stuff and tying it back in and making it so
10707940	10712660	um when three comes out at least it will bring the storyline up to that of part three
10717220	10724660	um did you get to try on world yes i did how was that that was a lot of fun i i really enjoyed it
10724660	10731700	that's um it it's it's very unique in its own way so i i really did enjoy i'll i'll
10731700	10738420	i really did enjoy a lot of it and how they're splitting the storyline up between riku and sora
10738420	10745860	so um let's see what else i was gonna ask about uh kingdom hearts oh yeah there's this funny
10745860	10750260	facebook post and maybe you saw it too that was like kingdom hearts explained and it's this really
10750260	10756980	complicated tree of relationships and it really did make me think like damn kingdom hearts really
10756980	10764420	is kind of like a it's a really complicated game and it was aimed at kids well it's because of the
10764420	10769940	different ways it branched out i mean you had you had um of course you had kingdom heart one you
10769940	10776180	had kingdom heart two you had the um you have recoded you had a chain of memory which chain
10776180	10781060	of memory was technically between one and two and then uh they branched out like these through the
10781060	10785700	little storylines and then finally with this one at least they're starting to take all the games
10785700	10789940	and saying okay here's the storyline between the games in case you didn't see like birth
10791140	10795780	birth by sleep was a prequel to everything and of course so it's pretty much was all over the place
10795780	10800500	but like i said before i like it how they they sat down with the game so far and they're pretty much
10800500	10805140	going through and tying everything together going okay this is the reason why this has happened
10805780	10809460	this is the reason why that one happened the way it did and this is the reason why this one
10809460	10813620	happened the way it did so it's kind of they're taking all the pieces tying it all together and
10813620	10818500	get ready for that big finale at the end hopefully so well i hope to hell it is kingdom hearts 3 i
10818500	10822580	got my fingers and toes crossed for tokyo game show announcement but then again we still have
10822580	10826900	to get through well they they did say they're they are making three which is really good
10826900	10832420	and it's just as to when oh who only knows and like i told you before i really hope when they
10832420	10837700	do they take their time they make sure they end it you know they they tie all everything together
10837700	10841460	and they end it in a way so we can go okay that was kind of cool kind of like with the whole mass
10841460	10847140	effect so is there one of them secret endings that gives you the extra scene that you know maybe it's
10847140	10851540	too soon to know but that kind of gives the big king yes there is i know that i just don't know
10851540	10857220	what it is exactly yeah but i hear it does tie in it's supposed to tie into that three so all right
10857220	10863060	well um before i let you go i just gotta let you know rant i wasn't such a fan of rent really yeah
10863060	10868740	i know i know a lot of people are into it but not me some people are some people aren't everybody
10868740	10873940	has their own you know all right well just like so i'll get hate mail for that don't worry all

11125220	11135940	doubt and countless others um you know uh i don't know it's kind of like i don't care anymore
11135940	11142580	because guitar hero it's not coming out anymore so yes they will never do that again because

11153460	11158900	sends us some tweets uh quite a few here uh one of them is about the world of warcraft movie
11159940	11165140	and uh i do remember reading about this the world of warcraft movie apparently it's still happening
11165140	11171300	sam ramie's not involved anymore but there is a new scribe uh charles leavitt is the new scribe
11171300	11177860	of the world of warcraft movie that is the dude who wrote the seventh son um what else did he do
11177860	11184260	uh blood diamond wait hold on what is this wait okay yeah he did do the latest script
11184260	11188580	okay so the seventh son is the latest movie that's coming out sorry i read these live
11188580	11194420	i haven't read this article in advance before it was tweeted to me um warner brothers is putting
11194420	11200820	out that seventh son pick on october 18th 2013 other movies he's written blood diamond the mighty
11200820	11205140	and k-packs i haven't seen any of those movies but blood diamond was oscar nominated right
11205140	11209060	it was oscar nominated for performance not for script it wasn't k-packs the one with kevin spacey
11209780	11214660	um yeah i did see that one yeah how was it was it well written it was all right yeah i think it's
11214660	11218580	well written all right so we don't know any details outside of that however they do say
11218580	11223380	legendary also has the mass effect film in development that is still a thing and that has
11223380	11228020	been kind of reaffirmed what the mass effect film no way yeah they're doing a mass effect film it's
11228020	11231860	supposed i was just talking about this earlier it's supposed to be based off the first game
11231860	11239300	but i'm it needs to be chick shepherd i'm you know what i i everybody's saying it's going to
11239300	11243300	be dude shepherd and i don't know if they made that announcement officially but i am i play a
11243300	11247380	dude shepherd in mass effect but for real i actually totally agree with you i think the
11247380	11252020	only way they're going to make the fans all of them happy is to do femshep in the movie and i
11252020	11256980	think it would be totally acceptable but at that point it's all about the casting if they don't
11256980	11262900	cast the right person as femshep and i don't know who is over by jennifer hale i don't well who who
11262900	11270660	could play femshep what actress would you be okay with playing femshep alice go to hell alice has
11270660	11277860	kim kardashian no no and more no all right i gotta pull this one up on the computer because tiger
11277860	11282660	claw sent us another link but it's to a video and it did kind of uh crack me up i actually saw this
11282660	11289460	earlier i think he or somebody else posted on facebook um and it's a guy getting a question
11289460	11295460	wrong on who wants to be a millionaire that you think everybody would know here it is now
11296020	11301140	apologies this is somebody shooting at their tv so he's going for the seven million dollar
11301140	11316100	question seven million dollar seven thousand dollar question well known to avid video gamers the key sequence up up down down left right left right be a start is a cheat code known as
11316100	11324580	what so everybody here knows that one right it's the konami code the capcom code yeah well that's
11324580	11335220	one of the answers well let me see if she reads them here seriously if you're gonna do a youtube

11360500	11365300	let's jump this question please no problem so he used his lifeline called jump the question which
