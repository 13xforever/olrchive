14092	18777	Tonight, August 5th, 2012, another MMO is set to go free to play.
19198	22862	Someone decides to take Zynga to court over an allegedly copied game.
23263	26267	And has the Wii U detailed launch lineup been revealed?
31846	38071	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38171	44956	It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 468 for August the 5th of 2012.
46357	53682	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you with my co-hosts over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff.
54062	54563	Here they are.
54683	57505	Say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
58485	58986	How are you doing?
59866	60627	I'm kind of in pain.
81679	84320	No, it's Bank of America, but I'm not going to say anything else.
85541	88122	But maybe a silver lining to it all, at least I hope.
88442	88702	I hope.
88922	89782	We're all pulling for you.
89902	90502	Something will come up.
91003	91323	We'll see.
91543	94404	If you listen to Bobby Blackwolf's show, let me just plug real quick.
94564	96285	Maybe I could work for Zynga and get sued.
97145	108373	Listen to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network and participate at live.vognetwork.com where we do tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
108433	112255	And as we learned on Bobby Blackwolf tonight, you never know who might recruit you.
112555	114497	So tune into that.
114517	115117	You know what?
115697	117038	I don't think I could work for evil.
118619	119420	All right, moving on.
119500	122262	Say hello to evil tech master Loki.
122522	123483	I could if they pay well.
123503	124884	I don't care what they do.
125264	126144	We slaughter kittens.
126345	126705	Okay.
127766	129607	Do I hear $100 for your soul?
129727	129607	$100, $100, $200.
130167	132949	How you doing, TechmasterLoki?
133029	135731	I mean, they'd be virtual kittens, but it's not real kittens.
136552	136872	Stop.
136912	137253	That's wrong.
138533	138794	What's up?
138814	139154	What's new?
139774	140255	Doing fine.
140475	140715	Yeah?
141476	142817	What was this project thingy?
142837	145258	You were showing me pictures of a project thingy you've been working on.
145799	147040	Oh, it was just brief.
147220	151883	I was trying to make something for Josh's birthday party because he had a Mario-themed birthday party, but...
153263	156025	Is this to match his Mario-themed bedroom and so forth?
156145	156985	Well, it's just this year.
157025	163429	Because last year was pork-themed, so... We decided that... I love that you threw a baby a pork-themed wedding.
164569	164889	Wedding?
165209	165810	Birthday.
165850	166510	Gee, Rob.
166670	167871	One step at a time, okay?
168311	168711	Seriously.
171813	173354	Maybe later on down the line.
175095	176255	I'd be down.
177356	180838	But no, he had a Mario birthday party.
181781	182141	All right.
182241	182621	That was fun.
182661	186542	So you made like a little paper mache, or no, that was more like a paper craft.
186562	187302	It's a paper craft.
187322	188063	Paper craft.
188163	188323	Koopa.
188343	189443	Like origami or something.
189763	193784	And it's pretty much full size.
193824	194804	It's over two feet tall.
195404	201686	But the thing is I didn't finish it because I neglected to look at the paper craft model that closely.
201726	209348	And apparently the way they have things connect together are impossible in reality because they just kind of phase through each other.
209708	215051	Yeah, that might work in a computer game, but it's not going to work when you have to glue stuff to other things.
215171	219313	It's like, okay, I have to cut a hole here, I guess, in order to get this to work.
219673	225897	I managed to get two of the pieces together before the show, like his leg in the shoe.
228035	229477	That was a pain in the ass.
229897	231519	This is going to take a long time.
231660	233562	You're the one that wanted to start arts and crafts.
233742	235344	Hey, but it's pretty much done.
236246	237727	The pictures look good.
237767	239590	We should try to get those up at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
240490	243472	But anyhow, let's also introduce, we have a special guest tonight.
243512	252477	I mean, it's a big night at the Voice of Geeks Network, and I'll explain why in just a little bit, but a big night made bigger by the return of a favorite guest to OLR.
252557	254238	He hasn't been here in some time.
254738	260821	The last time I remember you being here was the Marathon show, maybe one show after that, but you definitely haven't been here since the VOG switchover and all that.
261261	263102	Say hello to Arcadian42 is back.
264423	265044	Who's favorite?
267245	268406	It's been a while.
268466	269867	Yeah, probably last year.
270288	270568	Yeah.
270588	271829	So welcome back.
271969	273070	Maybe it's earlier this year, actually.
273631	273971	Maybe.
274331	276433	But it was in the old place.
276933	283318	So welcome to the smaller condensed studio at Casa de Rob and Alan.
283479	287522	So you fit a little bit better here with the open environment rather than a little room.
287802	288182	That's true.
288242	288622	And you know what?
288682	289763	Sometimes it works pretty good.
289803	294085	Like last week when we had the whole PlayStation Home thing going on, you know, it was going on on the TV over there.
294125	296466	So it's like, you know, we got we got a nice open space.
296506	298987	And once in a while, a cat might come through and try to lick your feet.
299127	299587	So we'll see.
300308	301308	Not likely.
302089	302269	Yes.
302549	305670	Marco might walk by, stick his tail in the air and then run off.
305870	306931	Not bloody likely.
308471	315233	So, if folks haven't heard you on the show before, let's try to tell the listeners a little bit about what you're all about.
315953	317374	You're a huge Sega fan.
317414	318554	I remember that about you, right?
318574	319754	Something like that.
319874	321855	I played a lot of Sega games when I was growing up.
322815	326776	I had Genesis and Saturn.
326876	330497	Basically, I have a bunch of Japanese Saturn games, though.
330737	331157	Thanks for watching!
350234	362466	I know you also do a lot of traveling, like following you on Facebook and everything.
362526	367130	You love to go on the, or at least it seems like, reading your Facebook, you love to go on these kind of like just adventures.
367510	371614	Like, I'm going to get in the car and drive to Yellowstone.
371714	372135	See you later.
372815	374937	Yeah, pretty much.
375077	377298	I've done a big road trip the last two or three years.
378899	382522	I haven't done too many small road trips other than going to Yosemite a bunch just for hiking.
382882	384183	You climbed Half Dome this year, right?
384383	384603	Yep.
384703	385003	Congrats.
385023	386084	I did that four years ago.
386404	392788	And you didn't get killed, which is a thing that unfortunately has a bit of a reputation for these days.
392908	394810	Yeah, you only get killed if you're stupid.
396710	397210	Allegedly.
397291	399091	So maybe they should change it to Half Darwin.
399411	399911	Allegedly.
400691	404953	I think there's only been one person who's died on a dry day.
406313	410334	They might have had a little bit to drink.
410454	414875	Most everything at the time was when it was stormy or wet or there was a thunderstorm or something around.
416516	419196	Someone got close like two months ago.
419216	420377	We almost fell off the side.
422477	428301	I know you like to kind of sometimes go to expos and conventions and things too because you're kind of like the norm of these things.
428501	429822	Like, you know, remember Cheers?
430222	433845	And it's kind of like, you know, I'll be at California Extreme and then all of a sudden, oh, Bradley's through the door.
434205	435886	Bradley is here.
436466	437787	Did you go to California Extreme this year?
437807	438308	Yes, yes, I did.
438448	439488	I just knew you did.
439608	440049	And I was so...
442390	444051	I was irritated I couldn't go.
444171	446073	I mean, granted, you know, I have to pick my priorities.
446153	450156	Do I want to do screening movie thingies or do I want to do California Extreme?
450256	451337	Did you run into Dan?
451437	454279	Yes, I ran into him once.
454319	458402	I was playing Kung Fu Master and he stopped by and said hi.
458662	459203	So how was it?
459243	460744	Since we couldn't review it, none of us went.
460804	461985	How was California Extreme this year?
462145	462726	That was pretty good.
463346	465268	Pretty much similar as usual.
465288	468070	A bunch of games here and there and everywhere.
470052	472354	Can't remember if there's anything super special there.
473375	475597	There was a bunch of new pinballs, but I didn't get to play them.
476197	478459	I don't know if they're new, but at least newer ones.
478980	480201	Did they have the Tron pinball?
480281	481602	I have yet to play that still.
481642	482483	Dan's friend owns one.
483303	484604	I'm going to visit Dan's friend.
484624	485505	One of the special editions.
485805	487026	Can't remember if I saw one or not.
487367	487987	It might have been there.
488007	489949	I just didn't get a chance to play it.
490327	491508	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
513004	529914	But it's just, yeah, it's just all these arcade owners, private owners mostly that own old arcade games and they just convene on a convention center or a hotel ballroom and it's just all these games you pay 40, 50 bucks and it's just free to play the whole weekend, all these old games.
529934	532275	And it's really an emphasis on classic games.
532295	536737	And I've got to play so much stuff that you just don't get to play anywhere anymore.
536818	541100	Like I played Journey the last time I was there and some pinball games.
541400	544882	Once in a while they have a couple new things here and there, but it's mostly about classic.
545283	551327	But I've got to say, Neil, a friend of mine, he sent me a video from California Extreme.
551427	552888	I guess, like, I don't know what it was.
552908	555690	It was one of those, like, animatronic bands they had.
556470	562354	He sent me a very scary video of the animatronic band singing Total Eclipse of the Heart or something.
562394	563555	I was like, what is this?
563755	565416	Yeah, I went by there just, like, once.
565756	570239	I kind of just passed by and went, saw it for, like, 10 seconds and went on to something else.
571740	572020	Nice.
572701	573921	As awesome as what it is.
594113	610974	of course you guys are here too the always present fourth guest on our show or I guess fifth tonight because we do have Arcadian 42 here tonight join us live participate with the show live at VOG Network the Voice Geeks Network live.vognetwork.com is where you can join our chat room and occasionally
611895	613817	We read comments from our chat room.
614317	616339	And yeah, DDRDollarBill is like, what?
616419	617140	Robotron?
618061	619702	What's Robotron?
619882	620703	No, Robotron.
621264	623626	Yeah, they do have it on Xbox Live Arcade.
625087	626909	It was one of the first Xbox Live Arcade titles.
626929	627309	I have it.
627509	627730	Yeah.
628350	631073	Robotron was a rejected 2DX character, just saying.
631633	633355	Little inside joke there for the music game fans.
634264	634924	I played it in band.
658339	658759	Did you really?
658939	659800	London 2012!
659900	665985	That one in the, was it 92 theme?
666825	667346	Play that too.
668386	673590	The Olympic event on a 12-hour tape delay, live from London.
674331	675972	Just change the AM to PM.
676772	685499	Anyhow, I don't actually really want to talk about the Olympics itself, but I want to talk about, because you know, you can probably go to any other website on the internet and read something about Michael Phelps.
686099	690303	But what I really want to talk about is I want to talk about a story that's circulating the internet.
690383	693586	And when I'm talking circulating the internet, I don't mean just like on the video game blogs.
693666	697190	I mean this is on CNN.com in their tech section right now.
697230	699512	So on CNN, they're running a story right now.
699812	702475	Should pro gamers be considered athletes?
703175	705217	And I think that's a good question I want to ask you guys tonight.
705337	707179	Oh, you're starting off with a bang.
707239	707840	No, why not?
707920	709982	Why should pro gamers not be considered athletes?
710339	711579	Because it's a video game.
711720	714421	It doesn't really require any physical prowess to be good at it.
714701	721823	Maybe some good hand-eye coordination, but the Olympics are traditionally a test of physical skill.
722424	723684	Maybe DDR?
724064	728326	I don't know, but it should be something purely physical.
728946	732867	Well, let me read some of the quotes from this article before I get too much more feedback.
732887	736229	And I definitely want your feedback in our chat room as well, live.vognetwork.com.
736849	741831	And the article talks about StarCraft II and one of the big players in South Korea, Marine King.
742351	747613	And he got kind of a bit of a reputation because he practiced 20 hours a day sometimes.
748233	750774	And that got him called a gaming addict.
751534	769173	but according to and CNN basically compiled some comments and according to one commenter on the CNN website one person said would you claim that Phelps is addicted to swimming so why did they want to say this guy was addicted to gaming because he trained 20 hours a week would you say that Michael Phelps is addicted to swimming no he's addicted to pot
772156	776462	Anyone who can smoke weed and then win 21 gold medals, you win.
776722	777243	You know what?
778024	779466	I'm not saying that's bad.
779526	781108	Didn't slow him down any.
781769	785495	Not that I personally endorse it, but it is kind of funny.
786115	788619	It does set that whole argument back a little bit, doesn't it?
788659	789039	But anyway.
790946	794928	Some folks say Marine King represents dedication, skill, perseverance.
794968	796468	He's one of the best in the world.
798429	800710	The skill required to be a pro gamer.
801750	808072	The original article that the folks had commented on, it didn't distinguish the difference between game addiction and professional gaming or even gaming as a hobby.
808472	815395	I do not believe the article shows the amount of skill needed to be one of the best in the world or how truly big professional gaming has become.
816235	818977	on physicality being an important part of athletics.
819038	820739	Again, these comments from CNN.com.
821239	822540	I wouldn't call them athletes.
822941	826504	The one common denominator with all Olympians is the physicality involved.
826904	829646	Even the word athlete refers to physical activity.
830027	834711	I have no issues with video gaming, but the Olympics just seems to be the wrong venue.
834811	835411	Exactly.
835431	838073	You know what venue that the Olympics needs?
838814	839795	Fuck this video game playing.
839855	841376	It's all about fucking laser tag.
841777	842717	Laser tag!
843798	844919	That is physical.
845159	846120	That is awesome.
846140	847000	That is what we need.
847020	848121	But then they could just do paintball.
849081	850022	I'd be fine with paintball.
850462	851743	I'd settle for paintball.
853264	854885	As long as they have to be active.
854925	860489	You know, I want some crazy Hunger Games-ish thing where if they don't move, then they explode.
860509	862890	Now that I'm not working, I think I should be a professional paintballer.
865892	867073	What about that for a career change, Rob?
868674	869174	You know what?
869234	870535	Now's the time to try new things.
870735	871596	Find what you really love.
872688	873889	I sure do love shooting people.
873909	874910	You could design guns.
875550	877111	You like design and you like guns.
877131	877832	You should design guns.
877852	879173	I'm going to design a new gun.
879553	881114	All right.
881274	884157	Loki, your thoughts.
884357	887299	Should video games, StarCraft II be an Olympic sport?
887459	887599	No.
888099	888400	Why not?
888660	889621	Because they don't do anything.
890001	893103	I mean, not saying they don't physically do anything.
894044	898227	Moving a mouse is not exercise or is not athletic in any way.
898767	899107	So, no.
899448	899868	I'm sorry.
899888	900949	That does not belong.
901718	903960	Somebody in chat just said a comment.
903980	905421	Cyber Olympics or something like that.
905721	909804	If we're going to create something that sort of way, then yeah, sure, why not.
910505	912266	Somebody in chat just said a comment.
912326	912947	I agree with 100%.
914228	915449	Bradley, I'll check in with you.
916249	917070	What do you think?
917430	919612	Do video games deserve to be in the Olympics or no?
920012	920433	No.
922174	923575	It's not only athletic or anything.
924376	925597	They could do a spectator.
925617	928359	It's not a spectator, but what do you call that?
928759	928859	Uh...
930699	931300	Exhibition.
931360	932300	Exhibition sort of thing.
932420	934001	Because they did something like that.
934121	935062	I can do exhibitions.
935962	937483	Not that type of exhibition.
937503	944367	But they did like, I know they were talking about the last time that London had Olympics, they had like an Olympic poetry competition.
945087	945627	Olympic poetry?
945647	946668	Wait a minute.
947728	949149	Is pole dancing an Olympic sport?
949169	949990	Because that's physical.
951410	952331	Loki, what, Loki?
954452	955032	I'm liking this.
955112	957154	Okay, you know what used to be an Olympic sport?
957794	958834	Solo synchronized swimming.
958955	959695	Hold on, hold on.
959955	960355	DarkSakura.
960415	960475	No.
960495	960915	Why not?
960935	961776	Because strippers.
982734	984014	Loki, should pole dancing be an elite sport?
984034	985034	Absolutely, and you know why?
985114	987335	Because it's not necessarily for strippers.
987535	990095	Yes, I understand that that is what they do.
990295	995296	But, I mean, it's basically like the gymnastics routines and stuff that they do, but just on a pole.
995316	996876	We'll include it in gymnastics.
997336	1002837	But it does require physical strength, and there's a bit of... The ability to spread your legs.
1003678	1003898	No.
1005698	1011899	As someone who took a pole dancing class, it is not just about spreading your legs, all right?
1012319	1014541	Well, I think it should be included under gymnastics.
1016563	1016983	I agree.
1017023	1017904	It should be under there.
1017924	1030715	I mean, because if you can have this stupid gymnastics event where you're prancing around with giant ribbons, then I should be able to, you know... They should have somebody that's, you know, prancing around on a pole.
1030855	1031936	Yeah, if... Look...
1033665	1037049	There's like a ball dance or something where the chicks come out and play with balls.
1037449	1037789	Ribbons.
1038630	1039391	Balls and ribbons.
1039411	1041534	They have one at the ball too.
1041994	1043556	It's like a rhythm ball.
1044197	1044918	It's like Zumba.
1046339	1047641	Bradley, pole dancing?
1047681	1048722	Yes or no in the Olympics?
1049543	1051105	I wonder how they're going to go judging on that.
1054171	1054791	Oh, let's see.
1054871	1057073	The lady from Russia had the most erect nipples.
1057733	1058353	Another one.
1058694	1060895	I mean, to get it out of the gutter here a little bit.
1061675	1063176	Free running would be kind of cool.
1065361	1066602	A lot of the X Games stuff.
1066622	1069903	You know, you put a motorcycle in there and you can't really go wrong.
1070324	1078308	If we just combine the Olympics and the X Games together, maybe that would be kind of like a gymnastics event for the X Games would be like strippers.
1078508	1082870	The problem is pole dancing has that stigma attached to it and it's not classy enough for the Olympics.
1082890	1084371	That's why it would not, you know.
1084471	1087292	I'm sure pole dancing can be done very classily.
1087712	1088192	Classily.
1088372	1088753	Classic.
1089153	1089673	What's a good word?
1090433	1091154	It can be done with class.
1091174	1091594	Not trashy.
1091614	1092114	With class.
1092254	1092675	With class.
1092695	1092935	Of it class.
1092955	1093395	Of it class.
1096232	1123529	I'm not a stripper, I'm a dancer If you're dancing at Cheetah, that is not dancing TigerClaw in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Would love to see games like Super Street Fighter 4 or Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom at the Olympics Those fighting games are super competitive So some disagree with what we're saying Now here's what I agree with This was the statement I agree with 110% which is why the video games aren't going to be in the Olympics Fifth dream
1124309	1124829	Thanks for watching!
1142739	1143460	Well, they can do chess boxing.
1143480	1144381	Not the way I play it.
1145662	1146643	Bitch table!
1148245	1149146	I used to be on the chess team.
1149186	1150467	Table flipping emoticon.
1150868	1152329	Well, it could be chess boxing.
1152449	1154471	That actually is something that people actually do.
1155593	1156774	Wait, is that like beatboxing?
1157094	1161799	It's something they like to play some chess and then they box and then go back and do some more chess.
1162640	1163261	It's battle chess.
1163341	1164842	It's like that biathlon or...
1166864	1169727	It's like the biathlon for... I don't even know what that would be.
1169987	1170988	Chess and boxing?
1171749	1176274	Sophisticated and not sophisticated gaming.
1176354	1177014	I don't know.
1177074	1179056	Blackwolf says full contact chess.
1179377	1180978	Actdeft says extreme chess.
1182000	1184142	I'm gonna take that time clock and shove it up your ass.
1184602	1193170	What about, what about, um... There was an old Saturday Night Live sketch from, like, the 70s with the guy coaching the chess team, and it was all, Ponderick 4!
1193250	1193770	Ponderick 4!
1194411	1194911	No!
1195672	1196513	It's, like, really funny.
1196633	1203158	What about, like, uh... I don't know, um... Some sort of, like, CGing or something like that.
1203178	1206902	You know, let's just start taking stuff from, like, American Gladiators or something.
1207222	1208843	You know, where we have, like, you know...
1209944	1226855	A lot of, you know, they have, you know Fucking Siren and Zap and, you know, Nitro Those were my Olympians back in the day Okay Here we go Here we go The Olympics, I think, should stay to mostly traditional sports Curling should not be an Olympic sport, sorry
1227615	1228616	However... Get out.
1230077	1231698	Curling is like the only thing I'll watch.
1232318	1235621	It's like professional cleaning as an Olympic sport.
1236001	1237562	My mother would love curling.
1237882	1239363	It is exactly what she does.
1239624	1242546	The puck travels down and you follow in front of it with a broom.
1242606	1244387	It's like air hockey on the large scale.
1245328	1246869	Why don't we have Olympic air hockey?
1246889	1248770	That I would vote for.
1248870	1249651	Olympic air hockey.
1251212	1252132	We have ping pong
1273732	1290122	Anyway, but I think that, you know, going back to stuff like the X Games and all the alternative sport things, I think they need to stay in their own kind of venue for the people who are more willing to watch that sort of activity and make pole dancing part of the gymnastic section.
1290600	1291420	What about water skiing?
1291440	1293361	Don't they have like water skiing or something like that?
1293381	1294102	I don't think so.
1294582	1295743	I mean, I don't know what you could do with it.
1295763	1296683	They have like rowing.
1296743	1298024	There are events on the water.
1298324	1304147	There used to be, I think, water ski jumps back in... Are you saying water sports is an Olympic competition?
1304947	1308949	I think back in the day, but like I said, tug-of-war used to be an Olympic sport.
1309949	1311530	Solo synchronized swimming, Rob.
1312391	1315572	Solo synchronized swimming was an Olympic sport.
1315592	1316793	What are you going to synchronize to?
1316893	1319054	I guess it's synchronizing to the music, but you know.
1319554	1320274	I agree with Ranma.
1320314	1321875	Anything goes rhythm gymnastics.
1341383	1346729	So, you know, you have all the diving competitions, but they dive into a ball bin, you know, like a giant ball bin.
1346749	1351174	You just want to put on the pomp and circumstance gown and get up there in front of everybody.
1351214	1353156	May the odds be ever in your favor.
1353216	1353777	Not even.
1354478	1356320	You want to be the Queen of England of these games.
1356460	1356821	Fuck that.
1356901	1357722	I want to be the goddamn queen.
1357742	1359384	She looks like she has diarrhea the whole time.
1359940	1363883	It's the goddamn chairman of the Iron Chef in Japan.
1364043	1364984	Fuck this American Iron Chef.
1365004	1366725	Someone needs to give old Liz a suppository.
1367525	1368586	All right, look.
1368626	1370527	That's her heart for that James Bond thing.
1370587	1371128	I know, right?
1371188	1372309	You know what else used to be a sport?
1372389	1372629	What?
1372829	1373650	Distance diving.
1374710	1378253	As in who could dive the longest distance before having to come up for Eric's...
1378673	1379815	I like Stan in chat.
1379835	1381978	100 meter streaking.
1382378	1382538	Here.
1382979	1384621	Somebody in London participated in that.
1384641	1384881	All right.
1385622	1388767	Takashi's Castle and Ninja Warrior.
1389187	1392291	Those are two perfectly acceptable events in my guess.
1393152	1393473	All right.
1393533	1393953	Look, look.
1393973	1395896	We got to move on from this topic and actually get to video games.
1396136	1400339	I do want to say, I love the comment, and I'm sorry I forgot who said it because it scrolled on by long ago.
1400799	1403661	What about a separate competition for video games?
1404001	1405983	Where is the true video game Olympics?
1406363	1409205	Could we ever see a video game Olympics in our day?
1409705	1412287	Or, I mean, is it kind of already here with eSports?
1413508	1415329	They have the MLG garbage.
1417590	1421033	The views and opinions expressed on this program do not necessarily reflect those.
1421113	1424495	Well, I just don't like the whole MLG as like a
1426607	1426927	I don't know.
1428428	1429169	It's a little weird.
1430369	1431250	I'm cool with MLG.
1431290	1432231	I don't have a beef with them.
1433131	1436233	I want something with the pomp and circumstance of the Olympics.
1436413	1441957	I do want Queen Elizabeth out there going, you know, scowling at everything and judging other countries.
1442677	1443798	I want that for video games.
1443818	1446479	I've decided that this country is the best.
1447060	1447760	Fuck all of you.
1447880	1448240	Fuck off.
1448521	1448841	Fuck off.
1448881	1450482	Like, even if she won't show up, get...
1453404	1455585	Who are the two that just got married?
1455765	1457826	I'm such an ignorant American right now.
1458406	1460488	What, Kate and... Kate and William.
1461008	1463209	Get Kate and William out there, if nothing else.
1463349	1465751	You know, because video games are a younger generation.
1465831	1467332	You know how I always remember them?
1467772	1471234	Because the little boy and witches, his mice were Kate and William.
1473089	1473609	You have issues.
1473629	1474630	Or were they William and Mary?
1475491	1476531	I think they were Kate and... Anyway.
1476632	1477972	We're talking about disc wars.
1478053	1479373	Why don't we have disc wars?
1479594	1481315	Disc golf should be an official sport.
1481335	1484457	You smoke a lot of pot and then try to hit the ball.
1484857	1487499	Tigerclaw in our chatroom says they have the world cyber games.
1488580	1492323	Okay, I have to quote Actdeft here because I have to do the voice from the queen.
1493103	1494024	Bunch of wankers!
1494664	1495205	Alright, look.
1495485	1496105	We gotta move on.
1496225	1497606	I haven't even done announcements.
1497646	1499828	We have a huge show coming up after Orange Monterey.
1499848	1501789	I should do the whole show in a rotten accent.
1501849	1502410	No, you shouldn't.
1503500	1505381	That's my queen voice.
1505661	1512284	Somewhere, Peker Uno and Syl and other British listeners of this program are like crying at our accents.
1512304	1514925	It's because I sound like What's-His-Face from Monty Python when I do it.
1517586	1521007	Every time you talk in a British accent, God throws a crumpet at a kitten.
1522748	1524168	If it was my cat, she wouldn't move.
1524188	1525229	All right.
1525569	1526709	She'd be like, what the hell?
1528310	1528910	Moving on.
1530235	1534581	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the video games we've been playing this week.
1535121	1536283	We'll start with you, DarkSakura.
1536323	1537284	What have you been playing this week?
1537845	1539647	I've been playing lots of Mass Effect.
1540208	1541029	No, I'm not going to do it.
1541674	1543095	I played a crap ton of Mass Effect.
1543295	1556299	And being laid off, I had Pity Day, where I did nothing but look at Garrus fan art, read bad fan fiction, read some good fan fiction, played more Mass Effect, and we did a raid in WoW.
1556659	1558420	We actually raided.
1559440	1560000	It happened.
1560180	1563561	And then I had to go to bed early because of work that I don't have anymore.
1563661	1564742	Damn it, I could have finished the raid.
1566497	1568579	That's the thing that sucks most in retrospect.
1568659	1570140	I could have finished that damn raid.
1570501	1573963	I could have stayed for the whole damn thing, but no.
1575265	1579668	And Dan and I decided to watch some gameplay throughs on some stuff.
1579748	1582671	I mean, we've got the CDX hooked up.
1582871	1585613	I'm so tempted to play through...
1588236	1593702	and put in Robo Alust and play through that again because it's one of my favorite shooters.
1594603	1595684	It's an awesome game.
1596324	1599247	We did watch several playthroughs of full motion video games.
1599808	1605594	We watched Dragon's Lair and Space Ace all the way through.
1607128	1608229	Space Ace, Did You Know, Star Fox, R-Wing
1629145	1630025	Pizza
1656587	1658228	All right, let's go to Bradley.
1658409	1659630	We'll let our guests go next.
1660010	1662312	Bradley, what kind of stuff have you been playing in the past week or so?
1662632	1664514	The main thing I've been playing is Assassin's Creed.
1664534	1666476	It's been sitting up on my shelf for a long time.
1666496	1667637	I said, I want to go play that.
1668818	1674082	That's one of two series I get the most emails about, why aren't you playing this series?
1674122	1676624	And the other is Borderlands, which I finally did start playing.
1676985	1679527	So I've got to get into that at some point.
1679547	1679627	Yeah.
1679847	1689330	Some people kind of get bored with it, at least the first one, just because there's a lot of things you have to do several times, like you have to climb all these towers to get to the top.
1689410	1693712	A lot of things are kind of repetitive, but I'm fine with that.
1693992	1702515	A lot of the big stuff, the acting is pretty good, and actually getting up above the city and looking down is kind of fun.
1703496	1704076	Like your Batman?
1704736	1706337	Thanks for watching!
1729043	1743758	Usually there's like a bunch of people there and you have to wait for them to get to a secluded area but I killed all the guards that were there and then just once you activate that thing you just beat them up right where you started so it makes that little thing a little bit easier to do.
1744438	1748342	Now are you playing these games to kind of set up for the third one that's coming out that's getting a lot of hype?
1749924	1752965	I'm not really worried about that at the moment just because I don't have loads of time to play.
1752985	1760330	I might probably get to two sometime, but just something I wanted to clear for my backlog because I have hundreds of games on the backlog.
1761110	1764032	Another game played was
1764352	1769095	Tetris Axis, which is more Tetris, and various different Tetris modes.
1770235	1773977	Just the bad thing about it is that they don't let you use the circle pad to control.
1773997	1779760	I also played Mole Mania, just the first level of that.
1779840	1783623	It's a classic sort of game that's on the 3DS.
1785344	1788365	It's a classic hard puzzle game sort of thing.
1788485	1789566	I just played the first part of that.
1790166	1794555	and also the other game I got to play was Rhythm Thief, which is a pretty good game.
1796178	1801248	So far I've gone through the first two chapters and all the rhythm games so far have been distinct.
1802850	1806854	I played the demo of that on 3DS and I thought it was cool.
1806934	1808675	Everything seemed to be kind of different.
1808755	1809836	I liked that.
1811018	1816683	It kind of was a throwback a little bit to me to Space Channel 5.
1816763	1821988	Kind of like that zaniness off the wall uniqueness, but kind of like a different play style, which was cool.
1822816	1823716	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
1824837	1825657	It's been good so far.
1826978	1833461	The one silly thing about it is that the dog that follows them around is called Fondue.
1834862	1838204	And they have all these opportunities to make cheese jokes, and they do.
1838224	1839244	Oh, Lord.
1840985	1841445	That's cool.
1841465	1843967	That's definitely an old school Sega title right there, I think.
1844628	1845948	Yeah, and that's about it.
1846088	1848750	And also I've played a little bit of Spelunky.
1848790	1853113	I've been playing that the past few weeks and still haven't beaten the game and I've died about 800 times.
1853954	1858857	It's one of those games that I get really frustrated at at certain times.
1858877	1860098	Just dying left and right.
1860358	1861799	Oh, fuck you, fuck you.
1862860	1867163	I heard the soundtrack's really good to that because I saw something about the soundtrack is out.
1867223	1869704	It's a pay what you want thing, but as long as you pay at least $7.
1871165	1871766	Yeah, it's pretty good.
1871806	1877169	I think I've heard that the XBLA version is different from the original, like the PC version.
1877189	1878470	Interesting.
1878710	1880372	So I think people might like the PC version.
1880392	1881612	That might be from the PC version.
1881853	1883554	And I think people like the PC version better.
1884314	1885795	But I haven't heard the PC.
1885815	1887777	I haven't tried that one yet, though, on the PC.
1889013	1889313	All right.
1890453	1896855	Well, if that's it, before I go to Loki, because Loki I know has a big week we got to get into, I'm going to go next because mine's actually really quick.
1897796	1901297	As far as new games go, there's really only one new game I got to try this week.
1901637	1902897	Played a lot of the same old stuff.
1902937	1905998	You know, I played World of Warcraft, played some Mass Effect multiplayer and all that good stuff.
1906638	1910960	One new game I tried over the weekend because it's having a free weekend is a new MMO called The Secret World.
1912900	1918521	It's an MMO, obviously, and it's set a little more in the modern-day world.
1918581	1928644	It's more of a modern-day MMO with the whole zombie element to it and cyberpunk kind of a twist on it.
1929484	1930104	So it's kind of cool.
1930144	1939766	It's one of the first MMOs I've played in a very long time where I didn't sit there going, oh, this is a lot like WoW, or oh, I'm looking for the WoW influence, or oh, I see that they took this from WoW.
1940186	1945769	And keep in mind, I usually kind of have that eye because I have been playing World of Warcraft for so long and, you know, have the podcast and everything.
1946089	1948090	That's how I approach a lot of games, or MMOs.
1948670	1951011	But Secret World really didn't remind me of WoW at all.
1951091	1958935	The combat was really fast-paced, which, you know, another friend of mine was playing it and it kind of irritated him, but I kind of liked the combat.
1959455	1962697	I also liked that there was no leveling.
1963237	1964037	Thank you for watching!
1982182	1995433	So, I mean, that was kind of fun to play, and the different environment leads way to a different set of quests and all that, and a different type of story, and yeah, I gotta say, I was feeling it, but I'm gonna tell you what I'm not feeling.
1996514	1997114	It's the price.
1997615	2000597	Because if I wanna play Beyond this weekend, I'm gonna have to pay $50 for the game.
2001738	2002459	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2031821	2053152	Which I understand, yes, World of Warcraft sells those mounts and those pets I've never bought one that wasn't for charity But those things also don't give you an edge in the game And I was a little put off by that And honestly, I think it's happening to every other MMO As we're going to get into later this week I think it's just a matter of time before Secret World goes free to play Or gets a price reduction So you know what?
2053552	2054473	I'm just going to wait until then
2055316	2060059	I did enjoy what I played of it, but if it's going to go the way of every other MMO, sorry.
2060199	2069004	I know that that might give me some stink eye from developers and things like that, but I didn't love it enough to just jump on board and support it.
2069445	2070985	That's where I was with it.
2071446	2076109	And SSJ100Matt in chat says, yeah, but Rob, didn't Blizzard sell useless mounts?
2076189	2076869	Correct, they do.
2077289	2077990	And I don't like it.
2078590	2080851	I gotta admit, I don't like that they do that.
2081311	2082232	I don't buy those mounts.
2082252	2085653	I think $25 or whatever they charge for a mount, I think it's ridiculous.
2087354	2093217	However, once in a while Blizzard will put out a $10 pet where it all goes to charity or something like that.
2093697	2094437	I'm okay with that.
2094477	2095258	That's a lot different.
2096178	2101420	Those I have bought, but I've never bought a mount for the $25 or whatever.
2101440	2102561	I just think that's a little silly.
2103221	2108343	and I also think they charge way too much for the server transfers and WoW has other pricing issues too.
2108623	2121027	The cost to enter the game right now between buying the Battle Chest, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm and soon Pandaria, it's ridiculous and that's why WoW is losing subscribers but I'll get into that a little later in the show.
2121747	2136658	for now that's it for my gaming week Loki, Loki, Loki, Loki alright, so I read Twitter and I listen to this show so I know you took the day off work on Wednesday, right?
2136979	2138540	so you could stay up Tuesday night
2138860	2139381	and DarkSakura.com.
2160240	2161280	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2184756	2196884	So immediately I was greeted with, you know, the next page and they're talking about how, you know, how, you know, the third gate contest and basically, you know, here it was.
2197625	2200387	So Ready Player One Easter Egg Hunt, the third gate.
2200447	2207932	To complete the third challenge in the RP1 Easter Egg Contest, you must, and this is where I was like, what?
2208552	2213576	You must set a new world record high score on one of the following classic video games.
2215077	2221202	Robotron 2084, Joust, Black Tiger, and Tempest.
2222863	2230269	Now, since then, they've added Joust on the Atari 2600 and Pac-Man, but all the rest are arcade versions.
2231189	2232771	So, basically...
2234660	2235280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2249608	2250408	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2274880	2298725	and then of course it goes into a little bit detail what you need to do basically this is tied in with Twin Galaxies you have to follow their submission rules and stuff and I haven't really played around with Twin Galaxies that much because I kind of roll my eyes every time I hear about Twin Galaxies but their submissions are ridiculous basically you have to so here's the challenge number one
2300270	2303351	Pick a game that you're going to somehow get the world record to.
2303991	2306412	Well, actually, even before that, find an arcade.
2308353	2314095	Number two, find an arcade that has classic games because classic games don't bring in money to arcades anymore so they don't have them anymore.
2315791	2339705	Number three, find an arcade with a classic game that happens to be nearby because there's not a lot of them that's also willing to allow you to stay there for long hours and open up their arcade machine and film the inside of their arcade machine as well as you playing the game without any sort of interruptions from little kids or something jumping in the way, knocking over your camera equipment and all that other stuff.
2340906	2341967	And that's even before...
2343673	2344033	and DarkSakura.com.
2369901	2372483	I mean, it's just... Here's my disappointment.
2372583	2381629	I understand that, you know, he's basically saying, okay, well, this is the type of competition stuff that was in Ready Player One The Vote.
2381669	2384070	Okay, well, let's back up for a second.
2384431	2387953	Okay, the first gate was an Atari 2600 game.
2388033	2391355	An original Atari 2600 game they made specifically for this gate.
2391455	2399101	That was cool, because it tied in with the game, and it was challenging, but it wasn't like, oh, my God, this is impossible to beat.
2400101	2404163	Number two, and granted, these are all supposed to be increasing in challenge each time.
2404223	2405504	Number two was not a challenge at all.
2405604	2406604	It was a Facebook game.
2406664	2411666	The only challenge was my patience in playing a Facebook game that was basically pay to win.
2411886	2414127	I want to point something out, though, between that first and second gate.
2414187	2416589	That first gate, you have the classic.
2416629	2417449	You have the old.
2417509	2419710	You have the history of video games right there.
2419750	2426373	I mean, granted, it's not like Space War or something like that, but for all practical purposes, Atari 2600 is about as far back as most our gaming memories go.
2426773	2429555	and then for the second gate you had the most modern thing.
2429595	2432897	I mean, love it or hate it, Facebook is gaming right now.
2432937	2443584	The only reason that it was tied in with it because it was Richard Garriott, the guy that was behind Ultima, a pretty classic series.
2443945	2453491	Granted, I would have thought the Ultima MMO that they're beta testing or something like that would have been better fit for this, but whatever.
2453551	2455873	Facebook game where you collect vintage stuff.
2457074	2458515	Fine, but it was annoying.
2459096	2460097	It wasn't difficult though.
2460177	2464322	There was absolutely no skill involved in it at all other than click, click, click.
2465243	2466765	Alright, crap, I ran out of energy.
2467186	2468147	Gotta wait for more energy.
2468607	2469348	Click, click, click.
2469508	2469849	Oh, crap.
2470177	2470897	Oh, I don't want to wait anymore.
2470917	2471798	I'm going to pay for more energy.
2471878	2473879	I mean, that's really the only skill that was involved there.
2474339	2477181	To, oh, hey, by the way, you got to set a fucking world record.
2477341	2479282	I mean, that's a little like, woof.
2479582	2481943	Like, what the hell kind of a difficulty curve is that?
2482463	2483744	I mean, that's a little ridiculous.
2484304	2496931	Now, to be fair, you know, like I said, this sort of kind of ties in with, you know, the book and, you know, how, well, you know, the main character in the book, he played a perfect game of Pac-Man and stuff like that.
2497511	2499032	And, you know, oh, cool, you know.
2499392	2518167	but you have to understand in the book these people were this guy leaves his fortune of billions of dollars billions of dollars and these people have to find these Easter eggs to get this vast amount of fortune so they become experts in everything 80s including playing arcade games
2519147	2520107	All of their free time.
2520348	2522708	And we're talking people just playing games.
2523048	2532111	And the reason that that main character goes in the first place to an arcade museum and plays that Pac-Man machine is because he likes playing Pac-Man.
2532131	2538312	It's not because, oh shit, I gotta play this Pac-Man machine perfectly so I can get this whatever to open another gate.
2538413	2540193	It didn't even have anything to do with the other gate.
2540753	2542914	But it's just because he enjoys playing these games.
2542974	2543074	But
2544054	2554720	Now, forcing people to play these arcade games and get world record, you're not targeting your audience of people that enjoy 80s stuff and read your book and like the book.
2554880	2558162	You're targeting people that play arcade games hardcore, and that's it.
2559085	2565172	All right, let me... Since it's only a three-hour show, Loki, let me throw some tough questions at you.
2566073	2568696	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2569196	2571779	The guy apparently doesn't want to make it easy for someone to get his car.
2572180	2573321	You knew it wasn't going to be easy.
2573841	2576645	I didn't think it was going to be easy, but I thought it was going to be a little bit more original.
2576745	2576905	Like,
2577285	2585972	You know, let's get the guy that created, you know, fucking, I want to be the guy to create some new custom game that ties in with the series and it's fucking hard.
2586333	2586973	I don't mind that.
2587033	2592518	That would have been fair because it would have been something unique that, oh, this is challenging, but I just have to be skilled enough to do it.
2592698	2594460	The thing that, you know, and I got to say it,
2595140	2596502	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2611201	2613642	is not something everybody can accomplish.
2613742	2615242	It's kind of an uneven playing field.
2615382	2616762	I'm not even talking about gaming skill.
2617163	2626045	I'm just talking about access to these games because, yeah, to find an original machine, there's only so many arcades in the nation that even have something like that.
2626145	2630686	And if you're like, you might be the most hardcore gaming fan in the world and you live in Montana.
2631066	2631786	You're fucked.
2632086	2632847	Not necessarily.
2633387	2636568	I mean, I don't know of any big classic gaming arcades in Montana.
2636628	2637548	Excuse me if I'm wrong.
2638268	2641169	but you're going to have to find an independent game collector.
2641509	2646410	You're going to have to be like John Jacobson from Video Game Outsiders who has the arcade in his basement.
2646430	2647710	You've got to know somebody like that.
2647850	2648690	Not necessarily.
2649591	2661794	Any of those places will rent out classic games to pizza parlors, to mom and pop places, to restaurants in general, skating rinks.
2663014	2667635	The skating rink I went to in Dothan, Alabama since I was a little kid had the same damn frogger there
2669261	2674026	Even when I went as an adult, the same Frogger I played since it was brand fucking new.
2675187	2676228	Just saying, you can find them.
2677309	2691021	Okay, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it's not like, you know, hey, any of these challenges where it's, okay, here's the ROM or here's the game that you can play in a flash, you know, in the browser, and everybody has access to it.
2691061	2694064	This is like, okay, find arcade game and play it.
2694244	2695065	And, you know...
2697626	2700429	He keeps adding more stuff to this.
2700489	2706355	And he's supposed to be adding more games each week.
2706756	2708958	And that's the thing too that I also don't like.
2708978	2711480	Because these rules keep getting fucking tweaked every time.
2711781	2714403	And that's what shows me it wasn't thought out.
2714704	2719368	Because they're having to consistently tweak the rules because they're realizing, oh fuck, we did make this impossible.
2720489	2721330	Here's my other question for you.
2721830	2726613	It seems like there's some good sportsmanship and camaraderie amongst all the people who have gone far in this competition, right?
2726653	2728434	Like, you guys are all talking to each other and stuff?
2728494	2729054	Some people, yeah.
2729074	2729274	Sort of?
2729594	2732536	Like, what's been the reaction overall?
2732636	2733997	Like, is everybody pissed like you?
2734137	2737079	Or are there some people that are like, alright, now this is a contest.
2738220	2740923	There are some people that are kind of like kiss asses like that.
2741684	2742805	That's my opinion at least.
2743266	2748292	That are like, well, I think this is a perfect contest, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2748372	2750515	But like, I'll read some examples.
2750555	2755941	Like one of the posts or whatever on Planet Lotus, which is one of the websites that's kind of dedicated to all this stuff.
2756682	2756802	Um...
2757923	2782545	and I laughed when I saw it because it was is basically the thread topic was you've got to be kidding me and then you know the post seriously and then you know the next ones well nobody's gonna beat it tonight haha man I live in it I live in the country it's gonna be tough finding an actual working arcade I bet collector has these um arcades are gonna be bombarded and um what was it uh
2784198	2784959	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2800078	2807144	You know, what's to say they're not going to go, oh hey, I'm just going to play these really fucking easy games and cool, I got a DeLorean now too.
2807164	2809066	We're going to see Billy Mitchell with a DeLorean.
2809246	2809747	End of story.
2809787	2811488	I think that's exactly what's going to end up happening.
2812009	2818594	I think one of the existing record holders is going to get wind of this if they haven't already and it's just going to motivate them to break their existing record and it's over.
2818614	2820496	I hope it's that guy that plays with his feet though.
2820596	2821096	That'd be awesome.
2822369	2823849	But, see, that's fucking lame.
2823969	2828751	And here's the other thing, too, is they've also, like I said, they keep adding and changing the rules.
2829251	2837233	They put in a thing now, well, if the third gate's not completed by October 1st, you know, check back to this page.
2837273	2839994	We may have a fourth gate, or we may just end the contest.
2840634	2841154	It's just like...
2842927	2843227	Really?
2843347	2844968	I mean, you're going to do this crap?
2846409	2849371	Here's the problem, though, and I'm trying to make this short, but here's the problem.
2849711	2851532	I'm torn because I don't want to quit.
2851832	2853173	I don't want to quit now.
2853954	2860197	But at the same time, I don't want to invest in the stuff that I need to in order to complete it.
2860257	2862599	Like, for example, I have an arcade machine at home.
2862839	2865901	It's just a main cabinet, but it's an arcade machine.
2865961	2867762	I pop that computer out of there.
2867962	2868823	It's a JAMMA cabinet.
2868843	2870284	I can pop any JAMMA game in there.
2871323	2900014	I wanted to play Black Tiger there was a whole bunch of drama behind that too because there's a conspiracy that the Black Tiger machine that the guy used to complete the world record was somehow not necessarily modified maybe he didn't know it was modified but that it was a hybrid machine meaning it had some of the chips from Black Tiger and it had some of the chips from Black Dragon which is the Japanese version of the game and the Japanese version scores differently than the US version
2900974	2901875	which may have caused that.
2901995	2911321	Of course, Twin Galaxies approved it and said, no, it's legit, but they're doing it off of video.
2912022	2915024	If it's not legit, are they really going to go back and go, oh, we made a mistake?
2915264	2915764	I don't think so.
2915824	2917305	I don't think that they're going to at this point.
2918126	2919087	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2933163	2934684	Cool, that you're into arcade games.
2934704	2935264	Where does he live?
2936044	2936844	I have no fucking clue.
2936985	2937525	Yeah, I understand.
2937545	2938305	Go play at his house.
2938665	2945588	But, you know, I'm actually thinking about buying a Black Tiger arcade board.
2945608	2946468	Oh my god.
2946688	2946908	But...
2949329	2955870	See, the thing is, though, is I don't want to... Black Tiger, though, like I said, the high score on it is millions... You are being such a boy right now.
2955930	2960111	You are being such a boy right now where you do not want to give up on this.
2960171	2963332	You are just... I know I'm not going to stop and ask for directions.
2964272	2965652	I'm going to beat this, damn it.
2967393	2973434	And then you're going to get cut off at the knees by one of these guys that already holds the world record and you're going to be three times as pissed as you are tonight.
2973674	2974134	I know.
2974714	2976535	I've known you for ten plus years.
2976575	2977755	That's exactly what's going to happen.
2978928	2979748	Hey, I understand that.
2979788	2980449	That's possible.
2980569	2982029	Oh, yeah, and then, of course, the Pac-Man world record.
2982049	2983590	You have to beat the time.
2984030	2985191	We're already 50 minutes in.
2985391	2987692	I've got to bring this to a close, but I have to ask this, okay?
2988592	2991574	And we have a show following us tonight, so we can't have a marathon show tonight.
2991674	2992654	But I've got to ask this.
2993254	2993915	Twitter drama.
2994275	3004479	Because I've got to say, Loki, you were a little bit ranny pants on Twitter, and you went so far to say, fuck you, Ernie Klein, which did strike me as a little bit angry 12-year-old.
3004599	3005680	But, okay, you're mad.
3005740	3006140	Whatever.
3006160	3006320	Whatever.
3007761	3008702	What's going on on Twitter?
3008962	3011004	You get angry and he follows you?
3011804	3012525	I guess, yeah.
3014386	3016187	But you know what?
3016347	3022452	I've tweeted him before because he did a video talking about his DeLorean that he's given up.
3023192	3025514	And he misquoted himself.
3025574	3026655	He said, oh yeah, it's got 249,000 miles.
3026675	3026915	And I'm like...
3029699	3030280	Thanks for watching!
3044801	3048384	Dude, you've put fucking 6,000 miles on it in like a few months.
3049284	3049765	Here's the thing.
3049885	3054408	And Bobby and Chad are saying, is the Black Tiger arcade board cheaper than a tricked out DeLorean?
3054829	3056530	You guys don't understand, Loki.
3056890	3059772	It doesn't matter at this point because now it's a thing.
3060293	3061534	It's become a thing.
3061954	3063495	And now it doesn't matter anymore, folks.
3063615	3066097	It doesn't matter if the value of that board is greater.
3066638	3067258	It's a thing.
3069380	3070040	Am I right, Loki?
3070060	3070361	It's a thing.
3070381	3070841	It's a thing.
3072182	3072982	I just want to win.
3073643	3073923	See?
3077505	3078585	That's exactly it.
3080466	3084988	Personally, I would want to try Robotron, but finding a Williams machine is like near impossible.
3086875	3097800	Alright, so... Other things, I played Minecraft, I played Call of Duty, and... Oh, I did play Black Tiger a little bit, because that's what I did that night when I got pissed off.
3097840	3099061	I'm like, fuck this shit.
3099161	3103623	I'm just going to boot up my cabinet and play Black Tiger a little bit, because I haven't really played that.
3103963	3104964	And that's the other thing, too.
3105024	3107685	If you're going to grade this world record, I think a lot of these people will do it.
3107865	3109866	Don't just say, I just want to hold the world record.
3110386	3111647	They enjoy playing that game.
3111887	3113428	I don't enjoy playing Black Tiger.
3114068	3114248	But...
3115444	3115744	I don't know.
3115824	3116765	We'll see what they add.
3116885	3117325	I don't know.
3117345	3121427	There's not really... I don't think... All of them are going to be breaking world records, so I don't think anyone's going to do it.
3121467	3132373	And to be honest, he said so far, he has four... Because one of the first things you have to do is you take a picture of the machine that you're going to attempt the thing on, and you send them also your pictures that you took for the first two gates.
3132993	3145159	He's had... There's almost 1,200 people that passed the first gate, 725 that passed the second gate, five that have emailed him a picture for the third gate so far that even say they're attempting...
3145424	3147925	GameGuru says just buy the damn DeLorean.
3148106	3148346	Nope.
3148706	3149366	I'm sorry, buddy.
3149586	3150227	It's a thing.
3150827	3151548	That's what you're missing.
3151948	3153769	It's not about the DeLorean anymore.
3154029	3154890	That's the problem.
3156150	3157211	It's a manual DeLorean.
3157331	3161013	It's a manual car that sucks gas.
3161033	3162274	You can't even drive a manual.
3162314	3163335	I can't drive a manual.
3163355	3163695	God damn you.
3163715	3167917	It sucks gas, and it can only be repaired in Southern California.
3169338	3171359	But you still want it.
3171700	3172020	Yes.
3172040	3172240	Yes.
3174929	3178711	That's gotta be the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.
3179051	3179611	It is him.
3181452	3182773	You are... Buy one!
3183113	3184553	You'll spend less money.
3185274	3185774	No, I won't.
3185934	3188715	DarkSakura, how long have you known this man?
3189075	3190016	He's not gonna get it.
3190076	3191076	That's not the answer.
3191216	3192037	No one's gonna win it.
3192237	3194638	I don't want to give away my DeLorean anyway, man.
3196047	3197689	Alright, we're talking in circles.
3198570	3200052	Anything else for your gaming week, Loki?
3201093	3202675	I just want to win so I can punch him in the face.
3205418	3206440	You are so mature.
3206820	3212327	Thank you for exuding the maturity that hosts of this show should have all over the internet.
3212347	3213388	Fuck you, Ernie Klein.
3213868	3214689	Oh, you're following me?
3214769	3215070	Shit.
3217785	3219185	Actdeft is right, it's time for an intervention
3242902	3244944	It's like I'm walking on sunshine.
3245225	3247567	It's just frustrating, okay?
3247807	3249929	It's like I've put this much effort into it so far.
3250010	3253954	I don't want to quit right now, even though it's ridiculous.
3254894	3255735	It's ridiculous.
3256376	3262502	I mean, playing a 2600 game, playing a Facebook game, world record!
3262803	3265185	We got passed by something cooler than a DeLorean last night.
3267099	3270483	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3287541	3289802	Fencer because it has fucking swords in it.
3289862	3291223	That makes perfect sense.
3291523	3293644	That's going to really narrow down your fan base.
3293664	3294645	You have to bring the one ring.
3294865	3298807	And Loki will be the chick from South Korea that's sitting on the platform crying.
3301543	3302423	That's how this ends.
3302623	3304945	I am almost considering... Let me put it this way.
3304965	3306866	I'm not putting much effort into this right now.
3308447	3324417	And I'm not buying a Black Tiger arcade board right now, but I'm just saying I will play it casually, and if I see that, okay, look, I figured out something that no one else has figured out on it, and I can get a high score that can beat the world record, then sure, yes, I will do all that and film all that stuff.
3324437	3325218	But at the same time...
3327179	3329961	I don't, I just don't have the time.
3330201	3331702	I don't have the time to do this.
3334283	3339286	Loki, you just played 67 hours of joust in an attempt to win a used car.
3339366	3340687	Yes, that's another thing.
3340887	3341268	67 hours!
3341508	3343169	Who the fuck's gonna do that?
3343949	3348592	You just played 67 hours of joust in an attempt to win a used car.
3348692	3349553	How do you feel?
3349573	3351574	I'm walking on sunshine.
3354508	3354789	67 hours?
3354909	3357510	Yeah, that's how long it takes for Joust.
3358451	3358651	No.
3361813	3364334	Hey, it's a historical night here at VOG Network.
3365235	3367777	www.vognetwork.com The Voice.
3368157	3376362	Twin Galaxies wanted to remind everybody that if you do break the world record before September 5th, you get to be in the Guinness Book this year of gaming.
3377242	3380144	Speaking of Twin Galaxies, let's talk about space.
3380304	3381105	Can I talk about space?
3381325	3381785	Talking about space.
3381865	3382366	Alright, space.
3382426	3382746	I'm in space.
3383346	3384527	Are you the best at space?
3384667	3384867	Yes.
3385327	3388028	No, Travis Donovan tonight at VOG Network is the best at space.
3388328	3394051	He is going to be hosting live after our program tonight, the Mars Curiosity Landing Special.
3394491	3400274	Now, for those that don't know, the thing they shot in space, like how long ago was that?
3400294	3402195	It was probably almost like seven years ago at this point.
3402235	3403915	Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine.
3404316	3404436	Yeah.
3404556	3405176	Oh, it was that day?
3406852	3407012	No.
3407992	3408593	Portal reference.
3409413	3410113	You have issues.
3410173	3410413	All right.
3410834	3415015	So they shot this guy into space, and it's landing on Mars tonight.
3415075	3418096	But it's happening late at night, like 1.30 a.m.
3418176	3419757	in the morning Eastern Coast time.
3420057	3422418	But Travis Donovan, he loves his NASA.
3422658	3423958	He loves his space program.
3424178	3424899	And God bless him.
3424939	3432001	He's going to stay up late tonight to talk about what this all means and go over the live landing with all of you guys.
3432061	3433742	And kind of, I mean, for some people...
3434102	3435844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3456381	3459043	I don't know what he plans to do as far as archive and all that stuff.
3459384	3459884	I'm hoping.
3459944	3465069	Just stay tuned to VOGnetwork.com if you can't listen live tonight and there will be something later on.
3465369	3468471	But if you do participate live tonight, there's special loot in it for you.
3468952	3469732	So check that out.
3469973	3472975	The Mars Curiosity starts at 10 p.m.
3473075	3474576	Pacific, 1 a.m.
3474697	3475818	Eastern thereabouts.
3475938	3481082	He's probably just going to take over when we go off air tonight, which at the rate we're going will be around 1 a.m.
3481162	3481903	Eastern time.
3482563	3483844	How about we just continue?
3484064	3485844	How about we get into some gaming news?
3486524	3489385	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, Twitter.com slash OLR.
3489706	3492166	Congratulations, Critical Myth, on your 200th episode.
3492987	3495187	That is also something that's going on at VOG Network this week.
3495307	3495948	I'll make you a logo.
3497908	3499529	Don't go with the papyrus thing right now.
3499869	3502330	Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 4 p.m.
3502390	3503730	Pacific, 7 p.m.
3503810	3504170	Eastern.
3504491	3506691	Dark Sakura will make you a new logo as a present.
3506711	3508332	I will make you a new logo for free.
3510582	3510782	No.
3511903	3513564	Papyrus is the devil.
3513584	3514944	Stop.
3514964	3515985	Be respectful of everybody.
3516005	3518967	I'm respectful, but Papyrus... You're being generous.
3519247	3519947	I'm being generous.
3520107	3521328	I'm saving you from yourself.
3521348	3522248	You have to understand, this is 2012.
3522288	3525170	Papyrus is the new Comic Sans.
3525230	3525470	Alright.
3527651	3528271	It doesn't matter.
3528311	3529192	It's not about that.
3529252	3534393	It's about the in-depth, and I mean in-depth, television critiques that they do every week.
3534413	3536014	And they're very mindful about spoilers.
3536074	3537334	They're very good about all of that.
3537754	3538374	So check it out.
3539055	3540495	I don't even know what they have planned.
3540535	3543156	Apparently there's a special guest coming on for the 200th episode.
3543496	3544236	That's going to be awesome.
3544276	3547998	That starts tomorrow night at VOG Network, Monday, 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern.
3548358	3552499	Congrats, you guys, on your 200th episode, even if Jamie would like to question your font choices.
3553482	3553882	You know what?
3554743	3555784	Congratulations to them.
3558246	3561789	It's just, Papyrus is like crack cocaine.
3562089	3562669	Alright, it's fine.
3562770	3565472	You know, it may look pretty, but it's really bad for you.
3565632	3568734	I'm gonna make an Orange Lounge radio logo in Comic Sans and see how that goes over.
3568754	3570456	You do that, and I will judge you forever.
3571276	3572738	Alright, gaming news!
3573478	3574099	Jeez!
3574739	3575060	Loki.
3575380	3577622	So, Star Wars The Elder Republic's going free-to-play.
3578682	3579283	Um, well...
3581124	3584546	It'll transition to a hybrid free-to-play, is what they're calling it.
3585066	3590810	Basically, they're going to allow a major portion of the game to be free, including the first 50 levels in all eight classes.
3591190	3595453	Of course, there's going to be restrictions and microtransactions to go with that.
3596273	3601657	If you do subscribe to the game, you will be given currency each month called cartel coins.
3601697	3604738	You can buy customized gear and other items.
3605099	3610522	Also, you'll get other special rewards if you're a different subscriber.
3611262	3616946	They basically said that they want to give people flexibility.
3616986	3620248	So if you want to do a subscription, you can do that.
3620368	3623971	Otherwise, you can not.
3624731	3629975	And of course, apparently, the numbers have been dipping a little bit.
3631176	3632657	The people who actually subscribe to it.
3633037	3634598	They've sold 2 million copies.
3634818	3639001	However, right now, there's only less than a million people actually playing.
3640706	3642867	So that's not very good.
3642887	3645349	There's tons of people playing for it who aren't paying for it.
3645489	3648091	Or are they doing that whole free... Isn't it already free to play?
3648131	3649211	Did you say playing for it?
3649432	3649692	Whatever.
3650152	3650973	Free to play to level 15 or 20?
3651073	3651713	Yeah, it's below 20.
3651753	3652133	I know that.
3652173	3652794	It's either 10 or 15.
3658457	3663581	But I think free-to-play will definitely help their numbers, so that's kind of cool.
3663761	3671106	I mean, I just think that a lot of people maybe didn't like the game, and so they just stopped playing.
3671146	3672447	It's not necessarily that they're so painful.
3672467	3673067	It's not Mass Effect.
3673968	3676889	Well, it's a really good single player game.
3677349	3681571	I don't think there was enough cutting edge content for the multiplayer was the problem.
3682191	3689273	And for me, PvP ran really sluggish and I have a pretty high end computer so it made it a lot less fun to play.
3689393	3694295	I liked a lot of ideas in the game and the storytelling was done really well.
3695035	3700182	But I just think it was a game that had about three months worth of content.
3700603	3702365	That's about how long it lasted, unfortunately.
3702926	3706911	It's a tough, highly competitive marketplace right now.
3708513	3711457	I think people give too much credit to the fact that it's Star Wars.
3712337	3740254	it doesn't matter folks that's what gets that's what will draw people in for that first taste that and the fact that it's Bioware and that Knights of the Old Republic has a good history behind it that's what draws people in but it ain't gonna make people stay and I think people put way too much stock into this just because it's Star Wars it's not like everything Star Wars related has always been golden cough cough Christmas special cough cough prequels right true
3742583	3744304	I mean, yeah, Star Wars is a great movie.
3744364	3748066	The original Disney trilogy.
3748246	3748566	All right.
3749726	3752268	I just want to piggyback on this real quick before I go into the next story.
3752348	3753528	Did you hear about World of Warcraft?
3753728	3756029	Because it's not like things are all roses over there either.
3756049	3757570	I heard that their numbers are dropping too.
3757610	3760912	Their numbers dropped to 9.1 million as reported at the...
3762012	3762753	Oh, boo-hoo.
3762853	3763953	Expectations this week.
3764334	3779883	Well, for a game that had 12 million subscribers, that is supposedly at the pinnacle shining MMO, a 25% loss, which is what that essentially equates to gradually over the past year, that is something that makes investors go, oh, really?
3779943	3780964	The game is kind of expensive.
3780984	3782165	Wait till Pandaria, then.
3782865	3799999	the biggest problem with World of Warcraft and I've said this until I am blue in the face on a horde house and Blizzard Activision pulled your head out of your ass on this I swear to god this is what's holding the game back and I don't know why they can't see it the cost to enter the game is too big
3801340	3827937	every other game consolidates the expansions into the original game at some point Warcraft has done it once with what's going on a fifth expansion that's unacceptable it's not working I realize they put the expansions on sale once in a great while I'm sorry if that sale is not sitting on the target shelf you're not going to draw in new players it is time for them to consolidate Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm into the original battle chest sell it for $19.99 or you will never
3830399	3831459	Get more subscribers.
3831499	3834180	So what happens if you don't have those expansions?
3834300	3835440	Do you just not get the play?
3835500	3836300	You play to level 65.
3837040	3839181	You play to level 70.
3839481	3841201	Because Burning Crusade is included now.
3841261	3841982	They finally did that.
3842002	3843522	Well, when I started Burning Crusade wasn't.
3844002	3845882	Well, when I went back, Burning Crusade wasn't.
3845942	3847083	No, that was more of a recent change.
3847103	3847763	I bought them all.
3848423	3850423	But, I mean, it sucks that you had to do that.
3850623	3853364	And, you know, it takes a special kind of crazy to do that.
3853604	3857756	However, I've found places that sold everything for less than retail.
3858859	3860865	Not much less than retail, but less than retail.
3861346	3861907	I love you fries.
3863342	3868887	But still, I mean, you know, if they really want to attract new subscribers, $19.99 for the game.
3868907	3874793	But for some reason, sell $19.99 for the base game and then charge for the Mists of Pandaria expansion or whatever.
3874873	3878716	But, you know, the reason why it's not working is people want to play with their friends.
3879077	3882660	And they have this whole recruit a friend program that will get you to level 80 real quick.
3882720	3886543	You can't get to level 80 without buying at least the first expansion.
3887124	3887504	Hello?
3888605	3913006	there's a total logic fail going on here and they need to fix it so Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says well 9 million plus subscribers is still respectable it is that's why this isn't quite the doom and gloom I mean show me another MMO that's anywhere close to that that's not called lineage let me rephrase show me one in the states that's anywhere near close to that level of hysteria that World of Warcraft is
3916076	3918778	Panaxium in our chatroom says, I was going to play with a friend.
3919078	3920499	He saw all he had to buy.
3920679	3921780	We played something else.
3923241	3924702	My point exactly.
3925122	3925663	Exactly.
3925703	3927184	Well, here's what I did.
3927684	3929986	I mean, and you know this.
3930366	3934729	I had already had Burning Crusade like early on because I did play it back in the day.
3935570	3942215	But I played all the way up until I hit level 70 and then that night I went out and got Wrath of the Lich King.
3943886	3964857	and all you were doing with these expansions was paying to level you don't even I mean that's what Blizzard doesn't get nobody is running the old raids anymore hello except us well because we're doing them because they're fun it's a little different and you're doing them with over leveled characters which is really fun because I like you know overkill
3965959	3995366	but I mean you know I did my I actually got 1 to 85 pretty much by myself except for saying hey Rob help me kill this guy well it's nice that you can solo so much of the content you know yeah there is a lot of it that you can solo and you can go in and go back and do other quests low level quests and get more of the story which is what I was doing for the longest time alright I don't want to turn this into the Warcraft podcast but I will close with this comment from our chat room live.vognetwork.com I wouldn't want to compete with Horde House
3995946	3998968	SSJ100 Matt says, Blizzard needs a rude awakening.
3999068	4004312	I think Diablo 3 was the start, but they won't change their tactics without getting hit in the pocketbooks.
4004833	4010797	I agree with you with 90% of that statement that I would change the word Blizzard to Activision.
4011277	4012618	And now I agree with that statement.
4012958	4013399	Think about it.
4014319	4016921	Everything started going downhill when?
4018282	4018723	Think about it.
4019683	4022344	Alright, moving on with other gaming news.
4022424	4025505	Hopefully this won't be downhill for Nintendo because that could be bad.
4025645	4034988	Nintendo needs the Wii U to be successful this holiday season and we may have some of the details thanks to an apparent GameStop leak.
4037074	4037855	See, here's the thing.
4037995	4038755	I'm reporting this.
4038915	4039976	I don't write the news.
4040396	4046038	I'm reporting this, bringing it up for discussion because it's circulating all the blogs out there.
4046378	4048379	I kind of don't think this is news, personally.
4049020	4050300	But I want to get your thought.
4050360	4051781	I mean, here's the deal.
4052481	4058645	GameStop apparently got marketing materials for the Wii U that talk about what games are going to come out when.
4058885	4062908	And it outlines all of the different publishers and when the games are coming out.
4063348	4066130	And for example, the first party stuff from Nintendo.
4066631	4068672	Lego City Undercover, holiday.
4069012	4069993	New Super Mario Bros.
4070133	4070913	U, holiday.
4071214	4073175	Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge, holiday.
4073415	4074636	Nintendo Land, holiday.
4074916	4075957	Sing, holiday.
4076457	4088920	Wii U, Panorama View, I didn't even know about that one, Holiday, Game and Wario, Launch Window, Pikmin 3, Launch Window, Project P100, Launch Window, and Wii Fit U, Launch Window.
4089180	4089920	What's that tell us?
4090280	4090900	Not a lot.
4091500	4092620	It doesn't tell us dates.
4093000	4098461	It doesn't tell us which of those games will be available on the actual day and which ones are closer to December 25th.
4098802	4105103	But I mean, it's not like there's going to be that much time between the time this system releases and Christmas anyway.
4105523	4105723	So
4106644	4113012	And I kind of was like, I thought we already knew if you listen to the way they delivered that keynote.
4113452	4118659	I thought we already knew Pikmin 3 will be out the same day as the Wii U. We know that.
4120487	4123909	WeFitU, I think we had a good feeling was going to hit that same day too.
4124010	4125791	And we kind of knew Super Mario Bros.
4125851	4126571	U. WeFitU where?
4127012	4127232	What?
4127492	4128253	WeFitU where?
4128553	4129193	That's what it's called.
4129513	4130474	And New Super Mario Bros.
4130614	4131975	U was coming out after that.
4132155	4133576	I believe Reggie said all that.
4133856	4140421	The only surprise of this whole thing, Nintendo Land is marked Holiday.
4140581	4145245	That's the only thing that surprised me because I think Nintendo Land, I thought, was going to be like a pack-in game.
4145845	4146706	You want to hear something funny?
4146746	4147146	All right, what?
4148639	4157488	That list was released on June 6th during E3 by Nintendo.
4158008	4159770	So these things have changed.
4159890	4163393	No, that list is exactly what they released.
4164174	4165195	There is no news here.
4165395	4168518	These are all the announced titles.
4171274	4175256	but yet everybody's GameStop just leaked the entire Wii U lineup.
4175296	4180918	No, they didn't because Nintendo already leaked their fucking lineup a long time ago.
4180999	4187942	I can link everybody to the wonderful, you know, because I knew I recognized that list and yep, it's exact.
4189122	4191403	August 2nd, all over the interwebs.
4191963	4192524	Check that out.
4193164	4193324	Yep.
4194942	4204419	Only, only I shouldn't say only in this industry because this shit happens all the time but only in this industry can two month old news be made news all over again.
4205518	4205798	Right?
4207920	4217208	Well, let me go back and tell you about things that aren't on the list because, you know, that's always fun since, you know, we, we, you know.
4217708	4219450	Let's get you while you're in a mood tonight.
4219570	4222973	I'm just saying, you know, we talked about this a few weeks and here's the other thing too.
4224854	4229118	Like, there's some publishers that aren't on here like Disney Interactive because there's certain titles they...
4229338	4235824	haven't announced yet that our Wii U titles that are coming, but they haven't officially announced it yet.
4236624	4238266	Was that because they're 2013 at this point?
4238486	4238586	No.
4241388	4243951	That's how we know when we, that's how I think I know.
4243971	4245912	Yeah, Wreck-It Ralph's going to be Wii U, isn't it?
4245972	4246113	Nope.
4246453	4246533	No.
4247782	4267037	EpicMinky2 is oh yeah I remember that and then of course you know also this list is not accurate too because they you know they just talked about Madden 13 and also FIFA 13 are going to be launch titles that are going to be on the Wii U so like this is all this right here I can tell you right now just looking at it
4268238	4274222	If I were to guess, I would say that this is a merchandising manual from Nintendo.
4276504	4280347	Some people that may be privy to kind of stuff like that.
4281408	4290374	But that would be my guess where this leak came from because I think that they deliver this stuff to these stores that kind of informs them of the lineup and what kind of stuff that they can look forward to.
4290954	4319793	and they also give them bullet points to talk to with their customers about that stuff it's basically to inform the people that work there about the titles that are coming out and stuff all things Nintendo because if you look at this they have Nintendo DSi product information Nintendo DS product information Nintendo 3DS product information connectivity and policies warnings and disclaimers so it's from Nintendo but it's just the stuff that was all the announced titles from E3
4320592	4325215	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the internet has really low memory spans.
4325296	4326076	Ain't that the truth?
4327257	4334702	But hey, it's cool that certain websites can run with it because GameStop posted it.
4334722	4335503	It must be legit.
4336123	4337564	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
4337605	4338125	DarkSakura.
4339915	4341497	Hey, I have some news.
4341697	4342117	Guess what?
4342838	4346602	It's about stuff we already know about, but I'm going to talk about it because it's fucking hilarious.
4347923	4351126	EA is suing Zynga.
4353048	4358293	They filed a lawsuit against Zynga saying that The Ville is a blatant ripoff of The Sims Social.
4359394	4370602	and it was filed on August 3rd, 2012 saying that they willfully and intentionally quote, copied and misappropriated the original and distinctive expressive elements of the SimSocial in the violation of U.S.
4370622	4371262	copyright laws.
4372443	4376766	And basically it's like, you know, I'm going to paraphrase as I understand it.
4377946	4383510	Zynga's gotten away with a lot of shit against a bunch of people who really can't pay to go against them.
4384050	4384671	We've got money.
4385111	4385671	Let's do it.
4386352	4386672	Bitches.
4391109	4392311	This is the plaintiff.
4394233	4402784	EA claims that the defendant willfully and rootfully copied all of the assets from their popular game, The Sims Social.
4404554	4405294	I'm gonna add this.
4405654	4406755	They're suing for $4,000.
4406815	4412717	This is a quote that's by the EA Maxis label manager, Lucy Bradshaw.
4413417	4414557	This is a case of principle.
4414617	4423120	Maxis isn't the first studio to claim that Zynga copied its creative product, but we are the studio that has the financial and corporate resources to stand up and do something about it.
4423520	4427062	Infringing on a developer's copyright is not an acceptable practice in game development.
4427422	4430683	By calling Zynga out on this illegal practice, in other words, calling them on their shit,
4432044	4438108	We hope to have a secondary effect of protecting the rights of other creative studios who don't have the resources to protect themselves.
4439813	4440273	You know what?
4440593	4441654	I think it's fucking hilarious.
4441674	4448656	And I think that even if there is an offer of a settlement, I don't think that EA should take it.
4448876	4450917	I think they should nail their asses to the fucking wall.
4450977	4453977	This is so fucking weird what's happening with this.
4454017	4454678	Like, for real.
4454718	4455198	Think about it.
4455698	4457178	Suddenly we're all Team EA.
4458479	4463681	Which, weren't they just named the most evil company in America thanks to the internet not that long ago?
4463721	4464501	Yet suddenly here we are.
4464521	4465301	We're all Team EA.
4465321	4467062	They're just trying to redeem themselves, okay?
4467182	4467562	And like...
4468622	4470783	EA, hold on, hold on, this is where it gets better.
4471843	4474784	EA is championing for the little guy.
4476824	4481566	They're sticking up for Nimblebit and all these other, the Bingo Blitz creators and all this.
4482026	4483046	What the fuck?
4483706	4484627	Here's my thing on it.
4485887	4490348	First of all, I mean, at least they're not Chick-fil-A.
4490368	4490448	Okay.
4494850	4498432	So, they're not serving up Mass Effect with a side of hate.
4502415	4507819	You know, I was hoping we could go all night without that coming up, but if it had to come up, alright.
4508859	4510540	Anyway, back to the original point.
4512302	4515984	They've done things that we disagree with, but overall, they've put out quality products, right?
4517625	4523269	You know, you're nodding, so if everyone can hear the rattling in Rob's head, then you'll know he's nodding.
4525665	4527447	Rob, you're kind of bobblehead-y tonight.
4528448	4536015	So anyway, you can... I'm not saying that we're completely team EA.
4536736	4539559	And I honestly do look at part of this as a PR stunt.
4540259	4542502	You know, here's our perfect opportunity.
4542962	4544444	Zynga's been taking all this money.
4544504	4548508	Here's our opportunity to put them down and get some good PR out of the deal.
4549168	4576911	and you know what if I was running a company I'd do the same shit I'd be like hey opportunity let's knock on the door but this is something that honestly a lot of good will come from as long as they stay pretty you know steady in their pursuit and nails didn't get to the wall I think they have to keep going until it's completely just until they're torn apart and then maybe nimble bit will get some money
4579775	4580035	The end.
4580615	4581055	The end.
4582396	4582576	Sorry.
4582596	4583216	You know what I mean?
4583716	4587117	I wanted to go back real quick to talk about that last story we were talking about.
4587177	4589458	I completely forgot about Activision.
4589798	4591979	That was another thing that's on this list.
4592019	4593179	None of the Activision titles are.
4593499	4601082	Like Skylanders Giants, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Transformers Prime, there's a Cabela's Expedition.
4601202	4601622	Oh, right.
4601662	4602262	We get it.
4602322	4603403	It was full of crap.
4603443	4604643	That story on the internet.
4605383	4606444	Just wanted to add that.
4607064	4607784	My Nintendo news.
4608084	4613590	Anyway, going back to the current story, if you look at the comparisons, it really is side-by-side.
4613630	4618155	They took a lot of the material from SimSocial.
4618195	4622740	Well, the hilarious part was the one that flip-flopped where the lawyer got the damn screen wrong.
4623420	4648679	but I mean when they're I mean there's some pretty damning evidence in there I mean I know this is all allegedly and we're not supposed to talk about it like it's already a done deal but let's be real we're all gamers we've saw through this shit a long time ago yeah and I gotta hand it to the lawyers they're breaking it down the fucking number of pixels in the doorway is the same between the two games when you look at that you're like I the smacketh down has been broughten
4648979	4657343	If you rearrange the furniture in this room to look like the other room, you overlap the fridge, and they're the same fridge!
4660945	4662966	I'm sitting there with my big tub of popcorn.
4663026	4664967	I want this to play out in the people's court.
4665067	4666627	I want this to be televised.
4666667	4668308	We will Wapner on them.
4668748	4671650	Get Wapner out of retirement to preside over this.
4671750	4674491	You know that this shit is pretty much...
4676312	4680134	We want you to take this game and change it enough so we don't get sued.
4682636	4683056	In the groove.
4683776	4691120	Look, Zynga is really going to need a moment of how are we going to survive as a company?
4691440	4695143	Because they're being kicked in the balls left and right right now.
4695363	4697304	People are selling their stock.
4698103	4706228	But I mean, we've all talked about we know good people that work for Zynga and I don't want people to think just because we think Zynga is evil means all the people that work there are evil.
4706248	4706869	That's not the case.
4706929	4708650	People just do whatever job they have to do to get by.
4708830	4714814	But clearly management needs to go another direction and some higher ups need to get sacked.
4715174	4724140	And it's not to say that they can't pull themselves out of this because let's look at another company that was kind of and it's still kind of famous of ripping off other companies.
4724720	4725501	Gameloft.
4725981	4727462	Gameloft does a lot of like
4727702	4732325	Hey, that looks awfully close to Halo, or hey, that looks just like Call of Duty.
4732545	4733205	But you know what?
4733625	4734165	They're not.
4734666	4741549	They aren't literally... I mean, it's ripping off of a genre, I guess, or like a type of game, but they're actually good games.
4741950	4747673	That's the weird thing, although they aren't... One might argue that Dungeon Master Online is actually better than Diablo 3.
4750837	4753358	At least one of those games can be played offline.
4753778	4761900	If they can focus on making good games, because they are capable of making games, it's just come up with your own fucking ideas for once.
4762060	4763741	There's a lot of independent guys out there.
4764181	4769242	You bought some of them because maybe you couldn't figure out how to copy their game without it going.
4769622	4770123	Thanks for watching!
4782714	4783515	All right, let's move on.
4783535	4785738	We're running long tonight, so let's pick up the pace a little bit.
4786239	4786559	Loki.
4787120	4787380	All right.
4788121	4791486	So let's talk a little bit about the UK.
4791786	4793969	They've adopted the Peggy rating system.
4794110	4794690	Hooray.
4794710	4795151	Good for them.
4795472	4796393	Hooray for uniformity.
4796413	4798275	They were already duplicating it, weren't they?
4798556	4799357	Doing double ratings?
4799557	4800418	They were doing something.
4818997	4835280	and then also now UK retailer workers can face prosecution for selling games with a PEGI rating of higher than the customer, obviously 12, 16 or 18 to underage customers with a maximum sentence of six years.
4835460	4838900	Wow, that's pretty ridiculous.
4839881	4843661	Six years for selling a game to a minor?
4844922	4847502	Especially like a teen game, that just seems a little harsh.
4848419	4856602	Well, I think it's more just trying to... Well, see, you know what my problem is with the rating systems is that it's discouraging parents from doing their damn job.
4857722	4858242	End of story.
4859563	4865585	You know, I think that the ratings should be there to inform the parent, and then the parent should do their damn job.
4865985	4866165	Yeah.
4866685	4866805	So...
4868720	4872663	This is kind of like that California law come to life, right?
4872723	4876365	Isn't this the whole thing that the Supreme Court overturned not that long ago is now happening?
4876705	4880148	Am I reading this right, or am I misunderstanding something?
4880168	4897639	Well, yes and no, but see, their thing was, it wasn't tied to, I don't know if it was tied to the M-rated stuff, but I don't know if that law, I don't know the UK laws too well, if they do something similar to the movies, the movies that are rated by the BBFC.
4899460	4903603	If it's mature or something and you sell it to a minor, if they get the same type of infraction.
4904563	4913388	Because if they're going to put that in place on games, I think it should be uniform across all platforms of media if you're going to do something that drastic.
4913468	4926256	I think it's still kind of drastic, but if that's the route they're going to go, as long as it's equal across all the different media platforms, then okay, I guess.
4928993	4933896	It'll be interesting to see how this pans out and what possible future legal challenges await, yes?
4933916	4938498	Because that's what always inevitably ends up happening is legal challenges.
4938638	4939098	Fun, fun.
4940359	4949904	I don't know anybody who will sue over this unless they somehow get roped into playing this without agreeing to be a willing participant in this.
4950904	4954187	And this is a case of some kids with a lot of free time on their hands.
4954267	4955087	Not that that's bad.
4955167	4957289	It's just the interesting things that are created.
4957949	4960431	It's a Sega Genesis modification.
4960951	4962472	It's called Genesap.
4963112	4963893	It has a motto.
4964233	4965594	I believe it would be Genesap.
4965634	4966114	Genesap?
4966175	4967435	It's G-E-N-E.
4967575	4967876	Gene.
4968236	4969617	Genesap would be Gene.
4969817	4970377	Genesap?
4970858	4971478	Like Genesis?
4971678	4972959	Well, look.
4973019	4973840	Okay, Genesap.
4974060	4974740	All right, I'll go with that.
4974780	4975301	Genesap.
4975421	4976702	No pity for bad players.
4977182	4977662	What is it?
4977822	4979744	It's a dog shock collar.
4980624	4989368	That will zap you, whoever's wearing it, when they screw up or take damage in certain Genesis games that have been modded.
4990209	4993210	Oh, I guess they do say it's Genesis, so it's Genazap.
4993710	4995071	Not GeneZap, my bad.
4995531	4997132	Looked like GeneCo.
4997352	4999273	Their genes may be zapped by...
5000296	5001056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5017501	5027084	Where, let's see, it says go to 4 minutes 10 seconds in where Sonic falls into a spike pit and there will be a stream of bleeped out French cursing.
5027244	5028204	Oh, that sounds good to me.
5028304	5030245	Let's fast forward to that part in the video.
5030265	5034186	Let's go to 4 minutes.
5035126	5037446	It's in French, but you can hear Sonic in the background.
5037486	5037867	Here we go.
5052817	5056183	I'm glad to see that the kids in other countries are just as dumb as the ones here.
5059193	5062235	That's really what it boils down to, isn't it?
5092810	5095832	Clover Nikon says, sounds like an add-on for Jackass the Game.
5095852	5111041	You know, it's really weird that I kept getting shocked when I was playing Bomberman Act Zero, but for some reason... It felt like I was getting kicked in the balls repeatedly, but it was just when I thought about the $60 I spent on Bomberman Act Zero.
5112923	5115444	Alright, one more story from DarkSakura and then the release dates.
5115564	5116105	DarkSakura.
5116841	5119943	Well, how about some good news for E3?
5120443	5122465	They've confirmed they're staying in Los Angeles until 2015.
5122585	5125407	Basically, they're like, bitches, this is our town.
5125907	5126988	You're not building shit.
5127008	5133632	Yeah, because the city was going to tear down, what was it, the South Hall?
5134933	5135914	I think West.
5136054	5136474	West Hall.
5137014	5139436	And build like a coliseum or some shit.
5140036	5143799	But instead they're like... They're going to build a stadium for a football team they don't have yet.
5143979	5145080	Yeah, like I said.
5145100	5146841	Weren't they building it on the roof or something?
5146862	5148283	Like I said, some shit.
5151065	5159752	But yeah, basically they're saying that they've generated $40 million for Los Angeles in three days when they do the show.
5160013	5165617	So they're basically bringing in enough revenue that the city can't really afford to fuck with them.
5166318	5168580	So it's going to be there for another three years.
5170034	5171555	Three more years.
5171775	5172376	Yay.
5173036	5174137	Three more years.
5174177	5177760	By the way, I have a comment.
5177840	5178320	Three more years.
5178881	5179882	I ran to the kitchen, but I have a comment.
5180642	5181283	And I'm stealing a chip.
5181383	5190089	I seem to remember something else about this story about how they've also worked out that the nearby vendors will no longer jack up their prices during the week of E3.
5190170	5191290	And here's my big question.
5191551	5192752	Does that include parking?
5192852	5193332	It should.
5193352	5197055	How many blocks away did we have to park the last time?
5198117	5198998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5228404	5235411	Because the year that E4ALL happened and, you know, LA lost that money, it was a little kick in the butt.
5236212	5236672	It really was.
5236692	5237153	Yeah, they learned.
5237713	5244320	And one could argue they may be building that new stadium to bid for, I've heard rumors LA is supposed to be bidding for another Olympic Games.
5245921	5246602	That's a mistake.
5247042	5250546	That ends up putting such an economic cripple on the town that hosts it.
5252515	5253175	It depends.
5253255	5256997	If you look historically, when LA did it, it actually didn't.
5257597	5264640	I don't know how, I'm sure Bobby could answer how it worked for Atlanta, but I think when LA did it, it was fine.
5264820	5266400	Seoul was plunged into debt.
5267361	5268561	Beijing was plunged into debt.
5270062	5274983	Almost anywhere that's hosted it has been plunged into debt afterwards with just the fallout from what's going on afterwards.
5275324	5276104	But it's the Olympics.
5277256	5280918	And not to mention that they have to kick out residents to build whatever facilities are there.
5280978	5283619	The one in Greece still wasn't finished while the games were going on.
5284540	5284980	What you saying?
5285981	5286761	Bobby clarifies.
5287081	5288562	Atlanta didn't lose money at all in the games.
5290703	5292504	Alright, but it was commercialized all to hell.
5292744	5292904	Yeah.
5293645	5298928	When I went to Vancouver in 2006, the Olympic Games were being shoved down my throat.
5299898	5300698	Not that it's a bad thing.
5300798	5301438	Olympics are fun.
5301638	5303519	I prefer the Winter Olympics, personally.
5304439	5307920	But anyway, let's not talk about things that are going to be happening in the year 2020.
5308720	5313802	Let's talk about next week and video games that are coming out to your nearby stores.
5313902	5314862	We'll start with the U.S., Loki.
5315082	5320804	Well, I hope you like games that feature Persona characters fighting each other because that's all that's coming out this week.
5320884	5324125	Persona 4 Arena on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
5324265	5325645	Remember, it's not region-free.
5327926	5328546	Not region-free.
5329588	5330709	Sniper Elite V2 Sniper Elite V2 Sniper Elite V2
5355826	5357546	Wow, there's nothing on the 3DS.
5357827	5358867	That kind of surprises me.
5359487	5362248	There ain't anything listed until the 23rd on the 3DS.
5362308	5363128	What a slow period.
5363148	5364228	What holiday is going on?
5365468	5365889	I don't know.
5366249	5368249	Let me look at the Vita real quick, see if there's anything big there.
5368709	5369589	There's a couple games there.
5369729	5375851	There's Ginsei Shogi, Kayutendo Tofu Rajin comes out this week, as well as...
5376491	5378052	Orga Rhythm comes out.
5378112	5381334	I wonder if that's the same thing as the Sound Shapes game that's coming out here on the Vita.
5381374	5382415	Isn't that this week, by the way?
5382555	5383135	You might have missed that.
5383155	5385597	I think Sound Shapes is out this week on the Vita.
5385757	5386818	That's a digital only release.
5387298	5388318	Ooh, that could be.
5388859	5389119	It is.
5389499	5391460	No, this title actually looks a little different.
5391881	5394542	It's actually not a rhythm game, even though it's in the... Or maybe it is.
5395443	5395663	It is.
5396243	5397024	Sound Shapes is.
5397104	5398305	It looks like Pikmin to me.
5398725	5403268	No, this game, this Orga Rhythm looks like a... It's an action game, they're calling it.
5403948	5405573	Yeah, hit a button when the queue falls.
5405693	5406355	Hmm, interesting.
5406916	5409824	Yeah, it is kind of a music game, but it looks like music infused with Pikmin.
5410165	5410867	Kind of looks interesting.
5412455	5412916	That's it.
5413816	5416899	Oh, AkumaJP in the chat room, next week is Obon Holiday.
5416919	5418120	I hope I said that right.
5418580	5418861	Which one?
5419021	5419321	Obon.
5419681	5419982	Oh, yeah.
5420622	5423545	I thought there was a holiday coming up around this time of year.
5423625	5424045	Gotcha.
5424065	5425386	I mean, it could just be for the holiday.
5426027	5426287	Could be.
5426948	5429410	So, in the UK, there's a few releases.
5429570	5431392	On the 7th is Unmechanical.
5432312	5434434	On the 8th is Hero Academy and Hybrid.
5435375	5436356	And that's it.
5437182	5437862	But a few things.
5438042	5438302	A few.
5438503	5438743	A few.
5439003	5439483	Just a few.
5439963	5440243	A bit.
5440303	5440663	A bit.
5441284	5444405	A few more stories and then the classic game of the week is coming at you.
5444445	5445285	But first, Loki.
5446425	5446726	Alright.
5448006	5449847	So, Minecraft.
5450247	5451447	There's some interesting things with that.
5451507	5455369	First, starting off, 1.31's update has come out.
5456269	5466393	And what you can get with that, of course, now they've merged single players and multiplayer so they have a unified mode.
5466913	5495096	and then also they've added a few things including a chest for or the ender chest as well as writable books and you can trade now they've added tripwires which sounds awesome large biomes world type also some cocoa beans to the jungles emeralds and emerald blocks and emerald ore and
5497031	5502276	I guess a bonus chest option, which allows people to have some stuff starting off.
5503177	5507061	So you spawn with a chest with a few basic tools nearby, which is kind of cool.
5507982	5511205	Also, let's see...
5513103	5541410	just some other bug fixes like mobs being able to clip through walls stuff like that so that's kind of cool and then to go along with that Minecon 2012 has been announced and it's going to be going to Disneyland Paris in November I want to go to Minecon Disneyland Paris November 24th and 25th I found something for you in Japantown by the way
5544471	5545332	A Minecraft mask.
5547216	5548759	A big foam mask of the dude.
5549800	5550281	Steve.
5550963	5551343	I guess.
5551444	5552245	Or Creeper.
5552265	5555251	They had Creeper masks too and the pickaxe.
5555571	5555832	Awesome.
5556954	5557294	All right.
5557695	5562318	Well, I doubt you found any memorabilia for this game because it's several years old, but it's coming back.
5562819	5563479	Do you remember?
5564040	5564941	Imagine 1994.
5566422	5567863	And remember Wolfenstein 3D?
5568704	5573307	Well, there was a game that came out not long after Wolfenstein 3D called Rise of the Triad.
5574188	5576530	Rise of the Triad is coming back, y'all.
5576590	5578431	It's coming on Unreal Engine 3.
5579412	5582414	Apogee Software announced this at QuakeCon over the weekend.
5583155	5589559	This was in rumor status earlier in the week, but literally earlier today it was confirmed and a trailer is out right now.
5590019	5597385	The developer is Interceptor Software and the original Rise of the Triad level designer, Joe Siegler, is one of the members.
5597925	5598485	Pretty awesome.
5598525	5602108	Single player, of course, online multiplayer and a level editor.
5602528	5603429	It looks pretty awesome.
5603820	5606081	Via Steamworks you'll be able to share stuff.
5606622	5607722	Yeah, sounds pretty cool.
5608183	5612465	So all of the crazy weapons and dog mode.
5614587	5616648	So this is definitely for the fans.
5616668	5620390	The gameplay and it looked pretty awesome because I wasn't really a fan of Rise of the Triad.
5620430	5622231	I mean, I played it a few times, the shareware game.
5622712	5626834	But it looks pretty cool because it's kind of like a hybrid between like...
5628255	5635757	Like a Wolfenstein or Duke Nukem, but fast like the Unreal games, Unreal Tournament stuff.
5635837	5641658	So it looked kind of cool, like a lot of the fast gameplay and just with that kind of setting.
5642238	5642758	I could dig that.
5643258	5645039	A lot of folks in our chat room are getting excited.
5645079	5646319	DDR Dollar Bill, yes!
5646439	5649880	I am a bit disappointed that there's not a console version.
5650840	5651760	It's only PC right now.
5653015	5655818	Eh, if they're doing all the Steamworks and all that, I can see it.
5655918	5660203	I mean, I realized PlayStation was supposed to do the Steam integration, but only one game has done it.
5660763	5661424	So, hmm.
5663593	5663953	All right.
5664373	5667175	Well, let's go back to a time maybe perhaps even before 1994.
5668155	5670816	Actually, I have no idea when this week's game came out.
5671497	5674978	But DarkSakura will clarify that for us right now.
5675659	5676599	It's a little older than that.
5676859	5677460	A little older than that.
5677480	5677800	A little newer.
5677820	5678380	Sorry, a little newer.
5678400	5678840	A little newer.
5678880	5679120	All right.
5679160	5688265	Every week, DarkSakura likes to jump into the classic gaming vault and find a classic video game that she thinks, hey, you little brats, play this game or suffer my wrath.
5689085	5692546	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5692966	5697107	Donpachi, which is awesome and very hard.
5698407	5703248	Donpachi is one of the... Actually, play the screen.
5704608	5706889	Play the opening screen, because I can never say it quite right.
5706909	5707789	I love the way the guy says it.
5707849	5708309	Oh, my bad.
5708349	5708629	Hold on.
5709429	5710450	And then after that, you can fast forward.
5710730	5710950	Okay.
5713370	5714671	Presented by Kate.
5715651	5716211	If that helps.
5716231	5716871	Little voiceovers.
5727441	5729343	Just because I can never say it like that.
5729483	5730664	Don't punch!
5731224	5735387	Anyway, it's made by Cave and published by Atlas in 1995.
5736028	5741733	Yes, for anyone who knows the term Cave Shooter, this pretty much started it.
5741913	5747717	It was the first game that was developed by Cave and the second on their first generation arcade hardware.
5747737	5748978	The first was Power Instinct 2.
5750079	5756485	The title means Leader B. But it's also an onomatopoeia as in the sound of firing guns.
5757386	5762215	So it is, like I said, one of the first bullet hell games.
5763769	5775792	So basically, you play as a pilot whose mission is to just survive an eight years long training mission so that you can become one of the Dompachi Squadron.
5777212	5782674	So basically, you're progressing through their training period.
5782754	5783954	So you have two modes of fire.
5783994	5791056	You have a shot fire one, but holding it down, you have a concentrated vertical beam, but it slows down your ship like a whole freaking lot.
5792117	5793999	You have three different kinds of aircraft.
5794539	5798423	You have Type A, which is the red one that has a narrow stream of shots.
5798944	5800025	Type B, which is green.
5800786	5808254	It's a helicopter that has main guns forward and then side guns that rotate 90 degrees from forward when you're moving horizontally.
5808294	5814300	And then Type C, which is the blue or black one that has a wide three-way spread shot, which honestly, Type C is my favorite.
5814560	5815781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5836475	5841539	So you've got five different areas, and you can loop them if you complete them.
5841619	5849586	The second loop has the same areas, the same patterns, but it's a denser bullet, so basically it really does turn into the bullet hell.
5850627	5859934	And if you get the final boss in the second loop, you have a secret area where you meet the big boss of the game, the Hachi, which is a bee.
5862316	5865478	So basically, other than that though, it's pretty much a shooter.
5865498	5875065	You can get your power increases, you can get your bomb increases, and MP, you can pick it up after you've continued so it returns all of your powers to full strength.
5877028	5878349	www.DarkSakura.com
5901847	5902848	You know, your leftovers.
5903348	5904429	So that's pretty much it.
5904509	5911794	I mean, this was the game that started the whole bullet hell series of games.
5911934	5917518	And it did have a sequel, Dodonpach, which is out on iPhone.
5917958	5918779	You can play it on the iPhone.
5920925	5922866	But it probably sucks, let's be real.
5922886	5923506	Well, I don't know.
5923686	5930949	Espagabaluda, which I can never say right, did perform very well.
5931249	5934731	I actually planned on buying the Domepachi Revolution, wasn't it called?
5934811	5936951	Or Resurrection or whatever the crap.
5937852	5941693	The game Domepachi is out on Saturn and it is a game that's on my list to buy.
5943274	5944254	Awesome freaking game.
5944795	5946495	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5946715	5947176	Domepachi!
5947636	5948056	Domepachi!
5950365	5954486	Bullet Hell, Vertical Love See, you're not even getting into the Bullet Hell part of it.
5954506	5955467	This is still like the first fucking level.
5955487	5956147	Yeah, this looks easy.
5956827	5959968	Yeah, I can make it through the first two levels of Donpachi, no problem.
5959988	5962189	Let me forward later in the video here, see what happens.
5962269	5964230	Yeah, there you're getting a little bit more into the Bullet Hell.
5964250	5964630	There you go.
5964670	5967751	But the second playthrough, uh-uh, no, I can't do it.
5968831	5972052	And I ended up getting kind of dizzy playing Bullet Hell games.
5972092	5973733	See, that's where you get into it.
5974033	5979656	I am not good at bullet hell games I'm just going to go ahead and say this But I love them She doesn't dodge bullets, she shoots them
6001761	6006327	Well, that's kind of why I like Ikaruga, because you can absorb the ones.
6006387	6008490	It makes it a little bit easier to get through the mass.
6009150	6012675	But I freaking played the crap out of Espaluda on my phone.
6012995	6013696	So, just saying.
6014157	6015599	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6016448	6017709	We're going to take a break, kids.
6018109	6019430	Don't go anywhere when we come back.
6019550	6032559	Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, your calls, your emails, and some more news, including a Steam decision that may prove to be not too popular, but seems to be popular with a lot of game makers and game publishers right now.
6033040	6036722	We'll be back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6036783	6037243	Don't go anywhere.
6043280	6052722	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode 468 in progress, August the 5th of 2012, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
6053162	6055063	All right, Loki, what was this you were bringing up during the break?
6055523	6057343	You were going to tell it on air anyway, so go ahead.
6058204	6062925	I was going to send Ernest Cline a message on Twitter because...
6064225	6074789	Basically, the world record for Black Tiger is only possible on this machine at... What do they call it?
6074989	6076770	It's Fun Spot.
6078311	6080492	It's the one that the world record was accomplished on.
6080552	6083173	That's the huge classic game arcade.
6083193	6084693	That's the one that's in the movies and all that shit.
6084713	6085674	It's a huge arcade.
6086934	6089695	Their people have already beat it on the actual machine.
6089835	6092316	It's just that they haven't been verified by Twin Galaxies.
6093957	6094538	DarkSakura.com
6118119	6122023	And though for sure it's all in English, I just figured I'd push it higher at this fun spot.
6122304	6126288	This morning, I think I scored 2.7 million.
6126308	6127128	That was my highest.
6128710	6132834	So basically, it's impossible to hit that score unless you go to fun spot.
6133335	6135837	So fuck that shit, is what I gotta say.
6136858	6157682	and just because Twin Galaxies doesn't want to cop up to the fact that oh hey, we didn't really investigate this board and just because the guy that refed that shit fucking doesn't know anything about Black Tiger and maybe isn't aware of the fact that you can grind your score up by running through the game really fast and at the end you're basically taking out zombies that keep respawning and that's how you get your score up.
6157742	6165464	That is well known in the community that plays Black Tiger even for me who doesn't know anything about Black Tiger but oh, just all of a sudden got into the community about it.
6166244	6169126	So that needs to be pointed out so that they can fix this shit.
6169667	6174310	Because I would like to legitimately have a high score in that game, but I can't if the game is fucking modded.
6178393	6179554	This is the plaintiff.
6181996	6184958	He goes by Loki on a podcast that nobody listens to.
6185359	6190522	He claims that the defendants, a bunch of fucking fucktards who don't know how to run a contest...
6191601	6192443	We're negligent.
6193686	6195691	He's suing for a 12-pack of Diet Pepsi.
6198743	6199363	It's legit.
6199404	6204647	The guy that beat the score is familiar with Black Tiger, and that's how he said it scored.
6204987	6208450	So I don't understand why Twin Galaxies can go and claim.
6209090	6210191	Go investigate it then.
6210271	6216375	Go have someone play that game because obviously someone's very easily able to beat that high score.
6216615	6220658	Have them play the game and watch how it scores or have them verify.
6220678	6221679	I am so over this.
6222700	6227966	I'm just like, we don't check the machine, but they did it to Steve Wiebe's machine on film.
6228046	6232151	I understand that you guys are over this, but you're not over the fucking Chick-fil-A shit.
6232311	6232832	I'm sorry.
6233052	6235335	You mean Chick-fil-A show?
6235595	6236736	Please, please don't.
6238879	6241081	Yes, I am over it, so let's not go there.
6242103	6242363	Alright.
6246998	6250782	Uh, I need to filet this episode over to Lounge Radio.
6251142	6255267	I did see the best ever take on that for marketing purpose.
6255667	6256949	The chick on chick filet.
6258230	6259392	It was a double chicken breast.
6259592	6260112	Alright, look.
6260493	6262115	We're gonna get into rapid fire news.
6262515	6263876	Hey Bradley, how you doing?
6263916	6267078	Our special guest here in the studio on this historic night.
6267118	6267918	How you hanging in there?
6268078	6268478	I'm alright.
6268558	6270560	I apologize for Loki's behavior tonight.
6271240	6276823	And the constant barrage of references on things we come to Sunday nights at Orange Launch Radio to escape from.
6277123	6278984	What are you playing on your 3DS over there?
6279204	6280445	Playing Mole Mania right now.
6280945	6281146	What?
6281506	6282046	Mole Mania?
6282106	6282626	Mole Mania.
6282766	6284387	Oh, I thought you said Mall Mania at first.
6284407	6285668	I'm like, what the hell game is that?
6285708	6286529	Why are you playing it?
6289731	6290031	All right.
6291272	6291772	How is it?
6292613	6292994	How's the game?
6293014	6295256	Is that an old school Game Boy game or like a new 3DS game?
6295396	6296717	It's an old school Game Boy game.
6297017	6298318	It's on a virtual console.
6300120	6302122	What other virtual console games you own on that thing over there?
6303103	6307247	I think the only thing I have is Dragon Crystal, which is a Game Gear game.
6307907	6308188	Nice.
6308908	6311871	And of course the other like Ambassador games, stuff like that, but.
6312273	6313154	As quickly as possible!
6313214	6313334	Loki!
6341363	6342144	I'll wait for the mic there.
6343544	6347587	So anyways, let's talk a little bit about NBA 2K13.
6347967	6356813	And apparently now, I don't even know why this is a thing, but apparently Jay-Z is going to be executive producing the game.
6357293	6361336	I don't know if that changes your opinion on whether you should buy that game or not, but...
6363052	6369942	Yeah, so he's going to have, I guess he's doing some of the, picking up the soundtrack maybe?
6371284	6379015	He's got a bunch of his songs in there, and looks like a lot of other hip-hop artists in there as well.
6379420	6382022	You know, actually, I think it's kind of a clever move.
6382102	6397512	Like, I know some of y'all might be skeptical about it, but it's star power, and it's a big star with a lot of power, and I think for those two worlds to kind of collide, the music world and the gaming world, I think there's definitely a lot of people that are going to
6398172	6403035	They're going to turn their head a little closer at NBA 2K13 because of Jay-Z's involvement.
6403336	6406218	I mean, it's stories like this.
6407058	6408419	Would we talk about this otherwise?
6408499	6409059	Probably not.
6409680	6413602	It's that whole thing that's probably good for him being on board.
6413622	6416044	Props to them for including Daft Punk around the world.
6416084	6416725	That's kind of cool.
6417365	6419426	And there's a Justice song in there.
6421188	6424350	I'm pretty sure Jay-Z's married to Beyonce, for heaven's sake.
6424390	6427612	I mean, I'm pretty sure he's pretty diverse with his music likes.
6429013	6433417	I guess they were a little disappointed about all the characters being leaked out.
6451702	6455947	Chan Park of Superbot Entertainment said that was unexpected and unintended.
6457448	6458009	No shit.
6461152	6464855	So yeah, apparently they're going to make some more official character announcements.
6464875	6470922	They'll probably include it in those ones that they've already leaked out August 15th during Gamescom.
6471923	6472763	And last but not least...
6473524	6474264	Thank you for watching!
6504803	6508086	The religion, I guess, is called Kiflam.
6510508	6510768	Neat.
6511509	6513170	Yeah, EpsilonProgram.com.
6513711	6517394	You can go check it out, and they've got some stuff there.
6520629	6521470	Are you getting excited?
6521490	6522191	Are you getting hyped?
6522351	6523752	All this Grand Theft Auto V stuff?
6523812	6525815	Well, there's not really much Grand Theft Auto V stuff right now.
6525835	6539870	In fact, they had the whole financial conference thing that they were talking about all the different games and how they were doing and everything, and Grand Theft Auto V wasn't even really mentioned too much, so...
6540571	6543095	It's kind of neat that they're going to have some stuff.
6543355	6545439	I'm hoping that we get some out of Gamescom.
6545459	6551490	I'd like to see something, but I'm guessing that this game is probably not coming until at least April of next year.
6553811	6560517	Stan in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, if anyone gets a beta code for All-Stars Battle Royale and you don't want it, I'd be happy to take it off your hands.
6562018	6565761	Ratchet Tag speculating on the JZ NBA 2K13.
6565821	6567002	Blue Ivy will be in it.
6567803	6568684	No way, Jose.
6569124	6572186	That baby's going to be like Michael Jackson's kids back when they were young.
6574068	6577971	They had to go out and wear the face coverings so that the media couldn't get pictures.
6578792	6579512	That's what will happen.
6580842	6584144	Alright, moving on to some other rapid fire news.
6584284	6587606	Doom 3 is getting a re-release as we've already talked about before.
6587686	6589206	Doom 3 BFG edition.
6589587	6590947	Some news coming out of QuakeCon.
6591228	6595430	There is going to be an extra Lost mission that will be in the HD remaster.
6595550	6599272	Don't know what the Lost mission entails, but not too surprising.
6599412	6603294	Usually these types of remasters and remakes get some type of extra bonus thing.
6603594	6606836	So something that was originally on the cutting room floor makes a lot of sense.
6607416	6612443	So it comes out this October if you missed Doom 3 the first time around or you'll want to play it again.
6613932	6619896	One game I can't understand why people play again and again, but it's like torture.
6620377	6624119	This is the type of game that I would have expected Loki would have to beat to win a DeLorean.
6624139	6625200	You ever played QWOP?
6626341	6627181	I've played QWOP.
6627201	6632104	I've been dying to download this because I really want to shoot some pigeons.
6632165	6632965	Well, actually, yeah.
6633385	6634646	It's not QWOP.
6634706	6635547	I call it QWOP.
6635707	6635847	QWOP.
6635867	6636047	QWOP.
6636648	6636928	QWOP.
6638969	6639849	Thanks for watching!
6657837	6660119	Um, what, how, god, how the hell do you describe it?
6660179	6666224	It's like a running simulation, but, like, remember, like, Track and Field by Konami back in the 80s in the arcade?
6666584	6670027	Running was simulated by hitting the buttons as fast as you can, like, right?
6670087	6673030	And on the old school NES games and the power pad, run as fast as you can.
6673410	6675432	Q-Op is actually about, like...
6676152	6683157	Ben the Knee, Ben the Ankle, and it's four buttons to control it, but it's all like super physics and stuff.
6683617	6690162	So now there is Klopp, and it is by the maker of Klopp and Gurp and whatever other games they've come out with.
6690542	6702210	Klopp is a four-legged unicorn that you use H, J, K, and L to control the unicorn, and in this one, good luck getting up hills.
6702951	6703071	Yeah.
6706735	6709016	That's the game Loki should have had to play.
6710798	6713479	I tried playing Klopp and I kept laughing.
6713539	6714020	It was fun.
6714960	6716001	I've never played it.
6716201	6717042	You haven't played Klopp?
6717722	6719263	God, I'm worried where this is going.
6719283	6719904	I've never played it.
6720644	6725107	Klopp, you control each foot of the horse.
6725728	6734314	If you happen to use the front feet, you unlock lame horse mode where the back feet get broken and you have to crawl with the front feet.
6735626	6736926	This sounds ridiculous.
6737046	6741787	And there's like this weird Justin Bieber looking character that keeps making fun of you when you die.
6742367	6744828	Or not even necessarily die, but you like... That's just rude.
6744868	6746708	You slowly tip over backwards.
6746728	6747449	It's kind of funny.
6747549	6748289	That's just rude.
6748329	6749989	Justin Bieber comes out and makes fun of you?
6750049	6752790	Yeah, it looks like Zac Efron or Justin Bieber.
6752890	6754290	I mean, it's just weird.
6755510	6758271	Ratchet Tag in our chatroom says, Unicorns make everything better.
6758931	6759531	Exactly.
6759571	6761091	And that's exactly what this game is all about.
6761111	6761972	Does it fart rainbows?
6762412	6762772	It might.
6763992	6765552	I only want a unicorn that farts rainbows.
6766393	6774615	Well, maybe you can find the rainbow farting special item in the World of Warcraft arcade cabinet that is apparently on its way out in China.
6775355	6781956	There's a China Digital Entertainment Expo going on right now, and apparently there is a World of Warcraft arcade machine on its way.
6783677	6786377	League of Legends, Starcraft 2, and some other stuff as well.
6786417	6789438	And yeah, they show pictures of people playing it in an arcade-style machine.
6789918	6798305	Now don't think, like, I'm not talking like it's a special arcade release of the game, but you gotta remember the arcades in Asia, still very much a thriving community.
6798625	6803669	Things like cyber cafes and things that never took off here do much better in these other countries.
6803709	6806091	So it's really about the kind of the community and getting together.
6806192	6810275	So the fact that they're putting these games in arcade style cabinets, really not a surprise at all.
6810815	6813177	Especially if you look at Counter-Strike Neo.
6813237	6813678	Look at that.
6813998	6815219	That's a very pretty machine.
6815259	6817501	All these little sit-down cabinets, people playing Counter-Strike.
6818301	6818462	So...
6819242	6823004	Interesting, but not something you're going to see over here anytime soon, I'm sure of that.
6823965	6825926	DarkSakura, are we able to get those stories going?
6826046	6826266	Cool.
6826806	6827086	What's up?
6827526	6834730	Well, how about first off, Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed has bonus edition with an Outrun track and Metal Sonic.
6836591	6839052	Ooh, and it has an in-game emoticon sticker pack.
6839192	6840913	But will it have Magical Sound Shower?
6841253	6842514	I don't care because it has the Opa Opa.
6845231	6846712	And then, Rocksmith.
6847472	6853255	It's getting a base mode on August 14th, looks like.
6854055	6861498	So it will have bassists that can improve their skills with two-finger plucking, slapping, and popping.
6861598	6863159	Sounds very dirty.
6863959	6867841	But it also has bass technique challenges, tutorial videos, and minigames.
6868682	6869962	So lots of bass stuff.
6870582	6871763	Because bass is awesome.
6873847	6894921	I am partial to the base and then how about this for QuakeCon Steam's having a sale Bethesda games are cheap it's the QuakeCon bundle that's going to have 20 games and again I'm reading this off of a British site so 300 pounds worth for 70 pounds for the lot of it
6896002	6897483	And today is Elder Scrolls Day.
6899564	6910952	This is, of course, as of Sunday, where you can get the Elder Scrolls collection for 47% off, Morrowind for 66% off, and Oblivion for 66% off.
6911432	6914915	Skyrim will be 50% off, so this is your chance to get it on the cheap.
6916576	6920979	There's also going to be a QuakeCon sale happening in the App Store.
6922720	6923080	So there you go.
6924201	6924421	Nice.
6925182	6926203	All right, let's move on.
6926343	6929726	And every week we do a segment here called the Fugle Question of the Week.
6931388	6934390	Take Facebook, take Google, put it together, you get Fugle.
6936852	6947082	And we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities every week and read some of the answers here on the show and to poll our folks in studios as well as to their thoughts on this question.
6947122	6948483	We'll start with Google Plus tonight.
6948543	6949203	Here's the question.
6950399	6952381	An article on VOG earlier this week.
6952481	6954242	I hope you all are reading the articles at VOG.
6954402	6957505	I know we haven't been publishing a lot, but we've been trying to get some stuff out there.
6957545	6959326	And there was a good one this week from Alan.
6960627	6962048	And I'm not just saying that because he lives here.
6962909	6968053	But he wrote a good article about Minecraft and kind of what made him really like the game the third try.
6968614	6971236	The first time he played Minecraft, he was like, what the hell is this shit?
6971576	6975578	But, you know, the second time a little more, third time finally fell in love with it.
6975978	6986163	So our question to the Fugles this week is, has there ever been a game that you really didn't like the first time you played it, only to come back a second or third or fourth time and fall in love with it?
6986543	6989024	What do you think caused the change in your opinion?
6989945	6994227	So I'm sure some of us here in studio can think of games like this, but what is the game?
6994767	6995728	We'll get around here in a minute.
6996008	6997849	All right, let's start with Panaxiom on Google+.
6998349	7000370	For me, it was the Civilization franchise.
7001070	7006713	I just couldn't get into it, but then I started downloading all the awesome mods for Civ 4, and that changed everything.
7007034	7008474	Fantasy World, yes please.
7008534	7010556	Sci-fi colonization, hell yeah.
7010876	7011556	So, mods.
7012717	7016439	Redertainment says, yes, in fact I'll be playing it when this show airs.
7016519	7017680	Dragon Age Origins.
7018280	7018881	DarkSakura.com
7033917	7035158	You know what?
7035218	7038341	I saw a movie in the theater and it's one of my favorite movies.
7038381	7039262	This was a couple years ago.
7039883	7040403	Stardust.
7040423	7041164	Do you ever see that movie?
7041204	7042265	I love that movie.
7042305	7042945	Love.
7043166	7043906	It's so good.
7043926	7045568	I have it on HD DVD.
7045688	7046449	Yeah, me too.
7046809	7047309	And Blu-ray.
7047570	7049011	It's based on a Neil Gaiman novel.
7049171	7051814	And I thought the movie turned out great.
7051874	7053835	Michelle Pfeiffer is great and all that.
7054276	7059441	But when I came home from watching the movie, I suddenly wanted to play Elder Scrolls Oblivion.
7060856	7062096	Like, it's kind of weird.
7062537	7064977	But that's the same type of thing that Red Entertainment's talking about.
7065258	7067538	Watching Game of Thrones made them want to play Dragon Age Origins.
7067598	7068199	Chair of Swords.
7068219	7076721	It's this weird kind of... For the record, reading Tolkien is torture.
7077022	7078182	It's going to take patience.
7079082	7082163	Good stories as long as you get past the descriptions of the countryside.
7083244	7083784	Just saying.
7084404	7086685	How about that whole Hobbit going into three movies?
7087668	7088408	I'm excited.
7089649	7091971	I read The Hobbit when I was a kid and I freaking love that book.
7091991	7093371	I guess they have enough to fill it with.
7093431	7093631	No.
7094072	7094352	Yeah?
7094692	7094892	No.
7094932	7095092	No.
7096473	7097594	That's three movies I don't have to see.
7099557	7100658	I like the original Lord of the Rings.
7100718	7101719	Anyway, let's go to Facebook.
7101739	7103460	Yeah, I love the whole original 20 ending.
7103480	7104201	Princess Bride.
7104561	7105062	There's something.
7105162	7105942	Let's go to Facebook.
7105962	7106543	This might surprise you.
7106583	7110006	Again, games you didn't fall in love with until second or third time you played it.
7110506	7110966	Shane.
7111026	7111727	Y'all know Shane.
7112187	7113448	You should be in chat.
7113729	7115350	I think he's rating or something tonight.
7115650	7116691	This answer might surprise you.
7116991	7117552	Mass Effect.
7117972	7118493	No joke.
7119153	7123716	Way back when the first game was on Xbox 360, I gave it a go because of all the things people were saying.
7124016	7126558	I didn't make it past Eden Prime before I decided it was dumb.
7127018	7131962	Years later, I got a free copy of 2 on PC for buying Dragon Age 2, so I gave it a go and thought it was pretty eh.
7132402	7136344	I didn't even get much farther than the opening escape from the Cerberus base before I just quit caring.
7136885	7141588	A short time later, I picked up the first game because I figured I should have the collection on PC for some reason.
7141928	7144290	I made it past Eden Prime this time, but again, didn't care.
7144890	7147794	And then the trailers for Mass Effect 3 came out and I thought it looked so cool.
7148114	7150897	I forced myself to get in the first game and something just clicked.
7151258	7153120	It was amazing and I couldn't stop playing.
7153460	7155623	And then things made much more sense in 2.
7156003	7156904	It was fantastic.
7157244	7159447	And that's how I came to love the greatest game series ever.
7159707	7160548	So, Mass Effect.
7162210	7162611	Let's see.
7163011	7164052	Osfer replied and said...
7164933	7165294	Going to Mary.
7182154	7184215	Yay for second chances and wow
7209463	7229344	Cody T replies it would probably have to be the Call of Duty games I tried to play them a long time ago and never really understood why people thought they were so fun until I had a child and didn't get as much time to play video games and those games multiplayer wise are easy to pick up and play for 5 or 10 minutes and another is Borderlands for the same reason I'm not that good at FPS games lol
7230405	7231266	Ragenator says,
7253185	7253545	Let's see.
7253745	7254786	Degenerate Johnny says,
7281454	7282315	Thank you for watching!
7300183	7300423	DarkSakura.
7300463	7300523	Wow.
7316817	7317338	Easy for you.
7317358	7317798	I know.
7317898	7324202	Well, moving off of WoW, because honestly it was really until they tweaked the gameplay to where I liked it.
7325003	7328945	I'm actually going to add Mass Effect on the list because I'd watched Dan play through it at first.
7329386	7330586	And I was like, oh, this is kind of boring.
7330606	7331767	First person shooters make me sick.
7331827	7332548	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7333488	7341413	and honestly, I had a hard time getting into it on Xbox until I started playing on PC and then, boom, all the way through the game, all the way through the second one, all the way through the third one.
7341773	7343434	I beat all three games in the span of a month.
7344074	7344495	Just saying.
7345455	7346796	And I'm still playing Mass Effect 3 again.
7347917	7348217	Loki?
7349518	7350558	Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
7352239	7353480	I didn't like it the first time I played it.
7353540	7354300	What clicked for you?
7354701	7355021	I don't know.
7357296	7384814	something uh for me most of mine have already been said believe it or not World of Warcraft the first time I played it I left for a while didn't end up coming back till Burning Crusade and then that's when I fell in love with it um Mass Effect is a big one because I played that and you know passed off my review of it sometime excuse me some time ago and then just came back and loved it and I don't even know what clicked I think I just I played from the beginning instead of in the middle and that made a huge difference yeah
7385638	7386860	Actually, you know what I have to say?
7387220	7387561	Geras.
7389203	7390625	Minecraft is another big one.
7390946	7396314	If I have to name one that hasn't been named yet, maybe you'll come sometime.
7396354	7398517	I've tried Minecraft and I really do not care for it.
7398617	7399038	We'll see.
7400159	7401481	I would say Halo.
7402382	7421716	Halo I didn't like the first time I played it because like first person shooter controller but it was the first time I did an LAN local area network because remember the first Halo wasn't on Xbox Live it wasn't around yet when I played that first Halo in a local area network oh it was awesome so awesome Bradley anything that comes to mind for you
7422524	7425425	There's nothing I can say that's all the way.
7425485	7427106	I hated it to have loved it.
7427206	7428907	But there was one game I played.
7429107	7431868	I started the game Adam Zombie Smasher.
7431908	7435009	I played a demo of it at PAX last year.
7435629	7439291	And there was a guy there that kind of threw you in, and I didn't know how to play it.
7439371	7441732	And so I said, I don't feel like playing this game.
7442232	7444493	But it came up in one of the Humble bundles, and I tried to play it.
7444993	7447814	And it starts you off from just doing one thing rather than several things.
7447914	7449575	So I basically...
7450356	7454326	Got into it for a little while when I played it there and went through and beat the game.
7454968	7458717	That was one that came with I don't care to actually like the game pretty well.
7460566	7461407	Alright, very cool.
7462067	7462468	Very cool.
7462488	7467211	Well, thank you guys again for answering on Facebook and Google, and of course, those of y'all here in studio.
7469353	7476059	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SUGAR.
7476879	7478421	We will continue on with some news.
7478521	7484886	We do have the Mailbag, FUs of the Week, and Twitter topics, Skype line, all those ways to interact coming right up.
7484926	7486187	But first, more news.
7486447	7486707	Loki.
7487788	7493776	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Steam.
7494377	7499023	And I know I purchased a few things on the Steam sale during the summer here.
7500244	7503448	I did also happen to see the update to the...
7505888	7507829	The terms of service that they have.
7508629	7517511	Now they have you agree to a Steam subscriber agreement that basically bars you from filing a class action lawsuit.
7520332	7522973	Kind of similar to what we saw with Sony and Microsoft.
7523933	7543403	and of course you know they said we've considered this change very carefully it's clear to us in some situations class actions have the real benefit to the consumer in far too many cases however class actions don't provide any real benefit to users and instead impose unnecessary expense and delay and are often designed to benefit the class action lawyers who craft and litigate these claims
7545322	7574334	you know I gotta say at least it was a very honest as far as corporate can be a very honest letter which you know we kind of Valve's been pretty good about communicating with their community they really have you know especially through some of the other you know like when they were hacked and all that they were pretty transparent with all that and that it's happening here too I don't know how I feel about this I mean obviously this is the trend in the gaming industry I gotta admit there's still a part of me that wonders if that can really hold up in court
7575354	7578939	I understand they're doing it to cover their butts but can it really hold up in court?
7578999	7579940	I don't think it's been tested yet.
7579960	7584165	You can still file a lawsuit against them but you just can't do it as a group.
7585481	7589624	Right, but I'm just saying, does that necessarily stop it?
7590265	7594788	I mean, do they have the power to put that in agreement and force you to agree to that?
7595128	7597350	You're waiving your right to sue us a group?
7597851	7600513	I'm surprised that hasn't been tested yet, and I think it will be.
7600533	7606577	I would think it's going to be a little bit difficult with them, too, because you bought all these games.
7606898	7607838	They give you no warning.
7608459	7612362	I mean, I guess it would be in the end-user license agreement that, oh, you can change this at any time.
7612862	7616104	All of a sudden, no, I can't use these games unless I agree to this.
7616645	7619327	I would think that a judge would see that as unreasonable.
7621688	7631855	You can't expect to just all of a sudden cut off the service that this user has paid for because you just put this clause in place that they don't want to agree to all of a sudden.
7632235	7633817	It's kind of ridiculous.
7633837	7634117	I don't know.
7635104	7640525	I guess there's that part of me that says, why do we let corporations dictate what rights we do and don't have?
7640605	7645187	And I totally understand the viewpoint of, well, then don't agree to it or whatever.
7645267	7652848	But yeah, didn't somebody say – maybe I saw it on Reddit or something or saw it somewhere where somebody was like, well, what happens if I don't agree to it?
7652888	7654369	Do I get to access my games anymore?
7654389	7655589	And the answer was essentially no.
7656729	7660290	So would that hold up in court?
7660450	7661230	I'm not so sure.
7662931	7663831	I guess maybe I'm just –
7665205	7667167	I don't know, trying to root for the little guy or whatever.
7683723	7684424	Thanks for watching!
7699093	7705676	So that I don't really understand if that's the case, but like something that they force you to read every time you play the game or something like that.
7705976	7706937	I don't know, maybe.
7707077	7708017	I don't really know how it works.
7708578	7713100	GameGuru in chat, good point from GameGuru at live.vognetwork.com, says it has been tested.
7713140	7718863	The Supreme Court ruled for them, hence why everyone's added no class action lawsuits clauses.
7719940	7748273	that's right I think it was an AT&T thing if I remember right I totally understand that but I just think if something bad enough happens it's really going to put this to the test and maybe that particular scenario wasn't the right scenario I totally understand why they want to block all this frivolous lawsuit crap and there are a lot of very frivolous class action lawsuits I get that but if something really bad happens I don't know maybe there's that tinfoil hat part of me that wonders why does Valve feel the need to do this
7749847	7751047	What news is about to come out?
7752728	7756068	Maybe it's the whole lawsuit that was in Europe.
7757149	7757529	Perhaps.
7757889	7760609	The whole, you know, use games thing.
7760669	7763150	Maybe they're just trying to prevent something like that happening over here.
7763350	7763850	Interesting.
7764370	7764930	Interesting thought.
7766191	7769651	Why did you make me buy so many cheap games during the summer sale?
7769771	7772712	I'm going to sue you because I'm irresponsible.
7774218	7776340	Alright, we'll see what develops with this as we move on.
7776360	7783686	You know, most people are pretty forgiving of Steam, but certainly there's going to be a few people like that guy who tried to get around it.
7783746	7785527	Was there a postcard clause or any of that?
7785547	7786168	I don't think there was.
7788232	7789113	EASports Season Ticket Free DLC
7808892	7814333	You get free packs of cards for Madden, FIFA, and NHL Ultimate Team Modes.
7814793	7817134	Do the sports games work like Mass Effect 3?
7817754	7824596	Where you open up the boxes and get cards and they are like... Like in Mass Effect 3, it's weapons and team members and stuff.
7824676	7825116	Is that?
7825256	7825456	No.
7825736	7826796	Because that's another EA game.
7826856	7826996	No?
7828096	7828676	I have to be honest.
7828696	7829417	I don't play these games.
7829457	7831297	So what is this card thing in Madden?
7831977	7835718	The card thing in Madden is for... Remember how there was the whole FIFA hacks?
7835738	7835818	Yeah.
7836379	7837885	They have that, the ultimate team thing?
7837905	7838989	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7839049	7840113	That's the Madden version of it.
7840253	7841297	What do those cards get you?
7841730	7842310	and DarkSakura.com.
7870146	7880651	A few days before they would come out, you would get a digital version that you would play, and then you'd go purchase the real game on the release day, and then that digital version would stop working.
7881831	7889175	Other things the season ticket had done in the past, early access to full titles that got deleted when the games were actually released.
7889915	7890275	Interesting.
7891115	7893957	And it used to be discounts on premium content, but now it's...
7894777	7895317	A little different.
7895378	7901161	They're saying, though, that the only way you'd actually be able to pay for it is if you bought all of the DLC.
7901881	7903302	Which I'm sure they'd love to have you do.
7904763	7906804	SJ100Matt says, Rob, yep, you are correct.
7906864	7908585	It's the same thing in the NHL games now.
7909045	7916350	BlackWolf says, you can use real money to buy new cards, but there was an in-game auction house that uses the point system that you get for playing Ultimate Team.
7917070	7922073	Live.VogNetwork.com And Monty Boggs, great comment, hard to call it free if it costs $30. $30.
7924074	7946973	that is true it's like PlayStation Plus but I see I like PlayStation Plus I think PlayStation Plus that whole thing's really come a long way and it's got a lot of value I gotta say it's interesting interesting we'll see how many people sign up for it I'm sure there's enough if they're continuing into a second year from the first year meanwhile some more news stories for you guys DarkSakura
7947364	7947644	Yes.
7948105	7957370	In other news, we actually have some Mass Effect goodies about the Wii U, which is kind of eye-rolly every time I think of the Wii U, but I'll go ahead.
7958531	7965796	It's going to basically have touchscreen controls so that you can see a map of your immediate areas where your squad mates are and where the enemies are highlighted.
7966716	7993082	you have four powers and abilities that are on each side of the gamepad screen so you can just select one without having to go to your quick menu although honestly my quick menu is my friend I'm like pause hold this pause basically it was also at the EA Summer Showcase where they had the first viewing of Mass Effect 3 on Wii U but the graphics are pretty much going to be the same as how they were on the PS3 and Xbox 360 version
7994242	7995123	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8012085	8014427	That's good to know, because we wanted to know how that was going to work.
8014527	8016789	Like, how are they going to catch the Nintendo fans up?
8017349	8019031	And then this is the thing that makes me happy.
8019631	8020992	Mass Effect 3 Leviathan.
8021052	8024075	There's Reaper DLC that's going to come out.
8024355	8026157	You get to shoot Reapers in the face.
8027077	8028979	Well, I'm looking forward to shooting a Reaper in the face.
8029639	8032041	It's about time for some single-player DLC, too.
8032101	8036665	Like, I realize the whole extended cut set everything back, but I've been foaming at the mouth for DLC.
8036685	8038166	It's almost been six months since the game came out.
8038186	8039988	But they were saying that it's supposed to also affect the ending.
8041511	8042251	I can see that.
8042391	8044091	Like maybe an extra little cutaway or something.
8044172	8047392	I don't think it's going to be like a five second cutaway or something.
8047752	8048792	I don't think it'll be anything major.
8048812	8052113	I'm just trying to see when the release date for that one was.
8052233	8054353	And I had seen it before and completely missed it.
8055474	8058754	But in fact, I'm double checking.
8059114	8064215	Here's what I really want to know about the Reaper ending or this Leviathan based ending without spoiling too much.
8064655	8067916	Will you still cry when Edie dot dot dot
8069384	8070627	I cried so much.
8070907	8075796	But I more cried over Garrus, because keep in mind... Keep in mind, I started with the extended cut.
8076946	8077506	When I played it.
8077967	8080909	And the whole little goodbye part on the Normandy.
8083691	8085853	I just, like, I'm not going to spoil anything.
8085913	8087014	And it's not, I will say this.
8087094	8088675	I'm not talking about dies.
8088735	8090417	Like, I know a lot of people are like, oh, great, Rob.
8090457	8090877	It's dies.
8090937	8091718	Nope, that's not it.
8092198	8094059	If you've beaten the game, you know what I'm talking about.
8094260	8098863	One of the particular endings, there's a moment when Edie and dot, dot, dot.
8099143	8099824	And it's like, oh.
8103126	8103427	Yeah.
8104067	8105048	It's a little bit of a klempt.
8106024	8116216	Well, they said on here also that they actually said there were some things leaked in the script that actually link it to the extended cut.
8119400	8119740	All right.
8120061	8120301	Loki.
8120321	8120401	Loki.
8122099	8124262	Patents Connect Patents
8137501	8144590	This is kind of weird, too, because this patent basically allows taking Kinect, I guess, into mobile cameras.
8145091	8151899	So allowing you to use your phone or something like that to basically scan people into...
8153593	8154094	DarkSakura,
8175657	8194393	and they said the visual mapping isn't enough the camera relies on motion sensor like an accelerometer to better judge its position as it's moved around and that's interesting does this mean the next Windows phone is going to have Kinect built in for no particular reason but maybe to take like a 3D picture of my face
8195450	8195810	Maybe.
8196210	8204314	They also filed another patent that basically uses the Kinect for, I guess, directing movies.
8204354	8209836	You can use your hands to gesture to do different movie editing stuff.
8210957	8219280	Also, I guess, the depth camera both generates the model environment and also creates 3D props out of real objects, so augmented reality stuff.
8220000	8223182	Motion capture and, I guess...
8226158	8228559	Doing other augmented reality stuff.
8229119	8232901	That's kind of neat.
8233482	8233942	Interesting.
8235142	8239544	I mean, a lot of people have been trying to do video stuff with a lot of augmented reality stuff.
8240165	8251270	And that would kind of tie in with the supposedly leaked plan or their timeline or whatever that they were planning on doing in the next system with all that crazy Kinect stuff.
8254740	8265468	DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says, I would love to have the ability to have my in-game character look like me via image capture.
8265788	8269050	Don't they have that on the 3DS, and doesn't it not work very well?
8270691	8272232	Yeah, pretty much.
8272873	8277576	But the 3DS, remember, it has that front camera, but the front's not 3D, only the back.
8277816	8280097	I mean, there's three cameras in the 3DS, if you think about it.
8280198	8282019	One in the front, two in the back for 3D images.
8282459	8283640	It's a little, you know.
8285330	8296205	Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo and patents, I don't know if you guys remember this, but Copper Innovations Group filed a lawsuit against Nintendo.
8296225	8297627	It was a patent lawsuit back in 2008.
8299915	8301436	and it's just now over.
8301917	8314827	To remind you, because you probably forgot, Copper Innovations Group claimed that the Wiimote and the Wii console infringed on a 1996 patent for quote, handheld computer input apparatus and method.
8316729	8317770	This looks like a mouse.
8318110	8319532	You look at the little figures, whatever.
8319632	8322174	Anyway, Pittsburgh U.S.
8322234	8329481	District Court basically found it in Nintendo's favor, halting the need for a jury trial.
8330422	8334887	Nintendo, of course, is pleased with the decision and thanks their legal team and so forth.
8334947	8338750	I think most of us saw this as a patent troll type of thing.
8340182	8341643	There's a lot of these type of lawsuits.
8341703	8345125	That took four years to resolve and it hadn't even gone to jury yet.
8345225	8347027	It actually got cut off before it went to jury.
8347087	8350269	The judge basically said, nah, nah.
8352210	8352750	Amazing.
8353791	8356213	The legal system in this country is so interesting.
8358754	8362937	I know I'm not a lawyer, but that doesn't stop everybody on the internet from pretending to be one.
8364598	8365979	Let's get to the mailbag.
8366480	8366920	Oh, joy.
8366940	8367620	Oh, joy.
8369833	8372094	Let's see what homemade lawyers we have.
8372114	8372494	Oh, boy.
8373294	8375775	I don't know what is wrong with my talking ability lately.
8376175	8376455	All right.
8376575	8377575	You are speaking English good.
8378236	8378716	Clearly.
8378736	8379336	All right.
8379396	8380196	Slow down, Rob.
8380276	8380536	All right.
8381057	8384858	We're going to go to the mailbag and see what homemade lawyers we have in the email bag this week.
8384918	8388859	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to email the show.
8389341	8397885	I'm just going to start with one from Steven W. Home does get a bad rep from how it used to be back in the day to what it is currently going down with its updates.
8398225	8404628	With the recent updates and fixes, they have pushed out some really good content and finally fixed the glitch that allowed users freezing others.
8405228	8406489	Does Home still have its issues?
8406709	8411051	Why, yes it does, but it does what comes when software is still in beta.
8411991	8413532	Sorry, this is very run-on sentency.
8414152	8416732	Home is constantly evolving, and with evolution comes bugs.
8417373	8424134	If you look past those bugs and look at the community, the atmosphere surrounding it, and all of the events slash games within Home, you see how epic it is.
8424834	8428996	So yes, Home gets a bad rep, but it has a lot of good inside of it.
8429536	8430056	Who does it?
8430096	8430976	Does it like a pinata?
8431696	8434717	So everyone should hop on and check it out, even if it's for a few moments.
8435977	8437598	If I beat it with a stick, will candy come out?
8438378	8438418	No.
8438838	8439359	Possibly.
8439779	8441500	Somebody won a $20 gift card last week.
8442361	8443382	Of course, that had nothing.
8443642	8445063	That was not Sony sanction.
8445163	8448105	That was a generous fan helping another generous fan out.
8448506	8449887	But I'm glad to see... Good.
8450207	8455071	I'm glad some people followed through because I don't know if you remember, but during... Hey, it's not time for the FUs yet.
8455111	8455411	Be quiet.
8455851	8459134	During last week's show, I actually asked all those guys in PlayStation Home.
8459194	8460795	I said, does your network get a bad rap?
8461115	8462096	Does home get a bad rap?
8462717	8464898	So I'm glad somebody followed through with that.
8464958	8465799	Thank you for replying.
8466331	8466632	Okay.
8467413	8468816	Well, moving forward.
8469157	8469518	Hello.
8469698	8470901	This is from Nasty Canesta.
8472854	8473474	Hello, OLR.
8473575	8476076	One of my favorite nicknames, by the way, that emails the show.
8476277	8477778	Because I think about the card game Canasta.
8477798	8478058	I know.
8478158	8478958	I think of old people.
8479039	8481921	It's like strip Canasta or something.
8481941	8482901	It's time to get nasty.
8483642	8489987	I'm not sure if you covered this before, but you might be interested in a teaser for an upcoming PC first-person horror game called Among the Sleep.
8490447	8492548	The protagonist for Among the Sleep is a two-year-old.
8493209	8499794	Aside from the utter helplessness you have to deal with playing as this poor toddler, imagine if you also had to struggle with the baby's current developmental stage.
8500214	8506183	How could the game screw with you if this kid didn't grasp the concept of object permanence yet?
8506463	8506864	Scary!
8507344	8507605	P.S.
8507745	8508085	Garris?
8509467	8511971	Well, I think a two-year-old understands object permanence better.
8514516	8515777	says the parent of a two-year-old.
8515797	8523160	I actually peeked in the mailbag earlier and I watched the little trailer for this thing and it looks creepy as hell.
8523880	8527622	And that's a weird concept for a game to me.
8528122	8530463	When you do things about children, that's always a little creepy.
8530763	8532223	Yeah, I'd like to stay away from that.
8532303	8534844	At least the child doesn't get eaten by a grue or something.
8534904	8538866	It's just, you know, it was a scary looking game, I gotta say.
8540226	8541527	It's like amnesia level scary.
8543171	8545933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8564085	8587923	Armadillo which I don't think came out in the US and then Panic Restaurant which actually that is the US release and I went to find because I only remembered like half of the name because it was something Gourmet World it was One Paku Koku no Gourmet World and it came out in 1992 and was published by Taito where you play as a guy named Cookie who looks like Chef Boyardee
8588556	8590557	Not to be confused with the announcer from You Don't Know Jack.
8590838	8599103	This is one of those games that had one of those classic things of mistranslation of a name because the bad guy in the game was called O'Durf.
8600384	8601845	But it was French to Japanese.
8602245	8605888	So when it came to translating it from Japanese to English, they called him O'Duff.
8607089	8607289	Ha ha!
8610348	8611028	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8626737	8643663	it was a neat little game and it was by Sakura and then Armadillo was sort of like Super Mario 3 where you had like a map that you could move from world to world I know of all three of those games so yeah good job dude you can send me your copy of Armadillo if you want I'll play the fuck out of it
8645223	8649365	Um, so, uh, this is let me know your opinion and happy podcasting.
8649926	8651606	Um, Banana Prince is pretty, pretty fun.
8652587	8653848	Um, Armadillo is pretty fun.
8654528	8658030	I actually did not play Panic Restaurant, but I've seen it.
8658810	8661872	I've seen, I know someone who had Panic Restaurant when I was younger.
8662072	8664273	So just saying, I didn't get into it.
8665720	8667261	Okay, moving forward, shall I?
8668422	8669923	This comes from Clover Nikon.
8670904	8674766	Hi guys and gal, just writing in to say that I am loving the show and loving the VOG Network.
8675347	8678669	I have not been on the VOG site as much as I would like to due to my two jobs.
8679529	8688656	Anyway, today, August 6th, is my one year wedding anniversary and unfortunately my beautiful wife Lisa has to work so I'm spending my morning here with my friends at the VOG Network while I do CG renders.
8689317	8692824	Anyway, Lisa is playing Fable 2 Star Wars Connect and will soon play Mass Effect 2.
8692904	8695710	Hope everyone has a great evening and keep up the great radio.
8696110	8696912	Sent from my iPhone.
8698555	8699698	Well, happy anniversary.
8700475	8701315	Yay, anniversaries are great.
8701335	8706777	Sorry to hear that, you know, somebody's having to work during it, but, you know, you've got to make the money.
8707397	8708038	That's how it works.
8708198	8708458	Okay.
8708958	8709458	Next email.
8709658	8710178	We have two more.
8710358	8710699	Wait, wait, wait.
8710739	8713880	I was trying to find something for that last email here.
8714000	8714780	Hold on, hold on.
8715160	8716160	Better not be Happy Wedding.
8716721	8718201	No, no, no, no.
8718581	8721142	We already did Happy Wedding a couple weeks ago for Tiara and Dan.
8721902	8723503	This is the other song.
8737458	8738799	Remember Parapara Paradise?
8739099	8739599	Paradise?
8740420	8742761	Dave, Domino, and Virginelle anniversary.
8743481	8745903	There you go.
8746323	8747083	Happy anniversary.
8747824	8749885	I've just started my tour in the Mass Effect universe.
8750285	8753547	I have to say that I have owned both 1 and 2 on Steam for at least 2 years now.
8753747	8754407	I am hooked.
8755068	8757049	Played through the first one in about 22 hours.
8757149	8758170	I am absolutely in love.
8758890	8759870	This game is epic.
8759991	8765494	Honestly had chills from the first 2 minutes when 5 year later, spoiler alert, Shepard crawled out from the wreckage.
8766534	8781967	some things happen in my game that make me sit in my office during the day and question my decisions when one of my favorite characters was shot and killed I wanted so badly to reload my game and make different choices yet I didn't you totally could have
8782347	8798059	yeah I continued on letting the decisions I had made played out for the rest of the story my question is which choice based games such as KOTOR, Mass Effect, Heavy Rain, Fable do you go with your gut feeling and let the story play out as it will or try to change it in the way that you want it
8800260	8815145	Mass Effect I played I've actually played the second one the exact damn same way I played the last one my last playthrough on Mass Effect 3 the only thing that I changed was I killed Caden and played with Ashley using my save file editor just so I could see what Ashley was like in Mass Effect 3
8816065	8822448	I have to admit, Mass Effect was really the first game where I didn't feel this need to do everything perfect.
8822748	8832172	Because usually when I play RPGs, I'm kind of that anal retentive, search every corner, talk to every person in the town, explore every story, do every side quest.
8832732	8838595	And there comes a point when you're playing these Bioware games where you just have to realize you can't do that.
8839055	8840155	You cannot do it.
8840236	8842516	It is not possible without playing the game 500 times.
8843817	8857073	so Mass Effect was really one of the first games to kind of like get and I realize this is very recent but it's it's a different way of thinking for me so and it's not been easy so that's my long-winded answer
8859324	8875526	Well, I also did play Dragon Age 2, and I really liked it, but it was like, when I started romancing What's-Her-Name that was voiced by Eve Miles, I was like, oh my god, she's annoying, oh my god, she's annoying, so I started going after Fenris.
8876207	8878188	because I was like, ooh, he's kind of broody.
8878568	8879308	I'd go for Fenris.
8881749	8884370	I didn't really play the Fable games because I really didn't like them that much.
8884710	8886031	Dan played the crap out of them.
8886511	8887691	I started on Fable 2.
8888151	8892013	I liked Fable, but I never finished any of them, which is weird because I own them all.
8893915	8917889	um my favorite choice ever was how to bitch slap the bitch slap fight in Final Fantasy 7 just saying and those you know choose your the the little mud games or choosing who you would date in Final Fantasy 7 yeah trying to get the Barrett date fuck no it was always Tifa and I did not use that bitch Aerith more than I had to because she was a hoebag fuck her and now she's tell us how you really feel
8919695	8920915	I still have my save file.
8921456	8921856	I know.
8921876	8924836	Where I can kill her as much as I want to.
8924976	8926337	And the Jenova fight, which is fun.
8926717	8929458	That's like the most fun fight in the damn game is that Jenova fight.
8930478	8932178	Because I'm so giddy from her being dead.
8932278	8933559	Maybe you just like the music.
8934099	8937480	I really love the freaking... No.
8937640	8938640	I love the Jenova music.
8940080	8943563	I hate the Earth music because I hate everything about the bitch.
8943803	8947685	Anyway, also completely off topic, but I've ordered Sound Shapes.
8947785	8950107	Any of you guys played demos or have any thoughts about it?
8950627	8952548	I really needed something fresh on my Vita.
8952648	8955050	It's got an inch of dust and shame on it at the moment.
8955590	8956631	Dust and shame.
8957091	8957531	I like that.
8957551	8958812	Keep up the great work, Travis.
8960593	8961013	I like that.
8961093	8961754	Dust and shame.
8962579	8968704	I have not personally played Sound Shapes, but Shane, who's a friend of mine, will not shut up about how great it is.
8969004	8969645	Oh, is he in chat?
8969725	8972246	Maybe he'll call in later because apparently it's great.
8973007	8975269	And he says he's getting it launch day.
8975749	8979171	I don't know much about it, but Shane sure talks it up.
8979892	8980933	It makes me kind of want it.
8980973	8981753	I hope there's a demo.
8983334	8984195	There's Shane in chat.
8984275	8985256	Yes, Sound Shapes.
8986337	8986717	There you go.
8987992	8988512	Last email?
8988773	8989513	One more, alright.
8990013	8991033	Yeah, why not?
8992774	8995095	This is labeled bad rep.
8996355	9002517	Not all, but some clubs and especially fans slash mafias are a bad rep on home.
9003018	9006639	Other than that, home is a great place to have fun and to get away.
9007179	9011701	By the way, even though this has nothing to do with this, who's the porn star?
9011821	9012561	It could have been me.
9013962	9014922	That's from Skull King.
9015222	9016324	I just want to say Marissa's in chat.
9025396	9026237	Marissa, can I say?
9027038	9027858	Tell me if I can say.
9028259	9029960	It starts with a G. All right.
9029980	9030921	That's why you get a letter.
9031502	9034785	It's a G. It starts with a G. Like OG.
9034905	9036586	G would have wasted time I spent on Google.
9036947	9037247	All right.
9037427	9038208	Is that it for emails?
9038348	9038548	Yes.
9039109	9043052	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email for next week.
9043373	9044434	That was two home emails.
9044594	9044934	Thank you.
9045314	9046275	Thank you, kind emailers.
9047276	9057089	all of you that emailed from Mass Effect to Sound Shapes to PlayStation Home appreciate it let's get to the FUs of the week the part of the show where we get ranty why?
9057109	9058551	I don't know
9076178	9076558	FU.
9078259	9078979	So losing my job.
9080100	9081400	I really fucking liked that place.
9082281	9083521	I liked everyone I worked with.
9083922	9085102	I loved my cubicle.
9086083	9089424	I liked my Mass Effect wallpaper on my dual monitors.
9090845	9094586	But I'm really going to miss the people I worked with and I'm going to miss all the reps I worked with.
9095447	9096987	They were some awesome people.
9097508	9097948	Just saying.
9101055	9102915	I don't think I have to tell you what my FU is.
9103376	9106936	It's this whole debacle with this stupid Black Tiger score and stuff.
9108717	9120159	Dude, there was literally a forum thread on Twin Galaxies from the people that beat the fucking high score that actually set the goddamn world record that said, hey, the machine doesn't score right.
9120879	9122580	And yet they're not willing to do anything about it.
9122640	9123920	So fuck that shit, you know.
9125980	9127001	Way to go, Twin Galaxies.
9127261	9128321	Some integrity you got there.
9130919	9133281	Honestly, I don't have a lot to complain about.
9133321	9134542	Things are going pretty well for me.
9134802	9139705	F you to the lack of motivation I have to exercise, because I really need to get that done.
9140325	9146830	I need to join a gym or something, but I just know my lack of motivation too well.
9147478	9147798	Bradley.
9148499	9149979	Uh, fuck you to my bee-hurting.
9150159	9154862	At least I'm done with my hiking season for the most part.
9154902	9159584	Except for since I'm on later, just hopefully I won't hurt more later then.
9159684	9167087	Uh, and also fuck you to getting tired in the middle of the day after your lunch.
9167127	9170489	Like, uh, get all the work done.
9170529	9170669	Work.
9170689	9171790	Work's not that exciting.
9173110	9173931	That makes arguing harder.
9175774	9178115	Alright, there it is, EFU's The Week.
9182737	9183218	Moving on.
9185299	9186739	Let's do a couple more news stories.
9187680	9190521	And then we're going to get into Twitter topics, if we have any.
9190821	9192562	I didn't really make a lot of calls for them, but we'll see.
9192902	9193963	And then the Skype line.
9194463	9195464	And then the end of the show.
9196184	9198165	And then the Mars Curiosity Landing special.
9198965	9199066	Sweet.
9199086	9199946	What are you pointing at?
9202421	9203522	Oh, what is this?
9203562	9203963	What is this?
9204363	9205264	Let's discuss.
9206165	9206906	Let's discuss this.
9207667	9215695	I have a bag of stuff from Swag's kind of stuff from the last packs that I have sitting around on my table and I'm not going to do anything with it.
9215755	9218338	So I thought I'd bring it over here so you could give it away.
9219059	9219920	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9240377	9260485	A mouse pad for EVE Online, ShatteredCrystal.com, Combat Arms, World of Tanks Alright, so like a little mouse pad Let me look Take it all out, Rob They actually had a tank there at the opening Yeah, whip it out, Rob There's a lot of postcards and brochures and things
9261348	9261628	Yeah.
9262729	9263989	Maybe some codes in here.
9264009	9265129	Why not just dump the bag out?
9265570	9267850	Because I don't want to do that because then I have to put it all back in the bag.
9268511	9268951	Lazy?
9269931	9270671	Some stickers.
9271632	9272412	Some sort of thing.
9272432	9273332	Is that a tattoo?
9273613	9274173	What is this?
9275453	9276013	Air Mac.
9276254	9277114	Oh, it's like a business card.
9277134	9277834	A little QR code.
9278074	9278774	All right, cool.
9278874	9279115	Hold on.
9279135	9282216	There's like one thing that I got at the harmonics panel.
9282456	9283076	Grab that thing.
9283316	9283676	Let's see.
9283696	9284857	It's a chain sort of thing.
9286824	9287245	Uh-huh.
9288507	9289950	Holy crap, this thing's heavy.
9291192	9292254	What the hell is this?
9293251	9295073	It's a weird Dance Central chain thing.
9295673	9299717	Oh, that's like... You can wear the chain like they wear in Dance Central.
9300918	9302919	That is fucking hilarious.
9303119	9303680	I love that.
9304020	9307844	All right, so how do... Yeah, unfortunately, I can only stay there, pan off like 10 minutes.
9307944	9310246	How are we going to give away this bag of crap this week?
9310406	9311807	I need to think of something.
9311887	9312207	All right.
9314569	9317932	How about we make a forum post and...
9319053	9334229	I'll make a forum post after the show because I want something the podcasties can participate in too I want the live listeners and the podcasties to have a chance at it so we'll say we're going to do a forum post and we'll do something about if you're not going to PAX this year
9335532	9337194	What are you going to do instead or something?
9337214	9337515	I don't know.
9337535	9348468	I'll come up with something and we'll have a question and we'll pick one random answer on the forums and give away Bradley's bag of crap from PAX and you won't even have to pay shipping.
9348508	9350711	Shipping will be covered by OLR because we're generous and kind.
9351291	9351672	There you go.
9354844	9362209	I'm looking in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com DJ Morpheus says, F you to not hearing Bradley.
9362529	9364250	He's just a quiet guy.
9364290	9365471	He's just soft-spoken.
9365911	9368953	He's not as loud and obnoxious as the other rest of us.
9369754	9370474	Right, DarkSakura?
9371315	9371595	What?
9372176	9372596	Exactly.
9372616	9373236	Excuse me?
9374617	9375278	You did not.
9376278	9377019	Oh, yes, I did.
9379361	9379741	All right.
9380623	9381064	Oh, girl.
9381524	9381725	No.
9383067	9385570	DJ Morpheus says, is it a bag of shit?
9386011	9386432	Kind of.
9388074	9389997	But, dude, Dance Central chain.
9391720	9392040	All right.
9393915	9396597	Monty Boggs says, I didn't even know VOG had a forum.
9396717	9397138	I fail.
9397498	9399159	That's the point of the contest.
9399180	9399920	See what I'm doing?
9399960	9401561	I'm driving traffic to the forums.
9401682	9402122	Get it?
9402562	9402903	Get it?
9402963	9404444	Maybe we'll throw in another prize or two.
9404504	9404764	All right.
9405124	9410549	So win Bradley's bag of shit from PAX featuring Dance Central Chains and Whoopie Cushions.
9411730	9415393	Enter on the forums after the podcast goes up tonight, live listeners.
9415573	9417655	Keep an eye out on the forums at vognetwork.com.
9418260	9420421	All right, let us move on.
9421002	9423143	Some folks in chat talking about E3 swag.
9423323	9423803	Not anymore.
9424824	9427525	E3 swag, that was E3 circa like 2003.
9428826	9430847	Now it's all go on our website.
9430907	9433069	Here's a business card with a link to our website.
9433349	9435950	Here's a QR code to scan to get on our mailing list.
9436210	9437611	They don't really give away stuff anymore.
9438592	9441453	When the economy got tight, those are the first things to go.
9442074	9442674	Sorry to say.
9444055	9445156	Okay, Loki, news stories.
9445976	9451760	Hey, it's been a show where we haven't mentioned the Ouya yet, so let's mention the Ouya.
9452060	9452601	God damn it.
9453621	9454042	It's all right.
9454142	9455022	Hey, there's good stuff.
9455442	9456963	So, Ouya, they've got a few things.
9457044	9461146	Obviously, they're kicking starters running through, I believe, this week.
9461186	9462007	I think it ends this week.
9462687	9467891	And they've added a few things, including you can get a special edition console if you pledge $140.
9468291	9473014	And it's slightly darker metal.
9473414	9475416	I kind of like it, but I'm not going to pledge any extra money.
9477777	9481739	Also, Shadowrun Online has been confirmed to be getting Ouya support.
9482180	9485101	I'm assuming that's, of course, if they hit their Kickstarter goal.
9486963	9493266	Final Fantasy 3 is going to be one of the launch titles for the Ouya, which is kind of interesting.
9493767	9498669	Of course, that was just recently released on Android, but they will be doing a version for the Ouya.
9500030	9520107	um kind of neat and then um also iHeartRadio has been confirmed as one of the apps on there and then there's a game called Offensive Combat that's getting a port to um oh yeah as well that's um kind of like a Call of Duty type of game first person shooter so neat
9522452	9523933	Neat indeed, I guess.
9525014	9527256	I'm still waiting for the OUYA to hit the shelves, that's all.
9527336	9529158	But their Kickstarter's doing very well.
9529818	9533261	Yeah, and they've got some of the people backing it.
9533281	9534643	Square Enix is kind of interesting.
9534803	9537585	Now it's all about, will it come out on time?
9538046	9540368	The countdown is beginning.
9541128	9544191	Because now aren't they offering limited edition colors and...
9544983	9552263	Well, it's more expensive because it's going to be a limited run, and so because they're producing less units, it's going to cost a little bit more.
9555157	9578983	all right one more news story for you guys tonight and then the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on skype orange lounge radio opening right after this story and this is one of those wow i uh i'm not sure i believe this is happening but it's happening a new game coming out for the wii note that's not wii u it's the wii and it's happening on september 14th
9580797	9587959	Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals Sing and Dance coming out on the Wii I think I know who's putting this out too September 14th who?
9588619	9608185	I think it's oh god now I'm gonna forget it's not City Interactive O Games Oxygen Games is the one putting this out because they had well they had a game called Everyone's Sing and Dance and I believe that they picked up licensing now for this if I already guessed
9610385	9610926	Interesting.
9611106	9626021	Because in kind of a similar story, you know how they have that Marvel Avengers game that's coming out that kind of looks a little similar to that Ubisoft fighting game that they have, like another superhero game?
9626897	9635023	Well, that's actually the sequel to that because it was just going to be Power Up Heroes 2, but then they got the Marvel licensing, so they skinned it.
9635043	9637405	All right, I want to talk about Andrew Lloyd Webber, though.
9637545	9640247	This game is coming out September 14th.
9640547	9642989	32 classic hits from 13 musicals.
9643429	9655177	You can sing and dance to Don't Cry For Me, Argentina from Evita, Superstar from Jesus Christ Superstar, and All I Ask of You from The Phantom of the Opera.
9655898	9655978	Man.
9658502	9659703	I'm sure that's in there too.
9660003	9661144	Here's my question.
9661164	9663026	The game is called sing and dance.
9663866	9666188	How the fuck do you dance to any of those songs?
9666248	9670572	I've seen Cats and all she does is shuffle across the stage and pose a lot.
9670732	9673434	Or I think of Madonna in Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
9673474	9673954	What did she do?
9673994	9675876	She was in the balcony with her hands.
9676236	9679539	Or you take the Wiimote with your hands and point to the subjects.
9680580	9684123	Don't cry for me Argentina.
9684143	9685704	It's like, good lord.
9688908	9698256	I still kind of want to buy it and have Loki play it on the show it would be interesting to do a whole segment of drunk people performing the musicals
9701112	9706776	Poor Andrew Lloyd Webber because he doesn't know about how bastardized his musical songs are about to become.
9707317	9708658	I love the Phantom of the Opera.
9709198	9710359	It's a great musical.
9710439	9711540	I've seen it a few times.
9711580	9712781	The sensitive side of Loki.
9712801	9715403	Have you seen the movie that came out a couple years ago?
9715663	9716623	Yeah, I did see the movie.
9716643	9717664	I went to the theaters to see that.
9717684	9718385	It wasn't bad, huh?
9718725	9720726	I liked it.
9721147	9722528	It's a great opera.
9723208	9725690	I've seen Wicked was good.
9726070	9729473	I even got dragged to A Light in the Piazza which is
9731101	9732783	Spamalot Tim Curry King Arthur
9755819	9775428	Tim Korean, anything, awesome I was given very bad news Oh, Black Wolf's got a good point, Book of Mormon I'm sure is one you might enjoy Avenue Q is great too But one bit of sad news I got this week, thanks to SSJ100 Matt, you jerk Sister Act is closing on Broadway at the end of this month Really?
9775488	9776189	You're surprised?
9777630	9778150	A little bit.
9778451	9779372	Didn't it win Tony's?
9780052	9780953	It's going to tour, though.
9781033	9781614	It's going to tour.
9781654	9788341	So I'm going to say a little prayer that Sister Act will end up in San Francisco.
9788882	9789602	Or Sacramento.
9789622	9790243	How can it not?
9790764	9791344	You never know.
9791404	9791805	It might.
9792445	9793507	We got the Lion King.
9794728	9795809	Well, now we have that.
9796350	9798432	Not only do we have that now, but they have the kind of...
9799401	9802203	Off, Off, Off, Off, Off Broadway stuff now.
9802283	9807006	So they have, like, you know, the three stages, which is in our, like, Folsom.
9807026	9809488	They've got Davis and stuff like that.
9809568	9810649	Yeah, like Music Circus.
9811329	9811829	Sort of.
9811930	9813991	Yeah, but they do, I mean, they do, like, Wicked and stuff.
9814011	9814852	A Family Friend.
9815652	9819676	A family friend, their little girl was in Little Orphan Annie, and I think that was the last musical I went to see.
9819736	9821077	Yeah, they did The Lion King.
9821197	9827843	I just don't know, you know, is that the same Lion King, or are we seeing, like, high school production of The Lion King?
9827883	9832006	Okay, Tigerclaw in chat says, but the costumes for The Lion King musical are crappy, though.
9832106	9834749	Okay, you and I clearly didn't see the same production.
9835149	9841775	Like, you must have seen community theater Lion King, because the costumes and the puppetry and all, that's what it's all about.
9841895	9843236	Like, if you don't have good costumes...
9843516	9844317	The Lion King is screwed.
9844357	9845758	What about Evil Dead the musical?
9845859	9846760	That would be awesome too.
9846940	9847600	That exists.
9847741	9848021	I know.
9848041	9850624	That's why I did it in San Jose.
9850644	9856610	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio if you want to give us a call right now or Loki and I can just sit here and talk about musicals.
9856670	9857051	It's cool.
9858632	9861575	Loki, do you have any other last minute stories before we...
9862792	9866294	There was some stuff about... There was another Kickstarter project that's going on.
9866314	9866754	It's cool.
9866774	9869495	It's for the heads-up display.
9869515	9874457	It's a virtual reality display that's being backed by id Software and stuff like that.
9874537	9875637	So that might be something cool.
9875657	9875837	Hold up.
9875877	9880659	I never realized your picture was on the ErnestKlein.com website.
9880739	9881099	Yes, it is.
9881119	9882700	But somebody linked it in chat.
9883080	9885181	And my favorite is that your face...
9885521	9886301	You're so fucking mad.
9886341	9889142	Oh, I was so pissed off at that fucking thing.
9889162	9891003	I purposefully looked angry at that.
9891023	9892183	Thank you, Texas, for linking that.
9892203	9892583	Thank you so much.
9892603	9895144	There's another one on there that I looked tired because I was playing.
9895304	9899066	There's one for the Atari 2600 game from Gate 1.
9899126	9901746	I was number 159, so you can look up the picture for that, too.
9901766	9903227	All right, we've got a million calls coming in.
9903267	9904087	I need to get some calls.
9904147	9905168	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9905188	9905608	Who's this?
9906588	9907508	Oh, hi, it's Panaxium.
9907688	9908829	Panaxium, what's up?
9909969	9911610	Oh, hey, I actually finally got through.
9911650	9912751	How about that?
9912831	9914032	Long-time listener, first-time caller?
9914993	9915474	Yes, actually.
9915534	9916234	My favorite.
9916534	9917555	Well, welcome to the show.
9918396	9918916	Oh, thank you.
9919017	9921018	And I love your little Skype icon.
9922219	9924261	That is the best squirrel in the universe.
9925762	9927263	Is that like the epic Iron Man squirrel?
9927343	9931667	I wish it was a video show sometime so you all could see that because that's cracking my shit up.
9931727	9934629	All right, Panaxian, to what do we owe this phone call tonight?
9934649	9935090	What's on your mind?
9936011	9941358	Oh, actually, I just got done playing a game recently that I think is awesome, and I don't know if you guys have covered it before.
9942660	9945764	It is Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet.
9947170	9948011	I've wanted to play it.
9948431	9950992	I bought it, and I don't think I've played it yet.
9951272	9951832	I bought it.
9951972	9964637	I haven't finished it yet, but it was one of the closest, like, Super Metroid-esque games I've played in a very long time that actually kind of, like, took me back to how good, like, outside of, like, Castlevania, right?
9965077	9968799	Like, took me back to how freaking good Super Metroid was.
9968899	9970500	Like, it really kind of took me back to that.
9970520	9972600	But then I got to admit, I don't know if you know this.
9972780	9973861	Where are you from, Panaxium?
9974819	9975299	Colorado.
9975460	9976000	Okay, Colorado.
9976020	9977461	Do you have Del Taco in Colorado?
9978161	9978401	Yes.
9978601	9978821	Okay.
9979102	9982764	Del Taco did an insanely twisted Shadow Planet promotion.
9983124	9984685	And I was like, what?
9985565	9986326	No way, really?
9986886	9987366	Yes.
9987867	9992509	It was like, buy a taco, get an insanely twisted Shadow Planet cup.
9992570	9993170	And I was like...
9994531	9995552	I have never heard of this.
9995572	9997455	So Call of Duty was unavailable, huh?
9997795	9997975	Yeah.
9998236	10003702	It's not there anymore, but it was like six months after the game had come out.
10003822	10005424	It was so fucking random.
10005985	10006926	Google it or something.
10006986	10007426	I don't know.
10008027	10008768	That's really weird.
10009849	10012993	But yeah, I was just calling because I thought that game was just amazing.
10013073	10014435	I loved the art style of it.
10015759	10034308	and uh just the gameplay just kind of like you said it took me back and I was like wow they just don't make games like this anymore well I guess they do because it's out so did they ever do the DLC for that I heard there was supposed to be DLC coming out but I don't remember reading about it uh I don't know actually huh yeah Loki yeah DLC came out for it oh did it yeah oh good
10035573	10038834	I know it has some multiplayer stuff, but I actually got a chance to try it.
10038854	10040274	I think it's on Steam too, maybe.
10040494	10041834	Or they have a PC version.
10041994	10043274	Yeah, there's like a PC version now.
10043314	10045915	The original one was on Xbox Live Arcade, but that's awesome.
10046435	10049835	So yes, yes, I am familiar with Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, and it's a good pick.
10051296	10052036	Yeah, definitely.
10053616	10054836	Anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?
10055536	10061777	No, just wanted to pop in and say hi, because I've been meaning to call in to you guys for quite a while, and I just never get around to it.
10061958	10062998	You have a wonderful voice.
10063138	10063478	Well, hi.
10063518	10064198	You should do radio.
10067383	10067743	Thank you.
10069104	10069865	You're welcome.
10069885	10072807	You just made him blush a little bit, DarkSakura.
10073427	10074948	She hasn't talked to the callers often.
10074988	10075869	She's a little stuck up.
10076289	10077049	I am not.
10077490	10078050	I'm just kidding.
10078070	10079271	I'm judging you a lot right now.
10080552	10080852	All right.
10081252	10084494	Y'all can't see it on the radio, but I'm giving Rob the look of judgment.
10084995	10086356	Should I get the people's court theme up again?
10086916	10087116	No.
10087617	10088017	Oh, boy.
10088857	10092120	Panaxium, thanks so much for the call, and glad we can make you blush.
10093360	10094461	Well, I'm honored.
10094721	10095001	All right.
10095142	10095762	Take care, buddy.
10096482	10096743	Bye.
10096963	10097203	Bye.
10100270	10102812	You gonna flirt with all the callers tonight?
10102932	10104553	No, I'm not flirting with the callers.
10104973	10110336	Rob, I compliment people on things that deserve complimenting and he's got a very nice voice, just saying.
10111077	10112137	Not Garrus level.
10113959	10116900	Okay, well thank you for bringing us back down.
10116920	10119082	Well, you're not Garrus, but you're alright.
10119122	10120703	I'm sorry, that's an amazing voice actor.
10120783	10121724	Let's go to another call.
10121784	10122884	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10122904	10123305	Who's this?
10124525	10124845	What's up?
10124886	10125546	It's Travis, guys.
10125586	10126126	How y'all doing?
10126226	10126767	Hey, Travis.
10126787	10127327	How you doing?
10127367	10128628	Now, you're not Travis Donovan.
10129545	10134489	No, I'm Travis that just emailed about Mass Effect and all my other... I like you.
10136430	10140033	I'll tell you what, DarkSakura... That's not flirting!
10140413	10141114	What did you just say?
10141134	10141774	You said, I like you.
10141794	10143395	That game is absolutely phenomenal.
10143435	10150641	You know, I started it probably twice or three times on my Xbox 360, and I never wanted to play it because I just could not get into it.
10150661	10153943	And y'all were just talking about games that you play once and you're just like, I can't do it.
10155144	10159208	and I just played it on my PC and I absolutely love it.
10159469	10160630	Like, unbelievable.
10160950	10161491	Have you gotten it?
10161631	10163813	I got chills right now talking about it.
10163913	10164854	Do you cheat like I do?
10166916	10167257	What's that?
10167337	10168398	Do you cheat like I do?
10170200	10170580	What do you mean?
10170620	10170860	Console.
10170900	10171381	Console.
10172830	10173310	Godmode.
10174071	10175212	I'm playing on the PC right now.
10175432	10177394	I know, so am I. And I am fully cheating.
10177414	10181657	You can do this hacks thing where you can like hack the game for Godmode and all that stuff.
10181697	10184139	Kind of like the, you know, the old school shooters where you could be invincible.
10184700	10185981	IDDQD and all that stuff.
10186861	10188143	No, I'm not doing anything like that.
10188183	10195929	I just played it through and like I said, I was just going with my gut feeling on everything that I said and I was actually a complete asshole in the game and the whole like
10196451	10198733	Oh, what do you want to do with the council at the end?
10198753	10199934	And I'm like, yeah, screw them.
10200034	10200434	Kill them!
10201174	10202455	Yeah, exactly.
10202755	10203696	I'm just after Sovereign.
10206182	10207563	I got two other things about it, though.
10208564	10209744	You guys were just talking about musicals.
10209764	10213366	Has anybody or have any of y'all seen Video Games Live?
10213526	10214087	Because it's coming.
10214147	10214767	I'm in Florida.
10215247	10216608	And it's coming to St.
10216648	10216928	Pete.
10217048	10218649	And I'm so excited to see it.
10219009	10220590	It was a long time ago.
10220730	10229195	Maybe Dark Tetsuya, who is like the OLR historian, will know the episode number.
10229275	10233438	But we actually had Tommy Tallarico on the show for like an Uber interview, like 45 minutes long.
10234198	10235639	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10260020	10284834	other than camp well I need another 45 minutes to get into that but let's just say in our adult lives yes so this is funny anyway sorry no that's really cool because I mean I've been wanting to see it for years and I've got a Spotify account and I listen to like the albums on there and I'm just so stoked that it's coming back to Florida again I can't wait to see it but my other question was
10286004	10292013	Have you guys heard about the game, or it's a mod for Arma 2, it's called DayZ?
10292213	10292574	Yeah.
10293435	10296340	Has anybody gotten into that, or what is it all about?
10296360	10300466	Because I'm a huge Walking Dead fan, and it reminds me so much of Walking Dead, it's ridiculous.
10301245	10329491	I haven't really gotten a chance to play it yet because I'm still trying to figure out how Arma controls to my Xbox 360 controller I've gotten close but it gets complicated but apparently it's very just it drops you down you have you know you have to go find resources and you know there's random groups of people walking around doing weird things like kidnapping people and you know of course you fight zombies but it's more about the crazies that are out there too which are all real people
10330907	10357729	and that's what I've heard and I'm trying to like I guess wrap my head around the point of the game because it seems like the point is just to keep your character alive as long as possible which seems kind of creative pretty much yeah and by the way according to Misty the other OLR historian how dare I how dare I give that crown to only one person because Misty just came in and snatched that crown by saying episode 285 was the Tommy Tallarico interview thank you Misty
10358581	10360843	I'll have to try to look it up then.
10360863	10366387	Yeah, but right now I'm playing through Rage, which everybody has told me to play through, and it's good.
10366527	10369089	I guess it's kind of like a Lanier fallout in a sense.
10369449	10372751	Now's a good time for that with QuakeCon in the air and all that stuff.
10372791	10373852	It was just on Steam this weekend.
10373872	10374473	Yeah, of course.
10374553	10377755	I'm a Steam nut, so I picked it up on Steam for like $10 the other day.
10377775	10378736	So I was like, yeah, why not?
10379016	10389486	Quickly, before I let you go, because I do have to get more calls, but quickly, since you said you're a steam nut, how do you feel about the new end-user license agreement and the waiving your right to a class action lawsuit?
10390527	10391988	You know, I don't mind.
10392208	10398915	Honestly, they've been so good to me over the years, and I've had an account forever, so it's just like I really don't care.
10400031	10400491	Fair enough.
10400511	10401592	Send me a message in chat, by the way.
10401612	10404553	I'm not a too happy type person, so I mean, it's just like, yeah, whatever.
10405033	10405874	It's cool with me.
10406214	10406514	All right.
10406694	10409376	Now, DarkSakura, what's this all about?
10409416	10411056	You want a private message from the caller.
10411076	10412917	Just because I was going to show him my femship.
10413378	10413658	Oh, okay.
10413738	10414018	All right.
10414038	10415959	This is why I like playing on PC.
10416019	10418120	DarkSakura wants to take this conversation offline.
10420841	10421081	All right.
10421101	10421582	Take care, buddy.
10421602	10422142	Thanks for calling.
10422890	10424071	Alright, bye-bye.
10449662	10451445	Freaking Sound Shapes is fantastic.
10451465	10451945	Tell me more!
10451985	10453207	Why is it fantastic?
10454409	10462220	It's a music game that is like a cross between a crappy, boring platformer and LittleBigPlanet.
10463390	10465131	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10487148	10488890	I do like those creation games.
10489410	10490031	Do you know yet?
10490151	10492913	Is it easy to share the stages?
10493013	10495635	Is it easy like LittleBigPlanet?
10496897	10497757	That I'm not sure.
10498098	10498938	I would hope so.
10500700	10503222	Because I want to make a million levels.
10503702	10507326	DJ Morpheus in our chatroom says, It shapes with sounds!
10507686	10508527	Exactly!
10509187	10509928	Exactly!
10509948	10510088	Exactly!
10511961	10523893	It's got a charm to it, though, that makes me feel like I'm playing one of those really retro-style games, kind of like VVVVV or something like that.
10524213	10526616	You're naming all these games I love.
10527196	10529518	You're doing that on purpose to try and get me to be a fan.
10530359	10531640	It's not hard.
10531881	10532601	I've played it...
10533442	10535003	I think it's download only, so good luck with that.
10552926	10557208	or isn't Sound Shapes on the PlayStation 3 too?
10557228	10558368	I think it was also PS3.
10558468	10558768	Oh really?
10558808	10562589	Yeah, you can get a discount apparently if you're a PSN and you pre-order it.
10563770	10564690	A PSN Plus member.
10565230	10566290	I am a PSN Plus member.
10566691	10569351	I know, so am I. Holy shit!
10570252	10575613	I have a $20 PlayStation Network card that I got today so I'm going to pre-order it tonight.
10575633	10577854	How did you get a $20 PlayStation card today?
10578274	10580775	You ended work a couple days ago.
10582806	10584526	Those, I didn't get discounts on those.
10585187	10589447	So, no, I cancelled a pre-order and put that towards Guild Wars and this.
10592348	10593108	I gotcha.
10593388	10601710	So, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm searching Amazon right now to see if it is something that's retail or if it's download only, but it looks like nothing's coming up on Amazon, so.
10601950	10604690	Yeah, Best Buy's website had it and it said it came out May 31st, 2012.
10604790	10606051	I was like, that's not right.
10606071	10606751	That's not right.
10609900	10611221	but I'm excited for it.
10611642	10612983	You need to watch that video though.
10613083	10623512	So now there's going to be Luminous and Sound Shapes and then DJ Max is coming out which had new videos out this week too and it's like I can't handle all the amazing music games on my Vita.
10623672	10624633	It's too good.
10625033	10625874	Alright, fair enough.
10626174	10627155	Anything else before I let you go?
10628381	10632182	More people need to call in about Mass Effect because it's fantastic.
10632462	10634083	All right, we'll try our luck with one more call.
10634743	10635083	All right.
10636024	10642706	Seriously, how much did you smile or laugh when that last guy called in just to talk about how now we've passed it on.
10642766	10644266	We got him hooked on Mass Effect.
10644806	10647447	That needs to happen more often.
10647607	10651748	I didn't listen to the show earlier because I was playing other stuff.
10652329	10652549	But...
10653749	10659933	I saw that I wasn't the only person on your question of the week that said Mass Effect, so I was kind of proud.
10660633	10661354	Alright, take care, buddy.
10661654	10662114	Gotta let you go.
10662815	10663095	Bye.
10663815	10666157	Alright, let's try to get a couple more calls.
10666177	10667197	We're getting slammed tonight.
10667217	10668118	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
10668138	10668498	Who's this?
10670959	10671780	Hey, this is X-Link.
10671800	10672620	Hey, X-Link.
10672640	10673481	How you doing?
10673581	10674401	Hey, doing good.
10674802	10677483	Wicked and Rent for musicals for me.
10677603	10680065	Those were my two favorite to have soundtracks to, so...
10683297	10697848	But no, the reason I was calling it tonight was because I've been playing the last few days and of course some of our other friends have too was the Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance or 3DDDD as I like to shorten it to call it.
10698749	10699749	It's been a really great game.
10699930	10700810	I really enjoyed it.
10700930	10702271	It's been a lot, a lot of fun.
10702431	10704353	It's really short but it's really fun though.
10706354	10712399	It's really taking a lot of the old stuff and tying it back in and making it so when 3 comes out at least it'll
10713004	10715126	Bring the storyline up to Data Part 3.
10720290	10721231	Did you get to Tron World?
10722252	10722732	Yes, I did.
10723232	10723833	How was that?
10724874	10725814	That was a lot of fun.
10726415	10727276	I really enjoyed it.
10727456	10738725	It's very unique in its own way, so I really did enjoy a lot of it and how they're splitting the storyline up between Riku and Sora, so...
10741723	10741843	Mm-hmm
10763317	10766660	Well, it's because of the different ways it branched out.
10766861	10778031	I mean, you had, of course, you had Kingdom Heart 1, you had Kingdom Heart 2, you had the, you had Recoded, you had Chain of Memory, which Chain of Memory was practically between 1 and 2.
10778892	10782135	And then they branched out, like, these little storylines.
10782256	10786600	And then finally, with this one, at least, they're starting to take all the games and saying, okay...
10787355	10805446	Here's the story line between the games in case you didn't see like Burp by Sleep was a prequel to everything and of course so it's pretty much was all over the place but like I said before I like it how they sat down with the game so far and they're pretty much going through and tying everything together going okay this is the reason why this has happened and
10805911	10810415	This is the reason why that one happened the way it did, and this is the reason why this one happened the way it did.
10810455	10816319	So it's kind of, they're taking all the pieces, tying it all together, and getting ready for that big finale at the end, hopefully.
10816499	10818461	Well, I hope to hell it is Kingdom Hearts 3.
10818521	10830290	I got my fingers and toes crossed for Tokyo Game Show announcement, but then again, we still have to get through 13 versus... Well, they did say they are making 3, which is really good, and it's just as to when, who only knows.
10830330	10835554	And like I told you before, I really hope when they do, they take their time, they make sure they end it, you know, they...
10836280	10840543	They tie everything together and they end it in a way so we can go, okay, that was kind of cool.
10840563	10842225	Kind of like with the whole Mass Effect.
10842565	10849470	Is there one of them secret endings that gives you the extra scene that maybe it's too soon to know, but that kind of gives the big kingdom?
10849490	10850151	Yes, there is.
10850231	10850771	I know that.
10850791	10852913	I just don't know what it is exactly yet.
10852953	10854274	But I hear it does tie in.
10854314	10856055	It's supposed to tie into that three.
10856756	10857076	All right.
10857416	10861499	Well, before I let you go, I just got to let you know, Rent, I wasn't such a fan of Rent.
10862520	10862840	Really?
10863040	10863421	Yeah, I know.
10863441	10865042	I know a lot of people are into it, but not me.
10867115	10868175	Some people are, some people aren't.
10868295	10869656	Everybody has their own, you know.
10870516	10870816	All right.
10871436	10873437	I'll get hate mail for that.
10873477	10873777	Don't worry.
10874017	10874217	All right.
10874257	10874737	Take care, buddy.
10874757	10875357	Gotta let you go.
10875957	10876377	All right, man.
10876397	10876677	Thanks.
10876737	10877178	Appreciate it.
10877278	10877818	Bye.
10878638	10881599	One of my friends growing up was turned into a total rent head.
10881799	10884319	And then when I told her later, you know, I saw rent and I wasn't such a fan.
10884339	10885539	She's like, Shun.
10886460	10887000	It's like, what?
10887320	10887820	Opinions.
10888060	10888600	People have them.
10889100	10889360	All right.
10889780	10890541	One more call.
10890601	10891521	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10891541	10891821	Who's this?
10892501	10896504	Hey, hey, hey, from the Brooklyn studios, it's DJ Ranma S. How you doing?
10897125	10898246	I'm doing good, how about you?
10898586	10899427	Disappointed.
10899667	10905892	Sister Act was going to be my reason to come back to New York City, and now it's gone at the end of the month, and there's no way I can afford to get there this month.
10906192	10907213	Well, well, well, stop.
10907654	10911777	Sister Act is your reason to come to New York when there's a bunch of us here that love you?
10913098	10914439	I thought you, I thought it was cool.
10914699	10917221	I thought, I thought, oh, you're wrong.
10917482	10920264	Rama, Rama, Rama, Raven Simone.
10924404	10950618	scene better sorry anyway actually and I will say this too DragonCon was the other thing I was really trying to get to happen but unfortunately it's not going to happen I can't do DragonCon I was hoping with the Southwest sale I could make it work but there's other priorities that's okay PAX East 2013 we got to get the Club VOG suite going
10952116	10953117	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10970575	10972957	I think Gabe Newell is talking out of his ass.
10974539	10976140	And this is the whole Windows 8 thing, right?
10976781	10977161	Yes.
10977682	10978262	Yes, it is.
10978322	10982826	Because I have been running Windows 8 on one of my machines here and at work.
10984788	10990834	All you have to do is turn off the new Metro user interface and you have the desktop back.
10991054	10991514	That's it.
10991754	10992655	You mean to tell me...
10993632	10998054	This portly man couldn't figure out how to push a button to flip it over to that?
10998194	10999054	I mean, really?
10999394	11003716	And he's also complaining about Microsoft is having their own Windows Store.
11003796	11006116	I mean, look, Apple has the App Store.
11007437	11009518	Linux distros have their own different stores.
11010118	11011799	It's open competition.
11011859	11012799	It's fair gaming.
11013059	11015220	I mean, everybody has a choice.
11015440	11016920	He just needs to roll with the punches.
11017160	11019801	So you're saying deal with it, sunglasses falling.
11020602	11021122	Damn right.
11023476	11024037	You're damn right.
11024317	11025818	All right, Ranma, I got to let you go.
11025998	11026979	We got to wrap up the show.
11027440	11028040	It's all good.
11028060	11029221	That's all I need to say.
11029261	11030182	You want to plug your show?
11031443	11032344	Anime Jam Session.
11032384	11037849	This week will be our Otakon 2012 Con Report, and it's going to be quite a good one.
11038434	11038834	Alright.
11040014	11040515	Stay tuned.
11040535	11041335	Tuesday's on VOG.
11041355	11042295	When are you guys going live?
11042315	11044335	Is that still happening?
11044415	11048977	I gotta do some upgrades on my machines and I gotta do a run of tests then we'll go live.
11048997	11055318	I'm hoping by the end of September because there's a lot of stuff I'm working on coming down the pipe and you know.
11055578	11056278	Make it happen.
11056338	11057919	Crack whip.
11057959	11058519	I'm hustling.
11058579	11058899	Alright.
11060059	11060419	Alright.
11060979	11061419	Take care, buddy.
11061800	11062060	You too.
11062080	11062640	Stay fabulous.
11063120	11063360	Always.
11065618	11067139	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
11067179	11079383	Super sorry if you didn't get through, but you can always leave us a voicemail or you can send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or join us in chat, get your thoughts out there or send us a tweet.
11079503	11081204	I'm going to try and read some tweets right now.
11081244	11082164	What do I do with my iPad?
11082584	11087226	While I get my iPad, let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories from Loki.
11090998	11096784	This whole lawsuit between Guitar Hero or I should say Activision and Gwen Stefani is still going on.
11097745	11098685	Oh, what's the latest on that?
11100567	11101808	They still want to sue them.
11102069	11105171	The latest is No Doubt has a new single out.
11105211	11105752	It's not bad.
11107854	11111817	Yeah, so apparently they are, I guess...
11114309	11116470	Yeah, they're still wanting to file a lawsuit.
11118411	11126374	Basically, ideally they would like Activision to apologize and promise to never mistreat artists in the manner that they have been mistreated, no doubt, and countless others.
11132596	11132937	I don't know.
11134177	11138699	It's kind of like I don't care anymore because Guitar Hero, it's not coming out anymore.
11140632	11142032	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11160194	11162176	And I do remember reading about this.
11162616	11165198	The World of Warcraft movie, apparently it's still happening.
11165299	11168361	Sam Raimi's not involved anymore, but there is a new scribe.
11169182	11172725	Charles Leavitt is the new scribe of the World of Warcraft movie.
11173145	11175768	That is the dude who wrote The Seventh Son.
11176768	11177689	What else did he do?
11178250	11180552	Blood Diamond... Wait, hold on.
11180612	11181032	What is this?
11181072	11181613	Wait a minute.
11182353	11183914	Okay, yeah, he did do the latest script.
11184474	11187315	Okay, so The Seventh Son is the latest movie that's coming out.
11187355	11188576	Sorry, I read these live.
11188736	11191057	I haven't read this article in advance before it was tweeted to me.
11193158	11197740	Warner Brothers is putting out that Seventh Son pick on October 18, 2013.
11197921	11201802	Other movies he's written, Blood Diamond, The Mighty, and K-Pax.
11202283	11205084	I haven't seen any of those movies, but Blood Diamond was Oscar nominated, right?
11205104	11207745	I think it was Oscar nominated for performance, not for script.
11207785	11209066	Wasn't K-Pax the one with Kevin Spacey?
11209881	11211542	Yeah, I did see that one.
11212182	11212522	How was it?
11212862	11213382	Was it well written?
11213622	11214142	It was alright.
11214202	11215163	Yeah, I think it was well written.
11216023	11217543	So we don't know any details outside of that.
11217824	11221625	However, they do say Legendary also has the Mass Effect film in development.
11221785	11222645	That is still a thing.
11223105	11224586	And that has been kind of reaffirmed.
11224646	11224906	What?
11225106	11225906	The Mass Effect film.
11226206	11226626	No way!
11226786	11227787	Yeah, they're doing a Mass Effect film.
11228067	11229587	I was just talking about this earlier.
11229727	11234669	It's supposed to be based off the first game, but I'm... It needs to be Chick Shepard.
11236371	11260541	you know what everybody's saying it's going to be Dude Shepard and I don't know if they made that announcement officially but I play a Dude Shepard in Mass Effect but for real I actually totally agree with you I think the only way they're going to make the fans all of them happy is to do Fem Shep in the movie and I think it would be totally acceptable but at that point it's all about the casting if they don't cast the right person as Fem Shep and I don't know who it could be
11261892	11263114	Kim Kardashian No, no, and more no
11275919	11280141	All right, I got to pull this one up on the computer because Tigerclaw sent us another link, but it's to a video.
11280481	11282002	And it did kind of crack me up.
11282042	11283142	I actually saw this earlier.
11283182	11285403	I think he or somebody else posted it on Facebook.
11287124	11294307	And it's a guy getting a question wrong on who wants to be a millionaire that you think everybody would know.
11294687	11295027	Here it is.
11295347	11296788	Now, apologies.
11297108	11299189	This is somebody shooting at their TV.
11299589	11300669	So he's going for the $7,000 question.
11306021	11307482	So everybody here knows that one, right?
11307522	11308603	It's the Konami code.
11308663	11310625	It's the Capcom code?
11310645	11312026	Well, that's one of the answers.
11312146	11314828	Well, let me see if she reads them here.
11329212	11339037	Bandai Code, Capcom Code, Konami Code Seriously, if you're going to do a YouTube shooting at your television, stop doing the dishes in the background.
11339077	11339657	It gets in the way.
11339677	11342539	Did they literally do A, B, C?
11343219	11351923	And you can't figure out which... A was Atari Code, B was Bandai Code, C was Capcom Code, D was Konami Code.
11352063	11353764	Gee, which one stands out?
11353824	11354985	Derp Derp Code, well...
11362812	11368516	so he used his lifeline called jump the question which essentially allows him to skip it
11370370	11370790	There it was.
11370850	11371871	But hey, Konami Code on TV.
11371891	11373833	They have the Jump the Question lifeline now.
11373933	11375734	Man, I haven't watched that in a long time.
11377195	11378876	Like, they got rid of the hot seat.
11379116	11379957	It's standing now.
11379977	11381298	The game's all played standing.
11381638	11382559	Like, who wants to be a millionaire?
11382579	11383459	It's like a totally different show.
11383479	11384540	But Meredith Vieira's still there.
11385481	11386802	That's the only thing she hosts now.
11387362	11388523	So, anyway.
11391184	11418374	one more tweet from Osfer sent us a tweet hi guys I'd listen live but I'm going on Space Mountain instead he's at Disney World right now you butt so Osfer you know you're a great guy I like you but fuck you love OLR that's gonna do it for tweets that's gonna do it for phone calls that does it for last minute stories
11419312	11421554	Yes, and that does it for the show.
11422275	11425938	But not before we get around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11426318	11435666	Before I do that, I do want to say one more time, thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and spending your Sunday evening with us or your work day or whenever you're listening to this podcast, your commute or what have you.

11479346	11479546	All right.
11479566	11480766	You have any final thoughts for our listeners?
11482147	11482407	No.
11482767	11483607	Anything you want to plug?
11484528	11484908	Not really.
11485228	11485548	All right.
11486509	11489510	Well, you think about that, and next time you come back with something to plug...
11490990	11513725	and have a good road trip whatever you go on next time all right um Loki we'll go to you next your final thought tonight I really don't like Jason Steele what he's done with the film cow channel I mean just do another Charlie the Unicorn not stop trying to like kick start these new like series like hit it with a car or you know the horseman or something it's just not funny
11516056	11519579	My final thought tonight is I smell dinner and it smells good.
11519640	11520320	Thank you, Alan.
11521522	11521662	Yay.
11522623	11523163	I got a yay.
11523744	11528009	And naming your WoW characters after Mass Effect characters, it's the hip thing to do.
11528029	11532373	That means that I need to make Shakarian.
11533094	11535697	All right, and DarkSakura, is that your final thought or do you have another one for us?
11536157	11536558	Garrus.
11537058	11537339	All right.
11537935	11540497	Thank you guys once again for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
11540517	11542258	We will be back next week to do it all again.
11542558	11544359	I hear we have a special guest again next week.
11544399	11546281	I think I can say Jason's gonna be back next week.
11546341	11548422	He hasn't been here in a couple months so we're gonna have him back.
11548782	11549483	Looking forward to it.
11549823	11550504	More news.
11550944	11553486	Really curious to see what develops on Twitter with Loki.
11554726	11555667	and Ernest Cline.
11556048	11557909	I'm very excited to see what becomes of that.
11558250	11560311	Maybe this whole nightmare will be over in a week's time.
11560371	11561472	Somebody will break that score.
11561573	11567478	All they have to do is just drop that game off the list of eligible games and we'll be all good.
11567498	11572042	It'll be just ridiculously hard challenge instead of ridiculously unfair hard challenge.
11572321	11578503	Alright, if you're listening live at the VOG Network, please stay tuned for the Mars Curiosity Landing Special.

11585905	11586765	You said science fiction.
11586805	11587845	Science non-fiction.
