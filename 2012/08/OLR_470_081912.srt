1
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:12,310
[SPEAKER_04]: and Loki.

2
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:24,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, August 19, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again.

3
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:37,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:37,406 --> 00:00:49,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com for this August 19th, 2012 with the 470th episode of our program.

5
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:50,672
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:56,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything going on in the world of gaming and then some with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:56,994 --> 00:00:59,535
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:00,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

9
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:00,816
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you, ma'am?

10
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sore.

11
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:03,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Sore?

12
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:04,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

13
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:06,799
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been doing that's made you sore?

14
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, what kind of girl do you think I am?

15
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:10,982
[SPEAKER_03]: A DDR playing girl?

16
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:11,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, actually.

17
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:12,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

18
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:14,224
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll touch on that in a minute.

19
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:14,964
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fair enough.

20
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:17,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

22
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:18,226
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:18,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Doing good.

24
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:19,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

25
00:01:19,507 --> 00:01:26,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So what food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in for food every week, what won this week?

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,921
[SPEAKER_11]: The Double Western at Carl's Jr.

27
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:29,362
[SPEAKER_11]: or Hardee's on the East Coast.

28
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:30,824
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

29
00:01:31,404 --> 00:01:31,724
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

30
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:39,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

31
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat room throughout the night.

32
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:44,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So be sure to get in there so you can participate with us.

33
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:46,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the three of us in studio.

34
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:48,676
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first show in a little while, it seems like, with no guests.

35
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little lonely.

36
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,437
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight.

37
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how we're going to top last week's episode.

38
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:54,598
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a pretty good episode.

39
00:01:54,878 --> 00:01:56,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll try, though.

40
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,340
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring our best C game tonight.

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,121
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what?

42
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,664
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have some awesome things tonight that are... We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know.

43
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:08,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the webcam's in the other... No, you took the webcam, didn't you?

44
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:09,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I did take it.

45
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:10,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works.

46
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:13,909
[SPEAKER_03]: You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight.

47
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:17,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell Millie doesn't have a webcam built into it.

48
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, it does!

49
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:20,773
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, I do have my iPad.

50
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

51
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Ustream app on the iPad.

52
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:27,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop.

53
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:30,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I deleted all the Windows shit and have the Linux shit.

54
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:31,941
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

55
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,863
[SPEAKER_03]: In all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight.

56
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:39,987
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool.

57
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,248
[SPEAKER_03]: From the Darksiders 2 soundtrack.

58
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners.

59
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:48,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Something Music, S-U-M thing.

60
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,074
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk more about that later on.

61
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:54,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's all sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com.

62
00:02:55,638 --> 00:03:03,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m.

63
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:11,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our pal Bobby Blackwolf with his show, The Bobby Blackwolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, every Sunday.

64
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well.

65
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:19,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth.

66
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:20,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They do some movies as well.

67
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:23,919
[SPEAKER_03]: British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist.

68
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:26,500
[SPEAKER_03]: PodCulture is awesome.

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And PodCulture's got something special tomorrow.

70
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,702
[SPEAKER_03]: They're back with an all-new episode.

71
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:30,823
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been off for a couple weeks.

72
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:35,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books.

73
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:41,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview.

74
00:03:41,649 --> 00:03:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually doing a giveaway.

75
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Oop.

76
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure to tune in and check that out at PodCulture.

77
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:48,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of other great shows too.

78
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Horde House.

79
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:51,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Horde House is okay.

80
00:03:53,713 --> 00:03:55,833
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of the shows are great.

81
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

82
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:01,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but we usually have a kickoff topic.

83
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:05,395
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit recurring.

84
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:05,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Crack!

85
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:09,836
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the first time we talked about crack on the show?

86
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do drugs, kids.

87
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs are bad.

88
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:18,560
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter and kind of like talking about that site.

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter.

90
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:24,843
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter.

91
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:28,185
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter.

92
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:31,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters.

93
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that many.

94
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,188
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?

95
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:34,989
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?

96
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:35,909
[SPEAKER_03]: How many is not that many?

97
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:37,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at least five, right?

98
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:40,450
[SPEAKER_11]: See?

99
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:41,851
[SPEAKER_11]: See?

100
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:42,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven, I'm sorry.

101
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,193
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, here's the point.

102
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:47,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I donated to a Kickstarter this week.

103
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:49,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually finally joined the website.

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I signed up for Kickstarter.

105
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:54,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It was to expand the Mantis website.

106
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:54,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

107
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:55,665
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

108
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Heck no.

109
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, make that nine.

110
00:04:58,748 --> 00:04:59,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

111
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Nine Kickstarters?

112
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly this week... You know, you can just take that money and give it to me and I'll put it to better use.

113
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,794
[SPEAKER_03]: This week from maybe five to nine?

114
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:09,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's some I forgot.

115
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:11,957
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about those playing cards.

116
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:14,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are awesome.

117
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:15,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan was like, wow, that's cool.

118
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot about the Megaran thing, which I'm still waiting on.

119
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,642
[SPEAKER_11]: There's apparently the comic coming too.

120
00:05:20,802 --> 00:05:23,824
[SPEAKER_11]: And then Shadowrun Returns.

121
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:25,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Shadowrun Returns would be awesome.

122
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Can't wait for that.

123
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:31,391
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week.

124
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter.

125
00:05:38,457 --> 00:05:39,858
[SPEAKER_03]: $180 to this Kickstarter.

126
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Cue dramatic chipmunk.

127
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:43,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Or prairie dog.

128
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:43,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

129
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:51,019
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood.

130
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:55,040
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave $180 to the GamerCon Kickstarter.

131
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,721
[SPEAKER_03]: The G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter.

132
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:00,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

133
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:08,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can totally see where being a startup event, they really need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big.

134
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:10,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been great promotion for them.

135
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,847
[SPEAKER_03]: And as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support.

136
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,328
[SPEAKER_03]: So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going and

137
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:18,709
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind going.

138
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,871
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big.

139
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:23,492
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do anything half-assed.

140
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:26,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I. It sent me back $180.

141
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there you go.

142
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I donated to a Kickstarter.

143
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,271
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

144
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:07,494
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that... If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool.

145
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

146
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet there is a boob con.

147
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look for it.

148
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:10,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

149
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:16,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, boob con is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some boob con at GamerCon.

150
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget the lesbians.

151
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,400
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a boob con.

152
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's... Oh, it's a Facebook utility.

153
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,423
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole thing is that...

154
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:33,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of having this event and to bring gay gamers together because I've met a lot of really cool people.

155
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:39,196
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends to this day.

156
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:44,638
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on Game Boy, we met at one of those gay gamer parties.

157
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:49,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming.

158
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,701
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'm sure Dark Sakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them.

159
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,522
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as she has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right?

160
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:58,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd go.

161
00:07:58,383 --> 00:07:58,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

162
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:02,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets.

163
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:05,431
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies and you're not going to be shunned.

164
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,813
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just wear a shirt that says hag.

165
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:15,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the other thing is that, you know, obviously...

166
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:31,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how far I want to go with this like this controversial topic or whatever but in the gaming culture you know a lot of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live and you know

167
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Fag, fag, fag.

168
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:34,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like we're alone.

169
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,716
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of racist stuff that happens.

170
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:40,342
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of really bad things that happen on Xbox Live.

171
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:41,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think I only play with you guys?

172
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:46,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh, so-and-so's a fag.

173
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:55,263
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because the people that play on Xbox Live and actually just a lot of people that play games nowadays online are very unintelligent and young.

174
00:08:55,723 --> 00:09:03,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that for a fact from the modding community that I talk to these people directly and it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stupid?

175
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:11,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense that doesn't have any sort of complete misspellings of everything?

176
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:12,243
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

177
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:38,951
[SPEAKER_03]: In the gay culture, even, people are like, oh, you play video games all day?

178
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean you don't like to... Accessorize?

179
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:50,767
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artist, or you don't read such and such blogs, or a lot of those types of things.

180
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:52,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

181
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:57,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true.

182
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I have faced some of that in the gay culture.

183
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:17,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's tough sometimes because you don't feel like you fit in column A. You don't feel like you fit in column B. So I think it's really awesome that there's a lot of people raising their voice thanks to the internet that feel like they kind of don't fit in these columns and having a convention to just celebrate

184
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:18,512
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here.

185
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:27,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the con exists to make a statement or the con exists to further the cause or whatever.

186
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the con exists to have fun.

187
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I plan to do.

188
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:35,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a gay old time and gay isn't happy.

189
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have a gay old time.

190
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:38,501
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a good time.

191
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:40,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean...

192
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,600
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other equivalent is YaoiCon, really.

193
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:45,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And YaoiCon exists.

194
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:46,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's more for girls.

195
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:57,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I think GamerCon is just for anybody that just wants to have fun in a supportive environment.

196
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides that, you were talking about Columns.

197
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:00,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Columns.

198
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:01,150
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was shit.

199
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:02,859
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

200
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:13,634
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know, when anyone says, well, I have this or I am this.

201
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, you look like you're a human being to me.

202
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:17,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Actlikeit

203
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you, just letter you, get it to work?

204
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that makes sense.

205
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:39,341
[SPEAKER_11]: How about this one?

206
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we take thing away?

207
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:48,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just let me know because trying to get it by today.

208
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that is fine.

209
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,665
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you think it is?

210
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:59,867
[SPEAKER_11]: And just let me know when you get it to work.

211
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my fucking god.

212
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:02,950
[SPEAKER_11]: How is Babi formed?

213
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, seriously.

214
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:05,712
[SPEAKER_11]: It...

215
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go to some comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com where we have plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight.

216
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:18,347
[SPEAKER_03]: JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway?

217
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:19,829
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't picked a venue yet.

218
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:21,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in San Francisco.

219
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,352
[SPEAKER_03]: They've said that much, but we don't know what venue.

220
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:24,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that could be a lot of different places.

221
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,094
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be a hotel.

222
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:26,875
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it at the Hilton.

223
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,097
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do it at the Moscone Center if they get enough money.

224
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where they're going to have it yet.

225
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:35,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So more to come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere.

226
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,543
[SPEAKER_03]: ACIDICVAMPIRE in chat says...

227
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragenator says sadly enough when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone the other person immediately pictures a fat balding middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in their mom's basement and never goes outside

228
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:10,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record.

229
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:17,821
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I mean, exactly the point is that, you know, there's kind of these, like, stereotypes, and it's throughout all of our cultures.

230
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos?

231
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:22,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Is they have those giant Cheetos.

232
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:29,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, really, the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio is just fucked up by that.

233
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:30,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

234
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,011
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, any chance that you would go to GamerCon?

235
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now.

236
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:41,955
[SPEAKER_11]: But what if you told the wife it was a gay gamer convention?

237
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,475
[SPEAKER_03]: She'd laugh.

238
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:43,275
[SPEAKER_03]: She would get a kick out of that.

239
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because... We should try to get a panel.

240
00:13:47,157 --> 00:13:47,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love that.

241
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Would she let you go if we had a panel?

242
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps, yeah.

243
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:51,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

244
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally get us a panel.

245
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,140
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do.

246
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

247
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And free tickets.

248
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,228
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

249
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:03,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how was your gaming week?

250
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,073
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you hinted at this a minute ago.

251
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:05,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I played The Ditter.

252
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:08,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is what happened.

253
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:11,379
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Dance Dance Revolution for the uninformed.

254
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:11,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

255
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:20,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but it was an amicable breakup.

256
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:20,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Amicable breakup.

257
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:27,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Golfland on some corporate picnic day.

258
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:32,788
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay.

259
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:37,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag, which I didn't do either.

260
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And get in the water park, which I didn't do either.

261
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:41,792
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

262
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:45,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We just went in and had a good time.

263
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: But while we were waiting for lunch to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR.

264
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:51,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we also got 20 credits on one of those little cards.

265
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there were already three credits in the DDR.

266
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, I'll play them all.

267
00:14:58,296 --> 00:14:59,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on four songs.

268
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:04,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar.

269
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:06,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, damn it, I'm not old.

270
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I can still do it.

271
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I did fail Cowgirl, which is very sad.

272
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:11,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that used to be one of my best ones.

273
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:12,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Bang, ba-doo, bang.

274
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:12,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

275
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:31,174
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've made it through that and by the time I got done I felt like I needed to throw up because I was hot and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while and that's the point where you realized I was in my DDR prime 10 years ago when I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now which is sad

276
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:39,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, I went and had a good time at lunch and I felt better once I ate something and had a good time.

277
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,904
[SPEAKER_06]: And my BFF forever, Specky, was there with the boy and her hubby.

278
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:45,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, they're listening.

279
00:15:46,326 --> 00:15:46,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ro.

280
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:47,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ro.

281
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had a really good time and Dan and I played copious amounts of Tank Tank Tank.

282
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:56,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's this other game too that I... Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U?

283
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:57,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it coming out?

284
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:02,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Tank Tank Tank is going to be one of the launch games for Wii U. I don't know if we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will.

285
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:05,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game.

286
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:08,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island.

287
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:10,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost on the Island of Tropics.

288
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a shooter game where you're on a...

289
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:16,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

290
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:49,041
[SPEAKER_06]: it's great and then like when you finish each like the last like the boss of the first level is this huge mungus squid and you also have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes it's pretty cute but um

291
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:56,457
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds all sorts of like... How was that game called?

292
00:16:57,118 --> 00:16:58,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, they totally interrupted that.

293
00:16:58,719 --> 00:16:59,901
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of their gun shooting games.

294
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:00,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really awesome.

295
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:02,764
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that it was on the Wii and also in the arcade.

296
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Freaking Sega, of course.

297
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it... What was I saying?

298
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

299
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter.

300
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:13,955
[SPEAKER_06]: to see how compatible you are.

301
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,315
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan and I were 60%.

302
00:17:17,456 --> 00:17:24,679
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also funny when you shoot the same things, it gives you this like twin bonus and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of it.

303
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,622
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I died at the second stage and so Dan continued and he made it a little bit further.

304
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:37,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's like when you get like less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next to him on the bus.

305
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wow, that's kind of cold.

306
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:45,149
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I played more DDR and Dan played with me and he's like, I forgot how to play.

307
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I never ever saw Dan play DDR.

308
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me.

309
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:48,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.

310
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:52,692
[SPEAKER_06]: He like, you know, he could, like the hardest he could do was like Dynamite Rave.

311
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR.

312
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:56,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

313
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:57,559
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

314
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:44,703
[SPEAKER_06]: so I was like I'm out of practice so we actually discussed this we're gonna hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again because I've got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks and like one of them didn't work the other two did so we're gonna start playing DDR again at home good luck thanks it's all part of the plan

315
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:46,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I also played more games.

316
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:26,789
[SPEAKER_06]: more more games alrighty because I'm still playing through Mass Effect Mass Effect 2 for Becky with a Para FemShep and Garrus totally Garrus I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3 which I'm still at the same part that I am and every time I load it up I just get depressed and turn it back off and I want to play more multiplayer next week does it involve Morden?

317
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,892
[SPEAKER_06]: no oh okay no I'm I already passed that I'm not Thessia oh okay oh yeah that part

318
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:35,513
[SPEAKER_06]: But this time I'm taking Javik with me and not Garrus.

319
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed.

320
00:19:39,896 --> 00:19:40,777
[SPEAKER_03]: How considerate of you.

321
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:44,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures.

322
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:49,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have my fourth 85 in WoW.

323
00:19:50,183 --> 00:19:50,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Addict.

324
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:52,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Dealer, how many do you have?

325
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:54,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my fifth this week.

326
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:57,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my four in last time.

327
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:58,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I now have two Druids at 85.

328
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Leviathan is coming, the DLC for Mass Effect I know!

329
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's excited I am!

330
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:28,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to check it out.

331
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does this all have to hit the same day?

332
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:35,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Leviathan, Guild Wars 2, and the big WoW patch all hit the same day.

333
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,999
[SPEAKER_03]: How much is Leviathan going to be?

334
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:37,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably $10.

335
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Vita patch is that day too.

336
00:20:41,402 --> 00:20:42,283
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a story on it later.

337
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:42,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

338
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:44,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not playing Guild Wars.

339
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:48,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to check it out, but at least there's no monthly fee.

340
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Guild Wars is one of those things I can kind of look at any time.

341
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I mean, I've still got a... I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get the WoW thing right away.

342
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:03,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Except if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy it, you know, as a treat to myself.

343
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, while I've still got other tunes to work on, like, what's the point?

344
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

345
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:10,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

346
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:18,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing I'm excited about for WoW is that... I know this isn't Horde House, but I'm excited that all of the races are going to be available soon.

347
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:21,233
[SPEAKER_06]: from the get-go for everybody.

348
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:26,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's not in our news roll tonight because I was going to save that for Horde House, which is fine.

349
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:35,078
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the big news about anybody can play any race except don't expect to play a panda next Tuesday.

350
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:37,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Pandas will unlock with Pandaria.

351
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,561
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a panda.

352
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But you will need to go past level 85.

353
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,705
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says...

354
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that trailer was released this week out of Gamescom, the new World of Warcraft trailer.

355
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:11,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked great.

356
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:13,963
[SPEAKER_03]: The CGI was beautiful.

357
00:22:14,203 --> 00:22:19,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, with all this talk about a World of Warcraft movie and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes.

358
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be great.

359
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I have to say, overall...

360
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:24,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little disappointed in the trailer.

361
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:31,234
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer would show a little bit of everything.

362
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:37,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these new five mans.

363
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,520
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really show any of that.

364
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to see a rendered version of the Temple of the Jade Serpent and some of that gorgeous stuff.

365
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:51,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been looking at data dumps for some of the internal stuff.

366
00:22:52,028 --> 00:22:57,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically people just doing run-throughs of the empty temples and the empty dungeons and everything, so this looks pretty neat.

367
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up.

368
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,271
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll move on to Loki.

369
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:29,124
[SPEAKER_06]: well I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends and I'm about ready to delete it yeah I'm getting that with song pop I'm kind of over song pop now like it was fun for two weeks but now now I've moved on to another game and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any of it but I still like draw something and the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking at any ads so I'm all cool I've drawn some perverted shit in that game

370
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:31,931
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki.

371
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:34,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

372
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:43,838
[SPEAKER_11]: I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, a little bit of that, and Minecraft, a whole lot of Minecraft.

373
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:45,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Getting bored with it again.

374
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:52,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with, and that's really odd considering there's so many people that bought the game.

375
00:23:53,844 --> 00:23:58,728
[SPEAKER_11]: None of my friends seem to be playing games that we can join in or whatever.

376
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:03,432
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like... The map that we're on, we've kind of explored everything.

377
00:24:03,452 --> 00:24:05,554
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it.

378
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:09,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can dupe stuff.

379
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:11,259
[SPEAKER_11]: So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole.

380
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was like, wow, create a crater.

381
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:15,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Bored still.

382
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:16,384
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like...

383
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:18,729
[SPEAKER_06]: May I interject one thing?

384
00:24:18,949 --> 00:24:21,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft What?

385
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:27,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives and everything that says I love and when it exploded it said but

386
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,450
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so mature, I love it.

387
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:46,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that that might be, because you know, DarkSakura, if you've been listening to previous episodes, she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that I Love Butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to DarkSakura getting on the Minecraft tour.

388
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:46,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Cracked the door open.

389
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It cracked the door open.

390
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:53,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like on my ass.

391
00:24:55,485 --> 00:25:00,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And that and seeing people making giant pigs and like Goombas and Mario and shit, that was pretty funny.

392
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:05,968
[SPEAKER_11]: you do realize I have a giant pig in my map I was talking about your giant pig

393
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:11,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, moving on.

394
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:17,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I did happen to see, for example, something that was more structured to be kind of fun with other people.

395
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:21,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched one of those Wii Play things.

396
00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:25,770
[SPEAKER_11]: It was with the Machinima, I think they do that.

397
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a bunch of people playing a survival type game where...

398
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

399
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:52,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was really hilarious.

400
00:25:52,728 --> 00:25:54,549
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like the Minecraft Hunger Games.

401
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:55,909
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have that.

402
00:25:55,949 --> 00:25:56,729
[SPEAKER_11]: They have that too.

403
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,270
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is like, it was sort of like that.

404
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,630
[SPEAKER_11]: But that looked like fun.

405
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,231
[SPEAKER_11]: See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people.

406
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:05,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds like a lot of fun with Minecraft.

407
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:11,293
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, when we first started playing, it was like you, me and Bobby, and then like other people joining in.

408
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:13,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

409
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:38,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironically, though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap and it was featured in an article I read.

410
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:45,474
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Castle Builder Z. Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games.

411
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:53,636
[SPEAKER_11]: It is only $1, 80 Microsoft points, so worth checking out for that kind of amount of money.

412
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:59,058
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics.

413
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:05,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, even crappier than... I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its graphical finesse.

414
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,481
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like they made their own textures.

415
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:11,022
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft.

416
00:27:12,062 --> 00:27:15,664
[SPEAKER_11]: But you have guns, and you can craft weapons and stuff like that.

417
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,725
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's zombies.

418
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft?

419
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:22,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

420
00:27:22,246 --> 00:27:22,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

421
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:24,715
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's zombies.

422
00:27:24,795 --> 00:27:30,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies that are in the regular Minecraft.

423
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:35,562
[SPEAKER_11]: These are like, I'm going to run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill you zombies.

424
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,764
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well.

425
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:41,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much the whole game is like...

426
00:27:42,666 --> 00:27:45,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Very, very... It's not... I don't know.

427
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:46,809
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of scary.

428
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:54,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the ambience, the sound that they have in there kind of sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds.

429
00:27:55,275 --> 00:27:56,116
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's pretty much it.

430
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:56,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like...

431
00:27:58,337 --> 00:28:09,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the first time out, I was like, okay, crap, this looks like night all the time.

432
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, when it's daytime, it's gloomy and lightning outside.

433
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,721
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it's nighttime, it's dark, but there's tons of shit running at you.

434
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:22,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood.

435
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:23,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Crap.

436
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,143
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm waiting in there.

437
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:30,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some wood.

438
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:31,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Go punch a tree.

439
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:32,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Only in Minecraft.

440
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:37,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did that, and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies.

441
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:38,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know what they were.

442
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:44,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Just something that was snarling and sounding like a tiger or something, but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me.

443
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:51,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So I started firing a pistol at it, and that didn't really do anything because I got rushed from a few other sides at the same time.

444
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:52,616
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

445
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:33,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you can't sleep or anything and then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties they can dig through the tunnel and get to you.

446
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

447
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:53,994
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.

448
00:29:54,014 --> 00:29:57,155
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on.

449
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Just try it.

450
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:01,756
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to try it, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun.

451
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:04,777
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it.

452
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And in general, don't forget about indie games.

453
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget about Xbox Indie Game.

454
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,362
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of fun stuff on there.

455
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:10,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not bad.

456
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:12,925
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series.

457
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:21,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It was one of, like, two or three series that were on Indie Games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft came out.

458
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:23,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And they still do, and they still sell all right, but...

459
00:30:25,161 --> 00:30:39,773
[SPEAKER_11]: They're fun in their own right, and it's four-player co-op, and you can play online and stuff like that, so it's worth it for like... I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting in your account that's just... Yeah, leftover from Rock Band purchases or something.

460
00:30:39,793 --> 00:30:41,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, or something like that, so definitely worth checking out.

461
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:45,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that are worth checking out, but it was kind of fun.

462
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,540
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick.

463
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:50,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of new stuff this week.

464
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:54,801
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the stuff from last week, like Sound Shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth.

465
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:56,362
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did play two new games.

466
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,263
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them's a little herpy derpy.

467
00:30:58,303 --> 00:30:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk about this real quick.

468
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:00,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an iOS game.

469
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:02,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing it mostly on my iPad.

470
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:08,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle, but it's not.

471
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually nothing like that.

472
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play.

473
00:31:12,212 --> 00:31:13,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 99 cents.

474
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:18,116
[SPEAKER_03]: But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins and stuff.

475
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:19,137
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really have to do it.

476
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:48,124
[SPEAKER_03]: um the crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match game where you like they call it match three in the description but it's not bejeweled at all it's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like that over and over and

477
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:52,866
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's addicting.

478
00:31:52,926 --> 00:31:53,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute.

479
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:56,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have this little town of villagers, and some of them wear chicken outfits.

480
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:57,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cute.

481
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:58,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever.

482
00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,870
[SPEAKER_03]: There's that.

483
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came out today, is New Super Mario Bros.

484
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,154
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 on the 3DS.

485
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:09,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I did pick that up today.

486
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:12,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it.

487
00:32:12,256 --> 00:32:13,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't give it a full review yet.

488
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:16,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post something more in depth on VOGnetwork.com later this week.

489
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:17,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Plug, plug.

490
00:32:17,523 --> 00:32:20,087
[SPEAKER_11]: But how similar is its new Super Mario Brothers?

491
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:25,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing?

492
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:26,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

493
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:34,740
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but at the same time, it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of effort into it, if it's pretty similar.

494
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, there are some new stuff.

495
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:38,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially with this one.

496
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:44,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of think the whole, like, Mario's after coins, I think it's a little bit corny.

497
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:45,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the power-ups are neat.

498
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I love the one that turns you into giant.

499
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I guess that was in the previous games, too.

500
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:50,514
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was like, ooh, giant Mario.

501
00:32:51,594 --> 00:33:09,084
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins it was kind of neat and it really where the game shines as it usually does is level design I've played a lot of really well designed levels

502
00:33:10,899 --> 00:33:12,500
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

503
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:59,150
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever which is kind of like I guess like the secret world and the stages get a little harder but like one of them was like really neat design because the way the blocks were you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks to get all the coins it's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual but just like the way the blocks were it looked like one solid block but it's got all these lines in it so you had to I don't know

504
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,712
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay.

505
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:06,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D.

506
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:10,839
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which did it very well.

507
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,761
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I liked it so far.

508
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:34,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins as possible and then you street pass to somebody else and you get their record so you can try to play the same three stages they did even though it was randomized.

509
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:41,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element which wasn't in any other Mario game so far.

510
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something new.

511
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:43,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it that.

512
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:44,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a little different.

513
00:34:45,326 --> 00:34:47,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I will get into this in the show a little later.

514
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:51,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially.

515
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:56,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious about that because, again, level design is where these games tend to shine.

516
00:34:57,935 --> 00:35:02,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times.

517
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:05,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I'll be honest in that regard.

518
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:13,185
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in a long time where I go, this really isn't original.

519
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

520
00:35:14,326 --> 00:35:39,772
[SPEAKER_03]: which I know is weird because Mario games are essentially all the same mechanic but think about it you know in the original Super Mario Bros and then there's Mario Bros 2 it's like holy shit this is totally different and then Mario Bros 3 kind of went back more towards the first one but you know if it ain't fixed don't break it Mario World was like completely Yoshi and all this then Mario 64 oh my god 3D Mario Galaxy oh my god the planets and everything is just different this is the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like

521
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:40,923
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

522
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Just straight up bad.

523
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:05,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even think Mario Sunshine, you could say, was a bad game.

524
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:08,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think Mario Sunshine was great.

525
00:36:08,868 --> 00:36:09,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Mario Sunshine.

526
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula.

527
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:14,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Go with it.

528
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:16,763
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

529
00:36:17,944 --> 00:36:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I should go to the chat room.

530
00:36:19,604 --> 00:36:22,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Live.VogNetwork.com Let's see.

531
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:26,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Shayna Link goes in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30k coins so far.

532
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:27,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives me incentive to keep playing.

533
00:36:28,268 --> 00:36:32,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get something special.

534
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

535
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,971
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably just all the levels backwards or something.

536
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:39,132
[SPEAKER_03]: WhatUpG says the Raccoon power-up is back.

537
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:39,812
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

538
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:46,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last... No, the Mario 3D Land of the Doogie.

539
00:36:46,713 --> 00:36:50,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just straight-up Raccoon Mario just like you remember it in Mario 3.

540
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:54,575
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario 3.

541
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:57,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you go to World 2.

542
00:36:57,775 --> 00:36:58,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a desert world.

543
00:36:58,936 --> 00:36:59,596
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shock.

544
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a lot of the same formula.

545
00:37:02,677 --> 00:37:04,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it is the third new Super Mario Bros.

546
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:07,240
[SPEAKER_11]: game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Bros.

547
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's not that new.

548
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: They should just call it Well-Polished Mario Bros.

549
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:12,743
2.

550
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that a little something?

551
00:37:14,464 --> 00:37:20,788
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, really, you couldn't have come up with a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Bros.

552
00:37:20,848 --> 00:37:21,088
[SPEAKER_11]: game.

553
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya.

554
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:31,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, Mario 2's original version, meaning the Japanese version, Lost Levels here, right, wasn't too different from Super Mario Bros.

555
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:31,751
1.

556
00:37:32,432 --> 00:37:36,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty.

557
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,673
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great comparison.

558
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:42,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Lost Levels or Mario 2 in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario 1.

559
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping.

560
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:50,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and Mario 2 that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally.

561
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:52,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but I'm not talking about that.

562
00:37:52,398 --> 00:37:53,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about that whole thing.

563
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,523
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, where they say, oh, how innovative, how different, it wasn't even a Mario game.

564
00:37:58,904 --> 00:37:59,444
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

565
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:02,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, go back to the Lost Levels or Japanese 2 and 1.

566
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:06,090
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very... I mean, I don't think Lost Levels is a bad game.

567
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really... It's a challenging-ass Mario game.

568
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,092
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an asshole game.

569
00:38:09,312 --> 00:38:09,672
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

570
00:38:10,533 --> 00:38:14,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those special worlds.

571
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:14,496
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

572
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:20,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Tigerclaw says the next version would be New New Super Mario Bros.

573
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:24,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Very new.

574
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:26,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Bros.

575
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:26,188
2015.

576
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:32,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it could be a band-themed one because new Super Mario Bros.

577
00:38:33,192 --> 00:38:33,272
[SPEAKER_11]: U2.

578
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:36,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, WhatUpG reminds us Mario 2 had the poison mushrooms.

579
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:37,715
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a little different too.

580
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:41,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but here's the one tiny concern I have.

581
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:47,661
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not that original.

582
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,662
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is.

583
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:50,383
Hmm.

584
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:54,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's going to happen when that Wii U Mario game comes out?

585
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:58,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these games are not coming out with a lot of time apart between them.

586
00:38:58,527 --> 00:39:00,888
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table?

587
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:03,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again?

588
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:12,413
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing, but now with the gimmick that, hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii.

589
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:14,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait, no one wants to play the Wii.

590
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:20,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U, and one person is going to be like, hi!

591
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm moving the platforms!

592
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, I'm contributing!

593
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:28,884
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like that dumb person that you have in your room.

594
00:39:28,964 --> 00:39:30,145
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, you know what?

595
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid.

596
00:39:32,908 --> 00:39:33,929
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to keep dying.

597
00:39:33,969 --> 00:39:36,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down.

598
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:38,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that's all he can handle.

599
00:39:39,474 --> 00:39:42,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So five people to play this to its full potential.

600
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:44,458
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's going to sell like crazy in Utah.

601
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:45,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure.

602
00:39:46,605 --> 00:40:03,855
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just, I, if someone even made, I had to laugh, because there was a comment, it was a developer, actually, that was trying stuff on the Wii U, and they were saying, all Nintendo's trying to do is sell a TV-sized DS.

603
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:06,876
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, we've been, he's all, why isn't anybody in the games press saying that?

604
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:09,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, we've been fucking saying that for months.

605
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,779
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all the Wii U's gonna be is just a giant DS.

606
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:13,100
[SPEAKER_11]: DS.

607
00:40:13,761 --> 00:40:24,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the Wii U gamepad works well at a demo kiosk, but when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down at your controller and stuff like that.

608
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:27,278
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't really flow well.

609
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Kanatagram in our chatroom says, Sky, it's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay, I can respect that and all.

610
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:37,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's be real.

611
00:40:38,022 --> 00:40:40,583
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD.

612
00:40:41,163 --> 00:40:43,985
[SPEAKER_03]: F fucking Zero is the game I want to see in HD.

613
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:44,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

614
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:50,107
[SPEAKER_03]: or even a new 3D Mario game would be pretty awesome.

615
00:40:50,127 --> 00:40:52,868
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not exactly the greatest starting point.

616
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:54,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a Metroid Prime in HD.

617
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:58,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you imagine a Super Mario World-esque game in 3D?

618
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Kind of like Zelda-ish big adventure type game?

619
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:03,991
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fucking awesome.

620
00:41:04,451 --> 00:41:05,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Not new Super Mario Bros.

621
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:09,435
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, last comment from chat, and then we're going to move on with the show.

622
00:41:09,496 --> 00:41:10,156
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says,

623
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:27,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay.

624
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:28,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to point this out.

625
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every 3DS game has to whore the 3D like crazy.

626
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a good thing.

627
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:37,549
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3D is subtle and is not a game changer.

628
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:43,936
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a game that whores the 3D but does it very, very, very well, go play the Mario 3D Land because that was...

629
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:53,625
[SPEAKER_03]: An original Mario game, despite the fact that it certainly has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that, because the 3D brought some awesome elements into it.

630
00:41:53,725 --> 00:41:58,929
[SPEAKER_03]: That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day.

631
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So, go figure.

632
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:07,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3D Land, this game feels a little bit like a step backwards.

633
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

634
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:09,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a very harsh thing to say.

635
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:10,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it sound like I don't like the game or something.

636
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:11,938
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think it's about right.

637
00:42:11,978 --> 00:42:12,418
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know.

638
00:42:12,879 --> 00:42:16,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Because 3D Land was actually pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game.

639
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:17,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

640
00:42:18,624 --> 00:42:32,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, New Super Mario Bros., the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've done it now three times, and you're gonna do it again one more time, and you haven't really changed it up that much.

641
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:41,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's basically, like, because even before, it was like, hey, look, we created this tech demo of the Miis running around in, like, this New Super Mario Bros.

642
00:42:41,857 --> 00:42:44,499
[SPEAKER_11]: thing, and that was the Wii U tech demo, and I'm like...

643
00:42:45,439 --> 00:42:46,919
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just new Super Mario Bros.

644
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,540
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have, you know, it was just a tech demo.

645
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,720
[SPEAKER_11]: And then guess what they did?

646
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they did this with all their fucking tech demos.

647
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,001
[SPEAKER_11]: They turned it into a game.

648
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:57,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, oh my fucking god, you didn't do anything.

649
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:04,562
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have four people running around in this game just like you can on the Wii version.

650
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:08,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason.

651
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:13,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll probably still get a Wii U. I got problems.

652
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:15,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I got problems.

653
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:16,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get it at launch.

654
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:17,265
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

655
00:43:17,925 --> 00:43:18,345
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

656
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,608
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing coming... There's nothing.

657
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:25,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite everything I'm saying, despite... Look, I'm just gonna admit it.

658
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:31,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that, the first time I play that new Super Mario Bros.

659
00:43:31,918 --> 00:43:34,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm gonna be like...

660
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it, and I'll have it, because I want it I'm not planning on buying one, I don't need that system, I don't play the Wii enough, I'm, no

661
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:50,674
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on with some gaming news.

662
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:51,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, housekeeping.

663
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit us at twitter.com slash OLR or on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

664
00:43:58,781 --> 00:44:06,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, visit our network that we are affiliated with and tape live at, the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.

665
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:09,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote a review of Sound Shapes, so you can check out that's there.

666
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:14,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some other – a book review went up last week of Stargate by the guy from Critical Myths.

667
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:16,576
[SPEAKER_03]: and lots of good stuff on the site.

668
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:19,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out, vognetwork.com.

669
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:21,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news.

670
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:25,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, just, I guess, tons of Sony shit coming out of Gamescom.

671
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:26,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's tons of stuff.

672
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,356
[SPEAKER_03]: You posted like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what?

673
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:29,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Just do them all.

674
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:30,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do them all.

675
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,361
[SPEAKER_11]: All kind of tied to each other.

676
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:34,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, some non-Sony stuff real quick.

677
00:44:35,002 --> 00:44:37,704
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere.

678
00:44:38,024 --> 00:44:42,006
[SPEAKER_11]: They're calling it kind of the game of Gamescom.

679
00:44:42,106 --> 00:44:45,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Remember Me, which was kind of cool.

680
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:47,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories.

681
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:53,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that twist ending.

682
00:44:54,093 --> 00:44:54,613
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember that?

683
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:55,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Remember Me?

684
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:23,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Puppeteer Sony Online Entertainment

685
00:45:43,857 --> 00:46:05,348
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's very it reminded me of um like Clockwork Knight if you remember that from the Sega Saturn at least that's what it reminded me of but it was a very unique looking game like kind of a platformer with this like puppet looking animation to different things but it's pretty cool so they have that come out

686
00:46:06,448 --> 00:46:10,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game they had was Rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of Limbo.

687
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:15,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Or even that one game, A Lost in Shadow, that came out from Konami.

688
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:26,153
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically a PlayStation Network game that's going to be coming out that features these invisible... Like an invisible boy who can only be seen in rain.

689
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:31,134
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on...

690
00:46:32,774 --> 00:46:36,797
[SPEAKER_11]: and this kind of invisible character, which is kind of neat.

691
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:45,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, I don't know what I should think about this one, but Until Dawn, it's going to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move.

692
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,243
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually sounds kind of awesome.

693
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this is Night Trap bad.

694
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

695
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:59,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the industry needs a good game like... Except without the annoying parts of Night Trap, like watching the monitors.

696
00:46:59,110 --> 00:46:59,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it needs...

697
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:00,532
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

698
00:47:17,288 --> 00:47:19,410
[SPEAKER_11]: and then one other thing.

699
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:27,017
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed off Wonder Book again and I've got to say this presentation of Wonder Book was way better than the one that they did at E3.

700
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:41,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It was shorter and they showed some new stuff including not only are they going to have the whole Book of Spells thing which looked okay in the new trailer but they have this new they got a licensing with BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs which looks pretty awesome and

701
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:48,515
[SPEAKER_11]: and Diggs Nightcrawler which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game.

702
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:53,559
[SPEAKER_11]: You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes kind of.

703
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:55,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds almost like it could be a book.

704
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it might even be a book series but those will be coming out later on.

705
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I think right now Wonder Book is launching with books of spells and that's it.

706
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:10,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so does this mean you have come full circle and you are a fan of Wonder Book now?

707
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a fan of it, no.

708
00:48:12,451 --> 00:48:40,642
[SPEAKER_11]: it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff like I was thinking for the accounts I deal with like I deal with library chain or you know the old libraries in the US and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them or people that sell books but no for me personally no you know what's making a comeback though that ain't got or that Wonderbook ain't got shit on you know what you know what's making a huge comeback brace yourself for it

709
00:48:45,775 --> 00:48:46,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.

710
00:48:46,636 --> 00:48:51,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking Reading Rainbow is back.

711
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

712
00:48:52,322 --> 00:48:55,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's like an iOS type thing now.

713
00:48:55,024 --> 00:49:00,430
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like LeVar Burton pimping books.

714
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:17,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Better how LeVar Burton associated with it Like, okay, here's the thing Imagine if Wonderbook instead had been called Reading Rainbow We would all be losing our shit over it All they had to do was get LeVar Burton out on stage going It's the shit, guys We would have been like, take my money!

715
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:17,927
Take it!

716
00:49:18,347 --> 00:49:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it!

717
00:49:19,928 --> 00:49:21,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the intro to this show

718
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:25,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that old logo too.

719
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:28,281
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so 80s and gorgeous.

720
00:49:28,921 --> 00:49:34,006
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that pissed me off about reading Rainbow is that the books were always checked out at the library.

721
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:36,049
[SPEAKER_03]: You tried to go find the books, they were always gone.

722
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:36,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at my library.

723
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:41,134
[SPEAKER_06]: No one in Alabama reads.

724
00:49:42,275 --> 00:49:43,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Some other cool stuff.

725
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:48,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Before all that, they were showing Media Molecule's new game and

726
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:51,342
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just fantastic.

727
00:49:51,462 --> 00:49:52,743
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game called Tearaway.

728
00:49:53,183 --> 00:49:54,904
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on the Vita.

729
00:49:54,984 --> 00:49:57,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, the whole world looks like paper.

730
00:49:57,665 --> 00:49:59,485
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the stuff you can do in there.

731
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:01,626
[SPEAKER_11]: You can actually interact with the game.

732
00:50:01,646 --> 00:50:04,227
[SPEAKER_11]: You can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel.

733
00:50:04,988 --> 00:50:09,049
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll actually see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird.

734
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:14,871
[SPEAKER_11]: You can literally finger your Vita.

735
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:16,612
[SPEAKER_11]: You can literally finger your Vita.

736
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:26,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion-based stuff, and it looks fantastic because it's medium molecule.

737
00:50:26,514 --> 00:50:27,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

738
00:50:29,216 --> 00:50:29,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

739
00:50:29,657 --> 00:50:33,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touchpad.

740
00:50:34,921 --> 00:50:37,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita.

741
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:38,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

742
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:40,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, you can.

743
00:50:41,592 --> 00:50:45,613
[SPEAKER_11]: They showed off Killzone Mercenary, which is going to be a new first-person shooter on the Vita.

744
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:46,913
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked kind of cool.

745
00:50:47,494 --> 00:51:01,118
[SPEAKER_11]: They also showed Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified, which I was very interested in picking it up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last Resistance game, Burning Skies, and that game sucked.

746
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:03,839
[SPEAKER_11]: So probably not going to pick up this Call of Duty game.

747
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:06,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute?

748
00:51:07,036 --> 00:51:11,979
[SPEAKER_03]: A sitting vampire in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Someone's going to put their dick on it.

749
00:51:12,219 --> 00:51:15,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would happen if you put something besides it?

750
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:17,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Stances like someone hasn't already.

751
00:51:18,302 --> 00:51:21,604
[SPEAKER_11]: What would happen if you put something else on the back touchpad?

752
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:22,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

753
00:51:22,744 --> 00:51:27,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have... It actually is an image of your finger.

754
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:28,807
[SPEAKER_11]: It utilizes the camera.

755
00:51:29,027 --> 00:51:29,928
[SPEAKER_11]: It captures that.

756
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:33,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen.

757
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,591
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were somehow... Or would your penis turn into a finger?

758
00:51:37,112 --> 00:51:37,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

759
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:42,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm assuming it's not... That's a really big finger.

760
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:44,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, for some people, maybe a really small finger.

761
00:51:44,276 --> 00:51:44,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that your thumb?

762
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:51,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you... Because there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that back touch panel.

763
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It just doesn't... It's out of the scope of the lens, but... I don't know.

764
00:51:57,203 --> 00:52:01,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, unless they have you capture your finger, but I think that... Yes.

765
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:03,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does your finger look like a sea cucumber?

766
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:07,424
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the great mysteries.

767
00:52:10,145 --> 00:52:12,946
[SPEAKER_03]: What will happen when you put your dick on the rear touchpad?

768
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:20,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Find out on the next OLR.

769
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:22,210
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll make a mess.

770
00:52:27,932 --> 00:52:29,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to have that trade-in system.

771
00:52:31,353 --> 00:52:32,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I played a lot of Tearaway.

772
00:52:34,494 --> 00:52:39,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Alone at Night.

773
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:40,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

774
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:51,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of innuendos, I guess, Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault is coming to the Vita as well.

775
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,931
[SPEAKER_02]: You did that on purpose.

776
00:52:58,273 --> 00:52:58,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob's red.

777
00:53:01,336 --> 00:53:02,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Full Frontal Assault.

778
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:06,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3.

779
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:15,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing they announced, which is the PlayStation Cross Buy, which is awesome.

780
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:20,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Cross Buy, basically, you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free.

781
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck yeah, that's the way you do it.

782
00:53:23,509 --> 00:53:25,591
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great trend that SoundShape started.

783
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:27,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

784
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Another game that's going to feature that?

785
00:53:29,313 --> 00:53:33,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, though, because this was a good point that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show.

786
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to not just be digital.

787
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:38,739
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my concern, is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally.

788
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:39,900
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be digital, I thought.

789
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3.

790
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:44,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you've got to buy a bigger memory card.

791
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the trick, is that those stinking Vita memory cards are so expensive.

792
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:50,687
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not that expensive.

793
00:53:50,867 --> 00:53:52,108
[SPEAKER_11]: But did they come down in price finally?

794
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:55,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, when they released, the prices of those aren't that expensive.

795
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought it was.

796
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:56,652
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

797
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game that's going to support that as well is going to be PlayStation All-Stars.

798
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,964
[SPEAKER_03]: JV Mon reminds us in chat, play Pinball Arcade on the Vita.

799
00:54:05,145 --> 00:54:05,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that too?

800
00:54:06,507 --> 00:54:07,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it on my phone.

801
00:54:08,189 --> 00:54:08,690
[SPEAKER_07]: On my phone.

802
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need a Vita.

803
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:15,775
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, another game that's going to support that, LittleBigPlanet.

804
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,196
[SPEAKER_11]: The DLC is also cross-platform.

805
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:25,920
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you buy any DLC you have now for LittleBigPlanet 1 and 2, we'll work with LittleBigPlanet Vita and LittleBigPlanet Carding.

806
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,401
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of cool.

807
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:28,101
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

808
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:29,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

809
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:31,442
[SPEAKER_11]: LittleBigPlanet Carding, I hope, is one of those games too.

810
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is one of the cross-buying games.

811
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:34,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

812
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:38,950
[SPEAKER_11]: and then PlayStation Plus coming to the Vita as well.

813
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're upping the cloud storage to one gigabyte.

814
00:54:41,994 --> 00:54:43,876
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

815
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:50,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Also announced that I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption free in September.

816
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:51,287
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty sweet.

817
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:55,188
[SPEAKER_11]: and then also PlayStation Mobile.

818
00:54:55,208 --> 00:55:02,829
[SPEAKER_11]: They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was a big old trailer on there and one of the things I saw I remember was Lemmings.

819
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, holy shit, Lemmings!

820
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,250
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's going to be one of the games.

821
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:20,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, they mentioned that PlayStation Mobile will be compatible with Sony Xperia phones, also Vitas, and then they revealed that the Asus and Wikipad tablets are going to be getting...

822
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:23,055
[SPEAKER_11]: and PlayStation Mobile as well.

823
00:55:23,075 --> 00:55:26,498
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well.

824
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,901
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty cool.

825
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:30,102
[SPEAKER_11]: That's everything.

826
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:32,504
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom.

827
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: But that makes sense because Sony has a pretty big presence in Europe.

828
00:55:35,287 --> 00:55:38,331
[SPEAKER_03]: They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation.

829
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of exciting.

830
00:55:39,812 --> 00:55:42,555
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo Game Show, right?

831
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:43,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

832
00:55:43,836 --> 00:55:44,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

833
00:55:46,098 --> 00:56:02,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited about the whole Vita, Playstation 3 crossover I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita I'm telling you, Sound Shapes is a great They should be pushing it more It's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff

834
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:31,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if that Final Fantasy X remake is going to be buy one get both because they were pimping it for both systems well it's right now it's been first party that's been doing that oh yeah yeah technically it's a that would be pretty cool I mean that might get me to buy the PS3 version of Black Ops 2 maybe if you know it was like that although like I said Black Ops declassified the fact that it's being done by the guys that did Resistance Burning Skies and the trailer just didn't look that great I was just

835
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:34,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, made me sad.

836
00:56:52,532 --> 00:56:54,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it.

837
00:57:12,908 --> 00:57:21,573
[SPEAKER_03]: My big concern about getting one of these right now is that, again, I think I mentioned this last week, they'll just turn around and release a really beautiful color like that purple.

838
00:57:21,673 --> 00:57:24,014
[SPEAKER_03]: That purple 3DS is so gorgeous.

839
00:57:24,054 --> 00:57:26,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that had been the launch color.

840
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,357
[SPEAKER_03]: They would have never had to do another color because that purple one is so great.

841
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:32,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious about the XL.

842
00:57:32,259 --> 00:57:39,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, do I want to pay $200 for a new one when I already have one?

843
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:40,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I can justify that really.

844
00:57:41,664 --> 00:57:42,205
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

845
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:43,526
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's out.

846
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

847
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have some news on the corporate front.

848
00:57:49,672 --> 00:57:51,754
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it in those words.

849
00:57:52,334 --> 00:57:53,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Who remembers OnLive?

850
00:57:55,277 --> 00:58:00,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember their big booth at E3, and nobody thought OnLive was going to work.

851
00:58:00,262 --> 00:58:02,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they showed up at E3, and they were like, this works.

852
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work.

853
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:13,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right now, there was something going around about a sort of bankruptcy going on.

854
00:58:13,582 --> 00:58:18,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the text is crossed over and the HTML is screwed up.

855
00:58:18,886 --> 00:58:21,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was so much back and forth on this this week.

856
00:58:21,848 --> 00:58:24,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really has a clear understanding of what's going on.

857
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:26,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, the coding on this is awful.

858
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:27,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

859
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:34,339
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by a company as a sale.

860
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, it has to do with bankruptcy protection.

861
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:43,830
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, I believe, been acquired, but in kind of a different deal.

862
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:45,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what's different about it?

863
00:58:46,033 --> 00:58:46,774
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't say who.

864
00:58:47,054 --> 00:58:48,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the big thing.

865
00:58:48,896 --> 00:58:49,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that weird?

866
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:52,981
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounded to me that they created their own company.

867
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:54,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Like they created another company.

868
00:58:54,262 --> 00:58:57,706
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to call this On Live 2.

869
00:58:58,527 --> 00:58:59,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Let her finish.

870
00:58:59,108 --> 00:58:59,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Let her finish.

871
00:58:59,548 --> 00:59:00,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get into this a little bit.

872
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:00,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what...

873
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:15,442
[SPEAKER_06]: What the official quote is, like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.

874
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:25,351
[SPEAKER_06]: They are releasing the OnLive employees and I think have put out a call to rehire them with the new company.

875
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:40,724
[SPEAKER_06]: which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked for before when we were sold is that yeah we were released from the previous corporation but we were hired quote by the new company as and we know with all of our tenure and everything intact

876
00:59:41,444 --> 01:00:03,952
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they are sending the note out there that yeah we want you here we want to keep you around you know just maybe trying to get them to reapply through different hiring channels or something I mean maybe they want to bring them all and see you know if they're loyal to the product I don't know

877
01:00:05,046 --> 01:00:05,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

878
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,152
[SPEAKER_03]: They've yet to really say anything officially.

879
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:29,757
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was at the point where people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the online offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff.

880
01:00:30,118 --> 01:00:33,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back.

881
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now.

882
01:00:37,143 --> 01:00:43,549
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry.

883
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:45,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is always tough to talk about.

884
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have to ask the hard question.

885
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:57,915
[SPEAKER_03]: on live, kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was, like, games.

886
01:00:58,796 --> 01:01:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, a lot of the games that it launched with, when launching is your first impression, were years old, and kind of old news.

887
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:11,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, they tried to add to that, and they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff they were doing.

888
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:11,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they...

889
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:16,194
[SPEAKER_03]: and the TV top systems and all that they were doing.

890
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:20,080
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some great ideas, but it's like they just didn't have the games to back it up.

891
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have the deals to back it up like Steam did.

892
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:28,091
[SPEAKER_03]: The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really have to download anything.

893
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: You just did it through the cloud.

894
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:34,055
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't really getting exclusives.

895
01:01:34,555 --> 01:01:35,335
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tricky.

896
01:01:36,116 --> 01:01:38,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see where the company is hurting.

897
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:46,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the report had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were only ever on the service at any one time.

898
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,842
[SPEAKER_11]: 1,600 and they had 8,000 servers.

899
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:52,963
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained.

900
01:01:55,577 --> 01:02:01,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just really... I mean, they clearly... Someone believes in the product.

901
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:08,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to... Well, look at... Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar sort of thing.

902
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:15,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But Gaikai was kind of doing... They had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them.

903
01:02:15,027 --> 01:02:17,208
[SPEAKER_03]: They were kind of trying to push the envelope a little more.

904
01:02:17,828 --> 01:02:19,169
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Sony acquired them.

905
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:19,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

906
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:27,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were offered consulting arrangements.

907
01:02:27,685 --> 01:02:38,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, they said that they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition to the new startup, and those people were offered stock options in the new company.

908
01:02:38,951 --> 01:02:50,357
[SPEAKER_11]: However, those stocks are basically worthless unless the company at some point becomes profitable and basically gets sold or goes public.

909
01:02:50,917 --> 01:03:00,139
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if we, you know, are successful.

910
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:05,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with the whole on live stuff.

911
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:11,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else as we usually feel in these types of situations.

912
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:13,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

913
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, if that's it, let's move on.

914
01:03:18,284 --> 01:03:27,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's going to be coming to PCs, tablets, and internet TVs.

915
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:34,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last year.

916
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:42,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and imminent launch of new

917
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:43,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

918
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:03,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably because I would be willing to bet that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place.

919
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:04,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Like we know Sony does.

920
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Clearly Sony does, right?

921
01:04:06,281 --> 01:04:09,584
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route.

922
01:04:09,664 --> 01:04:13,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not that, yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles.

923
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:18,772
[SPEAKER_11]: More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles.

924
01:04:20,553 --> 01:04:36,288
[SPEAKER_03]: you know one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought OnLive which would seem like a no it's just that's not what happened you know because sometimes Microsoft buys companies but I think in this case they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their own name on it you know what I mean

925
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:41,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't think... And if it was bought by Microsoft, they'd be more... More open about it.

926
01:04:42,051 --> 01:04:42,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair about it.

927
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,252
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to lay everybody off.

928
01:04:44,553 --> 01:04:47,854
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was one of the first early... You know how Twitter goes.

929
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:51,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst.

930
01:04:52,936 --> 01:04:54,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

931
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:05,886
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, they're saying, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they wish to stream from cloud.

932
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:13,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case because if it's not going to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own?

933
01:05:14,191 --> 01:05:15,352
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

934
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:19,194
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an interesting idea and I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but

935
01:05:20,677 --> 01:05:23,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like it's such a crowded market space out there.

936
01:05:23,059 --> 01:05:32,867
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know you can trade in games for these tablets and phones and stuff, but why would I want to buy, why would I want to stream games from them?

937
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,110
[SPEAKER_11]: That just doesn't, I don't know, it just doesn't seem appealing to me at all.

938
01:05:40,115 --> 01:05:46,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of being able to stream demos and things like that without having to download... Like that whole Secret World.

939
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:47,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about that a couple weeks ago.

940
01:05:47,662 --> 01:05:49,524
[SPEAKER_03]: This MMO that I tried out, the Secret World.

941
01:05:49,825 --> 01:05:54,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I don't really have time for this right now.

942
01:05:55,030 --> 01:06:00,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like this to make my opinion.

943
01:06:01,016 --> 01:06:02,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this.

944
01:06:03,058 --> 01:06:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to be so MMO-centric, but, you know, it's kind of what comes to mind.

945
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great use for the streaming technology is the demos.

946
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:14,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way?

947
01:06:15,088 --> 01:06:17,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but... Yeah, that's another thing.

948
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:27,378
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, you know, with some of these devices, you know, not everybody's upgraded their wireless networks, so you may be running wireless G, and that's going to throttle you a little bit, and...

949
01:06:29,953 --> 01:06:34,244
[SPEAKER_11]: or, you know, you have to be connected to the Wi-Fi for this stuff to work for the most part.

950
01:06:35,407 --> 01:06:35,708
[SPEAKER_11]: I just...

951
01:06:37,485 --> 01:06:40,567
[SPEAKER_03]: My tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the Wi-Fi too.

952
01:06:40,948 --> 01:06:44,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be connected to Wi-Fi and then once every 15 minutes it just drops for 15 seconds.

953
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:48,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And that'll kill your game if I'm trying to stream gamings off that.

954
01:06:48,273 --> 01:06:51,315
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't like dealing with GameStop.

955
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,415
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of where it's at.

956
01:06:52,435 --> 01:06:53,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a good point.

957
01:06:53,836 --> 01:06:58,039
[SPEAKER_11]: They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase them.

958
01:06:58,579 --> 01:06:59,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know it's going to happen.

959
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:08,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well this is a game that maybe some of you will be streaming through a console later, unconfirmed, but I don't know, it's a big game.

960
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:10,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken Tag Tournament 2.

961
01:07:12,572 --> 01:07:13,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You excited about this?

962
01:07:13,974 --> 01:07:18,438
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some more information that came out about this from Gamescom.

963
01:07:18,478 --> 01:07:20,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Tekken Tag Tournament 2, it will support 3D.

964
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:24,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have 3D fighting and kicking and all that.

965
01:07:24,802 --> 01:07:25,942
[SPEAKER_03]: 3D can be switched on or off.

966
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:29,084
[SPEAKER_03]: The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there.

967
01:07:29,464 --> 01:07:36,346
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also something called Tekken Tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever.

968
01:07:36,746 --> 01:07:40,868
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also Fight Lab which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics.

969
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:47,730
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a robot fighter named Combot and you will practice your techniques on that in order to get through the Fight Lab.

970
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:48,550
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

971
01:08:09,861 --> 01:08:10,521
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura?

972
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:39,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV

973
01:08:59,426 --> 01:08:59,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

974
01:09:00,927 --> 01:09:09,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically they have this thing called a Realm Reborn, which is the relaunch of Final Fantasy XIV.

975
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:21,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's an interview with Naoki Yoshida who is saying that losing your fans' trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard.

976
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:29,506
[SPEAKER_06]: They really think that they're going to be able to regain the fans' trust by rebuilding Final Fantasy XIV.

977
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:31,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want that to be where they launch it from.

978
01:09:31,988 --> 01:09:33,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Say, hey, this is great.

979
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,329
[SPEAKER_06]: What's XV and XVI going to be like?

980
01:09:35,549 --> 01:09:37,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, stop numbering them.

981
01:09:37,987 --> 01:09:40,129
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't be online MMOs, let's hope

982
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:19,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the Final Fantasy series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving up on 14th.

983
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:23,723
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about XIII?

984
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:28,065
[SPEAKER_03]: But XIII wasn't, they wouldn't have made XIII too if XIII was a failure.

985
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:34,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just straight up didn't like XIII, which I can get the reasons why people weren't into XIII.

986
01:10:34,867 --> 01:10:35,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it an awful lot.

987
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:38,049
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed.

988
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:38,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

989
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:39,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

990
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point, Internet.

991
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:43,151
[SPEAKER_06]: It just means that you don't like it.

992
01:10:43,311 --> 01:10:44,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Other people do.

993
01:10:44,352 --> 01:10:44,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

994
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:45,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Get over it.

995
01:10:45,872 --> 01:10:48,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't take, this is, okay, I have to rant a minute.

996
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:54,936
[SPEAKER_06]: It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, oh, well, I do, you're wrong.

997
01:10:55,496 --> 01:10:57,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, well, I do as if I'm wrong.

998
01:10:57,917 --> 01:10:58,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Or vice versa.

999
01:11:00,618 --> 01:11:11,423
[SPEAKER_06]: One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection on you, oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth.

1000
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, end of rant.

1001
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,585
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can all agree Final Fantasy XIV was bad, right?

1002
01:11:17,805 --> 01:11:18,446
[SPEAKER_03]: We can all agree on that.

1003
01:11:18,466 --> 01:11:18,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play it.

1004
01:11:19,027 --> 01:11:20,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not.

1005
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:21,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably was.

1006
01:11:21,672 --> 01:11:25,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it, but from what I heard... Oh, I'm just trying to make a joke.

1007
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:27,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously somebody's paying for it out there.

1008
01:11:27,461 --> 01:11:28,663
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't have any servers running.

1009
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:31,548
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it.

1010
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,352
[SPEAKER_06]: There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do.

1011
01:11:34,432 --> 01:11:38,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group.

1012
01:11:39,197 --> 01:11:42,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Breakman says, some of us like Final Fantasy XIII.

1013
01:11:42,441 --> 01:11:44,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Jvmon says, I like XIII.

1014
01:11:44,344 --> 01:11:46,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan says, hey, I liked XIII.

1015
01:11:46,246 --> 01:11:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like XII.

1016
01:11:47,347 --> 01:11:49,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked what I played of it, I just got a little bored.

1017
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:52,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Busters says XIII was still commercially successful.

1018
01:11:52,953 --> 01:11:55,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy XIII too.

1019
01:11:56,016 --> 01:11:59,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't like Dash 2 as much, just because of that ending.

1020
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,922
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it's the whole...

1021
01:12:02,743 --> 01:12:05,485
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1022
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:36,915
[SPEAKER_03]: JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy 7, but respect other people's opinions who differ from my own.

1023
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:38,076
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1024
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:38,957
[SPEAKER_03]: A model citizen.

1025
01:12:39,237 --> 01:12:39,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1026
01:12:41,059 --> 01:12:43,801
[SPEAKER_03]: RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem Forever.

1027
01:12:45,502 --> 01:12:46,823
[SPEAKER_06]: You are entitled to like it.

1028
01:12:48,385 --> 01:12:49,525
[SPEAKER_06]: You are entitled to like it.

1029
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:53,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally think that it was, what's a good description?

1030
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,751
[SPEAKER_06]: A festering pile of shit, but...

1031
01:13:01,873 --> 01:13:03,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I love 10 and 10 too.

1032
01:13:03,315 --> 01:13:03,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1033
01:13:05,238 --> 01:13:07,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Brakeman says, stop talking about my low self-esteem.

1034
01:13:07,281 --> 01:13:07,721
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you?

1035
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:08,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what are we talking about?

1036
01:13:09,323 --> 01:13:09,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

1037
01:13:12,714 --> 01:13:13,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it is.

1038
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:26,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and poo-poo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, damn it, politics.

1039
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:33,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a little bit more important, but it's... Now, video games are the most important thing.

1040
01:13:33,762 --> 01:13:34,683
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1041
01:13:36,723 --> 01:13:40,145
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's at the same time as like, okay, Final Fantasy...

1042
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:44,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV, they're looking at it as a failure.

1043
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiscally, it's probably a failure for them.

1044
01:13:48,531 --> 01:13:51,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple servers up.

1045
01:13:51,312 --> 01:13:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a little bit unprecedented.

1046
01:13:54,073 --> 01:14:02,075
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what your personal opinion is on XIV, if you think we're too hard on it or what, it is unprecedented for a game company to come out and apologize for a game.

1047
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:02,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1048
01:14:04,438 --> 01:14:07,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are taking steps to fix it.

1049
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:10,480
[SPEAKER_06]: They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging.

1050
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:11,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1051
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:20,443
[SPEAKER_06]: And for all the people out there, like, what brought me to this point, regardless, say 13 was a failure, fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean.

1052
01:14:20,643 --> 01:14:21,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a failure?

1053
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1054
01:14:21,864 --> 01:14:23,865
[SPEAKER_06]: It made them buckets of money.

1055
01:14:25,768 --> 01:14:33,592
[SPEAKER_03]: GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F-Zero, but I respect that it is a great game, just not a racing game I like.

1056
01:14:33,632 --> 01:14:35,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.

1057
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:36,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1058
01:14:37,454 --> 01:14:38,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Now go sit in the corner.

1059
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:39,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's me.

1060
01:14:39,635 --> 01:14:40,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like strategy games.

1061
01:14:42,236 --> 01:14:43,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it.

1062
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Love World of Warcraft.

1063
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:46,918
[SPEAKER_03]: The third time.

1064
01:14:49,677 --> 01:14:49,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth.

1065
01:14:50,117 --> 01:14:50,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth, Rob.

1066
01:14:50,598 --> 01:14:50,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Fourth.

1067
01:14:50,998 --> 01:14:51,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

1068
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:52,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Fourth time's the charm.

1069
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:55,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I played with each expansion until I liked it.

1070
01:14:56,862 --> 01:14:58,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, I love the universe.

1071
01:14:58,523 --> 01:15:00,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate the first series of games.

1072
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:01,264
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

1073
01:15:02,285 --> 01:15:04,987
[SPEAKER_06]: It just has to... Personal preference...

1074
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:07,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy VIII.

1075
01:15:07,668 --> 01:15:11,890
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not the story that bothers me, it's that fucking fighting system ruined.

1076
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:12,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1077
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:14,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved the story so much.

1078
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:17,191
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time I got to the third disc, four for reals.

1079
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:24,254
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole point is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it for what it is.

1080
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:25,535
[SPEAKER_06]: How much money did it make?

1081
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:27,335
[SPEAKER_06]: How big of a player base does it have?

1082
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:31,697
[SPEAKER_06]: That determines in the terms... That's what the stockholders are looking at.

1083
01:15:31,957 --> 01:15:32,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1084
01:15:32,798 --> 01:15:37,280
[SPEAKER_06]: That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not.

1085
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for everyone who bought Final Fantasy XIII and hate it, they still got the money.

1086
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: They like it.

1087
01:15:43,143 --> 01:15:43,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1088
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:44,544
[SPEAKER_06]: They still got your money at one.

1089
01:15:45,384 --> 01:15:45,804
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

1090
01:15:46,685 --> 01:15:52,348
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you've got an ongoing product that people are going to pay a subscription for, that's a different story.

1091
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:54,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And for that you have to deliver month after month.

1092
01:15:55,925 --> 01:16:00,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial new releases are coming out this week.

1093
01:16:01,398 --> 01:16:03,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see.

1094
01:16:03,683 --> 01:16:04,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start in the U.S., Loki.

1095
01:16:05,509 --> 01:16:06,249
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to be short.

1096
01:16:07,190 --> 01:16:10,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Transformers, Fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360.

1097
01:16:11,571 --> 01:16:11,871
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1098
01:16:12,411 --> 01:16:12,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Dang.

1099
01:16:13,052 --> 01:16:16,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we did just have a system launch today in a big Nintendo game.

1100
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:18,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not technically a new system.

1101
01:16:18,793 --> 01:16:22,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about as new as, say, New Super Mario Bros.

1102
01:16:22,315 --> 01:16:22,295
2.

1103
01:16:22,395 --> 01:16:25,356
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some big PC games in a couple weeks, too.

1104
01:16:25,736 --> 01:16:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's that.

1105
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:31,599
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to Japan.

1106
01:16:31,919 --> 01:16:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well.

1107
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:39,165
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Xbox 360, there is the Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition.

1108
01:16:39,405 --> 01:16:42,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week.

1109
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:45,670
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing on the 360 in Japan.

1110
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:51,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, on the PlayStation 3, No More Heroes Red Zone Edition gets the best treatments.

1111
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:52,456
[SPEAKER_03]: That means a price reduction.

1112
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:54,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I don't know what this is.

1113
01:16:54,297 --> 01:16:55,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hybrid disc.

1114
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a game and an anime.

1115
01:16:57,921 --> 01:17:04,206
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rine no Lagrange, Kamogawa Days, and it's the game and the anime.

1116
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:09,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation 3 happen a little bit is that you have the game slash movie or whatever.

1117
01:17:09,631 --> 01:17:11,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a PlayStation Network game and the movie.

1118
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:12,193
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1119
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:46,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Why I don't have a Vita Maybe you'll have to get one for Hatsune Miku Project Diva F You're not a Project Diva fan?

1120
01:17:46,463 --> 01:17:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were I am, but I don't have a Vita, so what does it matter?

1121
01:17:49,965 --> 01:18:08,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well you can get, in Japan, on the 30th, you can get a Vita Hatsune Miku Limited Edition Well I'll let the people who actually have jobs and money get one for me You should sell Etsy's to fund your Vita The fuck would I make on Etsy?

1122
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:13,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm selling my rage!

1123
01:18:13,853 --> 01:18:20,641
[SPEAKER_06]: You get an mp3 of me going You can record people's voicemail messages.

1124
01:18:22,443 --> 01:18:24,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you could set up their voicemail messages.

1125
01:18:24,265 --> 01:18:26,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is DarkSakura, go away.

1126
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:27,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Beep!

1127
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:32,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is DarkSakura from Orange Lounge Radio.

1128
01:18:32,068 --> 01:18:35,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are I don't like you or your friend, but leave a message anyway.

1129
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:35,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1130
01:18:35,769 --> 01:18:39,670
[SPEAKER_11]: That reminds me, I got to record a voicemail message for my Google.

1131
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:47,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my Google voice number that apparently Omaha Steaks likes calling daily to market me.

1132
01:18:48,052 --> 01:18:49,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot that I had set it up.

1133
01:18:49,192 --> 01:18:50,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you buy steaks from them once or something?

1134
01:18:50,773 --> 01:18:52,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I had a gift card that I won.

1135
01:18:52,513 --> 01:18:58,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was like, okay, I got to make a number that they can call and I got to make an email address that they can email to.

1136
01:18:58,854 --> 01:19:04,215
[SPEAKER_11]: So I gave them the email address I don't use and then I gave them that phone number.

1137
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:11,577
[SPEAKER_11]: So now I need to figure out how to forward that to, I don't know, the void.

1138
01:19:11,597 --> 01:19:13,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is Loki's voicemail.

1139
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:14,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Please leave a message.

1140
01:19:14,298 --> 01:19:16,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're Omaha Steaks, then fuck off.

1141
01:19:17,659 --> 01:19:18,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1142
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll record it for you.

1143
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:24,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're trying to sell shit, then get lost.

1144
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:27,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless you're going to send me free steak, in which case you can send me free steak.

1145
01:19:28,743 --> 01:19:30,464
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not free, I don't fucking care.

1146
01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:40,451
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Nintendo 3DS, Boku wa Koku Kansai-kan, Airport Hero 3D Honolulu.

1147
01:19:41,112 --> 01:19:46,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea what Airport Hero is, but I imagine in my head it's a lot like the... What's that?

1148
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Pocket Planes on the iOS system.

1149
01:19:49,497 --> 01:19:50,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Or on the iOS.

1150
01:19:50,378 --> 01:19:51,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, something like that.

1151
01:19:51,339 --> 01:19:52,019
[SPEAKER_03]: iPhone and all that.

1152
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:53,601
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's it for Japanese release dates.

1153
01:19:53,801 --> 01:19:54,922
[SPEAKER_03]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1154
01:19:55,803 --> 01:19:56,724
[SPEAKER_06]: A few things, a few.

1155
01:19:57,565 --> 01:20:02,671
[SPEAKER_06]: We have on the 21st, Darksiders 2 and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD.

1156
01:20:03,452 --> 01:20:05,815
[SPEAKER_06]: God, that series has been out in Japan for like, what, ever?

1157
01:20:06,996 --> 01:20:08,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Since like, the mid-80s?

1158
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:10,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just now getting stuff for it?

1159
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:10,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just...

1160
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:12,362
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever.

1161
01:20:12,662 --> 01:20:16,065
[SPEAKER_06]: 22nd, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure HD on the PS3.

1162
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:25,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the 24th, Dark Souls for PC, Endless Space for PC, and Transformers Fall of Cybertron, which is all my friend has ever talked about and I don't care anymore.

1163
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:28,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Origins

1164
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:56,152
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming to Mac, because they have games on the Mac, so of course it would.

1165
01:20:56,713 --> 01:21:07,418
[SPEAKER_11]: So of course, Peter Moore announced that during Gamescom, it's going to be coming to a few different platforms, including smart TVs, the Mac, Android, and Facebook.

1166
01:21:08,299 --> 01:21:19,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're also going to be adding some new features, including free-to-play gaming, which is, I think, where the Facebook and Android comes into play, and achievements.

1167
01:21:21,641 --> 01:21:22,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Hurrah!

1168
01:21:24,925 --> 01:21:25,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurray!

1169
01:21:25,426 --> 01:21:28,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on the Mac.

1170
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:32,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that doesn't necessarily mean the games are coming out on those systems, but Origin will be there.

1171
01:21:33,413 --> 01:21:37,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Origin cannot... This boggles my mind.

1172
01:21:37,296 --> 01:21:42,860
[SPEAKER_03]: If Alan and I want to play our two friends at the same house in the Bay Area, we can't do it.

1173
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Origin can't handle two people in one place versus two in another place.

1174
01:21:46,943 --> 01:21:50,046
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do two on one, or them two against one.

1175
01:21:50,066 --> 01:21:51,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do two on two.

1176
01:21:51,527 --> 01:21:53,048
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not possible in Origin's setup.

1177
01:21:54,082 --> 01:21:54,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1178
01:21:55,583 --> 01:21:55,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1179
01:21:57,264 --> 01:21:58,645
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet Steam can handle that.

1180
01:21:59,786 --> 01:22:02,968
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, we haven't tried, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.

1181
01:22:03,428 --> 01:22:08,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never really had a game that failed miserably playing it through Steam.

1182
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:11,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a great Civ V match not that long ago.

1183
01:22:12,154 --> 01:22:14,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Borderlands is through GameSpy, so that's a little different.

1184
01:22:15,436 --> 01:22:17,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't measure that, so whatever.

1185
01:22:18,328 --> 01:22:18,568
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1186
01:22:19,608 --> 01:22:24,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of underappreciated classics, the Neo Geo.

1187
01:22:24,349 --> 01:22:25,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the Neo Geo?

1188
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:27,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've looked at one the other day.

1189
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:28,710
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got one in your house, right?

1190
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:29,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two, actually.

1191
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:31,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Those fuckers are expensive, too.

1192
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a Neo Geo and a Neo CD.

1193
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:33,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how Dan got his Neo Geo?

1194
01:22:34,452 --> 01:22:36,232
[SPEAKER_06]: He traded a Sega CD for it.

1195
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:37,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1196
01:22:37,812 --> 01:22:39,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you might have to make room on the shelf for this.

1197
01:22:39,973 --> 01:22:42,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Neo Geo X Gold.

1198
01:22:42,873 --> 01:22:43,434
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1199
01:22:43,734 --> 01:22:45,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new system.

1200
01:22:46,174 --> 01:23:08,574
[SPEAKER_03]: and now there were rumors about this before that this was coming but it is confirmed the Neo Geo X Gold is a thing it's a $200 thing hey Neo Geos were never known for being cheap right now the cool thing is though even for being a $200 system it does come with a bunch of pre-installed games these games used to be like $200 a piece if you remember but

1201
01:23:09,294 --> 01:23:20,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Such classics like Art of Fighting 2, Magician Lord, Metal Slug, Baseball Stars 2, Fatal Fury and Fatal Fury Special, King of Fighters 95, Samurai Showdown 2, King of the Monsters.

1202
01:23:20,420 --> 01:23:21,181
[SPEAKER_03]: All this is built in.

1203
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:22,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I have four of those games already.

1204
01:23:22,681 --> 01:23:25,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of, I mean, and I'm only reading part of the list.

1205
01:23:25,283 --> 01:23:28,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a good, looks like about 20 games or so that are installed.

1206
01:23:29,845 --> 01:23:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed though, I don't see Bust a Move on this list.

1207
01:23:32,567 --> 01:23:33,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see, or

1208
01:23:33,948 --> 01:23:35,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Puzzle Bob or whatever you want to call it.

1209
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:36,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, these are all SNK games.

1210
01:23:37,255 --> 01:23:38,337
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Taito.

1211
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:38,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

1212
01:23:38,938 --> 01:23:39,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.

1213
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, there is also this... I guess here's the weird thing.

1214
01:23:44,672 --> 01:23:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a handheld, so it's a handheld system, but it's also, I guess, you can plug it into a docking station, and then it's a TV thing, too?

1215
01:23:55,499 --> 01:23:56,900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool, I gotta say.

1216
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:58,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a docking station that's a video out.

1217
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:00,022
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

1218
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:08,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that's pretty cool that my Dingu does the same thing, and was a whole hell of a lot cheaper, and yeah.

1219
01:24:09,928 --> 01:24:13,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of cool, but $200 is a steep price to pay for nostalgia.

1220
01:24:14,052 --> 01:24:27,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, you can purchase one of those 48-in-1, 60-in-1 Neo Geo arcade cards and get a Super Gun for way fucking cheaper than that.

1221
01:24:27,544 --> 01:24:28,585
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a Super Gun.

1222
01:24:28,685 --> 01:24:30,047
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like an all-in-one card thing.

1223
01:24:30,768 --> 01:24:34,613
[SPEAKER_11]: That literally plugs into Neo Geo controllers.

1224
01:24:34,694 --> 01:24:36,096
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pinned out for that.

1225
01:24:36,496 --> 01:24:41,504
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a 61 cart, so... Nope, not gonna buy it.

1226
01:24:43,075 --> 01:24:43,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

1227
01:24:45,177 --> 01:24:47,999
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing would have to be really something special in order to get me to buy it.

1228
01:24:48,059 --> 01:24:54,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, though, the little joystick they have with it is like a mock replica.

1229
01:24:54,183 --> 01:24:56,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are rock solid, those controllers with the four buttons.

1230
01:24:57,365 --> 01:24:58,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice controller.

1231
01:24:58,807 --> 01:24:59,427
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that.

1232
01:25:00,408 --> 01:25:00,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I love ours.

1233
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:01,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Your game doesn't have that.

1234
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:07,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I love them, honestly, playing all these games, because it's the arcade experience.

1235
01:25:07,193 --> 01:25:08,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll give it that.

1236
01:25:08,834 --> 01:25:09,414
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

1237
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:18,932
[SPEAKER_03]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase milkshake.

1238
01:25:19,329 --> 01:25:26,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's take a trip back down memory lane to a time when the Neo Geo was, you know, more relevant.

1239
01:25:26,213 --> 01:25:28,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you did not pick a Neo Geo game tonight, did you?

1240
01:25:28,955 --> 01:25:29,515
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not.

1241
01:25:29,735 --> 01:25:30,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, that's okay.

1242
01:25:31,336 --> 01:25:42,082
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to go down the archives of classic gaming and DarkSakura is going to jump into the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, even though you might not be able to find it, you kids should play this game right now.

1243
01:25:42,923 --> 01:25:45,344
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1244
01:25:45,924 --> 01:25:46,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Troubleshooter.

1245
01:25:47,745 --> 01:25:48,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone remember this game?

1246
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:55,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on the Sega Genesis.

1247
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:56,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It has awesome music.

1248
01:25:58,173 --> 01:25:58,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Play a little bit of it here.

1249
01:25:59,133 --> 01:26:00,995
Assassination Cult.

1250
01:26:06,915 --> 01:26:08,697
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is such a freaking parody, I love it.

1251
01:26:29,855 --> 01:26:34,978
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is a real... It basically just makes fun of itself the whole time.

1252
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:41,582
[SPEAKER_06]: You play as a girl named Madison, who is a combat operative who has to rescue a prince that has been taken hostage.

1253
01:26:42,143 --> 01:26:44,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And she goes around with her partner, Crystal.

1254
01:26:45,525 --> 01:26:51,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, basically, you play as Madison, and Crystal's kind of attached to her butt...

1255
01:26:52,809 --> 01:26:55,070
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the only way I can describe their positioning.

1256
01:26:55,971 --> 01:27:02,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And Crystal always points backwards, but you can flip her to point in the front.

1257
01:27:02,794 --> 01:27:05,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's invulnerable to enemy fire.

1258
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:09,197
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one who has the hitbox is Madison, who you're playing as.

1259
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:25,110
[SPEAKER_06]: and Crystal is only affected if Madison dies so basically you have a special weapon that helps you during combat and like I said you can flip back and forth you can flip your partner back and forth but you are always facing to the right

1260
01:27:26,812 --> 01:27:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: and you've got different power-ups.

1261
01:27:28,873 --> 01:27:32,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny, when you get a power-up, she goes, Thank you!

1262
01:27:33,297 --> 01:27:33,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that.

1263
01:27:34,778 --> 01:27:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And they make little noises when they get hurt and everything.

1264
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,301
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bubble comes up and says, Ouch!

1265
01:27:39,561 --> 01:27:40,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so cute.

1266
01:27:41,443 --> 01:27:44,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But it didn't really have a life system.

1267
01:27:44,645 --> 01:27:47,447
[SPEAKER_06]: You stocked up hit points by getting life-up icons.

1268
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:54,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it had a sequel in Japan called Battlemania Daiginjo.

1269
01:27:54,973 --> 01:28:01,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we're going to move forward into what makes this game special, and I'm talking more about Battlemania.

1270
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:06,384
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of slow-paced.

1271
01:28:07,445 --> 01:28:12,209
[SPEAKER_06]: It has this sort of, like I said, the weird playing style in it.

1272
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:17,194
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically, oh, and in Japan they were called Mania and Maria, sorry.

1273
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:36,361
[SPEAKER_06]: um they basically go down and shoot weird machines and um it had some really fun stuff thrown in like um uh they had an issue in the game now this was um because uh

1274
01:28:38,380 --> 01:29:05,652
[SPEAKER_06]: the group they were working with which was Studio Uchu Tetsujin which is also called Studio Space Iron Man did not like that Victokai worked for Super Famicom so they had an interesting little easter egg thrown into the game where if you press start, right, and C on the second controller the two heroines in the game will shoot past the Sega logo and you will see Madison jumping up and down on the Super Famicom

1275
01:29:06,773 --> 01:29:08,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

1276
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:12,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega does what Nintendo...

1277
01:29:16,507 --> 01:29:18,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not in the English version.

1278
01:29:21,652 --> 01:29:30,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, as things went along, this was going into the sequel, the Battlemania Daigangel.

1279
01:29:31,761 --> 01:29:35,024
[SPEAKER_06]: It had mushrooms come out that...

1280
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:46,893
[SPEAKER_06]: were part of the power-ups, and it had a fleet of, well, guys that looked like Kate Mario that you had to shoot down.

1281
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:54,658
[SPEAKER_06]: There was also just a bunch of stuff that was going on with this.

1282
01:29:55,499 --> 01:30:05,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's an official picture that came out where it shows the girls playing volleyball

1283
01:30:06,387 --> 01:30:09,589
[SPEAKER_06]: with a Super Famicom and a Hammer.

1284
01:30:11,303 --> 01:30:13,885
[SPEAKER_06]: and then in the game Segagaga.

1285
01:30:14,626 --> 01:30:15,506
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember that one, right?

1286
01:30:15,526 --> 01:30:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you have to basically, you're trying to save Sega from financial ruin.

1287
01:30:20,771 --> 01:30:30,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they get helped in the end of the game by a bunch of characters from their games and out come the two ladies from Battlemania.

1288
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:37,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, the game itself is definitely a big poop on Nintendo.

1289
01:30:38,402 --> 01:30:39,723
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, it's just really fun.

1290
01:30:39,823 --> 01:30:41,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a fun little shooter.

1291
01:30:41,986 --> 01:30:47,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is a game that I would love to have a copy of, either the US one or the Japanese one.

1292
01:30:47,991 --> 01:30:51,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I would just be giddy if I had this game.

1293
01:30:53,196 --> 01:30:55,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I haven't seen it since I was in high school.

1294
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:57,921
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was a fun game.

1295
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:02,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Troubleshooter.

1296
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:07,468
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1297
01:31:07,968 --> 01:31:09,189
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't go anywhere, guys.

1298
01:31:09,209 --> 01:31:26,758
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a break and then when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, your Twitter questions at twitter.com slash OLR, the Fugle question of the week, some stuff going on with Valve, some stuff on the Wii U and your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com all after a quick break.

[SPEAKER_03]: Right, Jamie?

1300
01:31:29,182 --> 01:31:31,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, something special for you guys tonight.

01:31:35,265 --> 01:31:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a track from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack scored by Jesper Kidd.

1303
01:31:39,747 --> 01:31:44,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Big thanks to Something Else Music Works, www.sumthing.com

1306
01:31:59,234 --> 01:32:04,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, Jesper Kidd from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack with The Corruption.

1307
01:32:04,356 --> 01:32:08,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You're participating with Orange Lounge Radio at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

1308
01:32:08,618 --> 01:32:08,598
... ...

1309
01:32:15,651 --> 01:32:16,513
Thanks for watching!

1310
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:58,021
Thank you for watching!

1311
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:40,488
Thanks for watching!

1312
01:36:28,593 --> 01:36:29,520
Thanks for watching!

1313
01:37:10,766 --> 01:37:20,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 4, excuse me, yeah, 470, I lost count for a minute there, for this August 19th, 2012.

1314
01:37:22,015 --> 01:37:28,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was awesome, thanks again to Something Music for letting us play that during the break there, that was great.

1315
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:36,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that was The Corruption from the Darksiders 2 soundtrack by Jesper Kidd, that was really cool, hoped you guys liked that too.

1316
01:37:36,926 --> 01:37:37,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1317
01:37:37,406 --> 01:37:37,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was nice.

1318
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:45,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks in chat there, DungeonBuster says, at live.vognetwork.com says, I thought Kid did a great job on the Darksiders 2 stuff.

1319
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,356
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a base theme in this one that runs into other pieces.

1320
01:37:49,736 --> 01:37:50,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

1321
01:37:51,558 --> 01:37:59,564
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to get back into the show with some rapid fire news, some quick news stories here, and we'll start it off with Loki.

1322
01:38:00,325 --> 01:38:05,329
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so the Vita is getting some new firmware soon, version 1.8.

1323
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:19,104
[SPEAKER_11]: and this is kind of cool because one of the complaints about the Vita before were with the visually impaired having trouble accessing stuff on the Vita because there was no button controls on the home screen.

1324
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:20,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's going to change.

1325
01:38:20,225 --> 01:38:28,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that there will be button controls on the home screen, you'll be able to use the directional pad and stuff to navigate those screens and...

1326
01:38:29,054 --> 01:38:29,274
[SPEAKER_11]: and so on.

1327
01:38:54,508 --> 01:39:02,857
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's going to be a new cross controller icon in the remote play for the cross controller supporting games.

1328
01:39:04,638 --> 01:39:06,040
[SPEAKER_11]: And then other tweaks, I'm sure.

1329
01:39:08,177 --> 01:39:08,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Black Ops 2

1330
01:39:38,778 --> 01:39:39,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1331
01:39:59,881 --> 01:40:01,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something that they're adding in there.

1332
01:40:01,843 --> 01:40:10,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, League Play is going to be added in as well as the option to do live streams of your gameplay.

1333
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:15,013
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can have live streams and you can also do shoutcasts of commentary.

1334
01:40:15,033 --> 01:40:15,434
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can have

1335
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:43,385
[SPEAKER_11]: commentary going over the whole thing as well and that's built into the goddamn game that's interesting I guess some people harnessing the types of things we see on like Ustream and Twitch TV and all that interesting yeah so that's pretty cool and then there's also a rumor that Black Ops 2 is heading to the Wii U according to a QA tester's resume who was on LinkedIn I'm just gonna make it easy for you it's not a fucking rumor it's coming on the Wii U I mean I've been saying it for weeks now so it is coming on the Wii U

1336
01:40:44,105 --> 01:40:48,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I know because I've seen the UPC and other things.

1337
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:50,289
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, duh.

1338
01:40:50,389 --> 01:40:50,969
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

1339
01:40:51,009 --> 01:40:56,993
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be a simple port of the other games, and Treyarch supports the Wii, so it's going to be coming out.

1340
01:40:57,433 --> 01:41:09,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of the Wii U, SpotPass is apparently going to be a feature of the Wii U. This, again, really strikes me as a type of duh, but it is going around the internet this week that I guess it's kind of the new version of Wii Connect 24, which, you know,

1341
01:41:09,861 --> 01:41:14,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that was a thing that your Wii U was always on, but it's not used as well as it could be.

1342
01:41:15,363 --> 01:41:21,024
[SPEAKER_03]: SpotPass, a little better on the DS, so hopefully they're going to implement that more and more through the Nintendo platforms.

1343
01:41:21,664 --> 01:41:26,726
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all coming from a photo of a Wii U development kit that the Wii U will have the SpotPass feature.

1344
01:41:26,806 --> 01:41:27,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on, of course.

1345
01:41:28,462 --> 01:41:29,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Ninja Metroid Other M

1346
01:41:49,873 --> 01:41:52,215
[SPEAKER_03]: which, you know, was kind of met with mixed reaction.

1347
01:41:52,435 --> 01:41:53,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody was into it.

1348
01:41:53,495 --> 01:41:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty good, but, you know, nothing has yet to top Super Metroid for me.

1349
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:00,500
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nothing's even really come close, honestly.

1350
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,741
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Fusion?

1351
01:42:04,222 --> 01:42:05,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Close, but still doesn't top it.

1352
01:42:06,424 --> 01:42:10,767
[SPEAKER_03]: The closest thing I would say would be the Metroid Zero, Zero Mission, was probably the closest.

1353
01:42:10,787 --> 01:42:11,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the one I'm thinking of?

1354
01:42:11,607 --> 01:42:12,508
[SPEAKER_03]: That was on the Game Boy Advance.

1355
01:42:14,344 --> 01:42:36,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Ninja's Yosuke Hayashi says that they are still close to Nintendo and the designer Yoshio Sakamoto Apparently they were both directors of Metroid Other M on the Wii And according to Hayashi, Team Ninja wants to work with Nintendo on another Metroid title

1356
01:42:36,397 --> 01:43:02,864
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of out of our meaning Team Ninja's League as it's Nintendo's game but we're still in close touch with so co-creator Sakamoto-san so we want to do something with him moving forward definitely it really depends on what he wants to do with the game first so you know kind of like a a peace offering there I mean but again at the end of the day if Metroid Other M didn't sell which I don't believe it did sell up to expectations I don't know what the future is going to hold for Metroid but I can't

1357
01:43:03,342 --> 01:43:04,923
[SPEAKER_06]: They totally screwed up with Samus in that game.

1358
01:43:27,850 --> 01:43:30,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Las Ketchup with The Ketchup Song.

1359
01:43:30,131 --> 01:43:31,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that, Jen, from back in the day?

1360
01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:32,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

1361
01:43:32,973 --> 01:43:33,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's current.

1362
01:43:35,535 --> 01:43:37,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Bieber featuring Nicki Minaj.

1363
01:43:38,036 --> 01:43:39,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Beauty and a beat.

1364
01:43:39,577 --> 01:43:41,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know that that was a thing.

1365
01:43:41,278 --> 01:43:43,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I know it is a thing, it's a thing I'd like to not hear.

1366
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know she had beauty.

1367
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:48,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... She's the beat.

1368
01:43:48,803 --> 01:43:50,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Bieber, I guess, is beauty.

1369
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,565
[SPEAKER_03]: A beautiful lesbian.

1370
01:43:51,645 --> 01:43:52,145
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1371
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Carly Rae Jepsen with Call Me Maybe.

1372
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:56,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandpa, you out there listening?

1373
01:43:58,269 --> 01:43:58,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1374
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:59,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this.

1375
01:44:00,132 --> 01:44:02,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Army of Lovers with Crucified.

1376
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:32,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song YouTube that video immediately it is fucking amazing and I cannot stress how great it is over a radio show but you don't understand how awesome it is that that song is in this game until you YouTube the video seriously do it after OLR Army of Lovers Crucified it's in Just Dance 4 they definitely have an eclectic mix they really do they really do Rihanna with Disturbia something new let's see they might be Giants Istanbul

1377
01:44:32,924 --> 01:44:33,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.

1378
01:44:33,504 --> 01:44:34,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in DDR once.

1379
01:44:34,924 --> 01:44:35,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's Ultimix 3.

1380
01:44:36,145 --> 01:44:37,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Elvis Presley with Jailhouse Rock.

1381
01:44:38,665 --> 01:44:40,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Ricky Martin with Livin' La Vida Loco.

1382
01:44:41,026 --> 01:44:41,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

1383
01:44:41,406 --> 01:44:42,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Livin' La Vida Loco.

1384
01:44:42,706 --> 01:44:45,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Selena Gomez in the scene with Love You Like a Love Song.

1385
01:44:46,427 --> 01:44:47,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Moves Like Jagger.

1386
01:44:47,507 --> 01:44:49,347
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because every fucking game has to have moves like Jagger.

1387
01:44:50,487 --> 01:44:52,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Alexandra Stan, Mr. Saxo Beat.

1388
01:44:52,168 --> 01:44:52,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that song?

1389
01:44:53,788 --> 01:44:54,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.

1390
01:44:54,468 --> 01:44:55,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Marina and the Diamonds.

1391
01:44:55,868 --> 01:44:57,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, it's going to be in there.

1392
01:44:57,109 --> 01:44:58,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very British...

1393
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:02,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a good... It's not just eclectic, but it's eclectic like multi-regional.

1394
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:03,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you get a lot of...

1395
01:45:04,366 --> 01:45:05,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we get any J-pop?

1396
01:45:05,207 --> 01:45:06,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we, do we, do we, do we?

1397
01:45:06,628 --> 01:45:07,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that eclectic, unfortunately.

1398
01:45:07,908 --> 01:45:08,089
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1399
01:45:08,129 --> 01:45:21,557
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do get the B-52s with Rock Lobster, Pink with So What, Halloween Thrills with The Time Warp, which I do believe would be a cover of the Rocky Horror Picture Show song, which is obviously all kinds of amazing.

1400
01:45:22,498 --> 01:45:26,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Too Unlimited with Tribal Dance, as long as we're borrowing from DDR games, right?

1403
01:45:33,125 --> 01:45:33,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey.

1404
01:45:35,427 --> 01:45:37,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Will Smith with Wild Wild West.

1405
01:45:38,729 --> 01:45:41,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, that must have been a cheap license.

1406
01:45:42,991 --> 01:45:44,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's my favorite.

1407
01:45:45,813 --> 01:45:49,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Skillerex with Rock and Roll will take you to the mountain.

1408
01:45:49,735 --> 01:45:51,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you get your dubstep song.

1409
01:45:51,276 --> 01:45:53,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never heard that song, and I never plan on it.

1410
01:45:53,958 --> 01:45:55,819
[SPEAKER_06]: No, do not poison my brain.

1411
01:45:55,899 --> 01:45:56,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I am kind of curious.

1412
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:58,981
[SPEAKER_06]: With shitty dubstep.

1413
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:00,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate dubstep.

1414
01:46:00,381 --> 01:46:01,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Not all dubstep's shitty.

1415
01:46:01,562 --> 01:46:01,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

1416
01:46:02,162 --> 01:46:02,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1417
01:46:05,485 --> 01:46:06,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say this.

1418
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:12,655
[SPEAKER_03]: We were at brunch today, and this dubstep song, this obvious dubstep song was playing on the speaker.

1419
01:46:12,675 --> 01:46:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, and I was like, what in the fuck is this?

1420
01:46:18,303 --> 01:46:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alan's all, oh, it's the hot new single by Car Alarm.

1421
01:46:23,744 --> 01:46:24,424
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a car alarm.

1422
01:46:24,705 --> 01:46:24,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1423
01:46:26,645 --> 01:46:28,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if there was a group called that, just saying.

1424
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:31,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised they don't have a car alarm that's dubstep.

1425
01:46:32,627 --> 01:46:38,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I was like, can I put that in my car to scare away the... Okay, here we go, an OLR exclusive, everybody.

1426
01:46:39,049 --> 01:46:41,709
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura gets introduced to dubstep.

1427
01:46:41,949 --> 01:46:42,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1428
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:44,110
[SPEAKER_03]: No, take your fingers out of your ear.

1429
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,711
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for science, DarkSakura, for science.

1430
01:46:46,811 --> 01:46:47,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1431
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:03,030
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I can't let too much of this play.

1432
01:47:03,970 --> 01:47:06,271
[SPEAKER_03]: I can let a little bit of it play for the purposes of commentary.

1433
01:47:06,511 --> 01:47:09,172
[SPEAKER_03]: But DarkSakura, thoughts on Rock and Roll Will Take You to the Mountain?

1434
01:47:09,573 --> 01:47:10,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to quote Becky.

1435
01:47:11,693 --> 01:47:13,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That sort of cruelty will not be tolerated.

1436
01:47:13,494 --> 01:47:18,976
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of like that song, actually.

1437
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:20,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1438
01:47:21,277 --> 01:47:24,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't he use that same little, oh my god, riff in another song?

1439
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:25,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure he does.

1440
01:47:25,319 --> 01:47:25,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he does.

1441
01:47:32,872 --> 01:47:36,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather listen to Sarah Brightman.

1442
01:47:37,553 --> 01:47:38,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know how I feel about Sarah Brightman.

1443
01:47:38,814 --> 01:47:40,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Sarah Brightman, though.

1444
01:47:41,255 --> 01:47:44,996
[SPEAKER_03]: She knows how to bring the... I can't... Never mind.

1445
01:47:45,056 --> 01:47:48,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say the word, but she knows how to bring it.

1446
01:47:49,298 --> 01:47:50,219
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1447
01:48:18,872 --> 01:48:40,947
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf says the dubstep song we have in rotation is okay, the Skyrim to the knee SSJ100Matt says that's pretty good That's how she was a sitting vampire actually said It always reminds me of downtown Julie Brown Speaking of dubstep, have you seen the new trailer for Borderlands 2?

1448
01:48:41,627 --> 01:48:43,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fucking fantastic

1449
01:48:43,689 --> 01:48:44,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is it all dubstep?

1450
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:45,731
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not all dubstep.

1451
01:48:46,051 --> 01:48:50,274
[SPEAKER_11]: They reminded me of it because, you know, they had the first trailer they were making fun of the dubstep trailers.

1452
01:48:50,854 --> 01:48:55,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, of course, they have, you know, Claptrap doing dubstep stuff.

1453
01:48:55,878 --> 01:48:57,740
[SPEAKER_11]: But, no, the new trailer is fucking awesome.

1454
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got, you know, the villain basically at the end is like, come and get me.

1455
01:49:01,362 --> 01:49:03,984
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, yeah, I want to fucking kill that guy.

1456
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:07,247
[SPEAKER_11]: And does it have that same music, that wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, wop?

1457
01:49:07,267 --> 01:49:08,287
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1458
01:49:08,328 --> 01:49:11,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember it had that, but it's got some sort of electronica in there.

1459
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Exciting, exciting radio.

1460
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:14,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1461
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:15,100
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting for me.

1462
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:15,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they not have it?

1463
01:49:15,621 --> 01:49:16,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is it.

1464
01:49:16,561 --> 01:49:17,101
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks live.

1465
01:49:17,121 --> 01:49:18,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know if you like this.

1466
01:49:18,201 --> 01:49:19,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me try to feel this vibration.

1467
01:49:42,738 --> 01:49:46,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is she spasming?

1468
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:50,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Or doing like some stupid interpretive dance?

1469
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:51,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that song.

1470
01:49:52,061 --> 01:49:53,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't like her voice.

1471
01:49:55,763 --> 01:50:00,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course she's being all like Jesus-y with her hands up and being carried by her disciples.

1472
01:50:01,005 --> 01:50:02,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't care for her voice that much.

1473
01:50:03,525 --> 01:50:05,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I thought that she was good in Repo.

1474
01:50:06,086 --> 01:50:06,627
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

1475
01:50:07,547 --> 01:50:09,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because she rips her eyes out.

1476
01:50:09,648 --> 01:50:10,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

1477
01:50:15,123 --> 01:50:17,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight is like the Discover New Music on OLR night.

1478
01:50:17,885 --> 01:50:18,925
[SPEAKER_11]: She rips her eyes out.

1479
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:24,028
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be a good animated gif for something, like bad YouTube videos or something.

1480
01:50:25,629 --> 01:50:27,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised I haven't seen that gif on OLR.

1481
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:27,630
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they didn't.

1482
01:50:29,731 --> 01:50:31,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd rather be blind.

1483
01:50:33,093 --> 01:50:35,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to spoil Repo, the lunatic opera, but it's a great movie.

1484
01:50:36,615 --> 01:50:40,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's freaking, my man is in it.

1485
01:50:41,081 --> 01:50:42,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Anthony Stewart Head.

1486
01:50:42,342 --> 01:50:42,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1487
01:50:43,962 --> 01:50:45,463
[SPEAKER_06]: He can be my uncle.

1488
01:50:45,743 --> 01:50:48,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, I have my special family with Betty White as my grandmother.

1489
01:50:50,205 --> 01:50:51,405
[SPEAKER_06]: George Takei is my gay daddy.

1490
01:50:53,946 --> 01:50:55,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't decided who my other gay daddy is.

1491
01:50:58,268 --> 01:50:58,648
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1492
01:50:59,389 --> 01:51:02,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with more rapid fire news.

1493
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:04,071
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

1494
01:51:05,391 --> 01:51:12,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've got a fan project that's called Mega Man Day in the Limelight 2.

1495
01:51:12,256 --> 01:51:13,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it's apparently a sequel.

1496
01:51:14,297 --> 01:51:16,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done by the people that did Mushroom Kingdom Fusion.

1497
01:51:16,759 --> 01:51:20,522
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a rearranged version of Mega Man 3, but instead of playing what?

1498
01:51:22,763 --> 01:51:26,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Tiger Claw says, searching for car alarm dubstep, I found this.

1499
01:51:27,327 --> 01:51:27,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I...

1500
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

1501
01:51:37,501 --> 01:51:40,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

1502
01:51:47,447 --> 01:51:51,770
[SPEAKER_06]: You just made me drop my mic.

1503
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:53,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1504
01:51:54,411 --> 01:51:59,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, you play through the stages of Mega Man 3, but you play as the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.

1505
01:52:00,395 --> 01:52:03,837
[SPEAKER_06]: So it looks like it's pretty fun, and I think I'm going to be grabbing this.

1506
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:34,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck Rob No thank you, let's not fuck Rob The hell you did to my poor brain It was the chatters, it was Tiger Claw, it's all Tiger Claw's fault Team Fortress 2, we have a new co-op mode on August 15th called Man-na-na-na-na-na-na-na with an extra N, versus Machine So it's six players against doppelgangers, so you have to fight the robot versions of them And you get incredible loot!

1507
01:52:38,032 --> 01:52:39,472
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as cool as VOG loot.

1508
01:52:40,113 --> 01:52:40,293
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1509
01:52:41,393 --> 01:52:43,693
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, last but never least, Steam.

1510
01:52:44,114 --> 01:52:47,514
[SPEAKER_06]: The big picture mode is going to launch in beta in September.

1511
01:52:47,935 --> 01:52:50,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can basically play Steam on your TV.

1512
01:52:51,596 --> 01:52:51,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

1513
01:52:52,176 --> 01:52:53,956
[SPEAKER_06]: But not a Valve console.

1514
01:52:55,016 --> 01:52:55,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

1515
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:56,277
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

1516
01:52:57,177 --> 01:52:57,537
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1517
01:52:57,597 --> 01:53:00,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to the Fugo question of the week.

1518
01:53:08,195 --> 01:53:10,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Put Facebook and Google Plus together and you get Foogle.

1519
01:53:11,782 --> 01:53:14,607
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask a question every week of our... It's like they'd be their bastard love child.

1520
01:53:17,009 --> 01:53:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: We go to our fan communities every week to ask a question and share some of the answers with you guys here on the show.

1521
01:53:22,234 --> 01:53:23,755
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of answers tonight.

1522
01:53:23,815 --> 01:53:25,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't read them all, but it's a fun question.

1523
01:53:26,457 --> 01:53:27,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Football question of the week.

1524
01:53:27,538 --> 01:53:28,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just saying that because I wrote it.

1525
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:30,280
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

1526
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:35,224
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 came out today and it features new Mario powers that allow you to turn lots of things into gold coins.

1527
01:53:35,645 --> 01:53:37,787
[SPEAKER_03]: This has us thinking about power-ups.

1528
01:53:38,247 --> 01:53:41,129
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your favorite power-up item from a video game?

1529
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:44,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Please provide your user... Oh, I don't have to read that part.

1530
01:53:44,332 --> 01:53:47,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what is your favorite power-up item from a video game?

1531
01:53:47,674 --> 01:53:49,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start on Google+, shall we?

1532
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:55,038
[SPEAKER_03]: With Monster B. My favorite power-up is Adrenaline Pills from Unreal Tournament 2003-2004.

1533
01:53:55,078 --> 01:53:57,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you read this post with your Count Chocula voice?

1534
01:53:57,220 --> 01:53:57,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1535
01:54:03,383 --> 01:54:07,205
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite power-up is Adrenaline Pills from Unreal Tournament 2003.

1536
01:54:07,465 --> 01:54:09,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound more like The Count.

1537
01:54:10,406 --> 01:54:10,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Close enough.

1538
01:54:11,467 --> 01:54:13,508
[SPEAKER_03]: One, one close.

1539
01:54:13,828 --> 01:54:15,709
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all the same.

1540
01:54:15,729 --> 01:54:15,709
2003, 2004.

1541
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:22,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Flaco Jones says the Spread Gum power-up from Contra.

1542
01:54:22,732 --> 01:54:23,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Good pick.

1543
01:54:24,393 --> 01:54:30,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Redertainment says, as I remember there's an accessory in Borderlands that allows you to make a sniper rifle that sets enemies on fire.

1544
01:54:31,462 --> 01:54:35,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing people flare up and run around from a great distance always put a smile on my face.

1545
01:54:37,850 --> 01:54:39,953
[SPEAKER_03]: You and DarkSakura have some things in common, right?

1546
01:54:43,546 --> 01:54:44,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move over to Facebook.

1547
01:54:44,707 --> 01:54:46,128
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of answers on Facebook.

1548
01:54:46,168 --> 01:54:48,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to be able to read all these, but I'll read some of them.

1549
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:53,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob himself says the red shell in Mario Kart unless it's aimed at me.

1550
01:54:55,234 --> 01:54:55,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1551
01:54:56,915 --> 01:55:03,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben R says the mushroom in Mario Kart where you can just jam the item button as much as possible for a certain amount of seconds and keep boosting.

1552
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:04,660
[SPEAKER_03]: The golden mushroom.

1553
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:11,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt J says, I always loved the grappling hook from Super Metroid and later in Metroid Prime.

1554
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:15,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt like a total badass swinging back and forth on those hooks.

1555
01:55:15,696 --> 01:55:20,660
[SPEAKER_03]: The space jump comes in as a close second though, mostly because of the animation looking cool.

1556
01:55:22,001 --> 01:55:26,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Nick M says, the gravity gun from Half-Life 2 was amazing.

1557
01:55:26,524 --> 01:55:27,185
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

1558
01:55:27,865 --> 01:55:32,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya says, gotta give it to the purple tracer laser from Raiden 2.

1559
01:55:33,669 --> 01:55:34,330
[SPEAKER_06]: That, yes.

1560
01:55:35,915 --> 01:55:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Gamer Girl says, The Red Heart Potions from Legend of Zelda.

1561
01:55:39,877 --> 01:55:42,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked says, The P-Wing from Super Mario Bros.

1562
01:55:42,898 --> 01:55:42,538
3.

1563
01:55:43,278 --> 01:55:45,619
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as I loved Kuriboh's shoe and the Hammer Bros.

1564
01:55:45,659 --> 01:55:51,101
[SPEAKER_03]: suit, I don't think I've ever cleared World 8 without at least three P-Wings in the inventory.

1565
01:55:51,481 --> 01:55:55,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Infinite flight is a necessity, especially during the fast-scrolling airship stage.

1566
01:55:56,183 --> 01:55:58,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet Tag simply says, Falcon Punch.

1567
01:55:59,622 --> 01:56:04,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Benny L says, adult magazine from the God Hand that replenishes your God Hand meter.

1568
01:56:05,747 --> 01:56:06,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1569
01:56:07,108 --> 01:56:17,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Picaruno says, the hammer in Super Smash Brothers, the combination of silly music, ridiculous damage, and sheer oh fuck factor from anyone unlucky enough to be hit by it makes me giggle every time.

1570
01:56:18,296 --> 01:56:21,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim H says, monster potion from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

1571
01:56:22,039 --> 01:56:26,762
[SPEAKER_03]: You could punch holes in fences and hedges and walls and kill lumberjacks with ease.

1572
01:56:28,664 --> 01:56:35,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Austin W says, in the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask, I love the final mask in the game that turns you into fierce DD Link.

1573
01:56:35,648 --> 01:56:38,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still waiting for this character to make an appearance in the Smash games.

1574
01:56:38,770 --> 01:56:39,711
[SPEAKER_03]: That and Wolf Link.

1575
01:56:40,612 --> 01:56:43,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Charger says, Heavy Barrel from Heavy Barrel Arcade.

1576
01:56:43,754 --> 01:56:46,796
[SPEAKER_03]: In the game, you must collect and assemble all the pieces of the Heavy Barrel weapon.

1577
01:56:47,636 --> 01:56:55,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And Haseo Sumirogarwa says, if I were to choose one, it would have to be the chainsaw you get from a torture kill on Bayonetta.

1578
01:56:56,522 --> 01:56:57,402
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some good answers?

1579
01:56:57,982 --> 01:56:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you guys in the studio?

1580
01:56:59,183 --> 01:57:01,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Favorite power-up in a video game?

1581
01:57:01,323 --> 01:57:01,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a few.

1582
01:57:02,344 --> 01:57:02,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1583
01:57:02,664 --> 01:57:04,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do like Kuriboh's shoe.

1584
01:57:04,424 --> 01:57:05,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to use it through the whole damn game.

1585
01:57:06,085 --> 01:57:06,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

1586
01:57:06,365 --> 01:57:06,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Mariko.

1587
01:57:07,665 --> 01:57:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: My kitty came out.

1588
01:57:09,166 --> 01:57:10,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan's kitty, but my adopted kitty.

1589
01:57:11,226 --> 01:57:14,207
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been my recent favorite.

1590
01:57:14,647 --> 01:57:16,288
[SPEAKER_06]: The collector laser rifle.

1591
01:57:17,228 --> 01:57:17,468
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura,

1592
01:57:35,766 --> 01:57:55,797
[SPEAKER_06]: there was um oh and the issue of Fornax um as far as others that I really really like um I like the bells in Parodius that I like the word blaster where I have no idea what it's saying I can only read like some of it but it's like I don't know what you're saying but die

1593
01:57:56,858 --> 01:57:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the Proteus power-ups a whole bunch.

1594
01:58:04,501 --> 01:58:07,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Cotton, where she gets the willow.

1595
01:58:07,902 --> 01:58:09,603
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes, Weedle!

1596
01:58:09,703 --> 01:58:10,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like it because that's all she says.

1597
01:58:12,584 --> 01:58:12,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1598
01:58:14,744 --> 01:58:15,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there's a few.

1599
01:58:15,945 --> 01:58:18,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I have some actually from games I haven't played.

1600
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:19,690
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple from Red Faction.

1601
01:58:19,730 --> 01:58:24,255
[SPEAKER_11]: They had Mr. Toots, which was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of its ass.

1602
01:58:24,735 --> 01:58:25,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Amazing.

1603
01:58:25,436 --> 01:58:26,617
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a weapon in the game.

1604
01:58:27,038 --> 01:58:30,662
[SPEAKER_06]: That showed up in videos online too, right?

1605
01:58:30,973 --> 01:58:31,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuzzy from Super Mario World 2

1606
01:58:47,606 --> 01:58:49,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't really a power-up, but that's a good answer.

1607
01:58:49,848 --> 01:58:50,769
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good answer.

1608
01:58:50,809 --> 01:58:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1609
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:52,190
[SPEAKER_03]: It's memorable.

1610
01:58:52,430 --> 01:59:08,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, actually, sort of a power-up from... It was actually in a bunch of Capcom games, but one I remember was Captain Commando, where you would hop into the mechs and punch and blow things up and catch things on fire.

1611
01:59:09,065 --> 01:59:14,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember how all the old Capcom games had that little symbol that, like, showed up in every game that was always, like, an uber power-up?

1612
01:59:14,930 --> 01:59:15,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it was in every game.

1613
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:16,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what it was called.

1614
01:59:16,832 --> 01:59:17,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?

1615
01:59:17,593 --> 01:59:18,253
[SPEAKER_03]: That little symbol?

1616
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:27,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a little... I do also, though, have to second the purple laser in Raiden because that's always what I use was the purple laser.

1617
01:59:28,142 --> 01:59:28,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Loki?

1618
01:59:28,683 --> 01:59:28,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1619
01:59:29,212 --> 01:59:29,572
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1620
01:59:29,832 --> 01:59:31,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there's one more I can add, actually.

1621
01:59:32,133 --> 01:59:43,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Your shield thing in R-Type, the added-on option that you could shoot either from your butt or from the front, that was always a cool thing.

1622
01:59:44,595 --> 01:59:46,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go super-duper old school.

1623
01:59:46,716 --> 01:59:49,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the best power-ups ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong.

1624
01:59:50,077 --> 01:59:50,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the little song...

1625
01:59:53,352 --> 01:59:56,194
[SPEAKER_03]: The little animation of the hammer going up and down was really funny to me.

1626
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:58,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always loved the hammer in the original Donkey Kong.

1627
01:59:59,175 --> 02:00:04,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the pow brick in Mario Brothers because I love... I'm not talking Super Mario Brothers.

1628
02:00:04,458 --> 02:00:05,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking old school Mario Brothers.

1629
02:00:05,638 --> 02:00:06,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved that game.

1630
02:00:06,499 --> 02:00:06,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I still do.

1631
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,921
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my favorite... You knock everyone on their ass.

1632
02:00:09,961 --> 02:00:12,042
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my... Yeah, you just knock everyone on their ass.

1633
02:00:12,082 --> 02:00:14,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is cool that the pow bricks kind of come back in the later Mario games.

1634
02:00:14,943 --> 02:00:15,744
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be awesome.

1635
02:00:16,804 --> 02:00:19,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Smash Brothers of Old Retro Arcade Games Ripple Gun from Life Force

1636
02:00:32,654 --> 02:00:34,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that was the best one.

1637
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:35,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that power-up.

1638
02:00:35,696 --> 02:00:39,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, sometimes, even though it wasn't that great of a gun, like, I would get it just because it's cool.

1639
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:40,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I'm Team Laser over here.

1640
02:00:40,919 --> 02:00:41,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1641
02:00:41,659 --> 02:00:44,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Laser was the more effective power-up, but the Ripple was just cool.

1642
02:00:45,301 --> 02:00:51,165
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think the best power-up, like, ever were the options in the Gradius games and any of those games.

1643
02:00:51,185 --> 02:00:51,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Option.

1644
02:00:51,565 --> 02:00:51,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Option.

1645
02:00:52,306 --> 02:00:52,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1646
02:00:52,466 --> 02:00:53,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe those are great power-ups.

1647
02:00:53,526 --> 02:00:55,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Or too much speed-up, though, and you'd be dead.

1648
02:00:55,988 --> 02:00:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1649
02:00:56,588 --> 02:01:07,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, well, another one, actually, since I mentioned R-Type is the, um, I don't know if it's called the Ripple Gun in R-Type, but it's like a dual red and blue that forms this big, uh, swirl as it goes across.

1650
02:01:07,778 --> 02:01:08,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a wave gun or something?

1651
02:01:08,699 --> 02:01:11,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some kind of wave gun, but I just thought that one was pretty.

1652
02:01:11,421 --> 02:01:13,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Chiggers in our chatroom says a Suriken?

1653
02:01:13,763 --> 02:01:16,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that was the name of it, that thing I'm trying to think of.

1654
02:01:16,926 --> 02:01:17,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Where...

1655
02:01:18,036 --> 02:01:41,083
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that Capcom thing that was in the like it was in 1942 and it was in Bionic Commando and which um um one other one I would name power up that was awesome you know I'm gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm gonna say the very end of the game when you have that laser that just blows through everything like the rainbow laser that just cuts through everything there was just something really epic about that moment when you had that beam as you were fighting Mother Brain

1656
02:01:41,603 --> 02:01:42,164
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1657
02:01:42,344 --> 02:01:44,145
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one other thing I know.

1658
02:01:44,645 --> 02:01:48,647
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game I've actually covered for Classic Game that's Star Parodia.

1659
02:01:49,308 --> 02:01:51,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I love shooting things with hue cards.

1660
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:52,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't help it.

1661
02:01:53,010 --> 02:01:54,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this answer in the chat room.

1662
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:57,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Buster says, Michael Jackson turning into a robot in Moonwalker.

1663
02:01:58,033 --> 02:01:59,534
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty awesome, actually.

1664
02:01:59,934 --> 02:02:00,775
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1665
02:02:00,975 --> 02:02:02,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, DarkTestSuya.

[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, that's it for Fugle Question of the Week.

1688
02:02:56,592 --> 02:02:58,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with some more news.

1689
02:02:58,574 --> 02:03:02,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get to the mailbag, FUs, Twitter topics, Skype, all that good stuff in just a little bit.

1690
02:03:02,716 --> 02:03:03,917
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Loki.

1691
02:03:04,237 --> 02:03:06,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, Valve is getting into all sorts of crazy shit.

1692
02:03:07,759 --> 02:03:12,101
[SPEAKER_11]: First, they have their game service, and then now they're putting other software.

1693
02:03:12,622 --> 02:03:15,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're making documentaries.

1694
02:03:16,144 --> 02:03:19,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Valve has documentaries that are...

1695
02:03:20,606 --> 02:03:21,807
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1696
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:45,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense things are going this way when that whole indie game, the movie, I'm assuming it did fairly well on Steam.

1697
02:03:45,733 --> 02:03:46,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw people talking about it.

1698
02:03:48,197 --> 02:03:54,627
[SPEAKER_06]: They did sort of have a documentary in iPad form with Portal 2, The Final Days.

1699
02:03:54,967 --> 02:03:57,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, wasn't that like a contracted thing though?

1700
02:03:58,030 --> 02:03:58,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1701
02:03:58,411 --> 02:04:01,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like Jeff Keighley put that all together, or at least supervised it.

1702
02:04:01,754 --> 02:04:05,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he didn't do it all himself, but you know, supervised that whole thing.

1703
02:04:05,638 --> 02:04:12,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because they did the portal, but wasn't there one that was the last days of... There was another game that had one.

1704
02:04:12,785 --> 02:04:13,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it another Valve game?

1705
02:04:15,487 --> 02:04:17,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, didn't they do one for Mass Effect 3?

1706
02:04:18,171 --> 02:04:18,611
[SPEAKER_03]: They did.

1707
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:22,294
[SPEAKER_03]: They did do The Last Days of Mass Effect 3 and The Last Days of Portal.

1708
02:04:22,334 --> 02:04:22,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care.

1709
02:04:22,775 --> 02:04:25,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to see an animated Team Fortress 2 movie.

1710
02:04:25,777 --> 02:04:27,438
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be fucking amazing.

1711
02:04:27,478 --> 02:04:28,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Fans can make them now.

1712
02:04:28,799 --> 02:04:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I understand that.

1713
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And then market them through Steam.

1714
02:04:31,081 --> 02:04:31,741
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be crazy.

1715
02:04:32,482 --> 02:04:38,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I still want to see a... Let's see a future-length animated movie because their shit's pretty awesome.

1716
02:04:38,206 --> 02:04:39,367
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Wreck-It Ralph coming.

1717
02:04:40,428 --> 02:04:42,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt Team Fortress characters are in it, but...

1718
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:44,070
[SPEAKER_11]: They should be.

1719
02:04:45,571 --> 02:04:46,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1720
02:04:46,891 --> 02:04:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on to Nintendo.

1721
02:04:48,411 --> 02:04:54,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I referenced this a little bit earlier in the show, but I wanted to go into depth on this a little bit because I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on this.

1722
02:04:55,052 --> 02:05:01,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo is promising that their DLC will not leave users feel cheated or deceived.

1723
02:05:01,474 --> 02:05:08,455
[SPEAKER_03]: This is according to Satoru Iwata, who of course is the president of Nintendo, because you know Nintendo is just now getting into DLC.

1724
02:05:10,356 --> 02:05:13,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 2012, and DLC's been prevalent since what, about 06, 07?

1725
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:21,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're just now getting the HD, too, so I mean... Nintendo's finally getting into DLC, and here's what they said.

1726
02:05:22,328 --> 02:05:31,958
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing Nintendo has determined as a company policy, what we are not going to do is create a full game and then say, let's hold this back for DLC.

1727
02:05:32,799 --> 02:05:33,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all a matter of opinion

1728
02:05:51,049 --> 02:05:58,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Capcom, I'm sure, in their defense, would say that Street Fighter X Tekken was a full game and that these additional characters are, you know, just that.

1729
02:05:58,918 --> 02:05:59,598
[SPEAKER_11]: They're additional.

1730
02:05:59,638 --> 02:06:01,721
[SPEAKER_03]: But the rest of the internet called them out on that bullshit.

1731
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:03,382
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, it's on disc.

1732
02:06:03,663 --> 02:06:04,864
[SPEAKER_11]: It's paid to unlock content.

1733
02:06:04,924 --> 02:06:07,447
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's even, like, there's one story I didn't talk about.

1734
02:06:07,547 --> 02:06:08,708
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Sleeping Dogs.

1735
02:06:08,988 --> 02:06:11,091
[SPEAKER_11]: How they, oh, yeah, we have six months planned of DLC.

1736
02:06:11,151 --> 02:06:12,232
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all paid to unlock stuff.

1737
02:06:12,652 --> 02:06:16,895
[SPEAKER_11]: To be fair, that is a game where you don't really need that stuff.

1738
02:06:16,975 --> 02:06:17,935
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just costumes.

1739
02:06:18,796 --> 02:06:20,096
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there's any additional missions.

1740
02:06:20,116 --> 02:06:22,398
[SPEAKER_11]: There may be, but it's mostly costumes.

1741
02:06:22,818 --> 02:06:23,919
[SPEAKER_03]: One quick other statement here.

1742
02:06:24,299 --> 02:06:28,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is to create DLC in such a way that consumers do not feel they have been cheated or deceived.

1743
02:06:29,462 --> 02:06:33,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there are people out there, readers, who are worried about that.

1744
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:34,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a weird translation there.

1745
02:06:35,365 --> 02:06:40,548
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to ensure them that we have in mind and want them to know that that's not what we are planning on doing.

1746
02:06:42,153 --> 02:06:42,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nintendo?

1747
02:06:42,953 --> 02:06:44,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Planning and doing are two different things.

1748
02:06:46,555 --> 02:07:00,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not planning on doing it, but... Well, you know, it's not just Iwata that said this because I remember distinctly in that 3DS little press conference thing, not the one from E3, but the one that came out a little later where they spotlighted the games again.

1749
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:03,961
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one of those Nintendo Direct things that had Reggie and some of those guys.

1750
02:07:04,361 --> 02:07:05,142
[SPEAKER_03]: for Nintendo in it.

1751
02:07:06,223 --> 02:07:10,626
[SPEAKER_03]: He specifically said, we're going to have DLC for New Super Mario Bros.

1752
02:07:10,907 --> 02:07:14,610
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, but I want to assure everybody it's additional content.

1753
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:16,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a finished game first.

1754
02:07:16,512 --> 02:07:22,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they really went out of their way to stress it's not something that you're going to have to have.

1755
02:07:23,037 --> 02:07:25,780
[SPEAKER_03]: It is truly something extra the designers are working on.

1756
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,141
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1757
02:07:29,303 --> 02:07:30,704
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think, Nintendo DLC?

1758
02:07:31,704 --> 02:07:34,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really know what the thing is yet because we haven't seen any examples yet.

1759
02:07:36,129 --> 02:07:36,990
[SPEAKER_03]: New Super Mario Bros.

1760
02:07:37,010 --> 02:07:39,833
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 is going to be the first example of first-party DLC anyway.

1761
02:07:41,034 --> 02:07:50,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know if it's going to... I mean, I would be... I was always hoping that, like, you know, Excite Truck, you know, hey, all we need is DLC with new levels.

1762
02:07:50,465 --> 02:07:50,865
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1763
02:07:50,945 --> 02:07:53,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Just add new levels and I'll be happy.

1764
02:07:54,718 --> 02:07:55,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1765
02:08:16,252 --> 02:08:21,358
[SPEAKER_11]: This old Mario Kart level is in 3D now, or it's in the polygons and stuff.

1766
02:08:21,979 --> 02:08:23,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's getting a little old.

1767
02:08:24,142 --> 02:08:25,383
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting a little tiresome.

1768
02:08:26,725 --> 02:08:29,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe do a Mario Kart game that didn't have the old tracks in it.

1769
02:08:30,816 --> 02:08:31,276
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1770
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:57,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo were to put out five new tracks, like a new circuit of five new tracks, what would that be worth to you as DLC?

1771
02:08:57,498 --> 02:08:58,218
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you pay for that?

1772
02:08:58,278 --> 02:08:58,999
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on what circuit.

1773
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:00,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if it's old re-release stuff.

1774
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:00,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say all new.

1775
02:09:00,861 --> 02:09:01,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say it's all new.

1776
02:09:03,164 --> 02:09:04,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say like five bucks.

1777
02:09:04,405 --> 02:09:04,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1778
02:09:05,026 --> 02:09:05,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1779
02:09:05,466 --> 02:09:06,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99.

1780
02:09:06,527 --> 02:09:07,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just a cheapskate.

1781
02:09:07,428 --> 02:09:10,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if you have really good tracks, it would all depend.

1782
02:09:10,531 --> 02:09:11,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know.

1783
02:09:11,885 --> 02:09:16,367
[SPEAKER_03]: or Mario 2 Coin Rush levels, three stages, back to back.

1784
02:09:16,387 --> 02:09:17,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't buy any of that.

1785
02:09:17,608 --> 02:09:18,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1786
02:09:18,228 --> 02:09:19,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about the price.

1787
02:09:19,949 --> 02:09:21,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Nintendo going to get the price right?

1788
02:09:22,150 --> 02:09:22,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1789
02:09:24,471 --> 02:09:24,851
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1790
02:09:27,308 --> 02:09:54,035
[SPEAKER_11]: uh chiggers in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says mario kart level editor and share please but then they wouldn't be able to charge you for dlc if they do that they have a mario kart level editor now on the wii and there is some not official though is it no but there's some way you can do it with sd cards where you can load custom tracks on there same with um the 3ds or not the 3ds the uh uh was it new super mario rose on the wii same thing with that you can do custom levels in that somehow

1791
02:09:54,443 --> 02:10:01,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say this, though, because some people say, well, if Mario Kart added that in, then they wouldn't be able to sell DLC.

1792
02:10:01,467 --> 02:10:02,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily the case.

1793
02:10:02,428 --> 02:10:03,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at something like LittleBigPlanet.

1794
02:10:03,668 --> 02:10:04,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It does this very well.

1795
02:10:04,789 --> 02:10:06,050
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet does great DLC.

1796
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:06,930
[SPEAKER_11]: That reminds me.

1797
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:10,272
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a ROM hack for New Super Mario Bros.

1798
02:10:10,512 --> 02:10:12,433
[SPEAKER_11]: on the DS that was New Super Mario Bros.

1799
02:10:12,793 --> 02:10:15,235
[SPEAKER_11]: 3, and it had a lot of really cool levels and stuff in it.

1800
02:10:15,875 --> 02:10:18,356
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be kind of cool to compare that to New Super Mario Bros.

1801
02:10:18,376 --> 02:10:18,537
[SPEAKER_11]: 2 now.

1802
02:10:19,737 --> 02:10:26,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see how better one is than the other.

1803
02:10:26,999 --> 02:10:30,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think that one had some really unique ideas that they did with it.

1804
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:33,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if we're going to see that in the level design.

1805
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if a lot of those people are thinking that far outside the box like some of the ROM hackers do.

1806
02:10:39,641 --> 02:10:40,501
[SPEAKER_03]: We shall see.

1807
02:10:41,321 --> 02:10:42,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on for now.

1808
02:10:42,442 --> 02:10:44,442
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura with some more news.

1809
02:10:45,310 --> 02:10:48,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do have something else from Valve.

1810
02:10:50,351 --> 02:10:53,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the Perpetual Testing Initiative.

1811
02:10:54,051 --> 02:10:56,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the in-game Portal 2 editor.

1812
02:10:56,612 --> 02:10:57,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a few other things.

1813
02:10:57,592 --> 02:11:07,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone's actually even gone and tried to recreate the entire first portal using nothing but, at least the puzzles and everything, using nothing but the in-game editor.

1814
02:11:08,134 --> 02:11:13,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now they have a patch that's going to be an update for that to let you do co-op...

1815
02:11:14,955 --> 02:11:24,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-op Test Chambers and you also have another option that's a quick play feature so that you can see the top rated user maps for each category.

1816
02:11:25,444 --> 02:11:33,991
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I said free and it's also going to come with a 75% off Portal 2 voucher so that you can share the game with a friend.

1817
02:11:35,412 --> 02:11:36,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Not bad, huh?

1818
02:11:37,274 --> 02:11:37,995
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not bad at all.

1819
02:11:38,095 --> 02:11:38,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you Steam.

1820
02:11:38,875 --> 02:11:39,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you!

1821
02:11:41,511 --> 02:11:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can get a friend Portal 2, whether they want it or not.

1822
02:11:46,274 --> 02:11:46,735
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it.

1823
02:11:47,615 --> 02:11:47,996
[SPEAKER_11]: They want it.

1824
02:11:48,076 --> 02:11:49,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wouldn't want Portal 2?

1825
02:11:49,136 --> 02:11:49,577
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

1826
02:11:49,777 --> 02:11:51,278
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think everybody should have it by now.

1827
02:11:52,138 --> 02:11:53,459
[SPEAKER_03]: With all them Steam sales and stuff.

1828
02:11:53,479 --> 02:11:54,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

1829
02:11:56,075 --> 02:11:57,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is kind of shocking.

1830
02:11:57,476 --> 02:12:04,599
[SPEAKER_11]: During Gamescom, apparently, some early builds of the game Divinity were stolen out of the booth.

1831
02:12:04,919 --> 02:12:11,942
[SPEAKER_11]: They literally picked up PCs and ran out of the building and somehow didn't get caught.

1832
02:12:13,837 --> 02:12:15,178
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a sick trend.

1833
02:12:15,518 --> 02:12:16,559
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that even happen?

1834
02:12:16,819 --> 02:12:18,700
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard about this happening at PAX and everything.

1835
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:20,661
[SPEAKER_03]: It's chaos.

1836
02:12:20,921 --> 02:12:30,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I could see if it was, for whatever reason, on a disc or something, popping the disc out, pointing it in your pocket, and running out of the... Well, something like that happened at the last PAX, didn't it?

1837
02:12:30,446 --> 02:12:31,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we report on that?

1838
02:12:31,487 --> 02:12:36,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Or somebody had copied it to a USB drive or something and ran out with it?

1839
02:12:36,089 --> 02:12:39,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was... I forget what game it was, but yeah, I do remember that.

1840
02:12:41,511 --> 02:13:08,680
[SPEAKER_11]: but anyways so apparently the two games Divinity Dragon Commander and Divinity Original Sin have been stolen from Larian Studios and they've actually posted a reward of $5,000 for anybody that can you know point fingers at who took them it was Breach was the game that was stolen at PAX oh I'm sorry yeah

1841
02:13:11,314 --> 02:13:11,974
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just weird.

1842
02:13:12,274 --> 02:13:12,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm surprised.

1843
02:13:14,675 --> 02:13:19,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, they were using backup PCs, so there's no issues with actual code being sold.

1844
02:13:19,316 --> 02:13:21,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it only makes sense you can back up that stuff.

1845
02:13:21,037 --> 02:13:23,798
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our only copy of the code that we have here.

1846
02:13:23,818 --> 02:13:25,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised.

1847
02:13:25,398 --> 02:13:25,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah, shit.

1848
02:13:26,058 --> 02:13:29,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, it's still shitty that they have to plan that.

1849
02:13:30,180 --> 02:13:33,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, backing up code machines, but it's shitty if somebody stole it in the first place.

1850
02:13:34,061 --> 02:13:34,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, come on.

1851
02:13:34,761 --> 02:13:36,081
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be on security cameras.

1852
02:13:36,101 --> 02:13:38,082
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to notice someone, you know,

1853
02:13:39,434 --> 02:13:42,975
[SPEAKER_11]: GameGuru in our chatroom with the inappropriate joke Guest appearance by Carmen Sandiego

1854
02:14:08,161 --> 02:14:08,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?

1855
02:14:08,642 --> 02:14:08,922
[SPEAKER_06]: When?

1856
02:14:09,202 --> 02:14:09,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp womp.

1857
02:14:11,945 --> 02:14:13,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

1858
02:14:13,426 --> 02:14:15,108
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story before the mailbag for you guys.

1859
02:14:15,128 --> 02:14:16,349
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also out of Gamescom.

1860
02:14:16,729 --> 02:14:19,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Something a little better than stolen things.

1861
02:14:20,032 --> 02:14:23,695
[SPEAKER_03]: A little seminar about how to pitch your indie game to Sony.

1862
02:14:23,735 --> 02:14:27,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me, this is not out of Gamescom, but close.

1863
02:14:27,939 --> 02:14:29,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another Europe convention.

1864
02:14:30,041 --> 02:14:31,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I sound like such an ignorant American right now.

1865
02:14:31,722 --> 02:14:32,282
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

1866
02:14:32,702 --> 02:14:34,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Game Developers Conference Europe.

1867
02:14:34,322 --> 02:14:36,263
[SPEAKER_03]: GDC Europe also happened last week.

1868
02:14:36,383 --> 02:14:37,183
[SPEAKER_03]: You may or may not have heard.

1869
02:14:37,583 --> 02:14:50,447
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there was a seminar by Pete Smith who is the Sony CrossDev Director of Product Development talking about basically what you should and you shouldn't do when you pitch your indie game.

1870
02:14:51,307 --> 02:14:55,068
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, quote, I'm sick of sitting through crap development pitches.

1871
02:14:55,928 --> 02:14:56,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1872
02:14:56,909 --> 02:14:58,329
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, let's play a game.

1873
02:15:00,082 --> 02:15:03,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if you can guess what would be some of the do's and some of the don'ts.

1874
02:15:04,044 --> 02:15:08,085
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to pitch your indie game, what are some of the do's and some of the don'ts?

1875
02:15:08,125 --> 02:15:08,886
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your guess?

1876
02:15:10,847 --> 02:15:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, if you haven't spoiled this for yourself already, you can play too.

1877
02:15:13,928 --> 02:15:14,508
[SPEAKER_03]: But no cheating.

1878
02:15:15,248 --> 02:15:17,889
[SPEAKER_06]: What to do when you're pitching it and what not to do?

1879
02:15:17,969 --> 02:15:21,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what would you do to pitch it and what makes a good pitch and what doesn't make a good pitch?

1880
02:15:22,557 --> 02:15:45,889
[SPEAKER_06]: well with a good pitch you want to definitely have some presentation materials like concept art something that's going to be solid you want to have something well written out spelled correctly ding ding ding we have have assets these include a one page overview screenshots or video all on a USB stick for the publisher to keep don't waste time or money on swag good

1881
02:15:46,317 --> 02:15:46,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1882
02:15:47,678 --> 02:15:58,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's nice to have something kind of neat to throw in it, but no one's going to invest any money if they don't have at least an appetizer instead of the meat and potatoes.

1883
02:15:58,443 --> 02:16:01,424
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to see what the vision is.

1884
02:16:01,444 --> 02:16:02,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have a projection.

1885
02:16:02,765 --> 02:16:12,189
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to have a financial comparison to see if there's other games of a similar genre, what they're making money with, and how this is going to compare to them.

1886
02:16:12,389 --> 02:16:13,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Financial presentation.

1887
02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:16,334
[SPEAKER_06]: What not to do is just say, oh, I've got an idea for a game.

1888
02:16:16,374 --> 02:16:16,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you give me money?

1889
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to harass them with phone calls.

1890
02:16:21,902 --> 02:16:23,425
[SPEAKER_06]: You send the first email.

1891
02:16:23,465 --> 02:16:25,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You send them the test product.

1892
02:16:25,228 --> 02:16:26,109
[SPEAKER_06]: You send a follow-up.

1893
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:27,732
[SPEAKER_06]: You wait for a response.

1894
02:16:29,265 --> 02:16:33,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really on the list per se, but I still think that's good advice.

1895
02:16:33,289 --> 02:16:34,870
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's necessarily wrong.

1896
02:16:35,971 --> 02:16:36,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar answers are there.

1897
02:16:37,012 --> 02:16:37,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, did you cheat?

1898
02:16:38,293 --> 02:16:38,693
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't cheat.

1899
02:16:38,793 --> 02:16:40,395
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what would you guess?

1900
02:16:40,495 --> 02:16:46,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Good pitch features tits and ass.

1901
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:47,301
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1902
02:16:47,421 --> 02:16:51,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I will give that credit because on the do not list is be boring.

1903
02:16:51,905 --> 02:16:54,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly that is the opposite of boring.

1904
02:16:55,248 --> 02:16:56,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Be boring is on the do not list.

1905
02:16:58,014 --> 02:17:04,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I don't think that they want, it's, try to stay away from, like, graphs and charts, maybe?

1906
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:12,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, maybe more, just quick summaries of, like, here's my story, you know, here's, you know, the concept, that type of thing?

1907
02:17:12,268 --> 02:17:14,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the opposite is true.

1908
02:17:14,451 --> 02:17:18,475
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DingDing, on the do list, keep your visuals simple and bold, basically.

1909
02:17:18,855 --> 02:17:19,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1910
02:17:19,716 --> 02:17:47,894
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so anyhow on the do list know what your game is be able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep your visuals simple and bold you don't have to you want to you want to show off gameplay not graphics exactly you want to be succinct research fuck yes don't ask them what Evita is really if you're gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what Evita is really really I have something for your Vita system

1911
02:17:49,924 --> 02:17:52,205
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a vital game for the vita.

1912
02:17:52,766 --> 02:17:56,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, there's something else that occurred to me, and I didn't look at your screen.

1913
02:17:56,768 --> 02:17:58,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen anything.

1914
02:17:58,129 --> 02:17:58,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, sure.

1915
02:17:58,909 --> 02:18:08,114
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to make sure that the person making the pitch knows how to speak in front of people, enunciate, and has a presence.

1916
02:18:08,335 --> 02:18:11,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch.

1917
02:18:11,797 --> 02:18:12,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that on there for real?

1918
02:18:12,597 --> 02:18:13,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, are both there for real.

1919
02:18:14,498 --> 02:18:16,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice your pitch and choose the right person for the pitch.

1920
02:18:17,099 --> 02:18:19,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone who can talk about the game to a room of suits with ease.

1921
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:20,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1922
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:23,601
[SPEAKER_06]: The average person does not know corporate speak.

1923
02:18:23,661 --> 02:18:23,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1924
02:18:24,401 --> 02:18:24,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1925
02:18:24,801 --> 02:18:30,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the list here, be able to adapt because some games often don't end up what they're pitched.

1926
02:18:31,443 --> 02:18:33,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Manage your expectations.

1927
02:18:33,524 --> 02:18:36,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony isn't going to back a game unless it benefits them as well as you.

1928
02:18:37,005 --> 02:18:38,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So be prepared to negotiate that IP.

1929
02:18:39,506 --> 02:19:08,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very realistic answer there let's see I think we hit on some of these others sell yourself as a company and as individuals I think that's very interesting because they say that you have to be able to work with the people not just the idea very interesting they say Media Molecule was a great example of this Sony wanted to work with the people so they followed through Media Molecule probably brought us one of the greatest Sony games ever period little big planet show passion if you don't care why will they

1930
02:19:10,202 --> 02:19:13,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Ben Stein and here's my game.

1931
02:19:13,743 --> 02:19:15,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, lastly on the do not list and then we'll move on.

1932
02:19:15,904 --> 02:19:16,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be boring.

1933
02:19:17,545 --> 02:19:20,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bitch and whine about other developers or publishers.

1934
02:19:21,307 --> 02:19:22,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's great advice.

1935
02:19:22,447 --> 02:19:25,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't burn your bridges and they just say it's a small industry.

1936
02:19:26,129 --> 02:19:26,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.

1937
02:19:27,869 --> 02:19:31,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't spend the entire time on your pitch because you want room for Q&A.

1938
02:19:31,571 --> 02:19:32,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't bullshit.

1939
02:19:37,434 --> 02:19:41,615
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's already a million bullshit terms, though, that people have used to fool the public.

1940
02:19:42,275 --> 02:19:44,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, remember blast processing?

1941
02:19:44,836 --> 02:19:45,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true, yeah.

1942
02:19:45,956 --> 02:19:46,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what all that was?

1943
02:19:47,457 --> 02:19:50,537
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the only thing that Genesis did better than the Super Nintendo.

1944
02:19:50,737 --> 02:19:51,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1945
02:19:51,978 --> 02:19:56,299
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, or, like, look at these graphics, blah, blah, blah.

1946
02:19:56,379 --> 02:19:56,939
[SPEAKER_06]: No substance.

1947
02:19:57,799 --> 02:19:59,820
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's bullshitting right there.

1948
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,880
[SPEAKER_06]: You just show them pretty... Like, what was Heavenly Sword?

1949
02:20:03,701 --> 02:20:04,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Jane, Enemy, Crabs.

1950
02:20:05,382 --> 02:20:07,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Knowit also has blast processing.

1951
02:20:08,783 --> 02:20:09,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Chipotle.

1952
02:20:12,665 --> 02:20:12,965
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1953
02:20:14,106 --> 02:20:15,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the big ones from the do not list.

1954
02:20:16,386 --> 02:20:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually on the list.

1955
02:20:18,467 --> 02:20:20,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie, you're just going to go like, really?

1956
02:20:20,728 --> 02:20:21,869
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to tell people this?

1957
02:20:21,989 --> 02:20:22,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1958
02:20:23,249 --> 02:20:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: First, do not tell the publisher how to do their job.

1959
02:20:29,452 --> 02:20:31,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell Sony why they're a bad publisher.

1960
02:20:33,373 --> 02:20:34,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be late.

1961
02:20:37,971 --> 02:20:39,491
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't you ready for the last one?

1962
02:20:39,511 --> 02:20:42,933
[SPEAKER_06]: shut up Tiger Claw, mode 7 was awesome you ready for the last one?

1963
02:20:43,633 --> 02:20:46,614
[SPEAKER_03]: don't be hungover really?

1964
02:20:49,035 --> 02:20:50,156
[SPEAKER_03]: don't be hungover really?

1965
02:20:50,396 --> 02:21:00,280
[SPEAKER_03]: because a lot of pitches are done at these types of E3, GDC, big events right after big parties don't come drunk the next day really?

1966
02:21:01,921 --> 02:21:02,261
[SPEAKER_03]: really?

1967
02:21:03,422 --> 02:21:03,962
[SPEAKER_03]: food for thought

1968
02:21:05,168 --> 02:21:13,098
[SPEAKER_03]: They suggest that you have the rest of your life to drink so that if you have a presentation the next day, maybe you just shouldn't party the night before.

1969
02:21:13,219 --> 02:21:15,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And not everyone has my mutant power to never have a hangover.

1970
02:21:16,903 --> 02:21:20,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1971
02:21:20,448 --> 02:21:23,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Dungeon Buster says, wow, those had to be on a list.

1972
02:21:25,225 --> 02:21:29,107
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw says, by the way, someone should pitch the OLR the game.

1973
02:21:29,507 --> 02:21:30,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already happening, remember?

1974
02:21:30,747 --> 02:21:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an indie game coming to the marketplace, the Bungie Ferret Tossing, which I'm told is very soon.

1975
02:21:36,009 --> 02:21:36,549
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening soon.

1976
02:21:36,589 --> 02:21:38,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally want to do a bumper.

1977
02:21:39,971 --> 02:21:41,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Play our game, damn it.

1978
02:21:42,512 --> 02:21:44,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Giovedeo wins with this comment.

1979
02:21:44,972 --> 02:21:46,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't fuck it up.

1980
02:21:48,157 --> 02:21:48,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1981
02:21:48,897 --> 02:21:51,498
[SPEAKER_03]: RuPaul's Drag Race references will always win.

1982
02:21:52,879 --> 02:21:54,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I will purchase Dio Videa's product.

1983
02:21:55,740 --> 02:21:56,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You win, ma'am.

1984
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:57,361
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1985
02:21:57,841 --> 02:21:59,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the mailbag.

1986
02:21:59,461 --> 02:22:06,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week we collect your mails is at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1987
02:22:06,744 --> 02:22:07,585
[SPEAKER_03]: There's my mailbag music.

1988
02:22:09,844 --> 02:22:17,609
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is going to put on her protective garb and dive into the mailbag headfirst and pull out some emails to reads for use.

1989
02:22:18,509 --> 02:22:19,090
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

1990
02:22:21,311 --> 02:22:22,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think your whistling is getting picked up by the mic.

1991
02:22:22,912 --> 02:22:24,673
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not, but I felt like whistling anyway.

1992
02:22:25,353 --> 02:22:26,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

1993
02:22:27,074 --> 02:22:27,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

1994
02:22:27,495 --> 02:22:29,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, enthusiastic emailer.

1995
02:22:30,497 --> 02:22:32,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm currently listening to episode 469 now live.

1996
02:22:32,418 --> 02:22:32,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1997
02:22:32,758 --> 02:22:32,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1998
02:22:37,287 --> 02:22:42,170
[SPEAKER_06]: You wrote I and, but I think you meant and I. Heard Rob request emails for codes.

1999
02:22:42,570 --> 02:22:46,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so jealous of other live listeners because I cannot F and type fast enough.

2000
02:22:46,793 --> 02:22:48,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, did you not screen the emails?

2001
02:22:48,534 --> 02:22:52,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to have those emails that are like, give me loot because we have loot to give away.

2002
02:22:52,296 --> 02:22:52,957
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm going to read it.

2003
02:22:53,137 --> 02:22:53,837
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's fine.

2004
02:22:54,297 --> 02:22:58,740
[SPEAKER_06]: If I get the code, I will find some way to get Loki to don the Tingle costume come hell or high water.

2005
02:23:00,621 --> 02:23:01,381
[SPEAKER_06]: That's from Spazinator.

2006
02:23:01,721 --> 02:23:04,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if I understand how that's going to happen.

2007
02:23:05,342 --> 02:23:06,722
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe that that was ever part of the plan.

2008
02:23:06,742 --> 02:23:07,962
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be like Loki Saw.

2009
02:23:08,122 --> 02:23:09,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Drugs or violence.

2010
02:23:09,403 --> 02:23:11,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Saw off your leg or wear a tingle.

2011
02:23:11,803 --> 02:23:12,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Live or die.

2012
02:23:13,963 --> 02:23:15,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Live or die or tingle.

2013
02:23:15,684 --> 02:23:16,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your choice.

2014
02:23:18,224 --> 02:23:19,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I miss the Saw movies.

2015
02:23:19,984 --> 02:23:20,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.

2016
02:23:20,805 --> 02:23:21,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, come on.

2017
02:23:21,405 --> 02:23:22,845
[SPEAKER_11]: What do we have now?

2018
02:23:23,005 --> 02:23:25,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Yearly paranormal activity movies?

2019
02:23:26,285 --> 02:23:27,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Silent Hill Revelations.

2020
02:23:27,886 --> 02:23:28,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I know!

2021
02:23:29,906 --> 02:23:30,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

2022
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:51,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi!

2023
02:23:51,381 --> 02:23:51,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2024
02:23:52,021 --> 02:23:53,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR peoples, this is Honey Badger.

2025
02:23:53,482 --> 02:23:56,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew Honey Badger was going to email because Honey Badger told me he was going to email.

2026
02:23:56,864 --> 02:23:57,284
[SPEAKER_06]: A.K.A.

2027
02:23:57,324 --> 02:23:58,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Blade 3, A.K.A.

2028
02:23:58,325 --> 02:23:59,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam, call me whatever.

2029
02:24:00,066 --> 02:24:03,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, I just wanted to tell a little story about a funny experience with EA.

2030
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:07,930
[SPEAKER_06]: EA has been distinguished as being the world's shittiest company.

2031
02:24:08,431 --> 02:24:10,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought two copies of the same game via Origin.

2032
02:24:11,232 --> 02:24:17,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, a friend and I were looking for a way to play Mercenaries 2 together because it was a cheap sale for it.

2033
02:24:18,196 --> 02:24:20,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it with my Origin account for me and then for him.

2034
02:24:21,259 --> 02:24:25,862
[SPEAKER_06]: But wait, Origin does not have the feature to let you gift a copy of a game.

2035
02:24:26,262 --> 02:24:28,964
[SPEAKER_06]: So I told my friend I would log in as him and buy it for him, and I did.

2036
02:24:29,485 --> 02:24:38,311
[SPEAKER_06]: My next move was contact EA to refund one of the games, and after all, I never accessed the downloaded game in any way, so why would there be a problem there?

2037
02:24:38,851 --> 02:24:39,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I pulled up EA Live Chat.

2038
02:24:40,012 --> 02:24:44,776
[SPEAKER_06]: The rep I spoke to knew about one sentence of English, so that was great.

2039
02:25:15,299 --> 02:25:18,941
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really truly only one thing I can say about all of that.

2040
02:25:23,023 --> 02:25:23,783
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more.

2041
02:25:23,923 --> 02:25:28,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say there's hostile employees at every workplace.

2042
02:25:28,545 --> 02:25:29,126
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

2043
02:25:29,246 --> 02:25:30,406
[SPEAKER_11]: This company sucks.

2044
02:25:30,606 --> 02:25:31,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate working here.

2045
02:25:32,687 --> 02:25:33,608
[SPEAKER_06]: They're always the best.

2046
02:25:34,841 --> 02:25:36,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they'll give you the most stuff because they hate their job.

2047
02:25:37,883 --> 02:25:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: A winner is you.

2048
02:25:58,988 --> 02:26:09,593
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura has me wondering if the next Playstation and Xbox will have the same controllers as the current systems or will they be redesigned?

2049
02:26:09,613 --> 02:26:11,274
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you all think?

2050
02:26:23,268 --> 02:26:24,349
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2051
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:44,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2052
02:27:01,531 --> 02:27:03,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble was so last gen.

2053
02:27:04,133 --> 02:27:04,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody need Rumble?

2054
02:27:05,353 --> 02:27:05,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

2055
02:27:06,094 --> 02:27:07,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumble was so last gen.

2056
02:27:08,315 --> 02:27:10,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridge Racer is going to use six axis.

2057
02:27:10,757 --> 02:27:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the deal.

2058
02:27:11,817 --> 02:27:12,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a pile of crap.

2059
02:27:13,058 --> 02:27:16,740
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 4, probably not going to buck the trend too much.

2060
02:27:16,901 --> 02:27:20,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would think maybe one thing they're going to try to do.

2061
02:27:21,343 --> 02:27:22,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

2062
02:27:22,284 --> 02:27:24,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just putting my little tinfoil hat.

2063
02:27:25,066 --> 02:27:28,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll kind of look like a PS3 controller, but they're going to try to push that rear touch thing.

2064
02:27:29,128 --> 02:27:29,989
[SPEAKER_03]: on those controllers.

2065
02:27:30,029 --> 02:27:33,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be a little ridiculous, but that's just what I think might happen.

2066
02:27:33,111 --> 02:27:35,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that, but I think the basic design isn't going to change.

2067
02:27:36,133 --> 02:27:38,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox will change somewhat, I think.

2068
02:27:38,274 --> 02:27:41,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the controller design changed within that first Xbox.

2069
02:27:41,936 --> 02:27:43,277
[SPEAKER_11]: The D-pad.

2070
02:27:43,717 --> 02:27:46,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the first Xbox was gigantic?

2071
02:27:46,439 --> 02:27:48,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Those gigantic Xbox controllers, and they scaled them down.

2072
02:27:49,301 --> 02:27:52,543
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Xbox 360 controller was relatively similar enough.

2073
02:27:52,883 --> 02:27:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, looking at other systems, I think Nintendo's going to have a different controller every fucking time.

2074
02:27:58,607 --> 02:28:01,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, that's the one that is radically different every time.

2075
02:28:01,768 --> 02:28:10,392
[SPEAKER_06]: The only ones that never looked really much different was the... Well, even when they brought out the top-loading NES, they had this NES-style controller, kind of.

2076
02:28:11,013 --> 02:28:13,874
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was still a basic paddle and button layout, you know.

2077
02:28:14,574 --> 02:28:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the ones that, as far as logical redesigns have gone, is if you take the Sega systems, gone from the Master System, gone to the Genesis, gone to the six-button Genesis controller, to the Saturn that had a similar controller to the Genesis, to the dual analog controller, which I will stand on this to this day, best controller ever.

2078
02:28:36,313 --> 02:28:37,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Dreamcast, Dual Analog Controller

2079
02:28:51,632 --> 02:29:12,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I mean, I think that using those examples, I think that the companies, the powers that be, except for Nintendo, have learned their lesson from making too many variables in, you know, when it comes to controller progression, and are sticking with the tried and true shape.

2080
02:29:13,631 --> 02:29:21,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I may not be the biggest Sony fan, but I have to say that the controller has always had an ergonomically comfortable shape.

2081
02:29:21,820 --> 02:29:26,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I do find it easier to hold it than I do an Xbox controller.

2082
02:29:26,745 --> 02:29:31,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I tend to like games better on Xbox, the PlayStation controller is easier to hold.

2083
02:29:31,409 --> 02:29:32,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll stick with it.

2084
02:29:33,190 --> 02:30:00,689
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing to keep in mind too before you move on to the next email is that keep in mind the next Xbox is going to be very heavy on this whole whatever the new Kinect is whatever this advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect already has happened but they want it to be more than a fad they're going to shove this thing down your throat in the next Xbox so even though yes there will be a tangible controller there has to be for the Halo games expect that Microsoft will make a big deal out of the whole

2085
02:30:01,269 --> 02:30:02,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2086
02:30:16,762 --> 02:30:27,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you're dealing with two... The bulk of gamers, at least, that have the money to afford any of this are going to be in our age group.

2087
02:30:27,728 --> 02:30:32,370
[SPEAKER_06]: People who have grown up with a controller in their hand and they've tried this before with, like, remember the U-Force?

2088
02:30:32,650 --> 02:30:33,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was crap.

2089
02:30:34,311 --> 02:30:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the Activator.

2090
02:30:36,812 --> 02:30:38,733
[SPEAKER_06]: They've tried hands-free controllers before.

2091
02:30:39,474 --> 02:30:41,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And true, the technology wasn't what it is today.

2092
02:30:41,595 --> 02:30:50,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, definitely Kinect is, I'd have to say it, but the best of it, but at the very least with Nintendo and with the Move, you've still got something tangible that you can hold.

2093
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: People like that tactile experience.

2094
02:30:53,302 --> 02:30:58,885
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you remember that thing that they were making for, so you could feel the textures of things in games?

2095
02:30:59,426 --> 02:30:59,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2096
02:30:59,806 --> 02:31:01,227
[SPEAKER_06]: That thing was kind of cool.

2097
02:31:01,287 --> 02:31:02,227
[SPEAKER_03]: The haptic stuff.

2098
02:31:02,367 --> 02:31:03,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

2099
02:31:03,748 --> 02:31:04,309
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it goes...

2100
02:31:08,426 --> 02:31:09,427
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

2101
02:31:29,743 --> 02:31:33,884
[SPEAKER_06]: But logically, take away the five-year-old laughing at everything.

2102
02:31:34,584 --> 02:31:35,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I right?

2103
02:31:35,704 --> 02:31:41,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you prefer to have something in your hand while you play, or do you like waving your hands in the air, unless you're playing Parapara?

2104
02:31:42,426 --> 02:31:44,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's acceptable if I'm playing Dance Central.

2105
02:31:45,006 --> 02:31:47,327
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the only game, and it's clones.

2106
02:31:48,007 --> 02:31:51,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Those dancing games are really the only ones that have really been a great experience.

2107
02:31:51,027 --> 02:31:54,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Dancing and even the fitness stuff, if that actually works, you know?

2108
02:31:54,148 --> 02:31:54,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

2109
02:31:54,668 --> 02:31:56,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when the fitness games work.

2110
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:57,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, I'll agree with that.

2111
02:31:57,512 --> 02:31:59,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with the Wii, you know, and all that.

2112
02:31:59,795 --> 02:32:02,699
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just bitched about this last week or the week before.

2113
02:32:02,739 --> 02:32:05,823
[SPEAKER_03]: That Disneyland Connect, I want to pick up a controller and play it.

2114
02:32:06,324 --> 02:32:06,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2115
02:32:07,405 --> 02:32:07,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Ugh.

2116
02:32:08,368 --> 02:32:36,424
[SPEAKER_06]: and especially when you're dealing it's like they're trying to retrain an entire generation of gamers they want all the newer ones coming in to have a different experience than we did where I'm sorry we're the ones with the money and there's nothing wrong with having a controller you know now the only advantage like I said I can see for having something like this is like if someone's got my you know horrific hand problems but what did I do I started playing on the consoles and started playing on my PC

2117
02:32:37,757 --> 02:32:46,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I think also that they want to get rid of the controller because a lot of elderly and older people think that controllers are too confusing and so it's like all you have to do is wave your hands.

2118
02:32:46,699 --> 02:32:47,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I can do that.

2119
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:52,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I wave my hands at random strangers all the time so I'm totally used to this.

2120
02:32:52,881 --> 02:32:55,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I wave my hand to get kids off my lawn.

2121
02:32:55,382 --> 02:32:58,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I can use this as another kind of analogy here.

2122
02:32:59,343 --> 02:33:03,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in band and Rob, you know this, you were in band.

2123
02:33:03,384 --> 02:33:04,184
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you play clarinet at?

2124
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:06,031
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2125
02:33:30,049 --> 02:33:30,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2126
02:33:54,318 --> 02:34:06,003
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the people who are worse with being coordinated, like actual dancing and everything, I can't dance for crap, but I can play a game.

2127
02:34:06,183 --> 02:34:07,924
[SPEAKER_03]: You can DDR like a son of a bitch.

2128
02:34:08,144 --> 02:34:11,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, because that has to do more with the same thing.

2129
02:34:13,786 --> 02:34:20,892
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different type of... You have your hand-eye coordination going, but you don't have something that's going to be an abstract movement.

2130
02:34:20,992 --> 02:34:23,194
[SPEAKER_06]: It has something that has a tactile response.

2131
02:34:23,915 --> 02:34:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

2132
02:34:24,936 --> 02:34:25,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

2133
02:34:26,197 --> 02:34:26,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Next email.

2134
02:34:27,638 --> 02:34:28,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot what I was saying.

2135
02:34:28,659 --> 02:34:28,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2136
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:30,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, OLR.

2137
02:34:30,841 --> 02:34:37,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to type you a small email and let you know the last week's show for... Wait for it.

2138
02:34:37,867 --> 02:34:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: 69 was awesome.

2139
02:34:39,268 --> 02:34:39,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice job.

2140
02:34:41,064 --> 02:34:45,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Also wanted to say that Shane was right about sound shapes and Rob, your review was excellent.

2141
02:34:45,967 --> 02:34:48,649
[SPEAKER_06]: It is truly a great game and a breath of fresh air for the Vita.

2142
02:34:49,310 --> 02:34:51,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I know you are an FPS fan.

2143
02:34:51,711 --> 02:34:54,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get into CSGO?

2144
02:34:54,673 --> 02:34:55,073
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

2145
02:34:55,113 --> 02:34:57,235
[SPEAKER_11]: No, probably not going to get into Counter-Strike GO.

2146
02:34:57,435 --> 02:34:57,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2147
02:34:58,436 --> 02:34:59,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what's that?

2148
02:34:59,196 --> 02:35:00,297
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, I'm on the beta now.

2149
02:35:00,377 --> 02:35:01,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the free-to-play one?

2150
02:35:01,638 --> 02:35:06,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's the free-to-play one, but I never really played Counter-Strike, so I don't know.

2151
02:35:07,988 --> 02:35:09,251
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, I'm on the beta now.

2152
02:35:09,372 --> 02:35:10,054
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty good.

2153
02:35:10,214 --> 02:35:12,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Old school Counter-Strike with a new look.

2154
02:35:13,303 --> 02:35:14,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Anywho, keep up the great work, Travis.

2155
02:35:15,762 --> 02:35:16,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for the compliments.

2156
02:35:16,883 --> 02:35:19,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I love getting emails where it's just nothing but compliments.

2157
02:35:19,065 --> 02:35:23,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, first-person shooters have become my second-place genre of choice.

2158
02:35:25,070 --> 02:35:25,690
[SPEAKER_11]: You like bugs.

2159
02:35:25,951 --> 02:35:28,253
[SPEAKER_11]: I like sandbox games.

2160
02:35:28,633 --> 02:35:34,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I do need to go back to playing more Sleeping Dogs because that's pretty awesome.

2161
02:35:34,698 --> 02:35:39,342
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, this is just all killing time before Grand Theft Auto V comes out.

2162
02:35:39,382 --> 02:35:40,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's just...

2163
02:35:40,823 --> 02:35:41,764
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all it's going to be.

2164
02:35:42,104 --> 02:35:48,527
[SPEAKER_11]: That and also maybe a quick excursion to Defense Force on the Vita when that comes out at the end of September in Japan.

2165
02:35:49,168 --> 02:35:49,828
Can't wait.

2166
02:35:51,029 --> 02:35:51,329
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2167
02:35:51,369 --> 02:35:53,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get a little bit angsty here with the FU.

2168
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:54,571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for the mailbag, right?

2169
02:35:55,111 --> 02:35:55,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2170
02:35:55,691 --> 02:35:59,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in the future.

2171
02:35:59,513 --> 02:36:00,574
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, let's get angsty.

2172
02:36:15,804 --> 02:36:17,634
[SPEAKER_03]: FU's of the week time, DarkSakura

2173
02:36:20,103 --> 02:36:24,066
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be difficult for me to say.

2174
02:36:24,987 --> 02:36:27,348
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did say it on my Facebook and got into an argument with my mother.

2175
02:36:28,349 --> 02:36:30,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I can't say anything on Facebook without getting into an argument with my mother.

2176
02:36:30,951 --> 02:36:32,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck that.

2177
02:36:33,993 --> 02:36:41,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to say a current F you to the Republican Party and their choice of who's running and his running mate.

2178
02:36:42,079 --> 02:36:45,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that I... And I really am trying not to be judgmental.

2179
02:36:46,422 --> 02:36:48,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, I'm a judgmental bitch anyway, but it doesn't matter.

2180
02:36:49,724 --> 02:37:13,656
[SPEAKER_06]: but anyone who supports that level of evil I don't know that I would be able to look them in the eye so fuck that level of evil I'm done let's see I guess F you to I don't know be burnt out at work that's it

2181
02:37:15,618 --> 02:37:16,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

2182
02:37:35,843 --> 02:37:53,460
[SPEAKER_03]: and more importantly an F you to a real toll on my body F you to myself for overdoing it at the gym Monday because like I really hurt my leg by I guess I didn't stretch good enough beforehand or I did too much resistance and on the bike because I do a lot of cardio and yeah I was paying for it for like five days I couldn't go back to the gym

2183
02:37:53,780 --> 02:37:54,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted to go.

2184
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:55,180
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may.

2185
02:37:55,940 --> 02:38:04,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what has been drilled into my head by all of... I used to be really good friends with one of my gym... the ladies that taught classes at my gym.

2186
02:38:05,402 --> 02:38:10,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're supposed to do a five-minute light warm-up, then stretch, then do your stuff.

2187
02:38:10,843 --> 02:38:11,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't do that.

2188
02:38:12,083 --> 02:38:14,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I do the light... Never stretch your muscles cold.

2189
02:38:14,484 --> 02:38:17,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't just go right into high resistance, obviously.

2190
02:38:17,384 --> 02:38:20,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to do the up and down, like the little up and down type of thing.

2191
02:38:21,765 --> 02:38:23,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Circuit style.

2192
02:38:23,763 --> 02:38:51,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess but I don't like circuit implies to me you do five minutes on every machine I'm not at that level yet you know I just I it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike and roll around on it for an hour that is an accomplishment for me so but um it's you never want to work out with muscles that are cold you always want like Dan used to just go sit in the sauna before he did anything anything but honestly you actually want to work and then stretch and then work interesting yeah just saying

2193
02:38:51,889 --> 02:38:52,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning something.

2194
02:38:52,970 --> 02:38:54,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Fit didn't tell me that.

2195
02:38:54,871 --> 02:38:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe it did and I wasn't paying attention.

2196
02:38:56,712 --> 02:38:59,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, you know all the time I used to spend working out.

2197
02:39:00,073 --> 02:39:06,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR as well as the Twitter topics.

2198
02:39:06,297 --> 02:39:07,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get out my iPad and see if there are any.

2199
02:39:08,498 --> 02:39:11,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And any last minute stories Loki might have.

2200
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:13,601
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, two final stories for you guys.

2201
02:39:13,641 --> 02:39:13,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2202
02:39:14,421 --> 02:39:43,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so one of the games I mentioned I played this week was Castle Miner Z which has sold 900,000 copies and apparently is one of the fastest selling Xbox Live indie games I'm not sure if it's the fastest selling one but I know because I know I made a zombie with games in it or I made a zombie game made a game with zombies in it sold quite a bit and then I'm sure there's been some other ones that have done well as part of the indie games program

2203
02:39:44,249 --> 02:39:50,432
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely one of the most recent ones, according to the developer.

2204
02:39:51,312 --> 02:39:56,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I guess it is at the top of the daily best-selling area of Xbox.com right now.

2205
02:39:57,454 --> 02:39:59,495
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only 80 Microsoft points, so if you want to check it out.

2206
02:40:00,295 --> 02:40:04,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's also a lot of other good games for 80 Microsoft points on the indie games as well.

2207
02:40:05,257 --> 02:40:06,878
[SPEAKER_11]: and other unrelated news.

2208
02:40:08,298 --> 02:40:09,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Minecraft.

2209
02:40:09,459 --> 02:40:11,139
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 million copies sold on PC.

2210
02:40:11,679 --> 02:40:12,319
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty cool.

2211
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,200
[SPEAKER_11]: So that genre of game seems to be doing pretty well.

2212
02:40:17,161 --> 02:40:18,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It just won't die.

2213
02:40:18,222 --> 02:40:19,382
[SPEAKER_03]: The phenomenon will not stop.

2214
02:40:21,257 --> 02:40:22,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl Rose Remember Guns N' Roses?

2215
02:40:43,002 --> 02:40:48,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl Rose had a preliminary hearing about the Guitar Hero 3 lawsuit.

2216
02:40:48,668 --> 02:40:51,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there is a tentative court date in February 2013.

2217
02:40:53,192 --> 02:41:00,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Axl Rose is pissed about the game, which came out in late 2007 as a reminder, and it will finally go to court in 2013.

2218
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:22,189
[SPEAKER_03]: uh apparently it unlawfully associated Guns N' Roses music with Slash who as you know was formerly with Guns N' Roses and him and Axl Rose they don't get along so Axl Rose was pissed about that basically saying Slash was associated with these songs but they're not his songs so fuck all y'all right

2219
02:41:23,959 --> 02:41:32,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the judge during the preliminary hearing wanted to toss out the claim of fraud because the statute of limitations has expired.

2220
02:41:33,021 --> 02:41:37,002
[SPEAKER_03]: However, let's see, it came up here, quote,

2221
02:41:50,985 --> 02:42:02,613
[SPEAKER_03]: from December 2007 through November 2010, Activision was offering me a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game, a game dedicated to music from the Chinese Democracy album, and other proposals.

2222
02:42:03,513 --> 02:42:04,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

2223
02:42:04,854 --> 02:42:10,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So the judge did dismiss the claim of fraud, but the breach of contract, it is moving forward for February 1st, 2013.

2224
02:42:12,259 --> 02:42:20,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why it took Axl Rose three years to file a lawsuit, because they were basically cock-teasing him about his own game, or so he claims, allegedly, all that good stuff.

2225
02:42:21,886 --> 02:42:41,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes sense why they decided not to do it Because when Guitar Hero Van Halen and Band Hero and all that kind of oversaturated the market You know, those artist-centric video games, none of them really did very well The only one that did marginally good was The Beatles And when The Beatles can only do marginally successful, it's not good enough

2226
02:42:42,305 --> 02:42:43,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to Unemployment!

2227
02:43:10,522 --> 02:43:10,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2228
02:43:11,082 --> 02:43:11,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2229
02:43:12,243 --> 02:43:12,543
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2230
02:43:13,584 --> 02:43:15,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to find something different for the fortune cookie real quick.

2231
02:43:15,925 --> 02:43:17,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best thing ever, so hold on.

2232
02:43:17,526 --> 02:43:18,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you do that.

2233
02:43:18,367 --> 02:43:19,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Send it to me in private message.

2234
02:43:19,747 --> 02:43:20,388
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll switch it out.

2235
02:43:20,828 --> 02:43:23,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Skype line's open, guys.

2236
02:43:23,610 --> 02:43:26,771
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2237
02:43:26,811 --> 02:43:30,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and give us a call if you want to talk about anything we've talked about in the news tonight.

2238
02:43:30,573 --> 02:43:32,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you have something new.

2239
02:43:32,354 --> 02:43:33,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2240
02:43:34,376 --> 02:43:35,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do some quick Twitter topics.

2241
02:43:35,796 --> 02:43:36,637
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a lot of them.

2242
02:43:37,077 --> 02:44:01,023
[SPEAKER_03]: but we do have a couple of them SSJ100 Matt sent us a tweet and I think I already know what this is without going to it but he sends us a tweet that says this is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade machines or what they call gambling machines and he sends us a link to a story from arcadeheroes.com yep I had a feeling look at all these arcade machines on fire they just set them on fire burn it with fire burn it with fire

2243
02:44:03,075 --> 02:44:03,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And there they go.

2244
02:44:04,116 --> 02:44:05,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us?

2245
02:44:06,899 --> 02:44:11,003
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I forgot to mention that as part of my gaming week, I actually played Megazooks.

2246
02:44:12,304 --> 02:44:14,926
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, the old ZZT-type game.

2247
02:44:15,567 --> 02:44:17,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually booted that up.

2248
02:44:17,829 --> 02:44:19,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, oh, hey, I'll make something in this.

2249
02:44:19,791 --> 02:44:25,176
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I realized how out of practice in making stuff with Megazooks I was.

2250
02:44:25,316 --> 02:44:26,697
[SPEAKER_11]: So I said, eh, fuck it.

2251
02:44:27,498 --> 02:44:28,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't care anymore.

2252
02:44:28,159 --> 02:44:29,060
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Megazooks.

2253
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:29,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

2254
02:44:29,941 --> 02:44:30,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

2255
02:44:30,762 --> 02:44:31,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

2256
02:44:32,183 --> 02:44:35,386
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to some tweets from Tigerclaw.

2257
02:44:35,526 --> 02:44:38,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavy Rain Director tells game industry it's time to grow up.

2258
02:44:39,751 --> 02:44:41,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I even get into the article, what do you guys think?

2259
02:44:41,592 --> 02:44:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it time for the games industry to grow up?

2260
02:44:45,234 --> 02:44:47,037
[SPEAKER_03]: We mean by grow up.

2261
02:44:47,617 --> 02:44:49,921
[SPEAKER_06]: One goes to one corner, the other goes to another corner.

2262
02:44:50,081 --> 02:44:56,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the pull quote from Gamasutra, which Tigerclaw linked us to on Twitter at twitter.com.

2263
02:44:56,971 --> 02:44:59,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many first-person shooters can you make?

2264
02:44:59,855 --> 02:45:05,998
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a moment where we need to grow up, and that's David Cage, who is the director of Beyond Two Souls.

2265
02:45:06,118 --> 02:45:07,398
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm sorry.

2266
02:45:08,399 --> 02:45:13,021
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like he needs to grow up because it sounds like he's whining that Heavy Rain didn't sell as well.

2267
02:45:13,341 --> 02:45:13,681
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2268
02:45:13,701 --> 02:45:15,182
[SPEAKER_11]: They're making games that sell well.

2269
02:45:15,402 --> 02:45:18,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on though, because I do agree with this.

2270
02:45:18,305 --> 02:45:21,467
[SPEAKER_03]: That poll quote is a little sensational, but let's get into the full quote here.

2271
02:45:21,507 --> 02:45:22,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm in the article.

2272
02:45:22,268 --> 02:45:29,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, I think we should have more courage in our industry and take more risks because I think this is what the industry needs now.

2273
02:45:29,494 --> 02:45:31,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many first-person shooters can you make?

2274
02:45:31,556 --> 02:45:34,118
[SPEAKER_03]: How many monsters, aliens, zombies can you kill in games?

2275
02:45:34,418 --> 02:45:36,000
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a moment where we need to grow up.

2276
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:36,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to grow up.

2277
02:45:37,701 --> 02:45:40,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I often think the industry suffers of the Peter Pan syndrome.

2278
02:45:40,823 --> 02:45:43,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fact that we don't want to grow up, so we stay kids.

2279
02:45:43,564 --> 02:45:47,746
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is a moment where you need to grow up as an industry, and you cannot keep up with the Peter Pan syndrome.

2280
02:45:48,006 --> 02:45:49,967
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to grow, and I think this is the right time.

2281
02:45:50,487 --> 02:45:57,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I don't agree so much with the second part of that, but the first part about they need some different shit, I kind of agree with it.

2282
02:45:57,730 --> 02:46:00,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Who isn't sick of sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel?

2283
02:46:01,312 --> 02:46:03,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, I guess in some ways we support it.

2284
02:46:03,573 --> 02:46:06,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like a lot of the new ideas.

2285
02:46:07,134 --> 02:46:17,576
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we never experimented with new ideas, we wouldn't have recent hits like Mass Effect or Little Big Planet, which, granted, all spawn their own sequels, but, you know, good games.

2286
02:46:18,296 --> 02:46:20,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Even on the indie side, Braid, Limbo.

2287
02:46:20,457 --> 02:46:23,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Mass Effect kind of turned into just a shooter with this story, but...

2288
02:46:25,638 --> 02:46:34,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just... I think that the reason why they're not taking risks right now, because whenever they seem to try to take risks, they end up not selling well, those games.

2289
02:46:34,942 --> 02:46:38,423
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, some of these companies are in trouble, like THQ, for example.

2290
02:46:38,723 --> 02:46:48,667
[SPEAKER_11]: They took a risk with, you know, making that whole, you know, tablet drawing pad thing, because everyone's like, oh, hey, cool, it's like, you know, like Mario Paint.

2291
02:46:48,847 --> 02:46:50,268
[SPEAKER_11]: And then no one bought it.

2292
02:46:50,568 --> 02:46:51,048
[SPEAKER_11]: And then...

2293
02:46:51,308 --> 02:46:51,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Madworld

2294
02:47:14,389 --> 02:47:16,490
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another example of a game that took risks on the Wii.

2295
02:47:16,791 --> 02:47:17,431
[SPEAKER_11]: No one bought it.

2296
02:47:18,232 --> 02:47:21,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Conduit, pretty awesome first-person shooter game on the Wii.

2297
02:47:21,914 --> 02:47:22,494
[SPEAKER_11]: No one bought it.

2298
02:47:22,875 --> 02:47:24,696
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where your risks come in.

2299
02:47:25,056 --> 02:47:26,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft in chat says, I bought Mario Paint.

2300
02:47:27,898 --> 02:47:33,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, you bought Mario Paint, but you didn't buy the tablet that THQ put out or the one that Ubisoft put out.

2301
02:47:33,702 --> 02:47:36,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I am woefully neglecting the Skype line over here.

2302
02:47:36,423 --> 02:47:37,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me take some calls.

2303
02:47:37,184 --> 02:47:38,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I just missed that one.

2304
02:47:38,084 --> 02:47:38,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me take this one, though.

2305
02:47:38,905 --> 02:47:40,026
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two calls lighting up right now.

2306
02:47:40,346 --> 02:47:41,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2307
02:47:41,286 --> 02:47:41,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2308
02:47:43,257 --> 02:47:44,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?

2309
02:47:45,678 --> 02:47:52,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much, just recovering from going out with my girlfriend today and everything.

2310
02:47:53,101 --> 02:47:54,381
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kings of the Coast yesterday.

2311
02:47:54,802 --> 02:47:55,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Recovering, huh?

2312
02:47:56,902 --> 02:47:59,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is true.

2313
02:48:00,003 --> 02:48:05,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have competed today, but since I have a relationship and everything, she comes first.

2314
02:48:05,505 --> 02:48:07,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

2315
02:48:07,886 --> 02:48:09,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a 2DX tournament today?

2316
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:12,021
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the Kings of the Coast that ate on the break.

2317
02:48:29,972 --> 02:48:35,776
[SPEAKER_00]: That and watching Expendables 2 with her, which she actually enjoyed.

2318
02:48:36,497 --> 02:48:42,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though she was kind of hesitant at first, she actually enjoyed watching old men shoot guns and kill people.

2319
02:48:43,662 --> 02:48:44,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she's a keeper.

2320
02:48:46,084 --> 02:48:49,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's amazing that finally it's done.

2321
02:48:49,607 --> 02:48:52,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaku is now officially over Bomani, everybody.

2322
02:48:52,869 --> 02:48:53,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

2323
02:48:53,109 --> 02:48:54,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Girls and Guns did it.

2324
02:48:54,190 --> 02:48:55,031
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only for today.

2325
02:48:55,771 --> 02:48:56,992
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2326
02:49:21,747 --> 02:49:22,728
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people answered.

2327
02:49:22,768 --> 02:49:27,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're almost wrapping up the doubles tournament right now as we speak.

2328
02:49:27,191 --> 02:49:29,272
[SPEAKER_00]: What version of 2DX do they have out there in Jersey?

2329
02:49:30,193 --> 02:49:30,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln.

2330
02:49:31,494 --> 02:49:33,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Same one they have out not far from me in Queens.

2331
02:49:34,356 --> 02:49:34,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2332
02:49:35,737 --> 02:49:36,157
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

2333
02:49:36,177 --> 02:49:37,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not hard to pack eight on the break.

2334
02:49:37,678 --> 02:49:41,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember it was kind of a small place because the arcade machines took up a lot of room.

2335
02:49:41,881 --> 02:49:43,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be hard to pack that joint.

2336
02:49:43,643 --> 02:49:46,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say the same thing about SVGL is similar.

2337
02:49:46,725 --> 02:49:49,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not hard to pack that place because there's not a lot of space.

2338
02:49:51,101 --> 02:49:54,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, let's digress a little bit.

2339
02:49:55,024 --> 02:50:12,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to post up a link to an article that you probably already discussed probably earlier before I got on about the Assassin's Creed 3 director basically chiding Japanese games and to the point of playing the race card because they're basically getting a free pass.

2340
02:50:13,016 --> 02:50:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we didn't bring this up earlier, so I'm glad you are.

2341
02:50:16,618 --> 02:50:17,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and tell us a little bit about this.

2342
02:50:18,641 --> 02:50:35,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, long story short, the creative director of Assassin's Creed 3, Alex Hutchinson, he basically went on a rant earlier last week in deriding why certain Japanese games are getting free passes, like something about...

2343
02:50:37,006 --> 02:50:44,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, saying stuff about, like, just think how many Japanese games are released where the stories are literally gibberish.

2344
02:50:44,410 --> 02:50:45,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally gibberish.

2345
02:50:45,610 --> 02:50:50,313
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say, oh, it's brilliant.

2346
02:50:50,353 --> 02:50:55,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me read this quote here, and this is what you're going off of here, and this is in an interview with CVG.

2347
02:50:56,396 --> 02:51:01,578
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, just think about how many Japanese games are released where their stories are literally gibberish.

2348
02:51:02,019 --> 02:51:02,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally gibberish.

2349
02:51:02,739 --> 02:51:06,261
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way you could write it with a straight face and journalists say, oh, it's brilliant.

2350
02:51:06,881 --> 02:51:10,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Gears of War comes out and apparently it's the worst written narrative in a game ever.

2351
02:51:10,622 --> 02:51:13,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take Gears of War over Bayonetta any time.

2352
02:51:14,123 --> 02:51:18,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It's patronizing to say, oh, those Japanese stories, they don't really mean what they're doing.

2353
02:51:18,465 --> 02:51:21,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get why critics didn't like Gears of War.

2354
02:51:21,826 --> 02:51:22,706
[SPEAKER_03]: That's news to me.

2355
02:51:22,726 --> 02:51:24,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta was a better game.

2356
02:51:25,907 --> 02:51:29,610
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real kicker is his first response.

2357
02:51:30,171 --> 02:51:31,171
[SPEAKER_00]: You want my real answer?

2358
02:51:31,291 --> 02:51:37,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a subtle racism in the business, especially on the journalist side, where Japanese developers are forgiven for doing what they do.

2359
02:51:37,876 --> 02:51:39,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's condescending to do this.

2360
02:51:40,538 --> 02:51:42,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So he really, like, goes off the bat.

2361
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:45,483
[SPEAKER_00]: He really, like, goes for the juggler on the first sentence.

2362
02:51:45,603 --> 02:51:50,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I just... I think he's... I mean, what about... We just talked... I'll tell you what we did talk about earlier in the show.

2363
02:51:50,928 --> 02:51:51,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy.

2364
02:51:52,389 --> 02:51:57,514
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Final Fantasy XIII did get hazed for a lot of that stuff and being too linear in a way.

2365
02:51:57,554 --> 02:52:00,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, XIV got right through the damn coals.

2366
02:52:00,756 --> 02:52:01,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

2367
02:52:01,437 --> 02:52:04,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 14 was an abomination because it was poorly executed.

2368
02:52:05,522 --> 02:52:18,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that so many gaffes in the beginning and then to the point where they had to actually, you know, the creative director and the producers had to hand in the resignations, it was just a cluster.

2369
02:52:19,711 --> 02:52:46,783
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas if you look at other American RPGs like Skyrim which I'm actually going through right now thank you Steam sale of last month but you see how versed that game is it's getting to the point where I'm putting at least two hours a night right now just on Skyrim alone because it's so many things to do you can level up your character if you wanted to continue on the main quest do some side quests try your luck in killing giants

2370
02:52:47,583 --> 02:52:48,846
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also buggy as shit.

2371
02:52:48,866 --> 02:52:54,557
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a GTA, but with actual goals towards beefing up your character stats.

2372
02:52:56,101 --> 02:53:14,269
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think what goes wrong with Japanese games like Final Fantasy, it only sticks to, I mean, there is an open world, there is a concept of an open world, but everything is pretty much linear in the sense that you have to do X mission, Y mission, side quests, and obviously the occasional grinding.

2373
02:53:14,289 --> 02:53:21,392
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no retribution where you can attack freely any other type of enemy, because the combat system is so rigid.

2374
02:53:23,672 --> 02:53:30,820
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that you randomly encounter enemies, you have to fight within that realm of your enemy versus your characters.

2375
02:53:31,681 --> 02:53:35,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm using Final Fantasy VII as a frame of reference, but you get the idea.

2376
02:53:36,446 --> 02:53:45,216
[SPEAKER_00]: The way Bethesda outdid Squeenix was just thinking outside the box and applying what they've already done best.

2377
02:53:45,356 --> 02:53:47,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't people just like what they like?

2378
02:53:47,436 --> 02:53:50,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just like what we like and leave people alone.

2379
02:53:50,377 --> 02:53:55,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't understand why he's gotta, you know, some people like the Japanese stuff and let it be.

2380
02:53:56,398 --> 02:54:02,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think just because you like one Japanese game means you love them all or just because you love all Japanese games there's gonna be a few you hate, you know?

2381
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:10,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just way too broad of a statement and I'm hoping this is just media sensationalism here that we're only perpetuating with this call.

2382
02:54:10,561 --> 02:54:14,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would really just hope that he's not that narrow-minded.

2383
02:54:16,411 --> 02:54:17,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess so.

2384
02:54:17,692 --> 02:54:17,953
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2385
02:54:18,573 --> 02:54:20,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaku, I got to wrap up and let you go so we can get more calls.

2386
02:54:20,855 --> 02:54:22,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts here before we let you go?

2387
02:54:23,998 --> 02:54:24,979
[SPEAKER_03]: That was about it.

2388
02:54:25,360 --> 02:54:25,640
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2389
02:54:25,700 --> 02:54:27,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun and be safe.

2390
02:54:27,442 --> 02:54:28,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Be safe, Zaku.

2391
02:54:28,022 --> 02:54:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

2392
02:54:28,643 --> 02:54:28,903
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2393
02:54:28,943 --> 02:54:29,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2394
02:54:31,376 --> 02:54:48,332
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call I'll probably have you guys take the next call because I need to go start dinner so 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio I think I missed a Twitter topic

2395
02:54:49,113 --> 02:54:49,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

2396
02:54:49,754 --> 02:54:55,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was one, because I was in the middle of one, but then there was a second one that Tigerclaw had sent that I wanted to get to.

2397
02:54:55,598 --> 02:54:56,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, never mind.

2398
02:54:56,758 --> 02:54:57,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a reprieve.

2399
02:54:57,759 --> 02:54:59,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So, DarkSakura, Loki, one of you can take this call.

2400
02:54:59,981 --> 02:55:00,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready?

2401
02:55:00,421 --> 02:55:00,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2402
02:55:02,362 --> 02:55:02,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello!

2403
02:55:03,143 --> 02:55:04,944
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Orange Lounge Radio.

2404
02:55:05,104 --> 02:55:05,585
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want?

2405
02:55:06,225 --> 02:55:12,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger, tiger, tiger, tiger, chew, chew, it's too sorry.

2406
02:55:12,669 --> 02:55:14,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger, I'm chewing for you.

2407
02:55:16,363 --> 02:55:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how are you this evening, Jim Sally?

2408
02:55:19,505 --> 02:55:20,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.

2409
02:55:20,265 --> 02:55:21,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you picked up the phone today.

2410
02:55:22,407 --> 02:55:23,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.

2411
02:55:24,008 --> 02:55:25,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I use my phone operator voice?

2412
02:55:26,548 --> 02:55:30,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, you do your phone operator voice and I'll do my annoying Portuguese mama voice.

2413
02:55:31,029 --> 02:55:32,790
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if we can do some funny coffee here.

2414
02:55:33,330 --> 02:55:34,110
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be good.

2415
02:55:34,451 --> 02:55:35,471
[SPEAKER_01]: You do your voice, I'll do my voice.

2416
02:55:35,491 --> 02:55:38,952
[SPEAKER_06]: See, now I'm laughing too hard to do the phone operator voice.

2417
02:55:39,192 --> 02:55:40,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, I call for the job.

2418
02:55:41,993 --> 02:55:43,874
[SPEAKER_10]: I come to clean your stuff.

2419
02:55:45,694 --> 02:55:47,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put your stuff in the corner.

2420
02:55:47,875 --> 02:55:49,875
[SPEAKER_06]: My son come to your house today.

2421
02:55:49,895 --> 02:55:52,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Put his underwear clean.

2422
02:55:53,717 --> 02:55:54,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's up, otherwise?

2423
02:55:55,911 --> 02:56:04,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling to have a discussion about the new Walking Dead game that I downloaded on my iPad this weekend.

2424
02:56:05,175 --> 02:56:06,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Walking Dead.

2425
02:56:06,596 --> 02:56:07,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Walking Dead.

2426
02:56:07,496 --> 02:56:10,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by Telltale and it's nice.

2427
02:56:10,618 --> 02:56:11,618
[SPEAKER_01]: We like Telltale.

2428
02:56:12,218 --> 02:56:12,518
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

2429
02:56:12,718 --> 02:56:13,979
[SPEAKER_06]: We like Telltale.

2430
02:56:14,639 --> 02:56:15,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them too, man.

2431
02:56:15,420 --> 02:56:21,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, this is going to be a little bit of a spoiler review because I only played the first half hour of it anyway.

2432
02:56:21,462 --> 02:56:23,303
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first episode so spoilers are okay.

2433
02:56:23,743 --> 02:56:24,564
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a scene.

2434
02:56:24,984 --> 02:56:25,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen.

2435
02:56:25,908 --> 02:56:29,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this scene where I was in a house and a zombie came after me.

2436
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:31,532
[SPEAKER_01]: A little zombie like babysitter shit.

2437
02:56:31,892 --> 02:56:33,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kicked that zombie in the snatch.

2438
02:56:34,334 --> 02:56:37,836
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the zombie fell down and I picked up the hammer.

2439
02:56:38,377 --> 02:56:39,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

2440
02:56:40,038 --> 02:56:42,820
[SPEAKER_01]: You schmuck the zombie in the face with the hammer.

2441
02:56:43,160 --> 02:56:45,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Toto's like, hey, would you like to stop?

2442
02:56:46,242 --> 02:56:46,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Or keep going?

2443
02:56:46,943 --> 02:56:50,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I'll keep smashing this thing in the face right now.

2444
02:56:51,034 --> 02:56:52,374
[SPEAKER_01]: You smash it.

2445
02:56:52,855 --> 02:56:53,695
[SPEAKER_01]: You smash it.

2446
02:56:54,995 --> 02:56:56,055
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks so gross.

2447
02:56:56,135 --> 02:56:58,016
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the kind of options gamers want.

2448
02:56:58,656 --> 02:56:59,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet satisfied.

2449
02:57:00,397 --> 02:57:02,217
[SPEAKER_01]: It was gross yet satisfied.

2450
02:57:02,637 --> 02:57:03,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to see more?

2451
02:57:04,758 --> 02:57:05,438
[SPEAKER_01]: We can oblige.

2452
02:57:05,538 --> 02:57:05,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.

2453
02:57:05,778 --> 02:57:06,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get enough of it.

2454
02:57:08,399 --> 02:57:09,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so simple.

2455
02:57:10,699 --> 02:57:11,539
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit.

2456
02:57:12,600 --> 02:57:17,141
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it's just point and click, but there is a bit of a quick time to it every now and again that you got to do.

2457
02:57:17,608 --> 02:57:19,769
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like baby quick time, you know what I'm saying?

2458
02:57:20,009 --> 02:57:20,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2459
02:57:20,249 --> 02:57:21,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's pretty baby quick time.

2460
02:57:22,030 --> 02:57:24,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is exactly what I need on a Sunday night.

2461
02:57:24,491 --> 02:57:27,572
[SPEAKER_10]: When I've been having salad.

2462
02:57:28,012 --> 02:57:32,014
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really salad.

2463
02:57:32,074 --> 02:57:35,656
[SPEAKER_10]: It's green leaves that make you talk like this.

2464
02:57:38,297 --> 02:57:38,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

2465
02:57:39,697 --> 02:57:40,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, hey.

2466
02:57:42,659 --> 02:57:43,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I also...

2467
02:57:44,322 --> 02:57:45,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Rob even around?

2468
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:46,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Rob leaving?

2469
02:57:46,683 --> 02:57:48,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob was being domestic.

2470
02:57:48,204 --> 02:57:49,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got back.

2471
02:57:49,945 --> 02:57:50,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jim Sally.

2472
02:57:51,166 --> 02:57:52,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Rob Roberts.

2473
02:57:52,566 --> 02:57:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

2474
02:57:53,507 --> 02:57:54,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

2475
02:57:54,147 --> 02:57:55,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being domestic right now.

2476
02:57:55,568 --> 02:57:57,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to walk away from the studio for a minute.

2477
02:57:57,829 --> 02:57:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's up?

2478
02:57:58,950 --> 02:58:00,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, Rob.

2479
02:58:01,411 --> 02:58:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I started shopping for microphones.

2480
02:58:09,216 --> 02:58:11,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you setting up the Jim Sally Studios?

2481
02:58:12,397 --> 02:58:13,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, man.

2482
02:58:14,157 --> 02:58:16,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time for pillow talk, man.

2483
02:58:17,638 --> 02:58:21,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I even started making a little theme music and stuff, man, for the show.

2484
02:58:21,619 --> 02:58:28,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave Jim Sally a name for his show because Jim Sally suggested he be the opener for the opener.

2485
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:31,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he could open for Bobby, which I don't consider Bobby an opener.

2486
02:58:31,521 --> 02:58:32,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I consider him a co-headliner.

2487
02:58:32,821 --> 02:58:34,981
[SPEAKER_03]: But since he calls himself an opener, I'll go with that.

2488
02:58:35,302 --> 02:58:37,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Sally said he could be the opener for the opener.

2489
02:58:37,662 --> 02:58:38,143
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2490
02:58:54,138 --> 02:58:56,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that, the night train.

2491
02:58:56,681 --> 02:58:57,181
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

2492
02:58:57,241 --> 02:58:57,762
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

2493
02:58:58,883 --> 02:59:00,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just throwing it out there.

2494
02:59:00,905 --> 02:59:08,412
[SPEAKER_03]: For you, Jim, or for anybody out there in the universe listening to this show, VOG Network, we are very interested in getting some movie

2495
02:59:09,397 --> 02:59:10,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast would be great.

2496
02:59:10,798 --> 02:59:16,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Book podcast is like at the top of my want list right now, be it manga, comic, or written book.

2497
02:59:17,241 --> 02:59:18,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep bugging my wife.

2498
02:59:18,941 --> 02:59:25,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I would love to see like a role play, like an old school tabletop gaming.

2499
02:59:25,885 --> 02:59:29,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be LARPing Dungeons and Dragons, and I love, love, love.

2500
02:59:29,927 --> 02:59:30,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I would so do this.

2501
02:59:31,127 --> 02:59:36,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, love, love the idea of a game that is podcast.

2502
02:59:36,772 --> 02:59:39,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that would be difficult.

2503
02:59:39,214 --> 02:59:41,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody who's actually running a game to be podcast.

2504
02:59:42,076 --> 02:59:44,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone at the table would need a microphone.

2505
02:59:45,319 --> 02:59:48,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, you get some good boom mics.

2506
02:59:48,562 --> 02:59:51,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd have to have the die cam.

2507
02:59:51,665 --> 02:59:53,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You see them rolling and see who's cheating at the table.

2508
02:59:54,567 --> 02:59:55,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't nudge that.

2509
02:59:55,908 --> 02:59:56,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I sneezed.

2510
02:59:57,372 --> 03:00:00,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie just rolled a 7 on the 20-sided die.

2511
03:00:02,142 --> 03:00:04,707
[SPEAKER_02]: This means that she has failed her intelligence check.

2512
03:00:07,057 --> 03:00:09,939
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2513
03:00:35,833 --> 03:00:36,654
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be the problem.

2514
03:00:36,934 --> 03:00:37,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyhow.

2515
03:00:38,135 --> 03:00:42,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just leave the microphone on today when you leave and I'll come do some pillow talk.

2516
03:00:43,460 --> 03:00:44,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready for it.

2517
03:00:44,601 --> 03:00:45,562
[SPEAKER_01]: That I might be okay with.

2518
03:00:45,702 --> 03:00:49,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a review of 21 Jump Street.

2519
03:00:52,488 --> 03:00:55,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a little review snippet that maybe you're going to hear about.

2520
03:00:56,051 --> 03:00:57,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of dick jokes in it.

2521
03:00:57,693 --> 03:00:59,374
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good dick jokes in it.

2522
03:00:59,694 --> 03:01:00,375
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?

2523
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:02,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Best use of comedic dick in 2010.

2524
03:01:02,721 --> 03:01:11,745
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for a show that would end up being on like after midnight on the East Coast on a Sunday night, Monday morning, anything goes, really.

2525
03:01:12,365 --> 03:01:13,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything goes.

2526
03:01:13,165 --> 03:01:13,966
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Jim Sally.

2527
03:01:14,526 --> 03:01:15,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything goes.

2528
03:01:15,286 --> 03:01:17,627
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not bitches and hoes.

2529
03:01:18,628 --> 03:01:18,888
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2530
03:01:19,548 --> 03:01:21,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?

2531
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:29,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just like to say thank you for the encouragement and and

2532
03:01:29,608 --> 03:01:32,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try really hard to do stuff for you.

2533
03:01:32,710 --> 03:01:33,311
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

2534
03:01:33,631 --> 03:01:34,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

2535
03:01:35,032 --> 03:01:35,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime, buddy.

2536
03:01:35,832 --> 03:01:38,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, take care and give baby a kiss for me.

2537
03:01:39,675 --> 03:01:41,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm biting my pillow right now.

2538
03:01:43,358 --> 03:01:43,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Careful.

2539
03:01:43,978 --> 03:01:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, bye.

2540
03:01:49,127 --> 03:01:50,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he know what that means?

2541
03:01:52,049 --> 03:01:55,712
[SPEAKER_03]: You used that word, but I don't think it means what you think it means.

2542
03:01:59,114 --> 03:02:02,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, if we did a tabletop gaming cast, it would have to be called Roll to Hit.

2543
03:02:04,738 --> 03:02:05,759
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the comment in chat?

2544
03:02:05,779 --> 03:02:07,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Chiggers says, call it Reroll.

2545
03:02:07,580 --> 03:02:08,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

2546
03:02:08,020 --> 03:02:08,520
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.

2547
03:02:09,401 --> 03:02:12,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan says, I want to see an anime show on VOG Network.

2548
03:02:13,624 --> 03:02:16,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma might want to let you know there is one on Tuesdays at 6.30 Pacific.

2549
03:02:21,541 --> 03:02:22,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Answering listeners' demands.

2550
03:02:24,045 --> 03:02:25,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see an anime show on VOG Network.

2551
03:02:26,028 --> 03:02:26,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2552
03:02:26,709 --> 03:02:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Tune in on Tuesday.

2553
03:02:27,731 --> 03:02:28,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

2554
03:02:29,534 --> 03:02:31,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, you don't see it.

2555
03:02:35,273 --> 03:02:37,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, is there any more calls going to come in?

2556
03:02:37,375 --> 03:02:38,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hello.

2557
03:02:39,096 --> 03:02:39,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.

2558
03:02:39,877 --> 03:02:40,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot Twitter.

2559
03:02:40,978 --> 03:02:41,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob.

2560
03:02:41,559 --> 03:02:42,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop forgetting Twitter.

2561
03:02:42,319 --> 03:02:43,120
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that noise?

2562
03:02:43,140 --> 03:02:43,761
[SPEAKER_07]: All that forgetting.

2563
03:02:43,921 --> 03:02:44,121
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2564
03:02:45,182 --> 03:02:46,023
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a weird noise.

2565
03:02:46,663 --> 03:02:46,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2566
03:02:48,425 --> 03:02:50,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma in chat says, thank you.

2567
03:02:51,147 --> 03:02:51,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome, BB.

2568
03:02:52,702 --> 03:02:55,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one more tweet from Tiger Claw.

2569
03:02:56,545 --> 03:02:57,566
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I fucking hate this.

2570
03:02:57,586 --> 03:03:01,670
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to mobile websites, GameSpot now has a free iPad app.

2571
03:03:01,730 --> 03:03:02,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Click OK to get that.

2572
03:03:02,831 --> 03:03:03,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck off.

2573
03:03:03,131 --> 03:03:03,952
[SPEAKER_03]: No one, Kerr.

2574
03:03:03,972 --> 03:03:05,734
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wanted your app, I would go download it.

2575
03:03:06,995 --> 03:03:09,797
[SPEAKER_03]: The worst are the ones with the gigantic splash screens.

2576
03:03:09,877 --> 03:03:12,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, Tiger Claw linked me to a GameSpot article.

2577
03:03:12,620 --> 03:03:15,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but there's a call coming in, so you'll just have to wait and see what it's about.

2578
03:03:17,264 --> 03:03:18,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2579
03:03:18,204 --> 03:03:18,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

2580
03:03:19,312 --> 03:03:21,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, hello there, fine Olarians.

2581
03:03:21,913 --> 03:03:22,613
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sterlok.

2582
03:03:23,394 --> 03:03:24,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I got called fine.

2583
03:03:24,934 --> 03:03:25,835
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Sterlok?

2584
03:03:28,155 --> 03:03:28,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Not too much.

2585
03:03:30,796 --> 03:03:37,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you talked about the Vita firmware update in Part A. I kind of missed a lot of it.

2586
03:03:37,959 --> 03:03:43,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Briefly, it let off our rapid-fire news tonight, but we talked quickly about it, so what do you want to say about it?

2587
03:03:45,062 --> 03:03:47,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it kind of makes me want a Vita now.

2588
03:03:48,237 --> 03:03:50,761
[SPEAKER_03]: A firmware update makes you want a Vita.

2589
03:03:50,801 --> 03:03:52,663
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the firmware update that makes you want it?

2590
03:03:53,424 --> 03:03:57,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they added a feature that should have been in there from the beginning.

2591
03:03:58,351 --> 03:03:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is?

2592
03:04:00,177 --> 03:04:09,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Use of the buttons in the home screen, which you would think would have been in there by default, but I don't know what the hell Sony was thinking.

2593
03:04:09,582 --> 03:04:14,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, something the listeners may not remember about you from previous phone calls to the show, but you're blind, right?

2594
03:04:15,045 --> 03:04:15,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

2595
03:04:15,525 --> 03:04:19,708
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that is kind of important if you're trying to navigate.

2596
03:04:19,728 --> 03:04:28,873
[SPEAKER_05]: That was literally, I was pretty stoked for the Vita when I heard about some of the games that were coming to it, especially like Mortal Kombat.

2597
03:04:30,013 --> 03:04:33,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Something like sound shapes, too, is awesome.

2598
03:04:34,097 --> 03:04:42,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think even being, you know, with Blind, the way you kind of interact with the sounds and the fact that the sounds kind of drive the stage a little bit, I think you'd get a kick out of it.

2599
03:04:43,265 --> 03:04:44,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Okay, um...

2600
03:04:47,441 --> 03:04:49,583
[SPEAKER_05]: How prevalent is the touchscreen in sound shapes?

2601
03:04:49,623 --> 03:04:51,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really do a lot of research into it.

2602
03:04:51,565 --> 03:04:52,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it all button-based?

2603
03:04:52,386 --> 03:04:53,347
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to use it at all.

2604
03:04:53,687 --> 03:04:56,470
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to design stages, you have to use it a little bit.

2605
03:04:57,652 --> 03:04:58,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2606
03:04:58,452 --> 03:04:59,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to check that one out.

2607
03:04:59,954 --> 03:05:01,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you get a kick out of it.

2608
03:05:01,676 --> 03:05:10,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a big fan of the Rhythm Heaven slash Tengoku series on the GBA and DS.

2609
03:05:11,644 --> 03:05:13,065
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Wii most recently.

2610
03:05:13,565 --> 03:05:14,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are pretty awesome.

2611
03:05:14,486 --> 03:05:21,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that maybe Sony realized, you know, oops, we're not really being accommodating for all people?

2612
03:05:21,610 --> 03:05:29,014
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some people that did send letters to them about it and not all of them being blind.

2613
03:05:29,054 --> 03:05:32,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard even a lot of sighted people bitching.

2614
03:05:33,689 --> 03:05:34,990
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2615
03:05:50,603 --> 03:05:51,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty awesome.

2616
03:05:52,023 --> 03:05:52,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2617
03:06:20,475 --> 03:06:23,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, Sterlok, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2618
03:06:24,233 --> 03:06:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

2619
03:06:26,188 --> 03:06:27,729
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura has deployed her 20-sided die.

2620
03:06:27,749 --> 03:06:28,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Laughter

2621
03:06:53,047 --> 03:06:55,849
[SPEAKER_05]: She's currently attempting her saving throw.

2622
03:06:58,450 --> 03:07:00,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and she didn't quite make it.

2623
03:07:02,501 --> 03:07:05,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love it, but we'll have to see what's out there.

2624
03:07:05,462 --> 03:07:16,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as Bobby's emphasizing in chat, we are kind of looking for shows that are already... Because we don't really want to bring on... Again, it's all about... People might have an idea and like, oh, I want to do this, I want to do this.

2625
03:07:16,864 --> 03:07:19,725
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they don't realize how hard it really is to keep it going.

2626
03:07:19,745 --> 03:07:23,186
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of work that goes into doing something.

2627
03:07:23,226 --> 03:07:23,906
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I do a...

2628
03:07:25,362 --> 03:07:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I do a little shameless plug.

2629
03:07:27,824 --> 03:07:29,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

2630
03:07:29,766 --> 03:07:33,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I do a little show on Thursday afternoons.

2631
03:07:34,149 --> 03:07:34,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

2632
03:07:34,489 --> 03:07:35,130
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my Twitter.

2633
03:07:37,392 --> 03:07:38,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have Mario Sounds on my Twitter.

2634
03:07:39,293 --> 03:07:39,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Giant nerd.

2635
03:07:39,974 --> 03:07:41,235
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

2636
03:07:42,636 --> 03:07:43,737
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, 3 to 5 Eastern.

2637
03:07:46,943 --> 03:08:07,415
[SPEAKER_05]: On Thursdays I do a show on a station called Infinity Radio called Video Game Valhalla where I play two hours of video game music or stuff from the Angry Video Game Nerd or the Spoonie one, stuff like that.

2638
03:08:07,695 --> 03:08:10,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically anything pertaining to video games.

2639
03:08:10,697 --> 03:08:11,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet that's a good time.

2640
03:08:11,377 --> 03:08:12,278
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a good announcer voice.

2641
03:08:12,318 --> 03:08:12,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

2642
03:08:12,778 --> 03:08:13,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just saying that.

2643
03:08:13,879 --> 03:08:15,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet that's a good time.

2644
03:08:15,300 --> 03:08:17,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not up against any VOG programming.

2645
03:08:17,061 --> 03:08:17,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're good.

2646
03:08:18,402 --> 03:08:18,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's good.

2647
03:08:19,923 --> 03:08:20,143
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2648
03:08:20,363 --> 03:08:22,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Sterlok, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2649
03:08:22,184 --> 03:08:23,165
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks so much for your call.

2650
03:08:23,625 --> 03:08:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2651
03:08:23,946 --> 03:08:24,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

2652
03:08:24,486 --> 03:08:25,166
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that again?

2653
03:08:25,226 --> 03:08:25,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Game Valhalla?

2654
03:08:26,227 --> 03:08:29,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Video Game Valhalla on Infinity Radio.

2655
03:08:29,909 --> 03:08:30,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

2656
03:08:30,550 --> 03:08:30,830
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2657
03:08:31,310 --> 03:08:31,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out, folks.

2658
03:08:32,291 --> 03:08:33,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, Sterlok.

2659
03:08:33,492 --> 03:08:33,752
[SPEAKER_05]: See ya.

2660
03:08:33,972 --> 03:08:34,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

2661
03:08:34,312 --> 03:08:34,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.

2662
03:08:35,433 --> 03:08:37,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2663
03:08:37,094 --> 03:08:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for calling in.

2664
03:08:38,714 --> 03:08:42,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if you didn't get through, although I've got to admit, it was a little light on the calls tonight.

2665
03:08:42,176 --> 03:08:44,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I got almost everybody who was trying to get through.

2666
03:08:44,137 --> 03:08:46,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I missed you, I may not have seen it, I'm very sorry.

2667
03:08:47,038 --> 03:08:50,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2668
03:08:50,599 --> 03:08:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get back real quick to that tweet that I mentioned from Tigerclaw.

2669
03:08:54,261 --> 03:08:55,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll close out with this tonight.

2670
03:08:56,341 --> 03:09:01,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Dice, the Battlefield developer, afraid to release Battlefield 3 mod tools.

2671
03:09:02,984 --> 03:09:04,705
[SPEAKER_03]: They said at GDC Europe

2672
03:09:05,925 --> 03:09:10,507
[SPEAKER_03]: That apparently the studio was fearful of the implications of releasing the mod tools.

2673
03:09:11,027 --> 03:09:24,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, they were quote, and this is a quote from Magnus Trottersen, who is the general manager of DICE, said quote, "...afraid of all the things that can come with releasing the code."

2674
03:09:24,793 --> 03:09:46,484
[SPEAKER_03]: quote if we do mod support we want to do it really really well we are not ready to do this yet interesting i guess oh and also that if the mods come out they want console players in too i think that part's kind of interesting as well is that they don't want to just just let it be for pc they want console players to get in on the fun that's kind of nice pretty cool

2675
03:09:47,877 --> 03:09:52,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple last-minute tweets here, so what the hell, I'll read them.

2676
03:09:53,401 --> 03:09:57,323
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple tweets here from Ratchet1785 on Twitter.

2677
03:09:57,343 --> 03:10:00,626
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally came in one minute ago, so I'll go ahead and read these.

2678
03:10:00,646 --> 03:10:03,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet1785 asks, Are you guys excited about Borderlands 2?

2679
03:10:04,588 --> 03:10:06,690
[SPEAKER_03]: First live show, by the way, and this is the best.

2680
03:10:06,750 --> 03:10:07,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Three-year listener.

2681
03:10:07,710 --> 03:10:08,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, howdy-doody.

2682
03:10:09,051 --> 03:10:11,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And get your butt in chat next time if you're not already there.

2683
03:10:11,313 --> 03:10:11,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see you there.

2684
03:10:11,893 --> 03:10:15,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Live.VogNetwork.com Are you guys excited about Borderlands 2?

2685
03:10:15,596 --> 03:10:15,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2686
03:10:16,416 --> 03:10:17,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even have to ask Loki.

2687
03:10:19,328 --> 03:10:47,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if excited is the right word but I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2 because I liked what I played of Borderlands 1 I really need to play more of it so yeah I will check it out and I like some of the things they're doing with it I don't like that whole mess earlier this week about the whole girlfriend mode and all that crap that was going around but I'm just going to chalk a lot of that up to the media and Twitter and the internet kind of latching on to one thing and then running with it

2688
03:10:48,428 --> 03:11:09,792
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's not going to affect the quality of the game I think at the end of the day the way that they're doing like an easy mode tree that sounds great to me that's not a girlfriend mode that's a me mode and I know there's a lot of people that feel the same way you know I don't mind playing the games on an easier mode to get the story and the experience I'm actually planning on playing through Mass Effect 3 on Insanity

2689
03:11:11,209 --> 03:11:11,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck!

2690
03:11:12,510 --> 03:11:13,271
[SPEAKER_03]: In god mode.

2691
03:11:13,711 --> 03:11:14,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck?

2692
03:11:14,331 --> 03:11:14,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2693
03:11:15,112 --> 03:11:16,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well then, that's no fair.

2694
03:11:17,333 --> 03:11:17,494
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2695
03:11:17,874 --> 03:11:24,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and lastly, also tell your listeners I'm giving away a copy of Borderlands 2 on my gaming channel on YouTubes.

2696
03:11:24,659 --> 03:11:25,559
[SPEAKER_03]: But then he didn't link it.

2697
03:11:26,620 --> 03:11:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna hope it's the same name, Ratchet1785.

2698
03:11:29,202 --> 03:11:33,145
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not the same name, I guess tune in next week.

2699
03:11:33,626 --> 03:11:35,267
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's going to do it for tweets tonight.

2700
03:11:35,587 --> 03:11:44,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR and that's about going to do it for the show tonight but not until we go around and get everybody's final thought.

2701
03:11:45,593 --> 03:11:48,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, we'll start with you because you said there's no last minute stories, right?

2702
03:11:48,535 --> 03:11:49,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, I just don't care.

2703
03:11:51,533 --> 03:11:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

2704
03:11:52,033 --> 03:11:53,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a three-hour show tonight.

2705
03:11:53,294 --> 03:11:53,874
[SPEAKER_03]: We can wrap up.

2706
03:11:54,755 --> 03:12:00,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, plus the podcast is even going to be a little longer because, thankfully, we have the Darksiders 2 song in there.

2707
03:12:00,518 --> 03:12:02,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're good to wrap up.

2708
03:12:02,560 --> 03:12:04,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2709
03:12:04,681 --> 03:12:08,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to say retweet that thing that I tweeted about Evilot.

2710
03:12:09,864 --> 03:12:15,930
[SPEAKER_11]: They're having a contest on their site, and whoever gets the most retweets gets a picture drawn by one of the artists.

2711
03:12:16,130 --> 03:12:22,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And she does really kick-ass art, so I would like a picture because she does pixel art and it looks fucking awesome.

2712
03:12:22,736 --> 03:12:23,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so you need a retweet.

2713
03:12:23,957 --> 03:12:25,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I need a retweet.

2714
03:12:25,679 --> 03:12:28,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I retweeted, or I sent it out, and I can't...

2715
03:12:29,386 --> 03:12:36,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't figure out how to, like, and I did it once, because obviously I copied it in the chat room, but I can't remember how I got the direct link to that tweet.

2716
03:12:36,648 --> 03:12:44,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, you click on, if you go to your actual Twitter page, I think there's a way to see details, or detailed tweet or something like that.

2717
03:12:44,570 --> 03:12:44,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, okay.

2718
03:12:44,951 --> 03:12:51,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyways, it's on my Twitter, at LokiOLR, and just retweeted, you know, it's the one talking about Evil Eye.

2719
03:12:51,973 --> 03:12:55,374
[SPEAKER_11]: It's done by FoodieMonster, or he's the animator on it.

2720
03:12:55,394 --> 03:12:56,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I still would like to know where FoodieMonster went.

2721
03:12:57,915 --> 03:12:58,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been, FootyMonster?

2722
03:12:59,557 --> 03:12:59,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back to OLR.

2723
03:12:59,998 --> 03:13:08,889
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably busy, but seriously, you should go back and even... I mean, it looks like a pretty cool game, and they're under halfway there right now.

2724
03:13:08,909 --> 03:13:09,771
[SPEAKER_11]: They're only looking for 10 grand.

2725
03:13:10,336 --> 03:13:13,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I will retweet from the OLR account my personal account just for you.

2726
03:13:13,298 --> 03:13:14,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I will appreciate that.

2727
03:13:14,679 --> 03:13:15,520
[SPEAKER_11]: And the Horde House account.

2728
03:13:15,840 --> 03:13:21,324
[SPEAKER_11]: If anybody else can do it, that'd be awesome because right now I'm the only one who retweets on there.

2729
03:13:21,385 --> 03:13:25,087
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would like to, you know... I want a picture.

2730
03:13:25,127 --> 03:13:25,968
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks awesome.

2731
03:13:26,188 --> 03:13:26,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

2732
03:13:26,989 --> 03:13:27,489
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

2733
03:13:28,030 --> 03:13:29,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should go back to the game because it's awesome.

2734
03:13:29,531 --> 03:13:30,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I backed it, so check it out.

2735
03:13:31,352 --> 03:13:32,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Good deal.

2736
03:13:33,314 --> 03:13:34,334
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought tonight.

2737
03:13:34,394 --> 03:13:35,735
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought tonight is...

2738
03:13:37,907 --> 03:13:40,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleep, Soon, CZZ.

2739
03:13:40,788 --> 03:13:41,908
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2740
03:13:42,828 --> 03:13:49,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just peeking at Tumblr for a second, and someone posted a GIF of someone dying during an MRI.

2741
03:13:49,989 --> 03:13:52,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, why would you put that on the internets?

2742
03:13:53,350 --> 03:13:53,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Gross.

2743
03:13:54,270 --> 03:13:58,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, it's all just a scam, but it says that you're... I'll just read what it says.

2744
03:13:58,591 --> 03:14:00,552
[SPEAKER_06]: This is someone dying while having an MRI scan.

2745
03:14:00,572 --> 03:14:05,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you die, your brain releases tons and tons of endorphins that make you feel a range of emotions.

2746
03:14:06,113 --> 03:14:06,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Tragically beautiful.

2747
03:14:09,880 --> 03:14:12,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help it.

2748
03:14:12,041 --> 03:14:13,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I don't have the soundboard up.

2749
03:14:13,962 --> 03:14:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Debbie Downer.

2750
03:14:15,763 --> 03:14:17,444
[SPEAKER_06]: But it means when you die, you die happy.

2751
03:14:18,485 --> 03:14:19,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2752
03:14:19,745 --> 03:14:20,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2753
03:14:20,546 --> 03:14:23,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't you tell a booby joke or something to end the show on a happy note?

2754
03:14:23,728 --> 03:14:24,428
[SPEAKER_06]: They have blue feet.

2755
03:14:28,016 --> 03:14:29,337
[SPEAKER_03]: More positive energy.

2756
03:14:29,357 --> 03:14:30,819
[SPEAKER_06]: What did the boobie say to the tit?

2757
03:14:32,601 --> 03:14:33,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2758
03:14:33,462 --> 03:14:35,585
[SPEAKER_03]: What did the boobie say to the tit, DarkSakura?

2759
03:14:35,725 --> 03:14:36,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Chirp.

2760
03:14:38,989 --> 03:14:39,469
[SPEAKER_03]: They're birds.

2761
03:14:44,093 --> 03:14:44,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

2762
03:14:44,854 --> 03:14:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it.

2763
03:14:45,994 --> 03:14:46,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2764
03:14:46,415 --> 03:14:47,375
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we needed to end on.

2765
03:14:47,795 --> 03:14:50,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody for listening to another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to spread the word about Orange Launch Radio and see more of you guys next week.

2774
03:15:08,889 --> 03:15:09,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, be safe.

2775
03:15:09,930 --> 03:15:10,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be a dick.

2776
03:15:11,411 --> 03:15:11,891
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.
