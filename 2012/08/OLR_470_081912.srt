00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Tonight, August 19th, 2012, we run down the news from Gamescom, the 3DS XL is released,

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:31,680
and the Neo Geo console is set to be released all over again.

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,320
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,400
where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,220
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, for this

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,820
August 19th, 2012, with the 470th episode of our program.

7
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,480
My name is Rob Roberts, I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about everything

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,200
going on in the world of gaming, and then some, with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,760
First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,760
Hi.

11
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
How are you ma'am?

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm sore.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Sore?

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Yes.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,960
What have you been doing that's made you sore?

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Well, hey!

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,880
What kind of girl do you think I am?

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,080
A DDR playing girl?

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Yes, actually.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Oh, okay.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,480
We'll touch on that in a minute.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Alright, fair enough.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,680
Say hello as well to Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Hi.

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
How are you doing, Loki?

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Doing good.

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,400
What food won the, for those that play the home game of betting on what you bring in

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
for food every week, what won this week?

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,440
The Double Western at Carl's Jr., or Hardee's on the East Coast.

30
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
There you go.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,760
Alright, oh, of course, the always present fourth guest on our show is you guys at our

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,520
chat room, live.vognetwork.com, and we'll be reading some of the comments from our chat

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,320
room throughout the night, so be sure to get in there so you can participate with us.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,080
Just the three of us in studio, this is the first show in a little while, it seems like,

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
with no guests.

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
It's a little lonely.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,040
It's a little lonely and sad in here tonight, and I don't know how we're going to top last

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
week's episode.

39
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,420
That was a pretty good episode, so we'll try though.

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,920
We'll bring our best C game tonight.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,160
No, you know what?

42
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,960
We actually have some awesome things tonight that are-

43
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,320
We could point a webcam at my boobs or something, I don't know.

44
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Oh, the webcam's in the other, no, you took the webcam, didn't you?

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,820
I did take it, and it works.

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,880
You confiscated it, so no booby cam tonight.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
No booby cam.

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,960
Well, it's so unfortunate that your Dell million doesn't have a webcam built into it.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Oh, wait, it does.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
That's true.

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,960
I do have my iPad.

52
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
No.

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
And the Ustream app on the iPad.

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,080
And I've made sure that the webcam stuff is disabled on my laptop, because I deleted all

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,400
the Windows shit and have the Linux shit, so.

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,640
All right, in all seriousness, we have some fun stuff going on tonight.

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,000
We have a soundtrack preview going on tonight, which is pretty cool, from the Darksiders

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to Soundtrack.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,920
And this is going to be both for the podcast listeners and the live listeners, thanks to

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
Something Music, S-U-M, Thing, but I'll talk more about that later on, but there's all

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,640
sorts of information on where you can get the soundtrack at our website, vognetwork.com.

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,720
Of course, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com is the website where we tape our show live

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,040
for you kids every Sunday night at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after our

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,040
pal Bobby Black Wolf with his show, The Bobby Black Wolf Show, at 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern,

65
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
every Sunday.

66
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,360
And lots of other great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network as well.

67
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,760
Not just gaming shows, but shows about TV talk, like Critical Myth, and they do some

68
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,280
movies as well, British Invaders, kind of a similar thing, but with a very British twist.

69
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,440
Pod Culture is awesome, and Pod Culture's got something special tomorrow.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,960
They're back with an all-new episode, they've been off for a couple weeks, but they are

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,000
talking to somebody who's publishing a series of books, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,120
to give, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say this, so a little preview, they're actually

73
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,640
doing a giveaway, so be sure to tune in and check that out at Pod Culture.

74
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Lots of other great shows too.

75
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Anime Jam Session, Girls Gone Wild, Hoard House, Hoard House is okay, but the rest of

76
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
the shows are great.

77
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,640
All right, let's see, we usually start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, but

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,880
we usually have a kick-off topic, and I thought I'd bring up something that's a little bit

79
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
recurring.

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Crack!

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,560
What was the first time we talked about crack on the show?

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
No, no.

83
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,240
Two drugs, kids, drugs are bad.

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,200
So okay, y'all know we have a little bit of a history with Kickstarter, and kind of like

85
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,440
talking about that site, and we're not always a fan of a lot of the things we see on Kickstarter,

86
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,240
or at least I should say, I'm not always a fan of a lot of the stuff I see on Kickstarter.

87
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,600
Dark Soccer has not always been a fan of the stuff she sees on Kickstarter.

88
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,040
Loki has contributed way too many Kickstarters.

89
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,800
It wasn't that many.

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
How many?

91
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
How many?

92
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
How many's not that many?

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,800
It's at least five, right?

94
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Six.

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
See?

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Seven, I'm sorry.

97
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,520
All right, well here's the point.

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
I donated to a Kickstarter this week.

99
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,440
I actually finally joined the website.

100
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,720
I signed up for Kickstarter.

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,760
It was to expand the Mantis website.

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
No, no.

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Heck no.

104
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Oh, make that nine.

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Sorry.

106
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Nine Kickstarters?

107
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
Suddenly, this week...

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,800
You know, you can just take that money and give it to me, and I'll put it to better use.

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,760
This week from maybe five to nine?

110
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,200
Well, there was some I forgot.

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,880
I forgot, you know, I forgot about those playing cards.

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
And they're awesome.

113
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
They are.

114
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
Dan was like, wow, that's cool.

115
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,040
I forgot about the Megran thing, which I'm still waiting on.

116
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,240
There's apparently the comic coming too, but you know, it's still coming, and then Shadowrun

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Returns.

118
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Shadowrun Returns would be awesome.

119
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,800
Can't wait for that.

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,920
But yeah, so I actually donated to a Kickstarter this week.

121
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:40,560
I even went so far as to donate $180 to this Kickstarter, $180 to this Kickstarter.

122
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,000
Cue dramatic chipmunk or prairie dog.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,160
There's nothing like a meme from five years ago to lighten the mood.

124
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,580
I gave 180 bucks to the GamerCon Kickstarter, the G-A-Y GamerCon Kickstarter.

125
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,840
I think it's a great idea, and I can totally see where being a startup event, they really

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,480
need the money to be able to reserve the venue and do something big, and it's been great

127
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,600
promotion for them.

128
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,240
And you know, as somebody who's a gamer myself, it's something I want to support.

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,860
So Alan kind of made it known that he wouldn't mind going, and I wouldn't mind going.

130
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,080
So if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do it big.

131
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,820
I don't do anything half-assed.

132
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,840
So I threw down for VIP passes for both Alan and I, which sent me back 180 bucks.

133
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,780
So yeah, there you go.

134
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
I donated to a Kickstarter.

135
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,360
You going to judge me, anybody?

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
Dark Soccer, you want to judge me?

137
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm totally not judging you, but that means I can start my Kickstarters to support me

138
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,000
while I write a book.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,320
I'll give you 50 cents.

140
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
What will that get me?

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
It'll get you a fart.

142
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:51,320
No, but I know there's a lot of people that are like, why does there have to be a GamerCon?

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,240
Does that mean there's going to be a StraightmerCon, and you know, just kind of all this.

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,200
Well Straightmer doesn't have the same ring to it, whereas gamer sounds like-

145
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,600
Heterocon or whatever it is.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
It's not that-

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,660
If I can get the boobies in there, that'd be kind of cool.

148
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Here's the thing-

149
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,660
I bet there is a BoobCon.

150
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
I'm going to look for it.

151
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,660
Here's the thing.

152
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,720
Okay, BoobCon is every other gaming convention, and there'll probably be some BoobCon at GamerCon.

153
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,280
Let's not forget the lesbians.

154
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,560
There is a BoobCon.

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I think that's-

156
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,100
Oh, it's a Facebook utility.

157
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,940
The whole thing is, is that, you know, I like the idea of having this event and to bring

158
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,120
gay gamers together, because I've met a lot of really cool people.

159
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,720
One of my really good friends I met at a gay gamer event in the Bay Area, and we're friends

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
to this day.

161
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,720
My friend Spike, who is one of the co-hosts on the Game Buoy, we met at like one of those

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,280
gay gamer parties, and you know, it's not that straight people are forbidden from coming.

163
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,320
In fact, I'm sure DarkSakura is going to pre-order as soon as she's got them, as soon as she

164
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,520
has her Kickstarter funded, she's going to pre-order a ticket to GamerCon, right?

165
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
I'd go.

166
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Yeah.

167
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,340
I don't know that I'd be able to afford, you know, $90 tickets.

168
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,400
You're not going to be shunned because you have boobies, and you're not going to be shunned-

169
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,160
I'll just wear a shirt that says HAG.

170
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,800
But here's the other thing, is that, you know, obviously, I don't know how far I want to

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,040
go with this controversial topic or whatever, but in the gaming culture, you know, a lot

172
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,600
of times gay guys and ladies have to put up with all this garbage we hear on Xbox Live

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,980
and, you know, FAG, FAG, FAG, and it's not like we're alone, there's a lot of like racist

174
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,020
stuff that happens, there's a lot of like really, really bad things that happen on Xbox

175
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Live.

176
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Why do you think I only play with you guys?

177
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,800
And everything negative usually has some type of connotation to like, oh so-and-so's a fag,

178
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
ugh.

179
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,840
It's because the people that play on Xbox Live, and actually just a lot of people that

180
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,600
play games nowadays online, are very unintelligent and young.

181
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,320
I know that for a fact from the modding community, that I talk to these people directly, and

182
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,360
it's like, can you guys compose an actual sentence without sounding stup- or like, seriously,

183
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,000
can you compose a sentence that actually makes sense, that doesn't have like any sort of

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,880
complete misspellings of everything?

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,360
But here's, here's the other part that I think a lot of people ignore.

186
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,680
And that is that, as a gay guy, there's a lot of judgment that happens in gay culture

187
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
as well.

188
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,560
I know, that might be shocking to you, but sometimes as a gay gamer, I don't wanna s-

189
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,960
I don't wanna sound like, oh poor me, or I've had a tragic life, no, I've had a great life.

190
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,280
But I have faced sometimes, you know, in the gay culture even, people like, oh, you s-

191
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,160
play video games all day?

192
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,040
You mean you don't like, you don't like to, uh-

193
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Accessorize?

194
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,840
You don't like to go to concerts, or you don't listen to such and such artists, or you don't

195
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,480
read such and such blogs, or you know, a lot of those types of things.

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Shun!

197
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Exactly!

198
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,480
I ha- I, I know this might be a thing I'm not supposed to say, but it's true.

199
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,080
I have faced some of that in the gay culture.

200
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,500
So it's tough sometimes, because you don't feel like you fit in column A, you don't feel

201
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:08,960
like you fit in column B. So, I think there- it's, it's really awesome that there's a lot

202
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,460
of people raising their voice, thanks to, you know, the internet, that feel like they

203
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,160
kind of don't fit in these columns, and having a convention to just celebrate.

204
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
We're here!

205
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,560
And it, there's- I don't, I don't think the, the con exists to make a statement, or the

206
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,280
con exists to, uh, further the cause, or whatever.

207
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,440
I think the con exists to have fun, and that's what I plan to do.

208
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm just gonna have, I'm gonna have a gay old time, and gay isn't happy.

209
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
I'm gonna have a gay old time.

210
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,400
It's gonna be a good time.

211
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,560
Well, I mean, the only other equivalent is YowieCon, really.

212
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
And YowieCon exists.

213
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,840
And that's more for girls.

214
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,960
I think GamerCon is just for, for anybody that just wants to have fun.

215
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,280
Sounds- In a supportive environment.

216
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Great.

217
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,680
And besides that, you were talking about columns?

218
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Fuck columns.

219
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,680
That game was shit.

220
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
No.

221
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
No, no, no.

222
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,240
I, I think that the moment we can move past labels and pointing fingers is why, you know,

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,080
when anyone says, well, I have this, or I am this, I'm like, um, you look like you're

224
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,440
a human being to me.

225
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Act like it?

226
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Mm-hmm.

227
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
So, yeah.

228
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
So.

229
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Anyhow.

230
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I mean, this is what I'm just talki- oh, sorry.

231
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
No, go ahead.

232
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,880
I was gonna go to some chat comments, but go ahead.

233
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,080
This is what I was talking about, about people that can't fucking complete sentences.

234
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Okay, this is the guy that I'm talking to right now, I'm working on some Grand Theft

235
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,920
Auto mods, okay?

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,560
Did you, you know, just let her you get it to work, okay, that makes sense.

237
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,120
How about this one?

238
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,360
Should we take thing away?

239
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:51,760
Um, okay, just let me know, because trying to get it by today, um, okay, that is fine,

240
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,040
what do you thi- what do you think it is?

241
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,120
And just let me know when you get it to work.

242
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,520
Oh my fucking god.

243
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,640
How is Babbie formed?

244
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,040
It's like, seriously, it, ugh.

245
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,200
Let me go to some comments from our chat room at, uh, live.vognetwork.com, where we have

246
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,680
plenty of folks in chat participating live with us tonight.

247
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,660
JV Mon wants to know, where is GamerCon anyway?

248
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,280
They haven't picked a venue yet, it's gonna be in San Francisco, they've said that much,

249
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,080
but we don't know what venue, I mean, that could be a lot of different places, that could

250
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,360
be a hotel, they could do it at the Hilton, they could do it at the Moscone Center if

251
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,400
they get enough money, I don't know where they're gonna have it yet, um, so, more to

252
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,920
come on that, but it will be in San Francisco somewhere, uh, Acidic Vamp- which is another

253
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,320
reason why I wanted to go, is that, you know, San Francisco's only a two-hour drive for

254
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,600
me, I could drive in and out every day if I wanted to, but I have some friends in the

255
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,960
city, like Grandpa from Hoard House I could stay with if I wanted to, um, Acidic Vampire

256
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,240
in chat says, to find more gamers, because- G-A-Y-mers, because it's like a needle in

257
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
a haystack sometimes.

258
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,200
Uh, Raginator says, sadly enough, when someone proclaims that they're a gamer to someone,

259
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,280
the other person immediately pictures a fat, balding, middle-aged slob eating Cheetos in

260
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,800
their mom's basement and never goes outside.

261
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Hey, I like Cheetos, just for the record.

262
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Ew!

263
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,160
But ex- but no, I mean, exactly the point, is that, you know, there's kind of these,

264
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,280
like, stereotypes, and it- it's throughout all of our cultures, so.

265
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,000
And speaking of Cheetos, you know what's wrong with Cheetos?

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,320
Is they have those giant Cheetos.

267
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,160
I mean, really, the Chee- the cheese powder to whatever else Cheetos are made out of ratio

268
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,760
is just fucked up by that, I mean.

269
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,440
So Loki, any chance that you would go to gamercon?

270
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,880
Probably not, because I'm not really allowed to travel right now, you know.

271
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,800
So- But what if you told- what if you told the

272
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,080
wife it was a gay gamer convention?

273
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,400
She'd laugh, she would get a kick out of that.

274
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah, she'd probably laugh at that, because- We should- we should try to get a panel, I

275
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
would love that.

276
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,520
Would she let you go if we had a panel?

277
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Perhaps, yeah.

278
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
I think we should.

279
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Totally get us a panel.

280
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,320
We'll see what we can do, I don't know.

281
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
And free tickets.

282
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,600
Alright, moving on.

283
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,380
Let's talk about the types of video games that we have been playing this week, and how

284
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
was your gaming week?

285
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,120
Dark soccer, you hinted at this a minute ago?

286
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,260
I played the ditter.

287
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,040
My leg- okay, this is what happened.

288
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Alright.

289
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,000
That's dance dance revolution for the uninformed.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,920
I, um, was working at this place, and everyone knows I got laid off, but, you know, it was

292
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,640
very, uh, it was an amicable break-up, amicable break-up.

293
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,960
Um, I still got to go to the company picnic, which was at Goffland, on like some corporate

294
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
picnic day.

295
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,200
So, yeah, there were still a bunch of annoying teenagers, but it was okay.

296
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,480
Um, but, you got one of those little bracelets that let you get go-karts and a laser tag,

297
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,840
which I didn't do either, um, and get in the water park, which I didn't do either.

298
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Um, but, uh, we just went in and had a good time, but, um, while we were waiting for lunch

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,200
to be served, I went inside to go play some DDR, because we also got 20 credits on one

300
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
of those little cards.

301
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Um, well, there were already three credits in the DDR, so I'm like, I'll play them all.

302
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,240
It was on four songs.

303
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
So I played 12 songs back to back and decided that I'm going to finish out with Superstar,

304
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,080
because I- dammit, I'm not old, I can still do it, although I did fail Cowgirl, which

305
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,400
is very sad, because that used to be, like, one of my best ones.

306
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Bang badoo bang.

307
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I know.

308
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,600
But, and I made it through that, and by the time I got done, I felt like I needed to throw

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,680
up, because I was hot, and I hadn't done anything strenuous like that in a while.

310
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,760
And that's the point where you realized, I was in my DDR Prime 10 years ago.

311
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,200
When I weighed 30 pounds more than I do now, which is sad.

312
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,120
So anyway, I was- I went and had a good time at lunch, and I felt better once I ate something,

313
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,440
and, you know, had a good time, and my BFF Forever's Becky was there with the boy and

314
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
her hubby.

315
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Hi, they're listening.

316
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Hi, Ro.

317
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Hi, Ro.

318
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
And it was, you know, we had a really good time, and Dan and I played copious amounts

319
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,920
of Tank Tank Tank, and there's this other game, too, that I-

320
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,200
Are you guys going to pick that up on Wii U?

321
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Is it coming out?

322
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Yeah, Tank Tank Tank's going to be one of the launch games for Wii U.

323
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,640
I don't know that we're getting a Wii U, but I fucking want that game, so maybe we will.

324
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,120
Okay, I'm trying to find the name of this game.

325
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,640
Okay, it's a Sega game called Let's Go Island, Lost on the Island of Tropics, and it's a

326
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,760
shooter game where you're on a- Oh, I saw that, yeah.

327
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,020
Yeah, where you're on a boat, and it's one of those quirky little Sega games, of course

328
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:27,600
I loved it immediately, and you play as this girl and the tour guide, and all of a sudden

329
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,880
terrorists are on your boat, and they're shooting sharks and everything, and then they get eaten

330
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,520
by the sharks, and then you're underwater being drug along by the-

331
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,760
You're on a boat, and you're fighting terrorists and sharks?

332
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,320
This game has everything.

333
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
It's great.

334
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,040
When you finish each, the boss of the first level is this huge manga squid, and you also

335
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,160
have to jerk your controller in a certain way to get past these little cut scenes.

336
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,940
It's pretty cute, but-

337
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:55,640
That sounds all sorts of like, how was that game called?

338
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,800
Yeah, well, I totally interrupted that.

339
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
It's one of their gun shooting games that was really awesome that I loved that was on

340
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,120
the Wii, and also in the arcade.

341
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Freaking Sega, of course.

342
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:13,600
Anyway, so when you finish the level, though, it does a compatibility meter to see how compatible

343
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,200
you are, and Dan and I were 60%, but it's also funny when you shoot the same things,

344
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,640
it gives you this twin bonus, and you get little hearts and everything flowing out of

345
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,360
it, but I died at the second stage, and so Dan continued, and he made it a little bit

346
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,640
further, and then when you get less than 10% compatibility, it says you wouldn't sit next

347
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
to him on the bus.

348
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,520
I was like, wow, that's kind of cold.

349
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,320
And then I played more DDR, and Dan played with me, and he's like, I forgot how to play.

350
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,960
I never, ever saw Dan play DDR.

351
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,720
Dan used to play my Dreamcast one with me.

352
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Fun.

353
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,720
He could, the hardest he could do was Dynamite Rave.

354
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,240
Dan was one of those guys who didn't want to admit he played DDR.

355
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,480
But the hardest thing that he could do was Dynamite Rave Easy.

356
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
So I picked that as the last one, because he wanted to play all the old stuff, except

357
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,000
for Burning Heat, which, you know, Gradius.

358
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,920
So we played all the fun stuff, and I kept him alive, and it was just really, we had

359
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,400
a good time, but by the time I got out of the car after we got home, my legs had started

360
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
to cramp up.

361
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I was like, wow, how much jumping and running was I doing?

362
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,440
So I was like, I'm out of practice.

363
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,060
So we actually discussed this.

364
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,640
We're going to hook back up our JPS2 and start playing our DDR games again, because I've

365
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,280
got those dance pads that I got at the thrift store that were like three for six bucks,

366
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,840
and like one of them didn't work.

367
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,100
The other two did.

368
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,840
So we're going to start playing DDR getting home.

369
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Good luck.

370
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Thanks.

371
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
It's all part of the plan.

372
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,140
Now, I got to say, when I went to Golf Land a couple weeks ago, I was, I was depressed.

373
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,620
Everything was, everything was broken, too many people, hot, gross, not fun.

374
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,400
It was clean, shiny, and extra air conditioned.

375
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,440
The only thing I got a kick out of was the gigantic Tetris game.

376
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
I love that.

377
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,360
You can play the giant balls.

378
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,840
I also played more games, more games, because I'm still playing through Mass Effect 2 for

379
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,320
Becky with a Para Themshep and Garrus, totally Garrus.

380
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,760
I'm still playing through Mass Effect 3, which I'm still at the same part that I am, and

381
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,880
every time I load it up, I just get depressed and turn it back off, and I want to play more

382
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
multiplayer next week.

383
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Does it involve Mordin?

384
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
No.

385
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Oh, okay.

386
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
No, um, um, um, I already passed that.

387
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm on Thessia.

388
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
Oh, okay.

389
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Oh yeah.

390
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
That part.

391
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
But this time I'm taking Javok with me and not Garrus.

392
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,960
Garrus gets to stay home and not be depressed.

393
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,200
How considerate of you.

394
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,720
I'm very, very considerate of Turians and their sensitive natures.

395
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,280
Um, I have my fourth 85 in WoW.

396
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Addict.

397
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Dealer.

398
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
How many do you have?

399
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,920
I got my fifth this week.

400
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,040
Well, I got my four in last time.

401
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,480
I now have two druids at 85.

402
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,760
I'm on my way to my second druid, but so now that means I have, uh, in order, Arissa, the

403
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,220
mage, Rebecca Black, the paladin, Garrus, the shadow priest, and Sakurina.

404
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,840
So next in line is probably going to be, um, uh, the troll, a city vampire in our chat

405
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,720
room reminds us Leviathan is coming.

406
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
The DLC for mass.

407
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
I know someone's excited.

408
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Yeah.

409
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Yeah.

410
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I can't wait to check it out.

411
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,720
It's just, why does this all have to hit the same day?

412
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,280
Leviathan Guild Wars two and the big wow patch all hit the same day.

413
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,040
I think that probably 10 bucks.

414
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,040
I think the Vita patch is that day too.

415
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
I don't know.

416
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
We have a story on it later.

417
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,520
I'm not playing Guild Wars.

418
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,560
I want to check it out, but I, at least there's no monthly fee.

419
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,960
I know Guild Wars and one of those things I can kind of look at anytime.

420
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Yeah.

421
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,000
But I mean, I've still got a, I'm probably, to be honest, not going to get, um, the well

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,240
thing right away, except, um, if I ever get paid for one of my projects, maybe I'll buy

423
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,760
it, you know, as a treat to myself.

424
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,880
It's just like while I still got other, other tunes to work on, like what's the point, you

425
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
know?

426
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah.

427
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,000
The thing that I'm excited about for a while is that I know this isn't courthouse, but

428
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm excited that, um, all of the races are going to be available, like from the get go

429
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
for everybody.

430
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Yeah.

431
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
That was, uh, yeah.

432
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
And that's not in our news role tonight.

433
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,820
Cause I was going to save that for courthouse, which is fine.

434
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,520
But yeah, the, the big news about, uh, anybody can play any race except don't expect to play

435
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
a Panda next Tuesday.

436
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,560
Pandas will unlock with Pandaria.

437
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,480
However, you don't have to have Mr. Pandaria to roll a Panda, but you will need to go past

438
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
level 85.

439
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Yeah.

440
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,560
So, but I mean, it's still, I'm probably, cause I mean, I did temp work.

441
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,440
I have enough to buy the game and I'm sure I'll probably get it cause I'm still paying

442
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,760
for the shit till March, uh, tiger claw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says

443
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,520
speaking of wow, I saw that Mr. Pandaria trailer.

444
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,240
The first thing that came on my mind after watching it, a bad-ass version of Kung Fu

445
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Panda.

446
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,840
The trailer was released this week out of games com, the new world of Warcraft trailer.

447
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,280
It looked great.

448
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,340
The, the CGI was beautiful and you know, with all this talk about a world of Warcraft movie

449
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,760
and all this, it's like, just do that for 90 minutes would be great.

450
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,600
Although I have to say overall, I was a little disappointed in the trailer.

451
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,120
The reason why is that I would hope that the cinematic trailer for it would show like a

452
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,680
little bit of everything.

453
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,160
And there's so much beauty in this expansion in the realm of Pandaria and some of these

454
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
new five mans.

455
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,600
They don't really show any of that.

456
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,020
Like I wanted to see a rendered version of the temple, the Jade serpent and some of that

457
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
gorgeous stuff.

458
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,880
Well, I've just been looking at, um, at, uh, data dumps.

459
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,260
So for some of the, the internal stuff, you know, basically people just doing run throughs

460
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,940
of the empty temples and the dungeons and everything.

461
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
So this looks pretty neat.

462
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
Nice.

463
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,940
All right.

464
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,680
Before we turn into an episode of Horde House, let's let you finish up.

465
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
We'll move on to Loki.

466
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,640
Well, um, I'm also very pissed off at all the people nudging me on words with friends

467
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,240
and I'm about ready to delete it.

468
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
Yeah.

469
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm getting that with song pop.

470
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
I'm kind of over song pop now.

471
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,720
Like it was fun for two weeks, but now, now I've moved on to another game.

472
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,360
I, and I can't help it and I'm glad I didn't pay for the game and I'm not paying for any

473
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,160
of it, but I still like draw something.

474
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,160
And the only reason I'm still playing is because I haven't paid for it and I'm not looking

475
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
at any ads.

476
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,380
So I'm all cool.

477
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,240
I have drawn some perverted shit in that game.

478
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,800
All right.

479
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Loki.

480
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,640
Um, let's see.

481
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,240
I played Call of Duty, modern warfare three, a little bit of that and Minecraft, a whole

482
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,000
lot of Minecraft, um, getting bored with it again.

483
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,080
It's just like, I think the problem is I don't have a lot of people to play with and that's

484
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,920
really odd considering there's like so many people that bought the game, but, um, none

485
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,560
of my friends seem to be playing games that, you know, we can join in or whatever.

486
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,440
So I'm playing with my coworker and we're just like the map that we're on, we've kind

487
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
of explored everything.

488
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,500
I got to the point where I'm like, okay, fuck it.

489
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,360
I'm going to go ahead and start duping again because there's still a way you can do stuff.

490
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,840
So I duped a bunch of dynamite and just create a hole and I was like, wow, create a crater

491
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
board still.

492
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,840
It's like, may I interject one thing?

493
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Yeah.

494
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,000
I saw one thing that made me love Minecraft.

495
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,200
It was this video that someone did and lined up explosives, everything that says I love

496
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,000
and when it exploded it said, but that's so mature.

497
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,360
I love it.

498
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
I love that.

499
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,440
That might be cause you know, dark soccer, if you've been listening to previous episodes,

500
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,000
she's not very, she kind of frowns on Minecraft, but I love that.

501
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,720
I love, butts may have cracked the door open a little bit to dark soccer getting on the

502
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,720
right crap.

503
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
It cracked the door.

504
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:55,680
I'm not saying it made me like the game, but it made me laugh like my ass off, like and

505
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,200
that and seeing people making giant pigs and like goombas and Mario and shit.

506
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
That was pretty funny.

507
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,760
You do realize I have a giant pig in my map that I have made.

508
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,680
I was talking about your giant pig.

509
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,600
Anyways, moving on.

510
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,120
I did happen to see like, for example, like something that was more structured to be kind

511
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,640
of fun, like with other people, I watched a kind of a, one of those, we play things

512
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,360
it was with the, machinima, I think they do that.

513
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,600
And it was a bunch of people playing, it's like a, like a survival type game where they

514
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,920
had to go out the store and survive.

515
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,920
They had three torches, a wooden sword, and a couple pork chops.

516
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,960
And just like, okay, last man standing, whoever gets back, you know, the last person to live

517
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,680
has to get back to the, you know, the safe house.

518
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,500
And then, you know, we'll score a point and it's the first person in the seven.

519
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,040
And that was really hilarious.

520
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,600
Like the Minecraft hunger games.

521
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Certainly.

522
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
They have that.

523
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
They have that too.

524
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,720
But this is like, it was sort of like that.

525
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
But that looked like fun.

526
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,880
See, more of the structured stuff with like a lot of people, sounds like a lot of fun

527
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
with Minecraft.

528
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,160
In fact, when we first started playing, when it was like you, me and Bobby and then like

529
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,980
other people joining in, that was fun.

530
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,680
But now when it's just like myself and no one comes in, you know, to these worlds and

531
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,960
stuff, it just gets pretty boring.

532
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
I don't know.

533
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,780
I think that's why I kind of turned away from Minecraft in the first time.

534
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,560
I kind of checked it out.

535
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:36,440
Ironically though, I did also check out another Minecraft-esque game because it was cheap

536
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,740
and it was featured in an article I read.

537
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,200
It was Castle Builder Z.

538
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,040
And Castle Builder Z is on the Xbox Live Indie Games.

539
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,280
It is only a dollar.

540
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,080
Eighty Microsoft points.

541
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,300
So worth checking out for that kind of amount of money.

542
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,400
It's like Minecraft with your avatars, with really crappy looking graphics, I mean even

543
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
like crappier than...

544
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,440
I was like, Minecraft isn't exactly known for its, you know, graphical finesse.

545
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,600
It's like, you know, they made their own textures.

546
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,120
It looks like a bad texture pack on Minecraft.

547
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,960
But you have guns and you can craft weapons and stuff like that.

548
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,080
And it's zombies.

549
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,840
Would guns make you more interested in Minecraft?

550
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
Maybe.

551
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
And there's zombies.

552
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,500
Yeah, I understand there's zombies normally in Minecraft, but these aren't the zombies

553
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,160
that are in the regular Minecraft.

554
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,360
These are like, I'm gonna run at you at full speed and jump in the air and try to kill

555
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,680
you zombies.

556
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,320
And there's a dragon that tries to kill you as well.

557
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,880
It pretty much the whole game is like, very, very...

558
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
It's not...

559
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
I don't know.

560
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
It's kinda scary.

561
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,640
The sound that they have in there kinda sounds like one of those Halloween tapes or CDs and

562
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,320
stuff with all the Halloween spooky sounds.

563
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
But that's pretty much it.

564
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:04,240
And it's just like, I ended up barricading myself into a cave or something because the

565
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,880
first time out I was like, okay crap, you know, this looks like night all the time.

566
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,880
I mean, when it's daytime it's gloomy and lightning outside and when it's nighttime

567
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,800
it's dark but there's tons of shit running at you.

568
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,400
And so the first time I made the mistake of, oh, I forgot to get wood.

569
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Crap.

570
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,200
You know, so I'm like waiting in there.

571
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,120
I'm like, okay, I better go outside and go try to punch a tree real quick and get some

572
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
wood.

573
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Go punch a tree.

574
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Only in Minecraft.

575
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,960
So I did that and then all of a sudden I get bum-rushed by a bunch of fucking zombies.

576
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,860
Or like, I don't even know, they were just something that was snarling and sounding like

577
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,280
a tiger or something but it looked like some sort of monster thing that ran at me.

578
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,960
And so I started firing a pistol at it and I didn't really do anything because I got

579
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,640
rushed from a few other sides at the same time.

580
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,000
And then it's like, okay, that was plain non-normal.

581
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,220
And then when you respawn it kind of respawned me close to where I was and immediately all

582
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,000
those mobsters, all the monsters that were right there just like crushed at me and I

583
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
died again.

584
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,480
I was like, crap, okay, so I got to do this differently.

585
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,280
Anyways, so I finally got it to where I'm like in a cave now and I've mined some stuff

586
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,800
and you start building weapons because you don't really have a whole lot you can build

587
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,440
in it because it is kind of a knockoff of Minecraft but you don't have like beds, you

588
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,160
can't sleep or anything.

589
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,760
And then there's, it always sounds like there's monsters trying to dig their way into your

590
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,400
tunnel and sometimes they somehow manage to get in there and I think on higher difficulties

591
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,320
they can dig through the tunnel and get to you.

592
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Yeah.

593
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,440
Yeah, it's like, it's fucking creepy.

594
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,880
And they're like really silent too until they get up, like I was digging into the wall and

595
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,380
all of a sudden, like I noticed my screen turned red and there's a fucking skeleton

596
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
behind me.

597
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,400
It's just like, it's loud everywhere else but then I would have cried and throw out

598
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,980
the controller.

599
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,960
It's pretty, I think it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.

600
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,560
But yeah, 80 Microsoft points, I mean, it's a buck, come on and just try it.

601
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,760
If you want to try it, you know, if you play Minecraft, it's kind of fun, you know, you'll

602
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,880
get a dollar's worth of entertainment out of it.

603
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,900
And in general, don't forget about indie games.

604
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,160
Don't forget about Xbox indie game.

605
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,560
There's a lot of fun stuff on there.

606
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
It's not bad.

607
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,000
I mean, Castle Miner was one of those series, it was one of like two or three series that

608
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,880
were on indie games that were kind of mimicking Minecraft for a long time before Minecraft

609
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
came out and they still do and they still sell all right.

610
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:31,220
But they're fun in their own right and it's four player co-op and you can play, you know,

611
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,320
online and stuff like that.

612
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,640
So it's worth it for like, I mean, come on, you probably have 80 Microsoft points sitting

613
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,600
in your account that's just leftover from rock band purchases or something like that.

614
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,760
So definitely worth checking out.

615
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,860
I mean, there's tons of indie games on there that we're checking out, but that it was kind

616
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
of fun.

617
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,860
All right.

618
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,600
Well, if you're done with your gaming week, I'll do mine real quick.

619
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,720
Not a lot of new stuff this week.

620
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,800
A lot of the stuff from last week, like sound shapes and World of Warcraft and so forth.

621
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
But I did play two new games.

622
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,280
One of them's a little herpy derpy.

623
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,640
I'll talk about this real quick.

624
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,640
It's an iOS game.

625
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,480
I've been playing it mostly on my iPad.

626
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,460
It's called Puzzle Craft, which might make you think it's Minecraft, but like puzzle,

627
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,460
but it's not.

628
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,720
It's actually nothing like that.

629
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,240
It's one of those free to, well, no, it's not even free to play.

630
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,340
It's 99 cents.

631
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:17,600
But then of course they charge you for all these upgrades in the game, like extra coins

632
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
and stuff.

633
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,280
You don't really have to do it.

634
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,360
The crux of the game is that you're building this town and you get all the materials to

635
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:32,920
either get food or get materials to build things in your town in this whole little match

636
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,880
game where you, like they call it match three in the description, but it's not bejeweled

637
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
at all.

638
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,940
It's like trace the consecutive line of like all the little pieces of grain in the puzzle.

639
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,120
Like try to trace it and then they all disappear and new stuff falls and kind of goes like

640
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
that over and over.

641
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,200
And it's one of those things that's just like so stupid that I'm playing this, but it's

642
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,200
addicting.

643
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,520
It's just cute and you have this little town of villagers and some of them wear chicken

644
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
outfits.

645
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
It's really cute.

646
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
So whatever.

647
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
There's that.

648
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,640
The other game I've been playing a little bit, just a little bit because it just came

649
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,880
out today is New Super Mario Brothers 2 on the 3DS.

650
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,800
I did pick that up today.

651
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
It just came out today, so I haven't had a lot of time to play it, so I can't give it

652
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
a full review.

653
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,040
I'll post something more in depth on vognetwork.com later this week.

654
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Plug plug.

655
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,160
But how similar is it to New Super Mario Brothers?

656
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,800
It's pretty much the same damn game, but is that such a bad thing?

657
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:32,200
Well no, but at the same time it kind of feels a little bit like they didn't put a lot of

658
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,080
effort into it if it's pretty similar.

659
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,160
Well I mean there are some new stuff.

660
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,080
I mean especially with this I kind of think the whole like Mario's after coins.

661
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,920
I think it's it's a little bit corny, but some of the power-ups are neat.

662
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,600
Like I love the one that turns you into giant, although I guess that was in the previous

663
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,640
games too, but I was like ooh giant Mario.

664
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,920
And then you know the ones that have the gold coins where you can kick and it leaves like

665
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,960
a trail of coins and the fireball that makes all the blocks turn into coins.

666
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,600
It was kind of neat.

667
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,600
Really where the game shines, as it usually does, is level design.

668
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,120
I've played a lot of really well designed levels.

669
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,600
Halfway into world one you can, if you find it in the fortress, there's a, I'll give you

670
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
a hint.

671
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,000
You don't want a spoiler, mute your thing for 30 seconds, but here's a hint.

672
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,440
In the very first fortress there's a room that you go in with these green blocks that

673
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,720
spin around.

674
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,680
Look for an exit in that room that's not the main exit.

675
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,840
I'll give you that hint.

676
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,440
And you'll find yourself in the world mushroom world or whatever, which is kind of like I

677
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,200
guess like the secret world.

678
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,360
And the stages get a little harder, but like one of them was like really neat design because

679
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:48,080
the way the blocks were, you had to figure out like how you could fall through the blocks

680
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,160
to get all the coins.

681
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,240
It's kind of hard for me to explain without like showing you a visual, but just like the

682
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,240
way the blocks were, it looked like one solid block, but it's got all these lines in it.

683
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,600
So you had to, I don't know.

684
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,880
3D doesn't really add anything to the game, but that's okay.

685
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,680
I'm totally okay with 3DS games not whoring the crap out of 3D.

686
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:12,000
If you want the 3D stuff, go play Mario 3D Land, which you know did it very well.

687
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,880
But yeah, I liked it so far.

688
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:21,400
You know, I'll probably play it to completion and it's got some interesting street pass

689
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,760
things where you can play a sequence of three random stages and try to get as many coins

690
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,920
as possible.

691
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,520
And then you street pass to somebody else and you get their records, so you can try

692
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,240
to play the same three stages they did, even though it was randomized.

693
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,200
So it's kind of like, I don't know, kind of has that Mario Kart-esque competitive element,

694
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,960
which wasn't in any other Mario game so far.

695
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
So that is something new.

696
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
I'll give it that.

697
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,600
Kind of a little different.

698
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
I will get into this in the show a little later.

699
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,060
They're promising the DLC will be worth it, essentially.

700
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,360
So I'm curious about that, because again, level design is where these games tend to

701
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
shine.

702
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,280
Well, this is all they really need to do since the engine was done a few times.

703
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Yeah.

704
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,260
I mean, I'll be honest in that regard.

705
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:09,820
If I'm going to razz the game, it's that it's really the first Mario game I've played in

706
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,640
a long time where I go, this really isn't original, which I know is weird because Mario

707
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,600
games are essentially all the same mechanic.

708
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
But think about it.

709
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,880
You know, in the original Super Mario Bros. and then there's Mario Brothers 2.

710
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,680
It's like, holy shit, this is totally different.

711
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,760
And then Mario Brothers 3 kind of went back more towards the first one.

712
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,400
But you know, Mario, if it ain't fixed, don't break it.

713
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,440
Mario World was like completely modes.

714
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Yeah.

715
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Yoshi and all this.

716
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
Then Mario 64.

717
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
Oh my God.

718
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
3D.

719
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
Mario Galaxy.

720
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
Oh my God.

721
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
The planets and everything is just different.

722
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,760
It's like the first one in a long time I've played where I'm like, yeah, okay.

723
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,320
It's pretty much the same thing as the last game with some coin grabbing elements.

724
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,720
That's the one bad thing I could really say about it.

725
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,280
Otherwise it's a Mario game.

726
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,260
Like what Super Mario Brothers game has been bad.

727
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,680
I'm not talking about spinoff game.

728
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm not talking about like Mario is missing and all these like spinoff games.

729
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,560
What core Mario Brothers game has been bad?

730
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Just straight up bad.

731
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,480
I don't even think Mario Sunshine you could say was a bad game.

732
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,480
I still think Mario Sunshine was great.

733
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Mario Sunshine.

734
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,480
I mean, yes, it's a formula, but it's a solid fucking formula.

735
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,440
Go with it.

736
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
There you go.

737
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I should go to the chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

738
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Let's see.

739
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,480
Shayna Linko's in chat saying, I'm at a bit over 30K coins so far.

740
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,000
It gives me incentive to keep playing.

741
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,960
Yeah, the back of the box says something about getting a million coins and I guess you get

742
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
something special.

743
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
I don't know.

744
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,040
It's probably just all the levels backwards or something.

745
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,320
StartUpG says the raccoon power up is back.

746
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,460
That is true.

747
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,780
It's not Tanooki Mario anymore like it was in the Wii one or the last, no, the Mario

748
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,780
3D Land at the doogie.

749
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,940
It's just straight up raccoon Mario, just like you remember it in Mario three.

750
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,800
In fact, there's a lot here that's just like you remember it in Mario three.

751
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,880
Like you go to world two.

752
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,040
It's a desert world.

753
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
What a shock.

754
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,800
It's kind of a lot of the same formula.

755
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,560
Well it is the third new Super Mario Brothers game, so maybe it's new Super Mario Brothers.

756
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Maybe it's not that new.

757
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,240
They should just call it well polished Mario Brothers.

758
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,360
Isn't that a little something, you know, it's like really you couldn't have come up with

759
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,100
a better name for the series other than, yeah, it's a new Super Mario Brothers game.

760
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,600
Interesting point from Dark Tetsuya.

761
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,800
Ironically, Mario two's original version, meaning the Japanese version, lost levels

762
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,080
here, right?

763
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,560
Wasn't too different from Super Mario Brothers one.

764
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,720
Just the level layouts and some of the little things they added cranked up the difficulty.

765
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,080
That's a great comparison.

766
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,400
You know, lost levels or Mario two in Japan really wasn't that different from Mario one.

767
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,640
Different graphics, a little different mechanic with Luigi's jumping.

768
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,600
Well, and Mario two that we got wasn't even a Mario game originally.

769
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Right.

770
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
But I'm not talking about that.

771
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,840
I'm not talking about the whole, that whole thing I'm talking about.

772
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah.

773
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,560
Where they say, Oh, how innovative, how different.

774
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,840
It wasn't even a Mario game.

775
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
True, true.

776
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,640
But I mean, go back to the loss levels or Japanese two and one.

777
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,380
That's a very, I mean, I don't think loss levels is a bad game.

778
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,320
It's a really, it's a challenging asshole game.

779
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,580
It is.

780
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,400
And there's some asshole stages in this that I've played so far when you get into those

781
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
special worlds.

782
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,120
So let's see.

783
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:24,060
Tiger claw says the next version would be new, new Super Mario Brothers.

784
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,320
Very new Mario Brothers 2015.

785
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:32,480
Well, you know, what's funny here could be a band themed one because new Super Mario

786
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,720
Brothers, you too, you know, Oh yeah.

787
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
What up?

788
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
G reminds us.

789
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Mario two had the poison mushrooms.

790
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
That was a little different too.

791
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
Okay.

792
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,840
But here's, here's the one tiny concern I have.

793
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,920
If I'm already looking at this game going, all right, it's cool, but it's not very, it's

794
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
not that original.

795
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,340
It's not as original as Nintendo wants you to think it is, but what's going to happen

796
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,020
when that Wii U Mario game comes out because these games are not coming out with a lot

797
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,680
of time apart between them.

798
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,720
What's that Wii U Mario going to bring to the table?

799
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,960
Isn't that going to be the same damn thing again?

800
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
It's the same thing.

801
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,200
But now with the gimmick that, Hey, look, a fifth person, because I don't know about

802
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
you, but I always have about five people in my living room wanting to play the Wii.

803
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,800
Oh wait, no one wants to play the Wii.

804
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Okay.

805
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,280
So five people supposedly in this room playing the Wii U and one person is gonna be like,

806
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,880
Hey, I'm moving the platforms.

807
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,080
Look, I'm, I'm, I'm like, you know, I'm contributing.

808
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,920
It's like almost like that dumb person that you have in your room.

809
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,800
Well, it's like, you know what?

810
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,940
Billy's not going to play the game because he's too stupid.

811
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,000
He's going to keep dying.

812
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,480
So we're going to let him move the platforms up and down because that's all he can handle.

813
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,000
So five people to play this to its full potential.

814
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yes.

815
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,720
This game is going to sell like crazy in Utah.

816
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,640
Go figure.

817
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,900
So it's just, I, if someone even made it, I had to laugh because there was a comment.

818
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,800
It was a developer actually, uh, for those get trying stuff on the Wii U.

819
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,880
And they were saying, all Nintendo is trying to do is sell a, uh, TV size DS.

820
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm like, we've been, he's like, why isn't anybody in the games pressing?

821
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,600
And they're like, we've been fucking saying that for months.

822
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,020
That's all the Wii U is going to be is just a giant DS.

823
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,640
He's all, you know, basically the D or the Wii U game pad works well at a demo kiosk.

824
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,140
But when you actually back it away from the TV, then you have to constantly look down

825
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,520
at your controller and stuff like that too.

826
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,400
It just doesn't really flow well.

827
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,700
Uh, alpha Kananagram in our chat room says sky.

828
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,920
It's going to bring in H fucking D. Okay.

829
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,120
I can respect that and all like I'm, you know, Mario and HD will be fine and all, but let's

830
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,120
be real.

831
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,120
New Super Mario Brothers is not the game I want to see in HD.

832
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,560
F fucking zero is the game I want to see in HD.

833
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Hello.

834
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,840
Or even a new like 3d Mario game would be pretty awesome.

835
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
That would be awesome.

836
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,840
Yeah.

837
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,360
I'm like, that's, it's not exactly the greatest starting point.

838
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:59,120
Can you imagine a Metroid prime in HD imagine like a super Mario world esque game in 3d

839
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,040
like kind of like Zelda ish, you know, big adventure type game.

840
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
That would be fucking awesome.

841
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,120
Not new Super Mario Brothers.

842
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
You.

843
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
All right.

844
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,520
Last comment from chat and then we're going to move on with the show.

845
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,120
Tiger claw says, but by the way, new Super Mario Brothers two, does it take advantage

846
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,160
of the 3d?

847
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,960
How does the 3d look on a 2d plane?

848
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,000
I think I said this a little bit before, but it doesn't really use the 3d a lot.

849
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,280
I mean, it's pretty much the backgrounds on one layer.

850
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,320
I mean, there, there are some subtle effects, but, but that's okay.

851
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,960
I want to, I want to point this out.

852
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,760
Not every 3ds game has to whore the 3d like crazy.

853
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,000
I think this is a good thing.

854
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,920
It's the 3d is subtle and is not a game changer.

855
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,860
If you want a game that whores the 3d, but does it very, very, very well, go play the

856
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:48,120
Mario 3d land, because that was an original Mario game, despite the fact that certainly

857
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,160
it has a lot in common with Mario 64 and all that because the 3d brought some awesome elements

858
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
into it.

859
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,560
That game felt very original, despite the fact it was a formula at the end of the day.

860
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,960
So go figure maybe, maybe sitting next to Mario 3d land.

861
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,600
This game feels a little bit like a step backwards.

862
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I don't know.

863
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
That sounds like a very harsh thing to say.

864
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,120
It makes it sound like I don't like gamers, but you know, cause three land was actually

865
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:18,520
pretty innovative and it was a pretty awesome game.

866
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
I don't know.

867
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,160
New Super Mario Bros, the first one was a pretty awesome game, but it's just, you've

868
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,920
done it now three times and you're going to do it again one more time and you haven't

869
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,160
really changed it up that much.

870
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,600
I mean, it's basically like, cause even before it was like, Hey, look, we created this tech

871
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,120
demo of the, the Miis running around in like this New Super Mario Brothers thing.

872
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,080
And that's, that was the Wii U tech demo.

873
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,680
And I'm like, that's just New Super Mario Brothers, but they have, you know, it was

874
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,800
just a tech demo.

875
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
And then guess what they did?

876
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,760
Cause they did this with all their fucking tech demos.

877
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,120
They turned it into a game.

878
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,640
It's like, Oh my fucking God, you didn't do anything.

879
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:03,280
You just, you just have four, you have four people running around in this game, just like

880
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,680
you can on the Wii version.

881
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,480
Oh, but there's a fifth person that can do shit for some reason.

882
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,120
I'll probably still get a Wii U.

883
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,480
I got problems.

884
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,600
I got problems.

885
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,880
Don't get it at launch.

886
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,000
We'll see.

887
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,320
We'll see.

888
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,080
There's nothing coming.

889
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,080
There's nothing.

890
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,920
Despite everything I'm saying, despite I look, I'm just going to admit it.

891
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,920
Despite everything I'm saying here and now about originality and all that.

892
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,720
The first time I play that New Super Mario Brothers Wii U or whatever in HD, I'm going

893
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,440
to be like, Oh, I want it.

894
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,280
And I'll have it cause I want it.

895
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,560
I'm not planning, I'm not planning on buying one.

896
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,040
I don't, I don't need that system.

897
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,240
I don't play the Wii enough.

898
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm no.

899
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,800
All right, let's move on with some gaming news.

900
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,360
Oh wait, housekeeping, uh, visit us at twitter.com slash O L R or on Facebook, facebook.com

901

00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,800
And of course visit our network that we are affiliated, affiliated with and tape live

903
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,940
at the voice of geeks network or vog network.com I wrote a review of sound shapes so you can

904
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,940
check out.

905
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,940
That's there.

906
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,800
And there's some other, a book review went up last week of Stargate by a, the guy from

907
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,640
critical myth and lots of good stuff on the site.

908
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
So check that out.

909
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,960
Vogue network.com let's get into some gaming news.

910
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,640
Loki just, I guess tons of Sony shit coming out of games com.

911
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,120
Well there's like 20 stories and I'm like, you know what?

912
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
This is do them all.

913
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Let's do them all.

914
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Here you go.

915
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
All kind of tied to each other.

916
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,520
Well it's some non Sony stuff real quick.

917
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,080
Um, there was a game that Capcom kind of brought out of nowhere.

918
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,080
They're calling it kind of the, um, you know, the game of games com.

919
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,080
It was remember me, which was kind of cool.

920
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,000
It had a little bit of like you hack into people's memories.

921
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,920
Um, I always think of that fucking terrible movie with Robert Pattinson that had that

922
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
twist ending.

923
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,480
You remember that it was called remember me?

924
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,940
No cause I never saw it.

925
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,160
So I don't remember it.

926
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
It's terrible.

927
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,480
The twist ending is terrible too.

928
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Yeah.

929
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,280
So it was like the watchdogs of game con.

930
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
It looked pretty awesome.

931
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
Okay.

932
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,120
So it's nice to see there's going to be some of these really big games coming out next

933
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
year.

934
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
That are original.

935
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Our original.

936
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Yes.

937
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
Exactly.

938
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,840
But Sony, Sony was kind of shocking cause they had a press conference during games con

939
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,960
and they actually had like a lot of new IPs that they brought out.

940
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,400
Um, just like, wow, you know, this is amazing.

941
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,820
So one of the games that they showed off was a puppeteer and puppeteer, um, I guess is

942
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:41,560
coming from Sony on or I guess, uh, yeah, Sony online entertainment and it's a new platformer

943
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:50,840
from a Sony Japan studios and it's very, it reminded me of, um, like clockwork night.

944
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:55,140
If you remember that from the Sega Saturn, at least that's what it reminded me of.

945
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:00,220
But it was very unique looking game, like kind of a platformer with this like puppet

946
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,440
looking animation, two different things, but it was pretty cool.

947
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,760
So they have that come out.

948
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,000
Um, another game they had was rain, which kind of reminded me a little bit of limbo.

949
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,360
Um, or even that one game, a loss in shadow that came out from Konami.

950
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,840
It's basically a PlayStation network game that's going to be coming out that features

951
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:26,520
these invisible, like an invisible boy who, um, can only be seen in rain.

952
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,800
Um, so you're wandering around this environment and stuff and solving puzzles based on, uh,

953
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,160
you know, this kind of invisible character, which is a kind of neat.

954
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:41,040
And then I don't know what I should think about this one, but until dawn, it's going

955
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,400
to be a teen horror movie style game that utilizes the move.

956
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,440
That actually sounds kind of awesome.

957
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,680
I hope, I hope this is night trap bad.

958
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,680
That would be awesome.

959
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,800
I think, I think the industry needs a good team, like the annoying parts of night trap,

960
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,120
like the watching the monitors.

961
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,120
Yeah.

962
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,520
The industry needs a game like night trap again.

963
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Let's be real.

964
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,520
Time to resurrect.

965
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,520
Dana Plato.

966
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,640
Apparently you play as seven, um, different teenagers facing unspecified horrors in the

967
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,360
woods, you know, cause that's pretty much every horror movie, um, at least recently.

968
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:23,360
And then, um, one other thing they showed off wonder book again, and I've got to say

969
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,240
this presentation of wonder book was way better than the one that they did at E3.

970
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,140
It was shorter and they showed some new stuff, including not only are they going to have

971
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,720
the whole, you know, uh, book of spells thing, which looked okay in the new trailer, but

972
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:41,000
they have this new, um, they got a licensing with BBC's walking with dinosaurs, which looks

973
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,520
pretty awesome.

974
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:48,640
And digs night crawler, which is kind of a noir fairy tale type game.

975
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,440
You play this worm who's a detective solving fairy tale crimes, kind of sounds almost like

976
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
it could be a book.

977
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,700
You know, I think it might even be a book series, but, um, those will be coming out

978
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,700
later on.

979
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:04,840
Uh, I think right now wonder book is launching with books of spells and that's it.

980
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Wait.

981
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,440
So does this mean you have, you have come full circle, full circle and you are a fan

982
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,440
of wonder book now?

983
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,440
I'm not a fan of it.

984
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,860
No, but it looks, it looks interesting for people that might be into that stuff.

985
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,640
Like I was thinking for, uh, the accounts I deal with, like ideal library chain or you

986
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,880
know, the old libraries in the U S and obviously this type of stuff would be good for them

987
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,340
or people that sell books.

988
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,280
But no, for me personally, no.

989
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,120
You know, what's making a comeback though that ain't got sh or that wonder book ain't

990
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,480
got shit on.

991
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,480
You know what?

992
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,720
You know, what's making a huge comeback.

993
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,400
Brace yourself for it.

994
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,840
Fucking reading rainbow is back.

995
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
Seriously?

996
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
Yeah.

997
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,940
It's like, I think it's like an iOS type thing now.

998
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,320
Like they're making apps out of it where it's not like a show, but it's like, cause LeVar

999
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,440
Burton pimping books better how LeVar Burton associated with it.

1000
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,480
Like, okay, here's the thing.

1001
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,200
Imagine if wonder book instead had been called reading rainbow, we would all be losing our

1002
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
shit over it.

1003
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,280
All they had to do is get LeVar Burton out on stage going, it's the shit guys.

1004
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:24,520
We would have been like, take my money, take it, take it of the intro to this show.

1005
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,000
I love that old logo too.

1006
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,960
It's so eighties and gorgeous.

1007
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:33,020
The only thing that pissed me off about reading rainbow is that the books were always checked

1008
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,160
out at the library.

1009
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,320
You try to go find the books.

1010
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,320
They were always gone.

1011
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:42,340
No one in Alabama reads.

1012
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:48,080
Some other cool stuff, um, before all that they were showing media molecules new game

1013
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:53,300
and it's just fantastically and it's a game called tear away.

1014
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,760
It's on the Vita and basically the whole world kind of looks like paper.

1015
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,360
And so a lot of the stuff you can do in there, you can actually interact with the game.

1016
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,360
So like you can push your finger up on the back of the touch panel and you'll actually

1017
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:11,640
see your finger coming through the screen, which is kind of weird.

1018
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,200
Um, you can literally finger your Vita.

1019
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,960
You can literally finger your via, yes.

1020
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,720
Um, but it's going to utilize the camera in different motion based stuff and it looks

1021
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,120
fantastic cause it's meeting molecule.

1022
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
I mean, come on.

1023
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,120
I'm sorry.

1024
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,920
I'm just so glad the Vita's finally found a use for that back touch pad.

1025
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,720
Now you can watch your finger go up the Vita.

1026
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
Yep.

1027
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,720
Yep.

1028
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,720
You can.

1029
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,760
Uh, they showed off a kill zone mercenary, which is going to be a new first person shooter

1030
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,760
on the Vita.

1031
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,480
Uh, look kind of cool.

1032
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:53,840
They also showed call of duty black ops declassified, which I was very interested in picking it

1033
00:50:53,840 --> 00:51:00,000
up until I realized that it's the guys that made the last resistance game, burning skies

1034
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,320
and that game sucked.

1035
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,960
So probably not going to pick up this call of duty game.

1036
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,880
Can we go back to the fingering thing for a minute?

1037
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,720
A sitting vampire in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says someone's going to put their Dick on

1038
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,720
it.

1039
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,960
So what would happen if you put something besides it?

1040
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,720
Stances like someone hasn't already, what would happen if you put like something else

1041
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,720
on the back touch?

1042
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Here's the thing.

1043
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,920
I don't really understand how it works because they're going to have, it actually is an image

1044
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,920
of your finger.

1045
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,920
It like utilizes the camera.

1046
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,000
Like it captures that.

1047
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,320
So yes, you would see a penis coming up through the back of the screen.

1048
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,000
If you were somehow, or would your penis turn into a finger?

1049
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I don't know.

1050
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
All right.

1051
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,200
Well, I'm assuming it's not, I'm, that's a really big finger.

1052
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
I don't know.

1053
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,200
For some people maybe really small.

1054
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Is that your thumb?

1055
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,760
Cause there's no way for the camera to capture the image of your finger, you know, on that

1056
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,760
back touch panel.

1057
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,120
It just doesn't, it's out of the scope of the lens, but I don't know.

1058
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:02,120
I mean, let's say have you capture your finger, but I think that yes, that is your finger

1059
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,760
look like a sea cucumber.

1060
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,240
This is one of the great mysteries.

1061
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:17,820
What will happen when you put your Dick on the rear touch pad?

1062
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,600
Find out on the next OLR.

1063
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:27,840
You'll make it, you'll make a mess.

1064
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:30,200
I don't want to have that trade in system.

1065
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Yeah.

1066
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:39,000
I played a lot of tear away alone at night.

1067
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,560
There's too much penis.

1068
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:46,680
Speaking of, uh, into windows, I guess ratchet and clank full frontal assault is coming to

1069
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:53,720
the Vita as well.

1070
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,200
You did that on purpose.

1071
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,920
Rob's red.

1072
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,560
Um, full frontal assault.

1073
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,560
Yeah.

1074
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,400
Not only will it be a full frontal assault on the Vita, but also on your PS3 and it's

1075
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,840
going to be one of these games that utilizes this brand new thing to be announced, which

1076
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,940
is the PlayStation cross by, which is awesome.

1077
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
Cross by.

1078
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,120
Basically you purchase a game on the PS3, you get the Vita version for free.

1079
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,120
Fuck.

1080
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah.

1081
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
That's the way you do it.

1082
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
I like, this is a great trend.

1083
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
That sound shape started.

1084
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,120
Exactly.

1085
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,000
Um, another game that's got feature that I hope though, because this was a good point

1086
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,520
that came up when Bobby was talking about this earlier on his show, I want it to not

1087
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,640
just be digital.

1088
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,800
That's my concern is that that would only be the deal if you get it digitally.

1089
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,800
It's going to be digital.

1090
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,760
I thought, Oh, but I'm running out of room on the PS3 and then I'm going to buy a bigger

1091
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:48,680
hardware memory card, that's, that's the trick is that those stinking Vita memory cards are

1092
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:49,680
so expensive.

1093
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,800
They're not that expensive, but did they come down to price finally when they released the,

1094
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,240
the prices of those aren't that expensive.

1095
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,220
I thought it was, no, um, uh, another game that's going to support that as well is going

1096
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,080
to be PlayStation all stars.

1097
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,160
JV Mon reminds us in chat play pinball arcade on the Vita.

1098
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,160
Does that too?

1099
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,160
I have it on my phone.

1100
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
On my phone.

1101
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
I don't need a Vita.

1102
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,840
Um, also another, um, game that's going to support that little big planet.

1103
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,280
The DLC is also cross platform.

1104
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,120
So if you buy, you know, any DLC you have now for a little big planet one and two, we'll

1105
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,540
work with a little big planet Vita and little big planet carding.

1106
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,720
So that's kind of cool.

1107
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,720
That's awesome.

1108
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,720
Yeah.

1109
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,420
A little big planet carding I hope is one of those games too.

1110
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:35,200
I think it is one of the cross buying games, so that's pretty sweet.

1111
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,920
And then, um, PlayStation plus coming to the Vita as well and they're upping the cloud

1112
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,000
storage to one gigabyte.

1113
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,120
So, um, that's pretty sweet.

1114
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Also announced that, um, I guess Europe is going to be getting Red Dead Redemption, um,

1115
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,120
free in September.

1116
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,000
So that's pretty sweet.

1117
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,200
Um, and then also PlayStation mobile.

1118
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,520
They talked a little bit about that and talked about some of the launch games and there was

1119
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,640
a big old trailer on there.

1120
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,920
And one of the things I saw, I remember was Lemmings and I'm like, Holy shit, Lemmings.

1121
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,520
But uh, that's going to be one of the games.

1122
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,800
Uh, also they mentioned that, uh, PlayStation mobile will be compatible with, uh, Sony Xperia

1123
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,680
phones, uh, also Vitas.

1124
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,600
And then they revealed that, uh, the ACES and Wiki pad tablets are going to be getting,

1125
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,960
um, PlayStation mobile as well.

1126
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,800
And they're going to be adding stuff or different devices to that as well.

1127
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,680
So that's pretty cool.

1128
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
That's everything.

1129
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,200
That's a lot of news coming out of Gamescom, but that makes sense because Sony has a pretty

1130
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,320
big presence in Europe.

1131
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,400
They've always done pretty well there ever since the original PlayStation.

1132
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,840
So it's kind of exciting.

1133
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,640
And then I'm assuming there'll be even more Tokyo game show.

1134
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,640
Right?

1135
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,000
Uh, probably that's pretty cool.

1136
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,960
I'm really excited about the whole Vita PlayStation three crossover.

1137
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,560
I'm glad that I'm like, I'm glad that I'll be able to do something with my Vita cause

1138
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:58,800
I haven't really, I'm telling you sound shapes, sound shapes is a great, they should be pushing

1139
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,800
it more.

1140
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,040
It's, it's a great holdover game until they get some more stuff.

1141
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,760
I wonder if that final fantasy 10 remake is going to be, um, buy one, get both because

1142
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,400
they were pimping it for both systems.

1143
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,280
Well it's right now.

1144
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,160
It's been first party that's been doing that.

1145
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
Oh yeah.

1146
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
Yeah.

1147
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Technically it's pretty cool.

1148
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,320
I mean that might get me the, by the PS three version of black ops two, maybe if it was

1149
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,320
like that.

1150
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:26,560
Although, like I said, black ops class of declassified, the fact that it's being done

1151
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,280
by the guys that the resistance brings guys and the trailer just didn't look that great.

1152
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,240
I was just, uh, made me sad.

1153
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
All right.

1154
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:42,000
Well in case you haven't heard the 3ds XL did release today, the suggested retail price

1155
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
$199.99.

1156
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,120
Although there are some deals out there, like I know Fry's electronics was selling it today

1157
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,120
for $179.99.

1158
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,480
Uh, so, you know, look around on the internet and all that stuff to see where you can get

1159
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,480
the best deal.

1160
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,320
Sadly, we don't get the Pikachu version here, uh, but we do get the red version.

1161
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,960
I think there's a red and a blue one that came out here.

1162
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,480
And of course new super Mario brothers two also released today as I already talked about,

1163
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,460
uh, it's kind of the kickoff game for that console.

1164
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,440
So there you go with the 3ds XL.

1165
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
Just a reminder.

1166
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
It is out.

1167
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,920
Get the red one, put a Charmander sticker on it.

1168
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:17,360
My big like concern about getting one of these right now is that again, I think I mentioned

1169
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,920
this last week, they'll just turn around and release like a really beautiful color.

1170
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Like that purple, that purple 3ds is so gorgeous.

1171
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,080
Like I wish that had been the launch color that they would have never had to do another

1172
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,080
color.

1173
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,080
That'd be great.

1174
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,200
So I'm, I'm curious about the XL.

1175
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:37,600
I've heard it's a good system, but at the same time, like I, do I want to pay 200 bucks

1176
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,160
for a new one when I already have one?

1177
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,160
I know.

1178
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,700
I don't think I can justify that really.

1179
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,120
So we'll see.

1180
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,120
But it's out.

1181
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,120
Dark Sakura.

1182
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,600
Well, we do have some news on the corporate front.

1183
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,360
I'll say, I'll, I'll put it in those words.

1184
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,160
Who remembers on live?

1185
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,280
I remember their big booth at E3 and nobody, like nobody thought on live was going to work.

1186
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,160
And then they showed up at E3 and they were like, this works.

1187
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,960
And everybody's like, holy shit, it does work.

1188
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,480
Well, um, right now they're actually, uh, there was something going around about a sort

1189
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,640
of bankruptcy going on.

1190
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,180
And honestly, this article is really hard to read because all the texts has crossed

1191
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,920
over and the HTML is screwed up.

1192
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,640
Well there was so much and there was so much back and forth on this this week.

1193
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,680
Like nobody really has a clear understanding what's going on.

1194
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:25,680
Totally.

1195
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,680
The coding on this is awful.

1196
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,340
Just saying.

1197
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,840
So anyway, basically they were saying that there was an acquisition of their assets by

1198
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,260
a company as a sale.

1199
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,720
Instead it has to do with like, um, bankruptcy protection.

1200
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,240
They have, I believe, been acquired, but in, in kind of a different deal.

1201
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,080
Well, you know what's different about it.

1202
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
They won't say who.

1203
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,080
Yeah.

1204
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,080
That's the big thing.

1205
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,080
It's not weird.

1206
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,600
It sounded to me that they created their, like their own company, like they created

1207
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
another company.

1208
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
I call this OnLive2.

1209
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
Off Dead.

1210
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
Off Dead.

1211
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Let her finish.

1212
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
Let her finish.

1213
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
Cause I want to get into this a little bit.

1214
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,280
Well, here's what the, what the official quote is.

1215
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,640
It's like, we can now confirm the assets of OnLive Incorporated have been acquired into

1216
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,960
a newly formed company and is backed by substantial funding and will continue to operate the online

1217
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,600
game and desktop service, blah, blah, blah, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1218
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:24,320
They are releasing the OnLive employees, um, and I think have put out a call to rehire

1219
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,440
them with the new company, which I mean basically how this worked with the company that I worked

1220
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:34,440
for before when we were sold is that, yeah, we were released from the previous corporation,

1221
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:40,040
but we were hired quote by the new company as, and we know with all of our tenure and

1222
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,520
everything intact.

1223
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,400
So I think that what it's looking like is either they have fully released them or they

1224
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,440
are sending the note out there that, yeah, we want you here.

1225
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,920
We want to keep you around, you know, just maybe trying to get them to reapply through

1226
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,440
different hiring channels or something.

1227
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:03,560
I mean, maybe you want to bring them all and see, you know, if they're loyal to the product.

1228
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,560
I don't know.

1229
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,560
The whole thing is a little weird.

1230
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,200
You know, it was very, like, this is super bizarre.

1231
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,500
You should have seen this play out.

1232
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,220
You should have seen this playing out on Twitter because like, you know, you know, at first

1233
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:15,960
it was OnLive has completely shut down.

1234
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,960
They're bankrupt.

1235
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,960
They're gone.

1236
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,560
You know, and the OnLive Twitter, they've yet to really say anything officially.

1237
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,240
And it was at the point where, like, people were reporting, yeah, we drove down to the

1238
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:30,180
OnLive offices and we see people are walking out of here with boxes and all this stuff.

1239
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:33,560
So clearly the company's not going to hire some people back.

1240
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:38,040
And I think everything's just in this big state of flux right now.

1241
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,720
You know, and it's never good news when people lose their jobs in the gaming industry, and

1242
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,920
this is always tough to talk about.

1243
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:54,040
But I do have to ask the hard question, OnLive kind of, I mean, as a service, it was bringing

1244
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,080
a lot of great things to the table, but the one thing that was really missing was like

1245
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,080
games.

1246
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,560
Like, a lot of the games that it launched with when launching is your first impression

1247
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,620
were years old and kind of old news.

1248
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,960
And sure, they tried to add to that.

1249
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,080
And they did some cool things with the service, like the replays and some of that other stuff

1250
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
they were doing.

1251
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,720
And the desk, I'm sorry, the TV top systems and all that they were doing, they had some

1252
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,720
great ideas.

1253
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,480
But it's like, they just didn't have the games to back it up, and they didn't have the deals

1254
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,160
to back it up like Steam did.

1255
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,180
The coolest thing they had going for it were the hour-long demos that you didn't really

1256
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:28,180
have to download anything.

1257
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,080
You just did it through the cloud.

1258
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,400
But it wasn't, like, they weren't really getting exclusives or, you know, it was tricky.

1259
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,400
It was tricky.

1260
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,360
And I can see where the company's hurting when they're, you know, I think the report

1261
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:44,360
had come out that only several thousand people out of the millions that had signed up were

1262
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,320
only ever on the service at any one time.

1263
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,320
Yeah.

1264
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,600
Sixteen hundred and they had eight thousand servers.

1265
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,000
So that was a lot of unused servers that had to be maintained.

1266
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,960
So I'm just really, I mean, they clearly, someone believes in the product.

1267
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:07,600
I just want to look at Sony bought their biggest competitor, Gaikai, which was a very similar

1268
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,600
sort of thing.

1269
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,560
But Gaikai was kind of doing, they had the whole stuff in the browsers and they were

1270
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,080
getting some deals where the demos were streamed to them like they were kind of trying to push

1271
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,400
the envelope a little more.

1272
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,720
And, you know, now Sony acquired them.

1273
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,720
Yeah.

1274
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,400
Here's the other thing that kind of sucks, too, is basically some of the people were

1275
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,000
offered, you know, consulting arrangements also.

1276
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,840
They said that, you know, they had they asked some of the employees to help smooth the transition

1277
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,080
to the new startup.

1278
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,000
And those people were offered stock options in the new company.

1279
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,040
However, that's those stock are basically worthless unless the company at some point

1280
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:50,960
becomes profitable and, you know, basically it's sold or goes public.

1281
01:02:50,960 --> 01:03:00,880
So you get an IOU, maybe we'll fulfill that money if if we are successful.

1282
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,600
Well, best of luck to the folks that find themselves displaced this week with a whole

1283
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,840
on live stuff.

1284
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,120
I hope they're able to land work quickly somewhere else, as we usually feel in these types of

1285
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
situations.

1286
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,120
So.

1287
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,120
All right.

1288
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,120
Anyhow, if that's it.

1289
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
Yeah.

1290
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,120
Let's move on.

1291
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,800
So speaking of other cloud services, GameStop, they have a cloud streaming service that's

1292
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:29,080
going to be coming to PCs, tablets and Internet TVs.

1293
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:34,320
Of course, you know, you may remember that they acquired Spawn Labs and Impulse last

1294
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,320
year.

1295
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:41,120
And basically it said based on consumer feedback, our success in selling mobile devices and

1296
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:48,680
imminent launch of new consoles, we have decided to move our technology to PC based model.

1297
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:55,560
And, you know, they're going to be only offering it to those devices not going to be coming

1298
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:00,240
to any sort of game consoles in the future, probably because I would be willing to bet

1299
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,920
that those other companies have their own streaming ideas in place.

1300
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,360
Like we know Sony clearly Sony does.

1301
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,760
So maybe Microsoft's kind of going that similar route.

1302
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,060
So it's not that yes, we're not going to put our stuff on those consoles.

1303
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:19,120
More like those console developers don't want us to put our stuff on their consoles.

1304
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:24,180
So, you know, one of the first rumors I read was that Microsoft bought on live, which would

1305
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,000
seem like, no, it's just that's not what happened.

1306
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,460
You know, because sometimes Microsoft buys companies.

1307
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:35,120
But I think in this case, they'll try to just reinvent it and make it better and put their

1308
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,120
own name on it.

1309
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,120
You know what I mean?

1310
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,120
Yeah.

1311
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,880
I don't think if it was like bought by Microsoft, they'd be more, you know, more open about

1312
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,880
it.

1313
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Fair about it.

1314
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
Yeah.

1315
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
We're going to lay everybody off.

1316
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,880
But that was one of the first early.

1317
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,340
You know, you know how Twitter goes, people.

1318
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:52,520
Everybody's everybody's a skeptic and everybody's an analyst.

1319
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,840
So yeah.

1320
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:01,640
So yeah, they're saying, you know, I guess GameStop had proposed a scenario before where

1321
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,740
they were saying that users would need to own a retail copy of a particular game they

1322
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,400
wish to stream from cloud.

1323
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,480
Although now that's not necessarily going to be the case, because if it's not going

1324
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,280
to tie into consoles, then what are they going to own?

1325
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,620
So I don't know.

1326
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,880
It's an interesting idea.

1327
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,880
And I know how they're selling their own tablets and stuff, but it seems like it's such a crowded

1328
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,080
market space out there.

1329
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:29,040
I mean, I know you can trade in games for like these tablets and phones and stuff, but

1330
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,280
why would I want to buy?

1331
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,000
Why would I want to stream games from them?

1332
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That just doesn't.

1333
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I don't know.

1334
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It just doesn't seem appealing to me at all.

1335
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I like the idea of being able to like stream demos and things like that without having

1336
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,440
to download like, like that whole secret world.

1337
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,780
I talked about that a couple of weeks ago, this MMO that I tried out the secret world.

1338
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,600
I had to download a 15 gig thing to try that just to figure out that, you know what, I

1339
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,760
don't really have time for this right now.

1340
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:58,480
It would have been a lot nicer if I could have just streamed it through something like

1341
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,080
this and to make my opinion.

1342
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,040
And there are other MMOs that allow you to do this.

1343
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,120
I'm sorry to be so MMO centric, but you know, it's kind of what comes to mind is it's a

1344
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,640
great, that's a great use for the streaming technology is, is the demos, of course.

1345
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,760
Are you getting your full graphical potential of the game that way?

1346
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,320
I don't know, but yeah, that's another thing.

1347
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:22,560
And then also, you know, with some of these devices, um, you know, not everybody's upgraded

1348
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,720
their wireless network, so you may be running wireless G and that's going to throttle you

1349
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:32,360
a little bit and, um, or you know, you have to be connected to the wifi for the stuff

1350
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,360
to work.

1351
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:39,760
Uh, for most part, I just, I, my tablet has a weird tendency to cut in and out of the

1352
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,760
wifi too.

1353
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,840
Like I'll be connected to wifi and then like once every 15 minutes, it just drops for 15

1354
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,840
seconds.

1355
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,840
And that'll kill your game.

1356
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,960
If I'm trying to stream gamings off that don't like dealing with GameStop is kind of where

1357
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,960
it's at there.

1358
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,960
Yeah, that's a good point.

1359
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,640
They will find a way to take the shrink wrap off those digital downloads before I purchase

1360
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,640
them.

1361
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:04,020
I, I just know it's going to happen, but all right, well, this is a game that, uh, maybe

1362
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,120
some of you will be streaming through a console later unconfirmed, but I don't know.

1363
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,120
It's a big game.

1364
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:14,040
Uh, Tekken tag tournament two, uh, you excited about this?

1365
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,240
There's some more information that came out about this from game com, uh, games com, excuse

1366
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,560
me, Tekken tag tournament two, it will support 3d so you can have, you know, 3d fighting

1367
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,040
and kicking and all that 3d can be switched on or off.

1368
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,560
The depth can be adjusted to whatever it is that you like on there.

1369
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,840
There's also something called Tekken tunes where you can make your own custom soundtrack

1370
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:36,860
by importing your own CDs or MP3s or whatever.

1371
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:41,440
There's also fight lab, which is a way that beginners can learn the play mechanics.

1372
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,280
There's a robot fighter named combat and you will practice your techniques on that in order

1373
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,880
to get through the fight lab.

1374
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,380
I also noticed there's like a design, a character mode, like they have a little kitty girl here

1375
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,840
that's been made in the fighter mode, which seems to be a big thing in the Namco games

1376
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,840
lately.

1377
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
I like that's what soul caliber is all about.

1378
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,880
Now I want the ability to make a Tekken three gin.

1379
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:05,460
Um, yeah, so there you go.

1380
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,480
Some of the new stuff coming in Tekken tag tournament two, I'm sure you're going to be

1381
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,480
picking this up right there.

1382
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:15,120
Well, if I have money now, I'm the one who's not working at this table.

1383
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:18,400
Some moves, just, you know, some moves in this whole create a mode thing.

1384
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,080
They have to be unlocked in the game.

1385
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:26,920
So like if you want to, uh, get an, uh, if you want to get the Phoenix smash from Paul,

1386
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,600
you have to get an S rank in order to get that.

1387
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,920
So interesting or cheap or cheap.

1388
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,240
So Tekken tag tournament two coming soon, dark soccer.

1389
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,680
Well in other news, you know what?

1390
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,980
I kind of want to play the sad trombone for this Rob, because this is how I feel looking

1391
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,980
this over.

1392
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:52,720
Oh, we can arrange that, but well, you know, and you're, you're, you're going to know why

1393
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,720
I went at the moment.

1394
01:08:53,720 --> 01:09:04,840
I say the game, final fantasy 14, well, um, basically they're, uh, they have this thing

1395
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:10,520
called a realm reborn, which is, uh, the relaunch of final fantasy 14.

1396
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:17,280
Um, and, uh, there's an interview with, um, Naoki Yoshida, um, who is saying that losing

1397
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:22,800
your fans trust is an easy thing to do and regaining it is very hard.

1398
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,880
They, um, really think that they're going to be able to, uh, regain the fans trust by

1399
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,140
rebuilding final fantasy 14.

1400
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:33,760
And they want that to be where they launch it from, say, Hey, this is great.

1401
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,060
What's 15 and 16 going to be like, well, first of all, I'm like, stop numbering them.

1402
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,920
They won't be online MMOs.

1403
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,920
Let's hope.

1404
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:45,840
Um, he's quoted as saying over a long time, we'll try to regain their trust, but it is

1405
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:51,440
something we as a company must put effort into long term, but they, they're admitting

1406
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,000
that they're probably not going to get it back with just the one game.

1407
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:02,080
So right now, um, a realm reborn is in, uh, alpha it's a beta testing is going to be going

1408
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:08,440
on later in the year and the PlayStation three group will be invited to join in on the beta.

1409
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,760
So, um, another thing that he pointed out is that in the entire history of the final

1410
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,720
fantasy, uh, series, there has not been one that failed, which is why they're not giving

1411
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,920
up on 14.

1412
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,360
You know, there's a lot of people that respond to that by saying, what about 13, but 13 wasn't,

1413
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,160
why would they wouldn't have made 13 two if 13 was a failure.

1414
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:33,440
Some people just straight up didn't like 13, which, you know, I can get the reasons why

1415
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,760
people weren't into 13.

1416
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,960
I liked it an awful lot.

1417
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,200
If you didn't like it, it doesn't mean something failed.

1418
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,200
Exactly.

1419
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,360
Very good point.

1420
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,360
Very good point, internet.

1421
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,400
It just means that you don't like it.

1422
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,560
Other people do shut up, get over it, but don't take it.

1423
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,560
This is okay.

1424
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:49,000
I have to read a minute.

1425
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,960
It pisses me off when I say I don't like something and someone else immediately says, Oh, well

1426
01:10:53,960 --> 01:11:00,680
I do, you're wrong or will I do as if I'm wrong or vice versa.

1427
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:06,200
One person liking something or disliking something that you do not is not a personal reflection

1428
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,200
on you.

1429
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:14,600
Oh, person of very small willpower and self-worth, you know, end of rant.

1430
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,560
But we can all agree final fantasy 14 was bad, right?

1431
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,560
We can, we can all agree on that.

1432
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,560
I didn't play it.

1433
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,560
I actually can't tell you if it was bad or not.

1434
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,560
It probably was.

1435
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,560
I haven't played it, but from what I heard, I'm just trying to make a joke.

1436
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,520
Obviously somebody's paying for it out there.

1437
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,840
They wouldn't have any servers running.

1438
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,800
I mean, I'm sure there's people that probably like it.

1439
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,360
There are people who are like, I don't have anything else better to do.

1440
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,200
I feel like our chat room at live.vognetwork.com has suddenly become a support group.

1441
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,360
Break Man says some of us like Final Fantasy 13.

1442
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,360
JV Mon says, I like 13.

1443
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,200
Stan says, Hey, I liked 13.

1444
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,280
I didn't like 12.

1445
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,520
I liked what I played of it.

1446
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
I just got a little bored.

1447
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,000
Dungeon Buster says 13 was still commercially successful.

1448
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,200
Kitsune says, I liked Final Fantasy 13 too.

1449
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,760
Didn't like dash two as much just because of that ending.

1450
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:07,280
But I mean, it's, it's the whole thing where it's like, I really don't know why people

1451
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,280
do this.

1452
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:12,040
I mean, it's probably a little shortsighted of me to say it's because someone has low

1453
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:17,640
self esteem or thinks that everything that people are talking about is about them.

1454
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:20,200
Maybe a little ego instead, who knows?

1455
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:25,880
But just because someone doesn't like something that you do, don't take it as a personal offense

1456
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,880
the other way around.

1457
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,880
It has no reflection on you as a person.

1458
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,960
Uh, JV Mon in chat says, I dislike Final Fantasy seven, but respect other people's opinions

1459
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,080
who differ from my own.

1460
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,440
A model citizen.

1461
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,440
Yes.

1462
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:45,560
Uh, RDG Singe says, I like Duke Nukem forever.

1463
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,380
You were entitled to like it.

1464
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:49,680
You were entitled to like it.

1465
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:54,480
I personally think that it was, um, what's a good description?

1466
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:03,280
A festering pile of shit, but, um, I love 10 and 10 too.

1467
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,280
I'm sorry.

1468
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:07,320
Breakman says, stop talking about my low self esteem.

1469
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,320
How dare you?

1470
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,380
Wait, what are we talking about?

1471
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:14,240
It's just, I don't know what it is.

1472
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:19,200
It's a big internet thing, definitely, but it's also a human thing for people to want

1473
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,360
everyone to like the same things that they do or hate the same things that they do and

1474
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:29,280
poopoo anybody else who doesn't think the way I do, dammit politics, which is a little

1475
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:33,720
bit more important, but it's video games are the most important thing.

1476
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,800
What are you talking about?

1477
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:43,520
But it's at the same time as like, okay, fun, fun of fantasy 14.

1478
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,300
They're looking at it as a failure fiscally.

1479
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,560
It's probably a failure for them.

1480
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,340
It's probably pulling in just enough money to keep a couple of servers up.

1481
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,340
It is.

1482
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,640
It is a little bit unprecedented when it, no matter what your personal opinion is on

1483
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,000
14, if you think we're too hard on it or what it is, it is unprecedented for a game company

1484
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,600
to come out and apologize for a game.

1485
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,600
Yes.

1486
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,360
And they are taking steps to fix it.

1487
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,740
They clearly believe that there's something with that product that's worth salvaging.

1488
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,880
And for all the people out there, like what brought me to this point, regardless in that

1489
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:20,760
say 13 was a failure fiscally, financially, I'm sorry, that's what I mean.

1490
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,760
Was it a failure?

1491
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,900
No, it made them buckets of money.

1492
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:30,880
Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, for example, I don't like F zero, but

1493
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,480
I respect that it is a great game.

1494
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,480
Just not a racing game.

1495
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,880
I like, well, you are entitled to your wrong opinion.

1496
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,480
Shut up.

1497
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,480
Now go sit in the corner.

1498
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,520
Well, here's me.

1499
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,440
I don't like strategy games.

1500
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,320
Couldn't sit through Warcraft to play it.

1501
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,040
Love World of Warcraft.

1502
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:54,480
It's just the third time, fourth, fourth, fourth because I played with each expansion

1503
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:55,960
until I liked it.

1504
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:02,360
Um, but I mean, I love the universe, hate the first series of games, you know, it's

1505
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,280
just has to personal preference.

1506
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,340
I notoriously can't stand Final Fantasy eight and it's not the story that bothers me.

1507
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,340
It's fucking boring.

1508
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,880
It's that fucking fighting system ruined.

1509
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,880
I know.

1510
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:17,760
Well, I love the story so much by the time I got to the third disc, bore for reals, but

1511
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,600
the whole point is, is that take personal opinion out of the equation and look at it

1512
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,600
for what it is.

1513
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,820
How much money did it make?

1514
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:28,240
How big of a player base does it have?

1515
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:30,420
That determines in the terms.

1516
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,280
That's what the stockholders are looking at.

1517
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,280
Exactly.

1518
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,400
That determines right there if something is a failure as a product or not.

1519
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:42,080
Now for everyone who bought Final Fantasy 13 and hate it, they still got the money.

1520
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,080
They, they like it.

1521
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,080
Sorry.

1522
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,320
They still got your money at one and the story, but when you've got an ongoing product that

1523
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,200
people are going to play, play, pay a subscription for, that's a different story and for that

1524
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,200
you have to deliver month after month.

1525
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,140
All right, well let's travel around the world and check out what possibly controversial

1526
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,320
new releases are coming out this week.

1527
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,760
I don't really know if there's anything controversial, but we'll see.

1528
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,800
Let's start in the U S Loki is going to be short.

1529
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,720
There's fall of Cybertron, PS3 and 360.

1530
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,720
That's it.

1531
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,720
Dang.

1532
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,180
Well, we did just have a system launch today and a big Nintendo game, so it's not technically

1533
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,180
new system.

1534
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:23,480
It's about as new as like, say, you know, new Super Mario brothers two.

1535
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,780
There's some big PC games in a couple of weeks too.

1536
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,520
So that's, that's, that's that.

1537
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,520
All right.

1538
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,520
Uh, let's go to Japan.

1539
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,080
Uh, Japan's looking a little bit empty this week as well on the Xbox 360 there is the

1540
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,320
Witcher two assassins of Kings enhanced edition.

1541
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,740
I don't know what's enhanced about that, but that's on the 360 this week.

1542
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:46,160
That's the only thing on the, um, 360 in Japan.

1543
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,000
Otherwise on the PlayStation three, no more heroes.

1544
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,560
Red zone edition gets the best treatments.

1545
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,200
That means a price reduction.

1546
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,360
Also I don't know what this is.

1547
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,760
It's a, a hybrid disc.

1548
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,000
I think this is a game and an anime.

1549
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,160
It's Rene no Lagrange, Kamogawa days, and it's the game and the anime.

1550
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,160
Yeah.

1551
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,160
Cool.

1552
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,600
And that's kind of something we see on the PlayStation three happened a little bit is

1553
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,960
that you have the game slash movie or whatever it was a PlayStation network game in the movie.

1554
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,960
Yeah.

1555
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,200
So, uh, seeing that a little bit more and more, the VITA has got a little bit going

1556
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,240
on this week in Japan.

1557
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,040
We have next revolution.

1558
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,260
There's a couple of different versions.

1559
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:25,360
There's talk and she can, and then Joe who a security specialist, she can, and then another

1560
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:30,640
game coming out on the VITA as well called Tokushu Hodobu comes out.

1561
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,000
That is all on the 23rd of August.

1562
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,040
Now, I will say this next week, cause a lot of people are going to be excited about this

1563
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:37,440
on the VITA.

1564
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,560
Maybe dark soccer, even I don't have a VITA.

1565
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,120
Maybe you'll have to go on for Hatsune Miku project diva F. You're not a project diva

1566
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
fan.

1567
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,120
I thought you were.

1568
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,360
I am, but I don't have a VITA.

1569
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,360
So what does it matter?

1570
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:56,000
Well, you can get in Japan on the 30th, you can get a VITA Hatsune Miku limited edition.

1571
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:02,720
Well, let the people who actually have jobs and money get one for me.

1572
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,880
You should sell Etsy's to fund your VITA.

1573
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,320
What the fuck would I make on Etsy?

1574
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,320
Anger.

1575
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,960
I'm selling my rage.

1576
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,560
You get an MP3 of me going fuck.

1577
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,240
You can record people's voicemail messages.

1578
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,020
Yeah, you could set up, you could set up their voicemail.

1579
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,600

1632
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,800
I just need another copy of it sometimes

1633
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,560
it's about finding the hidden gems there

1634
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,920
you go all right first though a couple

1635
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,080
more stories for you guys Loki all right

1636
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,520
so there was some announcements regarding

1637
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,480
origin it's coming to Mac because you

1638
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,600
know they have games on the Mac so of

1639
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,120
course it would so of course Peter Moore

1640
01:20:58,120 --> 01:20:59,840
announced that you know during gamescom

1641
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,800
it's going to be coming to a few

1642
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,160
different platforms including smart TVs

1643
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:08,560
the Mac Android and Facebook and they're

1644
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,640
also going to be you know adding some

1645
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,520
new features including free-to-play

1646
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,960
gaming which is I think where the

1647
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,080
Facebook and Android comes into play and

1648
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:25,800
achievements hoorah hooray now you can

1649
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,760
play broken games of Mass Effect 3 on

1650
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,520
the Mac I guess it doesn't necessarily

1651
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,960
mean the games are coming out on those

1652
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,440
systems but origin will be there you

1653
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,200
know origin cannot I this this boggles

1654
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:39,080
my mind if Alan and I want to play our

1655
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,480
two friends at the same house in the Bay

1656
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,040
Area we can't do it origin can't handle

1657
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,040
two people in one place versus two in

1658
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,280
another place we can do two on one or

1659
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,680
them two against what we can't do two

1660
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,720
on two it is not possible in origin

1661
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:58,000
setup really really I bet steam can

1662
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,480
handle that it probably to be fair we

1663
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,360
haven't tried but I don't see why it

1664
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,640
wouldn't work I've played some I I've

1665
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,880
never really had a game that failed

1666
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,520
miserably playing it through steam like

1667
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,840
I had a great sieve five match not that

1668
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:13,480
long ago borderlands is through game spy

1669
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:15,400
so that's a little different I don't I

1670
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,360
wouldn't measure that so whatever all

1671
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,560
right well speaking of underappreciated

1672
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,920
classics the neo geo remember the neo

1673
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,880
geo yeah I've looked at one the other

1674
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,680
day you've got one in your house right

1675
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,160
to actually those others are expensive

1676
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,960
have a neo geo and a neo see you know

1677
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,080
how Dan got his neo geo huh he traded a

1678
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,360
Sega CD for it wow well you might have

1679
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,000
to make room on the shelf for this it's

1680
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,920
the neo geo X gold that's right it's a

1681
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,080
new system is in now there were rumors

1682
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,560
about this before that this is coming

1683
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,200
but it is confirmed the neo geo X gold

1684
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:56,880
is a thing it's a $200 thing hey neo

1685
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,320
geos were never known for being cheap

1686
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,040
right now the cool thing is though even

1687
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,600
for being a $200 system it does come

1688
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,840
with a bunch of pre-installed games

1689
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,880
these games used to be like $200 apiece

1690
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,280
if you remember such classics like art

1691
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,840
of fighting to magician Lord metal slug

1692
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:15,560
baseball stars to fatal fury and fatal

1693
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,480
fury special king of fighters 95 samurai

1694
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,640
showdown 2 king of the monsters all this

1695
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,160
is built in so it's pretty those games

1696
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,920
already there's a lot of I mean and I'm

1697
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,560
only reading part of the list so there's

1698
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,640
a good looks like about 20 games or so

1699
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:30,400
that are installed I noticed though I

1700
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,600
don't see bust a move on this list I

1701
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,440
don't see or you know puzzle these

1702
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,800
everyone to call these are all SNK games

1703
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,080
that was tied oh good point good point

1704
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:42,360
well anyhow there is also this I guess

1705
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,680
here's the weird thing it is a handheld

1706
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,240
so it's like it's a handheld system but

1707
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,840
it's also I guess you can plug it into a

1708
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,160
docking station and then it's a TV thing

1709
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,760
too that's kind of cool I got to say

1710
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,320
yeah it's a docking station that's a

1711
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,680
video out that's pretty cool that my

1712
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,800
dingoo does the same thing and was a

1713
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,840
whole hell lot cheaper and yeah I I

1714
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,600
think it's kind of cool but I don't

1715
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,280
$200 is a steep price to pay for

1716
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,720
nostalgia especially you can purchase

1717
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:18,560
like one of those like 48 and 160 and

1718
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,720
one neo geo used by the games on your

1719
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:26,120
geo arcade carts and get super gun for

1720
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,320
way fucking cheaper that I have a super

1721
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,000
gun it's like an all-in-one card thing

1722
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,560
that literally plugs into neo geo

1723
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,240
controllers it's pinned out for that and

1724
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:41,240
I have a 16 one cart so nope not gonna

1725
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,600
buy yeah I don't know I this thing would

1726
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,280
have to be really something special in

1727
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,520
order to get me to buy I will say though

1728
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,400
they the the little joystick they have

1729
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,880
with it is like a mock replica those you

1730
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,440
know those things are rock-solid those

1731
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,120
controllers of the four buttons so it's

1732
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,320
it's a nice controller I will say that

1733
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:03,400
your love that I love them honestly

1734
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,640
made playing all these games because

1735
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,840
it's the arcade experience yeah I'll

1736
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,920
give it that that's pretty cool to

time when the neo geo was you know more

1743
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,240

is the classic game of the week

1753
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,360
troubleshooter anyone remember this

1754
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:55,160
game no it came out on the Sega Genesis

1755
01:25:55,160 --> 01:26:00,520
it has awesome music play a little bit

1756
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,680
you

1757
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,680
assassination

1758
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,680
anyway in Japan it was known as battle

1759
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,560
mania and it's a scrolling shooter by

1760
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:18,440
Victor hi that came out in 1992 and the

1761
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,920
only reason I really I had I can say I

1762
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,680
played this game is I had a friend who

1763
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,240
had a copy so just we'll leave that there

1764
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,840
because I didn't have a genesis when I

1765
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:32,240
was in high school and the game is a real

1766
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,440
basically just makes fun of itself the

1767
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,600
whole time you play as a girl named

1768
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,960
Madison who is a combat operative who

1769
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,720
has to rescue a prince that has been

1770
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,120
taken hostage and she goes around with

1771
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:48,520
her partner crystal now basically you

1772
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,760
play as Madison and Chris was kind of

1773
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:53,560
attached to her but it's really way I

1774
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,640
can describe their positioning and

1775
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,400
crystal always points backwards but you

1776
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,720
can flip her to point in the front and

1777
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,120
she's invulnerable to enemy fire the

1778
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,360
only one who has the hitbox is Madison

1779
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,960
here playing as and crystal is only if

1780
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:15,360
affected if Madison dies so basically

1781
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,120
you have a special weapon that helps you

1782
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,640
during combat and like I said you can

1783
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,800
flip back and forth we can flip your

1784
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,320
partner back and forth that you are

1785
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:27,680
always facing to the right and you've

1786
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:29,240
got different power-ups and it's funny

1787
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:32,200
when when you get a power-up she goes

1788
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:35,680
thank you like that and they make a

1789
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,840
little noises when they get hurt and

1790
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,680
everything a little bubble comes up this

1791
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,920
is ouch it's so cute but it didn't

1792
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,680
really have like a life system you

1793
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,840
stocked at hit points by getting life up

1794
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:51,520
icons and now it often had a sequel in

1795
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,000
Japan called battle mania a diagonal now

1796
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,920
we're going to move forward into what

1797
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,800
makes this game special and I'm talking

1798
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,000
more about battle mania is that it's

1799
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,200
kind of slow-paced it has this sort of

1800
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,120
like I said the weird play you know

1801
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:15,040
playing style in it but basically Owen

1802
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,400
in Japan they were called mania and

1803
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,280
Maria sorry they basically go down and

1804
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:24,880
shoot weird machines and it had some

1805
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,480
really fun stuff thrown in like they had

1806
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:34,880
an issue in the game now this was

1807
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,280
because the group they were working with

1808
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,520
which which was a studio Uchuu Tetsujin

1809
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,920
which is also called studio space iron

1810
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,960
man did not like that Victor Kai worked

1811
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:50,560
with Super Famicom so they had an

1812
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,520
interesting little easter egg through

1813
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,120
into the game where if you press start

1814
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:58,120
right and see on the second controller

1815
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:01,000
the two heroines in the game will shoot

1816
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,200
past the Sega logo and you will see

1817
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:05,160
Madison jumping up and down on the Super

1818
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:09,640
Famicom just bounce bounce bounce bounce

1819
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:16,480
when the U.S. does what Nintendo yeah it's

1820
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:21,680
not in the English version so uh so

1821
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:26,640
basically as things went along this was

1822
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,120
you know going into the sequel the

1823
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:32,880
battle mania die angel it had mushrooms

1824
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:38,920
come out that were part of the power-ups

1825
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:43,760
and it had a fleet of well guys it looked

1826
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,440
like Cape Mario that you had to shoot

1827
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:53,080
down there was also just a bunch of

1828
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,560
stuff that was going on with this it was

1829
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,160
and there's a an official picture that

1830
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,840
came out where it shows the girls

1831
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:07,880
playing volleyball with a super with a

1832
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:12,200
Super Famicom and a hammer and then in

1833
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,200
the game say gaga you remember that one

1834
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,200
right we have to basically you're trying

1835
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,840
to save Sega from financial ruin well

1836
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:22,320
they get helped in the end of the game

1837
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,640
by a bunch of characters from their

1838
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:28,760
games and outcome the two ladies from

1839
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,040
battle mania so definitely the game

1840
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:36,480
itself is definitely a big poop on

1841
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,720
Nintendo but also it's just really fun I

1842
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:42,560
mean it's a fun little shooter so this

1843
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,160
is a game that I would love to have a

1844
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,600
copy of either the u.s. one of the

1845
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:50,960
Japanese one so I would just be giddy if

1846
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,640
I had this game unfortunately I haven't

1847
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:57,800
seen it since I was in high school

1848
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,440

that too I liked it yeah it's nice and

1889
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,560
some folks in chat there dungeon buster

1890
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,160
says at live.vognetwork.com says I

1891
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,600
thought Kidd did a great job in the

1892
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,680
Darksiders to stuff there's a base theme

1893
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,560
in this that runs in this one that runs

1894
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:50,800
into other pieces so there you go so

1895
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,160
alright we're going to get back into the

1896
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,800
show with some rapid-fire news some

1897
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,200
quick news stories here and we'll start

1898
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,840
it off with Loki alright so the Vita is

1899
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:05,280
getting some new firmware soon version

1900
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:08,400
1.8 and this is kind of cool because one

1901
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,600
of the complaints about the Vita before

1902
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,520
were with the visually impaired having

1903
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,960
trouble accessing stuff on the Vita

1904
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,120
because there was no button controls on

1905
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,600
the home screen well that's going to

1906
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,020
change now that there will be button

1907
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,640
controls on the home screen ability use

1908
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,200
the directional pad and stuff to

1909
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:29,520
navigate those screens and no longer we

1910
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,640
have to use just the touchpad and then

1911
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,280
also they're going to add I guess some

1912
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,960
different options for video including

1913
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,000
fast rewind fast forward and variable

1914
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,400
speeds also you can import playlists

1915
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,760
from PlayStation 3 or iTunes for playing

1916
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,520
music and the web browser now supports

1917
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,200
rear touch for scrolling and zooming

1918
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:56,120
also I guess there's going to be a new

1919
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:59,520
cross controller icon in the remote play

1920
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,320
for the cross controller supporting

1921
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:08,200
games and then other tweaks I'm sure so

1922
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,080
that's pretty cool and then black ops

1923
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,200
2 some more details came out during

1924
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,280
gamescom which actually makes me pretty

1925
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:17,320
excited about first things first they're

1926
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:20,440
going to be adding some new customization

1927
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,960
options as opposed to the way they've

1928
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,120
kind of done things for the last god I

1929
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,600
don't even know how many games as far as

1930
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,360
custom classes go you basically get you

1931
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,720
know primary weapon secondary weapon you

1932
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,440
know your three perks and you know a

1933
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,840
lethal grenade and support grenade and

1934
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,680
stuff like that killstreaks now it's

1935
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,760
going to basically be you get ten points

1936
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,320
you get to spend those ten points

1937
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,200
however you want so if you want to go in

1938
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,800
and say fuck it I want to run into with

1939
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,800
just a knife you can do that you can

1940
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,040
have like five perks or hey I want to

1941
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:55,240
have you know a ton of ammo and you know

1942
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:57,120
no perks or I want to have this and that

1943
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:59,000
you can change it however you want that's

1944
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,480
kind of cool so that's something that

1945
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,680
they're adding in there also league play

1946
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:05,720
is going to be added in as well as the

1947
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:09,720
option to do live streams of your

1948
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,120
gameplay so you can have live streams

1949
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,200
and you can also do shoutcasts of like

1950
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,280
commentary so you can have commentary

1951
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:17,680
going over the whole thing as well that's

1952
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,440
built into the goddamn game that's

1953
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,640
interesting yes some people harnessing

1954
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:23,080
the types of things we see on like you

1955
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:24,480
stream and twitch TV and all that

1956
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,840
interesting yes so that's pretty cool and

1957
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:29,280
then there's also a rumor that black ops

1958
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,760
twos heading to the Wii U according to a

1959
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,720
QA testers resume who was on LinkedIn I'm

1960
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:38,000
just going to make it easy for you it's

1961
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,320
not a fucking rumor it's coming on the

1962
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:41,200
wheel I mean I've been seeing it for

1963
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,560
weeks now so it is coming on the wheel I

1964
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,960
know because I've seen the UPC and other

1965
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,040
things but yes it duh I mean come on it's

1966
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,600
gonna be a simple port of the other

1967
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,160
games and you know Treyarch supports the

1968
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,880
Wii so why not come out well speaking of

1969
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,160
the Wii U spot pass is apparently going

1970
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,840
to be a feature of the Wii U this again

1971
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,360
really strikes me as a type of duh but

1972
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:05,600
it is going around the internet this

1973
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,200
week that I guess it's kind of the new

1974
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,480
version of Wii Connect 24 which you know

1975
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:11,520
remember that was a thing that your Wii

1976
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,120
was always on but it's not really it's

1977
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,560
not used as well as it could be spot

1978
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,760
pass a little better on the DS so

1979
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:19,200
hopefully they're gonna implement that

1980
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,360
more and more through the Nintendo

1981
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,680
platforms this is all coming from a

1982
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:24,960
photo of a Wii U development kit that

1983
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,280
the Wii U will have the spot pass

1984
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,680
feature I mean come on of course and it

1985
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,200
if they're smart they'll do a lot of the

1986
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,520
stuff between the 3ds and the Wii U that

1987
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,100
was happening between the DS and the Wii

1988
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:36,520
with the demos and so of course they're

1989
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,560
gonna have spot pass I mean it is a it

1990
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:43,520
is a DS right now on the TV screen

1991
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,280
essentially alright well other Nintendo

1992
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:48,200
news Team Ninja I remember they made

1993
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:50,720
Metroid other M which you know was kind

1994
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,520
of met with mixed mixed reaction not

1995
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,880
everybody was into it I thought it was

1996
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:55,600
pretty I thought it was pretty good but

1997
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,720
you know not nothing is yet to top Super

1998
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,240
Metroid for me you know nothing's even

1999
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,840
really come close honestly what about a

2000
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:05,420
fusion um close but still doesn't top it

2001
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:07,560
the closest thing I would say would be

2002
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,240
the Metroid zero zero mission was

2003
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,160
probably the close that's what I'm

2004
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,040
thinking of how's on the Game Boy

2005
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:14,880
Advance you were thinking of the other

2006
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,920
Game Boy Advance one was Metroid fusion

2007
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:21,120
ah anyway team ninjas yosuke hayashi

2008
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,200
says that they are still close to

2009
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,840
Nintendo and the designer Yoshio

2010
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,000
Sakamoto apparently they are both

2011
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,880
director they were both directors of

2012
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,400
Metroid other M on the Wii and according

2013
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,100
to Hayashi team ninja wants to work with

2014
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:36,520
Nintendo on another Metroid title here's

2015
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,920
a quote unfortunately Metroid is kind of

2016
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,560
out of our meaning team ninjas league as

2017
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,360
it's Nintendo's game but we're still in

2018
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:44,920
close touch with so co-creator

2019
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,840
Sakamoto-san so we want to do something

2020
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,680
with him moving forward definitely it

2021
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,200
really depends on what he wants to do

2022
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,440
with the game first so you know kind of

2023
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:54,800
like a peace offering there I mean but

2024
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,520
again at the end of the day if Metroid

2025
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:57,840
other M didn't sell which I don't

2026
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,720
believe it did sell up to expectations I

2027
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,560
don't know what the future is going to

2028
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,400
hold for Metroid but I can't they

2029
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:04,720
totally screwed up with Samus in that

2030
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,720
game I I wouldn't believe though that

2031
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,320
they would just let Metroid go away but

2032
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,760
then again stranger things have happened

2033
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,880
I hope not I hope not the full track

2034
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,840

riff in another song I'm sure he does I

2127
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:36,560

seriously dubstep technus says that's

2142
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:15,660
not dubstep let's see Stan says that

2143
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,440
sounds like gay club music five years

2144
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,440
ago black wolf says the dubstep song we

2145
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,280
have in rotation is okay the Skyrim to

2146
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:25,000
the knee SSJ 100 Matt says that's pretty

2147
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,200
good

2148
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,600
that's how she was sitting vampire

2149
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,560
actually said it always reminds me of

2150
01:48:33,560 --> 01:48:35,840
downtown Julie Brown whoa whoa whoa whoa

2151
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,960
whoa whoa whoa whoa miss her speaking of

2152
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,480
dubstep have you seen the new trailer

2153
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:42,400

2154
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:45,240
oh is it all dubstep if no it's not all

2155
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,720
this of the day that reminded me of it

2156
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,960
because you know they had the first

2157
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:49,500
trailer they were making fun of the

2158

is all right let's move on with more

2198
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:05,840
rapid-fire news dark Sakura well um

2199
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,760
we've got a fan project that's called

2200
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:12,400
Megaman day in the limelight to sorry

2201
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,640
there's apparently a sequel it's done by

2202
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,000
the people that did mushroom kingdom

2203
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,920
fusion it's a rearranged version of

2204
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,960
Megaman 3 but instead of playing what

2205
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:24,760
tiger class as searching for car alarm

2206
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:54,680
dubstep I found this okay so anyway

2207
01:51:54,680 --> 01:51:56,560
you play through on the stages of Megaman

2208
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,640
3 but you play as the robot masters for

2209
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,920
Megaman 2 so it looks like it's pretty

2210
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,440
fun and I think I'm going to be grabbing

2211
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:10,280

man nana nana nana with extra n versus

2217
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,520
machine so it's six players against

2218
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,800
doppelgangers so you have to fight the

2219
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,000
robot versions of them and you get

2220
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000

2274
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:04,240

2279
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:17,360

2334
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:36,080
you'll never use anything else there was

2335
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:41,080
oh in the issue of Fornax um as far as

2336
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:44,640
others that I really really like I like

2337
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:49,040
the bells in Proteus that I like the

2338
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,720
word blaster where I have no idea what

2339
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,280
it's saying I can only read like some of

2340
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,240
it but it's like I don't know what you're

2341
01:57:55,240 --> 01:57:57,840
saying but die I love I love the

2342
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:04,160
Proteus power-ups a whole bunch and oh

2343
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:07,160
yeah cotton where she gets the willow

2344
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:10,160
she goes we know just I just like it

2345
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:13,880
because that's all she says so Loki um

2346
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:17,120
well there's a few I have some actually

2347
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:18,680
from games I haven't played a couple

2348
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:20,880
from red faction they had mr. toots which

2349
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,560
was a unicorn that fired rainbows out of

2350
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:26,200
its ass that amazing it was a weapon in

2351
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,720
the game oh there was that showed up in

2352
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:31,320
like videos online too right yeah they

2353
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:33,160
did a viral video Freddie Wong I remember

2354
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,240
you covering that yeah I was a Freddie

2355
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,640
Wong thing yeah anyways then the ostrich

2356
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:39,920
hammer from red faction also and then

2357
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,000
for stuff that I actually have played

2358
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,920
fuzzy from you know Super Mario World 2

2359
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:49,280
that wasn't really a power-up but that's

2360
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,160
actually a good answer I like that

2361
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:54,720
memorable and then actually a sort of a

2362
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:59,000
power-up from it was actually in a bunch

2363
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,120
of Capcom games but like one I remember

2364
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,880
is Captain Commando where you would hop

2365
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,360
into like the mechs and like you know

2366
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,600
punch and blow things up and catch

2367
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:10,080
things on fire remember how all the old

2368
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,320
Capcom games had that little symbol that

2369
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:13,640
like showed up in every game that was

2370
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,160
always like an uber power-up like it was

2371
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,480
in every game I can't remember what was

2372
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,200
called you remember that little symbol

2373
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:22,640
like a little mm-hmm somebody I do

2374
01:59:22,640 --> 01:59:24,440
also they'll have to second the purple

2375
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,000
laser and riding because it's always

2376
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,280
what I use was a purple laser anything

2377
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:30,480
else lucky that's it oh there's one more

2378
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,240
I can add huh actually your your shield

2379
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:39,000
thing in our type the added on option

2380
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,200
that you could shoot either from your

2381
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:42,760
butt or from the front that was always a

2382
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,840
cool thing I'm gonna go super duper old

2383
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:47,680
school I think one of the best power-ups

2384
01:59:47,680 --> 01:59:49,520
ever was the hammer in Donkey Kong

2385
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,600
because the little song the little

2386
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,040
animation of the hammer going up and

2387
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,040
down was really funny to me so I always

2388
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,400
love the hammer in the original Donkey

2389
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,280
Kong and then the power brick in Mario

2390
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,800
Brothers because I love I'm not talking

2391
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,000
Super Mario Brothers but an old-school

2392
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,720
Mario Brothers I loved that game I still

2393
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:09,080
do it's one of my favorite like everyone

2394
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,040
that's one of it yeah you just knock

2395
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:12,680
everyone on their ass and it was it is

2396
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:14,120
cool to the power bricks kind of come

2397
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,720
back in the later Mario would be awesome

2398
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:17,800
hmm is you know how we have Smash

2399
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:19,680
Brothers guess Smash Brothers of old

2400
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:22,280
retro arcade games like all that would

2401
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:23,840
be those characters that would be very

2402
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:27,400
cool I slightly old-school but like the

2403
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,600
first thing that came to my mind

2404
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:32,000
honestly the ripple gun from life force

2405
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,000
yes that was the best one I love that

2406
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:36,600
power-up like sometimes I even though

2407
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,000
it wasn't that great of a gun like I

2408
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,680
would get it just cuz it's cool I'm team

2409
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,720
laser over here and exactly the laser

2410
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:43,640
was the the more effective power-up at

2411
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,880
the ripple was just cool and I really

2412
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:48,440
think the best power-up like ever were

2413
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:50,520
the options in the Gradius games in any

2414
02:00:50,520 --> 02:00:52,840
of those option yeah those are great

2415
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,560
power-ups you have too much speed up

2416
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,800
though and you'd be dead right um you

2417
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,520
know well another one actually since I

2418
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:01,080
mentioned our type is the I don't know

2419
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:02,280
if it's called the ripple gun in our

2420
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,480
type but it's like a dual red and blue

2421
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:07,400
that forms this big swirl as it goes

2422
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:08,920
across you've got or something yeah some

2423
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,160
kind of wave gun but that's just thought

2424
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:12,160
that one was pretty triggers in our

2425
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:13,920
chat room says a street can I don't know

2426
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,240
if that was the name of it that thing

2427
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:18,240
I'm trying to think of where that's a

2428
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:20,120
capcom thing that was in the like it

2429
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:22,360
was in 1942 and it was in bionic commando

2430
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:26,480
and which um one other one I would name

2431
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,680
power-up that was awesome you know I'm

2432
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,560
gonna go to Super Metroid right I'm

2433
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:32,480
gonna say the very end of the game when

2434
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,240
you have that laser that just blows

2435
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,600
through everything like the rainbow

2436
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,880
laser that just cuts through everything

2437
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:38,440
there was just something really epic

2438
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,000
about that moment when you had that beam

2439
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,600
as you were fighting mother brain and

2440
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:43,240
there's awesome there is one other thing

2441
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:45,320
okay I know it's a game I've actually

2442
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:48,200

that hadoken in Megaman X that was

2462
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:32,800
pretty cool yeah even even in general

2463
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:36,160
the hadoken kind of changed gaming in a

2464
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,280
way like I don't know if you'd call that

2465
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,040
a power-up so much as a power move but

2466
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:42,280
think about it reuse fireball in

2467
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:45,000
Street Fighter kind of changed gaming in

2468
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,200
many ways I think it did I don't can I

2469
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:49,480
don't can you really did I don't as it

2470
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:51,040
in a games annoy me is it but that's all

2471
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:54,640
you hear all game all right anyhow

2472
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:56,040
that's it for frugal question of the

2473
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,320
week let's move on with some more news

2474
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,400
we'll get to the mailbag if use Twitter

2475
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,160
topic Skype all that good stuff in just

2476
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:04,840
a little bit but first Loki man valve is

2477
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:07,560
getting into all sorts of crazy shit you

2478
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:08,760
know first they're you know they have

2479
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:10,480
their game service and then now they're

2480
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,680
you know putting other software now

2481
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:17,600
they're making documentaries yes valve

2482
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:20,880
has documentaries that are coming out

2483
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:23,400
now and the first one is based on an

2484
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:26,520
upcoming defense of the agents or

2485
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,840
ancients agents that'd be a whole

2486
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:32,280
another game defense of the ancients

2487
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:35,400
documentary and they're I guess

2488
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,200
following people are trying to go pro

2489
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,680
and win a million dollars in a

2490
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:40,800
tournament it makes sense things are

2491
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,320
going this way when that whole indie

2492
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:44,360
game the movie did I'm assuming it did

2493
02:03:44,360 --> 02:03:46,280
fairly well on steam I saw people

2494
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:47,920
talking about it and I would imagine

2495
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,080
they did sort of have a documentary in

2496
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:54,400
iPad form with the portal to the final

2497
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,240
days oh yeah did it wasn't wasn't that

2498
02:03:56,240 --> 02:03:58,000
like a contracted thing though where

2499
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,160
yeah because like Jeff Keeley put that

2500
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,800
all together at least supervised it I'm

2501
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,600
sure he didn't do it all himself but you

2502
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:05,800
know supervised that whole thing where

2503
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,240
yeah because they did they did the

2504
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:09,200
portal but wasn't there one that was the

2505
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:12,040
last days of all there was another game

2506
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:15,400
that had one was it another valve game

2507
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:16,800
actually didn't they do one for Mass

2508
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:19,720
Effect 3 they did they did do last days

2509
02:04:19,720 --> 02:04:21,440
of Mass Effect 3 and last days of portal

2510
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,760
and I there was one other I don't care I

2511
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,440
just want to see an animated team

2512
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:26,520
fortress 2 movie that would be fucking

2513
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,880
amazing fans can make them now well I

2514
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,280
didn't market them through steam it'd be

2515
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:34,360
crazy I still want to see if let's see a

2516
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:36,160
future-length animated movie because

2517
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:38,120
their shit is pretty awesome well there

2518
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:40,920
you got record Ralph coming I doubt team

2519
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:43,440
fortress characters are in it but they

2520
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:47,760
should be why not all right moving on to

2521
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,440
Nintendo I reference this a little bit

2522
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,560
earlier in the show but I wanted to go

2523
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:52,720
into depth on this a little bit because

2524
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:54,120
I'm sure Loki will have an opinion on

2525
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:56,520
this Nintendo is promising that their

2526
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:59,680
DLC will not leave users feel cheated

2527
02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:02,560
or deceived this is a crew according to

2528
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,360
Satoru Iwata of course is Nintendo

2529
02:05:04,360 --> 02:05:06,040
present the president of Nintendo

2530
02:05:06,040 --> 02:05:07,600
because you know Nintendo is just now

2531
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:12,120
getting into DLC what it's 2012 and DLC

2532
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:13,600
has been prevalent since what about oh

2533
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,280
six oh seven when well they're just now

2534
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:18,160
getting an HD to some mean Nintendo is

2535
02:05:18,160 --> 02:05:21,320
finally getting into DLC and here's what

2536
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:23,640
they said and one thing into excuse me

2537
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:25,440
what he said and one thing Nintendo is

2538
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,640
determined as a company policy what we

2539
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:29,360
are not going to do is create a full

2540
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,200
game and then say let's hold this back

2541
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:34,160
for DLC that's not our plan we're

2542
02:05:34,160 --> 02:05:35,920
definitely not doing that it's an

2543
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:37,600
extreme example but I think there are

2544
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,240
examples of games where you get that

2545
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,600
initial purchase the very core part of

2546
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:43,440
the game and everything else around it

2547
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:45,120
is all DLC that's all a matter of

2548
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:46,920
opinion that's some subtle Capcom

2549
02:05:46,920 --> 02:05:49,120
shading that that's all that well that

2550
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,760
is but that's also a matter of opinion

2551
02:05:50,760 --> 02:05:52,280
because Capcom I'm sure in their defense

2552
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:54,420
would say that Street Fighter cross

2553
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:56,040
Tekken was a full game and that these

2554
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:58,160
additional characters are you know that

2555
02:05:58,160 --> 02:05:59,800
just that they're additional but the

2556
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:01,200
rest of the internet called them out on

2557
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:03,160
that bullshit yeah it's on it's on disk

2558
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:05,320
it's paid unlock content and there's

2559
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:06,880
even like there's one story I didn't

2560
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,160
talk about it was sleeping dogs how they

2561
02:06:09,160 --> 02:06:10,600
oh yeah we have six months planned of

2562
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:13,080
DLC it's all paid unlock stuff but to be

2563
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:15,640
fair that is a game where you don't

2564
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,160
really need that stuff it's just

2565
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:19,320
costumes and I don't think there's any

2566
02:06:19,320 --> 02:06:21,280
additional missions or maybe but it's

2567
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,200
mostly costumes one quick other

2568
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,000
statement here so our goal is to create

2569
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,040
DLC in such a way the consumers do not

2570
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,720
feel they have been cheated or deceived

2571
02:06:28,720 --> 02:06:30,400
now I believe there are people out there

2572
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:33,400
readers who have are worried about that

2573
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,880
I think it's a weird translation there

2574
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,640
and we just want to ensure them that we

2575
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:38,640
have in mind and want them to know that

2576
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:41,280
that's not what we are planning on doing

2577
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,080
so Nintendo planning and doing are two

2578
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:47,400
different things we're not sorry I'm

2579
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:51,440
doing it but you know it well you know

2580
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,200
it's not just a water that said this

2581
02:06:53,200 --> 02:06:54,960
because I remember distinctly in that

2582
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,920
3ds little press conference thing not

2583
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:58,320
the one for me three but the one that

2584
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,680
came out a little later where they

2585
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:01,120
spotlighted the games again it was like

2586
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,560
a one of those Nintendo Direct things

2587
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,880
that had Reggie and some of those guys

2588
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:07,320
from Nintendo in it he specifically said

2589
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:10,320
we're gonna have DLC for New Super Mario

2590
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:11,520
Brothers 2 but I want to assure

2591
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:14,960
everybody it's additional content we

2592
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,800
have a finished game first I mean they

2593
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,200
they really went out of their way to

2594
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:21,840
stress it's not something like that

2595
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,520
you're gonna have to have it is truly

2596
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,200
something extra the designers are

2597
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:29,760
working on we'll see what do you think

2598
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,360
Nintendo DLC I don't really know what

2599
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:33,560
the thing yeah cuz we haven't seen any

2600
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:36,440
examples yet I just think that New Super

2601
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,560
Mario Bros 2 is gonna be the first

2602
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:41,480
example of first party DLC anyway I just

2603
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:43,440
don't know if it's gonna I mean I would

2604
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,840
be I was always hoping that like you

2605
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,960
know excite truck you know hey all we

2606
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,800
need is DLC with new levels that's it

2607
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,680
just add new levels in I'll be happy of

2608
02:07:54,680 --> 02:07:56,080
course that never happened and then we

2609
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:58,520
got a crappy sequel but you know the

2610
02:07:58,520 --> 02:08:00,240
Mario Kart same thing people with that

2611
02:08:00,240 --> 02:08:02,280
just add new level my problem with Mario

2612
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,440
Kart and this has been the case with it

2613
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,560
will be all old levels a lot of yes

2614
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:09,280
seriously that's the thing is you've

2615
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,280
released these old levels in every

2616
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,320
single Mario Kart it was cool the first

2617
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:14,560
time that you did it it's like hey

2618
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:16,320
that's kind of neat you know this this

2619
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:19,120
old Mario Kart levels in 3d now or it's

2620
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,320
in like you know the polygons and stuff

2621
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:24,200
now it's getting a little old it's it's

2622
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:27,040
getting a little tiresome just maybe do

2623
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:28,500
a Mario Kart game that didn't have the

2624
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:31,440
old tracks in it just a thought maybe

2625
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:34,080
instead of coming out with four circuits

2626
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,480
you just don't have the retro search I

2627
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,200
don't mind I don't mind the half half

2628
02:08:38,200 --> 02:08:40,120
new half returning stuff I don't mind it

2629
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:42,040
but it's for me here it is it's all

2630
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,340
about this the price is right it is all

2631
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:46,760
about the cost because like what do you

2632
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:48,400
think would be a fair price to charge

2633
02:08:48,400 --> 02:08:51,360
for let's say Nintendo were to put out

2634
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:53,880
five new tracks like a new circuit of

2635
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:56,120
five new tracks what would that be worth

2636
02:08:56,120 --> 02:08:57,920
to you as DLC what would you pay for

2637
02:08:57,920 --> 02:08:59,520
that depends what sir I mean if it's old

2638
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:01,440
really say all new let's say it's all new

2639
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:05,320
I'd say like five bucks really yeah I

2640
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,960
wouldn't want to see it more than $2.99

2641
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:08,960
maybe I'm just a few really good tracks

2642
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:10,880
it just it would all depend on me you

2643
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,480
know but or like Mario Mario 2 coin rush

2644
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:16,440
levels three stages that I wouldn't buy

2645
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:18,320
yeah I don't know I don't know like it's

2646
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,640
really about the price is Nintendo gonna

2647
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:24,620
get the price right I don't know we'll

2648
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:26,760
see

2649
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:29,080
chiggers in our chat room at live dog

2650
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:31,040
network com says Mario Kart level editor

2651
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,440
and share please but then they wouldn't

2652
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,840
be able to charge you for DLC if they do

2653
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:37,800
that they have a Mario Kart level editor

2654
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:40,560
now on the Wii and there is some not

2655
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,340
official though is it now but there's

2656
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:43,840
some way you can do it with SD cards

2657
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,280
where you can load custom tracks on

2658
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:48,920
there same with the 3ds or not the 3ds

2659
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:51,400
yeah was it New Super Mario Rose on the

2660
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:52,700
Wii same thing with that you can do

2661
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:54,700
custom levels in that somehow I should

2662
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:57,120
say this though you know because some

2663
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:59,240
people say well if Mario Kart added that

2664
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:00,500
in then they wouldn't be able to sell

2665
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,600
DLC not necessarily the case look at

2666
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:03,860
something like little big planet does

2667
02:10:03,860 --> 02:10:05,600
this very well you know big planet does

2668
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:08,560
great that reminds me there was a ROM

2669
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,720
hack for New Super Mario Brothers on the

2670
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:12,960
DS that was New Super Mario Bros 3 and

2671
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,680
it had a lot of really cool levels and

2672
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:16,560
stuff in it that would be kind of cool

2673
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:18,040
to compare that to the New Super Mario

2674
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:23,680
Brothers 2 now to see you know how you

2675
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:26,720
know how better one is than the other

2676
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:28,400
because I think that one had some really

2677
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,560
unique ideas that they do with it I

2678
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,920
don't know if we're gonna see that in a

2679
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:34,480
level design you know I don't know if a

2680
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,840
lot of those people are thinking that

2681
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:38,160
far outside the box like some of the ROM

2682
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:41,880
hackers do we shall see let's move on

2683
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:44,440
for now Dark Sakura with some more news

2684
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:48,580
well we do have something else from

2685
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:51,920
valve well I'm sure you're familiar with

2686
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,160
the perpetual testing initiative that

2687
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:56,800
was the in-game portal to editor I play

2688
02:10:56,800 --> 02:10:58,000
a few other things someone's actually

2689
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,720
even gone and tried to recreate the

2690
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:03,360
entire first portal using nothing but at

2691
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:05,160
least the puzzles and everything using

2692
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:08,560
nothing but the in-game editor well now

2693
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:10,880
they have a patch that's going to be an

2694
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:14,320
update for that to let you do co-op that

2695
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:17,240
the co-op test chambers and you also

2696
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:19,400
have another option that's a quick play

2697
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,520
feature so that you can see the top

2698
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,400
rated user maps for each category it's

2699
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,640
gonna like I said free and it's also

2700
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:31,440
gonna come with a 75% off portal to

2701
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,440
vouchers that you can share the game

2702
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:37,640
with friend not bad huh no it's not bad

2703
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:41,880
at all I love you steam I love you so I

2704
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:44,700
can get a friend portal to whether they

2705
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:47,960
want it or not they want it they want it

2706
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:49,640
who wouldn't want portal to it's great I

2707
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:50,920
would think everybody should have it by

2708
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:53,560
now with all them steam sales I know

2709
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:57,640
right so this is kind of shocking during

2710
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:01,440
gamescom apparently some early builds of

2711
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:04,280
the game divinity were stolen out of the

2712
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:06,760
booth they literally picked up pcs and

2713
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:10,200
ran out of the building and somehow not

2714
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:14,960
didn't get caught how does that trend

2715
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,880
because how does that even happen we've

2716
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:18,280
heard about this happening at PAX and

2717
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:21,040
everything it's like I could see I could

2718
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:22,560
see it like if it was for whatever

2719
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:25,760
reason on like a a disc or something you

2720
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,200
know popping the disc out point in your

2721
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:28,880
pocket and run out of the well something

2722
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:29,920
like that happened at the last packs

2723
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:31,480
didn't it do we do we report on that or

2724
02:12:31,480 --> 02:12:33,440
somebody had got it on like copied it to

2725
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,600
a USB drive or something and ran yeah I

2726
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:38,400
was it was I forget what game was but

2727
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:41,800
yeah I do remember that hmm but anyways

2728
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:45,160
so apparently the two games divinity

2729
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,640
dragon commander and divinity original

2730
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:51,400
sin have been stolen from Larry learning

2731
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:54,960
studios and they've actually posted a

2732
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:58,080
reward of $5,000 for anybody that can

2733
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:02,240
you know point fingers at who took them

2734
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:05,240
it was breach was the game that was

2735
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:11,480
stolen at PAX oh I'm sorry yeah it's just

2736
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:15,480
weird I'm surprised apparently you know

2737
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:17,280
they were using backup PC so there's no

2738
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,040
issues with new actual code being so

2739
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,680
yeah only make sense you back up that

2740
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:23,120
stuff is the only copy of the code that

2741
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:24,640
we have here yeah wouldn't be too ah

2742
02:13:24,640 --> 02:13:28,280
shit but still still shitty that they

2743
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:30,840
have to you know plan that well I mean

2744
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:32,600
I mean back which is but it's shitty if

2745
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:34,040
somebody stole in the first place shit I

2746
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:35,720
mean come on it's gotta be on security

2747
02:13:35,720 --> 02:13:37,720
cameras you're gonna notice someone hug

2748
02:13:37,720 --> 02:13:41,000
you know how do you not notice first I

2749
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,080
do it's a PC don't they have to like

2750
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:46,760
unplug a bunch of shit and you know pull

2751
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,080
it out of there and I mean you're

2752
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,880
hauling this giant PC with you I mean

2753
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,760
doesn't that look at a little bit

2754
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:54,760
suspicious I mean when somebody going

2755
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:57,480
through the car going hey why is that

2756
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:59,720

2757
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:01,680
seems a little suspicious to me game

2758
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:02,960
grew in our chat room with the

2759
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,080

director of product development talking

2776
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,240
about basically what you should and you

2777
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:50,000
shouldn't do when you pitch your indie

2778
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,920
game he said quote I'm sick of sitting

2779
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:56,240
through crap development pitches hmm

2780
02:14:56,240 --> 02:15:00,200
dark soccer let's play a game word let's

2781
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:01,920
see if you can guess what would be some

2782
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,760
of the do's and some of the don'ts if

2783
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:06,280
you're gonna pitch your indie game what

2784
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:07,640
are some of the do's and some of the

2785
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:11,160
don'ts what would be your guess Loki if

2786
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:12,320
you haven't spoiled this for yourself

2787
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:15,000
already you can play too well no cheating

2788
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,240
what to do when you're pitching it and

2789
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:18,920
what not to do yeah what would you do to

2790
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:20,480
pitch it and what what's what makes a

2791
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:21,600
good pitch and what doesn't make a good

2792
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,960
pitch well with a good pitch you want to

2793
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:25,400
definitely have some presentation

2794
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:28,360
materials like concept art something

2795
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:30,560
that's gonna be solid you want to have

2796
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,880
something well written out spelled

2797
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:37,080
correctly ding ding ding we have have

2798
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,640
assets this these include a one-page

2799
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:41,640
overview screenshots or video all on a

2800
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:43,240
USB stick for the publisher to keep

2801
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:45,840
don't waste time or money on swag good

2802
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:50,560
yeah I mean it's nice to have something

2803
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:52,160
kind of neat to throw in it but no one's

2804
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:54,040
gonna invest any money if they don't

2805
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:57,320
have at least an appetizer instead of

2806
02:15:57,320 --> 02:15:58,680
the meat and potatoes you know they need

2807
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:02,000
to see what the vision is need to have a

2808
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,880
projection need to see you know have a

2809
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:06,680
financial comparison to see if there's

2810
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:08,840
other games of a similar genre what

2811
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:10,520
they're making money with and how this

2812
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,040
is going to compare to them you know

2813
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:14,920
financial presentation what not to do is

2814
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:16,280
just say oh I've got an idea for a game

2815
02:16:16,280 --> 02:16:20,600
we give me money not to harass them with

2816
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:23,480
phone calls you send the first email you

2817
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:25,520
send them the test product you send a

2818
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:29,040
follow-up you wait for a response you

2819
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:30,360
know those aren't neither one that's not

2820
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:32,200
really on the list per se but I still

2821
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,640
think that's good advice I don't think

2822
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:36,600
that's necessarily wrong similar answers

2823
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:38,480
are there Loki did you cheat I didn't

2824
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:40,640
cheat all right what would you guess a

2825
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:47,000
pitch features tits and ass I you know

2826
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,040
what I will give that credit because on

2827
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:52,960
the do not list is be boring so certainly

2828
02:16:52,960 --> 02:16:55,720
that is the opposite of boring be boring

2829
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:59,600
is on the do not list I don't think that

2830
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:02,520
they want it try to stay away from like

2831
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,360
graphs and charts maybe I'll make more

2832
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:08,240
just quick summaries of like here's

2833
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,800
here's my story here's you know the

2834
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:12,960
concept that type of thing again the

2835
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:15,440
opposite is true so D need that on the

2836
02:17:15,440 --> 02:17:17,360
do list keep your visuals simple and

2837
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:21,040
bold basically so yeah so any house on

2838
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:24,280
the do list know what your game is be

2839
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:26,920
able to pitch it in 30 seconds yeah keep

2840
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:28,720
your visuals simple and bold you don't

2841
02:17:28,720 --> 02:17:30,480
have to you want it you want to show off

2842
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:33,080
gameplay not graphics exactly you want

2843
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:37,440
to be succinct research focus don't ask

2844
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:42,280
them what a Vita is really if you're

2845
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:44,040
gonna pitch to Sony don't ask them what

2846
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:46,520
a Vita is really really I have something

2847
02:17:46,520 --> 02:17:51,240
for your Vita system I have a vital game

2848
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:53,320
for the Vita well actually there's

2849
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:54,680
something else that occurred to me and I

2850
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:56,920
didn't look look at your screen that's

2851
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:59,240
haven't seen anything sure you want to

2852
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:01,160
make sure that the person making the

2853
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,280
pitch knows how to speak in front of

2854
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,600
people and then enunciate mm-hmm and has

2855
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:10,400
presence practice your pitch and choose

2856
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:13,560
the right person yeah or both there for

2857
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:15,440
real huh practice your pitch and choose

2858
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:17,360
the right person for the pitch someone

2859
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:19,000
who can talk about the game to a room of

2860
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,640
suits with ease exactly and who the

2861
02:18:21,640 --> 02:18:23,120
average person does not know corporate

2862
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:25,360
speak sorry let's see also on the list

2863
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:28,240
here be able to adapt because some games

2864
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:30,760
often don't end up what their pitch

2865
02:18:30,760 --> 02:18:34,040
manage your expectations Sony isn't

2866
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:35,680
gonna back a game unless it benefits them

2867
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:37,720
as well as you so be prepared to

2868
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:40,080
negotiate that IP I think that's a very

2869
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:42,760
realistic answer there let's see I think

2870
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:43,880
we hit on some of these other sell

2871
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:45,840
yourself as a company and as individuals

2872
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,280
I think that's very interesting because

2873
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,400
they say that you have to be able to

2874
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:52,280
work with the people not just the idea

2875
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:55,480
very interesting they say media molecule

2876
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,480
was a great example of this Sony wanted

2877
02:18:57,480 --> 02:18:59,360
to work with the people they followed

2878
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:00,800
through media molecule probably brought

2879
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,360
us one of the greatest Sony games ever

2880
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:06,320
period little big planet show passion if

2881
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:11,400
you don't care why will they hi I'm Ben

2882
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,880
Stein and here's my game all right

2883
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:15,240
lastly on the do not list then we'll

2884
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:18,320
move on don't be boring don't bitch and

2885
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,120
whine about other developers or

2886
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:22,200
publishers I think that's great advice

2887
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:23,920
don't burn your bridges and they just

2888
02:19:23,920 --> 02:19:27,040
say it's a small industry very true

2889
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,320
don't spend the entire time on your

2890
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:31,000
pitch because you want room for Q&A

2891
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:37,760
don't bullshit I you know there's

2892
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,680
already a million bullshit terms that

2893
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:41,200
though the people have used to fool the

2894
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,200
public like remember blast processing

2895
02:19:44,200 --> 02:19:46,440
yeah that's true yeah you know what all

2896
02:19:46,440 --> 02:19:48,600
that was that was the only thing the

2897
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,040
Genesis did better than the Super

2898
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:54,760
Nintendo just saying you know or like

2899
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,440
look at these graphics blah blah blah no

2900
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:59,440
substance you know that's bullshitting

2901
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:00,520
right there you just show them pretty

2902
02:20:00,520 --> 02:20:04,160
like what was heavenly sword Jane enemy

2903
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,720
crabs know it also has blast processing

2904
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:14,720

of your life to drink so that if you

don't believe that I was ever it'll be

2966
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:09,760
like Loki saw drugs or violence saw off

02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:53,240
okay hey all our people this is honey

2981
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:54,720
but I knew honey badger was gonna email

2982
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,080
cuz honey badger told me an email aka

2983
02:23:57,080 --> 02:24:00,080
blade 3 aka Sam call me whatever either

2984
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:01,640
way I just wanted to tell a little story

2985
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:05,000
about a funny experience with EA EA has

2986
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,120
been distinguished as being the world's

2987
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:09,280
shittiest company about two copies of

2988
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:11,680
the same game via origin basically a

2989
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:13,240
friend and I were looking for a way to

2990
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:15,520
play mercenaries two together because it

2991
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:18,520
was a cheap sale for it so I bought it

2992
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,280
with my origin account for me and then

2993
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:23,800
for him but wait origin does not have

2994
02:24:23,800 --> 02:24:25,600
the feature to let you gift a copy of a

2995
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:27,520
game so I told my friend I would log in

2996
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:29,540
as him and buy it for him and I did my

2997
02:24:29,540 --> 02:24:31,580
next move was contact EA to refund one

2998
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:33,360
of the games and after all I never

2999
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:35,540
access the download a game in any way

3000
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:37,960
and so why would there be a problem

3001
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:40,080
there so I pulled up EA live chat the

3002
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:43,360
rep I spoke to knew about one sentence

3003
02:24:43,360 --> 02:24:45,880
of English so that was great I told the

3004
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:47,920
rep I want an American customer support

3005
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:49,200
number and he gave it to me of course I

3006
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:50,480
had to wait till business hours to call

3007
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:52,920
which I did and I told the American rep

3008
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:54,600
about my problem and he gladly refunded

3009
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:56,720
me no harm no foul we then had a

3010
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,400
conversation in which he told me origin

3011
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:00,400
and the entire EA digital game system is

3012
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:03,120
a travesty and is complete garbage I

3013
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,880
thought that says a lot when your own

3014
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:07,360
employees tell customers that they agree

3015
02:25:07,360 --> 02:25:09,400
that their system is shit so that's all

3016
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:12,480
I just thought I so that's all just

3017
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:13,960
thought it was funny keep up the good

3018
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:17,080
work Sam there's really truly only one

3019
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:25,400
thing I can say about all of that what

3020
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:26,880
I'm gonna say there's hostile employees

3021
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:29,320
at every workplace so that's true this

3022
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:31,800
company sucks I ain't working here

3023
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:35,120
they're always the best because they'll

3024
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:36,280
give you the most stuff because they

3025
02:25:36,280 --> 02:25:39,280
hate their job okay PS upon trying to

3026
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:42,080
play to place Mercs 2 online we found

3027
02:25:42,080 --> 02:25:43,960
out EA no longer ran servers for the

3028
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:46,840
game and did not release a dedicated

3029
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:49,680
server for people to play overland PSS

3030
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:52,240
what's even better is that the copy of

3031
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:54,040
Mercs 2 I was refunded for still works

3032
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:57,360
and I got my money revenge woo a winner

3033
02:25:57,360 --> 02:26:00,960
is you way to work this system okay

3034
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:03,480
it's because you got the employee who

3035
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:06,320
who checked out years ago this comes

3036
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:11,040
from Sam another Sam hi Sam dark soccer

3037
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,480
never ceases to bring up important

3038
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:13,760
points why thank you because I know I'm

3039
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,400
awesome dark soccer has me wondering if

3040
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:18,120
the next PlayStation and Xbox will have

3041
02:26:18,120 --> 02:26:19,640
the same controllers as the current

3042
02:26:19,640 --> 02:26:22,080
systems or will they be redesigned what

3043
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,840
do you all think I'll be redesigned

3044
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,440
there there's always a some type of

3045
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:28,560
redesign but think about this remember I

3046
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:30,080
don't I mean I don't know the marine

3047
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:31,840
controls is exactly what I was gonna say

3048
02:26:31,840 --> 02:26:32,840
I don't know how long Sam's been

3049
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:34,560
following video game news but remember

3050
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,280
when the PlayStation 3 was first revealed

3051
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:37,960
they had that boomerang controller and

3052
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:39,440
everything what's this uncomfortable

3053
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,440
looking shit literally the internet all

3054
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:45,000
in unison went lol what and so they went

3055
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,840
back to a controller that kind of looked

3056
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:49,000
like the DualShock 2 except they looked

3057
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,920
exactly like the DualShock 2 but it had

3058
02:26:50,920 --> 02:26:54,200
six axis remember was the big six axis

3059
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:56,120
because we can't put DualShock in it

3060
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:57,720
anymore because the lawsuit although

3061
02:26:57,720 --> 02:26:59,200
that finally worked itself out and they

3062
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,760
put it back in there but you don't need

3063
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:04,600
rumble rumble was so last-gen and I need

3064
02:27:04,600 --> 02:27:07,880
rumble anybody rumble was so last-gen

3065
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:10,800
Ridge Racers gonna use six axis so

3066
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:12,760
here's the deal which is pile of crap

3067
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:15,840
PlayStation 4 probably not gonna buck

3068
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,200
the trend too much I mean I would think

3069
02:27:18,200 --> 02:27:20,200
maybe one thing they're gonna try to do

3070
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:22,440
I don't I don't know why I'm just

3071
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:24,320
putting my little light little tinfoil

3072
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:25,880
hat I think it'll kind of look like a

3073
02:27:25,880 --> 02:27:27,240
ps3 controller but they're gonna try to

3074
02:27:27,240 --> 02:27:29,320
push that rear touch thing on those

3075
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:30,600
controllers it's gonna be a little

3076
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:32,800
ridiculous but that's just what I think

3077
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,120
I can see that but I think the basic

3078
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:36,760
design isn't gonna change Xbox will

3079
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:38,680
change somewhat I think even the

3080
02:27:38,680 --> 02:27:40,400
controller the controller design changed

3081
02:27:40,400 --> 02:27:43,480
within that first as deep remember the

3082
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:46,040
remember the first Xbox was gigantic

3083
02:27:46,040 --> 02:27:47,960
those gigantic Xbox controls and they

3084
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:50,320
scaled them down and then the Xbox 360

3085
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:52,440
controller was relatively similar enough

3086
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:55,440
you know well and if now looking at

3087
02:27:55,440 --> 02:27:56,840
other systems I think Nintendo is gonna

3088
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:57,800
have a different controller every

3089
02:27:57,800 --> 02:27:59,760
second time yeah I mean that that's the

3090
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:01,520
one that is radically different every

3091
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,400
time that never looked really much

3092
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:06,560
difference was the well even when they

3093
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:07,800
brought out the top loading nest they

3094
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:10,360
had this nest style controller kind of

3095
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:12,520
but there was still a basic paddle and

3096
02:28:12,520 --> 02:28:15,720
button layout you know now the ones that

3097
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:18,880
I as far as logical redesigns have gone

3098
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:22,800
as if you take the Sega systems gone for

3099
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:24,200
the master system gone to the Genesis

3100
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:25,360
gone to the six button Genesis

3101
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:27,120
controller to the Saturn that had a

3102
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:30,080
similar controller to the Genesis to the

3103
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:32,080
dual analog controller which I was I

3104
02:28:32,080 --> 02:28:34,000
will stand on this to this day best

3105
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,640
controller ever then the Dreamcast

3106
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:41,320
carry the similar style to the the I

3107
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:43,280
just said it the dual analog controller

3108
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:46,040
because it made sense it was comfortable

3109
02:28:46,040 --> 02:28:48,040
it looks hard but it's super comfortable

3110
02:28:48,040 --> 02:28:50,320
10 to 64 what the fuck was Nintendo

3111
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:54,520
thinking but I mean I think that using

3112
02:28:54,520 --> 02:28:58,040
the those examples I think that the

3113
02:28:58,040 --> 02:29:01,200
company's the the powers that be except

3114
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:03,320
for Nintendo have learned their lesson

3115
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:06,360
for making too many variables in you

3116
02:29:06,360 --> 02:29:08,640
know when it comes to controller

3117
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:10,720
progression and are sticking with the

3118
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:14,440
tried-and-true shape this I mean I may

3119
02:29:14,440 --> 02:29:16,760
not be the biggest Sony fan but I have

3120
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:18,840
to say that the controller has always

3121
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:21,120
had an ergonomically comfortable shape

3122
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:24,520
I do find it easier to hold it than I do

3123
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:27,360
an Xbox controller even though I tend to

3124
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:30,400
like games better on Xbox the PlayStation

3125
02:29:30,400 --> 02:29:31,600
controller is easier to hold I think

3126
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:33,560
they'll stick with it one thing to keep

3127
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:34,920
in mind to free move on to the next

3128
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:38,240
email is that keep in mind the next Xbox

3129
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:40,560
is going to be very heavy on this whole

3130
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,600
whatever the new Kinect is whatever this

3131
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:45,040
advanced Kinect is Microsoft wants

3132
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:46,920
Kinect to happen I mean I guess Kinect

3133
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:48,280
already has happened but they want it to

3134
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:50,120
be more than a fad they're gonna shove

3135
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,920
this thing down your throat in the next

3136
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:55,120
Xbox so even though yes there will be a

3137
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,800
tangible controller there has to be for

3138
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:59,080
the halo games expect that Microsoft

3139
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:00,560
will make a big deal out of the whole

3140
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:03,320
hands free now you can control it with

3141
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,440
your fingers because it's so precise you

3142
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:07,080
can just use your little finger better

3143
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:09,080
be things you're gonna use little fingers

3144
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,320
to point at things that's awesome expect

3145
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:13,160
that play the controller as much as I

3146
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:17,440
want to like that concept I think that

3147
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:20,880
you're dealing with to the the bulk of

3148
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:24,640
gamers at least that have the money to

3149
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,600
afford any of this are going to be in our

3150
02:30:26,600 --> 02:30:28,640
age group people who have grown up with

3151
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:30,240
a controller in their hand and they've

3152
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:31,920
tried this before with like remember the

3153
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:35,320
u-force oh that was crap or the

3154
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:37,760
activator they've tried hands-free

3155
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,880
controllers before and true the

3156
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:41,520
technology wasn't what it is today I

3157
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:43,840
mean definitely Kinect is I'd have to

3158
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:45,840
say up at the best of it but the very

3159
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,680
least with Nintendo and with the move

3160
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,840
you've still got something tangible that

3161
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,520
you can hold people like that tactile

3162
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:54,880
experience and you remember that thing

3163
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:57,120
that they were making for so you could

3164
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:58,680
feel the textures of things and games

3165
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:00,880
yeah how it was that thing was kind of

3166
02:31:00,880 --> 02:31:02,760
cool the haptic stuff yeah that was

3167
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:04,840
pretty cool but I mean everybody said

3168
02:31:04,840 --> 02:31:08,320
it was going to be in the next iPad so

3169
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:11,640
good okay now your iPad will touch you

3170
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:16,320
oh baby no but the whole point like I

3171
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:19,360
said oh you put your dick on it people

3172
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:22,040
like a tactile experience I bet they do

3173
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:25,720
that's what I'm talking about you guys

3174
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:30,760
are children seriously but logically

3175
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:33,400
take away the five-year-old laughing at

3176
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:35,840
everything am I right would do you

3177
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:37,400
prefer to have something in your hand

3178
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:40,080
while you play or do you like waving

3179
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,160
your hands in the air unless you're

3180
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:42,880
playing para para the yeah it's

3181
02:31:42,880 --> 02:31:44,840
acceptable if I'm playing dance central

3182
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:46,800
that's really the only game and and it's

3183
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,800
clones those those dancing games are

3184
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:50,000
really the only ones that have really

3185
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,720
been a great experience dancing even the

3186
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:53,840
fitness stuff if that actually works you

3187
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:55,560
know mm-hmm yeah when the fitness games

3188
02:31:55,560 --> 02:31:57,600
work yeah yeah I'll agree with that same

3189
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,080
thing same thing with the we you know

3190
02:31:59,080 --> 02:32:01,120
and all that but um like for I just

3191
02:32:01,120 --> 02:32:02,360
bitched about this last week of the week

3192
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:04,640
before that Disneyland Connect I want to

3193
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:06,400
pick up a controller and play it yeah

3194
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:09,520
oh and especially when you're dealing

3195
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:12,160
it's like they're trying to retrain an

3196
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:14,640
entire generation of gamers they want

3197
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:17,880
all the newer ones coming in to have a

3198
02:32:17,880 --> 02:32:20,080
different experience and we did where

3199
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:22,120
I'm sorry we're the ones with the money

3200
02:32:22,120 --> 02:32:24,320
and there's nothing wrong with having a

3201
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:27,360
controller you know now the only

3202
02:32:27,360 --> 02:32:29,200
advantage like I said I can see for

3203
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:30,680
having some of this is like if someone's

3204
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:33,080
got my you know horrific hand problems

3205
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:34,880
but what did I do I stopped playing on

3206
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:36,120
the consoles and started playing on my

3207
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:38,680
PC well I think also that they want to

3208
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:39,800
get rid of the controller because a lot

3209
02:32:39,800 --> 02:32:42,720
of elderly and older people think that

3210
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:44,640
controllers are too confusing and so

3211
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:45,920
it's like all you have to do is wave

3212
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:48,200
your hands oh I can do that I wave my

3213
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:50,160
hands at old random strangers all the

3214
02:32:50,160 --> 02:32:53,480
time so I'm totally used to this my hand

3215
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:55,680
to get kids off my lawn I can use I can

3216
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:58,720
use this as another kind of analogy here

3217
02:32:58,720 --> 02:33:02,080
I would I was in band and Rob you know

3218
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:03,680
this you were in band what you play

3219
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,440
clarinet yes okay well I put clarinet

3220
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:10,880
too so hush but anyone who's a musician

3221
02:33:10,880 --> 02:33:12,000
also knows that when you play an

3222
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,200
instrument it's not necessarily that

3223
02:33:14,200 --> 02:33:15,720
your brain learns it is that your

3224
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:19,520
fingers learn what to do you know you

3225
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:21,720
can I bet you anything that if I picked

3226
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:23,040
up my saxophone I could still play

3227
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,760
through any number of scales and not

3228
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,720
think about it because my fingers have

3229
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:29,320
been trained to do this my reflex is

3230
02:33:29,320 --> 02:33:30,960
trained the same goes with playing a

3231
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:33,600
game after a while it's that your

3232
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:36,360
fingers your thumbs become accustomed to

3233
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:38,160
doing certain things you're not actively

3234
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,160
thinking that you're doing it you just

3235
02:33:40,160 --> 02:33:42,240
make a decision and you do it you know

3236
02:33:42,240 --> 02:33:46,000
it's instinct it becomes was it motor

3237
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,640
response isn't that what it's called

3238
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:50,840
motor memory or something yeah and so I

3239
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:52,640
think that's the other thing too is that

3240
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:56,520
if you look at the people who are worse

3241
02:33:56,520 --> 02:34:00,320
with with being coordinated like actual

3242
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:02,520
dancing and everything I can't dance for

3243
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:05,600
crap but I can you know I can play a

3244
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:07,720
game I can you are like a son of a bitch

3245
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:10,440
exactly well exactly because that has to

3246
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:12,480
do more with the same thing that's you

3247
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:15,400
know it's a different type of your it's

3248
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:17,400
and you have your hand eye coordination

3249
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:19,000
going but you don't have something

3250
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:20,880
that's going to be an abstract movement

3251
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:22,720
as something that has attacked our

3252
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:24,680
response so anyway

3253
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:28,120
fair enough next email I forgot what I

3254
02:34:28,120 --> 02:34:31,280
was saying oh yeah hi olr just wanted to

02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,040

I did say it on my facebook and got into

3297
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:28,640

3298
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:29,760

02:36:36,680 --> 02:36:38,640
the Republican Party and their choice of

3302
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:41,720
who's running and his running mate I

3303
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:44,640
don't think that I and I really am trying

3304
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:47,080
not to be judgmental I mean okay I'm a

3305
02:36:47,080 --> 02:36:48,200
judgmental bitch anyway but it doesn't

3306
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:52,600
matter but anyone who supports that

3307
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:56,720
level of evil I don't know that I would

3308
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:58,360
be able to look them in the eye so fuck

3309
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:02,720
that level of evil and then

3310
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:08,520
see I guess if you to

3311
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:13,160
I don't know be burnt out at work

3312
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:17,520
I hear ya I would say it's kind of a

3313
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:19,400
similar f you not that I like nothing

3314
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:20,840
like I'm burned out on work as I really

3315
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:22,360
do like my job but just f you to the

3316
02:37:22,360 --> 02:37:25,240
fact that I'm starting a class next week

3317
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:26,760
it's like oh god it's at my first class

3318
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:29,280
like nine months and it's gonna be the

3319
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,400
long hours again and prepare to get no

3320
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:33,200
sleep and all that stuff I'm just like f

3321
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:34,800
you do the toll it's about to take on my

3322
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:37,580
body and more importantly and f you to a

3323
02:37:37,580 --> 02:37:40,280
real toll on my body f you to myself for

3324
02:37:40,280 --> 02:37:42,120
overdoing it at the gym Monday because

3325
02:37:42,120 --> 02:37:44,300
like I really hurt my leg by I guess I

3326
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:45,760
didn't stretch good enough beforehand

3327
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:48,640
or I did too much resistance and on the

3328
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:50,440
bike because I do a lot of cardio and

3329
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:52,200
yeah I was paying for it for like five

3330
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:53,640
days I couldn't go back to the gym I

3331
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:55,760
really wanted to go if I may hmm and

3332
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,680
this is what has been drilled into my

3333
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:00,480
head by all of I used to be really good

3334
02:38:00,480 --> 02:38:03,680
friends with one of my gym the ladies

3335
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:05,840
that talk classes at my gym and you're

3336
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,560
supposed to do a five-minute light warm

3337
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:10,560
up then stretch then do your stuff oh I

3338
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:12,840
didn't do that I mean I do I do the

3339
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:14,600
light never stretch your muscles hold

3340
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:16,840
just go right in there high resistance

3341
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:18,840
obviously I tried to do the up down like

3342
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:20,360
the little you know up and down like

3343
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:24,080
type of thing but circuit style I guess

3344
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,000
but I don't like circuit implies to me

3345
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,840
you do five minutes on every machine I'm

3346
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:29,680
not at that level yet you know I just I

3347
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:32,360
it's if I can get my fat ass on a bike

3348
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,520
and roll around on it for an hour that

3349
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:37,160
is an accomplishment for me so but um

3350
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:40,460
it's you never want to work out with

3351
02:38:40,460 --> 02:38:43,480
muscles that are cold you always want

3352
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:44,880
like Dan you should just go sit in a

3353
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:46,480
sauna before he did anything anything

3354
02:38:46,480 --> 02:38:48,120
but honestly you actually want to work

3355
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:50,080
and then stretch and then work hmm

3356
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:52,440
interesting yeah just learning something

3357
02:38:52,440 --> 02:38:55,200
we fit didn't tell me that or maybe it

3358
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:57,840
didn't I wasn't like I said you know all

3359
02:38:57,840 --> 02:38:59,640
the time I used to spend working out so

3360
02:38:59,640 --> 02:39:01,080
all right just a couple more news

3361
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:02,120
stories for you guys and then the

3362
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:05,360
skype line at 1 8 7 7 game olr as well

3363
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:06,840
as the Twitter topics have to get out my

3364
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:09,080
iPad and see if there are any and any

3365
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:11,520
last-minute stories Loki might have but

3366
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:13,480
first two final stories for you guys

3367
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:16,240
Loki all right so one of the games I

3368
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:17,400
mentioned that played this week was

3369
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:22,000
castle miner Z which is sold 900,000

3370
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:23,680
copies and apparently is one of the

3371
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:25,520
fastest-selling Xbox live indie games

3372
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:28,000
not sure if it's the fastest selling one

3373
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,920
but I know because I know I made a

3374
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:33,440
zombie games in it all right look sorry

3375
02:39:33,440 --> 02:39:35,720
about that game with zombies in it sold

3376
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:38,280
quite a bit and then I'm sure there's

3377
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:40,480
been some other ones that have done

3378
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:42,920
well as a part of the indie games

3379
02:39:42,920 --> 02:39:44,960
program but it's definitely one of the

3380
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:48,000
most recent ones according to the

3381
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,920
developer and then also I guess it is at

3382
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:55,080
the top of the daily best-selling area

3383
02:39:55,080 --> 02:39:57,840
of xbox.com right now and it's only 80

3384
02:39:57,840 --> 02:39:59,240
microsoft points so if you want to check

3385
02:39:59,240 --> 02:40:01,120
it out I'm sure there's also a lot of

3386
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:03,120
other good games for 80 microsoft points

3387
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:05,840
on the indie games as well and another

3388
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:09,760
unrelated news minecraft 7 million

3389
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,240
copies sold on PC so that's pretty cool

3390
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:14,880
so that genre of game seems to be doing

3391
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:18,320
pretty well it just won't die the

3392
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:21,720
phenomenon will not stop well something

3393
02:40:21,720 --> 02:40:24,160
that has stopped a guitar hero or at

3394
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,800
least it's on ice for a little while and

3395
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:29,200
now the lawsuits can begin they of

3396
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:31,760
course started some time ago but uh you

3397
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:33,320
know we talked about no doubts lawsuit

3398
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:34,440
well they're not the only ones that are

3399
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:36,120
suing Activision over the whole guitar

3400
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:38,960
hero and band hero stuff axle rose

3401
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:45,240
remember Guns N' Roses well axle rose had

3402
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:46,960
a preliminary hearing about the guitar

3403
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:49,320
hero 3 lawsuit apparently there is a

3404
02:40:49,320 --> 02:40:52,400
tentative court date in February 2013

3405
02:40:52,400 --> 02:40:55,200
axle rose is pissed about the game which

3406
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,640
came out in late 2007 as a reminder and

3407
02:40:58,640 --> 02:41:02,000
it will finally go to court in 2013

3408
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:05,320
apparently it unlawfully associated Guns

3409
02:41:05,320 --> 02:41:09,200
N' Roses music with slash who as you

3410
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,680
know was formerly with good Guns N'

3411
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:14,440
Roses and him and axle rose they don't

3412
02:41:14,440 --> 02:41:17,000
get along so axle rose was pissed about

3413
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:18,360
that basically saying slash was

3414
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:20,000
associated with these songs but they're

3415
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,040
not his song so fuck all y'all right well

3416
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:26,240
the judge during the preliminary hearing

3417
02:41:26,240 --> 02:41:28,920
wanted to toss out the claim of fraud

3418
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:31,280
because the statute of limitations has

3419
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:36,000
expired however let's see it came up

3420
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,320
here quote the reason I did not file a

3421
02:41:38,320 --> 02:41:40,320
lawsuit because Activision through my

3422
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:42,120
managers and representatives offered me

3423
02:41:42,120 --> 02:41:44,920
a separate video game and other business

3424
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:47,160
proposals worth millions of dollars to

3425
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:49,400
resolve and settle my claims relating to

3426
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:52,680
guitar hero 3 from December 2007 through

3427
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:55,280
November 2010 Activision was offering me

3428
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:57,680
a Guns N' Roses dedicated video game a

3429
02:41:57,680 --> 02:42:00,080
game dedicated to music from the Chinese

3430
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:03,160
democracy album and other proposals

3431
02:42:03,160 --> 02:42:06,280
interesting so the judge did dismiss the

3432
02:42:06,280 --> 02:42:07,680
claim of fraud but the breach of

3433
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:09,560
contract it is moving forward for

3434
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:13,240
February 1st 2013 so that's why it took

3435
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:14,960
axle rose three years to file a lawsuit

3436
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:17,240
because they were basically cock teasing

3437
02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:18,960
him about his own game or so he claims

3438
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:22,080
allegedly all that good stuff but it

3439
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:23,960
makes sense why they decided not to do

3440
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:26,320
it because when guitar hero Van Halen

3441
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:28,000
and band hero and all that kind of

3442
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,520
oversaturated the market you know I

3443
02:42:30,520 --> 02:42:32,760
don't those artists centric video games

3444
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:34,640
none of them really did very well the

3445
02:42:34,640 --> 02:42:36,920
only one that did marginally good was

3446
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:38,800
the Beatles and when the Beatles can

3447
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:41,360
only do marginally successful it's not

3448
02:42:41,360 --> 02:42:43,560
good enough you know the Green Day one

3449
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:45,960
didn't do so hot Van Halen not so great

3450
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:47,360
what was the other one there was one

3451
02:42:47,360 --> 02:42:51,120
more guitar hero italica allah oh god

3452
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:54,960
that was not just not a good game so

3453
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:57,680
raman our chat room says a dedicated

3454
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:59,840
actual rose game and Aerosmith does it

3455
02:42:59,840 --> 02:43:01,880
come complete with heroin does it come

3456
02:43:01,880 --> 02:43:03,840
with shame and a bottle of vodka oh I

3457
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:09,480
like his better welcome to unemployment

3458
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:13,880

we do have a couple of them SSJ 100 Matt

3473
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,320
sent us a tweet and I think I already

3474
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:41,800
know what this is without going to it

3475
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:43,680
but he says it's a tweet that says this

3476
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:46,480
is how China gets rid of outlawed arcade

3477
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:48,960
machines or what they call gambling

3478
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:50,600
machines and he sends us a link to a

3479
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:53,320
story from arcade heroes calm yep I had

3480
02:43:53,320 --> 02:43:55,520
a feeling look at all these arcade

3481
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:57,960
machines on fire they just set them on

3482
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:00,920
fire burn it with fire burn it with fire

3483
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:04,640
and there they go Loki do you have any

3484
02:44:04,640 --> 02:44:07,360
last-minute stories for us no I forgot

3485
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:09,220
to mention it as part of my gaming week

3486
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:12,400
I actually played mega zooks that's

3487
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:16,640
right the old ZZT type game actually

3488
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:18,640
booted that up I was like oh hey I'll

3489
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,040
make something in this and then I

3490
02:44:20,040 --> 02:44:23,160
realized how out of practice and making

3491
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:26,000
stuff with mega zooks I was so I said

3492
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,120
that fuck it don't care anymore I

3493
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:29,920
remember mega zooks that's awesome it

3494
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:32,560
was awesome good times all right let's

3495
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:35,600
go to some tweets from Tiger claw heavy

3496
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:37,600
rain director tells game industry it's

3497
02:44:37,600 --> 02:44:40,440
time to grow up before I even get into

3498
02:44:40,440 --> 02:44:41,720
the article what do you guys think is it

3499
02:44:41,720 --> 02:44:44,160
time for the games industry to grow up

3500
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:47,280
here's we mean by grow up here's here's

3501
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,000
the one goes to one corner the other

3502
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,600
goes to another corner here's the pole

3503
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:52,920
here's the pole quote from gamasutra

3504
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:55,040
which Tiger claw linked us to on Twitter

3505
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:57,680
at twitter.com slash olr I mean how many

3506
02:44:57,680 --> 02:44:59,440
first-person shooters can you make

3507
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:01,480
there's a moment where we need to grow

3508
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:04,360
up and that's David cage who is the

3509
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:06,320
director of beyond two souls you know

3510
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:09,680
I'm sorry it sounds like he needs a grow

3511
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:11,120
up because he's just it sounds like he's

3512
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:12,800
whining that heavy rain didn't sell as

3513
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:14,440
well you know what they're making games

3514
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:16,480
that sell well hold on though because I

3515
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:18,680
do agree with this you know that pole

3516
02:45:18,680 --> 02:45:20,440
quote is a little sensational but let's

3517
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:21,800
get into the full quote here now I'm in

3518
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:24,120
the article quote I think we should have

3519
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:26,000
more courage in our industry and take

3520
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,360
more risks because I think this is what

3521
02:45:28,360 --> 02:45:29,880
the industry needs now I mean how many

3522
02:45:29,880 --> 02:45:31,600
first-person shooters can you make how

3523
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:33,440
many monsters alien zombies can you

3524
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:35,300
killing games there's a moment where we

3525
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:37,080
need to grow up we need to grow up I

3526
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:39,440
think I often think the industry suffers

3527
02:45:39,440 --> 02:45:41,200
at the Peter Pan syndrome it's the fact

3528
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:42,700
that we don't want to grow up so we stay

3529
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:44,600
kids but there is a moment where you

3530
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:45,960
need to grow up as an industry and you

3531
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:47,320
cannot keep up with the Peter Pan

3532
02:45:47,320 --> 02:45:49,060
syndrome you need to grow and I think

3533
02:45:49,060 --> 02:45:50,840
this is the right time maybe I don't

3534
02:45:50,840 --> 02:45:52,120
agree so much with the second part of

3535
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:53,640
that but the first part about they need

3536
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,640
some different shit I kind of agree with

3537
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:59,120
it like you know who isn't sick of sequel

3538
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:01,920
sequel sequel sequel I mean granted I

3539
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,880
guess in some ways we support it but I

3540
02:46:03,880 --> 02:46:07,320
do like a lot of the new ideas you know

3541
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:09,480
if we did never experimented with new

3542
02:46:09,480 --> 02:46:11,560
ideas we wouldn't have recent hits like

3543
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:14,120
Mass Effect or Little Big Planet or

3544
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:15,520
which granted all spawn their own

3545
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:18,720
sequels but you know good games even on

3546
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:21,080
the indie side braid limbo Mass Effect

3547
02:46:21,080 --> 02:46:22,920
kind of turned into just a shooter with

3548
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:27,860
this story but I'm just I think that the

3549
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:29,320
reason why they're not taking risks

3550
02:46:29,320 --> 02:46:30,560
right now because whenever they seem to

3551
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:33,320
try to take risks they end up not selling

3552
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,760
well those games and you know some of

3553
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:37,760
these companies are in trouble like THQ

3554
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:39,900
for example they took a risk with you

3555
02:46:39,900 --> 02:46:43,560
know making that whole you know tablet

3556
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:45,400
drawing pad thing because everyone's

3557
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:47,880
like oh hey cool it's like you know like

3558
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:50,240
Mario Paint and then no one bought it

3559
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:53,000
and then you know they're they're out a

3560
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:54,760
lot of money because that franchise

3561
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:57,480
never took off or you know Tony Hawk

3562
02:46:57,480 --> 02:46:59,360
they made you know the stupid game with

3563
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:01,520
the skateboard and that was taking risks

3564
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:03,260
and no one bought it and then they did

3565
02:47:03,260 --> 02:47:05,480
you know DJ hero and that was kind of

3566
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:07,160
taking risks as well in the music genre

3567
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:08,240
and I thought it's a pretty cool game

3568
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:10,520
but not that many people bought it so

3569
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:13,080
this is what you get pretty ourselves

3570
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:15,280
mad mad world there's another example of

3571
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:17,040
a game that took risks on the Wii no one

3572
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:20,240
bought it um conduit pretty awesome

3573
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:21,960
first-person shooter game on the Wii no

3574
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:24,000
one bought it so that's where your risk

3575
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,920
come back left act Epton chat says I

3576
02:47:25,920 --> 02:47:28,400
bought Mario Paint well yeah you bought

3577
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:29,720
Mario Paint but you didn't buy the

3578
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:32,400

school games and so forth but am I

3603
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:24,960
hearing it right that now you have to

3604
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:26,520
say you you you turned your back on

3605
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:28,240
bimani today so you could get laid is

3606
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:30,920
that what I'm hearing that and what and

3607
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:33,640
and watching expendables too with her

3608
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:36,440
which she actually like enjoyed like

3609
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:38,080
even though she was kind of hesitant at

3610
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:40,520
first she actually enjoyed watching old

3611
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:43,760
man like shoot guns and kill people well

3612
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:46,960
she's a keeper I think that's amazing

3613
02:48:46,960 --> 02:48:50,280
that finally it's the Zaku is now

3614
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:52,520
officially over bimani everybody and

3615
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:54,880
not really girls are going for today

3616
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:57,960
only for that day I mean I might compete

3617
02:48:57,960 --> 02:49:00,480
next year if I'm more prepared but right

3618
02:49:00,480 --> 02:49:03,040
now it's like I didn't want to bother

3619
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:05,440
this year because I said we already like

3620
02:49:05,440 --> 02:49:07,400
been dating for for a little over six

3621
02:49:07,400 --> 02:49:10,280
months now so it's like it makes sense

3622
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:12,400
to just skip this this path and try the

3623
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:14,960
next one mm-hmm there will definitely be

3624
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:16,360
another Kings of the Coast next year

3625
02:49:16,360 --> 02:49:18,120
given the fact that it was like it was

3626
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:21,640
packed last it was packed yesterday and

3627
02:49:21,640 --> 02:49:23,120
a lot of people entered I think they're

3628
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:25,120
about they're almost wrapping up the

3629
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:27,000
doubles tournament right now as we speak

3630
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,640
what version of 2dx do they have out

3631
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:32,200
there in Jersey link oh wow they have

3632
02:49:32,200 --> 02:49:34,440
out not far from me and Queens nice

3633
02:49:34,440 --> 02:49:36,360
that's not you know what though it's not

3634
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:37,840
hard to pack eight on the break I seem

3635
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:39,520
to remember it was kind of a small place

3636
02:49:39,520 --> 02:49:40,880
is it well because the arcade machines

3637
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:42,360
took up a lot of room it would be hard

3638
02:49:42,360 --> 02:49:44,240
to pack that joint and I say the same

3639
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:46,880
thing about SVGL what is similar I mean

3640
02:49:46,880 --> 02:49:48,520
it's it's not hard to pack that place

3641
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:50,440
because there's not a lot of space

3642
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:54,120
anyways speaking or let's digress a

3643
02:49:54,120 --> 02:49:56,240
little bit sure I'm gonna like post up a

3644
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:57,600
link to an article that you probably

3645
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,360
like already discussed in uh probably

3646
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:02,800
earlier before I got on maybe about the

3647
02:50:02,800 --> 02:50:05,400
Assassin's Creed 3 director basically

3648
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:09,960
chiding Japanese games and playing the

3649
02:50:09,960 --> 02:50:11,320
race card because they're basically

3650
02:50:11,320 --> 02:50:14,040
getting a free pass actually we didn't

3651
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:16,080
bring this up earlier so I'm glad you

3652
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:17,560
are go ahead and tell us a little bit

3653
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:19,560
about this all right long story short

3654
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:21,920
the director of the creative director of

3655
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:24,240
Assassin's Creed 3 Alex Hutchinson he

3656
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:26,560
basically went on a rant earlier last

3657
02:50:26,560 --> 02:50:29,800
earlier last weekend and in deriding why

3658
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:32,320
like a certain like Japanese games are

3659
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:34,680
getting like free passes like something

3660
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:38,360
about me I saying stuff about like

3661
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:41,280
Japanese just how many Japanese games

3662
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:43,120
are released where the stories are

3663
02:50:43,120 --> 02:50:45,080
literally gibberish literally gibberish

3664
02:50:45,080 --> 02:50:47,160
there's no way you could write it with a

3665
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:49,200
straight face and you're gonna say oh

3666
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,520
really yeah let me let me let me read

3667
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:52,760
this quote here and this is what you're

3668
02:50:52,760 --> 02:50:54,080
going off of here and this is in an

3669
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:57,960
interview with CVG he said just think

3670
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:59,200
about how many Japanese games are

3671
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:00,300
released where their stories are

3672
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:02,240
literally literally gibberish literally

3673
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:03,640
gibberish there's no way you could write

3674
02:51:03,640 --> 02:51:05,000
it with a straight face and journalists

3675
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,680
say oh it's brilliant then Gears of War

3676
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:09,040
comes out and apparently it's the worst

3677
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:10,640
written narrative in a game ever I'll

3678
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:12,580
take Gears of War over Bayonetta every

3679
02:51:12,580 --> 02:51:15,240
any time it's patronizing to say oh

3680
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:17,040
those Japanese stories they don't really

3681
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,320
mean what they're doing I don't get why

3682
02:51:19,320 --> 02:51:21,920
critics didn't like Gears of War that's

3683
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:24,240
news to me and I don't like better game

3684
02:51:24,240 --> 02:51:25,960
when he talks about the whole deal but

3685
02:51:25,960 --> 02:51:28,880
the real kicker is like the his first

3686
02:51:28,880 --> 02:51:31,320
response you want my real answer I think

3687
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:33,760
there's a subtle racism in the business

3688
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:35,120
especially on the journalist side where

3689
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:37,120
Japanese developers are forgiven for

3690
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:38,520
doing what they do I think it's

3691
02:51:38,520 --> 02:51:41,200
condescending to do this so he really

3692
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:43,160
like goes off the bat he really like

3693
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:44,800
goes through the juggler on the first on

3694
02:51:44,800 --> 02:51:47,040
the first sentence I just I think he's I

3695
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:48,960
mean what about we just talked I'll tell

3696
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:50,160
you what we did talk about earlier in

3697
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:52,920
the show Final Fantasy you know the

3698
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:55,480
Final Fantasy 13 did get hazed for a lot

3699
02:51:55,480 --> 02:51:57,240
of that stuff and being too linear in a

3700
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:59,120
way and then of course 14 got right

3701
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:02,400
through the damn coals so well 14 was an

3702
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:04,240
abomination because it was poorly

3703
02:52:04,240 --> 02:52:06,840
executed and the fact that so many like

3704
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:09,320
gaps and in the beginning and then to

3705
02:52:09,320 --> 02:52:12,000
the point where they had actually you

3706
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,880
know the creative director and the

3707
02:52:13,880 --> 02:52:15,480
producers had to like hand in the

3708
02:52:15,480 --> 02:52:19,000
resignations it was just a cluster

3709
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,360
whereas if you I mean if you look at

3710
02:52:21,360 --> 02:52:23,520
other American RPGs like Skyrim which

3711
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:24,680
I'm actually going through right now

3712
02:52:24,680 --> 02:52:27,520
thank you steam sale of last month but

3713
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:30,240
you see how how how verse that game is

3714
02:52:30,240 --> 02:52:31,920
like it's getting to the point where

3715
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:34,640
I'm like putting at least two hours a

3716
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:37,040
night right now just on Skyrim alone

3717
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:38,840
because it's like so much so many things

3718
02:52:38,840 --> 02:52:41,280
to do you can level up your character if

3719
02:52:41,280 --> 02:52:43,160
you wanted to continue on the side on

3720
02:52:43,160 --> 02:52:45,480
the main quest do some side quests try

3721
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:47,920
your luck in killing Giants and so it's

3722
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:50,000
also but it's almost like a GTA but with

3723
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,000
actual like goals towards like beefing

3724
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:56,560
up your character stats and I think

3725
02:52:56,560 --> 02:52:59,360
what goes wrong with a with Japanese

3726
02:52:59,360 --> 02:53:02,040
games like Final Fantasy it only sticks

3727
02:53:02,040 --> 02:53:03,960
to I mean there is an open world there

3728
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:05,920
is a concept of an open world but

3729
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:08,000
everything is pretty much linear in the

3730
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,080
sense that you have to do x mission y

3731
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:13,040
mission side quests and obviously we did

3732
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:14,760
the occasional grinding there's no like

3733
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:16,840
there's no retribution where you could

3734
02:53:16,840 --> 02:53:18,840
attack freely any other type of enemy

3735
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:21,280
because the combat system is so like

3736
02:53:21,280 --> 02:53:24,760
it's so rigid in the sense that you

3737
02:53:24,760 --> 02:53:26,400
randomly encounter enemies you have to

3738
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:29,240
fight within within that realm of your

3739
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:32,040
enemy versus your characters I mean I'm

3740
02:53:32,040 --> 02:53:33,880
going I'm using Final Fantasy 7 as a

3741
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:35,560
frame of reference but you get the idea

3742
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:39,200
that the way like but that's the like it

3743
02:53:39,200 --> 02:53:41,880
you know I'll do like Squeenix was just

3744
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:43,760
thinking outside the box and applying

3745
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:45,720
what they've already done best why can't

3746
02:53:45,720 --> 02:53:47,520
people just like what they like let's

3747
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,360
just like what we like and leave people

3748
02:53:49,360 --> 02:53:51,720
alone well I mean I don't understand why

3749
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:53,680
he's got it you know some people like

3750
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:56,480
the Japanese stuff and let it be but I

3751
02:53:56,480 --> 02:53:57,600
don't think just because you like one

3752
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:59,280
Japanese game means you love them all or

3753
02:53:59,280 --> 02:54:01,000
just because you love Jeff all Japanese

3754
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:02,400
games there's gonna be a few you hate

3755
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,520
you know I don't know just it's just way

3756
02:54:04,520 --> 02:54:06,240
too broad of a statement and I'm hoping

3757
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:08,000
this is just media sensationalism here

3758
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:09,720
that we're only perpetuating with this

3759
02:54:09,720 --> 02:54:12,320
call because I I would really just hope

3760
02:54:12,320 --> 02:54:16,600

02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:19,400

bit they say it's just point-and-click

3817

3818
02:57:15,480 --> 02:57:17,160
every now and again that you're gonna do

3819
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:19,200

and stuff man for the show I gave like I

3838
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:24,400
gave Jim Sally a name for his show

3839
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:26,760
because Jim Sally suggested he be the

3840
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:29,000
opener for the opener like he could open

3841
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,200
for Bobby which I don't consider Bobby an

3842
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:32,920
opener I consider him a cohead liner but

3843
02:58:32,920 --> 02:58:34,660
since he calls himself an opener I'll go

3844
02:58:34,660 --> 02:58:36,580
with that Jim Sally said he could be the

3845
02:58:36,580 --> 02:58:38,160
opener for the opener but I said well

3846
02:58:38,160 --> 02:58:39,780
Jim I think you would be better as the

3847
02:58:39,780 --> 02:58:41,760
closer and you could be pillow talk with

3848
02:58:41,760 --> 02:58:43,760
Jim Sally like right as we go off the

3849
02:58:43,760 --> 02:58:45,340

comic or written book and bugging my

3862
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:21,840
wife also wrote I I would love to see

3863
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:24,360
like a role play bit like an old-school

3864
02:59:24,360 --> 02:59:27,400
tabletop gaming and it could be larping

3865
02:59:27,400 --> 02:59:29,800
Dungeons & Dragons and I love love love

3866
02:59:29,800 --> 02:59:33,440
so do this I love love love the idea of

3867
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:37,160
a game that is podcast like somebody

3868
02:59:37,160 --> 02:59:39,040
who's not sure that would be difficult

3869
02:59:39,040 --> 02:59:40,600
somebody who's actually running a game

3870
02:59:40,600 --> 02:59:42,560
to be podcast it's done everyone at the

3871
02:59:42,560 --> 02:59:45,720
table would need a microphone now I get

3872
02:59:45,720 --> 02:59:48,600
some good food mics well that or and

3873
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:51,960
you'd have to have the die cam you see

3874
02:59:51,960 --> 02:59:53,280
them rolling and see who's cheating at

3875
02:59:53,280 --> 02:59:55,280
the table oh and I didn't nudge that

3876
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:58,640
that was I sneezed Jamie just rolled a

3877
02:59:58,640 --> 03:00:02,520
seven on the 20-sided die so this means

3878
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:04,360
that she has failed her intelligence

3879
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:13,760
check please which would be really sad given that you know if I failed an

3880
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:17,840
intelligence check with a seven given that I know okay that's really giving it

3881
03:00:17,840 --> 03:00:19,840
away but but for real although I will say

3882
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:21,840
this as much as I am teasing Jim Sally

3883
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:22,940
with the idea of starting his own show

3884
03:00:22,940 --> 03:00:24,840
involved we do like to look for

3885
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:27,280
established shows we we want something

3886
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:29,320
to kind of go off of like we need a

3887
03:00:29,320 --> 03:00:30,800
couple episodes under your belt so we

3888
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:32,320
know you're serious about it because we

3889
03:00:32,320 --> 03:00:33,760
are not looking for shows that are gonna

3890
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:35,920
do it for two weeks and then quit that

3891
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:38,280
would be the problem so anyhow anyhow

3892
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:40,160
why don't you leave the microphone on

3893
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:41,760
today when you leave but I'll go do some

3894
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:44,680

app I would go download it the worst are

3941
03:03:07,560 --> 03:03:09,640
the ones with the gigantic splash screen

3942
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:11,240
so obviously tiger claw linked me to a

3943
03:03:11,240 --> 03:03:13,160
game spot article oh but there's a call

3944
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:14,400

3945
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:16,360
and see what it's about

3946
03:03:16,360 --> 03:03:18,300

03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:21,560

up stir luck not too much I don't know

3950
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:34,560
if you talked about the Vita firmware

3951
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:37,560
update in part a I kind of missed a lot

3952
03:03:37,560 --> 03:03:39,480
of it briefly it let off our rapid-fire

3953
03:03:39,480 --> 03:03:42,200
news tonight but go ahead it was we talk

3954
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:43,560
quickly about it so what do you want to

3955
03:03:43,560 --> 03:03:46,600
say about it um well it kind of makes me

3956
03:03:46,600 --> 03:03:49,480
want a Vita now what what a firmware

3957
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:51,120
update makes you want a Vita what is it

3958
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:52,360
about the firmware update that makes you

3959
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:54,960
want it because they added a feature

3960
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:57,160
that should have been in there from the

3961
03:03:57,160 --> 03:04:01,680
beginning which is use of the buttons in

3962
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:04,640
the home screen which you would think

3963
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:06,640
would have been in there by default but

3964
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:08,880
I don't know what the hell so he was

3965
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:10,760
thinking now something the listeners may

3966
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:12,480
not remember about you from previous

3967
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:14,080
phone calls to the show but you're blind

3968
03:04:14,080 --> 03:04:16,720
right yep so this is something that is

3969
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:19,080
kind of important if you're trying to

3970
03:04:19,080 --> 03:04:22,760
navigate that was literally I was pretty

3971
03:04:22,760 --> 03:04:24,280
stoked for the Vita when I heard about

3972
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:26,040
some of the games that were coming to it

3973
03:04:26,040 --> 03:04:31,160
especially like Mortal Kombat something

3974
03:04:31,160 --> 03:04:34,240
like sound shapes too is awesome you know

3975
03:04:34,240 --> 03:04:36,560
I think I think even being you know with

3976
03:04:36,560 --> 03:04:38,560
blind the way you kind of interact with

3977
03:04:38,560 --> 03:04:40,120
the sounds and the fact that the sounds

3978
03:04:40,120 --> 03:04:41,800
kind of drive the stage a little bit I

3979
03:04:41,800 --> 03:04:44,320
think you'd get a kick out of it um okay

3980
03:04:44,320 --> 03:04:48,280
to have um how prevalent is the

3981
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:49,720
touchscreen and sound chips I don't

3982
03:04:49,720 --> 03:04:51,280
really done a lot of research into it or

3983
03:04:51,280 --> 03:04:52,800
is it all button-based you don't have to

3984
03:04:52,800 --> 03:04:54,480
use it at all if you want to design

3985
03:04:54,480 --> 03:04:56,360
stages you have to use it a little bit

3986
03:04:56,360 --> 03:04:58,840
but if you interesting when I have to

3987
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:00,640
check that one out I think I think you

3988
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:02,440
get a kick out of it I'm also a big fan

3989
03:05:02,440 --> 03:05:05,720
of the Riven rhythm heaven slash Tengoku

3990
03:05:05,720 --> 03:05:12,560
series on the GBA and DS and we most

3991
03:05:12,560 --> 03:05:14,600
recently those are pretty awesome do you

3992
03:05:14,600 --> 03:05:17,360
think that maybe Sony realized you know

3993
03:05:17,360 --> 03:05:19,440
oops we're not really being

3994
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:22,080
accommodating all people I know some

3995
03:05:22,080 --> 03:05:24,760
people that did send letters to them

3996
03:05:24,760 --> 03:05:28,880
about it and not all of them being blind

3997
03:05:28,880 --> 03:05:31,200
I've heard even a lot of sighted people

3998
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:35,160
bitching so it's it's not just a blind

3999
03:05:35,160 --> 03:05:37,280
thing it's a convenience thing also it is

4000
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:39,480
true like sometimes you don't like you

4001
03:05:39,480 --> 03:05:42,000
don't need to be all touchy-feely with

4002
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,120
the game system like sometimes it's it's

4003
03:05:44,120 --> 03:05:46,800
fine to let me put it this way I like my

4004
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:49,000
buttons one of the bitches I had about

4005
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,240
sound shapes on the Vita was that it

4006
03:05:51,240 --> 03:05:54,280
wasn't nearly as precise on the Vita in

4007
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:56,600
in the design phase the game phase is

4008
03:05:56,600 --> 03:05:58,360
fine but the design phase isn't nearly

4009
03:05:58,360 --> 03:05:59,840
as precise on the Vita because you have

4010
03:05:59,840 --> 03:06:01,920
to use like that back touch panel to

4011
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:03,920
like stretch things and you know put

4012
03:06:03,920 --> 03:06:05,720
them where you want and stuff and it

4013
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:07,640
kind of stinks but when you play on the

4014
03:06:07,640 --> 03:06:09,760
PlayStation 3 you can use the controller

4015
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:12,040
and you get that precision much more

4016
03:06:12,040 --> 03:06:14,480
with the analog sticks yeah yeah it's

4017
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:17,040
much better so that was you know pretty

4018
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:20,520
awesome a bitch of mine so yeah all

4019
03:06:20,520 --> 03:06:22,160
right well stir lock anything else you

4020
03:06:22,160 --> 03:06:25,000
want to share a listeners tonight um I

4021
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,440
don't know I was just having random

4022
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:30,760
thoughts actually I don't remember where

4023
03:06:30,760 --> 03:06:33,160
I found it now but Jim Sally was talking

4024
03:06:33,160 --> 03:06:36,440
about like D&D sessions and like podcast

4025
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:38,320
worm I've seen that done before and it's

4026
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:40,040
pretty awesome it is it is I would love

4027
03:06:40,040 --> 03:06:42,280
to get a show like that on that would be

4028
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:45,160
funny though like doing the whole you

4029
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:47,720
know World Series of Poker style

4030
03:06:47,720 --> 03:06:50,000
commentary like Dark Sakura has deployed

4031
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:53,560
her 20-sided die she's currently

4032
03:06:53,560 --> 03:06:58,400
attempting her saving throw I was low

4033
03:06:58,400 --> 03:07:02,680
and she didn't quite make it I would

4034
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:04,560
love it but you know we'll have to we'll

4035
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:05,720
have to see what's out there because you

4036
03:07:05,720 --> 03:07:07,560
know as Bobby's emphasizing in chat we

4037
03:07:07,560 --> 03:07:09,220
are kind of looking for shows that are

4038
03:07:09,220 --> 03:07:11,640
already you know because we don't really

4039
03:07:11,640 --> 03:07:13,240
want to bring on show again it's all

4040
03:07:13,240 --> 03:07:14,680
about you know people might have an idea

4041
03:07:14,680 --> 03:07:16,320
and like oh I want to do this I want to

4042
03:07:16,320 --> 03:07:18,240
do this but then they don't realize how

4043
03:07:18,240 --> 03:07:20,400
hard it really is there's a lot of work

4044
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:23,240
that goes into it is doing something I

4045
03:07:23,240 --> 03:07:27,640

03:07:27,640 --> 03:07:32,320

03:08:59,560 --> 03:09:03,040
release battlefield 3 mod tools they

4084
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:06,840
said at GDC Europe that apparently the

4085
03:09:06,840 --> 03:09:09,120
studio was fearful of the implications

4086
03:09:09,120 --> 03:09:12,200
of releasing the mod tools let's see they

4087
03:09:12,200 --> 03:09:14,160
were quote and this is a quote from

4088
03:09:14,160 --> 03:09:17,360
Magnus Trudson who is the general

4089
03:09:17,360 --> 03:09:21,160
manager of dice said quote afraid of all

4090
03:09:21,160 --> 03:09:23,400
the things that can come with releasing

4091
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:26,640
the code quote if we do mod support we

4092
03:09:26,640 --> 03:09:28,880
want to do it really really well we are

4093
03:09:28,880 --> 03:09:32,120
not ready to do this yet interesting I

4094
03:09:32,120 --> 03:09:34,520
guess oh and also that if the mods come

4095
03:09:34,520 --> 03:09:37,120
out they want console players in two I

4096
03:09:37,120 --> 03:09:38,800
think that part's kind of interesting as

4097
03:09:38,800 --> 03:09:40,120
well is that they don't want to just

4098
03:09:40,120 --> 03:09:42,560
just let it be for PC they want console

4099
03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:44,480
players to get in on the fun that's kind

4100
03:09:44,480 --> 03:09:48,720
of nice pretty cool all right I have a

4101
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:50,840

you there live dot vog network calm are

4113
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:15,720
you guys excited about Borderlands 2 I

4114
03:10:15,720 --> 03:10:19,480
don't even have to ask Loki I I don't

4115
03:10:19,480 --> 03:10:21,040
know if excited is the right word but

4116
03:10:21,040 --> 03:10:23,280
I'm highly curious about Borderlands 2

4117
03:10:23,280 --> 03:10:24,840
because I liked what I played of

4118
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:27,400
Borderlands 1 I really need to play more

4119
03:10:27,400 --> 03:10:31,520
of it so yeah I'm I will check it out

4120
03:10:31,520 --> 03:10:33,280
and I like some of the things they're

4121
03:10:33,280 --> 03:10:35,240
doing with it I don't like that whole

4122
03:10:35,240 --> 03:10:36,960
mess earlier this week about the whole

4123
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:38,840
girlfriend mode and all that crap that

4124
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:40,480
was going around but I'm just gonna

4125
03:10:40,480 --> 03:10:43,720
chalk a lot of that up to the media and

4126
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:45,640
Twitter and the internet kind of

4127
03:10:45,640 --> 03:10:47,160
latching on to one thing and then

4128
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:49,000
running with it and it's not going to

4129
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:50,600
affect the quality of the game I think

4130
03:10:50,600 --> 03:10:52,400
at the end of the day the way that

4131
03:10:52,400 --> 03:10:54,200
they're doing like an easy mode tree

4132
03:10:54,200 --> 03:10:56,500
that sounds great to me that's not a

4133
03:10:56,500 --> 03:10:58,880
girlfriend mode that's a me mode and I

4134
03:10:58,880 --> 03:10:59,920
know there's a lot of people that feel

4135
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:01,880
the same way you know I don't mind

4136
03:11:01,880 --> 03:11:03,800
playing that the games on on an easier

4137
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:05,840
mode to get the story and the experience

4138
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:08,200
I'm actually planning on playing through

4139
03:11:08,200 --> 03:11:12,520
Mass Effect 3 on insanity good luck in

4140
03:11:12,520 --> 03:11:16,520
God though a good well then that's no

4141
03:11:16,520 --> 03:11:19,840
fair no all right and lastly also tell

4142
03:11:19,840 --> 03:11:21,440

03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:26,680
youtubes but then he didn't link it so

4145
03:11:26,680 --> 03:11:27,920

4146
03:11:27,920 --> 03:11:31,600
ratchet 1785 if it's not the same name I

4147

4158
03:11:57,600 --> 03:11:59,360
because thankfully we have the Dark

4159
03:11:59,360 --> 03:12:01,760
Siders 2 song in there so I think we're

4160
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:03,600

4161
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:04,640

03:12:04,640 --> 03:12:07,120
just gonna say retweet that thing

4163
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:09,960
that I tweeted about evil lot they're

4164
03:12:09,960 --> 03:12:12,000
having a contest on their site and

4165
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:13,640
whoever gets the most retweets gets a

4166
03:12:13,640 --> 03:12:16,040
picture drawn by one of the artists and

4167
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:18,560
she does really kick-ass art so I would

4168
03:12:18,560 --> 03:12:20,920
like I would like a picture because she

4169
03:12:20,920 --> 03:12:22,440
does like pixel art and it looks fucking

4170
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:24,200
