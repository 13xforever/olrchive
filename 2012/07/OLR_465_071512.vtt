00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
This is your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey!

00:14.000 --> 00:19.640
Tonight July 15th, 2012, a popular comic book character is getting his own game.

00:19.640 --> 00:25.280
One PC game claims an Apple IOS game stole from them without permission, and Amazon announces

00:25.280 --> 00:27.480
a new gaming service.

00:27.480 --> 00:35.280
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.280 --> 00:37.640
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.380
Yes, it's Orange Lounge Radio, just like the intro said.

00:40.380 --> 00:43.760
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about

00:43.760 --> 00:46.680
video games and all that fun stuff with my co-hosts.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.400
Joining me here, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
Hi.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.680
How are you, Jamie Summers?

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
Caffeinated.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
Welcome back.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
You weren't here last week.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.680
Feeling better?

00:55.680 --> 00:56.680
No.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.680
I was here last week.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.680
Sorry to hear it.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.800
I feel infinitely better this week.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
Glad to hear it.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
So, yes.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.160
And then you'll be gone next week?

01:04.160 --> 01:06.360
Yes, I will be at Tiara's wedding.

01:06.360 --> 01:10.160
You have a great time off program through the network, don't you?

01:10.160 --> 01:15.500
No, I suppose a wedding between two people that inadvertently met because of Orange Lounge

01:15.500 --> 01:18.040
Radio could be acceptable.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.040
Not really.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.320
We can't take that much credit, but sort of, sort of, a little bit.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.920
One thing leads to another.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.160
That's right.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.960
I'm also joining us here in studio.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.440
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.440
Hi.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
Hi, Loki.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
How are you?

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
Doing fine.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.840
Going through my spam and trying to delete 20 pages of spam.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.120
I hate spam.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.360
Why can't we, why can't the internet stop spam?

01:41.360 --> 01:42.360
That's what I want to know.

01:42.360 --> 01:49.040
Why won't Howie Mandel stop emailing me about, what is it?

01:49.040 --> 01:51.280
You've been selected to be on Deal or No Deal?

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
Oh, I know.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.560
I just keep ignoring him, you know, over and over.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.440
And here they really want me on Deal or No Deal.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.920
My favorite is on the mailbag address for the show here, mailbagandorangehouseradio.com.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.740
We get all this French spam.

02:04.740 --> 02:08.720
Like it's not just spam, it's un franÃ§ais.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.200
Like who signed us up for French spam?

02:11.200 --> 02:12.200
I hate you.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.200
I personally hate you.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.800
Let's see what else we got here.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.900
Are you losing money on your website?

02:16.900 --> 02:19.880
The 100% all natural metabolism booster.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.560
Incredibly low prices on 2011 cars.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.480
What does that have to, meh.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.200
Maybe that's how we can make money with VOG.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.040
Don't you kids want some metabolism boosters?

02:30.040 --> 02:34.840
How would you like to have a bigger dick?

02:34.840 --> 02:36.660
We sell them detachable.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.680
Is your car hurting your pocket?

02:38.680 --> 02:41.720
I can almost, I wish spammusement was still around because that would be hilarious.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.680
That was my favorite webcomic back in the day.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.400
Like with all due respect, screw Penny Arcade.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.280
Forget the oatmeal, it was all about spammusement back in the day.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.280
That was like the funniest.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
Get a bigger flute.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.960
Actually the site is still up, they just haven't updated it.

02:56.960 --> 02:57.960
I know.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.960
We should take it over.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.440
You are so good to me eggplant Mike.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.840
That was my favorite.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.480
All right, anyhow.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.840
Welcome to Internet Jokes from 2004.

03:06.840 --> 03:08.660
Hey, chat room.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.560

03:34.840 --> 03:37.520
Although, you can now check in to the podcast as well.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.520
That's been going for a couple weeks.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.700
I have a little more on that in a minute.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.760
But first, let's do tonight's kickoff topic.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.760
All right, so last week, Loki and I held down the fort without Dark Sakura.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.480
Somehow it still ended up being like an over three-hour show.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.680
It was probably that whole little debate we were having on theater.

03:54.680 --> 03:59.160
Oh, I didn't even remember that, but now I do.

03:59.160 --> 04:04.400
Yeah, that's what caused the show to go a little long, but that's all right.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.880
Anyhow, we were talking about theater and all that stuff, but one of the other things

04:08.880 --> 04:12.520
we talked about, towards the end of the show, kind of, like I don't want to say it's a throwaway,

04:12.520 --> 04:16.840
but it was one of those things we were like, oh, we hear about things like this all the

04:16.840 --> 04:17.840
time and whatever.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.360
And it was about this system, when we were joking, it was called the, oh yeah.

04:21.360 --> 04:25.120
Like, you remember, it's like the, we were looking at the name, we're like the oh yeah,

04:25.120 --> 04:28.760
the oo-yeah, the ow-yeah, how about, oh yeah.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.760
So we started calling it the oh yeah, and we were like, whatever.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.480
You know, we hear about these little consoles all the time.

04:35.480 --> 04:39.080
Well, a lot can change in the scope of a week.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.420
Turns out, we didn't know this last week when we reported on it, the whole thing ended up

04:42.420 --> 04:44.440
being a Kickstarter.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.920
And they Kickstarted, and they've gone through the roof of Kickstarter.

04:47.920 --> 04:53.880
They've already raised almost five million dollars on Kickstarter to date.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.720
And it's all for this console that technically doesn't exist yet.

04:57.720 --> 05:02.620
It's had a lot of interesting upsies and downsies going on, like for example, you know, obviously

05:02.620 --> 05:07.280
the up part is, you know, thousands of people are pre-ordering it, causing it to go through

05:07.280 --> 05:09.120
five million dollars.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.800
supporters just kicked back and made, what, about a quarter million dollars, half a million

05:12.800 --> 05:16.500
dollars off of them.

05:16.500 --> 05:21.480
The downs are that we don't really have an actual system.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.160
We have prototypes, imaginings.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.560
We also have screenshots of proposed things that will come to the system, and one of them

05:28.560 --> 05:34.920
is Minecraft, to which Notch, the guy behind Minecraft, came out and said, actually, no,

05:34.920 --> 05:36.520
we're not putting Minecraft on this.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.840
I mean, they might be talking about Minecraft Android Edition or whatever, but that sucks.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.600
We're not supporting it anymore.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.640
It's not going to be on Oya.

05:44.640 --> 05:50.720
And their response is basically, well, just tell these companies what you want.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.320
Tell them what you want, what you really, really want.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.800
And we'll magically get all these games to show up on the console.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.800
You know what?

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
I wanted a Phantom.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.080
My chances sound just as good.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
All right.

06:02.080 --> 06:10.240
Well, in a funny, interesting twist of fate, Loki, tell us about your story with this console

06:10.240 --> 06:11.240
this week.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.720
I backed it, right, as it came up.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.560
What made you decide that it's worth it?

06:17.560 --> 06:21.320
Because, I don't know, for some reason it just kind of surprised me.

06:21.320 --> 06:25.560
Because it's cheap, at the very least.

06:25.560 --> 06:30.800
Because it's so hackable, you know, if the console part of it just kind of fails and

06:30.800 --> 06:32.760
they do deliver on the product.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.640
I believe that there still will be stuff that will be supported on it.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.840
I think there's already a lot of games that would be supported on it, especially ones

06:38.840 --> 06:44.220
that support Bluetooth controllers and that kind of thing.

06:44.220 --> 06:45.220
So there's that.

06:45.220 --> 06:48.880
And then, of course, like I said, the hackable part where you could basically turn this into

06:48.880 --> 06:50.480
like a streaming box.

06:50.480 --> 06:58.800
Or if you want to go that far, you could say turn it into almost like a web TV type thing,

06:58.800 --> 07:02.920
where it's hooked up to your TV and you're, you know, checking Facebook, you know, Twitter,

07:02.920 --> 07:06.000
that kind of stuff on it.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.220
Because I don't really have anything like, I mean, let me put it this way.

07:09.220 --> 07:15.120
I've been using the Xbox 360 recently to watch YouTube for my son.

07:15.120 --> 07:19.500
We stream episodes of Caillou because they're like five minutes long.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.560
And that app fucking sucks.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.640
I have to reboot the app every time a video ends because it starts stuttering the next

07:26.640 --> 07:28.320
video.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.320
And it pisses me off.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.320
My phone doesn't have that problem.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.420
You know, our Nook tablet doesn't have that problem.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.280
My iPod doesn't have that problem.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.960
But this fucking app that they put out on an Xbox 360 just sucks balls.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.360
So I'd rather have something that would work for streaming, that kind of stuff.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.600
Or, you know, I don't necessarily want to dig out my PS3 or my 360 because it's not

07:48.600 --> 07:52.520
always hooked up to the TV to stream video from my computer.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.800
And then I could do that with, you know, an app, say, VLC player or something like that,

07:57.800 --> 07:59.200
using this device.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.040
So it could use it as a streaming device as well.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.560
I have something that does all of that and it didn't cost me anything.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.080
I have a computer hooked up to my TV that was just given to us because they were going

08:07.080 --> 08:08.080
to throw it away.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.080
It does all of that.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.080
Okay.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.080
Yes.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.080
I can go dumpster diving for a computer.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.080
I can use one of the millions of...

08:13.080 --> 08:14.080
It was given to me.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.080
I didn't dumpster dive for it.

08:15.080 --> 08:20.440
But to be fair, you are kind of dancing around the fact that there is a value to that.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.500
Somebody gave it to you for free because they like you.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.360
If you want to go out and get a computer...

08:24.360 --> 08:26.920
I could build the same thing for under a hundred bucks.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.200
Well, let's go down that road.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.800
Why not a PC?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.600
Why this box?

08:32.600 --> 08:33.600
I want to hear it out.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.840
I want to hear all sides to this because I don't know where I sit with this, honestly.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.680
I could build a PC and put it in there.

08:38.680 --> 08:43.700
But the thing is, I'd rather have something smaller and compact and it looks nice.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.840
And it could play games on it.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.080
Yeah, I could easily do that.

08:47.080 --> 08:51.400
Or I could just stick with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and not have to pay anything

08:51.400 --> 08:54.360
to have it stream to my TV.

08:54.360 --> 08:59.400
But at the same time, I can use this... a PC, for example, you're going to need a keyboard

08:59.400 --> 09:02.440
mouse to interact with it.

09:02.440 --> 09:07.440
And that's kind of cumbersome when I want to be kind of wireless from this whole PC

09:07.440 --> 09:08.440
thing.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.200
I mean, sure, I could get a wireless mouse and keyboard, and I've done that before.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
We've had...

09:12.200 --> 09:17.280
I was going to say, back in the OLR mansion, when you and I lived together, we actually

09:17.280 --> 09:21.600
had a computer hooked up to the TV that we used to feed chat room to the living room,

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
remember?

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
Yeah.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.960
And it was in the arcade cabinet.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.440
So it served like a double purpose.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.880
Or I could wheel out the arcade cabinet that I have into the living room, but I don't really

09:30.880 --> 09:32.000
want to do that.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.700
Well, like, our computer that's hooked up to our TV is in an unobtrusive location.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.920
You can't really... you don't really notice it unless you're looking down at it.

09:41.920 --> 09:48.120
You know, we've got the remote... our keyboard is one of those little clamshell things that

09:48.120 --> 09:49.660
Logitech puts out.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.720
And it's completely unobtrusive.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.480
We watch full movies on it in HD quality.

09:54.480 --> 09:58.320
You know, never have any lag unless it's the internet that's lagging.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.320
You know, we've played games on it too.

10:00.320 --> 10:05.160
Dan's got emulators hooked up to it, penmame, you know, all kinds of stuff.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.720
And I mean, it would run most of the stuff that's on Steam right now.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.400
You know, especially the indie games.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.080
And on top of that, you know, if any of our friends wants to bring over a computer and

10:15.080 --> 10:17.040
hook it up to our TV, the connections are there.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.200
Just change out the wires.

10:19.200 --> 10:25.040
We don't have to buy a vapor, something that doesn't exist and probably won't be worth

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
the money.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.520
How do you feel about Apple TV?

10:28.520 --> 10:29.720
I'm not investing in that either.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.760
I have a PC.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.360
I was just curious because to me, there's a lot of similarities between the two, except

10:35.360 --> 10:38.560
one of them is not coming from a little indie company.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.480
It's coming from, you know, the biggest company in America or one or two.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.480
I don't know.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.080
Them and Exxon keep flip flopping, but whatever, you get my point.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.680
You know, one of them is coming from the biggest company anywhere.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.720
And the other one is, you know, this company nobody's heard of, but essentially they're

10:51.720 --> 10:53.260
kind of the same thing.

10:53.260 --> 10:58.480
It's just that Apple TV doesn't do games yet, but I think we all know that will be built

10:58.480 --> 10:59.480
in eventually.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.600
I mean, there's...

11:01.600 --> 11:06.080
And then it's just going to be the Apple fans versus the anti-Apple crowd all over again.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.520
I think there's a lot of like startups and stuff, and everybody seems to focus on the

11:09.520 --> 11:15.160
Phantom and consoles of that sort that flopped because, you know, they don't know who these

11:15.160 --> 11:16.160
people are.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.040
But the guy that's doing the design is behind that, you know, one laptop per child.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.300
That wasn't vaporware.

11:22.300 --> 11:26.040
People were paying money for that, you know, to get a $50 laptop or whatever, and that

11:26.040 --> 11:28.100
ended up, you know, turning out just fine.

11:28.100 --> 11:32.000
So he has a little bit of credit, you know, he has a little bit of a, you know, reputation

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
to uphold there.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.040
With something established and tangible.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.580
Yes, I understand that, but it wasn't when people were ordering it.

11:38.580 --> 11:39.580
It wasn't made yet.

11:39.580 --> 11:40.580
It was just...

11:40.580 --> 11:41.600
But laptops existed at the time.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.600
I understand that.

11:42.600 --> 11:47.560
To be able to create a laptop that's that cheap with, you know, parts, it was very customized.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.120
I mean, try building a laptop for 50 bucks.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.120
Good luck.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.120
Been done.

11:52.120 --> 11:55.560
All right, let's see this laptop that you've done.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.080
Well, I'm not building them.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.280
I'm just saying that people have been doing it.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.280
To be fair.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.440
You make it sound like it's so goddamn fucking easy to find a $50 laptop.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.560
Let me just pull one out of my asshole right here.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.560
Let me jump in.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.560
Just be...

12:06.560 --> 12:09.280
I truly do feel like I'm neutral on this topic.

12:09.280 --> 12:13.220
I kinda want one, but I gotta see it in action first.

12:13.220 --> 12:17.400
And I don't wanna see theories and maybes, impossibilities.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.780
I want it on the E3 show floor.

12:19.780 --> 12:24.300
And I want it to be the public to give an honest opinion on it.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.360
That's where I'm at.

12:25.360 --> 12:31.080
But I'm not quite in the camp of no way, no how, never, either, or that it's like a waste.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.080
I'm kind of in between.

12:32.080 --> 12:37.880
But to be fair, I have heard these stories about the kids in countries where they don't

12:37.880 --> 12:42.240
have a lot of money in the education system, about that there are these charity programs

12:42.240 --> 12:47.400
that are getting these super cheap laptops that are like $75, $100 in these classrooms.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.800
Yes, that's that laptop.

12:48.800 --> 12:49.800
Yeah, that...

12:49.800 --> 12:55.280
I mean, so they're not great, but to say, yes, there is a such thing as a $100 laptop,

12:55.280 --> 12:57.800
but they're not exactly gonna do much, but...

12:57.800 --> 13:03.640
You can buy a smartphone for, you know, $75 to $100, it may not be like all the things

13:03.640 --> 13:09.200
that my iPhone are, but it'll do all the same stuff the laptop will.

13:09.200 --> 13:14.700
I mean, if they can put them in a phone, they can build a laptop.

13:14.700 --> 13:18.800
But those phones you're talking about, unless they're prepaid phones, and trust me, $75

13:18.800 --> 13:20.880
prepaid phones are not good phones.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.280
Dan's last Android phone was like $100.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.200
Yeah, but was that with a contract?

13:24.200 --> 13:28.800
Going down this road a minute, though, the Ouya, the Ouya kind of is a phone, isn't it?

13:28.800 --> 13:32.960
I mean, Android is a phone and tablet operating system.

13:32.960 --> 13:38.640
Basically, it's got the same specs or very similar specs to the new quad-core processor

13:38.640 --> 13:40.320
tablet that they have coming out.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.960
So it's like a tablet that's hooked up to a TV.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.880
Would it be correct to say that basically what Ouya is gonna do is it's gonna be a smartphone

13:47.880 --> 13:49.880
on your TV without the phone calls?

13:49.880 --> 13:53.320
It's gonna be a tablet on your TV without...

13:53.320 --> 13:57.520
And without touchscreen capability, which all these games run on.

13:57.520 --> 14:02.840
Which I'm okay with, actually, because I'm over touchscreen games.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.560
And you were talking about this during Bobby's show when Bobby was kind of grilling you on

14:06.560 --> 14:07.560
this too.

14:07.560 --> 14:11.680
You were mentioning like you wanna play some of these games that are on like PC and stuff

14:11.680 --> 14:12.680
right now.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.560
Let's say a game like Terraria, but you wanna play it with a controller on your TV the way

14:16.560 --> 14:17.560
games are meant to be played.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.520
I have a controller that I use for Steam that isn't...

14:20.520 --> 14:22.800
But not every game supports it.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.520
So?

14:24.520 --> 14:25.520
And I...

14:25.520 --> 14:26.520
We don't always get what we want.

14:26.520 --> 14:31.360
I can understand the angle of wanting to play things on your couch in the living room as

14:31.360 --> 14:33.320
opposed to in your...

14:33.320 --> 14:37.360
It would be hypocritical of me to say I don't understand that viewpoint because I've purposely

14:37.360 --> 14:41.520
bought games on the console because I want to plop my fat ass on the couch, kick back,

14:41.520 --> 14:43.680
and have my Xbox controller and play.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.320
There's plenty of games I've wanted to play on the console, but it's just not realistic

14:46.320 --> 14:48.880
to do it.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.200
Especially in my case since I physically have a problem with it.

14:52.200 --> 14:56.820
But I mean, I could have gone out and paid...

14:56.820 --> 15:02.880
For example, I could have bought Mass Effect for $12 or paid $5 like I did for it.

15:02.880 --> 15:08.560
Or $11 for the two games together on Amazon sale and get the collector's edition and play

15:08.560 --> 15:11.280
through all kinds of ways of it.

15:11.280 --> 15:16.500
If I wanted to play Sonic CD, yeah, I could go with all the trouble and hook up my Sega

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
CD.

15:17.500 --> 15:22.360
Or I could play it on Steam where I bought it and play a much better version with the

15:22.360 --> 15:23.840
good music.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.360
Bobby?

15:25.360 --> 15:29.880
Let me go down this path then because we could probably have this debate all night, but there's

15:29.880 --> 15:32.520
other stuff we want to cover.

15:32.520 --> 15:37.120
Five million dollars has been raised in a week, less than a week.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.320
You can't deny that's a huge deal.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.180
Whether you support it or not, that's a huge deal.

15:43.180 --> 15:48.900
My question is, what is the possible, if any, long-term impact on the next gaming cycle?

15:48.900 --> 15:54.960
Do you think Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo is looking at this going, huh?

15:54.960 --> 15:58.240
Or do you think, eh, don't care, we could step on these guys?

15:58.240 --> 16:00.800
They're looking at it going, no one care.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.520
I don't think they care at all.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
Interesting.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.560
But, here's the thing though.

16:06.560 --> 16:11.660
If you, this does become popular, because I mean, I'm not going to say 50,000 consoles

16:11.660 --> 16:17.560
or even, I don't even know, 80,000 consoles, it's not necessarily going to be a big splash.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.920
I mean, it's good for what it is.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.400
But let's say it gives developers an alternative.

16:24.400 --> 16:29.040
They can say, you know what, I don't want to try to get my stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.440
I don't want to try to get myself, you know, on the WiiWare service or whatever they're

16:33.440 --> 16:35.320
calling it for the Wii U.

16:35.320 --> 16:40.000
I don't want to try to, you know, have to negotiate these really crazy deals or, you

16:40.000 --> 16:43.200
know, even licensing with these publishers because they're going to try to have too much

16:43.200 --> 16:47.300
creative control or, you know, whatever.

16:47.300 --> 16:52.200
I'm just going to put my stuff out on Android and then I'm also going to cater it to this

16:52.200 --> 16:56.160
console so I can get my game on a console.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.520
And yeah, you can do it with Xbox indie games and stuff like that and I really wish there

16:59.520 --> 17:02.540
was more services like that because that would be awesome.

17:02.540 --> 17:07.360
But there's not, so, you know, kind of have to, you know, that's why you have all these

17:07.360 --> 17:11.760
companies going and saying, hey, fuck this, we're going to Kickstarter, we're going to,

17:11.760 --> 17:16.520
we want to make this game genre, you know, that is not popular with publishers.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.480
That's why you see some of these games going to Kickstarter.

17:19.480 --> 17:25.260
I do think the success this thing is seeing so far without there even being a product

17:25.260 --> 17:32.280
to touch is obviously people are very into the dream of what they can do with this console.

17:32.280 --> 17:38.600
And for me, it's a very loud statement against some of the things we've heard about the next

17:38.600 --> 17:44.360
series of consoles, such as you won't be able to play used games, it'll be digital only.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.660
You know, whether these facts are true or not, there are things that have been kicked

17:47.660 --> 17:53.720
around there in the internet about these next rounds of consoles and have caused a lot of

17:53.720 --> 17:54.960
reaction.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.840
And you know what we always say, if you want to make the biggest statement possible, vote

17:58.840 --> 17:59.840
with your wallet.

17:59.840 --> 18:07.220
Well, in a way, now that we have this console out that is basically saying, we are the antithesis,

18:07.220 --> 18:13.280
we don't even exist, but we are promising that we will not be that console you all are

18:13.280 --> 18:20.040
dreading in the future, and they've raised $5 million like that, that's a big statement

18:20.040 --> 18:23.640
to me from the internet.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.900
And that's the only thing I think I would be worried about if I was Nintendo, Sony,

18:27.900 --> 18:32.840
or Xbox is that whether you personally agree with it or not, people are voting with their

18:32.840 --> 18:36.000
wallets right now.

18:36.000 --> 18:42.480
Now, granted $5 million is probably a kick in the bucket with Microsoft, but still, here's

18:42.480 --> 18:47.360
the other thing too, I mean, I completely forgot, you know, didn't even consider this,

18:47.360 --> 18:52.520
Game Guru brings up, what if Google released a $99 Android console, especially if this

18:52.520 --> 18:56.680
does well, can you imagine the power of Google saying, hey, you know what, we're going to

18:56.680 --> 19:00.360
take that cool little tablet that we made and we're going to just put it into a console.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.800
Well, technically, I mean, they did, they created that stupid sphere looking thing that

19:03.800 --> 19:07.560
you can now get, but that's $300, you know, for streaming content.

19:07.560 --> 19:11.800
But what if they were to do something similar to that, saying, hey, now you can game on

19:11.800 --> 19:17.640
your couch, you can, you know, you can game with this console, you can, you know, Facebook,

19:17.640 --> 19:23.600
all the stuff that you can do with like WebTV, all in this wonderful console that's low price

19:23.600 --> 19:29.040
and you get access to the Android marketplace and that kind of stuff.

19:29.040 --> 19:34.960
Alright, going to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, Brakeman says, Microsoft is looking at the

19:34.960 --> 19:38.920
Ouya and thinking about running a company contest to see who can make the most fun of

19:38.920 --> 19:40.280
it.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.840
You know, one thing Microsoft does very well is they take other people's ideas and make

19:44.840 --> 19:47.040
them better and then release it.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.480
That's, that's one thing Microsoft's been doing for quite a while.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.360
And some might debate me on that point, but that's another thing I think Microsoft would

19:55.360 --> 19:58.160
be looking at this going, hmm.

19:58.160 --> 20:03.320
But I mean, the whole free to play model, if I understand correctly, it's no different

20:03.320 --> 20:06.240
from Xbox Live's model right now.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.800
It's not necessarily that all games are free to play forever.

20:09.800 --> 20:15.380
It's just that all games have to have a free to play download that you can unlock all levels

20:15.380 --> 20:17.960
for five bucks or whatever they go with it.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.520
Well, here's the thing too.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.840
You know, on Kotaku this week, they've been having their little discussions about the

20:23.840 --> 20:25.800
Ouya and that kind of stuff.

20:25.800 --> 20:30.280
It's seriously, it's just every single one is just talking people, trying to talk people

20:30.280 --> 20:33.640
out of buying one or backing it or something like that.

20:33.640 --> 20:38.680
And one of their concerns was piracy, which yes, piracy does exist.

20:38.680 --> 20:41.440
Probably quite prevalent on the Android marketplace.

20:41.440 --> 20:46.720
Has that stopped games from doing well on, you know, Android?

20:46.720 --> 20:47.720
No.

20:47.720 --> 20:52.280
And then also the way they're kind of doing these games right now is, you know, they make

20:52.280 --> 20:55.180
it a little bit harder to just simply pirate something.

20:55.180 --> 20:58.020
They have, you know, the in app purchases.

20:58.020 --> 21:02.320
So basically you have to download this free to play version and then you unlock it within

21:02.320 --> 21:03.320
the app.

21:03.320 --> 21:07.920
So that would be a little bit harder to crack than just say, you know, I'm gonna buy this

21:07.920 --> 21:13.400
$5 game and here's the full version, you know, APK file or something like that for it.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.600
So there's that, I guess.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.080
That's a little bit helpful.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.160
All right.

21:20.160 --> 21:23.760
There was another comment that was made early on that I thought was pretty accurate.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.640
Brakeman also said this at live.vognetware.com, when Loki's son reaches eight, he will be

21:28.640 --> 21:32.600
the coolest kid in the neighborhood because his dad will have the coolest shit.

21:32.600 --> 21:37.840
You basically said you're buying this to entertain your son with in a large way, kind of.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.080
Myself really.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.680
But if it helps to watch the kid too, then hey, right?

21:43.680 --> 21:51.560
Well yeah, I mean, cause you know, he likes his Caillou, his Canadian children's television.

21:51.560 --> 21:56.680
I wasn't sure if I wanted to go here with this other, I mean, it's not in tonight's

21:56.680 --> 22:02.160
show role, but it's another Kickstarter and this one, this one's a tricky one.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.160
You know what's funny?

22:03.160 --> 22:06.720
I got a text message this week and I forgot to reply to it cause I received it while I

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
was dead asleep.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
I should probably reply to it now.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
It's been three days later.

22:09.720 --> 22:15.600
But one of my friends texted me saying, hey, what's OLR's aversion to crowdsourced funding?

22:15.600 --> 22:19.080
OMG, hope I'm not waking you up, although they did wake me up and I forgot to reply

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
because of it.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.720
But what is the aversion to crowdsource funding?

22:21.720 --> 22:26.320
I don't necessarily have an aversion to crowdsource funding, but I just, there's a lot of things

22:26.320 --> 22:29.600
that make me very nervous about Kickstarter.

22:29.600 --> 22:36.080
And I think is that A, Kickstarter pockets a large chunk of change from, I mean, 5% out

22:36.080 --> 22:38.640
of 5 million is a large chunk of change.

22:38.640 --> 22:43.760
But let's be honest here, it's not any different than doing PayPal donations, PayPal pockets

22:43.760 --> 22:45.120
a large chunk of that too.

22:45.120 --> 22:50.900
I'm not sure everybody, well, let me, let me simplify it this way.

22:50.900 --> 22:57.120
An artist once said around 1996, Mo money, Mo problems.

22:57.120 --> 23:01.120
And I think that's what a lot of people get into is they don't, you know, they're, they're

23:01.120 --> 23:04.520
asking for this money, but I think sometimes not everybody necessarily knows how to spend

23:04.520 --> 23:05.520
that money.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.200
They think they know how to spend it.

23:07.200 --> 23:12.400
But then a lot of these Kickstarters are making way over the amount that they're asking for.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.440
And I'm not sure people know what to do with that money.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.960
Like one of Kickstarter's biggest problems is they need to have a place where you actually

23:17.960 --> 23:19.340
stop making money.

23:19.340 --> 23:23.600
Like they need to, maybe this is built in, I've just never seen it.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.600
No, they don't have that.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.120
They have stretch goals.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.360
That's weird to me.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.360
And of course, why would Kickstarter want to put that in?

23:29.360 --> 23:32.160
If you're making a runaway money, they're getting 5% of it all.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.520
They want you to make millions.

23:34.520 --> 23:39.760
But you know, I expressed vocal descent one time and I hate doing this because it was

23:39.760 --> 23:45.840
another podcast, but I have to openly ask, why does a podcast need to raise?

23:45.840 --> 23:47.160
What the hell were they asking for?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.880
They in all, they had raised six digits.

23:49.880 --> 23:54.160
This podcast raised something like $180,000 and I don't have it in front of me.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.200
I'll look it up in a minute here.

23:56.200 --> 24:00.960
And they had said it was because they had a, they were going to have a studio space

24:00.960 --> 24:08.380
and all this stuff that they need to revive their podcast, which was how many episodes

24:08.380 --> 24:09.380
before that?

24:09.380 --> 24:10.920
I think it was like maybe a year.

24:10.920 --> 24:11.920
Yeah.

24:11.920 --> 24:15.120
And I personally found that to be insulting as a podcaster.

24:15.120 --> 24:20.820
I found it to be insulting that if you want to podcast, you need money to do it.

24:20.820 --> 24:24.840
That much money anyway, because you really don't.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.080
You need a little money.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.080
Sure.

24:27.080 --> 24:31.000
If you want to make the reunion happen, you just fucking do it.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.080
You don't force people to pay $100,000 to have it done.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.080
That's insulting.

24:36.080 --> 24:41.600
A perfect example of a podcast raising money, um, for a legitimate purpose.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.040
There was this, um, it was a mom gamers podcast.

24:45.040 --> 24:50.280
They wanted to raise $500 for new mics and better equipment so they could do their podcast.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.280
That was it.

24:51.280 --> 24:54.760
And of course they raised it pretty quick because it's only $500 and that's all they

24:54.760 --> 24:59.200
were asking for because that's what you need to run a podcast.

24:59.200 --> 25:06.400
You just, you know, just the necessities, mics and you know, recording equipment.

25:06.400 --> 25:12.040
This podcast raised over $130,000 and they were asking for $30,000.

25:12.040 --> 25:20.200
They needed $30,000 to do a podcast and I kind of thought that was horseshit, sorry.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.560
That was, I want this to be a paying job, but people bought into it.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.800
I guess the quality of the show is good enough.

25:26.800 --> 25:30.480
People are that attached to it or people paid five times over.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.160
So hats off.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.160
Congrats.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.160
You made it work.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.160
You found the answer.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.160
How to make money off podcasting.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.160
Congrats.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.200
I hope the profit was worth it.

25:40.200 --> 25:45.160
I want to make very clear, very clear, explicitly clear.

25:45.160 --> 25:50.120
I am not talking about the all games Kickstarter because I realized people are thinking, oh,

25:50.120 --> 25:51.520
I'm going to go there.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.440
All games had a different plan in mind.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.680
They wanted to make a full network.

25:55.680 --> 26:01.180
Personally, I don't think they needed $45,000, but that's neither here nor there.

26:01.180 --> 26:02.280
It's a done deal now.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.560
I still would support them in that effort.

26:04.560 --> 26:08.160
I understand why they thought big and I can respect that.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.760
Dream big or go home, right?

26:10.760 --> 26:12.460
That's what they did.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.600
My previous rant was not about that.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.600
So don't start shit.

26:16.600 --> 26:22.480
Anyhow, that wasn't even the thing I wanted to talk about.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.480
Damn.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.480
Anyways, let's talk about penny.

26:24.480 --> 26:25.480
Yes.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.560
I want to talk about the penny arcade Kickstarter.

26:27.560 --> 26:32.500
You know exactly where I was going with this.

26:32.500 --> 26:37.000
So their Kickstarter was to remove advertising off their website to remove ads from their

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
website is, and I'm trying to bring it up right here.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.480
Penny arcade wants to raise, and this one was really interesting.

26:46.480 --> 26:53.240
They really thought about this because they made the goal $250,000, but that's only to

26:53.240 --> 26:56.800
get rid of one ad on the site.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.660
If you want to get rid of all the ads, they got to make 999, 9999.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.560
It's a million, basically $1 short of a million.

27:03.560 --> 27:13.040
If they raise that much on Kickstarter, they're going to do all of penny arcade ad free.

27:13.040 --> 27:16.560
There's this interesting angle they're going with it where they don't want to work for

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
advertisers.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.720
They want to work for you.

27:19.720 --> 27:20.760
I can respect that.

27:20.760 --> 27:24.080
It's a different way of thinking.

27:24.080 --> 27:31.760
But this is the same group that's brought us penny arcade expo.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.840
They brought us the child's play charity, which are two great things.

27:36.840 --> 27:39.680
I can't say anything bad about either of those things.

27:39.680 --> 27:44.780
Penny arcade expo gave E3 a ran for its money and still is in some regards.

27:44.780 --> 27:47.280
That's huge.

27:47.280 --> 27:50.040
Child's play, obviously a hugely important, great thing.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.320
It's a necessary thing in the gaming industry.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.320
They brought us that.

27:53.320 --> 27:55.080
So these are two great things.

27:55.080 --> 27:59.400
But then I kind of go, well, penny arcade with all this stuff that they built isn't

27:59.400 --> 28:03.080
exactly an indie darling anymore.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.760
You know what I mean?

28:06.760 --> 28:11.120
And they're asking for money to get rid of ads and one of the things that they're asking

28:11.120 --> 28:17.880
for is if you pay us $5,000, you get a play date with penny arcade.

28:17.880 --> 28:21.200
In other words, you fly to us for an evening of pizza and games.

28:21.200 --> 28:30.320
I'm just kind of like, I get the Kickstarter is not really supposed to be about the rewards,

28:30.320 --> 28:35.560
but if you're investing in a website, if you're basically giving them money, what are you

28:35.560 --> 28:38.680
really getting in return?

28:38.680 --> 28:41.640
And apparently they don't understand Kickstarter is about the rewards.

28:41.640 --> 28:47.000
That's kind of why people, people like the preorder bonuses for things.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.480
And so that's why they, you know, it's kind of the incentive to get you the back money

28:52.480 --> 28:53.800
for these things.

28:53.800 --> 28:59.280
And some of them, it's like I remember on the penny arcade one, which someone mentioned

28:59.280 --> 29:03.920
kind of border lining on, you know, breaking the terms of surface of Twitter.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.120
They said, we will follow you on Twitter.

29:06.120 --> 29:11.000
If you pay us this much, we will retweet something that you said.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.760
If you pay this much, we're literally, they're going to find your tweet and click a button

29:16.760 --> 29:20.600
for like a couple hundred bucks.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.520
Ooh, that sounds difficult.

29:25.520 --> 29:30.080
And honestly, if they're retweeting something that you said, who gives a shit what you said?

29:30.080 --> 29:33.360
I mean, you're gonna say, oh, retweet it from them.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
Who's this person?

29:34.360 --> 29:35.360
I don't know.

29:35.360 --> 29:39.480
They're not gonna, someone following penny arcade isn't going to go, oh my God, they

29:39.480 --> 29:40.480
retweeted this person.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.080
I need to follow them, become best friends with them.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.520
No one gives a shit.

29:44.520 --> 29:49.480
RDG cinch in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm under the impression

29:49.480 --> 29:51.240
that penny arcade was already profitable.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.240
I'm sure it is.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.200
But what they want to do, they want to take out the ads and have the people pay for it

29:56.200 --> 29:58.700
because they want to be a business that's run by the people.

29:58.700 --> 30:01.700
And I get that on paper, that sounds like a great idea.

30:01.700 --> 30:06.320
And maybe the answer for why would you give $5,000 is, well, it's about supporting the

30:06.320 --> 30:12.680
community and it's about supporting this, not just comic strip, but organization that

30:12.680 --> 30:14.680
I really like.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.340
But I'm like, well, can't you support them through ads too?

30:18.340 --> 30:22.400
If you support the website, click on the ads, check out the sponsors.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.400
That's another way to do it.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.400
That'll make a money too.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.800
Or advertise on their site.

30:25.800 --> 30:30.800
But penny arcade wants to, that's a conscious decision on their part.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.080
They want to not have that be the way people support them anymore.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.400
They want to cut out the middleman.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.320
It's interesting.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.320
I don't know.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.440
I don't know what to think about it.

30:41.440 --> 30:46.560
I'm not exactly going to donate, but I think it's interesting.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.560
I will continue to donate to Child's Play.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.560
I will continue to support the Child's Play events.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.640
I will continue to attend Penny Arcade Expo when I can.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.640
I'll continue to read the website and click on an ad when it looks interesting.

30:57.640 --> 31:04.400
But Kickstarter, not my thing, but that's just me.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.400
City Vampire says, why donate money to remove ads?

31:07.400 --> 31:10.520
Something gaming related would be much more preferable.

31:10.520 --> 31:15.960
If they'd done this, because wasn't that Penny Arcade volume three in trouble for a long

31:15.960 --> 31:19.520
time and it looked like it took them a long time to find a person that would actually

31:19.520 --> 31:21.920
make it because the first two didn't do so hot or something like that.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.320
I don't want to make stuff up, but I know the third game took a long time and it came

31:25.320 --> 31:27.440
from somebody else and it has kind of a different look to it.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.920
And is way better.

31:28.920 --> 31:34.640
Why didn't they just fund a potential Penny Arcade 4 or whatever or Penny Arcade other

31:34.640 --> 31:36.840
thing through this?

31:36.840 --> 31:37.840
It's interesting.

31:37.840 --> 31:42.400
Or better yet, they have a card game coming out that's based on one of their comics as

31:42.400 --> 31:47.160
well in Kickstarter, but it's some other company putting it out that licensed it from Penny

31:47.160 --> 31:48.160
Arcade.

31:48.160 --> 31:52.560
I'm not sure Penny Arcade's making, I'm sure they're making some money off of it.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.360
I don't know.

31:54.360 --> 31:58.240
I think a lot of the stuff that they do, I mean, they sell merchandise.

31:58.240 --> 32:04.800
They sell stuff to help fund their organization and I know now that they're a lot bigger than

32:04.800 --> 32:05.800
they used to be.

32:05.800 --> 32:11.920
They have their own offices, obviously they can run these conventions, which I'm sure

32:11.920 --> 32:15.440
are pretty expensive, but I'm sure they're making money off of them as well.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.480
Otherwise they...

32:17.480 --> 32:21.980
I mean, I'm not going to say that they're not going to run them because they're not

32:21.980 --> 32:24.560
profitable, but they're not going to keep...

32:24.560 --> 32:28.040
They wouldn't be expanding if they weren't profitable.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.180
You know what else is weird about this whole Kickstarter is that they have these stretch

32:31.180 --> 32:36.000
goals that are at 1.1 million and 1.3 million and 1.4 million and they're locked.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
They're a mystery.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
It's a secret to everyone.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.600
You don't get to know what they are until they hit those goals and I'm kind of like,

32:40.600 --> 32:46.640
in what investment world do you get to keep these kinds of secrets?

32:46.640 --> 32:52.840
Like if this was a, you know, non-Kickstarter investment in the real world type of thing,

32:52.840 --> 32:56.880
I think there's like laws and stuff that prevent these kinds of secrets.

32:56.880 --> 32:59.720
You have to disclose these things.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.720
It's weird to me.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.240
It's a different way of thinking.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.240
I don't know.

33:04.240 --> 33:05.240
Anyhow.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.240
All right.

33:06.240 --> 33:07.840
I'm done talking about Kickstarters and all that.

33:07.840 --> 33:12.920
It was a big intro to the show, but it's really a huge part of what's going on in the gaming

33:12.920 --> 33:14.240
world this week.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.240
So it keeps going.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.400
We missed the Mac versus PC debate in the chat room.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.400
Really?

33:19.400 --> 33:20.400
Still?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.400
Yeah.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.400
Well, no.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.400
It's over.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.400
It's just, you know what?

33:24.400 --> 33:30.120
The biggest people who don't, who are all anti-Apple are not graphic designers.

33:30.120 --> 33:34.000
Thank you Game Guru for filling in the gap that made me look ignorant there.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.960
Penny Arcade 3 is being made by the Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World people.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.400
Not exactly a big budget, but actually a good fit.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.400
Thank you.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
I could actually totally see that.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.720
It's very much like the old school Final Fantasy games.

33:46.720 --> 33:47.720
That's awesome.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.160
It's actually already out on Xbox Live indie games, so go check it out.

33:50.160 --> 33:54.200
I mean, it's, I kind of wanted to check it out because I like those type of games.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.240
Not because I'm necessarily a Penny Arcade fan.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.800
I mean, I don't like their comics, but I don't read them every week.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.800
Right.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.800
All right.

34:01.800 --> 34:05.680
Well, anyhow, let's get on into how we're supposed to start the show off here.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.160
You know, 30 minutes into it.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.500
How was your gaming week?

34:08.500 --> 34:10.480
What types of video games you've been playing this week?

34:10.480 --> 34:13.960
And then we'll get into some housekeeping and then the rest of the gaming news we have

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
tonight.

34:14.960 --> 34:15.960
Let's start off though.

34:15.960 --> 34:16.960
First, what have you been playing this week?

34:16.960 --> 34:17.960
Dark Sakura.

34:17.960 --> 34:18.960
Mass Effect.

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
Still?

34:19.960 --> 34:23.200
Even though you, oh wait, no, you weren't here to tell us about how you...

34:23.200 --> 34:24.920
I beat it on Tuesday.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.240
Then I played WoW for like an hour.

34:27.240 --> 34:32.640
Then I went back and started modding my save file and figured out how to use the, because

34:32.640 --> 34:39.000
the big thing for 3 is that they, they had a default feme shot with all the special textures

34:39.000 --> 34:41.960
and everything like the dude one had, which is about damn time, except her face looked

34:41.960 --> 34:43.300
like a brick.

34:43.300 --> 34:48.400
But the textures were really good, except she also looked over at me like a cheap hooker.

34:48.400 --> 34:53.260
But I did figure out how to make my own face shape and everything so that she's, you know,

34:53.260 --> 34:58.760
basically doesn't have a head the shape of a brick and applied the textures to it.

34:58.760 --> 35:02.000
And then custom hairs that other characters in the game have.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.360
I also found out how to make Ashley's hair work on her, but her hair is like a shoulder

35:06.360 --> 35:07.960
item for armor.

35:07.960 --> 35:12.840
I also found the, and I've got to do a few tweaks to get it to work, I found how to use

35:12.840 --> 35:19.280
the hooker outfit, like the dancer outfits from Afterlife.

35:19.280 --> 35:22.760
So it's actually one of the underwears.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.200
So when you said you beat Mass Effect, you're talking about Mass Effect 3?

35:25.200 --> 35:26.200
Yes.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.520
Well I beat Mass Effect 2 the week before.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.240
Like me, you've now played the whole series this year, beaten all three games, da da da

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
da da.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.240
In a month.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.240
And now you're into modding them.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.240
Yes.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.240
Kind of your thing.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.560
Because I'm going to keep, I'm going to play it as a paragon.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.620
I don't really give a shit about playing Bit Shepherd.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.560
And I don't give a shit about playing as a dude either.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.120
I'm going to keep playing, I've done a few renegade options just in the curiosity.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.920
You are in the fem-shep-is-the-only-shep camp.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.920
Yeah, I guess.

35:50.920 --> 35:56.760
And you know, because I have this headcanon, the term I've kept using over and over, I

35:56.760 --> 35:59.560
have a headcanon and I'm sticking to it.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.580
So without spoiling, that ending.

36:02.580 --> 36:07.140
Now you are in a unique situation where, you know, we're starting to hear people now that

36:07.140 --> 36:08.720
are getting into the series.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.120
You never saw the original ending.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.380
You only saw extended cut.

36:11.380 --> 36:12.840
I saw part of the original ending.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.800
And I did go back and watch it.

36:14.800 --> 36:19.260
But yeah, my official first ending was extended cut.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.560
And I wasn't disappointed.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.000
It was just fine.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.360
I think it cleared a lot of stuff up.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.200
I think it had a definite resolution.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.660
And I'm happy with it.

36:28.660 --> 36:32.040
You know, I went back and watched some of the other ones online.

36:32.040 --> 36:34.800
You know, the one I picked was the Destroy ending.

36:34.800 --> 36:38.080
Except when I accidentally shot the stupid kid in the head.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.920
But then my game froze and I got to start over from the decision.

36:41.920 --> 36:45.200
The other thing I found out, by the way, with the save file editor, is that you can save

36:45.200 --> 36:48.320
your autosave files as standard save files.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.200
So where it loads as your autosave.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.980
Like say that you were at that last decision and you wanted to just to keep going back

36:53.980 --> 36:57.000
to that point, even though it's not like a standard save.

36:57.000 --> 37:03.980
You can close the game at that point, pull up the gibbed editor, and load your autosave

37:03.980 --> 37:05.840
and save it as a separate save file.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.400
So you can always go back to that point in the game.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.400
Pretty cool, huh?

37:09.400 --> 37:10.400
Yeah, that's interesting.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.840
Of course, when I did it, it was on 360 where you don't get to do any of that.

37:13.840 --> 37:17.320
Also, gibbed editor works for 360.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.920
You can import your files from your 360 if you're saving on the hard drive.

37:20.920 --> 37:26.200
Run them through gibbed editor because it's high, it's PC stuff.

37:26.200 --> 37:29.920
And even do custom hairs, custom textures, all that same type of stuff.

37:29.920 --> 37:34.020
You can, well you can't load the outside mods, but you can do all the stuff that's hidden

37:34.020 --> 37:35.020
in the game.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.680
You haven't even changed your coalesce bin.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.940
You can hack it, pretty much.

37:39.940 --> 37:41.520
So what now, now that Mass Effect's done?

37:41.520 --> 37:43.200
I mean, I know you want to do some...

37:43.200 --> 37:44.920
Playing through Mass Effect 3 again.

37:44.920 --> 37:50.120
You want to do some fan things, but are there any other series that you've overlooked that

37:50.120 --> 37:52.480
now you're thinking, hmm, maybe I should go back and revisit them?

37:52.480 --> 37:53.480
Not really.

37:53.480 --> 37:57.200
I mean, well, and keep in mind, I actually have beaten four games this year, because

37:57.200 --> 38:00.880
I beat Portal 2 again a couple of times.

38:00.880 --> 38:03.320
And still playing through Fractal.

38:03.320 --> 38:07.640
And then I've decided that I'm interested in WoW a bit again because of the goat mount.

38:07.640 --> 38:13.440
I want a riding goat and they better have rectangular pupils because goats are the best.

38:13.440 --> 38:19.400
I was on Girls Gone WoW today for their recording and we went long.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.880
It was, it was a good show.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
Awesome.

38:22.880 --> 38:23.880
GirlsGoneWow.net.

38:23.880 --> 38:24.880
You can hear that Wednesdays.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.880
Says hi.

38:25.880 --> 38:26.880
Hello.

38:26.880 --> 38:27.880
Hello.

38:27.880 --> 38:33.640
We went over a lot of the, what we think of the new mounts and I think we had a general

38:33.640 --> 38:35.320
consensus that some of us like it.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.320
Some of us don't.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.320
How's that for consensus?

38:38.320 --> 38:39.440
Of course.

38:39.440 --> 38:40.680
Everyone's entitled to like or not like.

38:40.680 --> 38:43.360
I'm sure you guys had to talk about the pet battling a little bit.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.360
Pokemon.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.360
Yeah.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.360
Straight up Pokemon.

38:46.360 --> 38:47.920
But you have to name each of your pets and how is that going to work?

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
You don't have to.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.920
Well, I'm gonna.

38:49.920 --> 38:53.240
I'm going to name them all after Supernatural.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.240
Just Google cute pet names.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.440
I'll have Sam as a pet.

38:56.440 --> 39:02.400
You know, um, but I really, I mean really, except for my hour of wow, hour of wower,

39:02.400 --> 39:05.760
I've been playing Mass Effect and I'm going to keep playing Mass Effect.

39:05.760 --> 39:11.960
It's super fun and I still have a hundred percent galactic readiness on my damn phone

39:11.960 --> 39:19.220
and my next goal is to figure out how to get Ashley's face texture to work over the shepherd

39:19.220 --> 39:24.880
that I have without doing this really weird thing where it scrolls your camera out and

39:24.880 --> 39:27.160
clips through everything else.

39:27.160 --> 39:32.320
Like it did however show me exactly how some of the levels were laid out as far as their

39:32.320 --> 39:33.320
rendered space.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.320
So that was kind of neat.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.840
And at some point you do really have to check out the multiplayer with friends.

39:36.840 --> 39:37.840
I probably will.

39:37.840 --> 39:42.360
I just have to make sure that my coalesced bin is fine, but the only thing that I did

39:42.360 --> 39:47.600
on that really was set some key binds for weapons, which I'm probably going to undo

39:47.600 --> 39:52.660
and I play, I have my game hacked for god mode if I wanted it.

39:52.660 --> 39:57.360
So I don't really need any of that except for the one where you use no fuel.

39:57.360 --> 40:02.000
I have the things set where your fuel is a hundred, I mean not at a hundred, but you

40:02.000 --> 40:08.480
use zero and the Reapers don't find you as easily, that type of thing.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.520
All right, let's move on.

40:10.520 --> 40:11.680
Loki, how was your gaming week?

40:11.680 --> 40:13.040
I didn't play a lot.

40:13.040 --> 40:17.080
It's basically just Minecraft this week again.

40:17.080 --> 40:20.260
I like the new update.

40:20.260 --> 40:29.320
It's very fun and so I haven't gotten to make any pistons yet, but you know, I'll get there.

40:29.320 --> 40:36.040
I did, was it, I also like the new lighting engines, a little interesting, I guess it's

40:36.040 --> 40:38.280
supposed to be more like PC.

40:38.280 --> 40:42.840
And finally did start a new world as well with my coworker because we kind of got tired

40:42.840 --> 40:51.200
of playing just in mine and so we did start a new one and playing that on regular again

40:51.200 --> 40:55.400
with monsters and everything because I've been playing on Peaceful for a long time.

40:55.400 --> 41:04.000
I finally finished my mine cart track thing which goes across the entire map now and it

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
makes a full circuit.

41:05.000 --> 41:14.040
In fact, last night I was working on creating the redstone circuits for each stop.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.680
It's gonna have like a delay on it so the cart gets to the stop.

41:17.680 --> 41:22.640
There's about a 10 second delay where the cart stays there and then the cart automatically

41:22.640 --> 41:29.340
moves to the next stop so it's kind of a, you know, little bit of a, you know, subway

41:29.340 --> 41:38.280
type thing and it's gonna make a little ding-dong when it gets to the stop so it's kind of cool.

41:38.280 --> 41:43.160
And then Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, I've been playing that a little bit, changing up

41:43.160 --> 41:48.560
my custom classes to get ready for the tournament that I'll be playing in a couple weeks here

41:48.560 --> 41:49.560
which I'm very psyched about.

41:49.560 --> 41:50.760
And you did find a partner for that.

41:50.760 --> 41:58.160
I did find a partner, one of my friends, his brother plays a ton of Call of Duty so he's

41:58.160 --> 42:04.960
gonna be going down with me to the the armpit of California, Stockton.

42:04.960 --> 42:08.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Bakersfield.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.960
You're not going to Bakersfield.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.960
Sorry.

42:10.960 --> 42:14.800
What would Stockton be then?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.620
Stockton is kind of like...

42:16.620 --> 42:17.880
It's that part behind the knee.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.440
It's the mole on your butt.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.680
Not everybody has moles, Rob.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.080
Okay, how about...

42:24.080 --> 42:25.320
California has one and it's called Stockton.

42:25.320 --> 42:29.360
How about the belly button, because the belly button gets kind of stinky.

42:29.360 --> 42:33.000
It's the bankrupt part of the body, actually, is what it is.

42:33.000 --> 42:37.360
So we're going with Stockton in a couple weeks.

42:37.360 --> 42:41.460
But yeah, he's totally psyched to go and play and apparently he's really good with the pistols,

42:41.460 --> 42:43.460
so that's awesome.

42:43.460 --> 42:46.680
Still trying to figure out what sidearm I'm supposed to use because honestly I play a

42:46.680 --> 42:51.400
lot with just launchers and explosives because I have my primary weapon that I use for everything

42:51.400 --> 42:56.480
and launchers just take out helicopters and you know, maybe I call it my sniper rifle

42:56.480 --> 42:58.680
sometimes because that's why I shoot across the map.

42:58.680 --> 43:02.160
Sometimes I hit snipers.

43:02.160 --> 43:08.080
So I've never really bothered with a machine pistol or a pistol because I'm like, when

43:08.080 --> 43:09.740
the hell am I going to need this?

43:09.740 --> 43:11.200
I'm just going to use my regular gun for everything.

43:11.200 --> 43:16.320
If I run out of ammo with my regular gun, I'm going to pick up someone else's gun.

43:16.320 --> 43:17.320
I don't know.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.320
So I still have to figure out what I'm going to do there.

43:18.320 --> 43:22.040
I'm going to talk to him because he knows what he's doing.

43:22.040 --> 43:28.060
So we got all the rules and everything and it's kind of dumb, some of the restrictions

43:28.060 --> 43:29.820
that they have in there.

43:29.820 --> 43:30.820
No cheating.

43:30.820 --> 43:31.860
No, it's not even cheating.

43:31.860 --> 43:41.420
It's like no explosives at all except no C4, no Claymores, no bouncing betties, no launchers,

43:41.420 --> 43:53.920
no grenade launcher attachments, there's no recon perk, no sit rep.

43:53.920 --> 44:00.720
They're going to leave kill cams on for some reason, which is weird.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.240
And then some of the maps that they picked are just really huge for two on two matches.

44:04.240 --> 44:10.920
I'm like, hey, you know you guys, why don't you guys download the free face off maps,

44:10.920 --> 44:16.000
which they made for two on two matches.

44:16.000 --> 44:21.420
Makes sense that you would play on those maps because they're the size for a good two on

44:21.420 --> 44:22.420
two tournament.

44:22.420 --> 44:24.880
No, we're going to use the really large maps instead.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.120
Yeah, that sounds fantastic.

44:27.120 --> 44:31.040
I'm glad someone's running this tournament well.

44:31.040 --> 44:36.360
But whatever, I will play by their rules, but it's just stupid that they picked these

44:36.360 --> 44:37.360
giant maps.

44:37.360 --> 44:42.600
This village is terrible for two on two, it's just, okay, I hope I find you because this

44:42.600 --> 44:44.800
map is fucking huge.

44:44.800 --> 44:49.120
But we'll see, I guess.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.680
Anything else for your gaming week?

44:50.680 --> 44:55.560
I played a little Grand Theft Auto, but just because I was working on my mod, because I

44:55.560 --> 44:59.780
was talking to someone that helped out with their map modding stuff and just talking to

44:59.780 --> 45:03.960
about Grand Theft Auto things, I'm like, I kind of want to work on Grand Theft Auto again.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.440
And then I made an outhouse and I got bored.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.240
So that was that.

45:09.240 --> 45:13.560
I do need to finish the map mods I've been working on for almost 18 months now.

45:13.560 --> 45:19.320
So I can at least finish them before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.320
That's it.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.640
All right.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
My gaming week.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.400
Actually, I didn't play really anything new, but I revisited old stuff.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.320
In fact, really old stuff.

45:28.320 --> 45:32.720
Because Alan the other day was like, hey, I'm going to hook up the PlayStation 2.

45:32.720 --> 45:36.600
And then he didn't actually do it right away, but it had me thinking about PlayStation 2

45:36.600 --> 45:37.600
games.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.600
I kind of wanted to go back and play.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.940
So then the other night I was like, Alan, weren't you going to hook up the PlayStation

45:40.940 --> 45:41.940
2?

45:41.940 --> 45:44.000
And so he finally found it and hooked it up.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.920
And I promptly started playing Final Fantasy 12.

45:46.920 --> 45:47.920
I don't know why.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.160
I just never really played enough of it before.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.560
And I was just like, I don't want to play that again.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.840
I think I can blame Theatrhythm for that.

45:53.840 --> 45:56.200
Remember how I was talking last week about how it's kind of a commercial for the Final

45:56.200 --> 45:58.080
Fantasy games and makes you want to play them again?

45:58.080 --> 46:02.200
I think I can thank Theatrhythm for making me go, you know, I didn't play enough of 12.

46:02.200 --> 46:03.740
I'm going to go back and play more of that.

46:03.740 --> 46:06.440
So I played a little more of that.

46:06.440 --> 46:10.720
The other thing I got is that, you know, as we'll get into more of the details on later

46:10.720 --> 46:14.680
in the show, but as I'm sure all you guys know about, there's a steam sale going on

46:14.680 --> 46:15.680
right now.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.200
Oh, yeah.

46:18.200 --> 46:19.800
As in, give me all your money right now.

46:19.800 --> 46:21.120
I'm pretty broke as it is.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.120
Yeah.

46:22.120 --> 46:27.360
It's just like, but I need these games that I probably, yeah, I can tell you right now

46:27.360 --> 46:32.520
I was looking, actually it's funny what you were talking earlier, I was looking through

46:32.520 --> 46:38.640
my steam collection to see, you know, what exactly I have and I can honestly say maybe

46:38.640 --> 46:43.960
out of all of these, the steam copies, I may have played Portal 2, but most of these games

46:43.960 --> 46:51.760
I have not played yet and I'm just like, but I need more, I need more.

46:51.760 --> 46:52.760
That's awesome.

46:52.760 --> 46:57.200
I would be tempted to get Borderlands, but first person shooters make me sick and Dan

46:57.200 --> 46:59.080
and we already have it on Xbox.

46:59.080 --> 47:00.080
Right.

47:00.080 --> 47:05.120
Well, the platform thing didn't stop me because when Skyrim got discounted to 29 bucks, I

47:05.120 --> 47:07.040
was like, I want it on PC.

47:07.040 --> 47:10.200
So the mods are really cool that I've been waiting to get it for the mod.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.200
That's what sold me on it.

47:11.200 --> 47:14.880
To be honest is that I've watched Alan mod the shit out of his game and I was like, you

47:14.880 --> 47:15.880
know what?

47:15.880 --> 47:16.880
I want it.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.440
So I bought it and I got to say, especially because now when you download it, you can

47:20.440 --> 47:23.880
get the higher resolution texture pack is like DLC right away.

47:23.880 --> 47:29.760
My PC, my PC, well, this laptop is so pretty.

47:29.760 --> 47:34.840
I need to upgrade my PC and it's really pissing me off because it's going to be expensive

47:34.840 --> 47:35.840
to do that.

47:35.840 --> 47:40.480
And I don't ever use my PC anymore, but that PC was meant for like games like grant.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.080
Well, it was meant for crisis.

47:42.080 --> 47:48.980
And now of course it's way outdated because it has old 8,800 G no Nvidia cards in it.

47:48.980 --> 47:53.040
But this laptop, I think if I ran Skyrim on it, I think it would literally melt.

47:53.040 --> 47:57.040
Like I was running grant the thought of the other day and got up to 86 degrees Celsius

47:57.040 --> 47:58.380
on the GPU.

47:58.380 --> 48:03.700
I can, I almost boil water with my hand above the, the actual keyword.

48:03.700 --> 48:07.600
Like it wasn't even touching the monitor and it was too hot for my hand to stay there.

48:07.600 --> 48:11.520
So and I have this thing modded for cooling too.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.200
So I don't know what I'm going to do.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.480
And I all of a sudden, now I'm on this new mission is I really want to get back into

48:16.480 --> 48:20.000
civilization five because I need to get the gods and Kings expansion when it gets discounted

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
again.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.760
And it was only $8 on steam the other night.

48:23.760 --> 48:26.680
So I'm convinced before the 23rd, it'll be on sale again.

48:26.680 --> 48:29.120
And I'm going to buy Alan a copy and make him play with me.

48:29.120 --> 48:36.360
But yeah, seriously, anybody that has Borderlands add me on steam because I don't have anybody

48:36.360 --> 48:37.400
added at all.

48:37.400 --> 48:42.460
We do have a vog network group on steam where you should, I can find, I'm thinking we need

48:42.460 --> 48:46.280
the work on getting some Borderlands games night going because I'm picking up Borderlands

48:46.280 --> 48:52.080
two when that comes out, probably not for PC, but on X-Box three 60 because Borderlands

48:52.080 --> 48:53.240
is just an awesome game.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.400
I do want to go back to it.

48:54.400 --> 49:00.800
I, I'll be playing on an X-Box again, but my, my coworker won't return my copy.

49:00.800 --> 49:03.880
So I'm just like, eh, fine.

49:03.880 --> 49:04.880
All right.

49:04.880 --> 49:08.320
Um, let's get into some announcements then we can get into the rest of the gaming news.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.320
Um, announcements.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.400
I have a few tonight.

49:10.400 --> 49:13.240
First off the voice of geeks network at vog network.com.

49:13.240 --> 49:19.240
I'd like to welcome critical myth and British in British invaders, almost a British invasion,

49:19.240 --> 49:22.200
which it is kind of an invasion, but it is the British invaders.

49:22.200 --> 49:25.140
We want to welcome both those shows to the lineup.

49:25.140 --> 49:26.840
Both those shows are going to be airing Monday.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.600
Critical myth is actually three times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

49:29.600 --> 49:33.840
So both those shows, uh, announced earlier tonight, joining the network, if you want

49:33.840 --> 49:37.420
the full announcement, Bobby will append it to his podcast this week.

49:37.420 --> 49:40.860
So that'll be posted in the next couple of days, but we want to welcome them to the network.

49:40.860 --> 49:43.320
They both start tomorrow.

49:43.320 --> 49:47.760
Um, also, um, feedback about the checking into the podcast.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.080
A lot of folks miss the check-in word last week.

49:51.080 --> 49:55.640
So Bobby and I kind of sat down and talked and we now have a little chime noise that

49:55.640 --> 49:58.560
you're going to hear before the word is given.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.280
So that way, those of you guys that are kind of zoning as you're working and you miss the

50:01.280 --> 50:05.200
check-in word, you have something to kind of snap out of it and Oh, pay attention.

50:05.200 --> 50:08.660
So, uh, just throwing that out there, you will now hear a little chime noise before

50:08.660 --> 50:09.660
the check-in word.

50:09.660 --> 50:10.960
All right.

50:10.960 --> 50:14.640
Did I hear Jamie's buying Borderlands over there?

50:14.640 --> 50:15.640
Yes.

50:15.640 --> 50:16.640
Good job.

50:16.640 --> 50:23.080
I want to see Gabe Newell is sitting in an evil layer somewhere going, yes, excellent.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.520
Someone needs to buy me Saints for the third.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.520
How about that?

50:27.520 --> 50:32.920
I want to say, um, I think, I can't remember if Borderlands had a third person view or

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
not in it.

50:33.920 --> 50:39.560
I want to say, did I saw maybe, I think there's a way to hack it on PC where

50:39.560 --> 50:43.360
you run third person, which if that, if you can then cause you can do it in portal two,

50:43.360 --> 50:44.520
you can play portal two third person.

50:44.520 --> 50:45.520
Yeah.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.520
All right.

50:46.520 --> 50:49.720
The one other announcement I have is that we will be participating in PlayStation home

50:49.720 --> 50:53.040
summer Fest to the VOG network is participating in that.

50:53.040 --> 50:54.680
Be ready on the 29th.

50:54.680 --> 50:55.960
That's in two weeks.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.800
We are going to be broadcasting in PlayStation home.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.560
Now I want to make this clear though.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.920
Nothing is like changing.

51:02.920 --> 51:06.360
You still go to VOG network and you can, you know, hear our show and everything and the

51:06.360 --> 51:07.480
podcast is still there.

51:07.480 --> 51:09.280
Like always that part's not changing.

51:09.280 --> 51:13.360
But as we've done on a few nights, we're going to have home open as well.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.000
We'll be in PlayStation home fielding questions and so forth.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.840
This isn't just the clubhouse though.

51:17.840 --> 51:21.820
This is actually, we're going to be out in one of the spaces called Aurora 1.5, which

51:21.820 --> 51:28.680
is kind of a trippy little like, uh, like flashy colors, tunnels that whisk you to places

51:28.680 --> 51:30.840
and things, mini games, lots of unlocks.

51:30.840 --> 51:31.840
It's a fun little world.

51:31.840 --> 51:35.240
I was in there earlier, so we're going to be in the Aurora space starting at five Pacific

51:35.240 --> 51:41.120
when Bobby's on, uh, a Eastern on the 29th, where the last event for PlayStation summer

51:41.120 --> 51:45.480
Fest, where they're really excited to have us, we're really excited to be a part of it.

51:45.480 --> 51:49.940
I do want to point out, it's not an official Sony home acknowledged thing, but we're hoping

51:49.940 --> 51:52.000
to make enough rabble that they'll notice.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.840
So we're going to flip some chairs over in Aurora.

51:53.840 --> 51:55.120
It'll be fun.

51:55.120 --> 51:57.560
It's just, listen, listen, running man.

51:57.560 --> 52:00.440
Listen, if you're going to flip chairs over, nobody's going to notice.

52:00.440 --> 52:02.840
It's all about tables, tables, tables, tables.

52:02.840 --> 52:05.520
Sorry, it's all about flipping tables now.

52:05.520 --> 52:11.120
So plan on joining us on the 29th steam needs to be on Linux.

52:11.120 --> 52:14.680
I thought they did have some type of Linux support or something.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.000
If they do, I haven't found it.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
I could be wrong.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
All right.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
We got to get into gaming news.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.800
We're like, we're talking a lot tonight.

52:20.800 --> 52:21.800
Sorry.

52:21.800 --> 52:22.800
Let's get into gaming news.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.800
Loki.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
Okay.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.400
So Amazon has a brand new service that they've announced.

52:26.400 --> 52:34.160
It's basically a free-to-play game service called Game Connect, and it's not necessarily

52:34.160 --> 52:38.960
the same service that they announced for Kindle, which was Game Circle, but Game Connect, they're

52:38.960 --> 52:43.680
going to have basically a way to discover new free-to-play games and MMOs and that kind

52:43.680 --> 52:44.920
of stuff.

52:44.920 --> 52:48.800
And you can check it out over at Amazon.

52:48.800 --> 52:49.800
Let's see here.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.880
I'm sure they've got a link on the front page to do that stuff.

52:51.880 --> 52:54.600
Let's see what kind of games they've got here.

52:54.600 --> 52:59.000
World of Tanks, I mean, you can't hate a world full of tanks.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.880
Shimagami Tensei, that's pretty cool.

53:04.880 --> 53:08.200
A lot of interesting-looking MMOs.

53:08.200 --> 53:12.360
8-bit MMO, kind of looks a little bit like Minecraft.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.960
You can build anything they say in there.

53:15.960 --> 53:20.720
RuneScape, let's see here.

53:20.720 --> 53:23.560
A bunch of games.

53:23.560 --> 53:26.520
So definitely go check it out.

53:26.520 --> 53:31.540
And I wonder if they're going to have some more stuff included with that.

53:31.540 --> 53:37.120
They're saying that some of the launch titles, Battlestar Galactica, World of Tanks, Pandora's

53:37.120 --> 53:42.840
Saga, Stronghold Kingdoms, and Super Monday Night Combat.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.840
So why does Amazon want to jump into this?

53:45.840 --> 53:49.840
I guess Amazon likes to kind of get their hands on everything.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.840
Exactly.

53:50.840 --> 54:01.040
They want to maybe get in on some of that in-game content.

54:01.040 --> 54:05.980
Maybe they'll tie it in with the Kindle or something like that.

54:05.980 --> 54:11.380
Maybe they can find a way to get some of these games to run on that platform.

54:11.380 --> 54:15.600
I don't know, I think just to get more hits on their site for whatever reason.

54:15.600 --> 54:19.960
So people think of Amazon as the place to go for everything.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.760
I guess it seems like a good tactic.

54:21.760 --> 54:27.000
But do you think people will care?

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
I don't know.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.300
I don't know if they are necessarily going to care.

54:30.300 --> 54:36.320
It's kind of like, I don't think these places are the only places you can go to play these

54:36.320 --> 54:37.320
games.

54:37.320 --> 54:40.280
So if you're playing them already, it's not like you're going to go, okay, I'm going to

54:40.280 --> 54:44.720
all of a sudden go to Amazon.

54:44.720 --> 54:48.920
It's definitely a way for maybe some of these companies that are putting out free-to-play

54:48.920 --> 54:54.000
stuff because the free-to-play market is quite crowded to get some exposure maybe.

54:54.000 --> 54:59.060
So it's like, hey, I saw your game on Amazon, I'm going to check it out.

54:59.060 --> 55:02.020
Amazon hasn't been popular with every part of the gaming community though.

55:02.020 --> 55:06.400
Some say that Amazon kind of rips them off because the whole like, you know, they have

55:06.400 --> 55:11.480
the right to price match whatever you do other places and kind of all this stuff.

55:11.480 --> 55:15.920
And some developers had their game put up for free for too long on there.

55:15.920 --> 55:19.240
You know, I just remember hearing stories in the past about how not everybody's thrilled

55:19.240 --> 55:21.480
with Amazon.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.740
You kind of need them.

55:23.740 --> 55:29.920
The developers that is to, well, we'll see what comes of that.

55:29.920 --> 55:32.120
Although no Amazon console yet, right?

55:32.120 --> 55:33.120
That's the last thing we need right now.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.120
It's just a console.

55:34.120 --> 55:37.600
But if you want to check them out, it's amazon.com slash free.

55:37.600 --> 55:40.920
The number two play.

55:40.920 --> 55:45.840
Did I just see in chat that DJ Morpheus from understation live also just bought borderlands.

55:45.840 --> 55:53.200
That is 750 for the game of the urgent.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.200
That is well satiated.

55:55.200 --> 55:57.840
I'm just saying borderlands was a great game to begin with.

55:57.840 --> 56:03.640
And they, that was a game that they knew how to do DLC and their DLC was pretty awesome.

56:03.640 --> 56:05.400
So game of the year edition.

56:05.400 --> 56:08.720
And if you're too cheap for the game of the year edition, they have a regular version

56:08.720 --> 56:09.720
for five bucks.

56:09.720 --> 56:13.240
I just don't want to hunt around for skulls.

56:13.240 --> 56:14.240
It's all about loot.

56:14.240 --> 56:17.720
I mean, seriously, if you like playing the vog game and stuff and collecting loot, this

56:17.720 --> 56:20.320
game is just like shiny gun drops.

56:20.320 --> 56:21.840
Ooh, this is different than the one I had.

56:21.840 --> 56:22.840
It's like all these guns.

56:22.840 --> 56:24.080
I can't carry them all.

56:24.080 --> 56:29.000
I mean, it's just loot and the little robot and clap trap is awesome.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
All right.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.040
I watched Dan play through it on Xbox.

56:32.040 --> 56:35.240
Well, this series I'm about to get to get into is awesome.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.360
I remember this from the eighties.

56:36.360 --> 56:39.160
It was one of my favorite role playing series growing up.

56:39.160 --> 56:43.580
I even liked the NES sports, even though some people hate them, but I remember it as a kid.

56:43.580 --> 56:44.580
It's Ultima.

56:44.580 --> 56:45.800
Remember the Ultima series?

56:45.800 --> 56:46.800
It's Ultima Exodus.

56:46.800 --> 56:47.800
Yeah.

56:47.800 --> 56:48.800
There was Ultima online.

56:48.800 --> 56:51.600
It was like kind of the first MMO in some ways.

56:51.600 --> 56:57.640
You know, Ultima has a great history behind it and Ultima it's coming back y'all.

56:57.640 --> 57:01.120
Oh, but not in the way you might think.

57:01.120 --> 57:06.400
No, there's, there's no like Ultima 10 or, you know, any new Ultima underworld or something

57:06.400 --> 57:07.400
being announced.

57:07.400 --> 57:08.400
No.

57:08.400 --> 57:12.860
EA is going to be releasing Ultima forever.

57:12.860 --> 57:13.860
It's a cross-platform.

57:13.860 --> 57:17.080
It'll take 13 years to come out.

57:17.080 --> 57:21.840
I just want to point out Duke Nukem's last game was also named Duke Nukem forever.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.840
Hence my comment.

57:23.840 --> 57:29.020
Ultima forever is a cross-platform free to play role playing game.

57:29.020 --> 57:34.240
It's being developed by BioWare, which okay, we like BioWare, right?

57:34.240 --> 57:36.880
But it's free to play, which okay.

57:36.880 --> 57:41.520
It's going to be published under what they call the play for free label.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.960
What a descriptive label for EA.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.000
That's so weird that they would put it under that label.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.320
Battlefield Heroes is also that same division.

57:49.320 --> 57:50.320
Okay.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.320
Well, Battlefield Heroes is pretty good.

57:51.320 --> 57:53.720
So, oh, wait, no, I'm thinking 1942.

57:53.720 --> 57:57.000
It's kind of, you think of the shooter from Capcom from how many years ago?

57:57.000 --> 57:58.000
No, no, no.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
They had a Battlefield game.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.440
I don't remember if it was Battlefield Heroes or not.

58:01.440 --> 58:04.040
Whatever the one it was on, maybe that was Heroes.

58:04.040 --> 58:06.080
You will be controlling an avatar.

58:06.080 --> 58:08.440
There's a cartoon aesthetic to it.

58:08.440 --> 58:13.120
There's a character named Lady British now and I'm assuming that's because Lord British

58:13.120 --> 58:14.720
is no longer with EA.

58:14.720 --> 58:16.200
Lord British is Richard Garriott.

58:16.200 --> 58:19.840
He's off doing his own thing, trying to travel to space and all that and has the Facebook

58:19.840 --> 58:20.840
thing.

58:20.840 --> 58:25.520
So now there's Lady British, which you got to admit it's kind of a nice little work around

58:25.520 --> 58:28.160
for Lord British not being there anymore.

58:28.160 --> 58:34.760
So yeah, they are saying in the press release, the first great Western RPG has been lovingly

58:34.760 --> 58:37.040
restored in Ultima forever.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.360
You can sign up for the beta.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.360
Ultimaforever.com.

58:39.360 --> 58:44.640
I got to admit, I'm curious, BioWare makes a lot of good stuff.

58:44.640 --> 58:45.640
I'll play it.

58:45.640 --> 58:48.960
The free to play thing makes me a little nervous, but I do like Ultima.

58:48.960 --> 58:55.000
So it's kind of one of those, well, free is a great trial price, isn't it?

58:55.000 --> 59:00.200
It's better to pay nothing for a demo than to pay something for a demo.

59:00.200 --> 59:01.560
I'm signing up for the beta.

59:01.560 --> 59:03.840
I am so sorry, Bobby Blackwolf.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.440
Richard Garriott, he's correcting me in chat.

59:06.440 --> 59:08.280
He didn't try to travel to space.

59:08.280 --> 59:10.380
He did go to space.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.920
I am so effing sorry for that oversight.

59:12.920 --> 59:18.640
He went to space and he made some stupid paintings in space, which keep popping up in that stupid

59:18.640 --> 59:20.360
garage sale game he has.

59:20.360 --> 59:24.360
Gameguru at live.vognetwork.com says, if you want to play a free to play Ultima, go to

59:24.360 --> 59:29.680
Good Old Games, Ultima 4, and the two worlds of Ultima games are free over there.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.280
I didn't know Ultima 4 was still free.

59:31.280 --> 59:35.320
I thought that was just a weekend promotion, but yeah, there are some good Ultima goodness

59:35.320 --> 59:37.160
over at Good Old Games.

59:37.160 --> 59:41.000
When I was talking about Ultima Revival, Stan had brought up Ultima Dancing Game, cause

59:41.000 --> 59:42.440
you know, that's where everything's going these days.

59:42.440 --> 59:45.120
Acidic Vampire follows that up with Ultima Rhythm.

59:45.120 --> 59:48.840
No, I don't, I mean, Ulta Rhythm.

59:48.840 --> 59:52.880
There was some good music in the NES ports of Ultima, but I think for a long time there

59:52.880 --> 59:55.200
really wasn't music in the Ultima games.

59:55.200 --> 59:59.800
Then later on you would get like the AdLib soundtracks and so forth, but I forgot about

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.040
the AdLib.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.000
Yeah, I had one of those.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Fuck Sound Blaster.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.240
I had an AdLib.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.240
That thing was the shit.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:14.760
All right, anyhow, that's it, Ultima Forever, coming soon, Dark Sakura.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.760
I just signed up for the beta.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.760
Did you?

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.760
I just did, yeah.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.760
I kind of want to sign up too.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.760
We'll see.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.760
Is it a Facebook game?

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760
I don't see anything about that.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760
If it's a Facebook game, I'm out.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.780
Well, if it's on Facebook, then I'm sure as fuck not going to play it, but I mean, I won't

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.240
find out until they put out a release, you know?

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.240
Yeah.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.800
It's an Ultima free-to-play game, though, but this is, this is cartoony.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:47.720
Okay, whatever, okay, so how about a new model for PS3?

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720
Another one?

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:49.720
Wait a minute.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.640
Sony's only supposed to put out two models this cycle.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:01:03.120
The 4000 series is rumored to be out at Gamescom next month, and it is, there's a 4011C is

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.800
the one that we've got a picture of here, I mean, it still looks like a Foreman grill,

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.680
but at any rate, the pictures, sorry, the pictures and information were coming from

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:23.160
the British Agency of Telecommunications website, so I mean, it looks like it's ridged with

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.560
a sliding panel, but I mean, like I said, still looks like a Foreman grill, but it does

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:31.980
fall in with the FCC documents that Sony filed earlier in the month.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.600
This does have the new waffle attachment, though, so you can make waffles!

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.600
Waffles!

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.800
I wonder if I can cook chicken on it, and then we'll have waffles.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.560
Fact or crap, though, because this whole thing's still a rumor, right?

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.040
Well, we've got a picture of it, and they did file documents with the FCC.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.120
Well, the fact that there's a new system SKU coming that's, you know, this FCC filing true,

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.360
the fact that these pictures are of it or not, eh, maybe.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.680
I'm going to the Brazilian website real quick.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.840
It'd be better if it was a hoax, it'd be better if it was all wood grain.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.320
Yes, I want it in English.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.960
I do not speak Portuguese website.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.360
Anyhow, do we need another PlayStation design, though?

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.840
I think I put it in Esperanto.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.280
Well, there is, I mean, there's a lot of speculation on what it was, and based on these pictures,

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:26.760
which they're assuming are real, they said it looked like it had top-loading disk drive,

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.400
which that would be weird, but...

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.200
Going back to the PlayStation 1 with that, it's pretty cool.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.640
We know how well that worked.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.980
That'd be interesting, I gotta say.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:42.240
Can I prop the door open to load region-locked games?

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.320
I guess I don't have to worry about that on PS3.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320
Only one.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320
Only one, yeah.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.720
All right, moving on.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.200
So I know this is going to come as a shock, but there's another game being ripped off

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.700
on the iPhone App Store.

01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:56.960
This time it's Torchlight.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.920
Apparently there's a game called Armed Heroes Online.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.720
Yes, I know, sounds generic enough.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.760
It's on the Canadian iTunes store, and apparently they've ripped off nearly all the assets for

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.760
Torchlight.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:22.060
And the game code doesn't look like it's actually been ripped, but definitely all the assets

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:30.200
from the game, all the 3D models and stuff, have been ripped and put into this game.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.420
So that's kind of surprising.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.720
And the makers of Torchlight are understandably pissed.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.300
Yeah, they're definitely pissed off.

01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:38.300
Now here's the question.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.780
Obviously, and I think it mentions this in the story, it's coming from another country.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.760
It's not a US country, or excuse me, it's not a US or Canadian company even that's doing

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760
it.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760
It's a company out of Beijing, right?

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.480
Yeah, EGLS Technology.

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:52.320
They're based out of Beijing.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.720
And the game itself is free to play.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:59.640
Of course, they have in-app purchases, some upwards to almost $100.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.880
And it's just bad.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.160
The makers of Torchlight can't sue this company.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.880
And if it were me, I would be so mad.

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.140
I would want to sue.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:15.600
But you can't do that, really.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.080
That's not the way the world works, sadly.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.960
So now it comes back to, well, Apple should be able to recognize this stuff.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:27.660
But if I'm hearing it correctly, they didn't rip off the game, they ripped off all the

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.200
art assets.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.040
So to a person who looks at 100 apps a day, you know, to give the approval or denial,

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.460
maybe they didn't catch it.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.500
So now what do you do?

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.960
How do you stop this shit?

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.760
Well, they must have, they should have a way that you can flag it or something and say,

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:51.480
you know, flagging for, you know, obscenities or for, you know, copyright infringement or

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480
something like that.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.440
So this can be looked at by somebody.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.200
And granted, there's gonna be some false positives or whatever people are saying, oh, I'm just

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.000
gonna, I'm gonna say you ripped off Tetris or something.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.520
But you know, it would be a good way to, you know, have it police itself, I guess.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.400
I don't know.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.800
I have to say, that's actually kind of a good idea.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.360
You know, and people who just cry wolf too much would obviously be banned themselves

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.920
from being able to do that in the future.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:20.800
But yeah, I think they're gonna need to go to some type of community policing system,

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.800
unfortunately.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.200
I mean, Apple's, I think, been pretty good when this stuff is called to their attention.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.120
I mean, I've heard that they just, like this company, will probably never be able to put

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.920
another thing up on the iTunes store.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.920
But oh, well, they'll just apply under a new name.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.520
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be really hard to get one of those $100 developer licenses.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.520
So.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520
Yep.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.520
So.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.320
I'm sure that'll be difficult for them to acquire and change their name to, you know.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.360
I don't know.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.120
Not company that ripped off Torchlight Inc.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:56.820
Well, this is a game people are excited about and maybe it'll get ripped off and put out

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.260
here sooner than the actual game itself will come out here.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.480
Phantasy Star Online 2.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.120
It is officially, as of this week, coming to North America and Europe.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.840
It's happening early next year, early 2013.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.200
And it's pretty.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.960
Producer Satoshi Sakai says the wait will be worth it.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:20.640
Quote, the number one thing we want to provide to players in PSO2 is an adventure that changes

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.680
every time they log in.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:27.760
Just as a great tabletop RPG experience revolves around imaginative and unexpected encounters,

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.520
we want players to consistently be surprised as they explore dungeons and undertake quests.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.820
I don't, speaking of surprise, I don't know if you saw the article where apparently that

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.800
game was hacked and someone had moved the NPCs around.

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.360
And so they put them on top of buildings and stuff like that.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.360
Already?

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.360
Already.

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360
Good gosh.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.360
It was funny, though, because they showed, it's like, hey, those quest-giving people

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:53.400
are way up there.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.520
That's unfortunate.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.000
Wow.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.400
I guess some other things with this.

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.200
It's out in Japan right now and it's free to download and it's free to sign up for because

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200
I know Shane.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.080
He might call into the show later to talk about it and I've been begging him to do something

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:16.000
for VOG on it, but, uh, he's been playing it because I guess you can just sign up and

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
play it.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.200
And he's been begging me to play with him, but I'm like, no, cause I don't like the Japanese

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.320
text will frustrate me to no end that I don't understand everything.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.040
I have to know every little detail.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.800
It's not a good idea for me to play this game.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:33.560
So, but it totally play the crap out of it.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.920
I was going to say, if you know a little more Japanese and it doesn't bother you as much

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.280
as it does me that you don't understand it, um, go check it out.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.680
Apparently you can, it's out now in Japan.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:48.680
It's easy to get in there and play, uh, let's move on before we get to the release date

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.240
Stark Sakura.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.240
Well, um, here's another case of stupid parents.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:08:01.220
Um, there's a dad, uh, blaming Microsoft for his son spending money, which I don't see

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:06.760
how Microsoft stood there with, you know, strings on his hand or mind control device.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.760
The guy's name is Sam Guerra.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.000
Um, his son's name is Nick.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.460
Uh, they live in Wolverhampton in, uh, over in the UK.

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:25.680
And uh, he said that the son spent, uh, at that 1,150 pounds on Xbox live, which is a

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:33.200
good two grand here, roughly, um, basically spending about a hundred pounds a day on games

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.520
such as FIFA and call of duty.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.680
But he wasn't realizing he was spending real money.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.920
Why aren't you watching your fucking bank account?

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.800
Why do you have this credit card put in the system when you have a 12 year old playing

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.960
it who does, uh, apparently wasn't paying attention in school and did not understand

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.400
how money works.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:58.080
You know, especially since they do put the warnings up there, you know, they've got it

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.920
on there exactly how much different items cost in terms of points.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.640
Sometimes you can run up those charges behind your parents back.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.240
Like when I was 12 I was addicted to prodigy chat rooms.

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.040
No, no, no, no, no.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.200
I got in so much fucking trouble though, the month that bill came in home and I'm not even,

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.480
I'm not even getting it to them for, you know, saying that, Oh, I didn't know it was real

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:21.480
money.

01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.320
That's bullshit because yes, they're going to try to use the excuse because it's Microsoft

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320
points.

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.580
The problem is though, when you run out of Microsoft points, you have to refill it, which

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.640
means you have to go purchase Microsoft points.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.740
It says purchase Microsoft points.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.760
It shows you this is how much 1000 Microsoft points costs.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.840
This is how much 8,000 Microsoft points costs and it has real money attached to it.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:42.760
You're telling me that he didn't know that was real money.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:43.920
He knew that was real money.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.400
Yeah, no one's that dumb.

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400
I'm sorry.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:50.440
And if your child is that dumb, then clearly needs to be in special education or something.

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:56.360
And if he needs to not be playing the xbox on super, it's not Microsoft's fault.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.080
It's your stupid kid's fault.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.840
And it's your fault for not being a better parent for not being more responsible and

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.040
keeping an eye on what the hell your damn kids doing instead of using the xbox as a

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:07.640
babysitter and a story.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.200
All I gotta say is that kid looks like he has fear in his eyes and that father looks

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.000
like he is angry as hell.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.320
So I'm guessing that he was taken care of.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.240
Microsoft their response and I'm quoting, there are multiple opportunities where consumers

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.960
are asked to confirm their purchases.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.920
The price is clearly displayed on the screen.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:31.060
It should also be noted that xbox live accounts registered for children's use have online

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.480
activity automatically defaulted to off and that these can be enabled should a parent's

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.520
wish in the family settings section.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.120
These settings include specifying the email address to which all purchase notifications

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.380
are sent and using other features such as over the shoulder approval that allow the

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:52.360
account holder to give permission for purchases by typing in a password.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.520
So yeah, again, you're stupid.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.600
I love this comment in our chat room live.vognetwork.com.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:04.360
Game Guru says it's always FIFA and Ahamkara says FIFA again, why is that game always involved

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.280
when it comes to money theft?

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280
Hold on though.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.840
It's not really theft in this case.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:11.280
It's just their massive irresponsibility.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.480
They're just trying to pass the buck.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
That's all they're trying.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.480
Oh yeah.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.800
Um, the parent wants the money back and they're that desperate.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.800
Well, no.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800
What do you think?

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800
Oh, we just want an apology.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.360
No, you don't.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.840
You want your damn money and you're, you know, you're trying to say face is what you're trying

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840
to do.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840
Yeah.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.200
And sorry, it needs to burn a hole in your pocket so that you understand, you know, hit

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.480
you where you're hurt, where it hurts.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:35.480
Have some responsibility.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.640
I mean, let's, let's put it this way.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.480
I mean, this is a 12 year old that's grown up in pretty much like a digital age.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:42.920
He knows how it fucking works.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.880
He is not fucking oblivious to how purchasing stuff works.

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.760
Acidic vampire in our chat says you said the kid was 12.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.740
If he doesn't know what currency is, then you must live under our rock.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:57.240
Like that's the age where you're in junior high school and aren't you like buying lunches

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.240
sometimes?

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.320
They know what currency is.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
They come on.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.320
This is ridiculous.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.920
It's just because even Josh knows what currency is at this point probably.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:14.740
He knows he probably understood that he was spending money, but as I've mentioned before,

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:18.280
when the brain is developing, it's all about the immediate reward instead of the longterm

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.280
consequence.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.760
And this goes on in guys at least until between 25 and 27 on an average developmental range.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.800
And for women between 24 and 25, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.440
It's brain development.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440
Anyway.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:37.680
You mean all those trips I went on between 25 and 27 was just me lashing out?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680
Okay.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.120
And I will find, there's actually an article on it a few months ago in National Geographic,

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.680
but I read everything.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.920
But basically the brain is as big as it's going to be, but it's still forming neural

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.520
pathways until it reaches full maturity, which is in the late twenties.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.240
Which explains a lot of drama when you're young, you know, and bad relationships and

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240
lots of, you know.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.240
Oh my God.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.240
Dark soccer.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.760
I can't believe you would say that.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.920
Shut up.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:13.160
But it, you know, it does why, you know, there's the going out and drinking and then driving

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:16.280
and wrecking your car when you're not thinking about the consequence because your brain right

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.840
then is not programmed to think of the longterm consequences programmed to think of watch

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:25.040
out or someone's going to use that as an excuse in court officer.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.760
I was drinking and driving because my brain isn't fully developed yet.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760
You know what?

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:39.400
A dark soccer on orange lounge radio said, no, clearly there is different, but like,

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.480
but going back to a kid, the kid's going to have poor impulse control without having a

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:49.640
set reinforced expectation of punishment.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:54.800
If they do something bad, you know, it's like, or they might not even care, but the

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.280
point is, is that it doesn't mean he's stupid that he doesn't know better.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.160
It means he knew better and didn't care.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:06.760
So that, that's completely on the parent that you have to, if you don't want any of that

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.360
crap to happen, you have to, you know, cut off the means of making it happen.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.920
You have to not be an enabler, not necessarily disable the action, but not make it open to

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.760
where they can actively do it.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.720
That's part of your responsibility.

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.000
All right.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.840
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what money we can

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.360
spend on little purchases in the game in the next couple of weeks.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.760
Loki start here in the U S what's coming out here.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.720
Uh, I'm, there's really not anything coming up this week.

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:45.240
I want to say the only game coming out is heroes are ruined on three D S that's it kind

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.400
of a boring week, which actually is supposed to be a pretty good game.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400
It's coming from screen.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.680
So check it out.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.000
Tell Japan on the X-Box three 16, Assassin's Creed one and two welcome pack, I guess kind

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.520
of a catch up collection is coming out in Japan at a lower price on the PlayStation

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520
three.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:07.600
That same pack is coming out as well as some other games, including Sangoku Hime Senko

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.240
no Taika Akasuki no Hyu.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.360
That's in regular and luxury limited edition.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.480
I'm trying to figure out what this game is.

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.800
It's a strategy game and there aren't really any screenshots posted, but I see like dragons

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:21.800
and tigers.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.600
So I'm dragging.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.920
That's ancient mythology.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920
Yeah.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.800
So maybe it's like kind of a Nobunaga ish game.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:29.800
I don't know.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:34.440
Um, yeah, but then it didn't have much to do with actual with crouching tiger hidden

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.440
drag.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.440
No doubt it.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.000
Now what I find also interesting is that this is a peripheral coming out in Japan.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.160
It's like a 500 gigabyte drive for your PlayStation three, basically what it is.

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.820
It's like a, um, recorder kit and this is kind of weird.

01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:52.480
It's like this little thing that you can, I guess, record TV.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480
Yeah.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.400
They had like a DVR thing that was supposed to for the PSU back there.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400
Yeah.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400
So, I mean, they get that kind of stuff in Japan.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.860
Not here.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.360
You can buy stuff like that price.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.760
Um, yeah, but it's not official technically and it doesn't save your PlayStation drive

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.240
unless you use some creative workarounds.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:18.520
Uh, anyhow, also pointing out on the PlayStation Vita, uh, Jikyu Powerful Pro Yaku 2012 comes

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.120
out from Konami this week.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.120
Baseball.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.120
Yup.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:30.400
And lastly, let me check the 3DS here, uh, if it'll load for me, I love live radio.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.680
Rune Factory 4 comes out this week as well as Rayman Origins gets its Japanese release

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.680
on the 3DS.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:42.280
And something they call, this isn't a game, but some type of accessory candy bar for Nintendo

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280
3DS.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280
Candy bar is a doll maker.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.800
In black, blue, peach and white.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800
Yeah.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.800
Is that the doll maker?

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.800
Yeah, it is.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.800
Yeah, I guess.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.800
I guess.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.080
Is this some type of like accessory kit for stickers and stuff for the 3DS?

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.080
I guess.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.800
Let me, are there any other screen caps?

01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800
Nope.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:58.800
That's it.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.400
Well, I know that there's like a series of virtual doll makers that are called candy

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400
bar.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400
Hmm.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.400
So.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.400
Well, there you go.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:06.400
Japanese release dates.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.760
Two things in the UK.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:15.160
Tony Hulk's Pro Skater HD on the 18th and Boulder Dash XL 3D on the 20th for the 3DS.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.160
That's it.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.720
I wonder where everybody's at right now.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.720
I guess on vacation.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.240
Cause we don't have a lot of games coming out.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.320
The news was a little bit slow this week too.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.560
It's weird.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.360
Although there was a big story for you, Loki.

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360
I know.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.480
There was a few things actually.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.320
It wasn't mentioned on here, but they had another screenshot or trailer.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.800
I think it was a screenshot for the Earth Defense Force game.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:44.600
Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is the one that was 2017.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.600
Over here on 360.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.640
Remember it's coming out on the Vita.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:53.680
They showed a screenshot with the Jetpack Girl from number 2, which is awesome.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:56.240
Not to mention that that game also has 4 player co-op.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.960
Also awesome.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:01.000
But D3!

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I love them.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.400
They announced Earth Defense Forces 4.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.200
They have a teaser page on their website and it's a new game from Sandlot.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.880
I can't wait.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.800
And in fact it's Earth Defense Forces.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.920
I don't remember if the other games were Earth Defense Forces or if it's just Earth Defense

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920
Force.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.960
So I don't care.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.360
I'm gonna play that sucker.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.240
And if I have to import it, I'm gonna import it.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:30.440
Cause I love me some Earth Defense Force.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.080
Oh I'm sure it'll come out here too.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.120
Oh yeah it will, but not after a, you know, quite a delay, but oh I cannot wait.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.120
It's gonna be awesome.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120
I don't even care.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:48.040
I mean really cause it could be an absolutely terrible game cause 2017 was a terrible game.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.040
But it was fun.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.840
And that was the best part about it.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.560
So hopefully we'll see something before Tokyo Game Show.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.520
But if not, maybe at Tokyo Game Show.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:05.400
Alright well there was a rumor going around at Comic Con about a possible game made out

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.000
of Tron Uprising.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.520
There was a Tron Uprising panel at Comic Con apparently.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.520
I didn't even know about that.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:12.520
But apparently they were doing one.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.320
And I don't know if you've seen the anime yet, but it's pretty good.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.860
Well I keep calling it an anime cause it has that style to it, but I guess technically

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.860
it's not.

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.000
I mean if you want to get technical with me it's not, but whatever.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Cartoon.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I missed a bunch of episodes of that.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Whatever you want to call it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Tron Uprising.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Anime is short for animation.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Yep.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.120
So yes and it is an animation.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.400
So deal.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:38.160
But anyhow they had a panel at Comic Con and I guess they were told at the panel this would

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.000
look great on a Wii.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Wait a minute.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Dot dot dot.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.500
And a lot of folks took that away saying oh my gosh they're teasing a Tron Uprising game

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.500
on the Wii.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.680
Which had me thinking why?

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.680
The Wii is pretty much gone.

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:51.680
It'll be a Wii U.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680
It'll be a Wii U.

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:53.680
Yeah.

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:54.680
Right.

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:55.680
They're not putting anything on the Wii.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.240
And then it came out and N-Space actually came out and said we were actually referencing

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:04.000
the Tron Evolution Battle Grids game on the Wii.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.640
They are not working on a new Tron title at this time.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640
Boo.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.640
So the little tease.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.640
It's still early for the series.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:12.200
I mean given like a year.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.160
Especially if there's going to be a third movie.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.360
Especially you know because Disney's running out of things to make games on right now.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.320
I mean because they have you know Epic Mickey 2 and stuff, but next year they'll be like

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:25.920
uhhhh well let's see another Pixar movie maybe?

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.400
Well no I don't think there's another Pixar movie anytime soon.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.440
Brave just came out so you gotta wait till next year.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.440
I think the monster's a single.

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.680
Wreck-It Ralph, which I'm about to get into here.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.720
Wreck-It Ralph has been confirmed that he's going to be a playable character in Sonic

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.540
Racing Transformed.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.920
No word if it's exclusive to the Nintendo consoles because we know there's that whole

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:50.120
interesting Nintendo deal going on, but he will be a character for sure in the Nintendo

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.640
3DS version on November 16th.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.280
This is that same racing game that has like Danica Patrick and stuff, huh?

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.520
So you can be Wreck-It Ralph or Danica Patrick.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:03.560
Makes sense since they've got a cameo from Dr. Eggman in there or Botnik.

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:04.800
But that's kind of fun.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.480
So there you go.

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.880
Those are some Disney gaming news.

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:10.880
Dang it.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.880
What?

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880
You alright?

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:17.080
No the shirt that I wanted to buy is sold out only in XXL and that's way too big for

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080
me.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:19.080
What shirt were you trying to buy?

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:22.320
The ladies Normandy crew shirt.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.320
It was 11 bucks.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.440
I do want to get the bumper sticker for my car that says my other ride is a Normandy.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.200
I wouldn't mind the hoodie but it's 50 bucks.

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:36.080
Alright let's travel back in time to when gaming was simpler.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.880
And there wasn't 50 dollar tie-ins for video games.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880
Actually there totally was.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:44.760
I remember a catalog in Nintendo Power once that was selling Super Mario Brothers underwear.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:48.460
So they've been profiting off video games for forever.

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.720
I don't know if this is a game that they profited off of but I imagine they made a little bit

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.120
of money off of this game.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:57.120
Dark Soccer what is tonight's classic game of the week?

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.880
Classic game of the week is Shinobi for the arcade.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.200
Yep it is Shinobi.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.520
It's about damn time I actually did that.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.800
Instead of sequels like Shadow Dancer and Revenge of Shinobi and all that.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.880
So basically you are Jomosashi who has to rescue kidnapped students from a group of

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.880
terrorists.

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:23.120
After the arcade version it went out on the master system and then was converted to the

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:29.520
NES PC Engine and home computers and now you can play it emulated on the Wii and Xbox 360.

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.920
So yeah there were all kinds of stuff.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:37.680
You are trying to stop a criminal organization called Zeed.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.920
Then they are kidnapping the ninja children.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.080
Ooh so you have to go rescue them.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:45.880
Ooh and then beat all the bosses.

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:49.600
Can I just say this is my favorite most interesting thing in Shinobi and maybe you are going to

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:54.320
get to this in a minute but it's the whole Warhol Marilyn Monroe portrait that's randomly

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.880
in the background in one stage.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:57.480
And the mist colored Spiderman.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480
Yes.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.800
What is up with that?

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.960
So your stages you had five stages.

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.560
Your first one is pursue the terrorists where you have to kill Ken-O and then two is you

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:14.800
kill Black Turtle Attack Chopper and they drop a bunch of ninja on you.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:23.440
Then three is killing Mandara that sounds kind of like I guess a good tranny name.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:26.240
And then four is killing the lobster.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.240
Mandara.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.160
Shantae you stay.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.080
I'm not saying trannies are the same as drag queens because that's offensive and even that

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.120
term is offensive to some so I apologize.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:41.200
I'm just trying to be ignorant radio hosts.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:46.360
Anyway mission five is killing the masked ninja.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.660
So it's side scrolling.

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:49.740
You can throw your shuriken.

01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:54.200
You can hit them with your sword and you also have ninja magic.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200
Ooh.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:02.100
And your enemies can hide behind boxes or use blocks to shield your attacks.

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:06.840
So and then if you complete each stage without using your ninja magic or without using any

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.480
shuriken or bullets you earn points bonuses.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:14.760
And you have three minutes to finish each stage.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:20.320
So for the Master System it came out in Japan on June 19, 1988 and then came out in the

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.680
US after that.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.080
There were different bonus stages that were in the game.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.440
We had for home versions we had the Amiga.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:38.080
We had the Atari ST, Commodore 64, the Armstrong CPC and ZX Spectrum.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:44.640
And they were all developed by the sales curve and published by Virgin Mastertronic and in

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:48.600
Europe and by Sega in North America except for the Amstrad and Spectrum versions because

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.240
guess what we didn't have that.

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:58.040
The PC Engine version came out in Japan by Asmik on December 8, 1989.

01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:04.520
And then we had a NES version and like I said later on came out by on Wii and Xbox 360.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.440
And then in the Sonic Ultimate, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection it was included with that

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440
too.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.040
So yeah there's actually not anything on here.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:18.280
I'm gonna try to, hold on I'm gonna find this real quick, play some music Rob.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280
Oops.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:26.960
It's not really music so much as it is dude jumping up over.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.480
Okay the Spiderman was actually in Revenge of Shinobi.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:34.200
But there were guys that moved like Spiderman to Shinobi.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.800
There's totally like an inverse Spiderman looking guy right in the first stage.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.320
So and apparently Batman was in Revenge of Shinobi as well.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.320
So that's it Shinobi.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.920
There it is your classic game of the week Shinobi for the arcade by Sega.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:52.560
Do you know what Shinobi means?

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.680
No I think it means stealth but don't quote me.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:00.620
Alright we are gonna take a break here folks but we will be right back don't go anywhere

Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this July the 15th of 2012 with episode

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:32.880
number 465 of our show live as we are every Sunday at vog network dot com.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.800
We're about to get into some rapid fire news but I wanted to ask Jamie I noticed one thing

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.160
we haven't talked about on air yet is you know what we're eating behind the scenes.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.040
Loki is you know chowing down on his Carl's Jr. tonight but Dark Soccer and I were enjoying

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.040
beer.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.960
Yes cause beer is the food of the gods.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:55.440
I gotta say it's pretty awesome because today just on a whim Alan and I went out for lunch

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.440
brunch whatever at this place we've gone to for dinner sometimes a brewing company we

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.600
have here in SAC and we went there for lunch and what we learned today is that whenever

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:10.600
you eat there on a Sunday they give you free beer to go like the waitress came by was like

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:15.200
okay um now you get free 22 ounce beer for each entree you order so what beer did you

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:18.980
want to take home with you and we're like cool you get free beer and I'm like bring

01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:24.320
me the darkest thing you got because I only drink dark beer yeah so that what what's Alan

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:29.640
what's the name of the brand on the counter there it's a midnight what is it total total

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.240
eclipse black ale so Dark Soccer and I are enjoying a beer tonight and yes and it was

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:40.280
good and it was good so says Dark Soccer so we're chowing down on free beer I mean it's

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.880
not like it's food but it's not I mean pretzels with bread yes it's liquid bread all right

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:50.320
let's get into some rapid fire news some games you can play while you enjoy your beer and

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.800
I'm sure this first one would be a really hilarious game with a lot enough beer so you

01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:04.120
know Ubisoft purveyors of many dance games some great some good you may remember that

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.280
they did Michael Jackson the experience that's pretty cool then Black Eyed Peas experience

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:18.640
all right I'll follow you there now it's the hip-hop dance experience yes you can dance

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:27.080
like other hip-hop artists including they're gonna have rappers delight and they even mentioned

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:33.040
Flo Rida and I gotta admit I gotta say some of the video that they showed in there they

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:40.280
actually show somebody like doing a lot of floor work which good luck seeing that on

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:45.080
a connect I don't think that's gonna be able to work but neat if they show you like all

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:52.400
the breakdancing stuff and you know I don't know when you talk about like rappers delight

01:28:52.400 --> 01:29:07.200
being in the game I can't help but think about this I know that's quiet as hell and you can't

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.800
hear that but that's the rapping grandma from the wedding singer that was great here's the

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:18.720
thing I'm I'm torn in a couple things reasons one I mean I don't play a lot of dancing games

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:24.760
but back in high school I did take you know like a hip-hop dance class and it was fun

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:32.320
so might be something I'm interested in probably not something I'm gonna be picking up although

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:41.360
if I do get a free copy I'll be sure to try it out not on camera so that'd be neat black

01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:47.000
eyed peas I not on camera gee I wonder why black eyed peas the experience though is should

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.680
be pretty cheap by now so that might try picking that up they also of course this game is being

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:58.080
done by a niece and you know they're behind leap beat agents so a little bit of pedigree

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:04.080
there and of course near the game itself looks very similar to black eyed peas the experience

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:16.760
neat I guess all right so another cool bit of info Nintendo released that they have sold

01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:24.240
over 5 million 3ds systems in the US to date and that's almost almost been a year's time

01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:30.920
since they've dropped the price on 3ds so not bad not bad considering that they weren't

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:36.720
doing too well as of last year around this time and I'm sure that there is a big help

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:41.560
thanks to the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3d which sold over a million copies Super

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:48.800
Mario 3d Land which sold 2.1 million copies and Mario Kart 7 which sold 1.75 million copies

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:53.560
and of course they haven't really said anything about Kid Icarus Uprising something it's too

01:30:53.560 --> 01:31:02.240
bad but I don't think it sold that many copies and last but not least Capcom is bringing

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.680
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure to HD and coming to the Playstation Network and Xbox Live arcade

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:15.560
game the wonderful was it System 3 I can't remember it was on that weird arcade hardware

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:22.520
but yeah it's 2d fighting game based on the anime series manga series and you know getting

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:30.640
the typical Capcom HD Perez special filters treatment it's going to be available for 1600

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:37.240
Microsoft points or 1999 and it launches on August 21st on the Playstation Network and

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:46.160
22nd on Xbox Live arcade all right moving on a lot of people went squeak about this

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:53.000
this week Hello Kitty meets Sonic the Hedgehog yes there's this little doll that is Hello

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.280
Kitty meeting Sonic the Hedgehog and I know this doesn't make good radio but just as Sonic

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:01.960
the Hedgehog it's cute well you know it's kind of it does look like what would happen

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.360
if the two of them had a baby let's be real it's like it looks like the cosplay outfits

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.500
that they do for Hello Kitty regularly it's like an if they made it segment out of Conan

01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:17.200
O'Brien or something like that anyhow these are available the Sonic cross helo couse

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.040
at Hello Kitty Hello Kitty jumbo plushie is available or will be available at Sega amusement

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:27.880
parks in Japan starting in late July it is commemorating the reopening of Sega's Tokyo

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:35.320
Joyopolis on June 14th I guess the Hello Kitty Chun-Li plush will have to do for now that's

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:40.120
available at Comic-Con for 40 bucks I'm pretty sure it's already gone if you want that not

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:46.320
not a fan of Hello Kitty cross Chun-Li not a fan I don't like Chun-Li do you like Dark

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.160
Stalkers yes especially Morgan's boobs all right well then maybe this news will make

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:55.040
you a little more excited again this has to do a little bit with Comic-Con a comment was

01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:00.680
made by Yoshinori Ono that people are reading into here and it had to do with you know he's

01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:05.520
been telling fans tell Capcom what you want tell Capcom you want to do Dark Stalkers you

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:10.080
know this year apparently he said quote at Comic-Con he said quote this year you don't

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:15.240
have to do that and it's not necessarily bad news but he couldn't say much more than that

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:18.560
and of course a lot of people are reading into that that oh well if you don't need to

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:24.540
bug Capcom anymore it's because it's happening but I mean you know this has been speculated

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:30.240
for a while would make a lot of sense I'm sure it's a thing yeah the only bummer is

01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:33.400
it's going to come out the same year that new consoles start coming out and I bet this

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:38.680
is probably for the old consoles so I mean hopefully people don't miss this but it's

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:43.120
something that they could release spring fall I mean I don't even think it's necessarily

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.380
a bad thing that's coming out for new consoles and we don't even know if new consoles are

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:50.760
coming out this next year I mean it's speculated that's probably the earliest at the launch

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:57.940
but they could still hold off another year true very true additional characters for PlayStation

01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:03.240
All-Stars Battle Royale have been announced Cole McGrath Jack and Dexter all coming to

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:07.560
PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale that of course is the game that sure has a lot of

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:12.880
similarities to Super Smash Brothers but trust us it's a completely different game but it

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:17.360
has a lot of people very excited it'll be one of the bigger holiday releases from Sony

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:25.060
moving on Dark Sakura well for fans of Street Fighter there is going to be a ps3 Street

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:31.120
Fighter anniversary collection which actually I think I've brought up before because I mean

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.380
this has been the pictures have been out for a little while but there's more stuff that's

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:42.680
been slated for it what's coming out with this is it looks like it's going to have the

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:51.240
ps1 versions of Street of Street Fighter alpha the Street Fighter alpha 3 for PSP and then

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:58.560
DLC for Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online and 175 PSN avatars really all I care about

01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.940
is the reuse statue all I care about that and I wouldn't buy it on ps3 I'd get it on

01:35:04.940 --> 01:35:10.720
Xbox 360 where I can use a decent controller and then Zone of the Enders there's going

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:16.180
to be the HD collection and it's very cel-shaded and j-poppy it looks pretty good from what

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:32.480
I saw but it's sorry my nose was itching but basically it's going to be there's a why am

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:40.720
I so so tongue-tied today you drink beer no at any rate there's seven minutes of footage

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:48.280
from the game available online and it's like I said cel-shaded has anime style cutscenes

01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:56.280
and it's all j-poppy so moving on from that how about the Steam Summer Sale it's still

01:35:56.280 --> 01:36:05.560
going we've got as of today Max Payne 3 for 30 bucks which is 50% off NO2070 Warhammer

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:36.580
participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on vog network.com use the pass

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:40.640
phrase bowling all right this is the part of the show where we would usually ask the

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.960
frugal question of the week except there was a little bit of Rob failed this week I didn't

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.480
ask anything so I apologize for that but I will go ahead and plug our Facebook and Google

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.560
Plus communities facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and of course you can find us

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:54.960
on Google Plus by searching for orange lounge radio and answer whatever question we post

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.600
next week I was working on other vog stuff literally all afternoon and I usually do the

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:04.040
question there's more songs and network rotation all that stuff now is one thing I was working

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:09.000
on today getting some more of that stuff coded and all that so yep otherwise though sadly

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.800
no question this week but we will have the mailbag coming up after a few more news stories

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:26.640
Loki all right so let's talk a little bit about fun stuff including DRM that just sucks

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:35.200
in Ubisoft you may remember it has the wonderful you play or maybe in this oh yeah wonderful

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:43.200
because their server is down perfect example of why this always connected internet DRM

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:49.520
sucks and Ubisoft's play are you play client or you're not playing because it's offline

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:57.720
right now it's been down for a bit and of course people are pitching a fit because hey

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:04.320
I can't play my Assassin's Creed game or hey I can't you know log in at all and this just

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:14.200
sucks but just kind of wanted to punctuate the fact that you know this not a good method

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:23.360
of DRM in other words here we go again I don't know it's just I don't understand why they

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:35.320
I mean I like let me just quote a few complaints in the cannot log into you play forum on Ubisoft

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:40.880
Ubisoft you're going to be twats and treat your paying customers like criminals who get

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.960
to avoid your crap by partying them to begin with here's a tip if you're going to have

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:56.720
always on DRM make sure your DRM is always fucking on and you know of course we'll see

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:04.840
here how long until the class-action lawsuit probably probably not gonna happen but why

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:09.480
are you kidding Loki this is America of course it's gonna happen it's only before before

01:39:09.480 --> 01:39:13.240
you all blah blah blah to me about the user and agreement and all that stuff you have

01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:19.680
to click OK to please like that stop the guy who is bitching about Microsoft and you know

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:27.760
the kid buying points true that's gonna stop anyone apparently according to their form

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:40.680
manager that it's back up now but I mean I don't know it's just it's just not very very

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.760
good I mean that's the only comment I guess it's been made by those people and apparently

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:48.760
they've been having this problem since yesterday morning it's been almost 24 hours since this

01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:56.920
thing's been down so that kind of sucks Bobby in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:02.740
I am still sad SimCity has always on DRM they did confirm that recently again they hope

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:08.160
to learn from others mistakes with their SimCity always on DRM now granted that's not Ubisoft

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:13.400
but still it's one reason I probably won't buy it the fact that they say that they've

01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:17.600
they want to learn from others mistakes and they have always on DRM proves that they haven't

01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:26.600
learned from other people's mistakes plain simple I mean Diablo had problems yep Diablo's

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.360
continuing to have problems we we went into this a little bit on Horde house plug plug

01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:35.000
this week my other show that's more about the Blizzard stuff especially World of Warcraft

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.760
is that we were talking about how Diablo 3's endgame even Blizzard is it to come out and

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:48.560
say it's not quite what they anticipated and Diablo 3 it's not a flop but from a fanboy

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:55.440
rabidness standpoint like how loyal the fan base is to the game it's losing clout significantly

01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:00.000
significantly over Diablo 2 I know that sounds like a really weird ranking but let me put

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.200
it this way if a Diablo 4 were announced tomorrow people wouldn't be as excited as they would

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:15.040
have been if the game went a little differently that's my point so anyway well also something

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.120
to consider when you know people are when they're pitching you the next expansion to

01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.000
Starcraft 2 or something like that which is still supposed to come out in 2013 who gives

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.280
a shit honestly I mean rabid Starcraft players of which there are still a few but here's

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.680
my thing is I don't here's what I don't understand okay it's an expansion for what I assume is

01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.720
the single player campaign right or co-op campaign or whatever if you're playing multiplayer

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.520
just to play like death matches and stuff like that who gives a shit about an expansion

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:49.480
supposed to add new units and you got it add new units and maps and other things that will

01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:56.200
be unique and I believe the Blizzard Dota will be a part of the new expansion which

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:03.480
is a big deal for some people shit and that's all right now all right if my Hello Kitty

01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:09.120
cross Sonic thing would not make Dark Sakura squee I know this next story will make Dark

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:13.560
Sakura squeeze so pay attention Dark Sakura because announced during the Marvel panel

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:20.800
at this year's San Diego Comic-Con High Moon Studios developing and Activision publishing

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:26.800
a Deadpool game yes and I've seen quite a bit of this and I pleased and it's going to

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:32.440
be launching on who knows what in 2013 we don't know if it's like a next-gen thing or

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:36.480
if it's you know for PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 the usual suspect they say if they got Nolan

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:42.360
North to do the voice again Nolan North will be reprising role as the assassin that was

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:48.240
the one thing that I didn't see and he's like seriously the best voice actor for Deadpool

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:53.080
they didn't specify a whole lot of other answers there were some questions from audience members

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:58.000
and so forth and they said there will be lots more to come and the teaser trailer is now

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.780
out there I want to take a look it's mainly because they can't put out another fucking

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:07.640
spider-man game next year it's just like shit what do we need that they need a new a new

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.560
movie tie-in or game tie-in or Marvel tie-in or something I don't know how about an Avengers

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:19.800
game the Ubisoft sorry put out an Avengers game this year and it sucks so I'm just saying

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:24.800
that's too bad it is too bad how do you fuck up the Avengers game apparently give it to

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:30.480
Ubisoft why do you love Deadpool so much star Sakura for those that may not you know no

01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:35.840
because he's freaking insane and he's like one of the few good things that Liefeld did

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:42.400
because Liefeld just cannot draw people at all but Deadpool is just sort of like yeah

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:45.800
he goes around killing people but he makes jokes he's really funny and he's fucked up

01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.400
in the head and like my old wallpaper for a long time was him killing a horde of clowns

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:55.780
that were attacking him and it was the best thing ever and that he's super funny and everything

01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:59.360
that he isn't except there's way too many Deadpool comics out right now so the market

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:04.180
was way oversaturated and it also gives Liefeld an excuse to draw again and I do not like

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:12.760
Liefeld's drawing and there's that the you know tendency to defect the fourth wall yes

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:16.760
that too because well the only other I think like there's a couple of other Marvel characters

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:23.360
that do that one of them being She-Hulk who her law firm uses old issues of Marvel comics

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:30.160
as legal research so it's pretty funny but yeah she and Deadpool who were two of my favorite

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:34.400
characters break the fourth wall all the time and that and Deadpool talks to his inner voices

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:40.520
and sometimes they tell him he has to pee and other stuff all right uh Darcyra what

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:50.640
do you got for us next to news in news it's not yeah time no no time okay well how about

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:59.000
um valve uh having a counter for EA's uh statement about cheapen cheapening intellectual property

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:05.880
basically EA's um dude said that uh steam's huge sales will cheapen intellectual property

01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:11.260
and that they're not gonna copy that they want the they said the game manufacturer makers

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:15.080
work hard to make the intellectual property and we're not going to be target we're trying

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:20.960
to be Nordstrom did you see that there was a great side-by-side picture of all these

01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.720
games on origin and then what they cost on steam right now and it was it was really something

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:31.720
else but you know in the digital world first off target is really not a bad store I want

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:37.240
to say I proudly shop at Target despite all the anti-gay stuff you're hearing on the internet

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.480
whatever deals though with like actual big-name designers like they worked with Anna Sui they

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.680
were to who's that I think he's already yeah so they get good deals out there and they

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.320
bring designer goods to the average market now if you had said like Nordstrom in the

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:56.380
99 cent clearance center or a store I prefer not to go to in some neighborhoods maybe I

01:45:56.380 --> 01:46:00.040
would understand that a little more but targets not exactly a bad place well here's the other

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:05.360
thing too is they do realize that no one's holding a gun to these developers heads you

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:11.440
know about marking their games down it's something that these developers chose to do or these

01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.000
publishers chose to do well but is it one of them EA because Mass Effect 2 and some

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:23.080
of the older stuff well they're the ones that chose to do that to mark it down so you know

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:27.400
if you don't want cheap in your product then why include yourself in the sale I mean it's

01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:32.480
not steam going okay we're gonna hey hey developer you know what we're just gonna go ahead and

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.920
mark your title down so you're just gonna be getting less money for each copy sold I

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.520
mean they're not doing that they're coordinating with these people that want to be part of

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:46.800
these sales so EA is a bit hypocritical there that they're like oh these guys shocked let's

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:53.160
mark our own tiles we get some more sales well how about I finish the article because

01:46:53.160 --> 01:47:02.800
they interviewed the business development chief Jason Holtman and he was basically saying

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:09.080
you know they're making money for all their partners the discounts serve different functions

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:13.080
that's a quote on here highlighting serves a lot of functions the qualities of the games

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:19.540
serve a lot of functions everything we've seen PC games and IP and all those franchises

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:25.680
are more valuable today than they were four or five years ago and he goes on to say later

01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:31.440
on that we do here's a quote here we do it with our own games if we thought having a

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:37.180
75% sale on Portal 2 would cheap in Portal 2 we wouldn't do it we know that there are

01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:41.960
all kinds of ways customers consume things get value come back build franchises we think

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:49.040
lots of these things strengthen it and they said later on that if we some if we were somehow

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:57.480
on a cycle yeah they're saying that the based on their 40 million users that they haven't

01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:04.760
run into the people waiting for stuff to go on sale that they said that if they were seeing

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:07.720
people just waiting for stuff to go on sale they definitely wouldn't do it with their

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:12.720
own titles but it's their own titles that they put out there first for those super sales

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.040
because people will still order them they'll still wait for that release date they'll still

01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.780
want it day one because they're fans of it and they like the service and they know that

01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:27.240
later on there's going to be another good deal with it you know remember when they gave

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:34.680
Portal away for free yes free and they conveniently did that not long before Portal 2 came out

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:42.160
oh and it was also right in line with the Mac version of Steam so and this one thing

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:47.600
that I really liked is that they recognize that there's a user base on Mac that wants

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.160
to play the games so they're making them available and now we've got them working on Linux so

01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:58.600
they know people aren't just PC gamers hello you know artists like to play games to that

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:03.240
Borderlands game of the year edition for 750 mighty convenient that Borderlands 2 is coming

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.920
out in September yeah a little bit a little bit which you should pick it up pick up both

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:14.200
of them for the lance game of the year three hours left I think I was very very few hours

01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:21.040
left when I purchased it before the show it might already be done all right a few more

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:24.780
stories for you guys and then the mail back oh I'm sorry well the other thing too is that

01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:29.320
origin is still sitting at number two with 11 million registered users and steam has

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:35.480
like I said 40 million and EA is kind of forcing people to register too now to be fair valve

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:39.680
did that too in the beginning and people didn't like it but I'm just saying how much of that

01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:44.480
11 million were people that wanted to sign up for the service or how many are battlefield

01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:49.080
3 and Mass Effect 3 players had no choice I tell you what I still launched Mass Effect

01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:55.080
3 through steam because I can do screen caps you have to turn off origin set it to launch

01:49:55.080 --> 01:50:00.560
independent an independent game and then as it launches it it pulls up origin but you're

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.680
still playing it through the steam platform so you can do screen caps and I'll use all

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:11.040
of the steam goodies a little work around a little bit a few more stories for you guys

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:15.340
and then the mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com to send us an email for a future

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:21.800
week but first Loki so not to be outdone by the summer of arcade the PlayStation Network

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.720
has decided to go ahead and launch PlayStation Network play which is kind of like summer

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:32.200
of arcade during the month of August they're going to release a bunch of different games

01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:36.040
that are going to be kind of part of this including and actually I guess it is part

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:41.280
of July to July 24th August 27th is when it's going to run there's going to be four games

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:48.080
launched on the PlayStation Network papa yo are papo and yo sound shapes counter-strike

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:57.640
global offensive and expendables to video game and I guess if you buy any combination

01:50:57.640 --> 01:51:02.440
of those games you actually get some money back the more you buy the more you get back

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:08.920
two games get you three bucks if you buy all four games you get ten dollars and if you're

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:20.000
a PlayStation plus member you even get 20% on top of all that so it's kind of cool very

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.040
cool let's move on to one more story about Richard Garriott he here he is again in our

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:38.200
show apparently he has raised seven million dollars for a new iOS game it's a social RPG

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.960
right now I guess you know is obviously the portal area in which you know Loki's talked

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:47.160
about at length on the show previously hate that game you hate it because of what happened

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:52.640
with it because it's a piece of junk is just absolute crap I mean if you're gonna play

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:58.860
absolute crap yeah it's kind of cool to collect like old ass nostalgia stuff but it's a piece

01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:07.920
of shit game well this new RPG that he's gonna be funding here is called new Britannia very

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:12.360
interesting that this comes out the same week as the whole Ultima forever thing cuz what

01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:17.920
land did Ultima take place in Britannia so this game called new Britannia is gonna be

01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.800
a social RPG we don't know what other ties it will have to Ultima obviously there's you

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.720
know the whole legal ends to it so be very interesting apparently some other new features

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:32.840
will be in it a synchronous gameplay social profiles so they're gonna Facebook my Ultima

01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:41.240
game hooray Portolarium which is Richard Garriott's new gaming venture is also supposed to be

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:46.440
one of the launch companies in Zynga's partner program well that makes me double excited

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:59.320
about this news yeah let me just save everybody a lot of time that game sucked garage sale

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:08.440
game all right let's go to the mail bag every week you guys email us mailbag at orange lounge

01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:12.760
radio.com we pull out a few of our favorite emails and read them right here on the show

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:22.760
sounded vaguely Kermit like Rob Kermit the e-frog here well at any rate god damn e-mails

01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:30.320
thank you first ones from Jim Sally hey sexies let's say it's sexy Halloween night and your

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:34.240
love buddy wants to dress up sexy for you but as your favorite video game character

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:38.000
who would you want them to dress up as I would totally go for a night with Tifa from Final

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:44.360
Fantasy 7 that shit can knock me out all night let me know XOXO Jim Sally I suppose if I

01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:54.640
say Kayden that's a little bit too obvious isn't it Garris I don't even know that just

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.280
doesn't exist in reality with me I mean that was just because the minute he said something

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.440
about that to his wife the wife would literally point laugh at him I really wouldn't be turned

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:10.160
on by that anyway you know not gonna lie I would a little bit I love my husband exactly

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.720
how he is and I think that dressing up for your significant other is stupid and a waste

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:19.360
of money now I dress up for cosplay necessarily if we cosplay together that would be different

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.320
and then I'd have to pounce him now if you want to pay there's anything wrong with dressing

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.680
up now now if my significant other would pay for a stripper that was dressed up like somebody

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:39.200
then I don't know I still know a hot redhead I don't know pick a hot redhead anyone I don't

01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:54.840
know thumbs up sure okay so moving on this is from clover and Nikon hi I just wanted

01:54:54.840 --> 01:55:00.200
to share a picture of what the children watched one day at vacation care it was an episode

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.600
of the 80s Super Mario Brothers cartoon and we keep up the great show and I will do my

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:10.980
best to visit vogue with more CG art and let me take a look at this picture of course it

01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:15.280
comes up massive on my teeny little screen so I can't it's I did look at the picture

01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:19.500
earlier and they are in their suit they are obviously watching the whole thing somebody

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:25.480
off with the fire finger they are indeed watching the old 80s Mario Brothers cartoon for sure

01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:33.240
okay oh one great and it's a it's it's something all kids should watch it still gets rerun

01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:37.400
on like some like little independent networks like nothing like CBS or whatever but if your

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:42.000
town has a ton of networks like I think for a while the PAX network remember that I don't

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.600
think they're called that anymore I think they're ion or something it's like it's mostly

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:50.120
god shows but like they would also have like randomly like mama's family reruns which was

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:56.080
a great show shut up or Mario Brothers Super Mario Brothers Super Show for a long time

01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:04.440
so anyhow okay so moving forward um hey OLR it's been a while since I've written but I

01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:08.960
wanted to extend a long overdue congratulations on the creation of the vogue network as a

01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:12.600
small business owner myself I understand what a huge undertaking this must have been for

01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:17.560
you and in such a small amount of time it's truly remarkable accomplishment also I miss

01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.780
my opportunity to congratulate you on your landmark 10-year achievement thank you for

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:25.480
all of the laughs and the pure entertainment that you have provided me over the years I've

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:30.200
been listening since 2005 well you know what they say better late than never back to the

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.120
topic of gaming I recently had the pleasure of stumbling upon a fantastic game that I

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:39.360
am truly surprised flew completely under the radar this year binary domain for the ps3

01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:44.760
and 360 it's been one of the most compelling stories of any TPS I've ever played I think

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:51.760
of toilet paper though sorry and is complemented by a truly unique cast of characters in visionary

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:56.440
world think Blade Runner meets Terminator it's got me thinking of how much there must

01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.160
be hundreds of games every year that come out and are met with little to no publicity

01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:04.440
or claim that they deserve can each of you think of a game that you have experienced

01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.880
recently that was truly great but really wasn't covered by most of the major game outlets

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:15.320
and perhaps even overlooked by most gamers I'm not really referring to games like journey

01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:20.880
for instance but that that didn't have the marketing blitz but enjoyed a lot of favorable

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:25.200
coverage by reviewers something more obscure and more underground if something comes to

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:31.800
mind oh I liked fractal that is seem to get a lot of buzz I'm gonna say the cold sept

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:36.300
games like cold sept saga on the 360 and I think I've referenced this on the show before

01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.960
but it's kind of like magic the gathering meets monopoly I'm not sure why these games

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:45.960
aren't like a bigger deal but I guess maybe it's kind of a niche thing but yeah I really

01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.220
like those games and they don't seem like I I didn't even know the 360 one was coming

01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:54.680
out but like I saw like a random ass thing somewhere and I was like they're making one

01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:58.100
but that was several years ago that it came out I'm sure it's near impossible to find

01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:06.280
a copy of it now no in a way DDR kinda I mean incredible crisis remember how we were all

01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:09.720
hooked on incredible crisis oh yeah that's old school that's really old school trying

01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:17.160
to think of like newer stuff yeah imagine party babies rob I found you a copy last night

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:23.500
I loved yes thanks for the text I loved lost odyssey and a lot of people wrote that one

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:30.680
off and I don't know why no I didn't actually realize that WTF came out oh yeah I know but

01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:34.360
I guess I wasn't thinking about it cuz I was like oh is it e3 one's gonna pay for this

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:41.240
you were asleep yeah I was asleep but I found the copy used easy earth defense force you

01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:46.040
and your bugs of course it is an awesome game all right seriously 2017 is a lot better than

01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:51.480
insect armageddon insect armageddon is a more polished game but it didn't sell what they

01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:56.600
had hoped and because of that the publisher didn't really support it and that's kind of

01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:01.680
disappointing because the levels are really limited in it but still great game oh and

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:10.920
of course president cat yes president cat go into our chat room at chat dot vog network

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:17.000
dot com or live dot vog network dot com immortal king says I would have said psychonauts but

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.720
that game applies acidic vampire says lost odyssey is the real Final Fantasy 13 yeah

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:28.640
I went there yep yeah that's cuz Final Fantasy 13 is really Final Fantasy 14 and then 14

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:35.480
doesn't exist all right there's more to that email oh I'm sorry I was looking at this binary

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:40.360
domain thing I don't know a lot about this game I do it's it was a third-person shooter

01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:47.240
game that came up from Sega back in February it looked okay it's basically about robots

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:54.560
hiding themselves among other humans and starting to kind of take over and so it's basically

01:59:54.560 --> 02:00:00.320
this like almost like a SEAL team or something like that coming in to solve this invasion

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:08.400
of Tokyo from these robots there's another game that was similar that kind of flew under

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:12.920
the radar I don't know if it was really good was inversion which had like this gravity

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:17.120
shifting mechanic to it and stuff oh yeah some people I knew were going crazy about

02:00:17.120 --> 02:00:24.400
that one well finish the email sure on a closing note I'd like to give a shameless plug to

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:30.560

months but I can tell you you have a devoted listener now as well as a new vogue member

02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:48.440
boot sucker you're fired Rob my question is directed to you Rob there should be a comma

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.720
by the way after you just saying you're new if you writing us you gotta get the grammar

02:01:53.720 --> 02:02:00.360
tree yeah Jamie does all this all to the new listeners your grammar will be hazed yes it

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.960
will you know that last email that we got had stupendously wonderful grammar one a plus

02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:11.200
for that emailer yeah they went on an invisible gold star I hit it soon we will have loot

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:16.520
on vogue network we can actually do a gold star email award yeah awarded on vogue network

02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:21.040
I will reward you for proper grammar good spelling all right well I want to hear my

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:28.380
question man I hear that you have started playing Final Fantasy 11 again this is my

02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:33.520
very first MMO I ever tried and I fell completely in love with this game as already being an

02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:40.320
FF nut before as life went on and started realizing that this game is such a time sink

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.060
I left the game and started playing wow something a little less hardcore and time-consuming

02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:51.120
than Final Fantasy 11 is you think that's less time-consuming okay yes because you don't

02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:56.280
have the grind I mean you can spend all fucking day and night playing wow but you actually

02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:03.440
will accomplish something true you have me interested in Final Fantasy 11 once again

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:07.320
with some of the changes you have said they have made my question is is there still a

02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:13.480
good amount of people playing okay I'm gonna fix your grammar are there is still a good

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:20.280
amount of people playing is there a lot of downtime LFG or no syllable and still need

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:25.960
groups as a former dark knight what would you suggest my starting job be big fan of

02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:31.560
DPS keep up the good working love you guys Travis okay trying to get some of those questions

02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:36.420
out of the way is it hard to find a group for leveling no not at all because everything's

02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:39.840
done in alliances now it's like when you first start the game you're gonna just head over

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:43.880
to Gus can mines which I which I know is a foreign thing because it's like no no I go

02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:48.440
to the dunes and then I go to quefim island nope now you go to Gus can mines the place

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:54.320
of the scary silent siren and you do the field manual for skeletons and you can group that

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:58.000
all the way to like level 40 and then after that you go to crawler's nest but I mean if

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.400
you get to level 40 in a couple days you're gonna be so freaking happy as it is you'll

02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.240
you'll kind of figure the rest out are there still a lot of people playing the game depends

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:12.520
on your opinion of a lot of people they merge some of the servers some time ago you remember

02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:16.540
how we used to talk about the ferry server when we were talking the room the old days

02:04:16.540 --> 02:04:23.200
of all our the answer there is no more fairy server ha ha with the self server which is

02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:28.100
ironically enough the server that I'm on now which is another type of fairy yes so it's

02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:33.180
appropriate still the fairy service it's just now you know a different name so I I did a

02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:39.160
see all slash see all the other day and there were 1080 people online so I'd still call

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:45.340
that a fair amount of people now what whereas it's easy to find leveling groups people are

02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:49.040
still having a hard time finding groups for missions and things like that and you got

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:54.040
to find your way into a link shell there's still the Juno shouts and all that stuff and

02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:58.720
you might be able to find something but you can expect that some of that will still be

02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.600
a little bit of a weight and that's kind of the problems I'm starting to have with it

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:07.360
is that whereas the leveling thing is awesome the rest of it's less awesome I probably am

02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:10.700
not going to renew past this month Shane told me he's not renewing past the month because

02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:14.440
of other stuff and I'm like I don't want to play by myself and I don't have a link show

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:18.620
on there or anything so I'm like I'll just I'll wait and get Guild Wars 2 when it comes

02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:27.480
out but I like you Thomas 11 wasn't my first MMO but it was the first one I played a lot

02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:33.320
of and so I played a decent amount of it for a little while I had I brought in a bunch

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:38.000
of friends of mine from other forums that I was on to play with us too and like you

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.760
I quit for a while so I think you know what I didn't quit that for a while Oh remember

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:50.640
no no I'm saying like you the emailer I quit for a while yeah I will say this though during

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:55.260
that steam sale that we talked earlier about the abyssia edition 12 bucks on steam right

02:05:55.260 --> 02:06:04.920
now and you get the 30 Loki just lit up no I can't do that it's it's worth checking out

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:11.800
you know what go have a flirt go have a kiki with Final Fantasy 11 for 30 days and with

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:18.080
your 12 bucks just just goes go see it's worth it I don't need more things to take away time

02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:23.760
I'm talking to the emailer again all right that's my answer I get I hit all the questions

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:28.240
the email I hope I did I think yeah but now we need a Mass Effect MMO is that it for emails

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:33.880
yes but Mass Effect give dark Sakura more emails to read make her work mailbag at orange

02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:39.720
lounge radio.com let's do some angst you know what Rob you're gonna do not do something

02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:42.840
you're gonna say that one time and I'm gonna have laryngitis and you'll have to read them

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:50.000
all I'll make Loki do it or I'll get Alan in here Alan Alan read emails okay let's be

02:06:50.000 --> 02:07:12.800
pissy F you to my indigestion I mean I didn't really have anything that was unhealthy I

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:24.920
had salad had beer and coffee so what's up with that F you to a bunch of well here's

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:32.520
the fact that Nellie's car has a screw through the tire so that was fun today putting the

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:41.040
donut on take off work tomorrow and get that fixed which will do for free that's not so

02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:50.800
bad still no that it yeah my a few the week I really don't have anything serious so I

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:55.080
guess I have to do something a little more superficial if you did the fact that I didn't

02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.920
get civilization five for Alan on steam when it was eight dollars and now it's up to a

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:08.160
whole fourteen dollars what am I gonna do so much money God I could buy another copy

02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:14.800
of Final Fantasy of this edition or not all right I'm sorry I don't have a better F you

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:19.360
but things are going pretty well can't complain all right a few more stories for you guys

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:24.720
and then the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or orange lounge radio on Skype

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:32.200
and a few more news stories and Twitter twitter.com slash OLR as I mentioned this week we're getting

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:40.720
a well we got a Minecraft update awesome one point seven three was the update it added

02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:48.680
pit stands and sticky pistons and that's pretty awesome cheers which you can now use to collect

02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:57.080
leaf blocks which don't really work out too well when you're making bushes but you make

02:08:57.080 --> 02:09:02.640
it work I guess also now they have flint and steel is or redstone is required to detonate

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.520
TNT because it was annoying when I accidentally dropped TNT on the ground and I had to encase

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:17.600
the thing in obsidian so that I wouldn't blow anything up in my my house also they're adding

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:24.160
the option for character skins in fact Monday the 16th they're gonna be putting up a pack

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:30.800
of character skins with 40 different skins for like 240 Microsoft points which I'll probably

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:38.320
buying sets a really good deal and yeah but really skins whatever you don't even see yourself

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:44.400
you will see in multiplayer I don't know I think it's a little silly but then again I

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.380
bought lots of silly crap for Mass Effect so I'm not gonna judge you much it's silly

02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:55.280
but whatever the thing that is kind of annoying though is apparently the pistons don't work

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.800
very well in Minecraft if you put too many near each other the game will like out or

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:06.120
crash so that is a can't handle the pistons captain it can't and that is that is unfortunate

02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:09.840
because you can't build some of the stuff that you can on the PC version also there's

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:14.360
a new lighting engine that they added in there which looks pretty nice some people don't

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:20.600
like it because this is too yellow but I think it looks nice and then of course new textures

02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:28.200
for some of the objects including cobblestone which I like a lot better it's less garish

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:34.600
I guess and then also you're gonna be getting some free stuff Rob if you don't like buying

02:10:34.600 --> 02:10:42.600
now you're speaking my language on July 18th you'll be able to get a customized summer

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:51.200
arcade skin pack with five skins in that as well as also if you don't have Minecraft or

02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:56.000
you want to get some stuff for trials evolution you can get new themed tracks they're gonna

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:05.240
be once a week alongside each new game so that's kind of cool very cool and then pro

02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:13.760
skater HD's coming out this was it next week so that could be pretty cool chiggers in our

02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:17.840
chat room at live dot vog network dot com says someone should build castle grayskull

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:23.080
in Minecraft surely that's happened I'm sure it's happened remember everything if you can

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:33.680
dream it it's probably happening on the internet right now I like it up even let's move on

02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:41.640
to one more news story tonight officially and that is about game movies yay god of war

02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:45.440
still supposed to happen still supposed to become a movie at some point the screenplay

02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:52.160
is being rewritten by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan don't recognize those names well you

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:57.240
should pay attention to the credits of saw four five and six because that's the other

02:11:57.240 --> 02:12:03.160
movies they wrote goody goody because those were real winners ask me and to go completely

02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:06.800
off topic yes there's multiple pictures of castle grayskull in Minecraft so it's been

02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:12.600
done multiple times damn you Loki Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan have also written

02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:22.780
such horror film classics as feast feast to sloppy seconds and feast three the happy finish

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:28.040
they will be writing the god of war movie what about fees for the feasting then again

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.520
does the god of war movie really need dialogue when it needs tits and violence I mean that's

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:41.560
that's really what we're looking for and certainly the softball someone to yell you know I really

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:46.000
hate the saw movies you guys I really hate them I miss the last one and I have seen the

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.120
rest of them but I miss the last one cuz you got it you kind of have to see them all if

02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:54.720
you've already watched that many I would rather see this movie at this point this is also

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:59.960
not my kind of movie need for speed don't get me wrong I like the games but I'm not

02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:11.080
a big race car movie fan I'm not like the fast and furious stuff February 7th 2014 is

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:15.120
when the need for speed film is coming out that's amazing considering they haven't shot

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:20.360
any film yet but I guess they're fast tracking it it's going to be directed by an ex stunt

02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:25.320
man which I find interesting it's not based on a specific game in the series it's just

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:29.040
need for speed on a racing move I think it should just be based off the run because that

02:13:29.040 --> 02:13:33.600
was that actually had a plot there will be cars and explosions and that's all you want

02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:41.800
and hopefully tits and violence and there is maybe there'll be a cross-promotion there

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:48.520
God of War racing tighter Klein chat says now the question is is the God of War movie

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:53.520
gonna be pg-13 or our chance with those people it'll be a hard R given their connections

02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:04.040
with saw yeah I'm with you it's probably gonna be a hard R or a fuzzy nc-17 because remember

02:14:04.040 --> 02:14:11.280
violence is okay decapitations that's fine torture porn a-okay you're a hard R but how

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:22.200
if you showed penis or vagina your nc-17 sorry really it's nc-17 if it's male you know anatomy

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.840
being shown well if you want to get tech I don't really care about anyone else's we if

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:33.560
you want to get technical you can show a lady's pubes and you can kind of show like the general

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:39.120
thing from far back like you know oh I know what that is but if like the minute a labia

02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:49.680
shows up or is identifiable now it's nc-17 the more you know okay by the way to ask when

02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:56.360
anyone asked about doing the castle of lions someone actually did Voltron in Minecraft

02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:06.800
just saying there's a check box that says labia it's like labia check does your movie

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:17.320

02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:02.920
on the show playism not familiar with it you know that look yeah yeah because they have

02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:08.520
a lot of mulana oh oh i see where this is going yes

yes i just go ahead you're talking about huh go ahead

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:25.120
no the neat thing is that all these games don't have any drm on them

02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:32.120
well thank god because ubisoft can go kiss off for doing they're screwing up all the

02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:37.600
drm that they're doing in games and if they did that shit to la mulana i would sadly have

02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:47.380
to say don't buy that either yep 15 bucks no drm so just i'm just i'm just curious are

02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:53.960
you getting paid off by the devs of la mulana no because if not you should be yeah you really

02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:58.180

02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:08.200
free pinkberry you really need to get a free copy of la mulana yeah i probably should why

02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:14.640

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:21.600
really great story and this huge world you can explore it's like a metroid or castlevania

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.940
or something but you know what it's got to have tits in it somewhere that's what it is

02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:34.600

02:20:22.240 --> 02:20:27.880
day trial will be up like the week before guild wars 2 is out exactly now here's a question

02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:34.240
for you did you ever play final fantasy 14 i never did no just it's better left into

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:40.000
your imagination it's it's not pretty they should have just made 11 with high definition

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:46.040
graphics and they didn't do that they made they made something a lot sadder sadly i'll

02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:49.600
be honest with you and i was i was so excited about once i heard about it because i was

02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:53.480
like oh wow another mmo from final fantasy and then all of a sudden i heard about how

02:20:53.480 --> 02:20:57.800
horrible it was doing it right in the beginning i was like no i was like it can't happen it

02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:02.880
can't happen like this it was just rushed and it's unfortunate i don't think i i don't

02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:06.480
know what the hell they were thinking like they they said they were getting inspiration

02:21:06.480 --> 02:21:09.820
from world of warcraft and stuff and i didn't see any of that like i saw that they were

02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:13.960
trying to do some of the like 60 minute you know things you could do in more bite sizes

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:19.320
that you do in final fantasy 11 and i i respect them for that but final fantasy 11 implemented

02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:24.920
some of those things and kind of one upped it it's really weird when you're thinking

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:31.600
like gosh final fantasy 11 i really missed that game 14 eh yeah exactly well congratulations

02:21:31.600 --> 02:21:35.880

Travis that's it all right take care buddy all right later what we should get a ferret

02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:21.600
for real they're not that smelly i'm gonna start a kickstarter to make how about we go

02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:27.560
to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh this is mourmet but i'm

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:32.640
not in chat right now i'm using uh i'm using the iphone right now that's all right oh i

02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:36.880
see you can you know in the iphone you can't you got to just use the phone part that's

02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:43.400
all right what's up buddy um i was just wanting to talk about the uh the whole import issue

02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:51.840
that was going on uh last week uh with the final fantasy uh get rid of and uh i guess

02:22:51.840 --> 02:23:00.780
the also the um persona arena and how everybody felt about it well yeah i was gonna say the

02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:06.840
import issue is specifically about persona am i right because there's the whole uh issue

02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:15.320
where it's he hung up you don't want to talk to us anymore what happened he just hung up

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:21.480
bad signal user error no maybe that maybe he death gripped the iphone i don't know what

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:26.280
happened um yeah because i think there's an issue with the rhythm sense the rhythm is

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:30.380
a region lock game anyways and that's kind of a region lock system it was just that this

02:23:30.380 --> 02:23:36.280
is a region free system that has its first region locked game which is a little odd well

02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:40.080
i'm gonna see if that number comes back through because i you know i want to know a little

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.480
more about like what his perspective was on that because i kind of think we got it out

02:23:43.480 --> 02:23:47.680
there in the open last week that well we never did resolve the theater of the thing but you

02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:51.440
know obviously we have the different opinions on that and then as far as the persona games

02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:55.980
go you know we didn't see the point for getting really upset about it because they are putting

02:23:55.980 --> 02:24:00.560
out the exact same game in both regions i only get pissed about region locking when

02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:06.920
japan gets these games that either we never get or like take president cat was a perfect

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:13.320
example it was this whimsical silly game that you know they should have really made it here

02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:17.400
and why can't i import it if they're never going to release it ever ever maybe it would

02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:23.480
have sold better i don't know they bring a lot of weird stuff over here i'm surprised

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:27.880
that that never did come over here all right well since the number is not calling back

02:24:27.880 --> 02:24:31.120
so i'll say this much since your chat connect or since your phone connection isn't working

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.000
out too well get in chat and tell us the rest of the question there or what your perspective

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:41.920
is on that so we can better answer it would be great 1877 game olr or a username on skype

02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:45.340
is orange lounge radio i have a couple other quick stories i want to work in here because

02:24:45.340 --> 02:24:49.320
they're from twitter tiger claw tweeted us a few stories and bobby was talking to me

02:24:49.320 --> 02:24:54.720
about this one too and i think this is pretty interesting in dark sakura pay attention universal

02:24:54.720 --> 02:25:00.080
studios in konami are partnering uh universal studios and i'm not talking about the movie

02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:03.380
studio i'm talking about the amusement park you know there's one in orlando there's one

02:25:03.380 --> 02:25:10.280
here in la they are teaming up together for halloween horror nights and apparently silent

02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:17.360
hill is going to be getting a replica at this year's halloween horror nights that is going

02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:24.440
to be this october at both the hollywood and orlando parks ooh wait when uh just for halloween

02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:29.260
october yeah they do something like all month long because um if i go down for disneyland

02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:34.120
that means i'll be down in the area yes our other friends adrian and gabe who don't listen

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:39.080
to this show but they go they always take a day and not go to disneyland but they go

02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:44.560
to uh universal studios so you should think about doing something similar and go to silent

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:49.560
hill i've never been to universal studios please don't get killed by pyramid head okay

02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:52.680
or at least give them a hug i'll hump them that same number is calling back so i want

02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:57.880
to try and get back to the phone hi you there yes i'm sorry about that i think i got the

02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:02.960
iphone yeah see i called it i called it all right so what what was it you wanted to say

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.640
about it i mean do you do you have perspective on it or were you looking for our perspective

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:12.920
or what's your opinion on the whole region locking okay well i um pick i'm i normally

02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:17.520
pick up uh import games on the regular and i picked up get rid of them back in uh february

02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:24.080
and march and uh it was great and i also was you know was about to pick up a sonar arena

02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:28.360
when i until i found out that they were going to region lock it only because i didn't buy

02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:34.160
the ps3 in japan because it was you know what the region locks but this issue really doesn't

02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:42.160
have anything to do with um but america this is more like japan i think afraid of um you

02:26:42.160 --> 02:26:46.960
know japanese people start buying their games because you know i tend to you know play a

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.120
lot of japanese rpgs i've to the point i can i can read japanese pretty pretty effectively

02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:56.560
online and and you know i kind of even like you know help out with the little team that

02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.360
they're that they have especially with the tails game so um i just wanted to just you

02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:08.000
know let people know that if you really want to like you know play like any employee games

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.280
you know the prices for us won't really change and this is really for japan this is really

02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:18.640
for like maybe having japan have you know cheaper prices but not but the people that

02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:23.720
buy games out there don't really you know pay too much attention to you know the you

02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:28.160
know the gaming environment here in america it's a whole different environment over there

02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:33.680
you know people sure i mean like games are always 100 ps3 games or uh i think theater

02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:39.120
with them with eighty dollars sure and i remember hearing a lot about that that the uh finances

02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:44.640
was it was maybe more region locked to protect the japanese version of the game because it

02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:47.560
was going to be more expensive and people were legit worried that they were just going

02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:53.140
to be importing copies from america let me ask you this though from a consumer perspective

02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:59.160
or the gamer perspective you and i and especially somebody like you who plays a lot of import

02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:04.160
games and you know definitely i'm sure cares about retaining some of that original japanese

02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:08.420
atmosphere as i understand that persona is going to be the exact same game in both regions

02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:12.400
right so from our perspective we're getting a good end of the deal here it's okay that

02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:19.080
it's region locked right right it's okay because i believe it's coming out for um america i

02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:24.180
think within two weeks of the uh the release of the japanese one you're right you're right

02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:29.520
yes so you know i don't you know i just i don't think the body block will will show

02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:34.160
as well a conflict over two years so i i think i assumed that you kind of believe what bobby

02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:40.120
was saying and uh his friend you know about him i was going to boycott bears and i don't

02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:45.280
know i always find it there that i just really thought people need to just relax it isn't

02:28:45.280 --> 02:28:49.720
too much of a problem i think this is a big you know scam problem you know because when

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:54.720
they have their very decent amount you know they literally you know devices i think power

02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:00.600
freddy 13 and i bought it uh just from japan like 115 dollars no joke then like two weeks

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:05.240
later because people had a problem with it it dropped to like 50 dollars yeah it's like

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:11.560
this is like in japan imports they were like change their prices um the websites but in

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:16.440
japan that's how it was i don't want to speak for bobby because i'm not bobby but i believe

02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:21.240
his perspective was pretty similar to ours where i he did not i think he really didn't

02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:26.680
understand why people the consumers were getting so upset about the region locking because

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:31.560
it was the same game coming out in both regions and you know and they they had taken the extra

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:36.160
step to preserve the japanese language track even because they know the target audience

02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:39.640
for these types of games usually tends to overlap a lot with the same type of people

02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:43.700
that are really into japanese culture so he wasn't understanding why people were getting

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:47.600
so upset about it i think he kind of saw it from the same perspective we're getting at

02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:53.080
now i don't know about the callers yeah and he does he just clarified in chat i have no

02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:59.720
problem with the region locking of persona 4 for the record okay so if the games continue

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:05.720
to come out like that uh i guess america wouldn't really see much of a problem now is that what

02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:11.200
you're saying yes i'll tell yeah as far as i know yes as long as it's the same game it's

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:15.040
fine and as long as it's kind of like that same window and so forth it's totally fine

02:30:15.040 --> 02:30:20.960
i'll give you an example of what pisses me off the way xenoblade was handled that pissed me off

02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:26.640
that was a terrible thing that they did because that was a great game they released in japan you

02:30:26.640 --> 02:30:32.080
know on the we right and then it comes out in europe and they have that version and then we have

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:38.080
to wait six months after that which that's not even the part that really bothers me because

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:42.640
europe sometimes gets that end of the shaft it kind of works in reverse so that part doesn't

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:48.880
really bother me but a the wheeze region lock so i can't really import it and b when they end up

02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:55.760
releasing it here it's a fucking game stop exclusive that pissed me off exactly yeah see

02:30:55.760 --> 02:31:02.720
that this is this is what uh i really think is gonna be the next um issue for like gamers that

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:08.000
are come back and play games here in america or in europe or in japan because now our world are

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.800
being flattened and now we can actually see a little bit more and more people are buying it

02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:18.320
i really feel like you know a consumer that wanted to play xenoblade would have found the way to play

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:23.040
whether they would import it or pirated it they would have found their way of playing it so like

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:29.120
so for them to wait six months only hurts them because i don't even walk into a game stop anymore

02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:33.120
you know i only i'd when i want to go ahead and buy it you know any different game top if you

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:38.080
were to buy a console that's reason lock or if there's a particular reason and you like a cable

02:31:38.080 --> 02:31:43.440
or something but anything you know i think the average employee gamer it's kind of like savvy

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:50.320
enough to buy games online on other ways like like the kavita like the new hux unique look

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:55.120
would be coming out here like it there's a military simulation game people like it but it

02:31:55.120 --> 02:31:59.360
may not come out here for a while but you know whoever likes you know those games can now can

02:31:59.360 --> 02:32:04.640
download them from the uh i believe they can buy them from the playstation store if they buy

02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:11.680
japanese beta which makes it great because it kind of bypasses the import problem so i i just i just

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:15.920
think we're going to see this more often more you know as time goes on it's going to be great because

02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:21.520
you know uh i think that some of the games that are actually coming out you can play them even

02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:28.080
if you don't know any japanese you know for instance i think you and i are on similar pages

02:32:28.080 --> 02:32:33.200
i think if if um you know project diva and all that was on the same page as persona 4 and the

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:37.920
way they're doing it region locking wouldn't bug me whatsoever but unfortunately you know you got

02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:44.880
to remember the roots of this show we were hardcore ddr and beatmania fans and for so long konami's

02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:52.080
putting out all these great beatmania 2dx mixes in japan and then they put one out here that sure

02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:55.840
it's got a better controller slightly because they've had some time to perfect it but then the

02:32:55.840 --> 02:33:01.360
the song list itself and there really ain't shit you can do about it on the playstation

02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:08.800
too but get a japanese playstation too it's crazy all right well thanks so much for the call buddy

02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:13.040

02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:02.320

borderlands now because i of the two games i wanted to install one before i came to the show

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:46.400
