14118	19401	Tonight, July 22nd, 2012, has a hugely anticipated title been cancelled?
19822	24245	Microsoft secretly steps up security, and Steam heads to another platform.
31536	36738	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36798	42080	It is episode number 466 for this July the 22nd of 2012.
42700	51324	We're here to talk about video games and the gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle with you guys who are participating live at the VOG Network.
51844	55047	Live.VogNetwork.com to get in the chat room and chat with us.
55507	60051	And of course, we want to acknowledge the folks listening along in the podcast form as well.
60431	65395	I know a lot of us listen to us on their Mondays to help get through the workday or throughout the week or what have you.
65435	67377	So thanks for tuning in and thanks for participating.
68117	69078	Hi, I'm doing good.
88576	92477	You are playing a game over there that you're giggling like crazy over.
92577	93017	What is this?
93317	94677	I want to be the guy Gaiden.
94937	95498	Oh, dear.
96338	96778	Oh, dear.
97478	101119	I remember I want to be the guy was one of those like impossible games, right?
101259	104180	I just like the look of it now because it's all 16-bit-ish now.
104680	106680	And it's got a lot of homages.
106840	109161	Well, obviously, the first one had a lot of homages to stuff.
109561	113222	But, I mean, the first level is it's buying a Capando.
113262	114422	So, I mean, it's pretty awesome.
114762	117944	What is the appeal of these games that are just impossible to beat?
118064	120145	It's not impossible, they're just really hard.
121566	122327	Next to impossible.
122347	122947	Well, here's the thing.
123127	125749	I have a couple reasons why I'm playing.
125889	126649	One, because it's fun.
128070	129671	Well, it's hard, but it's still fun.
129791	138256	Two, because I'm thinking one of two things is going to happen for the next gate challenge for Ready Player One stuff.
138597	142399	It's going to either be a game that's hard like this, or it's going to be a text adventure game.
143920	144560	Be my guess.
145381	147142	I'm not good at either one of those.
148003	149784	It's time to go back and study up on Zork.
150244	153607	Pretty much, yeah, because that was one of the challenges in the book was Zork.
153647	155108	Oh, okay.
156469	156769	Yeah.
157370	159031	You are standing in front of a White House.
159071	160072	There is a mailbox here.
160132	160532	What do you do?
162753	163634	Open mailbox.
164675	165355	Take letter.
166216	168998	You better read up on your FAQs for the old school Zork games.
171188	171549	All right.
172089	177613	Well, also joining us here, since DarkSakura is not here, we like to invite other people to come on and host.
178074	182577	And we have our old favorite standby host who doesn't have a choice because he lives here.
182677	184378	Say hello to Alan.
184919	185259	Hello.
185439	186040	How are you, Alan?
186140	186560	I'm great.
187061	187401	Awesome.
187421	188622	Well, thank you for coming back tonight.
189222	189702	You're welcome.
189942	190563	What's new with you?
190663	194144	You're like, I asked a bunch of people, I can't get a guest host.
195044	196045	You have to do it.
196685	198626	And I was like, oh, so I'm like sixth choice.
198726	199486	That's great to hear.
199686	203747	I asked one other person and then I was too lazy to ask anyone else.
203827	204428	That's fair.
204588	206268	Just, you know, tap, tap, tap.
206528	206709	Yes.
207009	212371	And the other person I asked was Flaco Jones, who, you know, to be fair, was here that night.
212391	213071	He's bad luck.
213231	213631	He's me.
213671	214471	He makes power go out.
214531	215072	Yeah, that's true.
215132	216172	Maybe it's best you stay away.
216232	217232	Stay away, Flaco Jones.
217312	217593	I'm kidding.
217613	218093	I'm kidding.
218153	218513	I'm kidding.
219133	220614	But he has like babies and things.
221774	225736	When you have babies and things, priorities and all this stuff.
227837	228418	I understand.
228918	234180	Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show at live.vognetwork.com.
234600	235901	Actdeft starts us off tonight.
236121	237882	Alan, the host without a choice.
241260	241460	DarkSakura
260709	285503	but Tiara and Dan are both two of the big writers at the site Geek Life or geek-life.com and we've done a lot of stuff with them over the years they've been really wonderful in promoting us and we've tried to promote them where we can they got married today geek-life.com a geek wedding happened today in Las Vegas and of course since Jamie and Tiara go way back she flew down there for the wedding so I think that's great
285703	287363	What geek theme did they have for the wedding?
287523	291044	I know they had like a giant Doctor Who... It's Doctor Who everything.
291124	294805	Yeah, it's like they had like a giant Doctor Who TARDIS cardboard thing.
294825	298046	And the cake topper is them.
298346	298606	Yes.
298806	301386	Yeah, it might be Amy and what's his name?
301466	304507	I think they're... Yeah, it's kind of like them as... Because Amy's got red hair and Tiara's got red hair.
304567	305007	Exactly.
305067	306727	It's kind of like them as Doctor Who characters.
307027	312869	Well, you can read more about it at geek-life.com because Tiara does a series called Bride and the Geek.
313449	314589	Or is it Beauty and the Geek?
314609	314729	No.
315169	317212	Now I sound like a terrible person because I don't know the name.
317752	319354	I think it's Beauty and the Geek, actually.
319714	326662	But it's about them setting up and planning their wedding, and I thought it was a really cute series, even if the name escapes me right now because I'm under pressure.
327903	331427	But DarkSakura will be back next week, but we can certainly understand.
331487	334510	She wanted to go to the bachelorette party, which looked like it was last night.
335452	345583	And I think they checked into a chocolate place So, you know, with girls If they're not going to go see the stripper thing and do that What do girls love more than strippers?
345883	351790	Chocolate So it makes sense that they would go to a chocolate place Of which I guess there is one in Vegas
354272	354732	Let's see.
355093	358914	ImmortalKing in our chatroom says, DarkSakura too busy dodging the bouquet.
359334	361255	You know, DarkSakura is married.
361455	363816	She's talked about her husband, Dan, several times on the show.
364177	368659	I believe that makes you ineligible to even go out to the floor when they ask, where are the single ladies?
369199	369959	Put your hands up.
370579	373361	You know, so DarkSakura would not qualify to catch the bouquet.
374441	379468	I will point out that I did catch the garter at a wedding a couple years ago.
380209	382052	That was when Mel and Mel got married.
382372	383073	I caught the garter.
383934	385957	So, still waiting.
387940	389822	That's alright, I've caught the garter before too.
392495	418141	Alright Let's see Also in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw says What Sky is trying to say is Tonight's show is a sausage fest Maybe, but we will open it up to callers later on And maybe some lovely ladies will call in Because I know we do have some gals that listen to OLR Or maybe we'll get some emails Or some tweets From all genders later on So we'll find out We'll probably just get Jim Sally
420182	420782	Steam sale!
443973	444773	That's right.
445013	450475	I want to talk about how has the Steam sale damaged your life or your wallet?
451196	452476	Steam sale going on.
452516	454437	I believe it ends tomorrow.
454677	456718	I don't know if that means tomorrow at 10 a.m.
456818	460059	and it's done or if that means there's like one last final hurrah.
460958	468463	I got my meta achievement of voting on the community's choice every day of the sale today.
468623	469804	That means today's last day.
469864	470284	That's that.
470344	472425	Well, it says prices through the 23rd.
473166	475267	So I think today's sales are going to run through like 2 p.m.
475307	475627	tomorrow.
475868	476788	And then I think it's going to be over.
476988	477649	Right, then it's over.
477669	483672	Well, there were some like from yesterday that expired in eight hours from when I bought them earlier.
484673	487795	So probably, yeah, through tomorrow.
488820	494284	So, I wanted to go around and see how did the Steam sale wreck your wallet this week?
495364	497606	Loki, how did the Steam sale wreck your wallet?
497686	502089	Well, before I had purchased Skyrim and Borderlands, actually it was pretty good this week.
502249	510675	I almost bought Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon, but then I remembered how much I... It was a fun game, but it's not worth owning twice.
511275	516579	Unlike, you know, Earth Defense Force 2017, which I owned a lot of times.
519941	524644	I bought Arma 2, the pack they had.
524724	528766	It was with Arma 2 and the expansion for like $20.
530127	530627	I got that.
531027	535730	I almost considered San Andreas, but I don't want it.
537071	537211	So...
538852	540054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
556834	560277	Um, but yeah, so Arma 2 is only the new thing that I bought.
560597	566201	But, uh, I'm looking forward to checking out DayZ, which is that zombie, uh, thing that they've got.
566261	569483	It's supposed to be all sorts of craziness and boring at the same time.
569763	572945	Isn't the orange box half, like, every Half-Life thing?
573085	577988	Yeah, it's Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Episode 1, and Episode 2, and, well, and then the original game.
578349	580310	And then, uh, Portal and Team Fortress 2, but...
582151	584833	I don't need to play through Portal again because I've played through that a few times.
584853	587816	I'm pretty sure Alan would tell you Half-Life is the best thing you're going to get.
588336	592359	It's really... I play Half-Life 2 and the episodes like twice a year.
592560	596363	But the thing is with that is they mark this stuff down all the time.
596463	599145	So it's not like, oh, I missed my only opportunity for this.
599225	599425	I mean...
600726	624971	seriously they mark this stuff down all the time and I'm sure if I go to a GameStop or something like that I'm sure they got a copy of the orange box on PC or even Half-Life 2 just sitting there rotting that I could probably take off their hands for you know nothing let me ask a completely random tangential question because we're talking about Half-Life and you know I know that it seems like Valve is trolling you with Half-Life 3 right Alan
626369	630575	either Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 Episode 3 whatever they want to do.
631516	633338	But it seems like nothing's ever going to happen, right?
633358	641168	Yeah, it's now been longer from Half-Life Episode 2 to current day than it was from Half-Life 1 to Half-Life 2.
642029	647474	Do you worry that if Half-Life 3 ever does come out at some point that it's going to be like Diablo 3?
648115	659424	And what I mean by that is I think most people, not all, but most people kind of consider Diablo 3 a letdown for a variety of reasons, be it that auction house or the lack of offline play or something.
659445	664129	I think the only reason why there hasn't been Half-Life 3 is because they need to develop a new engine.
664149	668933	I mean, they've been using the Source engine forever now, so it's time that they come out with a new engine.
669611	670213	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
677463	681747	It reminds me of the series Lost and how weird it was.
683068	686030	Some of the fans were like, they totally know how it's going to end.
686071	690054	And the other half of the fans were like, they're making this shut up as they go along.
690775	695719	Half-Life, I'm afraid the story might get too big for them to rein in.
696399	697560	And the story might be weird.
697701	700863	But otherwise, it's just going to be a first-person shooter.
700883	701664	Yeah.
702326	708343	Valve's pedigree is very high, so I don't really expect them to drop the ball that much on it.
709584	713465	GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com seems to agree with Loki.
713505	717826	I think Half-Life 3 will come out if and only if they create a new engine for their games.
718006	718627	They need a Source 2.
719707	722788	I think they are going to create a new engine for their game because it's getting dated.
723308	730810	They make good games and the engine still looks pretty nice, but they're going to need to come out with something at some point.
731150	733871	It's going to have to happen because it's going to get dated.
735137	742644	Yeah, because Source as it is, which the first generation of it was 2003 or 2004 when Half-Life 2 came out, it's been updated four or five times.
742924	743185	Yeah.
743405	746107	But it's still the core engine.
746227	747368	Is that what's running Portal 2?
747749	748129	Yes.
748309	748590	Wow.
749010	752073	Modified Source and Left 4 Dead 2 is also Modified Source.
752113	754855	Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2, they both still look great.
754935	758599	But I understand the desire to... It's the physics and stuff.
759159	759840	That's all the same.
760080	762262	Maybe Valve is waiting for the next wave of consoles.
762322	764284	Maybe at this point, don't make a PlayStation 3 game.
764324	768007	They just need to come out with a game that's just all the source games kind of combined into one.
768027	771290	You got a little bit of Half-Life, you got a little bit of Portal in there, a little bit of Left 4 Dead.
773171	774492	Just a mixing of everything.
774512	775894	A little bit of Team Fortress 2.
776514	781338	Half-Life 2 Episode 3 was supposed to heavily involve Aperture Science.
782479	798684	and because Portal was such a huge hit, it almost makes me wonder if they're like, if they want to keep those worlds separate now because you're supposed to go up to the North Pole or the South Pole to find the ship and blah, blah, blah.
798904	804525	So yeah, Aperture Science was supposed to be in Episode 3 and now I don't know if they're trying to write their way around that.
804545	807866	Because of all the story in Portal 2 about Aperture Science, certainly.
808006	810827	Yeah, that could be an interesting monkey wrench.
811307	813128	Anyhow, I didn't mean to get us too far on the tangent.
813408	815549	Let's go back to how Steam sale wrecked your week.
816509	818610	Anything else, Loki, that you bought on the sale?
818930	819510	No, that was it.
819550	820791	Just those three games.
821531	821951	I'll go.
822791	833955	I bought Civilization V for Alan because just like how I bully him into coming on this show, clearly, I'm going to talk to him about playing Civ V with me.
834035	834876	Aren't you excited?
835056	835296	Yes.
835916	836597	I installed it.
837417	837978	Hooray!
838118	839178	That's progress.
839919	848265	I bought Civ V Gods and Kings for myself because it was like 20% off, which I figured for a game that's only like two months old is probably as low as it's going to get.
848705	849366	So I bought that.
849886	856111	And I bought a four pack of Dungeon Defenders because it was cheap and I heard it's kind of good.
856211	857112	So I bought that.
857352	858333	Why'd you buy four of them?
859193	862494	so that I could give Alan one, and I gave one to Shane.
862614	864635	What is Dungeon Defenders anyway?
864655	866315	I haven't decided what I'm doing with the fourth one yet.
866335	868056	It's co-op tower defense, I think.
868296	868916	That sounds fun.
869556	870737	Do you not have it, Loki?
870897	871357	I don't have it.
871377	872077	Well, now you do.
872157	873237	There's my fourth copy.
873298	874018	There you go.
874038	874938	I bought it for Loki.
874958	876879	I did it for you, bro.
877139	877359	Thank you.
877439	877839	All right.
878019	878479	There you go.
878499	882140	You know, that's one genre I haven't really gotten into, tower defense stuff.
882560	883461	Well, actually, I guess I have.
883501	886642	I play the stick war games on iOS, but I don't know.
886902	887282	It'd be fun.
889062	889363	All right.
889603	890983	And I'm trying to think.
891003	891623	There was something else.
891703	891983	Oh, yeah.
892464	895164	I bought Skyrim, which I think I talked about on last week's show.
895384	896245	My memory is a little fuzzy.
896285	900466	But I bought Skyrim on PC just because I wanted to be able to mod it.
900806	905708	And, you know, I had it on PlayStation 3, but it's just not PC.
906088	909869	And I got to say, after installing that high-res texture pack and everything...
910578	911198	Very nice.
912039	912680	Very nice.
913540	914561	Very nice looking game.
915001	916742	And all the mods are very cool.
916822	919685	And the Steam Workshop, and it's very easy to get that stuff in there.
920085	922126	And Alan, Alan's great.
922166	924928	He sent me an email saying like, okay, here are the must-have mods.
924948	926429	You need this and this and this and this.
926469	927430	And he just gave me a list.
927490	928671	All quality of life stuff.
929111	933314	Like the default UI for inventory and spells is shit.
933654	935076	So here's a mod that makes it pretty.
935096	935176	Yeah.
936176	942118	TigerClaw who's participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com says can your PC run Skyrim fine?
942578	943898	Yeah, it's running great.
944018	948499	I don't think it's like the highest highest settings but my video card's fairly new.
948639	952520	It's only about a year old and you know I have a fairly powerful PC.
952560	953480	It's just very loud.
953520	958462	That's the only problem with my PC is that when the fans are running You should hear mine because it's under the desk.
958482	959262	That's why it's muted.
959762	960342	Mine's a beast.
960462	964203	Your PC's way better than mine and I run games fine so you shouldn't have a problem.
964643	972265	My PC at home, I need to upgrade everything on it because that was back when the 8800 NVIDIA cards were new.
973365	987249	So I have a dual 8800 GTS 512s running an SLI and have a dual core because it was a core 2.0 before they had all these i5s, i7s, and stuff like that.
987789	989650	But it's overclocked to almost 4 gigs.
989950	990310	Yeah.
991610	996530	But, you know, those cards kind of hold it back.
997568	1005570	Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 Eastern at VODnetwork.com every Sunday night, is sending a link.
1006330	1007851	I saw your tweet on this earlier, Bobby.
1007871	1008691	That's how I know what this is.
1008751	1017173	It's the Minecraft mod for Skyrim that actually changes your companion to Steve, the Minecraft dude and all that, which is funny.
1017193	1021654	I'm just afraid once I do start modding this is it's going to get weird really fast.
1022094	1025896	because I'm going to have to get the Macho Man dragon mod.
1027017	1028378	Oh, I got to get that still.
1028438	1029599	Thank you for reminding me.
1030239	1038344	That one also, a quick, I guess a... We actually have somebody in chat too named Macho Man, so maybe you'll get an oh yeah.
1038804	1047808	So there's also, you know, in case you're not a Macho Man fan, they have the Milo Pony ones that turn the dragons into that.
1047928	1050249	And the extra magic one is pretty cool.
1051650	1053171	Let's just be real.
1053311	1054632	It's for the weed smokers.
1055912	1058613	They have the brony mod for the weed smokers.
1060474	1062375	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1063435	1064195	I'm just saying.
1064395	1069256	I just want to see what kind of... I mean, it's going to look nothing... That's the fun of it.
1069296	1070317	Like, I've played Skyrim.
1070337	1070917	Skyrim's fun.
1071437	1072637	And I'm still playing it on 360.
1073117	1076438	I haven't picked up DLC because I think it's a waste of money right now.
1076878	1084560	But I just want to make the PC version look nothing like the original game and just have it be frigging crazy.
1085080	1087101	Just batshit crazy.
1088137	1093089	BlackWolf is also asking in chat, can Alan post his essential Skyrim mod list to the forums?
1093840	1097682	Well, I've actually been trying to nudge him into doing an article for the site on that.
1097742	1098722	Nudge, nudge, nudge, nudge.
1099423	1100923	Can I talk about the Steam Workshop?
1101163	1101824	Yes, sir.
1102364	1110608	As someone who likes to mod PC games, the Steam Workshop is amazing in how incredibly easy it is to just install a mod.
1110768	1112489	And if you don't like it, it's gone.
1112809	1114690	It's like a one-click process within Steam.
1115130	1118992	The problem that I have with it is that a lot of really awesome mod authors...
1120353	1125898	aren't on it just because they're fine with Nexus, which was the old school modding site.
1125938	1131444	So there's a lot of amazing Skyrim mods, especially UI and quality of life stuff, that isn't on the Steam Workshop.
1131984	1138891	So if I make a list, I can say, here's how you install stuff from Nexus, but here's the easy stuff from Steam Workshop.
1138951	1139371	I don't know.
1139591	1140572	I think it's okay.
1141353	1144376	I have faith that most of our listeners could figure it out.
1144416	1145096	Well, yeah.
1145817	1153403	A lot of people are intimidated by modding, and the Steam Workshop is absolutely an amazing progression.
1153663	1157846	It's very innovative on that stuff, but it kind of split the community up a bit.
1158107	1159928	Because now there's two different sources for mods.
1160088	1163911	Actdeft is trying to share this mod that he says I should get called the Yay Mod.
1164411	1166793	He says, screw the Macho Man mod, get the Yay Mod.
1166813	1168014	And I'm like, dear God, what is that?
1168034	1168995	And he sent me a YouTube.
1169495	1172338	Usually I don't play YouTubes on the show without looking at them first, but...
1172998	1199982	for yay mod, I'll take a risk Actdeft, don't ruin my show here we go, let's see so the guy's in the dungeon let's see what happens if you don't know the elements of good cheer yet you should try out these cheat codes I don't know what that's gonna do alright Actdeft, when does this get good uh oh, the guy's typing it in let's see what happens
1203186	1204447	This video's only a minute and a half long.
1208429	1208829	Come on.
1214872	1215472	Okay.
1216313	1217093	Nothing good's happening.
1219494	1223556	Actdeft, you're bringing the show- He should've just gave you a timestamp and said bump it to like a minute five.
1229299	1232021	I'm more interested in this because everything's in German right now.
1235882	1237964	I'm sure dragon shouts in German are terrifying.
1238604	1244129	I just realized it says My Little Pony Friendship is Magic in the title, so I'm a little worried.
1247452	1250875	I might need to smoke a little bit of something before this will actually make sense.
1251195	1251876	Is that the trick?
1254278	1254598	Uh-oh.
1255259	1257741	It's probably a dragon shout that's My Little Pony.
1257761	1259683	Yeah, there's now a dragon shout that says yay.
1259703	1259783	Yay.
1261519	1264582	Now to the fun part with 10 seconds left in the video.
1264602	1266243	That's it.
1266263	1266363	Yay.
1274348	1276910	I give that on a scale of 1 to 10 about a 1.5.
1276990	1278570	Sorry, Actdeft.
1278710	1279871	That was a stoppage of the show.
1280351	1285713	Yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat said, Wolf rather, that he's installed mods from Nexus.
1285913	1296118	Nexus does have its own little Nexus mod manager app, but a lot of people are like, I don't want to install this 5 meg little weird-ass app.
1297078	1301100	So it kind of has a Steam Workshop alternative, but yeah, I can post all that through the forums.
1302546	1302926	Sounds good.
1303126	1303306	Yeah.
1304186	1321831	Oh, and another thing about the Steam Workshop, and this is because I'm a huge pervert, sometimes mods, modders, especially in like the Grand Theft Auto franchise, like to make people naked or make their clothes really slutty, even if you strip them and they still have underwear on, just like cleavage and the big boobs.
1322371	1324351	They're not, that stuff's not on Steam Workshop.
1324711	1331473	So if you want an NC-17 R-rated Skyrim like I do, you're going to want to go to Nexus for that.
1332460	1335461	They do some good work on Lydia.
1336181	1341222	Yeah, there's a bunch of Lydia mods where it's not appropriate for this show.
1342323	1345223	This show is appropriate for everything.
1345863	1347824	This isn't a Bobby Blackwolf show, Alan.
1347844	1351825	They have some deep cleavage for those characters.
1352845	1353125	All right.
1353866	1355948	Alan, what was the damage for you this week?
1356008	1357610	Because I know you went shopping.
1357710	1357990	Oh, yeah.
1358070	1364957	I think from the very first day of the sale, I think it's dinged me collectively for I want to say 50 or 55 bucks.
1366738	1369881	But it's 350 here, 899 here.
1370802	1372984	The big thing that I got was Saints Row 3.
1374205	1390474	was knocked down to like $7.49 and then that plus all of the DLC all of it I think was like $22.99 so I picked that up just inhaled all that down spoiler most of the DLC sucks actually spoiler all of the DLC sucks
1392046	1398891	One thing I noticed, and you're the one who pointed this out, there's the daily sales that actually last about two hours.
1398911	1403194	There are the flash sales and then there are the community vote sales.
1403275	1410160	Those prices have been cycling through every day or like twice a day every other day for the whole sale.
1410640	1415584	It's a genius move on Valve's part because it makes it look like they're putting all this stuff constantly on sale.
1415964	1423689	But all it is, they have the daily sales, and the votes and the flash sales are just the same things as the daily sales, just cycling through at random.
1423729	1432956	So yeah, if the thing that you voted on for the community sale didn't win, it's probably going to be a part of the daily sale the next day or the day after, or it'll be one of the flash sales at the bottom.
1433016	1434197	So you're going to get...
1434897	1438040	Well, remember that for Christmas because it's too late now.
1438280	1441463	Because remember when Civ V, I think, was like, what, eight bucks?
1441503	1443545	And people were like, fuck, I missed Civ V for eight bucks.
1443585	1446827	It's been eight bucks like three separate times since that you said that.
1446887	1447208	Yeah, yeah.
1447248	1449990	So they keep bringing those prices back and making us think they're unique.
1450570	1450951	Mm-hmm.
1452705	1456527	All right, so I think we've talked enough about our Steam addiction this week and the stuff we've bought.
1456908	1459889	Let's get into a similar topic because it's how we always start the show.
1460310	1462571	How was your gaming week?
1463231	1465653	Because the Steam sale is just about buying a bunch of games.
1465673	1466733	It doesn't mean you're going to play them.
1467094	1469095	So what did you actually play this week?
1469155	1470816	How was your gaming week?
1471116	1473357	Sorry, I have to make one more purchase here real quick.
1473397	1474398	Oh, God, what happened?
1474438	1475159	Just Cause 2 is $3.74.
1475199	1476059	That game is fucking awesome.
1480482	1480862	for $3.74.
1481083	1481983	I have to buy that.
1482123	1483144	Feed Gabe Newell.
1483184	1483765	Feed him.
1483805	1484706	I can't stop.
1486587	1495875	What am I... See, like, before, like, was it the stupid indie... I blame the humble indie bundles because, goddammit, I didn't have, you know, Steam and all this shit before that and now...
1497782	1505624	And now I'm sucked into this... Alright, well I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but I am going to say pause for a minute and tell us about your gaming week first.
1506584	1523729	So, this week I played Borderlands, because I picked it up on the same sale on PC, so I've been kind of going back and replaying that again since I want to kind of remember a little bit of what happens for the sequel, so that I can bust that out when it comes out in September.
1524589	1524729	And...
1526949	1527349	It's fun.
1527549	1527929	I like it.
1528049	1530330	And of course, I went ahead and modded it again.
1530550	1537572	It's been a while since I've actually played that game, so they've patched it a few more times and you can't do some of the really cool guns that you had before.
1537892	1543273	But there's still some pretty awesome ones in there that you can mod.
1543673	1544633	So I have some of those.
1544693	1547114	I have a pistol now that takes people's heads off and stuff.
1547734	1549476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1563092	1563833	Super Mario World World Select
1585593	1599800	and I don't like the fact that you can't stop moving in that because it's you know you push left to right and your guy just keeps walking and there's a spot where you have to kind of sit still before you know you do something um so it's a little annoying but I'm sure it's on like that on purpose
1601215	1604458	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
1620233	1622335	My class that I'm going to be using for the tournament.
1623296	1629222	Like I mentioned last week, I'm going to be entering a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 tournament almost a week from today.
1629442	1631504	It's next Saturday.
1631944	1632885	I'm looking forward to that.
1633266	1633986	That'll be kind of fun.
1634046	1635288	Driving down to Stockton.
1636397	1637698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1659392	1661715	Thank you for watching!
1671860	1695248	I don't know, just, I think that was about, oh, I had been selling some stuff on eBay, and I guess I must have bought something on eBay not too long ago, because I had like $6 worth of, it was like $6.60 in eBay bucks that they have, you earn like, I don't remember what the ratio is, but you earn like free money, basically, so...
1696088	1696888	I was bored one day.
1696908	1699249	I'm like, okay, I never really spend these.
1699409	1703330	So I'm going to find something that's gaming related under $6.60.
1703430	1707532	I'm going to try to find the best value for my money.
1707792	1714614	And so I was searching around and I actually found a digital copy of Child of Eden for $6.
1715714	1718075	So I picked that up because that's a no-brainer.
1718475	1722356	So hopefully I'll get back to playing that on the 360 again.
1722376	1722436	And...
1726769	1727869	I think that's all I played this week.
1728590	1728870	Awesome.
1729390	1732331	I'll go next because I didn't play a lot of new games this week.
1732591	1734652	I think I talked about most of the stuff in the Steam sale.
1735592	1739214	I didn't play enough Dungeon Defenders to really review it yet, so I'll come back to that next week.
1739974	1746537	I did play a little bit of Civ V, Gods and Kings, but you have to really book out a chunk of time to play that game.
1747157	1751278	I started playing it, and I didn't really have a whole lot of time, and I was playing sloppy.
1751318	1755220	For some reason, I decided to go for a military victory, and I never do military victories.
1755981	1769677	and I was spreading myself too thin on all fronts so I was getting my butt kicked on like an easy level and I was like forget it stop delete I'll come back to this later so yeah didn't really get to do a whole lot there played a little bit of WoW
1770339	1775763	Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 online on PC, and I gotta admit, I'm a little disappointed.
1775903	1777364	I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.
1777584	1778605	You all know... Go ahead.
1779166	1780266	Say it double fold.
1780306	1781027	There's two reasons.
1781107	1785731	Well, one reason for me, two reasons for you on why it's shitty and why you're not gonna play it anymore.
1785951	1787172	Well, I don't know.
1787212	1791715	Like, I'm threatening not to play it anymore, but I think we all know somebody will be like, please come play with me.
1791955	1798400	and I'll be like okay but I'm just I'm really frustrated and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.
1799020	1810408	Origin and I hate to say this because I know people that work at Origin but it's not good like I'm sorry I can't I'm really frustrated with it and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.
1810468	1813090	I'm consistently having an origin and this whole
1813630	1813930	and DarkSakura.
1833802	1834363	Go in.
1834783	1836304	We can play our own separate matches.
1836384	1840988	We can do co-op with two public pugs that we let in through the public match.
1841408	1842048	That's fine.
1842128	1850654	But Origin, its network kernel, can only keep track of one IP with two sessions on it.
1850835	1853196	It can't do it for another IP with two sessions on it.
1853276	1859421	So when we try to play with our friends who are in the exact same setup as us, the third person could get on.
1859581	1861983	But when the fourth person tries, they time out.
1862743	1868110	or if the match is already in progress, it will time out the person at their house while the fourth person tries to get in.
1868130	1869412	I know this makes no sense at this point.
1869732	1873016	But yeah, TLDR, it's shitty.
1873958	1876881	It's shitty and it's peer-to-peer, which is why it has this problem.
1877022	1879565	XBLA and I think PSN is all server-based.
1880806	1905134	so the matching service on Mass Effect 3 is peer-to-peer and that's why it has all these problems and let me tell you what I've had to put up with to play what is otherwise a great game again I don't get into online shooter games ever but Mass Effect 3 which isn't really a shooter but it kind of is like it has defied that trend but what I have to do to play this fucking game on Origin log into the game wait while it connects to Origin
1906132	1908233	Okay, game is connected to Origin.
1908273	1909053	Now the menu's up.
1909273	1915015	Wait while it loads my Galacticness Ready readiness rating or whatever it's called.
1915335	1917135	Okay, now select multiplayer.
1917495	1919176	Wait for multiplayer to load.
1919436	1920676	All right, let me connect to my friend.
1920996	1922277	Wait to connect to the friend.
1922397	1925297	It takes like four minutes to get into a freaking match.
1925397	1933180	I bet what it's doing for those first two big lags when it opens up the Galacticness Ready, I bet that's all like the DRM Origin security stuff going through.
1933420	1933960	It's gotta be.
1934620	1963239	which is ridiculous like it's stop like do it once do it once every 10 connections just stop bogging my game down because it's really ruining it for me and then what really just set me over the edge was that we played a game the other night it was me you and our friend Tim we were three manning some bronze maps which we can do to full extraction and we were playing those online we played two matches and I got about 30,000 credits I leveled one guy to from 19 to 20 and another my engineer from like one to six and
1963479	1964600	Yeah, lost all that.
1965621	1967722	After I disconnected from the match, lost it all.
1967902	1968362	Rolled back.
1969083	1970464	Wrote EA customer support.
1970564	1971925	Please give me back what I lost.
1972025	1972925	I got a reply back.
1972985	1974026	Sorry, can't do that.
1974887	1976148	No, you can do it.
1976228	1980590	You don't want to because you think I'm trying to, you know, get it from you or steal it from you.
1981091	1982832	This is ridiculous and I'm kind of over it.
1983052	1983272	Yeah.
1983632	1986714	Xbox has its share of connection problems too, honestly.
1986794	1993676	Because with Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, aside from the galactic readiness and the first player part of it, there's the challenge.
1994577	2001820	But then, aside from the challenge of shooting shit, you get credits and you buy these goody packs and you unlock new characters.
2001940	2004561	That's why people play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
2004601	2005901	It's because they want to play as a Vorcha.
2005921	2006982	They want to play as an Asari.
2007942	2037383	so if you're not getting your credits that's that's why you're playing is to buy unless you want to get Bioware points but which I refuse to do yeah so and then I have saved up for so many of these packs and then this gets into a little bit of like you know it's not fair the game's not fair I have yet I've unlocked two characters out of like the and the way you unlock stuff is ridiculous because it's all RNG you you buy a goodie box and then pray you get the shit you want in it and it's totally random and
2038706	2044109	So, Osfer says in our chatroom, just calm down and play the game on 360 after the show tonight.
2044149	2045910	We'll have a proper multiplayer game.
2045990	2048191	Yeah, I can play it on PC, you can play it on 360.
2048271	2057617	Maybe, I mean, I'm not saying no to like playing games on 360, but like all these issues, no matter what platform, I'm kind of like over Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and I'm ready for a new game.
2058237	2060498	And I'm ready for some single player content.
2060518	2062039	That's why we're going to play Borderlands.
2062920	2063200	Maybe.
2063420	2063680	Maybe.
2064020	2064320	Or Civ 5.
2064360	2064681	Maybe.
2065041	2065281	Maybe.
2065481	2079850	you realize Borderlands 2 you can play split screen on one Xbox 360 system and then also with that split screen play against other people we can do co-op and you can both play on the same TV
2082676	2083857	Come to the Borderlands 2.
2084558	2086299	I want to check out Borderlands 1 again.
2086359	2088640	I only played it a little bit before and got distracted.
2088680	2089701	So yeah, I'll definitely check that out.
2089721	2090421	It's fantastic.
2091322	2094464	So yeah, that's my little Origin rant.
2094744	2099067	It is setting EA as a company back.
2101028	2103289	But of course, EA is doing it to themselves.
2103570	2105351	So, you know, what can you do?
2105371	2107152	Sigh.
2107705	2110206	So, let's see.
2110306	2111466	I guess that's it for my gaming week.
2111486	2112106	I've ran it enough.
2112226	2112786	Alan, how about you?
2113967	2119128	Mass Effect 3, we already talked about that plenty, so I'm not going to get into that.
2120028	2120228	L.A.
2120268	2121748	Noire, which I've been playing.
2121768	2122809	I'm almost near the end.
2122949	2131151	I kind of want to beat it, not because it's boring, but I am using a FAQ so I can get everything the first time through and just follow the narrative of it.
2131411	2136532	And with the FAQ, that game's kind of boring, whereas other games, if you follow a FAQ, you still...
2137990	2141276	Have the mechanics of it keeping it fun.
2141597	2142699	So a shitload of L.A.
2142759	2143100	Noire.
2143601	2145264	Thanks to the Steam sale, it was dirt cheap.
2145604	2148871	So I got it for like 10, 12 bucks with it and all the DLC cases.
2149832	2150494	Enjoying that.
2152266	2154348	I was playing Saints Row the 3rd.
2154988	2159592	I'm on the mission where you parachute onto the top of the building and Kanye West is playing.
2161753	2163535	It's like an hour or so in.
2165756	2169619	Played a lot with the character creator in that.
2171521	2172802	You have that game on PC, right?
2173862	2176044	You might check Gentlemen of the Row.
2176404	2180948	They have a lot of cool enhancements and stuff for both Saints Row 2 and Saints Row the 3rd.
2181368	2182208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2201814	2229305	I installed a game that I hadn't played in a couple years Postal 2 for anyone who remembers that it's actually it's a really it's incredibly vulgar and offensive in a lot of ways but it's a first person shooter it's you know dated seven days of the week I got the expansion so I was playing Postal 2 for some reason I'm like I just want to play a really offensive awful first person shooter I think oh um
2230856	2232457	I guess I'll make this a part of my gaming week.
2233038	2244705	I decided to check out my PSP, my Slim, which has got custom firmware on it, just to see if there are any custom firmware updates up to date, maybe check out some of the UMDs I have.
2245286	2258815	And I noticed when I turned it on that there's this weird spotting discoloration splotches around the border of my screen, and I googled it, and it turns out this is a known issue for older PSPs.
2259535	2260455	We don't live here.
2260716	2262896	In Sacramento, it's like 102 degrees outside right now.
2263016	2268058	I don't live in San Bruno anymore where it's foggy, but this is a known issue.
2268358	2273220	There's mold under my LCD between the glass and the backlit portion.
2274920	2276481	It's just a slight discoloration.
2276521	2280662	If Jamie was here, I'd have her take a picture of it and put it on the Flickr stream.
2281659	2302816	I saw someone else but I guess yeah this is a thing you get mold under your it's when I'm actually playing when I'm actually playing like a bright game like crap of the rapper really any game it's the the colors and the movement doesn't really notice I don't really notice that much but on like just the crossbar the menu screen I'm like this sucks
2303556	2316146	I don't know if it's mold, though, because it's almost like just the LCD screen just kind of going out or something, because you can see if you turn it, it changes the colors and stuff of it.
2316266	2316546	It looks...
2316934	2320015	and it's, ooh, it's all splotchy.
2320295	2320595	Yeah.
2320655	2321215	Gross.
2321355	2322295	Looks like a disease.
2322355	2324175	It looks like your PSP has shingles.
2324255	2325136	I'm going to put it down.
2325576	2326296	I don't want to get it.
2326396	2334898	So yeah, I've heard people say like, not that this is a fix for it, but someone, I was reading a forum post and someone was like, what if you put it under a UV light for like a day?
2334938	2337858	Will the UV light kill the fungus under there?
2337878	2339198	And I'm like, I'm not doing that.
2339719	2346080	But yeah, it's, if you have a PSP and it's been in your closet for a year because you don't play PSP anymore, turn it on and see if it's got,
2348068	2349629	Weird splotches under it.
2350409	2354311	I got 2000, haven't really powered it on in a long time.
2355071	2356011	So, yeah.
2357432	2358632	My PSP has crud.
2359192	2359472	Wow.
2359753	2360593	It needs antibiotics.
2361213	2363714	You could just get a new screen if you wanted.
2365795	2368618	Alright, well, it's not like you leave that thing in the bathroom.
2369218	2373322	You know, like in the bathroom you might expect it to get moldy because you know the steam from the shower and all that.
2373342	2374923	It's been in the living room on our shelf.
2375243	2376124	Yeah, that's weird.
2376204	2378186	And when I last turned this on... It's dry here.
2378226	2379126	It's not even humid.
2379166	2382289	I think I turned this on last around Christmas and it was fine.
2382409	2384131	So it's something that's happened within the last six months.
2384151	2385472	I'm worried about my PSP now.
2385512	2387273	Yeah, because it's been years for yours.
2387473	2392658	And we need to turn on the Vita every couple... You're still watching Netflix on the Vita, right?
2393078	2393258	Yeah.
2393439	2394721	All right, good.
2395582	2395882	All right.
2397024	2400429	Well, if that's it for your gaming week, let me get into housekeeping real quick and then we'll get into the news.
2400810	2402172	Some quick housekeeping tonight.
2403854	2408762	First off, the Summerfest for PlayStation Home is next week.
2409182	2423607	You can read more about that at the VOG Network's website, vognetwork.com, but we will be live in PlayStation Home, kind of being there exploring in the Aurora space and meeting some people virtually as well as broadcasting at the same time.
2424588	2429689	Don't worry though if you don't even have a PlayStation 3, nothing's going to change for you.
2429809	2433691	You just, you know, you won't be able to participate in going into home, but you're not going to miss anything.
2433711	2436252	We're still broadcasting the way we always do and all that.
2436292	2437152	It's just kind of like we'll have a
2437852	2450319	and some listeners that want to come into the home space.
2450519	2451259	So it's a lot of fun.
2452040	2456222	Again, that's happening in the Aurora space during next week's Bobby Blackwolf show and our show.
2456542	2461425	For more information, there's a story right in the feature bar at vognetwork.com.
2463365	2466526	Also, please don't forget to add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2467226	2470027	And we are also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2470407	2471487	We have a giveaway tonight.
2471527	2479489	We're going to do a giveaway in part B. And tonight we are giving away, thanks to one of our listeners, and I really appreciate it, Boshka.
2479849	2481429	One of our listeners is giving this away.
2481949	2484390	And you can tune in to his blog.
2484410	2486250	I believe it's CritCraft is what it's called.
2486290	2487190	I'm going off the top of my head.
2487530	2490391	So I want to credit his blog for providing this.
2490891	2494593	It is a beta key for Ravaged.
2495053	2498215	Ravaged was a Kickstarter funded project and it's now in beta.
2498315	2499976	All you need is you need Steam.
2500476	2506639	So we're going to give this away to a random listener in part B. If you want to win this, you have to be in our chat room and
2507279	2507860	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2526978	2527618	I think that's it.
2527638	2530699	I feel like I'm forgetting something, but if I think of it, I'll come back to it later.
2530799	2532820	So let's get started with tonight's news in the meantime.
2532940	2533200	Loki.
2533720	2543063	So I'm sure this is going to come to a shock to a lot of people, but there's a rumor that Final Fantasy XIII Versus is dead.
2544343	2544583	I know.
2544824	2552406	Shocking that, you know, a game that we haven't seen much of for six years not coming out.
2553226	2574960	but uh yeah and this is coming from some inside sources um that apparently Kotaku is talking to and they're saying that you know it's officially canceled but I mean I don't know if it's officially canceled or if it's just gonna be retitled they haven't made a statement right there's no been no PR bulletin or anything okay
2575851	2577914	Yeah, it's the last thing I think.
2578695	2585043	We're almost done with preparing our latest info for the game because of a totally unrelated reason.
2585083	2588327	There are circumstances in which that info cannot be released.
2589764	2607754	so info for that game maybe it's now no longer versus because honestly 13 versus it still didn't make any sense to me why it's called that because both games you know it looks nothing like Final Fantasy 13 at all and there's nothing so far that they've shown us that's led me to believe that's even in the same universe as 13
2608334	2610556	I think some of the mythology is supposed to be the same.
2610716	2615721	Like the whole LaCie and the Falsie and all that I think is supposed to be like a constant.
2615821	2619865	I want to say it was a trilogy but there was the main story and then the two guidance side stories.
2619945	2621867	One for the PSP and then Versus 13.
2622147	2626692	Yeah, there's supposed to be some common thread no matter regardless of how thin tying it all together.
2626892	2636215	Final Fantasy Agito, or whatever it was called, excuse me if I'm butchering that name, it just became Final Fantasy Type-0, so why wouldn't Final Fantasy XIII Versus just become something else?
2636695	2644698	Which folks are speculating, including me on this show a couple months ago, I think I said, why don't they just make it Final Fantasy XV at this point?
2645058	2654862	It would make a lot of sense, because we're starting to get into the next cycle of consoles, yet we're supposed to get, I mean, you know, again, Square can do whatever they want, but historically there has always been
2655322	2657585	Three Final Fantasy games on every console.
2657645	2658045	Think about it.
2658325	2661489	1 through 3 was on the NES, even though 2 and 3 didn't come out here in America.
2662250	2666875	4, 5, and 6 was on the Super Nintendo, even though 5 didn't come out in North America, but it did later.
2666895	2667956	7, 8, and 9, PlayStation 1.
2667996	2668516	10, 11, 12, PlayStation 2.
2668556	2668516	13, 14...
2674700	2702287	13.2 13.2, yeah and technically 14 isn't out on consoles yet, although it's still slated it'll eventually come out, I mean 14 or we should say 11.2 because it's basically the 11 characters with their names changed so they could very well, instead of saying Falsie and Lussie or whatever, they could be like they're the we're just going to go back to Espers they're Espers now, or they're Summons, or they're I don't know
2702987	2704789	Let's make up another name for summons.
2704829	2707291	Well, they could just... It's Final Fantasy blank.
2707311	2708492	They could think of a name for it.
2708532	2710274	You know, just like there was Final Fantasy Tactics.
2710334	2712796	It wasn't really a Final Fantasy game, but kind of in that universe.
2712816	2713437	Or Dui Decium.
2713557	2713977	It was a great game.
2713997	2715258	What the fuck was that kind of a name?
2715358	2716159	So, I don't know.
2716619	2726108	And you can't count 13-2 really as a game in the... I mean, because then you'd have to count 10-2, and then you'd have to count Dirge of Cerberus, and it throws everything off.
2726228	2727569	So, you can't do that.
2727589	2728150	Yeah.
2729491	2730271	Those are all spin-offs.
2730832	2734113	But I guess we're going to have a definitive answer come, what, September 1st?
2734133	2737074	Because there's supposed to be some... Probably a Tokyo Game Show, at least by then.
2737575	2739836	Well, Square's doing some type of Final Fantasy.
2740056	2745478	Like they even said, what is next in the Final Fantasy XIII universe on September 1st?
2745778	2752061	And so either that's Versus has a new name or it's...
2752978	2756623	or all of this is proven false because, again, it is a rumor.
2757464	2761489	I mean, you know, it's not like everything Kotaku's ever said has turned out to be true.
2761650	2762751	Think about it.
2764113	2769099	And there's also a possibility, and a lot of people are saying, well, what else could they do but Final Fantasy XIII 3?
2772386	2773407	Wouldn't that be something?
2774668	2783135	Which is weird because... If it's true that there's a Final Fantasy XIII 3, which would make a lot of sense.
2783295	2784976	I think XIII 2 did pretty good.
2785016	2788599	It probably wasn't as expensive to make because they made it on the same engine.
2788899	2791701	They had all that DLC for it, which I'm sure made them money too.
2792042	2794924	XIII 3 actually makes a lot of sense for them to do.
2795284	2796605	But it's weird because...
2797833	2813500	Final Fantasy XIII was supposed to be three separate games and now Final Fantasy XIII might if these theories prove to end up being three games that are all just 1, 2, 3 Final Fantasy XIII, 1, 2, 3 It's kind of weird how it transformed like that
2818145	2834889	And I think the reason why a lot of people are invested in this story is for those who don't follow Square Enix that closely, the crew that, like the director and the main crew who did the Kingdom Hearts console games have been working on 13 versus 13 for however, five, six years.
2835390	2839731	So for it to become vaporware maybe would piss a lot of people off because...
2841371	2857342	depending on how tinfoil hat you want to get the Kingdom Hearts console team has been working on it so they need to have a product out so they can work on the next Kingdom Hearts I just can't see Square just throwing it away I could see where Square has decided Kingdom Hearts 3 needs to happen now
2857862	2860543	and so maybe they've said, you know what guys?
2860863	2869948	You've had this game for too effing long so we're taking it away from you and giving it to this other team and we're going to put it out under a new name and you guys go work on Kingdom Hearts 3.
2870488	2872409	I mean, anything is possible in that regard.
2873129	2874750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2893686	2894567	They're not beyond throwing.
2895027	2899550	Although some things that they should really throw out, 14, they just don't and they hold on to.
2899570	2900251	And that's the other thing.
2900331	2907436	Maybe they're realizing they need to rush 15 because they need to erase 14, basically.
2907916	2909077	Which is still getting relaunched.
2909477	2926790	Well, I also saw speculation that the reason why there's no press release saying yes versus 13, this is what's happened to it, whether it be canceled or whatever, is because their last year fiscally was so bad because of 14 shedding the bed that they're just not putting out negative press releases anymore because of damage control from 14.
2927391	2928511	But that's kind of, I don't...
2929830	2930691	That's a thought.
2931652	2933374	I don't want to drag this out too long, much longer.
2933394	2948690	I want to get to the next story, but I do want to kind of throw this idea out there because somebody on Facebook had said this and I was like, hmm, that's a good point, is that, well, if they canceled Final Fantasy XIII Versus, why did they just release the theme song for Theatrhythm?
2949651	2952613	because Theatrhythm has that song as a downloadable song.
2953073	2959217	So why would they release that if they just canceled the game and teased this Final Fantasy XIII versus?
2959957	2962879	Of course, this could be the case of Square Enix being a giant company.
2963159	2969543	The left hand hasn't told the right hand Theatrhythm DLC team what's going on, but I thought it was an interesting point.
2971804	2972044	All right.
2973325	2975066	Let's move on to another story.
2976167	2976587	Avatar Famestars
2991242	3003266	Now, a trademark for the game had turned up earlier in the year, but now we're starting to see this actually appear in games, such as Wreck-A-Tier, not to be confused with the game that's on Steam.
3003667	3006528	This is Wreck, like Wreck-It Ralph, Wreck-A-Tier.
3007388	3013930	It is part of Microsoft's Summer of Arcade series, and it is including this Avatar Famestars.
3014130	3014691	What is this?
3014831	3015111	Quote,
3015891	3028701	Avatar Fame Stars is a new program from Microsoft Studios and is part of a select group of games that delivers new and exciting ways to play online with your friends and compete for social recognition, according to Microsoft.
3029521	3040670	I guess this is supposed to include in-game challenges, and this sounds like kind of like rebranding of shit that's already been there, because if you do these challenges...
3041170	3042471	or I thought Achievements.
3043011	3048615	In these Avatar Fame Star games, you get rewards based on your Fame Star points.
3049175	3050696	Oh, so like rewards for my Avatar.
3050956	3053038	Doesn't that technology already exist on the 360?
3053738	3057500	Like I could swear that if you play like Super Meat Boy, you get a T-shirt.
3057680	3058621	Or Minecraft.
3058881	3060702	And there's tons of that type of stuff in games.
3061102	3062884	So I'm trying to figure out like what is this?
3063624	3069409	But I guess what they're doing is instead of it being game by game by game, this is one gigantic pool.
3069970	3078858	So if a game is participating in this pool, then you get the points and the achievement points towards a common unlock.
3078998	3082381	That's the difference, which is a little weird, but that's how it works.
3082881	3087746	So the rewards cross from game to game, as does the points total.
3088266	3091828	Avatar Famestars is locked to your Xbox 360.
3092288	3098872	They're saying it's possible this is something that could spill over to Windows 8, Surface tablets, Windows phones.
3099292	3099773	Who knows?
3099973	3107337	Other games that will include Avatar Famestars support, Full House Poker, World of Kieflings, so games that already exist.
3107397	3108778	It's going to be kind of patched in.
3109218	3113601	Fire Pro Wrestling, Home Run Stars, Avatar Motocross Madness.
3114321	3123797	we don't know when the already existing games will have it patched in or when all these other games are coming out but I guess if you're into collecting avatar awards there you go
3126570	3152292	I don't know about you guys, but pretty much every avatar on my friends list is all wearing Mass Effect carb Not me though, I actually tried to make my avatar look like me I was a sucker and I spent like 120 Microsoft points to get a stupid hat for my avatar that looks like a hat I would wear out to a club Because I am a sucker Anyhow, let's move on with some more news
3154201	3158604	So Valve is always trying to do great and interesting things with Steam.
3158684	3161847	It's a gaming store and application.
3162667	3171894	They brought Steam to Mac and Apple platforms, and they also invented Steam Play, which is where if you buy a license for one game on PC, you get it for Mac and vice versa.
3171995	3173616	And now they're bringing Steam to Linux.
3175137	3176298	So there's going to be a Steam client.
3176738	3182841	For Linux, they are using the Ubuntu distribution.
3182921	3191704	And for people who aren't familiar with Linux, there's different revisions of it based on which company wrote that build of it.
3191724	3194925	And there's Red Hat and Corel and Ubuntu.
3196006	3201148	So yeah, that's what they're going for because it's sort of the popular make of it right now.
3201728	3212255	The first game that they're porting to their first party title that they're bringing to Steam Linux is Left 4 Dead 2.
3212835	3214897	They've been working on it since last year, 2011.
3217913	3221015	There will be an internal beta of Steam on Ubuntu in the near future.
3221655	3223616	They've announced that it is coming soon.
3225936	3227877	Left 4 Dead 2 is the first title they're bringing to it.
3228638	3234540	If other developers want to port their games over to Linux, Valve is making the distribution model for it.
3234740	3236421	You ran a Linux box for a while, didn't you?
3237641	3238281	Kind of, yeah.
3238321	3239502	I had a FreeBSD box.
3240462	3244584	That was a long time ago, back when I was trying to host my own domain name and be a super nerd.
3245535	3246495	Let me ask this question.
3246515	3248397	I'm going to take it back a huge step here.
3248517	3252001	I want to ask this question because I seriously think a lot of people don't know the answer to this.
3252041	3259608	And I think sometimes the hardcore computer people, super nerds, don't realize that a lot of people don't get this.
3259708	3260328	Or maybe they do.
3260429	3260749	I don't know.
3261129	3265013	But why would someone want to have a Linux machine?
3265353	3267674	What does Linux do for you that Windows doesn't?
3267934	3268374	Uptime.
3269355	3272336	A well-made Linux install.
3272936	3275417	You just have your computer on all the time.
3275697	3276718	You don't lose any performance.
3279419	3294525	You can put... The terminology, I haven't touched this stuff in seriously like 10 years, but when people think Linux or Unix, they think of sort of like MS-DOS prompt, like just a text terminal, but that's not the case.
3295325	3299952	Linux has visual Windows-ish interfaces now.
3300653	3309265	So, but if you're into independent software, like really independent, Linux has got a huge community, people making apps for each other.
3309485	3309846	I don't know.
3309906	3310867	It's just all about the...
3312814	3324577	If you do have a good internet connection, you want to host your own email, host your own domain names, host your own web server, blah, blah, blah, you're going to be running some flavor of Linux on that box if you want to do all that in-house.
3325437	3328418	Look at all these nerds in our chat room, and I say that lovingly.
3328918	3332318	Blackwolf says, I've had a free BSD server up for over 1,000 days.
3334859	3335200	Up time.
3335420	3335740	Up time.
3335920	3339404	My home box was up for 400 days until I rebooted it recently.
3340084	3344188	TigerClaw says Linux is commonly used to run servers, especially for online games.
3344608	3347851	GameGuru says Linux is generally more secure than Windows.
3348412	3350254	Is that, though, because just less people use it?
3350314	3357481	Like, it's kind of like the whole, well, Apple never gets hacked because there's less people on, you know, those systems than there are on...
3358081	3366865	Well, there was a problem in the early 2000s where certain distributions of Linux, if you just put it on a machine, would have its email relay turned on by default.
3366985	3372168	So if someone found your IP address, they could just spam the shit out of everybody using your server and you would never know.
3372848	3379351	So if you don't know what you're doing, people can do nasty things on your Linux box.
3379451	3380912	But then that's your problem.
3380932	3384594	It's you being an idiot, not the software being, you know, built...
3385614	3387395	Well, Technus says, I like Linux.
3387555	3389496	I hate the elitist community that comes with it.
3390877	3391097	Yeah.
3392838	3400282	FreeBSD versus Linux, or just the StarBSD versus StarLinux, that's some Star Wars, Star Trek shit.
3400382	3404244	There's switchblades, and people get shivved in alleyways.
3404564	3405305	It's very brutal.
3407190	3410272	So Steam on Linux, do you think that would be well received by the community?
3410512	3412614	Or do you think it'll be like, ugh, commercialism?
3412854	3424922	Well, they would have to run, if they really wanted to play Windows games on Linux, they would have to do, I think, it's called Wine, which is kind of like, I think, Boot Camp.
3424942	3427324	A lot of people on the internet wine very well.
3427384	3427504	Yeah.
3428384	3451877	it's like boot camper parallels I think on Mac where you can run Windows through it so if people wanted to play PC games but they just I don't want a PC box in my house I don't want a partition of a hard drive god damn it this will allow them to do that for at least for Left 4 Dead 2 anything else if they don't want to have a Windows box or a Windows partition they're going to have to mess with it
3453807	3456628	BlackWolf says very clearly, Wine is not an emulator.
3456788	3459328	It basically implements the Windows DLLs on Linux.
3460609	3462129	It's a little correction.
3462309	3464669	Because remember, Linux, elitist.
3464810	3465270	Right, Bobby?
3466090	3466890	I'm giving him a hard time.
3468930	3470931	GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 is a good choice.
3470991	3472391	It's a rather complex source game.
3472591	3472951	That's true.
3472991	3475892	If you can get that on there, then that opens the door to a lot of other games.
3476292	3483519	All right, before we go on to the next story, Loki, I want to... Wine actually stands for wine is not an emulator.
3483680	3486042	I think I actually knew that, but I'm so far removed.
3486062	3487564	Ten years, just saying old age.
3487724	3487864	Yeah.
3487884	3488384	All right.
3488985	3494611	I want to go back to a comment that came up in chat earlier, because this is a very important clarification to something I brought up a minute ago.
3495331	3523970	Osfer in our chatroom says for the Theatrhythm DLC for Somnus from Final Fantasy Versus XIII it labels the song as just from the Final Fantasy series but not which one maybe that's a sign of the name change that they don't want to reveal yet that is huge that is a big deal I think that's worth stating so thank you for saying that Osfer I think that is if they didn't label it as Versus XIII then yes a name change is coming or question mark question mark
3524454	3525154	I think you're right.
3526254	3526855	Very interesting.
3526915	3528075	Alright, back to news.
3528115	3528535	Sorry, Loki.
3528835	3534597	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Fez.
3534697	3546620	Fez had an issue with one of its recent patches where not a lot of people, but some people were having issues with their save games being obliterated.
3548362	3559513	and, of course, because of that, Polytron pulled back the patch that they put out and they were going to release a second patch to fix that problem.
3560054	3568162	However, they said no because it was going to cost them $10,000 to get the game recertified by Microsoft.
3569223	3581533	And, um, so they're just saying, well, you know, if any players have an issue with the game, um, you know, your saves being deleted since you're only like 1%, um, kind of tough luck.
3581593	3582794	You just got to deal with it.
3583654	3592181	Um, so of course, you know, they made the comment, you know, had Fez been released on Steam, we wouldn't have this issue because updates are free.
3594110	3597813	But I believe the designer of Fez said it's not a PC game.
3598514	3599674	Didn't want it on PCs.
3600275	3600735	Exactly.
3602156	3603818	And then they said no.
3604018	3606240	Well, does that mean a Steam version is in progress?
3606340	3611224	Only a few months left for Xbox Live Arcade exclusivity, they said.
3612104	3621728	Microsoft, of course, responded saying that Polytron and their investors, Trapdoor, made the decision not to work on an additional title update for Fez.
3622208	3631992	Microsoft Studios chose to support this decision based on the belief that Polytron and Trapdoor were in the best position to determine what the acceptable quality level for their game is.
3632953	3641980	And while we do not disclose the cost of title updates, we did offer to work with Trapdoor and make sure that wasn't a blocking issue.
3642261	3644383	We were mainly huge fans of Fez.
3645864	3650928	So, I don't know if that means, okay, we're not going to charge you $10,000, but we'll charge you $7,500.
3651048	3653130	Discount!
3653611	3654151	Discount.
3654251	3655893	I mean, I don't really know what the issue is.
3655913	3658515	Apparently Microsoft patches are available in the Steam sale.
3660339	3661580	But here's my thing.
3664081	3668203	First off, it is a closed system, so Microsoft can charge you wherever the hell you want.
3668483	3672885	But when you make your game, you're well aware of what those costs are going to be before you make your game.
3673486	3675247	And they probably thought, okay, well, that's no problem.
3675267	3677228	We're not going to have an issue with this stuff.
3677248	3682130	But then some bugs went through, and so they released a patch, which obviously they did not test well enough.
3682430	3688954	And if it's only happening to 1% of the people all the time... See, I don't understand how a save game problem can only be happening to 1% of the people because...
3689834	3714135	that's you're basically running on systems that are all the same you know I don't understand how it can affect one and not the other but whatever so they released a patch that they didn't test well enough and now they're complaining that they would have to pay more money out of their pocket to you know fix the game and I understand this developer is not as big as like Activision who releases like 13 goddamn patches for Call of Duty and
3715109	3717313	Indie Game, The Movie, Surely They Must Be Rich
3726934	3731295	Well, I don't know if that's the case, but maybe $10,000 is too much.
3731415	3733195	Maybe they're kind of like opportunity costs.
3733215	3744218	We can either fix it for the 1%, but are we really going to recoup this money in additional sales, or do we just leave it as it is, and hopefully it doesn't affect that many more people, and we'll just keep the money where we're at.
3744258	3747078	I think that's kind of where they're at, is that they want to spend the money.
3747218	3756140	It's a tricky issue, though, because on one hand, I'm like, wow, that's kind of fucked up of Microsoft to charge so much money, but on the other hand, I'm like, well, it also really encourages people to get it right the first time, so I can't blame them.
3756440	3785281	because as it is games are patched left and right anyways and you know I think that it's a good thing that they do charge that kind of money because it does discourage them from like going well fuck it we didn't really test this game so we're just gonna release it out there we'll see what kind of bugs people run into and then we'll go fix it I should be able to get a refund when their game is buggy as hell although it's not granted it's only affecting less than one or whatever it is one percent of people but if I'm in that one percent I should be able to get my money back don't you think
3787526	3797987	You'd have to make the argument with Microsoft Welcome to the world of digital distribution Yeah They just take customer service right on out of the picture
3798602	3804926	But to be fair, it's not necessarily Microsoft's fault that that game doesn't work.
3805446	3806726	It's just being hosted on their service.
3806807	3811129	It's the developer and publisher that decided, hey, we don't want to pay money to fix this game.
3811209	3813990	So you're going to have to go ask them for your money back.
3814090	3815751	Yeah, but it's on their system.
3815871	3817032	It's only on their system.
3817132	3819874	They kind of own it a little bit too.
3819994	3820974	I mean, whether they want it or not.
3820994	3821895	It's not their fault though.
3822275	3822575	I know.
3822875	3827458	That's like saying, oh, that game is like –
3828398	3835142	This game is buggy, and just because it happens to be on Xbox 360, I'm going to blame Microsoft for it.
3835682	3838884	It doesn't make any sense, because they're just providing the system that it runs on.
3838944	3840545	Their system's not causing the problem.
3841826	3843047	At least, I don't think it is.
3844153	3859600	Alright, well let's move on to a different topic that apparently is causing a big problem in the iPad world, or iOS, but this particularly is for the iPad, and Alan, I'm pretty happy that Maruko in San Rio, your cats...
3860040	3860480	DarkSakura.com
3879716	3884997	Yeah, I'm incredibly against decline cats because they actually remove like it's part of the bone.
3885197	3885417	Yeah.
3885657	3887118	So you're taking off like half their finger.
3887178	3888238	So I think that's wrong.
3888698	3892819	But if you don't have a declawed cat, why is it pining your iPad?
3893159	3894200	It costs like $800.
3894720	3895640	What is wrong with you?
3895660	3898621	I don't think the glass scratches that easy from cats scratching it.
3898641	3903462	I mean, like my cat scratches our LCD TV and... I wouldn't want to take that chance.
3904002	3906805	Because I look at the sofa and I'm like... Well, that's the sofa.
3906845	3911089	That's where you've got material where the cat's claws are getting caught in.
3911369	3912891	The cats have already fucked up the bed.
3912911	3914452	Yeah, but we're talking glass.
3914472	3918837	We're talking glass that's meant to withstand quite a few scuffs.
3919517	3928546	Obviously, dropping it on something or scraping it against something sharp might cause a scratch, but the cat claws aren't strong enough to cause a lot of scratches.
3928646	3933628	And there's folks in the chat saying Bobby Blackwolf says their claws don't scratch the screen.
3933668	3934068	They've tested.
3934088	3935229	Plus, I hear that.
3935389	3936929	I just don't believe it.
3936969	3939711	Plus, the bottom of their feet are nice and soft.
3939751	3942852	So whatever scratches they put in there, they buff right out.
3942992	3944332	So it's fine.
3944372	3948094	When a cat bats at something playfully, it doesn't have its claws out.
3948114	3954377	But when it's trying to fuck up a chair, it's trying to clean its claws on it.
3954397	3955457	So yes, its claws are out.
3955597	3957278	But it's not going to do that on an iPad.
3958621	3961603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3976154	3980337	It, like everything else in the Apple world these days, has DLC.
3980958	3982279	Double dippin', right?
3982319	3985441	Charge you up front and then, hey, you want more levels for your cats?
3986282	3988564	99 cents for a new mouse level.
3988884	3989684	What a surprise.
3990125	3991506	But here's the real surprise.
3993507	3994508	Cats bought it.
3995709	4001713	Apparently, there's this epidemic where cats are inadvertently buying the DLC.
4002874	4004535	And people are complaining...
4005578	4010382	That the design of the game fooled cats into buying it on purpose.
4011483	4015887	Yeah, because there's probably some little mouse that says buy more on it that runs across the screen.
4016587	4019249	And then the next one is yes to check out.
4019470	4020010	And that's it.
4021571	4024674	You know, real hard stuff to code around.
4024694	4030039	You know, I thought that they had to put in passwords in order to, you know, get that stuff purchased.
4030079	4031461	You can save those, apparently.
4032121	4033983	Because I can't do that on my iPod.
4034023	4034764	I have to, you know.
4034784	4037186	No, you can save your password so it never prompts you for that stuff.
4037486	4037887	DarkSakura.com
4052523	4054444	We let our cats watch the TV.
4054944	4057225	Why is it stupid?
4057245	4060426	That's like, okay, this is basically like saying, hey, you know what?
4060466	4061546	My cat likes the outdoors.
4061566	4065207	I'm going to buy it a car so it can drive down the street because it fucking likes the outdoors.
4065227	4066128	Tootsies is real.
4068368	4077111	I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that I can see someone having a little swipe, you know, a little game visually for the cat on an iPad.
4077151	4077712	That's fine.
4077792	4078652	I can believe that.
4079032	4080993	What I can't believe is someone going, hmm...
4082473	4086077	Mittens was really into that game a week ago, but now she just doesn't care.
4086137	4087518	I think she needs the DLC.
4087718	4092103	I think she needs a new stage for her to be interested in again.
4092183	4094205	Yeah, no, cats don't give a shit.
4095897	4096978	and DarkSakura.com
4119435	4121016	and they're like, I gotta get that light.
4121096	4121997	I gotta get the light.
4122017	4122877	The light's delicious.
4122957	4123478	Eat the light.
4123558	4123798	Light.
4123958	4124178	Light.
4124599	4125239	Chase the light.
4126380	4126600	Light.
4126880	4127480	I'm gonna get it.
4127801	4128221	The light.
4128581	4128801	Light.
4129502	4129802	I got it.
4129982	4130202	I got it.
4130242	4130623	Oh, damn it.
4130643	4131103	It's on my paw.
4131563	4131763	Got it.
4131923	4132844	Oh, so close.
4133384	4133605	Got it.
4134165	4134345	Light.
4134485	4134625	Light.
4134705	4135026	Where'd it go?
4135106	4135446	Where'd it go?
4135486	4135786	Where'd it go?
4135826	4136106	Where'd it go?
4136146	4136406	Where'd it go?
4137367	4139330	That can also be a dog too, by the way.
4140151	4140652	Dogs do that.
4141733	4147261	I used to love that because I'd play with the laser pointer on my dog and you'd see her just like twitching out for like an hour afterwards.
4147281	4150826	Just like, what, what, what, what, what?
4150846	4151747	They're coming for me.
4151767	4152388	Wait, wait.
4155909	4159850	To answer the folks in chat, Hiccup is the company behind this game.
4160370	4168453	And an artist named TJ Fuller, who did the artwork in Games for Cats, said, quote, We got in a lot of trouble.
4173181	4178085	So, they have implemented a human check to fix the issue.
4178666	4184510	You have to hold four fingers on touch points without moving them for a few seconds.
4185131	4190575	Because a cat would never have that type of attention span to hold in four spots for a few seconds.
4190635	4195239	Unless it's standing on top of the iPad.
4195439	4195699	Okay.
4198095	4204297	So just like you have to monitor your children when they're playing with the iPad, maybe you should monitor your cat.
4204977	4211839	Because let's be real, you're not buying the app on the iPad for the cat's enjoyment, you're buying it for yours to watch the cat play it.
4212559	4215520	Get the cat away from you so they would stop bothering you.
4219886	4223748	Ranma in chat says, this all reminds me of the Smurfs village fiasco.
4223908	4225429	Yes, Ranma, but those were children.
4225469	4226269	This is a cat.
4226589	4227170	It doesn't matter.
4227210	4228730	They still have like 13-year-olds.
4228750	4232472	I didn't know that those Microsoft purchases were real money.
4232852	4233693	Right.
4233753	4234553	You didn't know that.
4235614	4236174	Sure.
4238455	4239795	Well, now you know.
4241985	4249468	What's the name of the really, he's really old, he's got the sunglasses, the fashion designer, Margaret Cho had a bit about him.
4250189	4251149	Carl Lagerfeld.
4251209	4251489	Yes.
4252450	4256291	His cat has a personal assistant and a Twitter and its own iPad.
4256812	4257752	So I just put that out there.
4258252	4260393	Carl Lagerfeld's cat has its own iPad.
4261013	4262734	So that maybe that could be, you know.
4262914	4264155	What have you done with your life?
4264175	4264355	Yeah.
4269679	4271561	So the story reminded me of that.
4271881	4272862	That's a real thing.
4273522	4275343	What would you put on your resume?
4275404	4277665	Yeah, I was a personal assistant to this cat.
4278486	4284190	That was my last... The cat fired me because I... Tunes is the driving cat.
4284611	4286712	The cat who can drive a car.
4287773	4290916	He drives around all over the town.
4291056	4292937	Tunes is the driving cat.
4294318	4297020	Tunes is the cat who can drive a car.
4298161	4298882	Don't just look at me!
4304266	4306068	Let's be real, though.
4306088	4309751	Two Exes did a good thing by making sure Victoria Jackson was in that car.
4311492	4311953	Agree.
4312553	4313574	And poor Phil Hartman.
4313874	4314635	Poor Phil Hartman.
4314675	4315235	Rest in peace.
4317677	4324763	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, kitten.
4326285	4327405	All right, let's move on.
4327586	4327806	Alan.
4331171	4332412	Excuse me, I'm eating popcorn.
4334912	4335493	What's going on?
4335653	4342195	Sony is shutting down the online servers for two of its MotorStorm Muddy Truck games.
4343215	4345656	Specifically, it's MotorStorm Pacific Rift.
4346637	4361833	which came out in 2008 so that is four years old and it's PSP counterpart MotorStorm Arctic Edge so if you like to connect to PSN and do races co-op or whatever with the matching service that is all going away.
4363001	4366482	as of, I think, October 1st is the last day.
4367043	4370644	Or I guess September 30th is the last day you have to enjoy that because October 1st is going down.
4370664	4371924	Well, at least I gave you a heads up.
4372104	4373045	Oh, that was nice then.
4373125	4376366	Are any of these games online pass games or are we not there yet?
4376386	4377186	No, we're not yet.
4377226	4378147	I didn't even get into it.
4378207	4384169	When I was bitching about Mass Effect 3, by the way, I didn't even get into the online pass thing and how my $10 isn't paying for shit.
4384209	4388010	But anyway, I'll just let that argument write itself, boys and girls.
4388030	4389171	I just wanted to throw that out there.
4391930	4393332	Yeah, it's a really short story.
4393733	4394634	That's really it.
4395055	4402126	Motorstorm Pacific Rift and Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is a PSP title, losing its Sony-provided network.
4402426	4405792	Well, the PSPs are molding over anyway, so that one's not so bad, you know.
4407904	4413490	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what games we can buy that will have their servers shut down in 2015.
4413550	4422499	Well, I don't know if any of these games are going to have their servers shut down, but there is not really much coming out this week because it's kind of falling along the lines of...
4423880	4426881	July, the month with no game releases.
4427161	4446728	But this week we do have, if you're feeling that you've got to get in shape to wear a bikini, maybe not this year because you've procrastinated too long, but for next year, they've got the Adidas MyCoach for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Move and Connect.
4446748	4448749	There's tons of pre-orders for that.
4449369	4450249	That's coming out this week.
4450609	4451269	Myst on 3DS.
4454171	4458515	because there's actually people that were born well after that game came out.
4459416	4463120	And Prototype 2 on PC finally making its way out.
4464702	4466183	That was quite delayed.
4468325	4475993	And then also I guess they have a Move Essential bundle for the PlayStation 3 with Just Dance 3 thrown in there.
4478044	4479625	Alright, so that's it.
4500735	4503496	But that is out in Japan this week on July the 26th.
4503976	4508177	Alice Madness Returns gets a price reduction on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4508677	4513858	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade 2 HD version.
4514198	4516579	So that tells me this is a remake HD version.
4517059	4520140	This is a remake of a title that was already out there.
4521180	4523880	I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize from here.
4523940	4524621	It looks like...
4526201	4526641	DYNASTY WARRIORS
4550624	4552866	Nothing really of note on the Vita this week.
4553106	4556169	Some accessories, a new AC adapter, but that's not that exciting.
4556689	4565277	So lastly on the 3DS this week, Cave Story 3D makes its way to Japan this week, as does a new pen in cobalt blue.
4565557	4566438	Ooh, ah.
4567039	4568600	That does it for Japanese releases.
4568800	4569341	Alan, UK.
4570422	4571763	UK and Europe.
4572144	4575127	Prototype 2 on PC is coming out July 24th.
4575768	4583437	July 25th, we have Wizorb, which I would recommend very much if you're into 16-bit retro sort of games.
4583477	4587701	It's 2D, but it's an RPG, Arkanoid Breakout mashup game.
4587942	4590425	So it's got the Super NES graphics, and you're a little wizard.
4590925	4592566	playing Breakout, and it's really fun.
4592827	4593487	I have that on Steam.
4593527	4593868	It's cute.
4593948	4599452	Yeah, it's also, check out the Steam sale before it goes away because I got it a couple days ago for like three bucks.
4599673	4602895	And on indie games for Xbox if you don't have that.
4603156	4604437	Oh, nice.
4605017	4609401	So that's specifically on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PSP.
4609941	4611082	Wizorb also on July 25th.
4612203	4630528	Recketeer which is the game we were talking about earlier July 27th we have Inversion on PC and Pokemon Conquest on DS and then finally for this week on July 28th Freaky Forms Deluxe Your Creation's Alive which is a very silly name I don't know what that is
4631892	4636216	All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.
4636296	4642842	DarkSakura may not be here to give the classic game out, but SalaciousPop will fill in, and we'll figure out what he picked in just a minute.
4643262	4644003	For now, Loki.
4644764	4646545	So this is kind of interesting.
4646906	4656935	You may remember a few years ago there was a class— I mean, there's always class-sashing lawsuits when it comes to Madden and NCAA, but there's one that actually went to court, and they finally settled, so—
4657515	4665398	EA has reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that started in 2008 for $27 million.
4666719	4676683	Also, part of that, they will not be able to renew their exclusive agreement with the NCAA, assuming that the court upholds that.
4677324	4685007	And then, of course, because of that, those who were affected by it, who purchased a
4686784	4698688	EA Sports NCAA game will be entitled to anywhere from $6.79 per game on the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 and $1.95 for the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3.
4703880	4732533	and they're saying that also EA has agreed to stipulation on future license agreements as part of the proposed settlement they will not make any exclusive licensing deals with the AFL for five years and they will not renew their current agreement with the NCAA and also they won't be able to enter another exclusive licensing agreement with the NCAA for five years and the exclusive I guess well the trademarks for like the NFL and stuff are not affected by it because this is only the NCAA
4733753	4761182	but uh it's still interesting yeah I was gonna say I don't follow sports titles as closely you know I think that's pretty obvious if you listen to the show for a while but obviously these are huge money games I know EA's had a lot of they've taken a lot of shit for their exclusive agreements in the past this kind of seems like a big deal here I mean granted the the refunds that people get aren't that big a deal although I heard that whatever people don't claim will go to child's play which that's great but
4762202	4762542	It sucks.
4762562	4762782	It sucks.
4788052	4791393	Well, it sucked because it didn't have those licenses.
4791953	4793753	It didn't have as big of a budget.
4793873	4795574	But it sucked as just a game, though.
4796274	4799815	Not to say they couldn't pull something out, but I don't know.
4800375	4808337	Then the other thing, too, is that they have to wait on approval from the court, which is going to happen on September 27th.
4808357	4812518	So this is all, right now, the settlement, but the court has to say, okay, we agreed it.
4812578	4813538	The settlement's fine.
4815319	4816879	So we'll just have to see what happens there.
4817253	4836526	and we should say again the NFL trademark is not it's not affected no this does not affect Madden at all so um but I just think it's funny though is our arena football is also I mean they haven't had an arena football game in forever although I didn't remember they did try that for a while they had an arena football game for like two years what about the XFL game I'm just kidding
4839602	4840904	The Lingerie Football League
4855976	4858137	I'm telling you, that's a real thing.
4858717	4859717	I might play that.
4863279	4864659	That sounds awesome.
4865419	4868660	You know the problem with those lingerie football leagues and stuff like that?
4870141	4876323	I mean, the people watch you because they're hoping that a top gets ripped off, and it never fucking happens.
4877203	4878424	So that's my problem.
4878564	4879584	It's not adult enough.
4880664	4881745	We need an adult...
4883226	4884047	I need an adult.
4884247	4891935	There's only so much plausible deniability on why you're watching it before it's like I could have looked at so much porn in the time that I've been watching this.
4892196	4894458	I'm just going to take it that next step further.
4894558	4896921	I'm watching this because I think they play really good football.
4898374	4899355	No one's believing that.
4899695	4900896	So you're reading it for the articles.
4901316	4901996	Yes, of course.
4902436	4903917	I'm watching this for the articles.
4904157	4910161	You know what would make – getting away from sexy women for a minute, you know what they should license into a game?
4910821	4911522	Puppy Bowl.
4911602	4911762	Yep.
4912102	4913943	They've already done that because you see – Get out.
4914063	4914323	No, no.
4914403	4915184	It's not Puppy Bowl.
4915384	4919366	But remember, there was the – God, who was it?
4919466	4920727	It wasn't Joe Montana.
4920867	4923569	It was Jerry Rice Dog Football.
4924269	4928873	It came out on the Wii last year, about a year ago, actually, because I remember... Okay.
4929834	4934237	Well, the problem is that was Joe Montana, who's kind of, you know, he's long... It's Jerry Rice.
4934297	4934858	Oh, sorry.
4934918	4943505	Well, Jerry Rice also kind of, you know, it's not that hot-ass ref that they had on the Puppy Bowl the past couple years.
4943585	4944165	Not this year.
4944245	4945266	And really, you know why I failed?
4945326	4946367	No kitten halftime, so...
4947908	4948429	Good point.
4948730	4952235	So Jerry Rice and Nidus Dog Football was the game.
4952295	4960227	Do they have any – I have a – the talk about chicks and football and all this has me thinking about one of my good friends and I follow her on Facebook and all this.
4960247	4962271	She's getting really into roller derby lately.
4962657	4965199	Are there any good roller derby experiences on consoles?
4965339	4970723	You know, I want to say, I thought there was a roller derby game, but probably not.
4971003	4972504	I don't think there is a roller derby game.
4972964	4973665	Which is sad.
4973685	4977288	I mean, perhaps... There's quite a roller derby audience, though.
4977308	4979129	She's got, like, a trading card and everything.
4979209	4979890	It's pretty cool.
4979910	4991058	Perhaps, you know, they will come out with one because, you know, there was... There's been plenty of games for, like, what was it...
4994392	4997297	for lacrosse and for rugby and that kind of stuff.
4997437	4999140	So maybe we'll see that.
4999601	5004649	I am seeing, though, there is... Yeah, Jam City Roller Girls was actually a game that came out.
5005089	5005430	Oh, okay.
5006391	5008535	It was on, I think, the Wii?
5011092	5015157	Stan in our chatroom says, you mean Asuka?
5015237	5019462	She was the girl that was on the tester who was on the show about six months ago at this point.
5020803	5022925	I follow her on Twitter, but not Facebook.
5022965	5025148	And I forgot, she does Roller Derby too, that's right.
5025208	5026770	No, this is a different friend I'm thinking of.
5026990	5027871	Yes, WeWear.
5027991	5029933	It was on WeWear, Jam City Roller Girls.
5031034	5036518	It is an authentic, well, I don't know how authentic, but it is a roller derby game.
5036778	5038759	So they do have one.
5039640	5040080	All right.
5040560	5041141	There's one.
5041441	5043823	Which is, you know, they should have more than one.
5043943	5044723	It looks decent.
5046464	5046724	All right.
5046744	5047345	Let me move on.
5047405	5048125	I got to go to this.
5048165	5048466	This is...
5052133	5052754	Oh, God.
5052934	5054615	I'm just going to put this out there.
5054715	5058298	And, Alan, I'll wait for you to make some smart-ass comments so you get ready, okay?
5059479	5064102	I don't even really want to plug the website by saying its name, but I'm going to have to.
5064243	5067745	So I want to just preface this by saying I ain't endorsing this shit.
5067865	5070187	I just have to report on how ludicrous it is, all right?
5071328	5078693	There is a new website out there, and it's basically, from what it sounds like, it's kind of like Adult Friend Finder, but for gamers.
5078713	5079054	Okay?
5079554	5081856	and it's called Shag-A-Gamer.
5082976	5084897	It's launched in the United Kingdom.
5085298	5085578	Sorry.
5085598	5085938	Really?
5086038	5090441	I can't imagine that's in the United Kingdom with it being called Shag-A-Gamer.
5090621	5094103	Because I don't believe anybody uses the phrase Shag.
5094343	5094964	Yes, they do.
5095384	5098006	Every time they see Austin Powers, they want to say Shag.
5098026	5101007	Yes, Austin Powers featuring a British spy.
5102548	5103369	Yeah, baby.
5105461	5109163	Wow, that's some current stuff there.
5109503	5111465	Current material you got working there.
5112105	5118509	Austin Powers, a franchise that hasn't been around for years now.
5118869	5123572	It is what they're calling the number one adult site for gamers.
5123592	5124973	Of course they're calling it.
5125513	5126534	Yeah, we're number one.
5126594	5128175	Well, who's their competition?
5131264	5132024	Exactly.
5132264	5132964	Who cares?
5133345	5139386	They're offering their services to thousands of single gamers who want nothing more than a quick shag.
5140486	5141427	Yeah, baby.
5143107	5148749	For just £19.99 a month, you get full access.
5148769	5149669	This is a quote, quote.
5150029	5156891	Full access to young, old, exciting, sexy individuals wanting no strings sex.
5158083	5162385	They're apparently coming soon as a Shaga Gamer TV as well.
5162965	5170348	Now, I do want to say, and this is important in their quote, they do not mention female gamers.
5170368	5171308	It's going to be all dudes.
5172369	5172849	All dudes.
5173869	5182073	So technically, yes, there are young, old gamers that want to have sex with no strings attached, but they're all dudes.
5182913	5184774	The site continues, quote,
5213321	5220683	and out of all those thousands of people that are hooking up, they have 56 followers on their Twitter.
5223268	5227870	I believe the OLR Twitter has something like 700 or 800 followers.
5228270	5233292	So would it be fair to say that if suddenly we said, you know what, we don't want to be just an internet radio show anymore.
5233672	5236813	We want to be a place for casual gamers to find a fuck.
5237253	5241135	We would be able to say, now we are the number one company.
5241515	5243216	So suck it, Shagga Gamer.
5243956	5244796	There's a problem with that.
5244836	5245837	I don't give a fuck.
5248820	5249060	Alan?
5250640	5254821	This just makes me curious as to how many hookups happen at E3 or PAX.
5255221	5256542	Do people get laid at those cons?
5256782	5258062	I'm sure they do.
5258142	5264804	PAX, there's been articles where people will post Craigslist notifications.
5264964	5267364	It's a meetup for an orgy, basically, at PAX.
5267764	5268865	They will do that.
5268925	5270665	Yes, they do that.
5271105	5272266	and Anime Cons.
5272526	5275027	I mean, there's a lot of geek sex going on.
5275127	5277728	Anything with a furry crossover, then yes, obviously.
5277828	5278768	Dragon Con?
5278968	5280229	Yeah.
5280469	5282390	Why do you think all the guys from VOG are going?
5282450	5283250	I'm kidding.
5283410	5286712	I don't mean stuff that's set up like that on Craigslist, but just...
5287492	5289232	Oh, hey, I see you at the Nintendogs.
5289332	5291053	Oh, I'm in that hotel, too.
5291453	5291653	Room 4?
5292333	5293133	I got some wine.
5293193	5295434	You know, they have a phrase for a reason.
5295514	5297834	You know, a fool and his money are easily parted.
5298854	5300255	Don't be a sucker.
5300335	5307096	Obviously, there are not sites like this that are, there's just tons of hot gamer girls just waiting around for someone to just fuck them.
5307136	5314337	Why are there any guys here that fuck me, me, Mrs. Attractive Gaming Loving Girl with big titties?
5314777	5316558	I'm sorry, that does not exist.
5317498	5317978	Anywhere!
5318358	5322880	So, you know, all these sites that want to charge you money and stuff like that.
5323120	5324981	Like, for example, there's a perfect, what was it?
5325021	5332043	Remember the gaming one where you would join up and you'd play games with hot gaming girls and stuff like that.
5332163	5335904	And they would, you know, have video cam time with you.
5336064	5340986	And they may undress somewhat when you're playing Battleship or something.
5341266	5341966	I don't know, Alan.
5342006	5343047	I might shag that gamer.
5344904	5348727	That image on their splash page is hilarious.
5349587	5358193	Because I can't tell if it's just a really cheap stock image photo that they just photoshopped the Shagged Gamer thing on his shirt or if that's an actual photo shoot.
5358213	5359154	No, because she has it too.
5359174	5359634	She has it too.
5359714	5360635	Yeah, I could shop that.
5360655	5361675	That would be hard.
5361695	5363456	So that's a photo shoot that they had.
5364077	5366538	About as hard as that might be right there.
5367459	5368680	What am I pointing at, Alan?
5368740	5369020	I know.
5369160	5370401	Look how well defined that is.
5370461	5372342	Yeah, she's lifting his shirt.
5373203	5374464	Yeah, I think that's a photoshop.
5376545	5379428	at his junk, I guess, but you don't need to lift his shirt.
5379468	5380809	I don't know what's going on in that picture.
5380969	5386913	But then they show some of the actual users of the site, and like, you know, Paula, 25, she's waiting to get shagged.
5390576	5391237	I'm sorry.
5391377	5392738	Okay, here's my question, though.
5395788	5397771	What is so gamer about this?
5398092	5404261	I mean, is it like, you know, you want someone to fuck and then cuddle and play Skyrim with after?
5404622	5408328	Can't you just go on OkCupid and set gamer tags as your match?
5408468	5410371	Like, only show me people that have this filter?
5411112	5412333	That's what I'm thinking.
5412553	5413073	Exactly.
5413193	5413834	You can do that.
5413994	5420577	Or even if you're looking to date somebody, there's even that Geek2Geek site, which I hear is okay.
5421158	5430163	But you're better off with something like an OKCupid or Plenty of Fish or something like that, where it doesn't really cost you anything to do it.
5430223	5434105	Because these sites, they basically, oh, yeah, it's free to sign up, free to sign up.
5434225	5437447	And then you sign up, and then you're like, oh, I want to talk to this person.
5437467	5439908	I want to send them a message saying, yes, I would like to fuck you.
5440308	5442030	Oh, I'm sorry, that's going to cost you money.
5442611	5443712	You're not a premium member.
5444172	5445934	And then you become a premium member.
5446595	5449858	Oh, sorry, you're not blah, blah, blah.
5450058	5451740	You need more money to do this.
5452241	5453162	Let me put it this way.
5453182	5457326	These people that they have, the models that they have here are not on their fucking site, okay?
5457386	5457786	really tiny, really
5483042	5483482	I don't know.
5483502	5484183	Alright, anyway.
5503871	5526622	I think we've spent far too much time on this topic yeah just don't give them your time I mean that's basically the moral of the story just go to Craigslist but be careful like there's some real freaky people on Craigslist Craigslist is just weird freaky people let's go to a time when games were a lot similar
5530425	5536147	Back when we were innocent and we weren't thinking about such pervert things.
5537547	5539368	The classic game of the week.
5540028	5548310	Every week, DarkSakura goes into the vault and finds a classic game that she deems worthy of you to revisit all over again.
5548671	5558173	But since she's at a wedding, Alan's here and he dug into the shoebox to find the classic game that he thinks you all should play this week.
5558313	5559574	Alan, what is the classic game of the week?
5560475	5565137	Classic Game of the Week is a LucasArts game on the Scum Engine.
5565177	5565917	Came out in 1993.
5565977	5568898	It is Maniac Mansion, Day of the Pinnacle.
5569578	5570098	Good pick.
5571359	5572319	Got any audio for me?
5573059	5574540	I'm getting some up right now.
5574980	5576561	Made a poop sound.
5581161	5582823	This amazing intro.
5582863	5588589	So yes, this is the sequel to a previous Classic Game of the Week, Maniac Mansion, which came out in 1987.
5589010	5594496	You play Bernard, who was one of the cast members of the first game.
5595177	5597740	You are called back to the mansion by...
5599130	5624040	I'm totally blanking on his name, Dr. Fred, because the Purple Tentacle has drank some toxic sludge that made him super smart, and he's going to take over the world, so you and your two friends have to go back in time to prevent him from drinking the slime and becoming super smart, but something goes horribly wrong with the time machines that are made out of porta-potties.
5624760	5625721	They're modified porta-potties.
5629139	5629619	Listen to the audio.
5659179	5676035	they fixed the engine that they used in this for Salmon Max Hit the Road which was the other game I was debating using tonight but yeah so you've got give, pick up, use, push, look at, open and you just click that you click on your verb and then you click on what you want and you interact with the puzzles that way
5676996	5682941	Bernard stays in present day, his sort of overweight rocker friend, very hair metal.
5683522	5691088	Hoagie goes into the future, and then she's kind of a Daria Morgendorfer, Ally Sheedy and the Breakfast Club kind of spazzy girl.
5691769	5694211	She goes back in time to the colonial ages.
5694251	5695532	Crazy Edisons forever.
5695912	5696813	Do I have that backwards?
5697093	5697654	I forget.
5698234	5699135	She goes to the future.
5699796	5700717	Hogi goes to the past.
5700937	5701337	That's right.
5701698	5703059	Sorry, I haven't played this game in years.
5703539	5705201	But it's super awesome.
5705961	5711927	They went and looked at a bunch of Warner Brothers cartoons for the visual, like how they wanted to do the art direction.
5712287	5715270	And also a lot of the sound effects are taken directly from the cartoons as well.
5717432	5723716	And yeah, it's got Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are some of the cameos that Hoagie has to deal with in the past.
5724837	5731781	And it has a great endgame when it all comes together and all the three characters are joined again.
5732021	5733582	It's a lot of fun.
5734402	5756002	this game also was one of the first few CD games for one it was a computer game that came out on CD-ROM and also had full voice acting which at the time I think King's Quest 5 the Sierra game which came out I think in 91 also had voice acting but a lot of it was really bad the voice acting in these LucasArts games even though for the early 90s are phenomenal
5757714	5760215	Amazing voice acting considering that it was new technology.
5760315	5769138	Because when this came out on PC and PC were just getting talky video games, we were playing the Super Nintendo for about a year or two because that came out in 91.
5769318	5771859	Just show the timeline of how the technology was.
5773982	5785989	But yeah, I actually installed, I still have this, I have the original instruction booklet and the disc, and I installed DOSBox on my Windows 7 machine so I could play this in Salmon Max.
5786289	5789972	Does this come on LucasArts' pack that's on Steam?
5791573	5793694	Good old games has it, I want to say.
5794074	5794775	I don't know about Steam.
5795775	5798880	I remember there was some type of LucasArts mega pack of adventure games that was on.
5799120	5800682	Because that's how you could get loom and shit.
5801143	5801383	Yeah.
5802365	5812519	And for people who are into emulators, DOSBox is just... You still need the game with DOSBox, but if you have SCUMM, SCUMM is also an emulator specifically for LucasArts games that run on this engine.
5812939	5816181	Actdeft clarifies, nope, it isn't on Steam at all.
5816401	5817662	So it is not a part of that pack.
5818603	5819063	Go figure.
5819824	5821205	Also some other comments on this game.
5821685	5824787	Burr says, Day of the Tentacle is the best adventure game ever.
5825367	5829350	Dungeon Buster says, this was LucasArts at the height of awesome too.
5829930	5839837	This and Sam & Max, I don't want to try to put one over the other, but both of those games together are just phenomenal adventure games for that era of PC gaming.
5841477	5844918	Anything else you want to say about Maniac Mansion Day of the Tentacle?
5846199	5847199	Hilarious.
5847319	5850980	One of the funniest games I've ever played aside from Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity.
5851480	5854401	Which, I'm sorry, Mike Judge wrote the script.
5854441	5855441	It's a hilarious game.
5855461	5858082	You'll have to pick that next time.
5858182	5858842	Yeah.
5859442	5861103	And I want to say... There's...
5865164	5881397	I want to say that I'm trying to find the actual site for this rumor, but I think it might be Telltale Games, but someone somewhere wants to put out an episodic franchise that exists in the same universe that references Day of the Tentacle.
5881437	5886021	I could see that, because, you know, as much as people love this game, nothing ever really came after it, you know?
5886181	5888263	Yeah, no, Maniac Mansion 3, do you think we'd get?
5888644	5891927	Well, LucasArts has been all about, literally, Star Wars games for what?
5892948	5896012	Pretty much since, once this era ended, they've just been about Star Wars, really.
5896292	5901057	And Grim Fandango was their last big splash in PC adventure games.
5902258	5903520	But yeah, super awesome.
5903660	5904481	People should check it out.
5906061	5911326	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Maniac Mansion 2, Day of the Tentacle, or just Day of the Tentacle for short.
5911746	5912727	Thank you, Alan, good pick.
5913788	5915329	A good PC adventure game.
5915710	5918572	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5918612	5928761	We have plenty more show when we come back, including Rapid Fire News, and we're going to revisit Xbox Security again, but this time it might not be as much ranting as it's been in the past.
5928801	5933025	We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5939520	5948983	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on Sunday, July the 22nd of 2012, with episode number 466 of our show.
5949563	5951104	DarkSakura, not here tonight.
5951204	5960226	She is at a wedding in Las Vegas, the wedding of Tiara and Dan from geek-life.com, and we want to once again wish them a very happy wedding.
5960266	5964448	I see the pictures are starting to show up on Facebook, and all I can say is, aww.
5965968	5978556	Alright, I promised a giveaway here in Part B, and again, this is a code generously donated to the show by Bashka, and you can visit his website, critcraft.blogspot.com, if you like World of Warcraft stuff.
5979097	5986782	Even if you don't, he tends to have some other little gaming things that sneak in there too, and the types of stuff that a lot of OLR people, I bet, would be really into.
5987823	5991906	What we are giving away, once again, it is a beta key for Ravaged.
5992806	5997410	I can play this little gameplay trailer here that he sent me there on the Facebooks.
5998871	6000712	I guess there's some gameplay in this trailer here.
6000752	6008598	It's a first-person shooter that is set in a world ravaged by a polar shift pitting scavengers versus the resistance.
6008818	6015303	So as soon as this ad finishes playing, I'll play a little clip of the gameplay trailer.
6015843	6026629	and we're going to give this away right now to somebody that is checked in at vognetwork.com and in our chat room and of course wants the code because I'm going to send them a private message and be like, are you going to use this code?
6027169	6029330	And if they will use it, there you go.
6029811	6031812	If they don't, then I'll give it away to somebody else.
6031832	6032972	I remember this one.
6033072	6035354	Yeah, it looks like a lot of... This is the game that was supposed to be like Rage.
6036534	6038235	You know how rage is supposed to be.
6038255	6041677	It's, you know, like fighting in Doom Buggies.
6041737	6045699	Lots of like Doom Buggies, planes, that type of stuff.
6045759	6047080	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
6048221	6050542	Might want a pretty decent computer in order to play this.
6053397	6055359	Alright, let's see who we're going to give that away to.
6055379	6057161	We're going to do this live right now.
6057221	6062126	What I'm doing right now, I'm pulling up the list of people that are currently checked into the show.
6063127	6067992	Alright, so I need you, Loki, you checked in.
6068272	6069413	Are you trying to win this too?
6069633	6070935	No, I just check in all the time.
6071335	6073197	Alright, pick a number between 1 and 30.
6075079	6076240	Alan, pick a number between 1 and 30.
6077801	6105443	23 23, so that's 31, 39, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 I want to see if that person is in chat right now Hopefully they have a similar name or I might not be able to identify them I think you can just Google a random number generator and put in the 1 to 30 It's more fun if I ask you I'm looking I don't see that person in chat right now I'm looking one more time
6106960	6107821	Just making sure.

6211544	6215766	They're adding Japanese businessmen to the game.
6216506	6222689	There's DLC that's coming out that you can play as a salaryman.
6223610	6225811	Well, businessmen can be pretty savage, too.
6226031	6226871	Let's be real.
6226931	6228052	So you can play the game.
6228752	6230093	God, I hope you don't have to mate them.
6231033	6232114	That's going to be weird.
6233995	6235256	But yes, so that'll be coming out.
6235456	6237778	I'm looking forward to the game when it finally makes it over here.
6238458	6241140	Actdeft in chat says, isn't it being localized for the US?
6241460	6241741	Yes.
6241901	6242401	Yes, it is.
6242481	6242781	It is.
6243902	6248226	Ray Deer at live.vognetwork.com says, I want to be the guy, damn it.
6249326	6251068	I'm sure that's what a lot of people say playing that game.
6252844	6255986	Manos, The Hands of Fate Manos, The Hands of Fate
6282912	6283713	How bad is it?
6284094	6284555	It's pretty bad.
6284595	6286479	I've fallen asleep twice trying to watch it.
6286659	6290186	Once, both times with Mr. Science Seeker 3000.
6290226	6292290	Oh wow, and it was still bad.
6292390	6294334	It was still so bad that I fell asleep.
6296152	6296512	All right.
6297153	6299075	Well, let's move on to some other stories.
6299215	6302178	First up, Rock Band Blitz finally has a release date.
6302679	6305742	They said it would come out this summer, and we're already about halfway through summer.
6306122	6307403	Well, we finally have a date for it.
6307423	6310747	PlayStation, August 28th, Xbox Live.
6312148	6314190	A day later, August 29th, it's going to cost you $15.
6316772	6320815	And some more songs were revealed for the game that will be in the game.
6321155	6326738	Cool and the Gang's Jungle Boogie, My Chemical Romances Sing, Fun's We Are Young.
6326818	6330280	And that's like the song that won't go away off the radio at all.
6331301	6333482	Avenged Sevenfold's So Far Away also there.
6333742	6335864	And a lot of people very excited about this.
6335924	6340947	It uses all the DLC from Rock Band that you might have built up on your hard drive.
6340967	6342808	And if you're like me, you have a lot.
6343857	6344317	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6365854	6366214	That's right.
6366294	6376136	An anonymous tech at NASA laser engraved the space core on a part that is going to be flying on a resupply craft to the International Space Station.
6376556	6379936	Valve posted about it on their official portal blog on Friday.
6380797	6381937	They don't know who did it.
6381997	6383757	It was an anonymous tech at NASA.
6384177	6393259	NASA did not endorse this, but it's happening because they actually laser engraved this little Wheatley in space.
6393459	6394259	It's not Wheatley.
6394359	6394919	It's a core.
6396328	6396969	Thanks for watching!
6409674	6410175	Oh, that's right.
6410235	6410795	Okay, yeah, right.
6411256	6411636	Okay, yeah.
6411656	6413738	Wheatley Zemo about it and then there's the other guy in the background.
6413778	6414238	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6414758	6416360	It's been a little while since I beat Portal 2.
6416420	6417401	I beat it when it first came out.
6418021	6418581	So, anyhow.
6420203	6422805	And if you're going to kill me because I gave a little spoiler there, you know what?
6422845	6425547	Game's been out a year and it's been on sale for like five bucks lately.
6425647	6427789	So, I'm thinking you haven't played it at this point.
6431011	6437412	Also, lastly, EA gets a lot of hate, but they did something that's pretty cool this week.
6437912	6445274	They joined Microsoft, Viacom, Google, Zynga, another company that gets a lot of hate, and eBay on this that's pretty cool.
6445695	6454057	It is a amicus brief that declares opposition to DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which legally defines marriage between a man and a woman.
6454737	6466680	and EA in a press release said quote DOMA presents a number of problems for businesses like EA as it creates regulatory tax and discrimination complications for employers and that's why we're standing against it.
6466800	6474882	The underlying lawsuit impacts all employers no matter how big or small and no matter the industry and we encourage other businesses to join these efforts.
6475402	6476182	And that's pretty cool.
6476302	6479584	EA's been pretty supportive of LGBT causes in the past.
6479904	6483606	They actually marched in the Pride Parade in San Francisco and in Seattle.
6483906	6488728	They've done their own It Gets Better campaign video that's available on YouTube as well.
6488788	6496911	So a little less evil doing the right thing and standing against DOMA, which obviously we here at OLR also think is kind of crap.
6497552	6500753	So let's move on with some more stories.
6502685	6507488	The Los Angeles Comedy Club Laugh Factory, which is world famous.
6508069	6512511	I think the first stand-up comedian that ever performed there was Richard Pryor.
6514072	6517034	Dave Chappelle has done like six-hour sets there.
6517655	6518775	So yes, world famous.
6518815	6521557	They have a charity to help kids and all this stuff.
6521697	6527101	They are coming out with a streaming channel for PS3 on PlayStation Network.
6528021	6556060	PS3 only from this story $3 a month if you're a stand-up comedy nerd like myself and you listen to stand-up comic podcasts like Greg Proops and Aisha Tyler like I do you might like this I know stand-up comedy isn't really as relevant now as it was in the 90s but yeah Laugh Factory Los Angeles Club $3 a month both pre-recorded and live performances from stand-ups no real schedule yet on the content but if you're a comedy nerd
6557601	6558822	We've got three bucks a month to burn.
6559682	6560283	It's kind of neat.
6560343	6560903	Something different.
6561103	6561263	Yeah.
6561704	6564845	Although you can get it for free through some of those other podcasts you mentioned.
6564865	6565106	Yeah.
6565506	6566186	Well, that's... Yeah.
6566546	6571529	And then also the Dreamcast Classic Jet Set Radio.
6571830	6574431	It's a very funky, amazing, cel-shaded game.
6574531	6582936	It's coming to iOS and Android this summer to complement the PC and Vita versions.
6583416	6583536	So...
6584717	6589159	I remembered the Dreamcast one, the original, and it was an amazing game.
6589199	6595942	It eventually got too hard for me to like, I think by the time I unlocked the fourth or fifth character, it just got so hard I couldn't do it anymore.
6596822	6604085	The learning curve for the controls was when you got it, you got it, but it took a while.
6604205	6609407	I cannot imagine how this is going to play on a touchscreen unless they really tweak the controls.
6609587	6614049	But yeah, funky Jet Set Radio goodness coming to your phones this summer.
6616638	6616918	Hold on.
6635899	6636419	What are you looking?
6636660	6638100	No, don't just say something.
6638140	6639902	Don't Google it.
6640002	6639902	17.
6640102	6640982	17.
6640682	6640982	All right.
6641042	6643084	So if Ragenator was 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
6646366	6646606	All right.
6646646	6648908	I know that person's in chat and I know he'll respond.
6649548	6653871	That is VXJasonXV is number 17 to check in tonight.
6661176	6661496	Hold on.
6661936	6664618	Buy me a little time here, guys, while I send Jason a private message.
6668337	6668898	and DarkSakura.
6685242	6688745	All right, we're going to get into the Fugle question of the week here.
6688906	6693250	Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and our Google+.
6693330	6695492	Put them together and you get Fugle.
6696393	6697914	I don't have the music queued up this week, sorry.
6698995	6699176	But...
6700937	6703779	We read some of the responses here on the air.
6703999	6706321	I don't think we'll get through all of them.
6706781	6711144	There was a lot of responses tonight, and there's no way I'm going to be able to read all of these.
6711284	6716848	Please, please check out our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and our Google+.
6717228	6719470	There's a few responses over there, too, believe it or not.
6720890	6722291	I don't have a URL for it.
6722311	6722291	11094.
6722872	6724453	No, I'm just kidding.
6724513	6725414	I'm not going to read the whole thing.
6725454	6727295	Just go to Google+, and search for Orange Launch Radio.
6727315	6727995	You'll find us there.
6728576	6729656	Here's the question of the week.
6730937	6737002	Kind of a tricky question because obviously there was a lot of really tough stuff that happened over the weekend.
6737162	6740004	You know, just a lot of really unfortunate events.
6741044	6746728	And when tragedy like this happens, unfortunately people like to point the finger at video games.
6747689	6771040	and so I wanted to ask this question to our Facebook and Google communities and that is sometimes when tragedy happens commentators on big news channels are quick to blame video games for a person being so deranged what if anything can we do as a gaming community to stop this reputation and show that there are far more good people playing video games than bad you know because when that
6772589	6776111	Incident happened in Aurora over the weekend, which was terrible.
6776811	6785656	They splashed that guy all over the news, as the news tends to do, which is really unfortunate because they're just making him famous by doing that, which I hate.
6785696	6788118	It should be the victims we should be remembering, but anyhow.
6789018	6793482	They always bring these commentators on because everybody wants to know, why'd he do it?
6793882	6794422	Why'd he do it?
6794482	6795723	What was going on in his head?
6795803	6797885	He was a quiet kid and he went crazy.
6798145	6798865	Why'd he do it?
6798905	6799406	Why'd he do it?
6799466	6802908	And somebody always inevitably says, video games.
6804329	6805030	Which is ridiculous.
6805510	6812772	The problem with playing video games is it's as common now to be playing video games as it is to watch TV, so you can blame TV now too?
6813932	6822915	It was that rock music he was listening to, it was those comics he was reading, it was the TV he was watching, it was the movies he was watching, it was the drugs.
6824026	6829210	and some people blame Batman because he said when he got arrested or whatever that he was the Joker.
6829871	6830191	You know?
6830411	6831952	It was the goddamn Batman.
6832192	6834094	You know who is to blame?
6834774	6835175	Him.
6836055	6836576	That's it.
6838077	6852288	There was a fake article that circulated on Tumblr the night that it happened saying that he was arrested in like Joker cosplay and which of course is full of shit not true but it's like why are people photoshopping fake
6854249	6866096	I don't like talking about him, but I will entertain that there was a picture of him with crazy hair that was on the internet.
6866116	6867717	Again, anything can be photoshopped, I guess.
6868418	6871199	Well, it was on his adult friend finder.
6871599	6873461	Oh, it's those sexual deviants!
6874338	6875579	Look, no, it was him.
6875919	6876859	It was his fault.
6877199	6877759	He did it.
6878360	6879040	I mean, whatever.
6879100	6881481	Anyway, two words.
6881601	6882081	Fuck him.
6882241	6882542	All right.
6883202	6887464	Let's get to, though, how do we keep the bad reputation off of gamers?
6887524	6890445	Because there's far more good people playing video games than there are bad.
6890925	6892966	Let me go to some of the answers on Facebook.
6893026	6894347	RedTheHaze starts us off.
6894387	6900811	The first thing we should do is not get online and attack the people who blame video games because it just proves them right.
6901272	6902472	Think before you act.
6902853	6907856	We need to bring ourselves out there and show our positive side and drown out the negative noise.
6908356	6912499	Make a YouTube video or write up on how we are productive members of society.
6912819	6914740	Just don't be an asshole on the internet.
6914820	6915721	It's as simple as that.
6916721	6945110	or don't watch those news programs because they're sensationalist to get people to watch them Ronnie B says usually it's the news media so I'd ask them how is their constant coverage endorsement of graphic stories 24-7 any less likely to drive someone mad than a video game even if the results of a tragic event is inspired by a video game what can you do when the person is a grown adult there is already the ESRB in the US so I don't think you can really blame video games anymore and I think that's the best argument
6945430	6946230	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6967661	6972002	And part of the reason he did it was he said, I want to be famous.
6972282	6974343	I know I'm going to be plastered all over the news.
6974543	6975343	I'm going to be famous.
6975443	6976323	I'm going to be the most famous.
6976664	6977264	He said that.
6978184	6983946	Well, in this interesting, ironic twist, that all happened on September 10th, 2001.
6985966	7010201	so he wasn't famous for very long because the media hopped right on to something else well he got his 15 minutes I mean and it's just like I'm not trying to be funny it's just this really hugely ironic thing and it just kind of points out I mean god I hate using that word in conjunction with such tragedy but you guys know you know what I'm getting at it's that he you know was driven by fame
7011798	7013360	Attention whores, that's what they are.
7013420	7013981	Yes, right here.
7016384	7016744	Let's see.
7017125	7021530	Clover N responds saying, promote all the charities connected to video gaming.
7022832	7024734	Acidic Vampire says, nothing.
7025155	7029220	It's a waste of time trying to educate our tards who scapegoat.
7030552	7030812	The End
7051986	7058769	WhyNot18is9 responds and says, Parents, it's not the only solution but a start on knowing what your kids are playing.
7059169	7064091	If there's a problem with the kid's brain, then a video game might be the start of stifling the problem.
7064291	7065131	I could be wrong, though.
7065291	7065911	Great show, guys.
7068962	7069682	Picaruno says,
7088642	7098258	If you're really interested in how TV really works from an insider's point of view, I urge you to watch Charlie Brooker's Screen Wipe, News Wipe, and Games Wipe on YouTube.
7098900	7101344	Very interesting comment from Picaruno, kind of from the inside.
7103335	7105056	Last one from Facebook, Cody T says,
7129927	7141572	So in conclusion, there is no good or even great way to get media to stop blaming it on video games because media is media and at the end of the day, true gamers know that it is not true.
7144420	7145321	Complicated issue.
7145761	7146822	Before I go to Google, Alan?
7146942	7160790	With all the, you know, with Chris Hardwick's franchise Nerdist and all this stuff, the progress that gamers have made with like PAX and just crossing into the mainstream and being more of an accessible thing for, you know...
7163472	7173596	It's not as niche as it once was, but the reality is that it's still considered for the people ages 45 and older who watch the news, who get really into this stuff.
7174056	7176137	It's still a part of the counterculture, I guess.
7176197	7178498	It's still something that a lot of people can't relate to.
7179178	7182379	That makes it a magnet, like Loki was saying about the sensationalism.
7182840	7190123	If he was a huge sports nut who was a jock who got super late in high school and he was just a big sports freak and did not...
7191523	7196784	even own a console, they wouldn't pursue that angle because that's considered normal.
7196804	7201745	They would pursue it as he was a sexual deviant because he had an adult friend finder profile.
7201785	7210547	Yeah, they would say, okay, well, what's the first thing we can find that's even a little bit not as bland and as mainstream as possible?
7210947	7214268	Video games is often that thing because a lot of people over a certain age don't understand it.
7214918	7225527	Let me ask this question, and I'm taking a devil's advocate angle, because I think a lot of this sensationalism happens because we just want to understand, as a society, why?
7226307	7227769	Why did this happen?
7228129	7233393	Why did evil, there's no other word to describe it, why did evil happen?
7233614	7236996	Where did we as a society fail to allow this to happen?
7237016	7240759	Well, here's the other thing, too, is they keep saying he operated on his own, but how'd he get in the theater?
7241740	7242181	He bought a ticket.
7244202	7245442	He had to suit up though, right?
7245462	7247583	Did you hear what they got up to?
7248123	7249723	Where is he going to hide an AR-15?
7250164	7259806	Regardless, I mean, I believe I had heard something and read online he used an emergency exit to go to his car and propped it open so that he could get back in the theater.
7259866	7265327	Regardless, the guy had his house booby-trapped to the nines to try and kill some policemen too.
7265808	7268448	I mean, he was clearly deranged in all sorts of ways.
7269188	7270149	He thought of a way.
7270609	7271349	He thought of a way.
7271929	7272610	So whatever.
7273090	7276813	I mean, but again, let me go back to the devil's advocate question.
7277654	7280557	What's wrong with wanting to know where did we fail as a society?
7282618	7284640	Well, that's the difficult question.
7285080	7298472	The easy question is to just say, this terrifies me and I'm confused and hurting and this is a horrible story, but the media is saying that it's video games and I'm old and I've never played those and I don't know anyone who plays those, so...
7299072	7323425	I can sleep better at night knowing that it's that evil yucky thing that's influencing people to do this it's the quickest way to get people to like they need to associate something because they just they don't understand it and it's unfortunate that video games is often used because it's a billion dollar industry it's everywhere people will pay attention if you obviously lie and say bullshitty things about the industry that aren't true because people that play games know that it's not
7324245	7326266	and hope it doesn't happen to them.
7346021	7373480	you know because already people talking about well was he mentally ill had he tried to get help before and then he was denied help you know there are all these existential questions about what drives a person to do this but people need like they're like oh shit this like I'm terrified this is a horrible story if they can just make that mental association of oh he was influenced because of this maybe and that's scary and weird because I'm old and I don't know what that is they can get that they can pin their terror to something
7374961	7379230	and because I think there is a youth angle to video games, that's...
7382334	7384595	A good go-to for the media, if I'm making sense.
7384955	7385415	No, you are.
7385595	7386076	Absolutely.
7386256	7386636	Absolutely.
7387096	7390897	Osfer in chat says, Me and my mom went and saw the midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises.
7390957	7395179	A lot of people told us that they were glad that we were okay, but I just shrugged it off.
7395559	7398540	I'm not going to let one guy ruin my movie-going experience.
7398600	7403702	It's also funny how now when I tell people they should see the movie, they tell me that they don't want to get shot.
7404122	7405963	Absolutely ridiculous, which I agree with.
7406223	7408924	I mean, what short-term memory...
7412006	7415174	Those people have because it's really unfortunate.
7415696	7418763	Evil people killed people while they were working.
7419597	7420277	on 9-11.
7420497	7425139	Evil people have shot people on college campuses and on high school campuses.
7425539	7428020	Evil people have gone into fast food restaurants and shot people.
7428080	7430400	I mean, it doesn't matter where you are.
7430920	7434642	I mean, that's just the sad reality of the situation.
7434722	7445665	To blame the movie and say, I'm not going to go see a midnight movie because I might get shot is incredibly ignorant and disrespectful of all the history that came before.
7446405	7446765	I think.
7446985	7447245	Right?
7447385	7447806	Am I right?
7448526	7448806	Maybe?
7449026	7449106	Eh?
7450168	7450669	Thanks for watching!
7467870	7475774	We still strive as a society to figure out where were the warning signs so we can catch it before this happens again.
7476234	7477775	How do we stop it from happening again?
7478575	7481076	Anyhow, going to Google Plus quickly.
7483857	7485198	Wendy S on Google Plus says,
7499202	7502186	Ridiculous point in that millions play Skyrim or WoW.
7502466	7509934	I have to agree with Mike, which I'll read in a minute here, that acting like ladies and gentlemen online and not accepting people being jerks will help as well.
7509954	7517522	So let me go to that comment from Actdeft that said, well, for starters, stop acting like dicks on online games or when gaming other people in general.
7518243	7524207	Second, stop acting like you're a badass know-it-all just because you play first-person shooter games, though this applies to other games too.
7524708	7532373	Also, educate the other people that aren't playing video games and pretty much state to them that video games do not cause violence, and especially to parents.
7532713	7535095	Proper education stops this kind of action.
7535475	7540458	Luckily, most people have stopped blaming video games for this type of situations, at least in a general sense.
7541339	7542440	A couple more comments quickly.
7543240	7543881	Redertainment.
7544958	7545198	says,
7573621	7575483	Oh my god, Marilyn Manson then is on the warpath now.
7596029	7611104	he's been charmed there's a whole nother thing Marilyn Manson has basically made a career off of attention grabbing and it's the same thing many people have done in our culture they've made millions off of grabbing attention Alice Cooper, Madonna Gaga
7612285	7612565	Right?
7613486	7615368	Okay, lastly, last comment.
7615448	7618190	Preston Evans says, blame graduate studies for the shooting.
7618251	7619532	He was studying neuroscience.
7619672	7621353	That would do that to anyone's psyche.
7621814	7627639	In reality, there is no current way to stop ridicule of one small part of our society for one great event.
7628019	7631102	When all parties have a part in it, it's too hard to fix that.
7631402	7637628	Just throw one to the wolves instead of all taking the slap on the cheek for your part in the grand plan.
7638269	7638449	Hmm.
7640424	7642125	Alright, I know that's a tough topic, guys.
7642425	7649730	But, you know, again, on CNN, and this happened on CNN within hours, there's that pundit on the TV.
7650191	7650991	It's video games.
7652592	7654454	This is what we have to put up with as a culture.
7654754	7657816	So, some different ideas from our listeners on how to stop it.
7658476	7658997	There you go.
7659937	7661539	Our Fugle Question of the Week.
7662788	7665209	All right, let's try to lighten the mood up.
7666049	7671432	Let's get back into video games, talking about some less serious video games and so forth.
7671992	7675493	Or in this case, I guess this is something a little serious going on on Xbox, right, Loki?
7675974	7676394	Exactly.
7676454	7680696	They've been secretly tightening their security.
7682496	7688739	And this started, I guess, with the spring update that we just had, the one that prepped for the fall update, that kind of thing.
7690219	7697001	Right now it says they are encouraging people to check their security information, update their passwords.
7697962	7705584	And then, of course, the update they said built on security enhancements for the near future.
7706644	7709705	And so I guess they're working.
7709785	7712966	There might be something that they'll announce for the fall update or something like that.
7714847	7734149	My thing is though, I understand that they're going to be secretly doing this stuff, but why go such a secret route with it unless, you know, maybe they're worried that if they said, oh yeah, we're updating our security, people would go, ah, so your security had issues that needed to be addressed and you just wouldn't admit to it.
7734730	7743076	But at the same time, when they do it secretly, it kind of makes me wonder, they really did have issues that needed to be addressed, and they just didn't want to cop to it.
7743517	7751723	So either way, at least they're making a step in the right direction, I guess, but they didn't really say what security measures are being put in place that weren't in place before.
7751843	7754244	I can understand the secrecy behind it.
7754264	7762571	I mean, as critical as I've been of Microsoft on this whole issue in the past, I can understand why they don't want to give it all away, because they don't want to give the people that are hacking the accounts hints.
7762591	7763111	Yeah.
7763271	7767374	So I can understand why they're being very vague about it, and I'm strangely okay with that.
7767735	7769976	I'm glad they have finally come out and said something.
7771217	7771738	Finally.
7772738	7775601	And that they have said that they've taken the measures to stop it.
7775961	7786189	And I honestly think that hackedonexbox.com and their whole little report about that they were working customer service, I think that is directly to thank for this finally coming out.
7786269	7786609	Finally.
7787034	7789457	and then here's some of the details of stuff they do.
7789477	7799346	We increase notifications to members whose accounts may be compromised to add proofs, update their passwords and if necessary contact Xbox support.
7799466	7803130	This helps our team lock down an account quickly, investigate and restore the account.
7803530	7804310	to his rifle owner.
7804670	7813553	We've taken legal action to pull down online posts of gamertags, usernames, and passwords gathered from malware phishing schemes to help protect our members.
7814393	7820455	Our live spring update included many behind-the-scenes improvements that help us build on security enhancements for the near future.
7820855	7832379	We're sending unique codes to security phone numbers and secondary email addresses provided by members to verify authorization for Xbox.com purchases, account change attempts,
7833139	7834821	Not staying from members trusted device.
7835321	7839024	I can vouch for that for a fact because we've had to recently.
7841018	7845381	Because you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to stop their auto-renew?
7845461	7857928	Well, we had some other co-workers I've created accounts for on my old PC, but since I've worked at the company that I've worked at, I've switched PCs, and so they're asking me for a second verifiable thing.
7858369	7862491	Problem is, though, is you can put any phone number you want in there, and they'll just call you with the security thing.
7862531	7867654	So that doesn't really help you, but granted, it will give you a phone number that they can send that to.
7868855	7869276	Cool.
7869676	7870717	Or text it too.
7871057	7872879	That's the other thing too.
7873059	7878424	There's a lot of free texting programs out there that you can get a disposable number for that.
7879205	7881787	It's an extra layer, but it's not foolproof.
7881907	7887453	Have they finally programmed it in on the Xbox where it asks you for your card security code whenever you make a transaction?
7887473	7888874	Because I know that's available on Xbox.com.
7888894	7888934	No.
7888954	7889034	No.
7889975	7890975	Why don't they do that?
7891236	7900519	That would have helped in so many situations because the hackers would not have all those card codes and only let a person do it like three times and then it removes the card from file.
7901179	7902900	It would seem super easy.
7903000	7903821	That's the way to do it.
7904641	7905201	Am I crazy?
7907242	7909823	Well, it wouldn't be as convenient to purchase stuff and that's...
7910288	7913971	Well, too fucking bad because it's the right thing to do.
7914311	7915992	Well, the right thing is not profitable.
7916893	7929662	And then, of course, we're working to reduce market incentives for criminal activity, engaging in identity theft, trading, and stolen accounts, and committing credit card fraud are illegal and violate our terms of use.
7929882	7933285	Those involved in these activities, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7933305	7933845	Blah, blah, blah, blah.
7933985	7935668	So they get banned and blah.
7935889	7936851	But here's the thing, though.
7937191	7938714	Reduce market incentives.
7939736	7945106	Last I remember, I believe Madden now started selling those cards, too, that FIFA was so popular for.
7945527	7946068	You know, those...
7948154	7948574	All right.
7976478	7983820	Um, moving on to another news story here, and this has to do with the Wii U. We haven't talked a lot about tonight, but there's still some rumblings going on.
7983860	7985321	There's always new rumors every week.
7985861	7987361	And this time it's about Borderlands 2.
7988402	7992443	But Gearbox, actually, the co-founder, Brian Martell, came out and said...
7993530	7998414	Good things about the Wii U. Quote, we really like the Wii U. I think it's a really cool platform.
7998434	8003717	I like what they're doing, obviously with the touchscreen, and it will be interesting to see what Microsoft does with their approach to that idea.
8004758	8006319	It's one of those problems of the Wii.
8006419	8009542	The only people who have ever made a lot of money on the Wii is Nintendo.
8010322	8016649	If Borderlands 2 was on the Wii U, the thing I would most be excited about is inventory management.
8017150	8018451	It would be amazing on that.
8018491	8019673	It would just be fantastic.
8020013	8024518	And I think the artwork would look really good with the way they can deal with the resolution and textures.
8024638	8025979	I think it's a really good console.
8026600	8029984	So a lot of people are jumping ahead and saying, confirmed, Borderlands 2 on Wii U.
8032025	8057327	well of course they want to port it to any system they can and if it's easy to port it over then cool but once again it's kind of running into that same issue with what did DS do all the time oh well put the pause screen stuff the inventory stuff on the bottom screen instead of you know having to be a separate screen so do I really want to buy another system so that I don't have to pause my game to change my inventory I don't fucking care I'll pause my game to change my inventory and not have to buy another system for $300
8061297	8066723	But that's assuming, you know, you're a person who doesn't end up buying it for some other reason.
8066823	8067403	I understand that.
8067423	8074351	But at the same time, though, you know, all those inventory things at the bottom screen, you still have to look away from the screen to do all that shit.
8074531	8076133	So, I don't know.
8077193	8094883	Also in related news about the Wii U, another Wii U game, this one's called Rise of the Guardians, has been given a November release date, November 23rd for the 3DS, DS, 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Wii U. So this is another game being released in November.
8094943	8095804	But I mean, come on.
8096904	8099046	Game system to be out by November 23rd.
8099106	8101547	Christmas, Christmas.
8101807	8104649	Do I really need to... Yeah, I'm going to do it again.
8105069	8106490	November 18th!
8106690	8108911	It's coming out fucking November 18th.
8109431	8112333	I don't know that for sure, but it's coming out November 18th.
8113153	8113473	Why?
8113553	8116855	Because everything points to November 18th as the day.
8117515	8119416	I can't wait for it to not be that day.
8119456	8121077	I'm going to play that clip on repeat.
8123718	8125659	Within seven days, November 18th.
8126399	8127480	Would you care to make a bet?
8127700	8128480	I have a costume.
8129521	8130501	You don't have a costume.
8130541	8131422	That does not exist.
8132662	8133023	November 18th.
8135656	8138599	$249 to $349 price range because of three different SKUs.
8138659	8139900	We already covered this on another show.
8140851	8142292	Go back in the archives and find it.
8142752	8144653	All right, Alan, what do you got for us?
8145454	8150196	In the silly and weird lawsuit department, there's this story that's come out.
8150696	8159962	A company based out of Texas, excuse me, a tech patent collector, Unilock is the name of the company, has filed suit against Mojang.
8160422	8165405	Mojang, as some people may realize or remember, is a Marcus Persons company.
8165505	8167526	He's the developer and creator of Minecraft.
8168506	8181294	So this company, Unilock, is suing Mojang for... And this is a typo in the thing that was put out to Mojang, the notice they're being sued.
8182254	8187577	Minecraft with a D. So there's a typo in the claim that gets the name of the product wrong.
8188738	8191620	Specifically for the Android version of Minecraft...
8194423	8202795	The patent that they are accusing Mojang of infringing is a system and method for preventing unauthorized access to electronic data.
8203536	8204777	Isn't that a password?
8205698	8208041	I know I'm kind of ignorant about this patent.
8208602	8210324	I haven't read the whole thing because it's very dry.
8211285	8235152	but specifically the filing references claim 107 of the patent which covers a computer code executable on an electronic device to prevent unauthorized access to electronic data stored on the electronic device so I don't know if it's the certain system or style that Minecraft is doing this on the Android but they're saying oh yeah we did that and only we can do that so they're suing it and Notch
8235752	8239955	has said, unfortunately for them, they are suing us over a software patent.
8240055	8243058	If needed, I will throw piles of money making sure they don't get a cent.
8243998	8245600	Software patents are plain evil.
8245960	8249643	Innovation within software is basically free and it's growing incredibly rapid.
8250143	8251764	Patents only slow it down.
8252425	8259030	Unilock is seeking damages compounded by both pre- and post-judgment interest as well as ongoing royalties from Mojang.
8260311	8261252	So, like, what the fuck?
8261852	8288946	yeah and it's not not Minecraft the PC platform but specifically the Android one for whatever reason and not just saying lol at you all right um this does sound a little patent trollish to me right yeah it's just me because they got the name of the product wrong in the in the suit wow
8290117	8293279	Yeah, good luck with that, guys.
8293339	8294200	Moving on, Loki.
8296561	8298783	People are really trying to get me to wear that Tingle suit.
8298823	8299644	It's not going to happen.
8300344	8301024	Not going to happen.
8302005	8303666	Remember, you lost your opportunity.
8303686	8307369	You should have bought more copies of... What was that again?
8307389	8309110	I don't even remember the name of the title.
8309390	8310311	Oh, yeah, Eye of Judgment.
8311472	8312232	Brown Eye of Judgment.
8313733	8313933	Anyways.
8314754	8316935	So, let's talk a little bit about Ouya.
8318636	8319357	Because, you know, it's...
8320819	8321459	Ben Wattaweek.
8322860	8327624	So, of course, you know, they've been doing updates on the Kickstarter.
8328244	8341033	One of the updates that they did to kind of get people to trust them a little bit more, they let them know that one of the people on the production team is actually the guy that helped launch the Amazon Kindle line.
8342634	8345877	Mufi Gadali, I believe.
8345897	8346617	Yeah.
8348098	8348539	Godly?
8348779	8351281	I don't know how you pronounce his last name.
8351742	8356226	He was in charge of the Kindle line.
8357487	8361090	Basically, his purpose there is to make sure that the system launches.
8362232	8369518	My job at OUYA is to ensure that we meet the needs of gamers and developers and
8371881	8378046	They're trying to get out the software development kit as quickly as possible to prospective developers.
8378667	8381630	Also, they're hiring engineers to join their team as well.
8383832	8389257	Some other announcements that they made regarding the Ouya is that they're going to have an exclusive game to it.
8390417	8404364	Robert Bulling's Human Element is going to have a prequel on the system Human Element is going to be a zombie game that's going to be coming out on consoles in 2015 that's a long time
8406005	8432439	and he's going to have a prequel that's going to be launching on OUYA first actually at the launch of the console and it's going to kind of follow the events that lead up to the actual Human Element game of course also you may remember Robert Brolin from his new studio Robotoki and he originally was one of the developers for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and
8434727	8435267	So, pretty cool.
8435407	8438309	And, of course, he also donated $10,000 to the project as well.
8439469	8442691	So, they've got lots of, you know, they have people sign on.
8442751	8446152	There's actually a lot of indie developers that are kind of jumping on board as well.
8446413	8448974	A lot of them actually have kick-started projects as well.
8450454	8452155	So, at least there's going to be some games on there.
8452235	8459599	And they've been trying to answer questions and whatnot from the community regarding why we've seen a controller and that kind of stuff.
8459819	8459999	Yeah.
8462957	8466458	Well, now that they have a game finally to talk about, what do you think?
8467638	8468718	I think it sounds like a cool game.
8468818	8481601	I don't know what kind of a game it is, though, but there's a lot of other, like, you know, people that are in the Kickstarter, you know, world there, like, that want to bring their games to the console, like, one they're going to be talking about pretty soon.
8481621	8483282	Well, actually...
8485975	8488138	Very soon is another Shadowrun game.
8488820	8491624	They're thinking about bringing that to OUYA as well.
8491685	8497455	There's a lot of games there right now saying, hey, if we get this game out, we're going to put it on OUYA as well.
8500538	8501479	They've got support.
8501619	8507365	I think it's just really early still in the development stage as far as the design.
8507465	8512991	Obviously, they haven't finalized a controller yet, but they're going to have one.
8515253	8519377	They have a beta kit running or a prototype, and that's it.
8521386	8526829	Alright, I'm going to move on with another story here, but first, we finally gave that code away.
8527329	8538976	Instead of doing it to just somebody random, and unfortunately twice we hit people that weren't around, I finally put a call out in chat and I said, look, if you're going to use this code and you want the code, send me a private message right now.
8539516	8546980	And I asked Alan to pick a random number, and the winner was Osfer, won the code, and yes, he's going to use it.
8547180	8548361	So, congrats.
8549061	8549742	Thanks again.
8550302	8555744	Sorry that contest was a little bit of a mess, but I thought we'd do something fun with the new website registration.
8555784	8559946	But oops, I guess people were checking in and then leaving to get dinner.
8561747	8562307	So there you go.
8562808	8565709	At least we know it's going to get some good use because it was an opt-in thing that time.
8566229	8566489	All right.
8568914	8569595	Let's move on to this.
8569655	8583884	I think this is a little bit of a follow-up from last week because I remember we brought the first part of this up because I remember it was about that game on the iPhone that was heavily borrowing, quote, quote, assets from Torchlight and Torchlight was pissed.
8584965	8590088	So they, you know, I guess they went and they went on a Twitter rampage and all this stuff.
8590428	8591689	But here's the interesting thing.
8591789	8597713	The company, EGLS, actually came out and made a statement about
8598933	8600694	I guess, oh gosh, where is this here?
8600774	8613340	EGLS went to Touch Arcades and said, we hardly agree with Travis Baldry from Runic Games, who judged that EGLS wholesale stole most of the assets from Torchlight.
8614600	8618202	EGLS is Entertainment Game Labs, by the way, who is the developer behind this.
8619382	8622744	Only based on the similarity between several small monsters.
8623084	8624945	The judgment is simply untenable.
8625925	8629388	Yeah, except there's a little more to that.
8629628	8635211	EGLS employees say they are, quote, both crazy game fans and ecstatic movie lovers.
8635651	8638293	So the comparisons are an accident at best.
8638893	8643356	Arm Heroes, the last time they checked, was still available on iTunes.
8643416	8645097	It's free to play with purchases.
8645458	8647339	Well, what ended up happening a little later?
8647779	8652382	EGLS did come out and say, all right, we'll remove some parts of the game.
8653022	8657864	So they talk about that they are going to make some small changes to the game.
8658984	8663005	But Runic Games really wants EGLS to admit that they just stole it.
8663365	8663785	Well, they did.
8663845	8666086	They actually stole even the audio from the game.
8666246	8671528	And there were some unused audio clips, like a certain sword or something like that, that they have in Torchlight.
8673328	8676129	All the audio files were named exactly the same as Torchlight.
8676389	8676869	All of them.
8677109	8678930	Like even stuff that they didn't use.
8679235	8680837	He said, I also downloaded the app.
8680857	8683160	You can unzip them and look at any iPhone app.
8683180	8690028	And there was a sound manifest that listed all the sound files in the game and they were verbatim all of our sound files including our own misspellings.
8690749	8690929	Uh-oh.
8691570	8691750	Yeah.
8692651	8693993	So, they stole them.
8695549	8717704	yikes now armed heroes online is now down i guess runic filed a complaint and finally it got taken down but it took a little while that was on when did it finally get pulled july 19th that was thursday when it finally got pulled and we reported on that last week i wonder how many people uh grabbed that game
8719690	8723312	BlackWolf in our chatroom says they're in China, so there was nothing legal they could do.
8723512	8727435	Yeah, they can't sue the company, but they can fight them through Apple.
8727755	8729116	That's what they did, apparently.
8729256	8732398	They can also reinforce stereotypes regarding China.
8733699	8736300	What, that it's thieves and gold farmers and all this?
8737021	8738181	MMOs and all this, or what?
8738482	8743765	They copy and counterfeit stuff.
8745485	8746726	Thanks for watching!
8770419	8791569	hmm but it's gone now and let's I wonder if Apple actually like really hammered the band hammer on them because you know Apple usually when shit like this happens Apple will just say you've lost your license done you're not getting to put publish anymore but most of them just come back under another name you're not gonna publish anymore until you pay another hundred dollars to buy a different license under a different name exactly
8792748	8806983	Alright, every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura, she usually dives into the mailbag headfirst to read some of her favorite emails, but in her absence, she's loaned the hazmat suit to Alan, who will dive into the email bag.
8807283	8810366	I need to state this, we received a lot of emails this week, actually.
8810687	8811628	Yeah, there's a bunch.
8813610	8817293	It's weird because usually we're sitting here with one or two going, send us more.
8817673	8818875	Well, you sent more this week.
8819115	8823219	But here's what we're going to do because we don't have enough time to read, especially after some of the other segments tonight.
8823239	8824840	We don't have enough time to read all the emails.
8825261	8828704	I'm going to have Alan read the first half of the emails that came in.
8828904	8831447	We're going to roll the second half to next week.
8831707	8832748	DarkSakura
8847697	8851461	First email is from Robert M, subject 3 questions.
8851761	8856646	This is Robert M and I just had 3 somewhat quick questions, or rather 2 and an observation.
8857187	8860130	First, have you guys had the chance to check out Spelunky yet?
8860370	8866216	I saw on a preview of the 360 version that someone did a Mac port, so it's one of my Steam shortcuts now.
8866636	8870718	Reportedly, Steam may be getting a version of the game with the 360s graphics and extra modes.
8871658	8874580	Secondly, if you're too... I haven't checked it out.
8874820	8875160	Sorry.
8876461	8878702	Blame the rest of the Steam sale on that one.
8878902	8880703	Yeah, I haven't checked it out.
8880803	8888807	Secondly, if you're too busy with Minecraft based on what you know, do you see updates for the iOS version falling by the wayside with the Android version?
8889947	8914001	because I don't really follow the Minecraft forums enough to I haven't played the iOS version at all it's kind of like for iOS game it's kind of expensive which is ridiculous because I have like $19 credit on my iTunes account right now thanks to gift cards but I don't know I just I've kind of avoided it for some inexplicable reason but you have it don't you Matt have what Minecraft on iOS uh I have it on Android oh you have it on Android
8916064	8922707	I would think that, I mean, Minecraft on PC is so popular because it's pretty, it's like limitless, right?
8922747	8923887	The world just goes on forever.
8924047	8924247	Right.
8924347	8929229	I don't think you can do that on the phone, and I think the 360 has really taken off, so maybe.
8929250	8931210	The phone's really limited what they've got in there.
8931230	8940014	There's a lot of, like, there's object types that aren't there, and there's a lot of things that you have unlimited supplies of because they don't have a waste.
8940194	8969440	yeah technically the 360 version is limited too but there was a story that came out this week they've sold 3 million copies of that it's one of the biggest Xbox Live Arcade titles ever crazy finally going back to the email finally not a question I came across a banner ad for one of those free to play Empire building games with the mandatory woman in the image being Anna Williams as in literally the Tekken 6 character art weird I'm almost certain Namco has nothing to do with this FTP keep up the great shows it's probably from China
8970781	8971341	I'm just saying.
8971401	8974304	I'm just going to refer you to that story we just read.
8974364	8979068	I'm just going to say, just rewind the podcast 10 minutes and go back to that last story.
8979549	8980650	That's probably what's going on.
8980710	8983272	Unless it's an Amco game, but I kind of doubt that.
8983692	8986255	Anna Williams, by the way, was an amazing tech and character, just saying.
8987135	8987636	I loved her.
8987916	8992060	This one I'm not going to read because I think that's an admin question for you.
8992140	8992580	Oh, yeah, yeah.
8992600	8993141	Don't read that one.
8993541	8994562	That is one we can screen out.
8995243	8995643	Okay.
8999096	9001699	Next email from Jeffrey Help!
9002259	9005943	Is there a support group to help me stop buying all of the games in the summer Steam sale?
9006724	9011708	Maybe a transdermal patch to slowly meter out old video games that I will probably never play.
9011808	9013730	Well, you came to the wrong place.
9015371	9037820	I've picked up a couple indie bundles the THQ pack and a few other odds and ends I most likely won't touch half of the games included I'm just interjecting my own note here for all of the games that I bought this weekend or on this week under the sale I don't have the hard drive space to install like half of them at once so yeah it's very easy to have hundreds of gigs of games in your library
9039601	9061723	I most likely won't touch half the games included now I see what happens to old people when they watch QVC that shit is no joke my mother is addicted to QVC and she'll never admit it and she'll hate me for telling you that's a very prescient and terrifying observation and it is 100% correct oh my god Steam is QVC without the host but at least QVC has like Marie Osmond and shit
9062253	9063193	True story, you guys.
9063234	9065274	I think I've mentioned this on the show before for the new listeners.
9065335	9066775	True story, you guys.
9067436	9073418	My mother owns the complete Richard Simmons doll collection from QVC.
9076080	9077861	They're all old lady dolls, too.
9077981	9081002	My mother loves Richard Simmons.
9082343	9082923	Doll form.
9084864	9086845	No, she legit loves him.
9090580	9092343	Please give me some tough love.
9092383	9095188	Yeah, we need like a Scared Straight program for Steve Sales.
9096670	9097231	I agree.
9097352	9100898	I mean, seriously, it's just like spending money I don't have.
9102282	9103522	Please give me some tough love.
9103622	9104503	Tell me to stop.
9105383	9109344	I could also accept encouragement, but that would be detrimental to my wallet.
9109644	9113325	As always, love the show and thanks for the years of entertainment, Lab Rat, Y2K.
9113905	9118946	Again, I'm going to say you came to the wrong place because you probably heard the first 30 minutes of the show.
9118986	9123167	Here's what I would like to see happen a little bit more.
9124699	9131604	To help offset the whole buyer's remorse thing, I would like to see more of an organization of certain gaming nights.
9131645	9133726	Like, hey, let's all play Borderlands.
9134046	9135207	We bought it, let's go play it.
9135247	9138330	Or, hey, let's play some Armored 2 DayZ or something like that.
9138390	9144475	Or, hey, let's play this together so that it's not like, why did I buy this game?
9144555	9145475	Why did I buy Borderlands?
9145595	9150019	Oh, to play with other people that have the PC version, but I'm not actually going to play with other people that have the PC version.
9150675	9153198	Lab Rat, Y2K, let me just put it this way.
9153458	9155360	If you can't beat them, join them.
9155961	9158383	Join the VOG Network community on Steam.
9158443	9164730	There's also an Orange Launch Radio community, but we're trying to kind of push people more to the general VOG one now so we can be even bigger.
9165391	9168434	And more information is available at vognetwork.com.
9169095	9171417	Yeah, I know this one's long, but it's pretty good.
9171577	9171838	So...
9173018	9173498	I'll read it.
9173518	9175259	Do you mind reading it?
9175299	9176239	It is a long email.
9176299	9176559	I know.
9176619	9176839	I know.
9176979	9177219	Okay.
9177939	9178939	Who's it from first?
9178979	9179919	Read who it's from first.
9180699	9181360	Tonic Vision.
9181500	9181800	All right.
9181920	9182480	Now you can read it.
9183340	9183740	Excuse me.
9184440	9184720	Wait a minute.
9184740	9185200	Wait a minute.
9185240	9186620	I got to address this in the chat.
9187001	9190941	Technus in chat says, Richard Simmons scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.
9191481	9191981	Why?
9192602	9194062	Did his nut fall out of his shorts?
9194162	9195402	He's harmless.
9196402	9200763	I have to admit, that guy takes a lot of shit, and he really is just trying to be a good person.
9202028	9202568	You know what I mean?
9227434	9229235	He's got a healthy dose of fabulous.
9230295	9232876	And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.
9233937	9234437	Clearly.
9235838	9236418	Right, Alan?
9237639	9238339	I'm just saying.
9239559	9241720	Just saying out there.
9241820	9243861	If that's what's making him so spunky at age 60...
9245262	9245582	I'm sorry.
9246242	9247082	We need more.
9247583	9249363	I am being completely real.
9249503	9250043	I don't care.
9250163	9252684	Travis, you play this clip over and over on your show if you want.
9253044	9253484	I don't care.
9253564	9254124	Make fun of me.
9254484	9256565	We need more people like Richard Simmons in the world.
9256625	9256885	Really.
9257245	9259606	I mean, there is nothing wrong with Richard Simmons.
9259986	9263327	Richard Simmons is the antithesis of the evil we were talking about earlier.
9264827	9265107	Right?
9266007	9267148	What is wrong with Richard Simmons?
9268308	9268668	Nothing.
9270180	9270561	and DarkSakura.
9283402	9284223	Hi, OLR.
9285203	9286084	Sorry, Tonic Vision.
9287385	9290567	I got a chance yesterday to go check out the Wii U in person.
9291347	9296551	They are doing a Tensity Tour and inviting Club Nintendo members and wanted to share my impressions with you.
9296911	9302195	To preface, I would just like to say that I don't consider myself to really be a fanboy of any particular system.
9302555	9308497	and don't really have a vested interest in one over another because to me they all have various strengths and weaknesses.
9308777	9317700	I own basically every current system including the 3DS and the Vita and am generally excited enough by next generation hardware to be a consistent early adopter.
9318020	9324942	With that said, I really cannot find any way to get excited about the Wii U even after hands-on play with each and every launch title.
9325322	9325903	Why is this?
9326083	9329005	For me, it is because of the following three reasons.
9329045	9334730	So this guy got an exclusive invite to some top secret come play the Wii U in an unmarked building type of thing?
9334850	9338793	Speaking of which, I may actually have an impression of the Wii U after this week.
9339814	9344458	Our Ubisoft guy may be bringing a Wii U to our game conference thing.
9344799	9346040	I think it's probably for Just Dance 4.
9347621	9348982	Is there a Rabbids game on Wii U?
9349022	9349503	I'm sure there is.
9349523	9349863	There is.
9350223	9350864	May or may not.
9350924	9353526	He's trying to get a Wii U dev kit out, but we'll see.
9355743	9355983	Item 1.
9356944	9358705	The name sucks, plain and simple.
9358805	9359866	Why is this a big deal?
9360206	9364509	It's a big deal because it's indicative of the fact that Nintendo has become a little too comfortable.
9364909	9366250	This is still a Wii, folks.
9366770	9370573	Yes, it has a new controller, and yes, the graphics are prettier, but it is still a Wii.
9370913	9393933	2.
9394213	9397438	Well, you bought on Super Nintendo.
9397878	9402344	You take a PlayStation 3, and that's okay.
9402405	9403806	Sequels to consoles are fine.
9403827	9405729	There's nothing wrong with that.
9406250	9407231	Oh, well, fuck me.
9407291	9408913	I guess my whole point's invalid.
9408974	9409795	Thank you, Loki.
9409835	9410656	I've seen the light.
9412694	9421722	Well, I think he's saying that aside from the graphics hardware, I mean, the Nintendo to the Super Nintendo was a huge step in audio, visual.
9421902	9423963	Mode 7 fucked your shit up.
9423983	9426786	All right, Rob, let me put it this way.
9427526	9438856	If there's games on the, like, okay, the jump from the NES to SNES, so you have Zelda and Mario Brothers, and then you had Super Mario World and, you know, Zelda 3, Links to the Past.
9438996	9441618	which are two of the best games ever fucking made.
9441758	9442198	Exactly.
9442519	9447742	Those were amazing fucking games and look at how much better they are than the previous system.
9449284	9450945	Are we seeing that with the Wii U?
9450985	9451425	That's the thing.
9451465	9455128	It's like we have a new Mario game that's exactly like the fucking Mario game that's already on the Wii.
9455848	9456249	That's my thing.
9456429	9458851	If they came out with a game that's like holy fucking shit that's
9459491	9460431	Goddamn amazing.
9460491	9463893	It's so much better than the previous Mario game where, oh my god, look at this Zelda game.
9463933	9464913	It's fucking amazing.
9464953	9466474	It's so much better than the one in the Wii.
9467234	9469515	Then maybe it'd be a different story, but it's not.
9469675	9474036	They are the same fucking game, slightly prettier, but basically the same.
9475837	9477198	It is hard to argue with that.
9477278	9482259	The only thing I could say is that the Zelda game wasn't a launch title, but granted the Mario game was.
9483480	9484980	Maybe the best is yet to come.
9485261	9485641	I hope.
9486061	9486381	We'll see.
9488257	9488777	I would.
9489017	9489177	Okay.
9515527	9541717	I was just telling Alan last night we haven't ordered pizza in a long time and he's like oh you want to go to Papa Murphy's get a take and bake I'm like fuck you no I want bacon sausage that's right we are going like we're gonna call Straw Hat and we're gonna get it delivered in a box can you put a Christmas ham just right on the pizza when I worked at a pizza place I never got sick of pizza I could eat pizza every goddamn day and I would be happy eating pizza every day
9543494	9544235	I understand the point.
9544615	9546697	Item 3 The technology isn't new.
9546917	9550179	I have played games on a touch screen and I've played games with motion control.
9550520	9555003	Putting them together is not innovative and really doesn't bring anything terribly exciting to the masses.
9555443	9563309	Playing through each and every launch title I can say for a fact that not one of these really do something unexpected with the marriage of these two technologies.
9563450	9569094	Perhaps a year or so after launch there will be a handful of third party titles that will push the envelope and do something daring.
9569514	9572396	Sadly Nintendo certainly won't be leading by example.
9573217	9581243	For all of these, excuse me, for all of these reasons, I really find myself at a loss when attempting to justify this purchase at launch, or maybe at all.
9581863	9593572	Sorry for the rant, but that was the feeling I was left with after two hours with the Wii U. And this, I mean, this guy's an Uber Nintendo fan because you had to be to get in the click to go see the system, right?
9593852	9594032	Yeah.
9594673	9597197	But he said that he doesn't really stand for any console.
9597297	9598719	Enthusiast enough.
9598799	9600502	Well, then he's kind of like any of us.
9600662	9606090	I mean, I like Nintendo, but I like Sony and Microsoft too.
9606731	9607232	Some days.
9607352	9607853	It just depends.
9608113	9609435	Who's pissing me off this week?
9610356	9629677	on a separate note I wanted to share with you another preview of some art that will be showcased at the upcoming video game power-up art exhibition this will increase your X attached here are some pixel sculptures we've created one of which was recently featured in your classic game of the week enjoy we encourage all OLR listeners in the Chicago area
9630117	9631498	to come out and see the show.
9631598	9634619	It opens Friday, August 3rd from 6 to 10 p.m.
9634679	9640102	at Gallery 27 at 1833 Halstead and will be open every Friday throughout the month.
9640222	9646305	You can also check out the show online at all one word gallery27chicago.com.
9646345	9649307	I'll paste that in chat in a second if you can't make it in person.
9649767	9651448	Thanks and I hope to see you there, Tonic Vision.
9652168	9664527	Sadly, none of us are in Chicago, at least here in the room, and I won't be through the area, but I know we have some listeners in Chicago, we have quite a few actually, so I expect a full report, tap tap tap
9666255	9666555	One more?
9666736	9668917	I'll do one more, and that's just going to leave three left over.
9668957	9670598	We'll figure out what we do with those emails later.
9670618	9671219	Roll them over.
9671479	9671619	Yep.
9672560	9676062	This is from Nasty Canasta, Evening OLR Crew.
9676242	9685850	Among all the discussion about theatrism's pricing on your show, Bobby Blackwolf's, and around the web, I thought it was interesting that nobody considered to bring up the Square Enix tax.
9686690	9694996	There have been instances where RPGs and related titles published by Square Enix, especially re-releases, have a price that is artificially raised above the norm.
9695317	9698039	Take Squeenix's PS1 Classics catalog, for example.
9698739	9705865	Whereas most games are priced at $5.99, Chrono Cross, Chrono Trigger, all Final Fantasies and Xenogears are worth $9.99 to purchase.
9705885	9707206	You know why that is?
9707246	9708326	Because you'll pay it.
9713123	9713804	Plain and simple.
9714244	9714965	Plain and simple.
9715025	9716947	I mean, there's really no other way to say it.
9717027	9721411	Any Square fan is going to be, this is my own commentary, any Square fan is going to be cuckoo bananas about those games.
9721751	9722532	I mean, they're legendary.
9722552	9724935	And to be fair, aren't they larger games too?
9724955	9727297	Because I know Xenogears was two discs.
9727377	9732081	Yeah, Final Fantasy VII was three discs and Final Fantasy VIII was also three and nine.
9732122	9733403	I think it was four and two.
9733763	9736206	Yeah, so I mean, yeah, but I mean, I don't know.
9736226	9737407	But yes, I understand what you mean.
9737427	9739790	In this day and age, that's kind of a weak argument.
9739990	9745377	Oddly, Front Mission 3 and Vagrant Story do not have inflated prices despite both having RPG elements.
9745437	9747319	And those were more sleeper hits, too.
9747539	9748140	Or cult hits.
9748200	9748681	That is true.
9748721	9749021	For them.
9750102	9751464	And those were also one disc.
9752224	9757188	I'm sure the tax also applies to titles available from Nintendo's Virtual Console service, at least in Japan.
9757588	9758509	Nasty Canasta.
9759269	9760590	I love that name, by the way.
9761311	9767715	And wasn't when Secret of Mana was ported to iOS and put on the Apple Store, wasn't it like really expensive?
9767735	9771618	Like it was four or five bucks, which was outrageous for what it was, just a port of the SNES.
9771858	9778103	I want to say those games on Nintendo and Super Nintendo Virtual Console were like 100 Microsoft points more.
9778823	9782485	or excuse me, wow, 100 Nintendo points more.
9783486	9784466	I'm losing it tonight.
9784947	9787868	Sorry, I was distracted because look who came to say hello.
9788088	9789890	Look who never comes out in the studio to say hello.
9789970	9790390	Look who's here.
9790410	9791130	It's Maruko.
9791450	9792031	Kitty, kitty.
9792071	9792451	Kitty.
9792971	9793992	Do you have a comment, Maruko?
9797574	9798794	He's sniffing the microphone.
9799374	9800795	So how is your cat, by the way?
9801775	9802915	Sanrio is doing much better.
9802975	9806636	She just needed a day to have it, basically.
9807716	9808917	She gets constipated.
9809477	9814918	And when she has a really bad hairball and she's plugged up, it'll tweak this nerve in her stomach.
9815638	9817598	And it completely, like, knocks her out for a day.
9817859	9819159	Where she just, she can't eat.
9819399	9820679	She gets dizzy.
9820719	9822440	If she walks, she'll stumble and fall down.
9822800	9824080	She just needed a day to get better.
9825020	9827342	So, Kitty can't poop, but she can poop now.
9828403	9829224	Sorry for the TMI.
9830805	9834829	It's really scary to see your cat completely out of it and you don't know what's wrong.
9835339	9840864	Well, and a really good friend of ours had to put down their cat this week, and I know that's really difficult.
9841044	9845368	And it was a long time trying to get them better and figure out what was wrong with them, so they finally had to.
9846789	9847190	It's tough.
9847790	9849272	We get really attached to our pets.
9849932	9855417	So I love my kitty, and I'm glad that she's better, but I need to make sure that doesn't happen again, because I don't like seeing her like that.
9856578	9857439	Yeah, that's it for emails.
9858260	9858540	All right.
9859520	9859660	Logi.
9885703	9888244	FU to people that change lanes without signaling.
9888264	9889525	There's a lot of you out there.
9889545	9891146	I don't know why people do that.
9891686	9893367	It's really annoying.
9893667	9904111	Also, FU to the Steam sale for... I guess I should blame myself, but I'm blaming the Steam sale for having me spend way more money than I wanted to on this Steam sale.
9904991	9908193	And buying games that I will probably play, but...
9909413	9912554	Right away, and it just adds more games to the list.
9913374	9916754	And then, yeah, that's it.
9918855	9919395	Alan, you want to go?
9920855	9928777	Yeah, on Friday night, I have this gorgeous 25-inch Hewlett-Packard monitor for my PC, the Pitchron.
9928817	9929337	It's amazing.
9929937	9935998	And on Friday night, it started to flicker, like there was maybe some EMF interference from a nearby appliance.
9937038	9954205	or maybe the backlight of the LCD was starting to go out which was terrifying because I don't want to buy any monitor right now so that sucked but I replaced the I took it off HDMI cable and I plugged it into my video card with a DVI cable and now it's fine so the HDMI cable
9955285	9956146	went bad.
9956426	9961070	So, F you to shitty $8 Amazon HDMI cables that make you think your monitor's dead.
9961090	9963512	Well, you should have got a $60 monster cable.
9963632	9964452	They're all the same.
9964472	9966374	Just buy the cheapest possible cable.
9966394	9968135	Yeah, it was a Belkin on Amazon.
9968175	9970717	It lasted two years, but I guess the HDMI cable went bad.
9970858	9975601	So, F you to heart attacks that, yeah, over technology.
9975621	9979925	Cablewholesale.com, they're damn cheap and it's one day shipping to us.
9980445	9983127	That's where I get cables when I happen to get cables.
9983167	9983348	Nice.
9985000	9986041	Did they pay you for that app?
9986561	9986762	No.
9986882	9987562	Next time they should.
9988063	9989204	But they're SoCal.
9989584	9990585	Actually, no, they're not SoCal.
9990605	9992607	They're somewhere in the Bay Area or something.
9992847	9993668	And so it's only a day.
9996196	9997517	I don't really have a lot of angst.
9997557	9998557	Things are going pretty good.
9998877	10002138	I have a lot going on, so F you to being really busy.
10002938	10015202	And I'm kind of obligated to something over the next couple months that's going to really cut into my weekends, which really stinks because I really need to get back to San Francisco and see Grandpa Warcraft and some other people over there and so on.
10015262	10016342	And F you to the fact...
10017122	10023003	That the annual showing of Showgirls, which we must go to, is the same day as another theater thing I have here.
10023043	10024664	So I've got to make sure I can go.
10025244	10028105	Because I love movie Showgirls.
10028245	10029105	It's so bad, it's good.
10030105	10030845	You don't know shit.
10033706	10034066	Alright.
10037447	10037947	Let's move on.
10039409	10041671	Loki, one more news story for us and then I've got something.
10041711	10049219	And then that's the part where we get to taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10049259	10050680	But after two more stories here.
10051100	10054604	So you can't go to both of those events because they're at different places, okay?
10058147	10058428	Sorry.
10058928	10059549	I've seen Showgirls.
10059589	10059889	That was good.
10059969	10061591	I'm happy you made a Showgirls show.
10061611	10063153	I've seen Showgirls one too many times.
10064335	10065937	And it was only because I wanted to see the boobies.
10066177	10069921	That's really the only reason to watch Showgirls more than one time anyway.
10071223	10071964	Just saying.
10072605	10072725	Um...
10073966	10096882	so let's talk a little bit about kickstarter because why not we we always talk about kickstarter because it's in the news all the time so a couple new games shadowrun online i'm kind of excited about that because shadowrun's pretty awesome um but they're starting a kickstarter they're looking to raise half a million dollars by august 14th so you can go check them out at kickstarter um
10099739	10100780	DefenseGrid 2 DefenseGrid 2
10117379	10117639	and so on.
10142703	10146704	3 quarters of a million, you get a level editor, and then 1 million you get a sequel.
10147844	10151405	It's kind of lame, but that's how they're doing it.
10152045	10162347	And then last but not least, if you're looking for an alternative to Kickstarter, the website GamesPlanet has launched a new service called GamesPlanet Lab.
10162927	10165928	It's basically a crowdfunding service.
10166088	10166748	It's in the UK.
10168228	10191459	which is kind of cool because it's not US only because Kickstarter is US only so you have to have a way to pay via Amazon on that but it's based in Europe and they will have projects from around the world and already they've got a couple games on the service that you can fund one's MagRunner it's a title from 3AM Studios and
10193421	10206228	and it's like a first person puzzler game and then they've also got Day One which is like an adult themed point and click adventure game Like Leisure Suit Larry?
10207352	10211875	They say it's heavily influenced by the Devil's Dictionary.
10212956	10214377	I don't know.
10214677	10215378	Never heard of that.
10216579	10217139	Can't really say.
10217599	10229427	I believe the difference with this service as opposed to Kickstarter, because I think one of the reasons people are kind of like, I don't know about crowdfunding and stuff, how we know we're actually in the game.
10229467	10236432	I think they have a process that they actually kind of review these games before they
10237853	10239313	and allow them to be on the service.
10239493	10243975	Also, it's only going to be games on this service since it is Game Planet Labs.
10246297	10248458	So that's kind of neat, I guess, if they have that.
10251359	10251679	So cool.
10252159	10254000	And so that's the alternative if you want to check it out.
10254260	10258582	It's, I believe, at lab.gamesplanet.com.
10259503	10260063	Want to say?
10261264	10263725	Yeah, lab.gamesplanet.com.
10265256	10281791	All right, well, since you just did a bunch of Kickstarter-esque stuff here, this one is kind of another Kickstarter-inspired thing, but like it or not, Kickstarter is now kind of a part of pop culture right now, and that's probably one of those things that we'll look back on in 10 years and on the next VH1.
10281971	10285454	I love the 2010 decade special.
10286014	10290939	You'll have someone there talking about how everybody was into Kickstarter and the other stuff it inspired.
10291479	10292940	Nino Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, Wizards Edition
10311718	10317422	Well, now they're expanding this for the US based on the number of pre-orders.
10317942	10323666	So it doesn't say though what they will keep adding to it when they hit different levels.
10323706	10326647	But I'm going to the page right now, which you can get at ninostarter.com.
10327868	10336898	They don't say exactly what you will unlock, but apparently if you hit these different pre-order goals, they're going to add stuff to the collector's edition, which is kind of cool.
10337518	10338700	Oh, here it is, the first one.
10338740	10342624	The first item is a set of five Ni No Kuni prints.
10343505	10346628	So little crappy little postcards, basically.
10347229	10348270	You know, if that's, you know.
10348743	10349804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10371138	10395116	yeah all right I think it'd be better if it was like the regular game and you know the more people that pre-order the game like more free shit like they upgrade it for free like do a special edition or something like that and have crap that they throw in there yeah that'd be a little bit better because collector's editions that's really a niche niche niche audience you're you're not going to niche game with a now you know collector's edition that's going to be even more niche than that
10395467	10397810	It's $99, too, if you want that collector's edition.
10397830	10398371	Fuck that.
10398591	10399312	Well, see, here's the thing.
10399812	10411506	Believe it or not, I'm tempted, because I really do love the Studio Ghibli stuff, and the game looks good, but I feel really weird taking that leap of faith when I don't really know if the game's good or not.
10411567	10412928	I guess I could go look at some Japanese.
10412968	10413389	It looks pretty good.
10413829	10415712	I know, but just because it looks pretty good?
10415932	10417294	Come on, what have we learned?
10417634	10421940	Sometimes games that look good don't really end up being very good or lasting a long time.
10421980	10422640	So I don't know.
10423782	10427907	But I do think that doll is really cute, though.
10429649	10431412	And the DLC, might as well.
10431892	10434073	All right, anyhow, we'll see.
10434413	10435754	We'll see if I get on board or not.
10435774	10441837	Apparently, you have until August 31st to do this, and they even have the little countdown clock there on ninostarter.com.
10442197	10445099	It says right now 2,683 fans.
10445279	10447500	Does that mean that many people have pre-ordered, I'm assuming?
10448200	10448540	I don't know.
10449161	10449401	Maybe.
10450501	10452683	But little trailers available there and everything.
10452723	10453503	It's a cute little idea.
10454502	10459584	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10459624	10466506	If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight or maybe there's a story you think we've missed, the Skype line is now open.
10467487	10473389	We'll get to last minute stories in a minute, but I also want to read some of the tweets that have come in at twitter.com slash OLR.
10474289	10482412	And I'm going to start off tonight with a tweet from Dave Falcon tweets us and says, a few days ago, I picked up Duke Nukem Forever at GameStop for $4.99.
10486769	10489220	My How the Mighty Have Fallen and Fallen Quick
10491314	10492214	Would you buy it for $4.99?
10492274	10492494	No.
10492654	10493935	I'd be curious.
10494275	10496155	Well, maybe.
10496175	10500416	Gearbox made Borderlands, dude.
10500736	10505617	I understand that, and it's really sad what they had to work with for Duke Nukem.
10505997	10507458	I mean, that was kind of one of the things, too.
10507498	10511038	It's like they lost a lot of credit with that, but Borderlands 2 looks really awesome.
10511458	10513359	All right, let me go to the phones because we are getting a call.
10513419	10514399	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10514419	10514779	Who's this?
10515339	10516300	Hey, this is X-Link.
10516360	10517420	Hey, X-Link, buddy.
10517440	10517860	What's up?
10518706	10519826	Nothing really too much.
10519846	10522047	Hey, Loki, I'm also hyped for Borderlands 2.
10522147	10531230	I'm so happy that Ashley is actually going to have a role inside of it playing as Tiny Tina, which is absolutely great because I love watching, hey, Ash, what you're playing.
10531350	10533471	So I thought she was great doing those.
10534480	10541802	It's going to be kind of intriguing to see how all that works out after they bring everything to it.
10541842	10547444	It's good to know too that they actually have the game already done so hopefully they'll patch up any kind of bugs or anything within that game.
10547544	10549465	This hype train has me very interested.
10549885	10552166	I'm a big fan of the first one.
10552206	10559208	I have the first one with all the DLC and actually I would like to team up with some people go through the arena part and get the rest of the achievements.
10559268	10562329	I did the first arena by myself but the other ones are just
10564371	10567854	I swear I will try and play the game soon.
10567874	10570396	I had to remove it from my hard drive because I needed the disk space.
10570956	10572238	But it'll be back.
10572978	10574359	Really, a couple things real quick.
10574379	10581205	Chaos Rings from Square Enix is $12.99 actually on the iOS store.
10581346	10584228	And then the sequel, which came out not too long ago, was actually $17.99.
10586190	10588492	So those are really expensive compared to...
10588952	10590973	to Xenogears and the rest of those for $9.99.
10591494	10604080	I'd rather get those anyways, at least that way, you know, I would have a copy I could always play compared, you know, because, you know, stuff happens, you know, discs can break, you know, get scratched really easily.
10604181	10605361	You know, they're very hard.
10605381	10607783	Those are games also that are very hard to come by, too.
10608203	10609764	You look on eBay, you're trying to find them.
10609784	10613566	They were going up to $50, $70, $80 a pop for some of those games.
10613646	10617368	So just to say, oh, well, you know, they're trying to, you know,
10617869	10618631	Galza Price.
10618651	10620777	You know, 10 bucks is a very simple price.
10620817	10621920	I'd rather pay 10 bucks than...
10622977	10623097	50 or 60.
10625179	10626420	The same thing with the Steam sales.
10626861	10630203	I bought the Dungeon Seed Collection for $7.49.
10630404	10633206	That was like 75% off.
10633286	10635248	I bought Brink for $5.
10635428	10642013	I know that's a crappy game, but I like these little first person shooters from time to time after having a rough day at work, coming home and shooting something.
10642594	10644435	It's really great to have some of those stuff.
10644475	10649199	And then of course I bought for my girlfriend the Secret of the Magic Crystal for $1.25.
10649240	10649280	So
10652134	10654995	I mean, you can't really beat those prices for the sales.
10655115	10660377	I'm looking at my iPad right now at the store, and yeah, I mean, Square really does charge a premium for some of their games.
10660457	10662497	Final Fantasy Tactics, $17.99.
10662937	10667199	Chaos Rings 2, just like you said, $19.99 on the iPad.
10667859	10669479	Yeah, I'll pass on that.
10669539	10671380	You can get Imaginary Range for free.
10672256	10689729	Yeah, I have my 3DS that can play some of those games just fine, and I'd rather do it on something like that than worrying about paying 18, 19 bucks on an app that when I'm in the middle of doing something, like you said, basically for Mass Effect 3, it's going to crash upon me.
10690109	10690970	I pass on that.
10693371	10697092	Oh, so it's absolutely 100% bulletproof and it's not going to crash or anything?
10697732	10700853	Maybe, but even then, that's a considerable amount of money.
10700893	10702013	That's a big chunk.
10704214	10710975	Especially since I have most of those games anyways, and if everyone gets the same thing, I really don't feel like paying $15, $18 for it again.
10711015	10711535	I'm sorry, so...
10714884	10726509	And also about these shootings, and, you know, they always, you know, every time when some of this happens, you know, they're always blaming the media somehow, whether it be video games, movies, you know, music.
10726850	10727530	You know, it's kind of weird.
10727550	10728630	They never mention books.
10728890	10730791	Like, what kind of books was a person reading?
10730851	10734933	What kind of reading was a person doing to get to maybe even this frame of mind?
10734953	10737614	You know, because books are just as dangerous as anything else.
10738255	10740876	There's no moving objects or anything within books.
10741016	10741377	Excellent.
10741417	10742738	Some people still blame books.
10742919	10749447	I mean, granted, I'm getting a little historical here, but Fahrenheit 451 was a book, ironically, that was kind of all about that.
10749547	10753953	And we still have in this day and age people that try to ban books from the public library.
10754714	10758438	What, Catcher in the Rye always comes up on that list because it's smut.
10759179	10762180	Harry Potter, no, but... Yeah, absolutely.
10762220	10766762	But, you know, what we need to do, too, is also look at the good stories.
10766802	10768323	Look at the things that are done, you know.
10768483	10771825	Somebody saved, you know, a family or something from a building building, you know.
10771845	10775866	Maybe try to twist out, you know, not really twist it around a little bit.
10775906	10777707	Maybe try to see if that person is a gamer.
10777727	10779428	Say, hey, look, this person was a gamer.
10779448	10781269	This person just saved a family, you know.
10781349	10781489	He...
10782430	10787116	Just because these people are gamers doesn't mean, oh, I like Halo and Warcraft.
10787176	10795086	I don't go around decapitating people, shooting people in the head because I'm seeing this in the game and I'm going, okay, I think this is okay.
10796107	10797329	What about all the good things, gamer?
10797349	10798990	I love that lyric when he goes
10827472	10854783	they blame it on Maryland and the heroine where was the heroine and look where it's at and you know it's kind of funny because those little things it's kind of like looking for that little niche looking for that little thing to to basically saying you know if these weren't here this was you know this would have you know would never happen in the first place though it would and it's unfortunate too because it you know happened in such a closed area but you know like I you know like you said before
10855903	10859325	Even after seeing these stories, stuff happens, I'm still going to go to libraries.
10859345	10861206	I'm still going to go to grocery stores.
10861226	10863228	I'm still going to go to the movie theater to watch my movies.
10865209	10868210	We should let these little things affect our everyday life.
10868471	10873554	And if it doesn't, then congratulations, they win.
10873794	10874834	It's that simple.
10875515	10876235	Very well said.
10876455	10876876	I agree.
10877096	10877416	Excellent.
10877436	10878937	I've got to let you go to get some more calls.
10878977	10879757	But thanks for the call.
10879777	10880157	Okay, buddy?
10880698	10881098	Absolutely.
10881118	10881378	All right.
10881418	10881858	Take care, buddy.
10881979	10882239	Anytime.
10883639	10887241	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10887721	10888662	Go ahead and give us a call.
10889682	10891883	Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
10892044	10893404	I do have a couple of the tweets here.
10893624	10899747	I was just going to comment one more time on the Games Planet Lab thing because that's kind of vague on what exactly they do different than...
10901788	10902428	The Kickstarter.
10902468	10906590	Well, they actually have 10 commitments that they're going to make.
10906750	10926958	One of them, you know, a quality label designed with gamers, DRM, the gamers experience before all, secure payments, respective IP, clear timetable, a guarantee for delivery rewards, virtuous funding solutions, real selection work, project holder identity, and clear information.
10926998	10929099	So basically just kind of providing more information, more...
10931541	10932082	Commitments.
10932863	10934045	Let me go to the phone.
10935026	10935988	Let me go to the phones.
10936028	10936669	We have another call.
10936749	10938031	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10938051	10938391	Who's this?
10939193	10939894	This is Osfer.
10940114	10940815	Hey, Osfer.
10940835	10941196	What's up?
10942702	10945845	I'm happy that I resisted the newel, as Bobby would call it.
10946765	10961718	Yay, but you ended up winning a Steam code, though, so... Yeah, I mean, it's good that I won that, but, like, all my friends are like, oh, I have no money, and now I've been, like, using all my wallet funding on these Steam sales, and I'm just like, I only bought one game, and that game wasn't even for me.
10962258	10964801	Like, I bought Mass Effect 1 for a friend.
10965261	10965821	Oh, there you go.
10966202	10968323	So have you been tempted by any of the Steam sales?
10969705	10969765	Um...
10971129	10971849	Not really.
10971889	10972970	I'm just sort of looking at games.
10975111	10975431	I'm sorry?
10975531	10975932	Say that again?
10975952	10978313	Uh-oh.
10978493	10978773	Uh-oh.
10978853	10979393	Did we lose him?
10979633	10980334	I think we lost him.
10980474	10981214	Can't hear you, buddy.
10981935	10982935	Plug the mic back in.
10983936	10984456	Uh-oh.
10984676	10987858	Oh, it says internet connection problem between us.
10987938	10988838	Yeah, we just dropped.
10989118	10989679	Did we drop?
10990199	10990519	Yeah.
10992040	10992140	Uh...
10993576	10993896	Uh-oh.
10994016	10994377	Yeah.
10994617	10994877	Okay.
10996178	10996838	No, no, don't take that.
10996918	10997259	No, no, no.
10997499	10997899	That's good.
10997999	10998219	We're back.
10998239	10998679	No, don't, don't.
10999060	11002382	It's just a hiccup because we are still... Oh, good.
11002422	11003182	He called right back.
11004223	11005404	We probably lost all the listeners.
11005724	11006064	Oh, no.
11006104	11007385	There went the feed.
11007565	11008206	Hopefully, it'll come back.
11008626	11009206	Hey, you still there?
11009226	11009887	Can you hear me?
11009967	11010828	Yes, we can hear you.
11011028	11011588	We're taping.
11012148	11014690	Go ahead and keep going with your question for the podcasties.
11014750	11017992	We're offline right now, but the podcasters are still hearing this.
11018032	11018172	So...
11019233	11023675	I had asked you if there was anything that you were wanting off of Steam.
11024415	11024915	Oh, yeah, yeah.
11025195	11030138	Well, I was, like, looking at, um... I'm tempted by Amnesia and Alan Wake.
11030158	11033079	Like, Alan Wake won because I heard it's kind of Silent Hill-y.
11033859	11035080	And so I might like that.
11035280	11040862	And Amnesia actually did... I watched a group play through it, and I played, like, a little part of it myself.
11041342	11043323	But, like, there are some bits and pieces I missed, so...
11044119	11046741	I should really get the full game, but I don't know.
11047021	11048342	That game made me terrified at some point.
11048502	11056028	There's actually a video of me playing through it at one point, and I'm just screaming when I do something blatantly obvious that hurts me.
11056628	11057008	I don't know.
11057289	11057809	It's a great game.
11057829	11060351	Wait, you're saying there's this video like it's out there on YouTube?
11061051	11061331	Yes.
11061952	11062993	Oh, you need to give me the link.
11065054	11065735	Okay, here.
11066415	11067476	It's a video of like...
11068050	11070311	A bunch of people in my group down at college.
11070352	11072853	We all get together and we play games late at night.
11073153	11074494	And that was one of them.
11076035	11077336	And it just has all the screams.
11077376	11080798	And you film your antics and put them up on YouTube for your adoring public?
11081418	11082119	It wasn't me.
11082239	11084580	Okay, it was the guy who was in our group.
11084620	11085941	He brings in his desktop.
11085961	11089463	And I don't even know this, but he has a microphone sitting behind the desk that we're playing at.
11089724	11091845	And he's just recording everything.
11092045	11094747	And so he takes the scream and then he slows it down.
11094847	11096788	And it's pretty hilarious.
11099660	11105962	Alright, well while you're looking for that link for me, is there anything else you want to call in to discuss tonight?
11107162	11118445	Nothing else other than the fact that I might regret getting my friend Mass Effect because if he gets really into it, then he'll eventually get to Mass Effect 3 and then I'll be like, oh, I want to play with you online.
11118585	11120846	I guess I have to get the PC version now too.
11121066	11121426	Crap.
11122082	11123403	Well, look at it this way.
11123483	11124824	You'll never be able to connect.
11125045	11126646	So just, you know, don't get your hopes up.
11127207	11128468	Yeah, that's true.
11128748	11129148	All right.
11129609	11130209	All right, buddy.
11130309	11130690	Take care.
11131430	11132071	Enjoy that beta.
11132892	11133192	All right.
11133272	11134133	Thank you for it.
11134153	11134713	Hey, no problem.
11134733	11135274	Thank Boshka.
11135514	11135814	Take care.
11136615	11136795	Bye.
11136975	11137195	Bye.
11137856	11138216	All right.
11138236	11143361	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
11143861	11148605	While I still wait for that link for the video of...
11150626	11165633	Osfer screaming at the amnesia because I think amnesia reaction videos are really funny I love the one that Alan put on my wall on Facebook of the guy playing through amnesia where it just starts and like the first door opens he's like lol nope and quits it's like a 10 second video
11166733	11169655	Alright, let's go to the phones again and hope the phone doesn't drop during the call.
11169715	11171075	Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.
11171095	11171455	Who's this?
11171936	11175277	You're such a hater about the Mass Effect 3 PC game.
11175377	11176638	It pisses me off.
11176818	11178079	How can you not be mad?
11178579	11181020	Because the Xbox does the same exact thing.
11181621	11184302	But you haven't, no, Xbox hasn't robbed me of credits yet.
11184781	11185522	It doesn't matter.
11185662	11191245	It robbed you of playing it on PC, and that's a far worse offense.
11191545	11193267	Surely you didn't just call to complain.
11193407	11194387	What else did you call about?
11195568	11197589	No, actually, I was all complaining.
11198630	11201532	Because I'm mad you didn't play Jack Levin's theme.
11201792	11205316	during that F-Zero break when it's clearly the best song in the game.
11205456	11209600	The folks listening on the podcast don't even know that we played F-Zero music during the break.
11209660	11210401	I don't care.
11210741	11211582	They're not special.
11212924	11214505	They didn't get to hear F-Zero music.
11214545	11216247	Views and opinions of Shane or Shane's.
11217088	11217368	What?
11217749	11218389	No, I'm just saying.
11220311	11220672	Anyway.
11220752	11222594	Making sure the podcast listeners know you're a jerk.
11223595	11224196	There, you know that.
11225917	11235343	and now I have to go find my copy of F-Zero because I may need to play it even though my flipping people off finger is so badly hurt right now.
11235724	11237965	Yeah, you cut your finger before the show.
11238025	11238606	That's not good.
11238626	11240727	You were posting pictures on Facebook and they're really gross.
11240787	11241568	Why do people do that?
11242228	11244569	I don't need to see your wounds all over Facebook.
11244949	11247930	My finger is kind of like the current model 3DS.
11247970	11249290	It has three different layers now.
11249350	11256792	It's got the fingernail and then the finger and then the huge flap that's left over where my finger got cut.
11256832	11257953	You're disgusting.
11259913	11260193	No.
11260273	11262814	The picture you posted of your dog was much better.
11263955	11265875	Yeah, he was tuckered out from all the blood.
11265975	11268736	All right, look, did you have anything else you wanted to talk about tonight?
11270375	11271796	No, no, not really.
11272616	11273617	I just wanted to complain.
11273857	11274617	I was kind of bored.
11274818	11276078	Then I'm going to let you go, hater.
11276859	11278679	No, not if I do it first.
11280700	11281361	And he hung up.
11281441	11281921	There you go.
11282641	11284122	Thank you, Shane, I think.
11285203	11285443	All right.
11285723	11291526	Anyhow, let me... I want to go to one other... Okay, this is the YouTube that Ossifer was... Oh, this is a six-minute long video.
11291606	11291966	Oh, good.
11291986	11293147	He linked me right to the right part.
11294207	11295388	Good job, Ossifer.
11298433	11298914	It's loading.
11298934	11300135	I'm going to have to wait for that to load.
11300516	11301076	It's buffering.
11301677	11302858	Meanwhile, we'll take one more call.
11302918	11303860	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11303880	11304220	Who's this?
11305121	11305622	What up, guys?
11305642	11307003	It's Xenocore from the OKC.
11307043	11307784	How you guys doing?
11307804	11308625	Hey, I'm good.
11308665	11309586	How you doing, Xenocore?
11309606	11311348	Hey, no, staying employed.
11312710	11314052	In this economy, that's a hard thing to do.
11314887	11315388	Yeah, yeah.
11316949	11321493	Actually, I've been playing a hell of a lot of the Streets of Rage V5 remake that got pushed out.
11322034	11322714	Oh, yeah.
11322734	11324876	Did Sega succeed in getting that pulled?
11326297	11327919	It already escaped to the internet.
11328019	11328980	There's no stopping it.
11329280	11329801	That's right.
11330101	11333404	They may kill their own personal link, but it's out in the wilds now.
11334445	11335285	That's very true.
11335866	11338528	So what made you decide to play this remake?
11338548	11340230	You just love Streets of Rage?
11340848	11343591	Dude, they did rearrangement of Yu Suzuki's music.
11343611	11345513	What version do you need?
11346414	11348155	You thought F-Zero's music was good.
11348176	11351099	You put that stuff on with real instruments and everything behind it.
11351139	11351659	It's amazing.
11351679	11353601	You want to put it up in the club and just play all night.
11355443	11357705	So the soundtrack alone is worth checking it out for.
11357745	11358206	That's cool.
11358746	11359827	Yeah, I ripped the whole thing.
11359867	11362670	It's already on my phone so I can listen to it in my car when I'm driving.
11363171	11363511	Awesome.
11363852	11364152	Awesome.
11365031	11366931	Yeah, but it's actually a pretty faithful remake.
11368572	11370932	It's all pixelated and everything, even if you make it full screen.
11371332	11374553	It's almost like playing on MAME or something else like that, but it's all custom.
11375453	11376673	It did quite a good job with it.
11379233	11385574	In fact, I understand why Sega might want to squash it, because it's almost a better version of what they've been putting out for their games.
11385915	11388555	It's better than what they do to Sonic in some ways.
11388575	11389035	Exactly.
11389115	11389635	Probably.
11389675	11390555	Yeah, I could see that.
11390615	11391195	I could see that.
11392436	11394276	So, what else is on your mind this week?
11395800	11397362	That's pretty much it.
11397402	11403910	Steam's taking care of everything, but they still can't lure me to Skyrim until I get a game of the year version so I can get all the DLC at once for one price.
11404010	11404551	Thank you very much.
11404751	11406714	There is no DLC on PC yet.
11407034	11409998	I believe the Vampire DLC comes out when?
11410038	11411080	It's got to be really soon, right?
11411943	11414404	Yeah, but sooner or later it will.
11414444	11422088	But I did pick up the Arkham City DLC for $3, so I played my two hours of that and was like, ah, okay.
11423769	11424609	Oh, yeah, that's right.
11425089	11427891	That was a big thing that was on sale during the week, too.
11427951	11428591	I forgot about that.
11429171	11431833	Yeah, almost all the DLC has their own little mini sales.
11431853	11435415	You just got to go into the game to see them if they're not currently running on the front page.
11436875	11438256	So y'all got, like, what?
11439253	11445236	30 minutes, one and a half hours to go and check out all the DLC that you want so you can get it at a worthwhile price.
11445536	11445896	That's right.
11445916	11446936	You better hurry, everybody.
11448357	11449297	And that's all I had.
11449357	11449897	Good show, guys.
11449937	11450237	Keep it up.
11450398	11450638	All right.
11450678	11451278	Thank you, Xenocore.
11451298	11451918	Appreciate it, buddy.
11451938	11452598	Have a good one, okay?
11453219	11453479	Later.
11453679	11453899	Later.
11455080	11457322	And that's about, sadly, all the calls we can take tonight.
11457362	11458682	I'm very sorry we didn't get to everybody.
11458722	11460163	The phones were actually blowing up tonight.
11460263	11462065	I'm loving the participation, though, you guys.
11462105	11463065	Thank you for emailing.
11463586	11464326	Thank you for calling.
11464366	11469069	I'm sorry we couldn't get everybody, but be sure to, like, you know, send us more emails.
11469229	11471671	Participate on the forums at vognetwork.com.
11472071	11473052	You can also tweet us.
11473132	11474352	I will do one more tweet here.
11474393	11475593	That video won't load.
11475613	11476954	I'm going to have to try after the show.
11476974	11479636	It must be just our internet connection is kind of jank tonight, I guess.
11480196	11480336	So...
11483041	11485644	Anyhow, let me read this real quick.
11485664	11488167	This is a link from Tigerclaw, and I love this story.
11489569	11496557	Microsoft had to apologize because a programmer hid the phrase, big boobs in company software.
11498672	11499393	and DarkSakura.
11513752	11521915	Now, apparently there's a string in the hexadecimal computer language that says, in hexadecimal, Big Boobs, if you can figure out how to read it.
11522315	11532259	The code was spotted by programmers and caused controversy within the community because, of course, they want to distance themselves from being just an all-male pig-headed club.
11532679	11533479	But I don't know.
11533519	11536000	I think Big Boobs is harmless.
11536040	11536580	That's funny.
11536760	11537560	I'm sorry.
11537580	11538521	Big Boobs is funny.
11539541	11541604	Even women like boobs, right?
11542145	11542365	Yes.
11542586	11544629	If Jamie were here, she would say yes, trust me.
11546031	11548174	But they say, oh, it's childish humor.
11549716	11550517	It's just boobs.
11551479	11552240	It's just boobs.
11554156	11555778	Alright, that's all I have for the tweets.
11556319	11558001	Loki, do you have any other last minute stories you want to read?
11558021	11559142	Yeah, just one thing.
11559222	11563527	There's a new Operation, because you know there's Operation Rainfall.
11563928	11574120	So now there's Operation Zero, which is trying to convince Nintendo of US to bring Fatal Frame 2, the Wii edition, to the US.
11576400	11580524	So they've got a Facebook page you can go check out.
11581165	11589993	So just search for Operation-0 and they're going to have a letter writing campaign starting this week, July 25th through the 27th.
11591715	11592295	Good luck with that.
11593716	11595298	I finally got Osfer's video to load.
11607672	11614058	Did that scream really come out of the same guy who called us a minute ago?
11631862	11633684	You know, I haven't installed that game yet.
11633804	11634625	I have that game.
11635025	11638889	Yeah, I have it too, but I'm afraid if I play it, Alan will be there with a camera.
11638909	11639850	I can see you making that noise.
11639930	11641251	I'm going to make that same noise.
11641291	11642653	That's why I'm not going to play it.
11647446	11649367	Alright, so that's it for Last Minute Stories.
11650107	11650447	That's it.
11650507	11653648	That's it for Twitter topics and that means that is it for the show.
11653728	11657750	We are about on out of here but not before we get everybody's final thought.
11658450	11661791	Alan, thank you so much for sitting in on the show tonight in place of DarkSakura.
11661952	11662512	Appreciate it.
11662732	11663572	A pleasure as always.
11663652	11665653	Good job and thanks for your insight.
11665693	11666293	Appreciate it.
11667434	11668294	Hopefully we'll see you again.
11668334	11668974	Don't be a stranger.
11668994	11673456	Hopefully you'll have more Sunday nights off in the future if your boss is listening.
11673556	11674056	I'm just kidding.
11674957	11675997	I know you like making the money too.
11676808	11678049	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners?
11679089	11681450	Hamburger Helper helps your hamburger make a great meal.
11683051	11683431	Thank you.
11683571	11684211	That's very deep.
11684571	11685292	It's insightful.
11687192	11688453	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11689033	11696536	My final thought is next week on Saturday I want to play some serious Call of Duty.
11698797	11703519	And the week from that, or week from Wednesday, I want to play some serious Ritter Player One.
11704369	11705572	Lots of stuff on the line.
11706014	11706475	Good luck.
11706615	11707016	Good luck.
11707036	11707778	Win a DeLorean.
11707818	11708721	Win a DeLorean.
11709102	11709383	Do it.
11710004	11712531	My final thought tonight is Nutter Butter.
11714144	11714724	So that's it.
