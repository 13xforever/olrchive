0	20720	Tonight, July 22, 2012, has a hugely anticipated title being cancelled, Microsoft secretly
20720	31600	steps up security and Steam heads to another platform.
31600	35700	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange
35700	36820	Lounge Radio.
36820	43200	It is episode number 466 for this July the 22nd of 2012.
43200	47440	We're here to talk about video games and the gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle with you
47440	53600	guys who are participating live at the VOG Network, live.vognetwork.com to get in the
53600	55600	chat room and chat with us.
55600	59360	And of course, we want to acknowledge the folks listening along in the podcast form
59360	60360	as well.
60360	64340	I know a lot of us listen to us on their Mondays to help get through the work day or throughout
64340	65480	the week or what have you.
65480	69900	So thanks for tuning in and thanks for participating in the not-live format.
69900	71840	We just are very happy to have you all here.
71840	76880	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,
76880	79120	DarkSakra, not here tonight.
79120	80880	She is in Las Vegas.
80880	83920	I'll come back to that in just a minute, tell you a little more about that.
83920	86360	But joining us tonight here in studio, we do have Techmaster Loki.
86360	87360	Hi.
87360	88360	How are you doing, Loki?
88360	89360	I'm doing good.
89360	92640	You are playing a game over there that you're giggling like crazy over.
92640	93640	What is this?
93640	94640	I want to be the guy Gaiden.
94640	95640	Oh dear.
95640	96640	Oh dear.
96640	101160	I remember I Want to Be the Guy was one of those like impossible games, right?
101160	105960	I just like the look of it now because it's all 16-bit-ish now and it's, you got a lot
105960	106960	of homages.
106960	110480	Well, obviously the first one had a lot of homages to stuff, but I mean the first level
110480	114840	is it's bionic panda, so I mean it's pretty awesome.
114840	118080	What is the appeal of these games that are just impossible to beat?
118080	119400	Is it the whole- It's not impossible.
119400	121800	They're just really hard.
121800	122800	Next to impossible.
122800	123800	Well, here's the thing.
123800	125920	I have a couple reasons why I'm playing.
125920	127480	One because it's fun.
127480	129820	Well, it's hard, but it's still fun.
129820	136600	Two because I'm thinking one of two things is going to happen for the next gate challenge
136600	138680	for Ready Player One stuff.
138680	142320	It's going to either be a game that's hard like this or it's going to be a text adventure
142320	143960	game.
143960	145780	Be my guess.
145780	148060	I'm not good at either one of those.
148060	150400	It's time to go back and study up on Zork.
150400	154240	Pretty much, yeah, because that was one of the challenges in the book was Zork.
154240	156120	Oh, okay.
156120	157400	Yeah.
157400	159140	You are standing in front of a White House.
159140	160160	There is a mailbox here.
160160	162920	What do you do?
162920	163920	Open mailbox.
163920	166260	Take letter.
166260	170080	You better read up on your FAQs for the old school Zork games.
170080	171640	All right.
171640	176660	Well, also joining us here, since Star Soccer is not here, we like to invite other people
176660	182000	to come on and host, and we have our old favorite standby host who doesn't have a choice because
182000	183000	he lives here.
183000	184000	Say hello to Allen.
184000	185000	Hello.
185000	186000	How are you, Allen?
186000	187000	I'm great.
187000	188000	Awesome.
188000	189300	Thanks for coming back tonight.
189300	190300	You're welcome.
190300	191300	What's new with you?
191300	195080	You're like, I asked a bunch of people, I can't get a guest host.
195080	196720	You have to do it.
196720	198840	And I was like, oh, so I'm like sixth choice.
198840	199840	That's great to hear.
199840	203880	I asked one other person and then I was too lazy to ask anyone else.
203880	207080	So I just, you know, tap, tap, tap.
207080	212440	And the other person I asked was Flaco Jones, who, you know, to be fair, was here that night.
212440	213440	He's bad luck.
213440	214440	He's me.
214440	215440	He makes power go out.
215440	216440	Yeah, it's true.
216440	217440	Maybe it's best you stay away.
217440	218440	I'm kidding.
218440	219440	I'm kidding.
219440	220440	I'm kidding.
220440	221440	But he has like babies and things.
221440	222440	Yeah.
222440	227680	When you have babies and things that, you know, priorities and all this stuff.
227680	229080	I understand.
229080	234680	Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show at live.voggenetwork.com.
234680	236240	Act Def starts us off tonight.
236240	238840	Allen, the host without a choice.
238840	240760	All right.
240760	243800	Well, Dark Sakura isn't here tonight.
243800	246480	She's in Las Vegas and she's at a wedding.
246480	250780	She is at the wedding of Tiara and Dan.
250780	252560	And you may or may not recognize those names.
252560	256560	Tiara is somebody, she's been on OLR before, but not like in a really long time, but she
256560	260800	came up here to Sacramento because Tiara and Jamie have been friends for a very long time.
260800	268160	But Tiara and Dan are both two of the big writers at the site Geek Life or geek-life.com.
268160	270940	And we've done a lot of stuff with them over the years.
270940	274640	They've been really wonderful in promoting us and we've tried to promote them where we
274640	275960	can.
275960	278640	They got married today, geek-life.com.
278640	281700	A geek wedding happened today in Las Vegas.
281700	284800	And of course, since Jamie and Tiara go way back, she flew down there for the wedding.
284800	285800	So I think that's great.
285800	287360	What geek theme do they have for the wedding?
287360	291000	I know they had like a giant doctor who doctor who everything.
291000	292000	Yeah.
292000	294720	It's like they had like a giant doctor who TARDIS cardboard thing.
294720	297480	And the cake topper is them.
297480	298480	Yes.
298480	299480	Yeah.
299480	301400	Is it might be Amy and what's his name?
301400	304840	I think they're, yeah, it's kind of like, he's got red hair and TRS got red hair.
304840	305840	Exactly.
305840	306840	He's got his doctor who characters.
306840	312400	Well, you can read more about it at geek-life.com because Tiara does a series called Bride and
312400	315200	the Geek or is it Beauty and the Geek?
315200	317680	Now I sound like a terrible person because I don't know the name.
317680	322120	I think it's Beauty and the Geek, actually, but it's about them setting up and planning
322120	323120	their wedding.
323120	325800	And I thought it was a really cute series, even if the name escapes me right now, because
325800	327960	I'm under pressure.
327960	330120	But Dark Sakura will be back next week.
330120	333520	But we can certainly understand she wanted to go to the bachelorette party, which looked
333520	335560	like it was last night.
335560	339040	And I think they checked into a chocolate place.
339040	343520	So you know, with girls, if they're not going to go see the stripper thing and do that,
343520	345680	what do girls love more than strippers?
345680	346680	Chocolate.
346680	350920	So it makes sense that they would go to a chocolate place of which I guess there is
350920	354360	one in Vegas.
354360	355360	Let's see.
355360	359360	Immortal King in our chat room says Dark Sakura too busy dodging the bouquet.
359360	361520	You know, Dark Sakura is married.
361520	364040	She's talked about her husband, Dan, several times on the show.
364040	367920	I believe that makes you ineligible to even go out to the floor when they ask where the
367920	372760	single ladies put your hands up, you know, so Dark Sakura would not qualify to catch
372760	374320	the bouquet.
374320	380300	I will point out that I did catch the garter at a wedding a couple of years ago.
380300	382300	That was when Mel and Mel got married.
382300	383960	I caught the garter.
383960	386120	So still waiting.
386120	391000	That's all right, I've caught the garter before too.
391000	400040	All right, um, let's see, uh, also in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, um, Tiger
400040	405040	Claw says, what Sky is trying to say is tonight's show is a sausage fest, maybe, but we will
405040	408840	open it up to callers later on and maybe some lovely ladies will call in.
408840	413000	Cause I know we do have some gals that listen to OLR or maybe we'll get some emails or some
413000	416320	tweets from all genders later on.
416320	417320	So we'll find out.
417320	420400	We'll probably just get Jim Sally.
420400	422080	Jim Sally does have a baby girl.
422080	426960	Maybe, maybe she'll get on the line and say, or something, whatever babies say.
426960	427960	All right.
427960	428960	Anyhow.
428960	431400	Um, we always like to start off the show with a kickoff topic.
431400	435640	I don't have anything too serious tonight, but I do have one thing that has been dominating
435640	444180	the gaming world this week, especially if you're a PC gamer, steam sale.
444180	445180	That's right.
445180	451920	I want to talk about how has the steam sale damaged your life or your wallet steam sale
451920	452920	going on.
452920	454640	I believe it ends tomorrow.
454640	458400	I don't know if that means tomorrow at 10 AM and it's done or if that means there's
458400	462320	like one last final hurrah where everything goes on sale or something.
462320	463320	I don't know.
463320	467760	I got my meta achievement of voting on the community's choice every day, the sale.
467760	470000	So that means today's last day.
470000	471000	That's that.
471000	474720	Well, it says prices through the 23rd so I think today's sales are going to run through
474720	479600	like 2 PM tomorrow and then I think it's going to be over right then it's over from yesterday
479600	483920	that expired in eight hours from when I bought them earlier.
483920	488880	Um, so probably, yeah, through tomorrow.
488880	494720	So I wanted to go around and see how did the steam sale wreck your wallet this week?
494720	497600	Uh, Loki, how did the steam sale wreck your wallet?
497600	502120	Well, before I had purchased Skyrim and Borderlands, um, actually it was pretty good this week.
502120	506280	I almost bought, um, Earth Defense Force, Instinct Armageddon, but then I remembered
506280	512840	how much I'd, it was a fun game, but it's not worth owning twice unlike, you know, Earth
512840	517160	Defense Force 2017, which I owned a lot of times.
517160	526280	Um, and then I bought Arma 2, uh, the, uh, the pack they had, it was with, uh, Arma 2
526280	529280	and the expansion for like 20 bucks.
529280	538920	So I got that, almost, I almost considered Sandrais, but I don't want to, um, so we'll
538920	539920	see.
539920	541440	Um, I think, I think that's all I was going to get.
541440	545520	I almost bought Orange Box, but once again, you know, I just don't see myself playing
545520	546520	through Half Life.
546520	550680	I know it's a good game, but I just, when I had the Orange Box, I played Portal and
550680	552120	that was pretty much it.
552120	555420	Although Team Fortress 2 I hear is good, but that's free, so I don't really need the Orange
555420	556420	Box for that.
556420	561680	Um, but yeah, so Arma 2 is only the new thing that I bought, but, uh, I'm looking forward
561680	566120	to checking out DayZ, which is that zombie, uh, thing that they've got.
566120	569840	It's supposed to be all sorts of craziness and boring at the same time.
569840	573200	Isn't the Orange Box have like every Half Life thing in it?
573200	577760	Yeah, it's Half Life, Half Life 2 Episode 1 and Episode 2 and, well, and then the original
577760	583200	game, and then, uh, Portal and Team Fortress 2, but I don't need to play through Portal
583200	584760	again because I've played through that a few times.
584760	588440	I'm pretty sure Alan would tell you Half Life is the best thing you're gonna get.
588440	592620	It's really, I play Half Life 2 and the episodes like twice a year.
592620	597080	But they, the thing is with that is they mark this stuff down all the time, so it's not
597080	599160	like, ooh, I missed my only opportunity for this.
599160	604400	I mean, seriously, they mark this stuff down all the time and I'm sure if I go to a GameStop
604400	608200	or something like that, I'm sure they got a copy of the Orange Box on PC or even Half
608200	614000	Life 2 just sitting there rotting that I could probably take off their hands for, you know,
614000	615000	nothing.
615000	619880	Let me ask a completely random, tangible question because we were talking about Half Life and,
619880	626200	you know, I know that it seems like Valve is trolling you with Half Life 3, right Alan?
626200	631560	Either Half Life 3 or Half Life 2 Episode 3, whatever they wanna do.
631560	633320	But it seems like nothing's ever gonna happen, right?
633320	639880	Yeah, it's now been longer from Half Life Episode 2 today to current day than it was
639880	642040	from Half Life 1 to Half Life 2.
642040	646080	Do you worry that if, you know, Half Life 3 ever does come out at some point that it's
646080	651480	gonna be like Diablo 3 and what I mean by that is, I think most people, not all, but
651480	656520	most people kinda consider Diablo 3 a letdown for a variety of reasons, be it that auction
656520	659440	house or the lack of, you know, offline play or something.
659440	663600	I think the only reason why there hasn't been Half Life 3 is because they need to develop
663600	664600	a new engine.
664600	667920	I mean, they've been using the Source engine forever now, so it's time that they come out
667920	669640	with a new engine.
669640	674360	But let me go back to the question for Alan, do you worry that Half Life 3 may end up being
674360	676360	a disappointment?
676360	683160	Well, it kinda reminds me, you know the series Lost and how weird it was and there was a,
683160	686960	some of the fans were like, they totally know how it's gonna end and the other half of the
686960	690920	fans were like, they're making this shit up as they go along.
690920	696800	Half Life, I'm afraid the story might get too big for them to reign in and the story
696800	702200	might be weird, but otherwise, I mean, it's just gonna be a first person shooter.
702200	707440	It's Valve, Valve's pedigree is very high, so I don't really expect them to drop the
707440	709760	ball that much on it.
709760	713440	Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com seems to agree with Loki.
713440	718040	I think Half Life 3 will come out if and only if they create a new engine for their games.
718040	719600	They need a Source 2.
719600	722360	I think they are gonna create a new engine for their game because it's getting dated.
722360	726320	But I mean, it's good, they make good games and the engine still looks pretty nice, but
726320	730840	it's just, they're gonna need to come out with something at some point.
730840	734000	I mean, it's gonna have to happen because it's gonna get dated.
734000	739800	Yeah, because Source as it is, which it's the first generation of it was 2003 or 2004
739800	742800	when Half Life 2 came out, it's been updated four or five times.
742800	743800	Yeah.
743800	746240	But it's still the core engine.
746240	747520	Is that what's running Portal 2?
747520	748520	Yes.
748520	749520	Wow.
749520	752280	Yes, it's a modified Source and Left 4 Dead 2 is also a modified Source.
752280	755560	Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 are both, they both still look great, but I understand the
755560	756560	desire to...
756560	759280	It's the physics and stuff.
759280	760280	That's all the same.
760280	764000	Maybe Valve is waiting for the next wave of consoles, maybe at this point don't make a
764000	765000	PlayStation 3 game.
765000	767600	They just need to come out with a game that's just all the Source games kind of combined
767600	768600	in the one.
768600	770440	You got a little bit of Half Life, you got a little bit of Portal in there, a little
770440	774440	bit of Left 4 Dead, just a mix, you know, just a mixing of everything.
774440	776560	A little bit of Team Fortress 2.
776560	782600	Half Life 2 Episode 3 was supposed to heavily involve Aperture Science.
782600	790600	And because Portal was such a huge hit, it almost makes me wonder if they want to keep
790600	793120	those worlds separate now.
793120	797960	Because you're supposed to go up to like the North Pole or the South Pole to find the ship
797960	798960	and blah, blah, blah.
798960	803000	So yeah, Aperture Science was supposed to be in Episode 3 and now I don't know if they're
803000	804640	trying to write their way around that.
804640	807760	Because of all the story in Portal 2 about Aperture Science, certainly.
807760	808760	Yeah.
808760	811040	That could be an interesting monkey wrench.
811040	813520	Anyhow, I didn't mean to get us too far on the tangent.
813520	816720	Let's go back to how Steam Sale wrecked your week.
816720	818720	Anything else, Loki, that you bought on the sale?
818720	819720	No, that was it.
819720	821000	Just those three games.
821000	822560	I'll go.
822560	829480	I bought Civilization V for Alan because just like how I bully him into coming on this show,
829480	834160	clearly, I'm going to talk to him about playing Civ V with me.
834160	835160	Aren't you excited?
835160	836160	Yes.
836160	837160	I installed it.
837160	838160	Hooray!
838160	839160	That's progress.
839160	845480	I bought Civ V Gods and Kings for myself because it was like 20% off, which I figured for a
845480	848720	game that's only like two months old is probably as low as it's going to get.
848720	849960	So I bought that.
849960	855680	And I bought a four-pack of Dungeon Defenders because it was cheap and I heard it's kind
855680	857000	of good, so I bought that.
857000	859200	Why'd you buy four of them?
859200	862040	So that I could give Alan one and I gave one to another.
862040	863040	I gave one to Shane.
863040	864640	What is Dungeon Defenders anyway?
864640	866280	I haven't decided what I'm doing with the fourth one yet.
866280	868080	It's co-op tower defense, I think.
868080	869840	That sounds fun.
869840	870840	Do you not have it, Loki?
870840	871840	I don't have it.
871840	872840	Well, now you do.
872840	873840	There's my fourth copy.
873840	874840	There you go.
874840	875840	Sweet.
875840	876840	I bought it for Loki.
876840	877840	I did it for you, bro.
877840	878840	Thank you.
878840	879840	All right.
879840	880840	There you go.
880840	881840	That's one genre I haven't really gotten into.
881840	882840	Tower defense stuff.
882840	883840	Well, actually, I guess I have.
883840	889040	I play the stick war games on the IOS, but I kind of, I don't know, it'd be fun.
889040	890040	All right.
890040	891040	And I'm trying to think.
891040	892040	There was something else.
892040	893040	Oh, yeah.
893040	895160	I bought Skyrim, which I think I talked about on last week's show.
895160	899920	My memory's a little fuzzy, but I bought Skyrim on PC just because I wanted to be able to
899920	900920	mod it.
900920	906120	And, you know, I had it on PlayStation 3, but it's just not, it's not PC.
906120	912200	And I got to say, after installing that high res texture pack and everything, very nice,
912200	915040	very nice, very nice looking game.
915040	919280	And all the mods are very cool and the Steam Workshop, and it's very easy to get that stuff
919280	920280	in there.
920280	922180	And Alan, Alan's great.
922180	924960	He sent me an email saying like, okay, here are the must have mods.
924960	927520	You need this and this and this and this, and he just gave me a list.
927520	933680	All quality of life stuff, like the default UI for inventory and spells is shit.
933680	936220	So here's a mod that makes it pretty.
936220	940960	Tiger Claw, who's participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com says, can your PC run
940960	942360	Skyrim fine?
942360	943940	Yeah, it's running great.
943940	948680	I don't think it's like the highest, highest settings, but my video card's fairly new.
948680	952600	It's only about a year old and, you know, I have a fairly powerful PC.
952600	953600	It's just very loud.
953600	957240	That's the only problem with my PC is that when the fans are running, you should hear
957240	958600	mine because it's under the desk.
958600	959600	That's why it's muted.
959600	960600	Mine's a beast.
960600	964640	Your PC is way better than mine and I run games fine, so you shouldn't have a problem.
964640	969000	My PC at home, I need to upgrade everything on it because, you know, it was back when
969000	973400	the 8800, you know, Nvidia cards were new.
973400	983840	So I have a dual 8800 GTS 512s running SLI and have a dual core because it was a core
983840	987860	2 dual before they had all these i5s, i7s and stuff like that.
987860	991920	But it's overclocked to almost 4 gigs.
991920	997560	But it's still, you know, those cards kind of hold it back.
997560	1003480	Bobby Blackwolf who tapes before us at 5 o'clock Pacific 8 Eastern at VODnetwork.com every
1003480	1007920	Sunday night is sending a link that he, I saw your tweet on this earlier, Bobby.
1007920	1008920	That's how I know what this is.
1008920	1015840	It's the Minecraft mod for Skyrim that actually changes your companion to Steve the Minecraft
1015840	1016840	dude and all that.
1016840	1022320	I'm just afraid once I do start modding this is it's going to get weird really fast because
1022320	1026200	I'm going to have to get, you know, the macho man dragon mod.
1026200	1028320	Oh, I got to get that still.
1028320	1030880	Thank you for reminding me.
1030880	1037200	That one also, a quick, I guess a, we actually have somebody in chat too named macho man,
1037200	1038840	so maybe you'll get an, oh yeah.
1038840	1044720	So there's also, you know, the, in case you're not a macho man fan, they have the My Little
1044720	1049640	Pony ones that turn the dragons into that and the extra magic, the extra magic one is
1049640	1050640	pretty cool.
1050640	1053400	They have different, let's just be real.
1053400	1055160	It's for the weed smokers.
1055160	1060600	They have, they have the Brony mod for the weed smokers.
1060600	1062760	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1062760	1064280	I'm just saying.
1064280	1068580	I just want to see what kind of, I mean it's going to look nothing like that.
1068580	1069580	That's the fun of it.
1069580	1070580	Like I've played Skyrim.
1070580	1073600	Skyrim is fun and I'm still playing it on 360.
1073600	1077040	I haven't, I haven't picked up DLC cause I think it's a waste of money right now.
1077040	1081980	But um, I just want to make the PC version look nothing like the original game and just
1081980	1085360	have it be frigging crazy.
1085360	1088360	Just batshit crazy.
1088360	1092820	Black Wolf is also asking in chat, can Alan post his essential Skyrim mod list to the
1092820	1093820	forums?
1093820	1097840	Well, I've actually been trying to nudge him into doing an article for the site on that.
1097840	1099500	Nudge, nudge, nudge, nudge.
1099500	1101360	Can I talk about the steam workshop?
1101360	1102360	Yes sir.
1102360	1108280	As someone who likes to mod PC games, the steam workshop is amazing and how incredibly
1108280	1110800	easy it is to just install a mod.
1110800	1112860	And if you don't like it, it's gone.
1112860	1115140	It's like a one click process within steam.
1115140	1120800	The problem that I have with it is that a lot of really awesome mod authors aren't on
1120800	1125980	it just because they don't, they're fine with nexus, which was the old school modding site.
1125980	1130600	So there's a lot of amazing Skyrim mods, especially UI and quality of life stuff that isn't on
1130600	1132020	the steam workshop.
1132020	1137600	So if I make a list, I can say, here's how you install stuff from nexus, but here's the
1137600	1138840	easy stuff from steam workshop.
1138840	1139840	I don't know.
1139840	1141220	I think it's okay.
1141220	1144680	I have faith that most of our listeners could figure it out.
1144680	1150620	Well, yeah, a lot of people are intimidated by modding and the steam workshop is absolutely,
1150620	1153740	it's an amazing progression.
1153740	1158300	It's very innovative on that stuff, but it's kind of split the community up a bit because
1158300	1160160	now there's two different sources for mods.
1160160	1164420	ActDeft is trying to share this mod that he says I should get called the Yay mod.
1164420	1166700	He says, screw the Macho Man mod, get the Yay mod.
1166700	1167980	And I'm like, dear God, what is that?
1167980	1168980	And he sent me a YouTube.
1168980	1174220	Usually I don't play YouTube on the show without looking at them first, but for Yay mod, I'll
1174220	1175500	take a risk.
1175500	1177500	ActDeft don't ruin my show.
1177500	1178500	Here we go.
1178500	1179500	Let's see.
1179500	1187340	So the guys in the dungeon, see what happens.
1187340	1191140	If you don't know the elements of good cheer yet, you should try out these cheat codes.
1191140	1193740	I don't know what that's going to do.
1193740	1195220	All right.
1195220	1196940	ActDeft when does this get good?
1196940	1199260	Oh, the guy's typing it in.
1199260	1201260	Let's see what happens.
1201260	1208540	I think it was only a minute and a half long.
1208540	1211460	Come on.
1211460	1213420	Okay.
1213420	1219540	Nothing good's happening.
1219540	1223460	ActDeft you should have just gave you a timestamp and said, bump it to like a minute, five
1223460	1229180	five.
1229180	1235860	I'm more interested in this because everything's in German right now.
1235860	1238500	I'm sure dragon shouts in German are terrifying.
1238500	1247420	I just realized it says my little pony friendship is magic in the title, so I'm a little worried.
1247420	1251180	I might need to smoke a little bit of something before this will actually make sense.
1251180	1255340	Is that the trick?
1255340	1258060	It's probably a dragon shout that's my little pony.
1258060	1261540	There's now a dragon shout that says yay.
1261540	1268980	Now to the fun part with 10 seconds left in the video.
1268980	1269980	That's it?
1269980	1270980	Yay.
1270980	1276940	Oh, and I give that on a scale of one to 10, about a 1.5.
1276940	1278780	Sorry, ActDeft.
1278780	1280540	That was the stoppage of the show.
1280540	1285900	And Bobby Black Wolf in chat said, Wolf rather, that he's installed mods from Nexus.
1285900	1293060	Nexus does have its own little Nexus mod manager app, but a lot of people are like, I don't
1293060	1297120	want to install this five meg little weird ass app.
1297120	1302700	So it kind of has a Steam Workshop alternative, but yeah, I can post all that to the forums.
1302700	1303700	Sounds good.
1303700	1304700	Yeah.
1304700	1308460	Oh, and another thing about the Steam Workshop, and this is because I'm a huge pervert.
1308460	1314820	Sometimes mods, modders, especially in like the Grand Theft Auto franchise, like to make
1314820	1319260	people naked or make their clothes really slutty, even if you strip them and they still
1319260	1324740	have underwear on, just like cleavage and the big boobs, that stuff's not on Steam Workshop.
1324740	1330940	So if you want an NC-17 R-rated Skyrim, like I do, you're going to want to go to Nexus
1330940	1331940	for that.
1331940	1336220	Hey man, they do some good work on Lydia.
1336220	1341300	Yeah, there's a bunch of Lydia mods where it's not appropriate for this show.
1341300	1345900	That's what we're talking about, this show is appropriate for everything.
1345900	1347820	This isn't the Bobby Black Wolf show, Alan.
1347820	1352180	They have some deep cleavage for those characters.
1352180	1357580	All right, Alan, what was the damage for you this week, because I know you went shopping.
1357580	1363100	Oh yeah, I think from the very first day of the sale, I think it's dinged me collectively
1363100	1370660	for, I want to say 50 or 55 bucks, but it's $3.50 here, $8.99 here.
1370660	1377780	The big thing that I got was Saints Row 3 was knocked down to like $7.49 and then that
1377780	1381820	plus all of the DLC, all of it, I think was like $22.99.
1381820	1384700	So I picked that up, just inhaled all that down.
1384700	1392020	Spoiler, most of the DLC sucks, actually spoiler, all of the DLC sucks.
1392020	1397260	One thing I noticed, and you're the one who pointed this out, there's the daily sales
1397260	1398940	that actually last about two hours.
1398940	1403340	There are the flash sales and then there are the community vote sales.
1403340	1409420	Those prices have been cycling through every day or like twice a day every other day for
1409420	1410680	the whole sale.
1410680	1414100	It's a genius move on Valve's part because it makes it look like they're putting all
1414100	1418880	this stuff constantly on sale, but all it is, they have the daily sales and the votes
1418880	1423380	and the flash sales are just the same things as the daily sales, just cycling through at
1423380	1424380	random intervals.
1424380	1425380	It's genius.
1425380	1428580	If the thing that you voted on for the community sale didn't win, it's probably going to be
1428580	1432300	a part of the daily sale the next day or the day after, or it'll be one of the flash sales
1432300	1433300	at the bottom.
1433300	1434940	So you're going to get that game.
1434940	1438500	Well, remember that for Christmas because it's too late now.
1438500	1441500	Because remember when Civ 5, I think, was like, what, eight bucks?
1441500	1443600	And people were like, fuck, I missed Civ 5 for eight bucks.
1443600	1447220	It's been eight bucks like three separate times since that you said that.
1447220	1450980	So they keep bringing those prices back and making us think they're unique.
1450980	1453140	All right.
1453140	1456920	So I think we've talked enough about our Steam addiction this week and the stuff we've bought.
1456920	1460320	Let's get into a similar topic because it's how we always start the show.
1460320	1462500	How was your gaming week?
1462500	1463500	What?
1463500	1465540	Because the Steam sale is just about buying a bunch of games.
1465540	1467100	It doesn't mean you're going to play them.
1467100	1469140	So what did you actually play this week?
1469140	1470140	How was your gaming week?
1470140	1471140	Sorry.
1471140	1473460	I had to make one more purchase here real quick.
1473460	1474460	Oh, God.
1474460	1475460	What happened?
1475460	1476460	Just Cause 2 is $3.74.
1476460	1478700	That game is fucking awesome.
1478700	1482460	And for $3.74, I have to buy that.
1482460	1483460	Feed Gabe Newell.
1483460	1484460	Feed him.
1484460	1485460	I can't stop.
1485460	1489900	See, like, before, like, was it the stupid indie?
1489900	1494100	I blame the humble indie bundles because, God damn it, I didn't have Steam and all this
1494100	1495540	shit before that.
1495540	1499500	And now, and now I'm sucked into this.
1499500	1500500	All right.
1500500	1503100	Well, I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but I am going to say pause for a minute
1503100	1504540	and tell us about your gaming week first.
1504540	1505540	All right.
1505540	1506540	All right.
1506540	1507540	Thanks.
1507540	1512100	So this week, I played Borderlands because I picked it up on the Steam sale on PC.
1512100	1516060	So I've been kind of going back and replaying that again since I want to kind of remember
1516060	1521980	a little bit what happens for the, you know, sequel so that I can, you know, bust that
1521980	1524740	out when it comes out in September.
1524740	1527420	And it's fun.
1527420	1528420	I like it.
1528420	1530640	And of course, I went ahead and modded it again.
1530640	1532900	It's been a while since I've actually played that game.
1532900	1536700	So they've patched it a few more times and you can't do some of the really cool guns
1536700	1538080	that you had before.
1538080	1543700	But there's still, like, some pretty awesome ones in there that you can mod.
1543700	1544700	So I have some of those.
1544700	1547420	I have a pistol now that takes people's heads off and stuff.
1547420	1548660	Oh, how pleasant.
1548660	1553460	It just makes them explode, it's like, hi, mirror gun.
1553460	1554460	So there's that.
1554460	1559620	And then, let's see, besides Borderlands, I actually finished, I was installing a bunch
1559620	1560620	of stuff.
1560620	1566260	I have I Wanna Be The Guy, the original, played a little bit of that, just like maybe 15 minutes
1566260	1567260	of it.
1567260	1570860	And then I Wanna Be The Guy, I played a little bit of that.
1570860	1576740	The only thing I don't like about it, and I'm sure this is on purpose, is like the little,
1576740	1582340	they have this sort of Super Mario World world select screen or whatever that, of course,
1582340	1585700	you can die in because, you know, I want to be the guy.
1585700	1589460	And I don't like the fact that you can't stop moving in that because it's, you know, you
1589460	1593060	push left to right and your guy just keeps walking and there's a spot where you have
1593060	1597860	to kind of sit still before, you know, you do something.
1597860	1601540	So it's a little annoying, but I'm sure it's like that on purpose.
1601540	1606220	Then I played a little bit of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, we played the new terminal
1606220	1610820	map that they had, which was kind of a remake from Modern Warfare 2.
1610820	1614320	And it's a great map, so we've been enjoying that quite a bit.
1614320	1618200	Haven't really been practicing too much for the tournament coming up, although I have
1618200	1623780	been playing my class that I'm going to be using for the tournament because, like I mentioned
1623780	1628440	last week, I'm going to be entering a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 tournament one, almost
1628440	1629500	a week from today.
1629500	1633060	It's next Saturday, so I'm looking forward to that.
1633060	1634060	That'll be kind of fun.
1634060	1637580	Driving down to Stockton for those.
1637580	1638780	That's next week?
1638780	1639780	That's next week.
1639780	1640780	It's going to be a big week next week.
1640780	1641780	Yeah.
1641780	1642780	Excited.
1642780	1643780	I was going to do that.
1643780	1650700	Minecraft's been playing my new world I started with my coworker, and we've been playing that
1650700	1653140	just on Easy.
1653140	1656500	And it's kind of a different type of game.
1656500	1665540	I created a mob drowning machine thing, so it drowns some of the mobs and some of them
1665540	1667540	get through.
1667540	1669180	But it's kind of interesting.
1669180	1678660	And I don't know, just I think that was about, oh, I had been selling some stuff on eBay.
1678660	1683080	I guess I must have bought something on eBay not too long ago because I had like $6 worth
1683080	1692300	of, it was like $6.60 in eBay bucks that they have you earn like, I don't remember what
1692300	1695160	the ratio is, but you're in like free money basically.
1695160	1700820	So I was bored one day, I'm like, okay, I never really spend these, so I'm going to
1700820	1704660	find something that's gaming related under $6.60.
1704660	1707840	I'm going to try to find the best value for my money.
1707840	1713820	And so I was searching around and I actually found a digital copy of Child of Eden for
1713820	1715780	$6.
1715780	1718540	So I picked that up because that's a no brainer.
1718540	1723820	So hopefully I'll get back to playing that on the 360 again.
1723820	1728260	And I think that's all I played this week.
1728260	1729260	Awesome.
1729260	1732300	I'll go next because I didn't play a lot of new games this week.
1732300	1735500	I mean, I think I talked about most of the stuff in the Steam sale.
1735500	1738020	I didn't play enough Dungeon Defenders to really review it yet.
1738020	1739860	So I'll come back to that next week.
1739860	1744180	I did play a little bit of Civ V Gods and Kings, but I didn't, like, you know, you have
1744180	1747060	to really book out a chunk of time to play that game.
1747060	1750340	And I started playing it and I didn't really have a whole lot of time and I was playing
1750340	1751340	sloppy.
1751340	1756140	And for some reason I decided to go for a military victory and I never do military victories.
1756140	1758660	And I was spreading myself too thin on all fronts.
1758660	1763420	So I was getting my butt kicked on like an easy level and I was like, forget it, stop,
1763420	1764420	delete.
1764420	1765420	I'll come back to this later.
1765420	1766420	So yeah.
1766420	1768860	Didn't really get to do a whole lot there.
1768860	1773940	Played a little bit of WoW, played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 online on PC.
1773940	1775780	And I got to admit, I'm a little disappointed.
1775780	1777620	I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.
1777620	1778620	You all know.
1778620	1779620	Go ahead.
1779620	1783260	Double fold, there's two reasons, well, one reason for me, two reasons for you on why
1783260	1786020	it's shitty and why you're not going to play it anymore.
1786020	1789720	Well, I don't know, like I'm threatening not to play it anymore, but I think we all know
1789720	1794580	somebody will be like, please come play with me and I'll be like, okay.
1794580	1798980	But I'm just, I'm really frustrated and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.
1798980	1804740	Origin, and I hate to say this because I know people that work at Origin, but it's not good.
1804740	1808500	Like I'm sorry, I can't, I'm really frustrated with it.
1808500	1810340	And a lot of it has to do with connection issues.
1810340	1814420	I'm consistently having on Origin and this whole, Alan, you can explain it better than
1814420	1819420	I can, the two, two people in one place can't battle two people in another place.
1819420	1824380	So a very obvious four person setup, couple and couple playing the game together.
1824380	1825380	It won't, yeah.
1825380	1826380	It won't do it.
1826380	1827380	Origin won't let you do it.
1827380	1828380	Yeah.
1828380	1829380	Cause we're, we play on NAT via router.
1829380	1831420	We just have the one IP and that's cool.
1831420	1836360	Rob and myself can go in, we can play our own separate matches.
1836360	1841540	We can do co-op with two public pugs that we let in through the like the public match.
1841540	1842540	That's fine.
1842540	1850780	But Origin, it's network kernel can only keep track of one IP with two sessions on it.
1850780	1853260	It can't do it for another IP with two sessions on it.
1853260	1857980	So when we try to play with our friends who are in the exact same setup as us, the third
1857980	1859620	person could get, could get on.
1859620	1862740	But when the fourth person tries, they time out.
1862740	1866820	Or if the match is already in progress, it will time out the person at their house while
1866820	1868020	the fourth person tries to get in.
1868020	1873940	I know this makes no sense at this point, but yeah, it's TLDR, it's shitty.
1873940	1878580	It's shitty and it's peer to peer, which is why it has this problem XBLA and I think PSN
1878580	1880820	is all server based.
1880820	1884260	So the matching service on Mass Effect 3 is, is peer to peer and that's why it has all
1884260	1885260	these problems.
1885260	1889300	And let me tell you what I've had to put up with to play what is otherwise a great game.
1889300	1895180	Again, I don't get into online shooter games ever, but Mass Effect 3, which isn't really
1895180	1898160	a shooter, but it kind of is, like it has defied that trend.
1898160	1903980	But what I have to do to play this fucking game on Origin, log into the game, wait while
1903980	1905780	it connects to Origin.
1905780	1908260	Okay, game is connected to Origin.
1908260	1914480	Now the menu is up, wait while it loads my galacticness ready, readiness rating or whatever
1914480	1915480	it's called.
1915480	1919460	Okay, now select multiplayer, wait for multiplayer to load.
1919460	1921180	All right, let me connect to my friend.
1921180	1922180	Wait to connect to the friend.
1922180	1925300	It takes like four minutes to get into a freaking match.
1925300	1929140	I bet what it's doing for those first two big lags when it opens up the galactic, I
1929140	1933460	bet that's all like the DRM, Origin security stuff going through.
1933460	1934700	It's gotta be.
1934700	1935740	Which is ridiculous.
1935740	1941660	Like it's stopped, like do it once, do it once every 10 connections just to stop bogging
1941660	1944100	my game down because it's really ruining it for me.
1944100	1949060	And then what really just set me over the edge was that we played a game the other night.
1949060	1950540	It was me, you and our friend Tim.
1950540	1954180	We were three manning some bronze maps, which we can do to full extraction.
1954180	1955440	And we were playing those online.
1955440	1958860	We played two matches and I got about 30,000 credits.
1958860	1963540	I leveled one guy from 19 to 20 and another, my engineer from like one to six.
1963540	1965740	Yeah, lost all that.
1965740	1970700	After I disconnected from the match, lost it all, rolled back, wrote EA customer support.
1970700	1971980	Please give me back what I lost.
1971980	1974420	I got a reply back, sorry, can't do that.
1974420	1976220	No, you can do it.
1976220	1980140	You don't want to because you think I'm trying to, you know, get it from you or steal it
1980140	1981140	from you.
1981140	1982140	This is ridiculous.
1982140	1983140	And I'm kind of over it.
1983140	1984140	Yeah.
1984140	1986900	Xbox has its share of connection problems too, honestly.
1986900	1991500	Cause with Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, aside from the galactic readiness and the first
1991500	1994580	player part of it, there's the challenge.
1994580	1999800	But then aside from the challenge of shooting shit, you get credits and you buy these goodie
1999800	2002100	packs and you unlock new characters.
2002100	2005860	That's why people play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is because they want to play as a Vortia.
2005860	2007940	They want to play as an Asari.
2007940	2013100	So if you're not getting your credits, that's, that's why you're playing is to buy it unless
2013100	2015300	you want to get Bioware points, but.
2015300	2020980	Which I refuse to, and then I have saved up for so many of these packs and then this gets
2020980	2023460	into a little bit of like, you know, it's not fair.
2023460	2024460	The game's not fair.
2024460	2028060	I have yet, I've unlocked two characters out of like the 40 there is.
2028060	2032340	And the way you unlock stuff is ridiculous because it's all RNG.
2032340	2036380	You buy a goodie box and then pray you get the shit you want in it.
2036380	2038780	And it's totally random.
2038780	2043860	So Osfer says in our chat room, just calm down and play the game on 360 after the show
2043860	2044860	tonight.
2044860	2046100	We'll have a proper multiplayer game.
2046100	2047100	Yeah, I can play it on PC.
2047100	2048580	You can play it on 360.
2048580	2049580	Maybe.
2049580	2053420	I mean, I'm not saying no to like playing games on 360, but like all these issues, no
2053420	2056940	matter what platform, I'm kind of like over Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and I'm ready for
2056940	2060580	a new game and I'm ready for some single player content.
2060580	2063540	That's why we're going to play Borderlands, maybe.
2063540	2064540	Maybe.
2064540	2065540	Or Civ V, maybe.
2065540	2072540	You do realize Borderlands 2, you can play split screen on one Xbox 360 system and then
2072540	2076420	also with that split screen play against other people.
2076420	2080820	You know, we can do co-op and you can both play on the same TV.
2080820	2084460	Come to Borderlands 2.
2084460	2086260	I want to check out Borderlands 1 again.
2086260	2089340	I only played it a little bit before and got distracted, so yeah, I'll definitely check
2089340	2090340	that out.
2090340	2091340	Fantastic.
2091340	2092340	Yeah.
2092340	2096940	So, um, yeah, that's my little like origin rant and just, it's, it's, it's set me as
2096940	2103580	it is setting EA as a company back, but of course EA is doing it to themselves.
2103580	2107740	So you know, what can you do?
2107740	2111460	So um, let's see, I guess that's it for my gaming week.
2111460	2112460	I've ran it enough.
2112460	2113460	Alan, how about you?
2113460	2119140	Um, Mass Effect 3, we already talked about that plenty, so I'm not going to get into
2119140	2120140	that.
2120140	2122900	LA Noire, which I've been playing, I'm almost near the end.
2122900	2127720	I kind of want to beat it, not because it's boring, but I am using a FAQ so I can get
2127720	2131500	everything the first time through and just follow the narrative of it.
2131500	2136100	And with the FAQ, that game's kind of boring, whereas other games, if you follow a FAQ,
2136100	2141700	you still have the, the mechanics of it keeping it fun.
2141700	2145660	So a shitload of LA Noire, um, thanks to the Steam sale, it was dirt cheap.
2145660	2151300	So I got it for like 10, 12 bucks with it and all the DLC cases, um, enjoying that.
2151300	2154820	Uh, I was playing Saints Row the third.
2154820	2159180	I'm on the mission where you parachute onto the top of the building and Kanye West is
2159180	2160180	playing.
2160180	2168340	Yeah, that's, it's like an hour or so or so in, um, played a lot with the character creator,
2168340	2170660	um, in that, uh, oh,
2170660	2172940	Oh, you have that game on PC, right?
2172940	2173940	Yeah.
2173940	2174940	Yeah.
2174940	2176420	You might check a gentleman of the row.
2176420	2180780	They have a lot of cool enhancements and stuff for both Saints Row two and Saints Row the
2180780	2181780	third.
2181780	2185300	Have you been, uh, have you been laughing your ass off at Saints Row three?
2185300	2187300	Like I was especially that parachuting thing.
2187300	2188300	Yeah.
2188300	2189300	It was funny.
2189300	2191500	Cause you throw Shonda, you're just like, I'll catch you later.
2191500	2192540	She's like, I'm dying.
2192540	2195680	We're falling towards the ground and yeah.
2195680	2197660	And people are shooting at you with no, no parachutes on.
2197660	2200780	They're killing themselves trying to kill you.
2200780	2206980	Um, I installed a game that I hadn't played in a couple of years, postal two for anyone
2206980	2213420	who remembers that it's actually, it's a really, it's incredibly vulgar and offensive in a
2213420	2216420	lot of ways, but it's a first person shooter.
2216420	2220340	It's, you know, data it's seven days of the week I got the expansion.
2220340	2222720	So I was playing postal two for some reason.
2222720	2227860	I'm like, I just want to play a really offensive, awful first person shooter.
2227860	2232700	I think, Oh, um, I guess I'll make this a part of my gaming week.
2232700	2239540	I decided to check out my PSP, my slim, which is, um, got custom firmware on it.
2239540	2242860	Just to see if there are any custom firmware updates, keep, you know, up to date, maybe
2242860	2245340	check out some of the UMDs I have.
2245340	2252700	And I noticed when I turned it on that there's this weird spotting discoloration splotches
2252700	2257260	around the border of my screen and I Googled it and it turns out this is a known issue
2257260	2261420	for older PSPs and we don't live here in Sacramento.
2261420	2262940	It's like 102 degrees outside right now.
2262940	2267980	I don't live in San Bruno anymore where it's, where it's foggy, but there's, this is a known
2267980	2268980	issue.
2268980	2273920	There's mold under my LCD between the glass and the backlit portion.
2273920	2276540	It's it's, it's just a slight discoloration.
2276540	2280860	If Jamie was here, I'd have her take a picture of it and put it on the flicker stream.
2280860	2283580	Hey, I saw someone else.
2283580	2286040	But I guess, yeah, this is a thing.
2286040	2290940	You get mold under your L it's when I'm actually playing, when I'm actually playing like a
2290940	2297420	bright game, like prep of the rapper, really any game, it's the colors and the movement
2297420	2298800	doesn't really notice.
2298800	2301780	I don't really notice it that much, but on like just the crossbar, the menu screen, I'm
2301780	2303500	like, this sucks.
2303500	2310900	I don't know if it's mold though cause it's, um, it's almost like just this, the LCD screen
2310900	2314980	just kind of going out or something cause you can see if you turn it, it changes the
2314980	2316260	colors and stuff of it.
2316260	2320340	It looks, and it's, Ooh, it's all splotchy.
2320340	2321340	Yeah.
2321340	2322340	Gross.
2322340	2323340	It's like a disease.
2323340	2324340	It looks like your PSP has shingles.
2324340	2325340	You want to put it down.
2325340	2326420	I don't want to get it.
2326420	2331280	So yeah, I've heard people say like, not that this is a fix for it, but someone, I was reading
2331280	2334940	a forum post and someone was like, what if you put it under a UV light for like a day?
2334940	2337900	Well, the UV light kill them, kill the fungus under there.
2337900	2342500	And I'm like, I'm not doing that, but yeah, it's, um, if you have a PSP and it's been
2342500	2345760	in your closet for a year cause you don't play PSP anymore, turn it on and see if it's
2345760	2349900	got weird splotches under it.
2349900	2355100	I got 2000 having a really powered it on a long time.
2355100	2358860	So yeah, my PSP has crud.
2358860	2359860	Wow.
2359860	2360860	It needs antibiotics.
2360860	2364140	You can probably just get a new screen if you want.
2364140	2365140	All right.
2365140	2369240	Well, uh, it's not like you leave that thing in the bathroom.
2369240	2371660	You know, you would like in the bathroom, you might expect to get moldy cause you know,
2371660	2375020	the steam from the shower and all that, you know, in the living room on our shelf.
2375020	2376240	Yeah, that's weird.
2376240	2379060	And when I, when I last turned this on here, it's not even human.
2379060	2382440	When I, I think I turned this on last around Christmas and it was fine.
2382440	2384420	So it's something that's happened within the last six months.
2384420	2385420	Worry about my PSP now.
2385420	2386420	Yeah.
2386420	2389100	Cause that's, it's been years for yours and we need to watch the, or we need to turn on
2389100	2392940	the Vita every couple, you're still watching Netflix on the Vita, right?
2392940	2393940	Yeah.
2393940	2394940	All right.
2394940	2395940	Good.
2395940	2396940	All right.
2396940	2399500	Um, well if that's it for your gaming week, let me get into housekeeping real quick and
2399500	2400500	then we'll get into the news.
2400500	2402780	Um, some quick housekeeping tonight.
2402780	2409220	Um, first off the summer fest for PlayStation home is next week.
2409220	2414420	You can read more about that at the VOG networks website, vog network.com, but we will be live
2414420	2420820	in PlayStation home kind of being there exploring in the Aurora's space and meeting some people
2420820	2423900	virtually as well as broadcasting at the same time.
2423900	2429120	Um, don't worry though if you don't even have a PlayStation three, nothing's going to change
2429120	2430120	for you.
2430120	2433020	You just, you know, you won't be able to participate in going into home, but you're not going to
2433020	2434020	miss anything.
2434020	2436300	We're still broadcasting the way we always do and all that.
2436300	2440460	It's just kind of like we'll have a second chat room and PlayStation home that night,
2440460	2441580	but we're looking forward to it.
2441580	2445900	It's kind of neat cause you get to involve games and the social aspect of it and maybe
2445900	2450560	meet some new listeners and some listeners that want to come into the home space.
2450560	2451560	So it's a lot of fun.
2451560	2455420	Uh, again, that's happening in the Aurora space during next week's Bobby Black Wolf
2455420	2456420	show and our show.

2490900	2497560	It is a beta key for ravaged, ravaged was a Kickstarter funded project and it's now
2497560	2498560	in beta.

2517320	2521080	We're going to give away a beta key to somebody in the chat room who has checked into the
2521080	2525480	website a little later in part B. So stay tuned for that.
2525480	2527600	Uh, I think that's it.
2527600	2530240	I feel like I'm forgetting something, but if I think of it, I'll, I'll come back to
2530240	2531240	it later.
2531240	2533760	So let's get started with tonight's news in the meantime, Loki.
2533760	2539280	So I'm sure this is going to come to a shock to a lot of people, but there's a rumor that
2539280	2544200	final fantasy 13 versus is dead.
2544200	2551640	I know shocking that, you know, a game that we haven't seen much of for six years, um,
2551640	2555260	not coming out, but, uh, yeah.
2555260	2561680	And this is coming from some inside sources, um, that apparently Kotaku is talking to.
2561680	2567400	And they're saying that, you know, it's officially canceled, but I mean, I don't know if it's
2567400	2570920	officially canceled or if it's just going to be retitled.
2570920	2572760	They haven't made a statement, right?
2572760	2575200	There's no been no PR bulletin or anything.
2575200	2576200	Okay.
2576200	2577200	Yeah.
2577200	2580840	It's, it's, uh, the last thing I think it's, we, we're almost done with preparing our latest
2580840	2585160	info for the game because of a totally unrelated reason.
2585160	2589800	There are circumstances in which, uh, that info cannot be released.
2589800	2595780	So info for that game, maybe it's now no longer versus because honestly, 13 verses, it still
2595780	2600280	didn't make any sense to me why it's called that because both games, you know, it looks
2600280	2603040	nothing like final fantasy 13 at all.
2603040	2605180	And there's nothing so far that they've shown us.
2605180	2608240	That's led me to believe that's even in the same universe as 13.
2608240	2612400	I think some of the mythology is supposed to be the same, like the whole lacy and the
2612400	2613400	fallacy and all that.
2613400	2616320	I think it's supposed to be like a constant because it wasn't, I want to say it was a
2616320	2620080	trilogy, but there was the main story and then the two guidance side stories, one for
2620080	2622280	the PSP and then versus 13.
2622280	2623280	Yeah.
2623280	2626160	There's supposed to be some common thread, no matter, regardless of how thin tying it
2626160	2627160	all together.
2627160	2630520	Final fantasy, a guy toe or whatever it was called, excuse me, if I'm butchering that
2630520	2632960	name, it just became fun fancy type zero.
2632960	2638200	So why wouldn't find fancy 13 versus just become something else, which folks are speculating.
2638200	2642840	Including me on this show a couple months ago, I think I said, why don't they just make
2642840	2646840	it final fantasy 15 at this point, it would make a lot of sense because we're starting
2646840	2649920	to get into the next cycle of consoles yet.
2649920	2654020	We're supposed to get, I mean, you know, again, square can do whatever they want, but historically
2654020	2657720	there has always been three final fantasy games on every console.
2657720	2658720	Think about it.
2658720	2662200	One through three was on the NES, even though two and three didn't come out here in America,
2662200	2664860	four or five and six was on the super Nintendo.
2664860	2668480	Even though five didn't come out in North America, but it did later seven, eight, nine,
2668480	2676440	PlayStation one, 10, 11, 12, PlayStation two, 13, 14, 13, two, 13, two.
2676440	2677440	Yeah.
2677440	2683760	So, and technically 14 isn't out on consoles yet, although it's still slated, I mean, 14,
2683760	2689580	or we should say 11, two, because it's basically the 11 characters with their names changed.
2689580	2693280	So they could very well, instead of saying the falsy and lussy or whatever, they could
2693280	2697400	be like, they're the, we're just going to go back to espers.
2697400	2703720	They're espers now, or they're summons or they're, um, I don't know, let's make up another
2703720	2704720	name for summons.
2704720	2707320	Well, they could just, it's final fantasy blank.
2707320	2710320	They could think of a name for it, you know, just like there was final fantasy tactics.
2710320	2714240	It wasn't really a final fantasy game, but kind of in that universe, it was a great game.
2714240	2715380	Was that kind of a name?
2715380	2716680	So I don't know.
2716680	2722520	And you can't count 13, two really as a game in the, I mean, because then you'd have to
2722520	2726040	count 10, two, and then you'd have to count dirge of Cerberus and it throws everything
2726040	2727040	off.
2727040	2728040	So you can't do that.
2728040	2733280	Those are all spin-offs, but I guess we're going to have a definitive answer come what
2733280	2737440	September 1st, because there's supposed to be some Tokyo game show at least by then.
2737440	2740120	Well, square's doing some type of final fantasy.
2740120	2745820	Like they even said, what is next in the final fantasy 13 universe on September 1st.
2745820	2755600	And so either that's versus has a new name or it's, or all of this is proven false because
2755600	2757360	again, it is a rumor.
2757360	2761740	I mean it, you know, it's not like everything Kotaku's ever said has turned out to be true.
2761740	2764240	Think about it.
2764240	2767880	And there's also a possibility and a lot of people are saying, well, what else could they
2767880	2768880	do?
2768880	2774760	But final fantasy 13, three, wouldn't that be something?
2774760	2782360	Which is weird because if it's true that there's a final fantasy 13, three, which would make
2782360	2783360	a lot of sense.
2783360	2785000	I think 13 do did pretty good.
2785000	2788920	It probably wasn't as expensive to make because they made it on the same engine.
2788920	2792120	They had all that DLC for it, which I'm sure made them money too.
2792120	2795360	13, three actually makes a lot of sense for them to do.
2795360	2802660	But it's weird because final fantasy 13 was supposed to be three separate games.
2802660	2808560	And now final fantasy 13 might, if these theories prove to end up being three games that are
2808560	2811600	all just one, two, three, final fantasy 13, one, two, three.
2811600	2815360	It's kind of weird how it transformed like that.
2815360	2818240	Alan?
2818240	2822200	And I think the reason why a lot of people are invested in this story is for those who
2822200	2825200	don't follow Square Enix that closely.
2825200	2830400	The crew that like the director and the main crew who did the Kingdom Hearts console games
2830400	2835420	have been working on 13 versus 13 for however five, six years.
2835420	2841600	So for it to become vaporware maybe would piss a lot of people off because depending
2841600	2845880	on how tinfoil hat you want to get, the Kingdom Hearts console team has been working on it.
2845880	2848960	So they need to have a product out so they can work on the next Kingdom Hearts.
2848960	2852400	I just can't see Square just throwing it away.
2852400	2857900	I could see where Square has decided Kingdom Hearts three needs to happen now.
2857900	2861520	And so maybe they have maybe they've said, you know what, guys, you've had this game
2861520	2863400	for two F and long.
2863400	2866360	So we're taking it away from you and giving it to this other team.
2866360	2869880	And we're going to put it out under a new name and you guys go work on Kingdom Hearts
2869880	2870880	three.
2870880	2875280	I mean, anything is possible in that regard, but just for them to throw away six years
2875280	2876520	worth of work.
2876520	2880580	If you think about everybody's salary that gets paid for that, that's millions of dollars
2880580	2881580	they're throwing away.
2881580	2882580	If they do that.
2882580	2883580	And I highly doubt they're going to be thrown away.
2883580	2886840	A lot of final fantasy games before remember all that stuff that grin was working on, they
2886840	2890640	were working on a final fantasy game and that, but that was grin.
2890640	2895040	That wasn't, you know, I understand that, but they, they're not beyond throwing.
2895040	2899060	Although some things that they should really throw out 14, um, they just don't and they
2899060	2900060	hold on.
2900060	2901060	That's the other thing.
2901060	2905520	Maybe final, maybe they're realizing they need to rush 15 because 14, they need to erase
2905520	2909120	14 basically, which is still getting relaunched.
2909120	2915120	Well, I've also saw speculation that the reason why there's no press release saying yes versus
2915120	2918960	13, this is what's happened to it, whether it be canceled or whatever is because their
2918960	2923240	last year fiscally was so bad because of 14 shedding the bed that they're just not putting
2923240	2927420	out negative press releases anymore because of damage control from 14.
2927420	2932920	But that's kind of, I don't, that's a thought, um, I don't want to drag this out too long,
2932920	2933920	much longer.
2933920	2936680	I want to get to the next story, but I do want to kind of throw this idea out there
2936680	2940620	because somebody on Facebook had said this and I was like, Hmm, that's a good point.
2940620	2947480	Is that, well, if they canceled final fantasy 13 verses, why did they just release the theme
2947480	2949800	song for theater rhythm?
2949800	2953120	Because theater rhythm has that song as a downloadable song.
2953120	2958240	So why would they release that if they just canceled the game and tease this final fantasy
2958240	2959960	13 verses?
2959960	2963180	Of course, this could be the case of Square Enix being a giant company.
2963180	2968480	The left hand hasn't told the right hand theater rhythm DLC team what's going on, but I thought
2968480	2970720	it was an interesting point.
2970720	2976400	So, all right, let's move on to another story.
2976400	2980900	This is about the Xbox 360 and something that's developing on the 360, but we didn't hear
2980900	2984680	anything about it at E3, but this totally seems like the type of thing they would have
2984680	2987680	announced, but I guess they didn't.
2987680	2991280	It's something called Avatar fame stars.
2991280	2995640	Now a trademark for the game had turned up earlier in the year, but now we're starting
2995640	3001960	to see this actually appear in games, such as Wreck-A-Tear, not to be confused with the
3001960	3003760	game that's on Steam.
3003760	3007400	This is Wreck, like Wreck-It Ralph, Wreck-A-Tear.
3007400	3014240	It is part of Microsoft Summer of Arcade series, and it is including this Avatar fame stars.
3014240	3015240	What is this?
3015240	3020060	Quote, Avatar fame stars is a new program for Microsoft Studios and is part of a select
3020060	3024840	group of games that delivers new and exciting ways to play online with your friends and
3024840	3029400	compete for social recognition, according to Microsoft.
3029400	3036640	I guess this is supposed to include in-game challenges, and this sounds kind of like rebranding
3036640	3043040	of shit that's already been there, because if you do these challenges, or I thought achievements,
3043040	3048760	in these Avatar fame star games, you get rewards based on your fame star points.
3048760	3051080	Oh, so like rewards for my avatar.
3051080	3053800	Doesn't that technology already exist on the 360?
3053800	3058920	Like I could swear that if you play, like, Super Meat Boy, you get a t-shirt, or Minecraft,
3058920	3061120	and there's tons of that type of stuff in games.
3061120	3063680	So I'm trying to figure out, like, what is this?
3063680	3067680	But I guess what they're doing is instead of it being game by game by game, this is
3067680	3070020	one gigantic pool.
3070020	3074760	So like, you know, if a game is participating in this pool, then you, you know, get the
3074760	3079240	points and the achievement points towards a common unlock.
3079240	3082920	That's like the difference, which is a little weird, but that's how it works.
3082920	3088520	So the rewards cross from game to game, as does the points total.
3088520	3092360	Avatar fame stars is locked to your Xbox 360.
3092360	3097240	They're saying it's possible this is something that could spill over to Windows 8, Surface
3097240	3100040	tablets, Windows phones, who knows.
3100040	3105980	Other games that will include Avatar fame star support, Full House Poker, World of Kieflings,
3105980	3110760	so games that already exist, it's gonna be kind of patched in, Fire Pro Wrestling, Home
3110760	3114360	Run stars, Avatar, Motocross, Madness.
3114360	3117700	We don't know when the already existing games will have it patched in or when all these
3117700	3123320	other games are coming out, but I guess if you're into collecting Avatar awards, there
3123320	3126520	you go.
3126520	3130280	I don't know about you guys, but pretty much every Avatar on my friends list is all wearing
3130280	3132500	Mass Effect garb.
3132500	3133500	Not me, though.
3133500	3135600	I actually tried to make my Avatar look like me.
3135600	3143360	I was a sucker and I spent like 120 Microsoft points to get a stupid hat for my Avatar that
3143360	3149480	looks like a hat I would wear out to a club, because I am a sucker.
3149480	3154240	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
3154240	3158760	So Valve is always trying to do great and interesting things with Steam.
3158760	3162680	It's a gaming store and application.
3162680	3167960	They brought Steam to Mac and Apple platforms, and they also invented Steam Play, which is
3167960	3172040	where if you buy a license for one game on PC, you get it for Mac and vice versa, and
3172040	3175160	now they're bringing Steam to Linux.
3175160	3177420	So there's gonna be a Steam client for Linux.
3177420	3185780	They are using the Ubuntu distribution, and for people who aren't familiar with Linux,
3185780	3191880	there's different revisions of it based on which company wrote that build of it, and
3191880	3196080	there's Red Hat and Corel and Ubuntu.
3196080	3201000	So yeah, that's what they're going for, because it's sort of the popular make of it right
3201000	3202000	now.
3202000	3207120	And the first game that they're porting to, their first party title that they're bringing
3207120	3212240	to Steam Linux is Left 4 Dead 2.
3212240	3218800	And they've been working on it since last year, 2011, and I guess there will be an internal
3218800	3221620	beta of Steam on Ubuntu in the near future.
3221620	3227240	So they've announced that it is coming soon, and Left 4 Dead 2 is the first title they're
3227240	3228680	bringing to it.
3228680	3233960	If other developers want to port their games over to Linux, this Valve is making the distribution
3233960	3234960	model for it.
3234960	3237920	You ran a Linux box for a while, didn't you?
3237920	3238920	Kind of, yeah.
3238920	3239920	I had a FreeBSD box.
3239920	3244040	That was a long time ago, back when I was trying to host my own domain name and be a
3244040	3245640	super nerd.
3245640	3246640	Let me ask this question.
3246640	3248400	I'm gonna take it back a huge step here.
3248400	3251240	I'm gonna want to ask this question, because I seriously think a lot of people don't know
3251240	3252240	the answer to this.
3252240	3258040	And I think sometimes the hardcore computer people, super nerds, don't realize that a
3258040	3261320	lot of people don't get this, or maybe they do, I don't know.
3261320	3265520	But why would someone want to have a Linux machine?
3265520	3268000	What does Linux do for you that Windows doesn't?
3268000	3269000	Uptime.
3269000	3273000	A well-made Linux install.
3273000	3275780	You just have your computer on all the time.
3275780	3279500	You don't lose any performance.
3279500	3282900	You can put...
3282900	3286080	The terminology, I haven't touched this stuff in, seriously, like ten years.
3286080	3287200	But it's not...
3287200	3292360	When people think Linux or Unix, they think of sort of like MS-DOS prompt, like just a
3292360	3293560	text terminal.
3293560	3295600	But that's not the case.
3295600	3303640	Linux has visual Windows-ish interfaces now.
3303640	3308220	If you're into independent software, like really independent, Linux has got a huge community.
3308220	3312840	People making apps for each other, I don't know, it's just all about the...
3312840	3316200	If you do have a good internet connection, you wanna host your own email, host your own
3316200	3321960	domain names, host your own web server, blah, blah, blah, you're gonna be running some flavor
3321960	3325520	of Linux on that box, if you wanna do all that in-house.
3325520	3329160	Look at all these nerds in our chat room, and I say that lovingly.
3329160	3333360	Black Wolf says, I've had a free BSD server up for over 1,000 days.
3333360	3334360	Uptime.
3334360	3335360	Uptime.
3335360	3340120	My home box was up for 400 days until I rebooted it recently.
3340120	3344760	Tiger Claw says Linux is commonly used to run servers, especially for online games.
3344760	3348400	Game Guru says Linux is generally more secure than Windows.
3348400	3350500	Is that though because just less people use it?
3350500	3356000	It's kinda like the whole, well, Apple never gets hacked, because there's less people on
3356000	3357920	those systems than there are on...
3357920	3362680	Well, there was a problem in the early 2000s where certain distributions of Linux, if you
3362680	3367020	just put it on a machine, would have its email relay turned on by default.
3367020	3370160	So if someone found your IP address, they could just spam the shit out of everybody
3370160	3372900	using your server, and you would never know.
3372900	3379480	So if you don't know what you're doing, people can do nasty things on your Linux box.
3379480	3385680	But then that's your problem, it's you being an idiot, not the software being built flawed.
3385680	3390920	Well Technus says, I like Linux, I hate the elitist community that comes with it.
3390920	3399000	Yeah, FreeBSD versus Linux, or just the StarBSD versus StarLinux, that's some Star Wars Star
3399000	3400000	Trek shit.
3400000	3407200	Like, there's Switchblades, and people get shivved in alleyways, it's very brutal.
3407200	3410480	So Steam on Linux, do you think that would be well received by the community?
3410480	3413000	Or do you think it'll be like, ugh, commercialism?
3413000	3419680	Well, they would have to run, if they really wanted to play Windows games on Linux, they
3419680	3424640	would have to do, I think, it's called Wine, which is kind of like, I think, Bootcamp.
3424640	3428440	A lot of people on the internet wine very well.
3428440	3432720	It's like Bootcamp or Parallels, I think, on Mac, where you can run Windows through
3432720	3433720	it.
3433720	3439120	So if people wanted to play PC games, but they just, I don't want a PC box in my house,
3439120	3444440	I don't want a partition of a hard drive, god damn it, this will allow them to do that,
3444440	3446960	for at least for Left 4 Dead 2.
3446960	3449520	Anything else, if they don't want to have a Windows box or a Windows partition, they're
3449520	3452640	going to have to mess with it.
3452640	3457800	Alright, BlackWolf says very clearly, Wine is not an emulator, it basically implements
3457800	3459440	the Windows DLLs on Linux.
3459440	3460440	Okay.
3460440	3461440	Alright.
3461440	3462440	It's a little correction.
3462440	3463440	Yep.
3463440	3465520	Because remember, Linux, elitist, right Bobby?
3465520	3468080	I'm just, I'm giving him a hard time.
3468080	3472320	Alright, GameGrew says Left 4 Dead 2 is a good choice, it's a rather complex source
3472320	3473320	game.
3473320	3475760	That's true, if you can get that on there, then that opens the door to a lot of other
3475760	3476760	games.
3476760	3482480	I want to go on to the next story, Loki, I want to, Wine actually stands for Wine is
3482480	3483480	not an emulator.
3483480	3486040	Yeah, I think I actually knew that, but I'm so far removed.
3486040	3487720	10 years, just saying old age.
3487720	3488720	Yeah.
3488720	3489720	Alright.
3489720	3492240	I want to go back to a comment that came up in chat earlier, because this is a very important
3492240	3495200	clarification to something I had brought up a minute ago.
3495200	3501680	Ospher in our chatroom says, for the Theatrhythm DLC for Somnus from Final Fantasy Versus 13,
3501680	3508160	it labels the song as just from the Final Fantasy series, but not which one.
3508160	3511680	Maybe that's a sign of the name change that they don't want to reveal yet.
3511680	3516640	That is huge, that is a big deal, I think that's worth stating, so thank you for saying
3516640	3517640	that, Ospher.
3517640	3522400	I think that is, if they didn't label it as Versus 13, then yes, a name change is coming,
3522400	3524400	or question mark, question mark.
3524400	3526400	I think you're right.
3526400	3527400	Very interesting.
3527400	3529120	Alright, back to news, sorry, Loki.
3529120	3536840	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Fez, and Fez had an issue with one of its
3536840	3543760	recent patches, where not a lot of people, but some people were having issues with their
3543760	3551960	save games being obliterated, and of course, because of that, Polytron pulled back the
3551960	3560120	patch that they put out, and they were gonna release a second patch to fix that problem,
3560120	3567280	however they said no, because it was gonna cost them $10,000 to get the game recertified
3567280	3573840	by Microsoft, and so they're just saying, well, you know, if any players have an issue
3573840	3581800	with the game, your save's being deleted since you're only like 1%, kinda tough luck, you're
3581800	3585480	just gonna have to deal with it.
3585480	3590520	So of course, they made the comment, you know, had Fez been released on Steam, we wouldn't
3590520	3594160	have this issue, because updates are free.
3594160	3601080	But I believe the designer of Fez said it's not a PC game, didn't want it on PCs, so...
3601080	3602240	Exactly.
3602240	3606440	And then they said no, well, does that mean a Steam version is in progress?
3606440	3612480	Only a few months left for Xbox Live Arcade exclusivity, they said.
3612480	3618400	Microsoft of course responded, saying, you know, that Polytron and their investors, Trapdoor,
3618400	3622520	made the decision not to work on an additional title update for Fez.
3622520	3626800	Microsoft Studios chose to support this decision based on the belief that Polytron slash Trapdoor
3626800	3631840	were in the best position to determine what the acceptable quality level for their game
3631840	3633040	is.
3633040	3638000	And while we do not disclose the cost of title updates, we do offer, we did offer to work
3638000	3642240	with Trapdoor and make sure that wasn't a blocking issue.
3642240	3645860	We remain a huge fan of Fez.
3645860	3650280	So I don't know if that means, okay, we're not gonna charge you 10,000, but we'll charge
3650280	3651280	you 7,500.
3651280	3652280	Discount!
3652280	3653280	Discount.
3653280	3656000	I mean, I don't really know what these issues...
3656000	3660360	Apparently Microsoft patches are available in the Steam sale.
3660360	3661360	But here's my thing.
3661360	3667440	I mean, it's problems, first off, you know, it is closed system, so Microsoft can charge
3667440	3668440	you whatever the hell you want.
3668440	3672280	But when you make your game, you're well aware of what those costs are gonna be before you
3672280	3673600	make your game.
3673600	3676680	And they probably thought, okay, well that's no problem, we're not gonna have an issue
3676680	3677680	with this stuff.
3677680	3680980	But then some bugs went through, and so they released a patch, which obviously they did
3680980	3682480	not test well enough.
3682480	3686140	And if it's only having the 1% of the people at the time, see, I don't understand how a
3686140	3691180	save game problem can only be having the 1% of the people, because that's, you're basically
3691180	3694500	running on systems that are all the same.
3694500	3697360	You know, I don't understand how it can affect one and not the other.
3697360	3698760	But whatever.
3698760	3702860	So they released a patch that they didn't test well enough, and now they're complaining
3702860	3708320	that they would have to pay more money out of their pocket to, you know, fix the game.
3708320	3711440	And I understand that this developer is not as big as, like, Activision, who releases
3711440	3714560	like 13 goddamn patches for Call of Duty, and...
3714560	3720280	But they were in Indie Movie the Game, surely they must be, er, Indie Game the Movie.
3720280	3721280	Wow.
3721280	3725920	They were in Indie Game the Movie, surely they must be rich.
3725920	3731560	Well, I don't know if that's the case, but, you know, maybe $10,000 is too much.
3731560	3735240	Maybe they're kind of like opportunity cost, we can either fix it for the 1%, but are we
3735240	3739320	really gonna recruit this money in additional sales, or do we just leave it as it is, and
3739320	3743520	hopefully it doesn't affect that many more people, and we'll just, you know, keep the
3743520	3744520	money where we're at.
3744520	3747260	I think that's kind of where they're at, is that they didn't want to spend the money.
3747260	3750000	It's a tricky issue though, because like on one hand I'm like, wow, that's kind of fucked
3750000	3753360	up of Microsoft to charge so much money, but on the other hand I'm like, well it also really
3753360	3756920	encourages people to get it right the first time, so you can't blame them.
3756920	3763340	As it is, games are patched left and right anyways, and, um, you know, I think that it's
3763340	3766260	a good thing that they do charge that kind of money, because it does discourage them
3766260	3769760	from like going, well fuck it, we didn't really test this game, so we're just gonna release
3769760	3772720	it out there, we'll see what kind of bugs people run into, and then we'll go fix it.
3772720	3776120	I should be able to get a refund when their game is buggy as hell.
3776120	3781600	Although, granted, it's only affecting less than one, or whatever it is, 1% of people,
3781600	3787600	but if I'm in that 1%, I should be able to get my money back, don't you think?
3787600	3790160	You'd have to make the argument with Microsoft.
3790160	3793520	Welcome to the world of digital distribution.
3793520	3795400	Yeah.
3795400	3798760	They just take customer service right on out of the picture.
3798760	3805520	But to be fair, it's not necessarily Microsoft's fault that that game doesn't work.
3805520	3809400	It's just being hosted on their servers, it's the developer and publisher that decided,
3809400	3813280	hey, we don't want to pay money to fix this game, so you're gonna have to go ask them
3813280	3814280	for your money back.
3814280	3818720	Yeah, but it's on their system, it's only on their system, they kind of own it a little
3818720	3819720	bit too.
3819720	3820720	You know?
3820720	3821720	I mean, whether they want to or not.
3821720	3822720	But it's not their fault, though.
3822720	3823720	I know.
3823720	3831640	That's like saying, you know, oh, that game is, you know, this game is buggy, and just
3831640	3835640	because it happens to be on Xbox 360, I'm gonna blame Microsoft for it.
3835640	3838960	It doesn't make any sense, because they're just providing the system that it runs on.
3838960	3840880	Their system's not causing the problem.
3840880	3843520	At least I don't think it is.
3843520	3849560	All right, well, let's move on to a different topic that apparently is causing a big problem
3849560	3852760	in the iPad world, or iOS.
3852760	3855400	But this particularly is for the iPad.
3855400	3861060	And Alan, I'm pretty happy that Maruko in Sanrio, your cats, aren't into playing games
3861060	3862060	on my iPad.
3862060	3863060	Because apparently...
3863060	3864060	They're too old.
3864060	3865060	They don't care.
3865060	3866060	They don't care anymore.
3866060	3870400	Well, apparently, there is an iPad app out there called Games for Cats.
3870400	3875040	It's an iPad game that is actually aimed at cats, you know, for them to, like, paw at
3875040	3876040	the iPad.
3876040	3879920	I would be worried about them scratching it up, but I guess it doesn't...
3879920	3884400	Yeah, I'm incredibly against decline cats, because they actually remove, like, it's part
3884400	3885400	of the bone.
3885400	3886400	Yeah.
3886400	3887400	So you're taking off, like, half their finger.
3887400	3888800	So I think that's wrong.
3888800	3893120	But if you don't have a declawed cat, why is it pawing at your iPad?
3893120	3894760	It costs, like, $800.
3894760	3895760	What is wrong with you?
3895760	3898720	I don't think the glass scratches that easy from cats scratching it.
3898720	3901960	I mean, like, my cat scratches our LCD TV, and...
3901960	3905880	I wouldn't want to take that chance, because I look at the sofa, and I'm like...
3905880	3906960	Well, that's the sofa.
3906960	3910440	That's where, you know, you've got material where the cat's claws are getting caught in.
3910440	3911440	Cats have already...
3911440	3912840	The cats have already fucked up the bed.
3912840	3913840	I don't even...
3913840	3914840	Yeah, but we're talking glass.
3914840	3919280	We're talking glass that's meant to, you know, withstand, you know, quite a few scuffs.
3919280	3923640	You know, obviously dropping it on something, or scraping it on something sharp, you know,
3923640	3924640	might cause a scratch.
3924640	3925640	But it's...
3925640	3928720	The cat claws aren't strong enough to cause a lot of scratches.
3928720	3930880	And there's folks in the chat saying they...
3930880	3933760	Bobby Blackwolf says their claws don't scratch the screen.
3933760	3934760	They've tested.
3934760	3935760	Plus...
3935760	3936760	I hear that.
3936760	3937760	I just don't believe it.
3937760	3938760	Plus the bottom of their feet.
3938760	3939800	The bottom of their feet are nice and soft.
3939800	3943040	So whatever scratches they put in there, they buff right out.
3943040	3944040	So it's fun.
3944040	3948400	Yeah, when a cat bats at something playfully, it doesn't have its claws out, but when it's
3948400	3953720	trying to scratch, like when it's trying to fuck up a chair, it's trying to clean its
3953720	3954720	claws on it.
3954720	3955720	So yes, its claws are out.
3955720	3957760	But it's not going to do that on an iPad.
3957760	3962720	Unless they really hate Macs, or, you know, Apple.
3962720	3966040	Well anyway, which maybe Sanrio hates Apple.
3966040	3967560	I don't want her scratching the iPad.
3967560	3971320	But anyway, all seriousness, back to the article.
3971320	3972320	Games for Cats.
3972320	3973480	It is an iPad game.
3973480	3975800	It's, you know, of course, for cats.
3975800	3980960	It, like everything else in the Apple world these days, has DLC.
3980960	3981960	Double dippin'.
3981960	3982960	Right?
3982960	3985960	Charge you up front and then, hey, you want more levels for your cats?
3985960	3988940	Ninety-nine cents for a new mouse level.
3988940	3989940	What a surprise.
3989940	3993840	But here's the real surprise.
3993840	3995640	Cats bought it.
3995640	4002900	Apparently, there's this epidemic where cats are inadvertently buying the DLC.
4002900	4009640	And people are complaining that the design of the game fooled cats into buying it on
4009640	4010640	purpose.
4010640	4015040	Yeah, because there's probably some little mouse that says, buy more on it, that runs
4015040	4016040	across the screen.
4016040	4019480	And then the next one is, yes to check out.
4019480	4020760	And that's it.
4020760	4024800	You know, real hard stuff to code around.
4024800	4030080	I thought that they had to put in passwords in order to get that stuff purchased.
4030080	4032240	You can save those, apparently.
4032240	4033960	Because I can't do that on my iPod.
4033960	4034960	I have to, you know.
4034960	4037560	No, you can save your password, so it never prompts you for that stuff.
4037560	4039480	Well, then it's the fault of the owner.
4039480	4040480	Well.
4040480	4042160	And because you're buying games for your cat.
4042160	4046120	Have you thought that maybe, you know, that's like a stupid thing?
4046120	4050920	I'm gonna whip out my multi-hundred dollar device here so my cat can...
4050920	4052520	Why is it stupid?
4052520	4054960	We let our cats watch the TV.
4054960	4057240	We, you know, why is it stupid?
4057240	4061280	That's like, okay, this is basically like saying, hey, you know what, my cat likes the
4061280	4064800	outdoors, I'm gonna buy it a car so it can drive down the street because it fucking likes
4064800	4065800	the outdoors.
4065800	4066800	Tootsies is real.
4066800	4072720	I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that I can see someone having a little
4072720	4077280	swipe, you know, a little game visually for the cat on an iPad.
4077280	4078280	That's fine.
4078280	4079280	I can believe that.
4079280	4084800	What I can't believe is someone going, hmm, Mittens was really into that game a week ago,
4084800	4086040	but now she just doesn't care.
4086040	4087600	I think she needs the DLC.
4087600	4092200	I think she needs a new, a new, a new, a new stage for her to be interested in again.
4092200	4093200	Yeah.
4093200	4096080	No cats don't give a shit, right?
4096080	4101120	I'm going to, yeah, for 99 cents you can get a shoestring and that will entertain your
4101120	4102120	cat forever.
4102120	4106320	The cat's not going to go, I already know how to chase the mouse on this maze.
4106320	4107320	I need a new maze.
4107320	4109640	She's just, I don't, she's not going to play anymore.
4109640	4113940	These are cats that still chase laser pointers, even though like, you know, years and years
4113940	4117220	and years of chasing it, they know they can't catch the fucking light, but they will still
4117220	4121000	chase it because they're fucking stupid and they're like, I got to get that light.
4121000	4122000	I got to get the light.
4122000	4123000	The light's delicious.
4123000	4126760	Eat the light, light, light, chase the light, light.
4126760	4127760	I'm going to get it.
4127760	4128760	The light light.
4128760	4129760	I got it.
4129760	4130760	I got it.
4130760	4131760	Oh damn it.
4131760	4132760	It's on my paw.
4132760	4133760	Got it.
4133760	4134760	Oh, so close.
4134760	4135760	Got it.
4135760	4136760	Light light.
4136760	4137760	Where'd it go?
4137760	4138760	Where'd it go?
4138760	4139760	Where'd it go?
4139760	4140760	Where'd it go?
4140760	4141760	Where'd it go?
4141760	4142760	That can also be a dog too, by the way.
4142760	4143760	Dogs do that.
4143760	4145060	I used to love that cause like I'd played with the laser pointer with my dog and you'd see
4145060	4147320	her just like twitching out for like an hour afterwards.
4147320	4152160	Just like, what, what, what, what, what they're coming for me.
4152160	4153160	Wait, wait.
4153160	4154160	I put it right there.
4154160	4155160	Where is it?
4155160	4156160	All right.
4156160	4161460	Uh, to answer the folks in chat hiccup is the company behind this game and an artist
4161460	4173200	named TJ fuller, who did the artwork in games for cats said, quote, we got in a lot of trouble.
4173200	4178660	So they have implemented a human check to fix the issue.
4178660	4185260	You have to hold four fingers on touch points without moving them for a few seconds because
4185260	4190560	the cat would never have that type of attention span to hold in four spots for a few seconds.
4190560	4198080	Unless it's standing on top of the iPad.
4198080	4202600	So just like you have to monitor your children when they're playing with the iPad, maybe
4202600	4205900	you should monitor your cat because let's be real.
4205900	4209120	You're not buying the app on the iPad for the cat's enjoyment.
4209120	4212400	You're buying it for yours to watch the cat play it.
4212400	4219680	Are you really get the cat away from you so they would stop bothering.
4219680	4223440	Rama and chat says, this all reminds me of the Smurfs village fiasco.
4223440	4224480	Yes, Rama.
4224480	4225480	But those were children.
4225480	4226480	This is a cat.
4226480	4227480	It doesn't matter.
4227480	4228760	They still have like 13 year olds.
4228760	4232720	I didn't know that those Microsoft purchases were real money.
4232720	4233720	Right.
4233720	4235720	You didn't know that.
4235720	4236720	Sure.
4236720	4243360	Well, my, my fireworks are going, well, now you know who, what's the name of the really
4243360	4248840	he's really old, uh, he's got the sunglasses, the fashion designer, Margaret show had a
4248840	4249840	bit about him.
4249840	4251440	Um, Carl Lagerfeld.
4251440	4252520	Yes.
4252520	4256880	His cat has a personal assistant and a Twitter and its own iPad.
4256880	4258320	So let's put that out there.
4258320	4261080	Carl Lagerfeld's cat has its own iPad.
4261080	4269720	So that maybe that could be, you know, what have you done with your life?
4269720	4271720	So that story, this story reminded me of that.
4271720	4272720	Yeah.
4272720	4273720	That's a real thing.
4273720	4274920	What would you put on your resume?
4274920	4278540	I, yeah, I w I was a personal assistant to this cat.
4278540	4281040	That was my last, the cat fired me because I
4281040	4295040	Toon says, the cat who could drive a car, he drives around all over the town, toon says,
4295040	4297040	the cat who could drive a car.
4297040	4300040	Don't just look at it.
4300040	4302040	Let's be real.
4302040	4310040	Toon says did a good thing by making sure Victoria Jackson was in that car.
4310040	4312580	Agree.
4312580	4313980	And poor Phil Hartman.
4313980	4314980	Poor Phil Hartman.
4314980	4317680	Rest in peace.
4317680	4323220	To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on vognetwork.com.
4323220	4325040	Use the passphrase kitten.
4325040	4326860	All right.
4326860	4327860	Let's move on.
4327860	4328860	Allen.
4328860	4329860	Excuse me.
4329860	4332500	I'm eating popcorn.
4332500	4335900	So uh, what's going on?
4335900	4343880	Sony is shutting down the online servers for two of its motor storm muddy truck games.
4343880	4348320	Specifically its motor storm pacific rift, which came out in 2008.
4348320	4350640	So that is four years old.
4350640	4354000	And its PSP counterpart, motor storm arctic edge.
4354000	4359720	So if you like to connect to PSN and do races, co-op or whatever with the matching service,
4359720	4361240	that is all going away.
4361240	4365880	As of, I think, October 1st.
4365880	4369680	It's the last day, or I guess September 30th is the last day you have to enjoy that.
4369680	4370680	October 1st.
4370680	4372280	I'll give you a heads up.
4372280	4373280	That was nice.
4373280	4377160	Is there any of these games, online pass games or we know that's, we're not here.
4377160	4380400	I didn't even get into it when I was bitching about mass effect three, by the way, I didn't
4380400	4385120	even get into the online pass thing and how my $10 isn't paying for shit, but anyway,
4385120	4388800	I'll just let that argument right itself, boys and girls, I just want to throw that
4388800	4393520	out there, but I guess, yeah, it's a really short story.
4393520	4395180	That's that's really it.
4395180	4401160	Motorstorm Pacific Rift and Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is a PSP title, losing its Sony
4401160	4405640	provided network while the machines are molding over anyway, so that one's not so bad, you
4405640	4406640	know.
4406640	4411280	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what
4411280	4413880	games we can buy that will have their servers shut down in 2015.
4413880	4418040	Well, I don't know if any of these games are going to have their servers shut down, but
4418040	4422320	there is not really much coming out this week because it's kind of falling along the lines
4422320	4427360	of July, the month with no game releases.
4427360	4433620	But this week we do have, if you're feeling, you know, that you got to get in shape to
4433620	4438160	wear a bikini, you know, maybe not this year because you've procrastinated too long.
4438160	4446120	But for next year, they've got the Adidas My Coach for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 move
4446120	4447120	in.
4447120	4448120	There's tons of preorders for that.
4448120	4449520	Move and connect.
4449520	4450880	That's coming out this week.
4450880	4458080	Just on 3DS, you know, because there's actually people that were born well after that game
4458080	4459580	came out.
4459580	4463880	And Prototype 2 on PC finally making its way out.
4463880	4468400	That was quite delayed.
4468400	4473760	And then also I guess they have a move essential bundle for the PlayStation 3 with Just Dance
4473760	4477240	3 thrown in there.
4477240	4479120	All right.
4479120	4480860	So that's it.
4480860	4483240	Going to Japan this week in Japan.
4483240	4488560	A couple more releases in Japan, but not a lot, but I know this one is extremely popular.
4488560	4490200	Came up on the show a couple weeks ago.
4490200	4495680	Persona 4, the ultimate in Mayanaka Arena, although remember that's the one that's region
4495680	4497520	locked on PlayStation 3.
4497520	4500800	It's also available on Xbox 360, which was always region locked.
4500800	4503840	But that is out in Japan this week on July the 26th.
4503840	4508840	Alice Madness Returns gets a price reduction on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
4508840	4514360	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Multi-Raid 2 HD version.
4514360	4517160	That tells me this is a remake HD version.
4517160	4520600	This is a remake of a title that was already out there.
4520600	4523960	Trying to see if this is a game I recognize from here.
4523960	4528860	It looks like, looks kind of like a Dynasty Warriors-esque game, but I don't think that's
4528860	4529860	what it is.
4529860	4532340	But like, you know, combo points and all that stuff.
4532340	4535580	But it's HD version.
4535580	4541120	Also coming out this week, the Super Dimension Fortress Macross Hybrid Pack, which I believe
4541120	4545780	would mean it's the game and the Blu-ray making its way out in Japan this week.
4545780	4548120	That's the 360 on the PlayStation 3.
4548120	4550840	Let's take a look at the Vita real quick.
4550840	4553200	Nothing really of note on the Vita this week.
4553200	4556760	Some accessories, a new AC adapter, but that's not that exciting.
4556760	4563180	So lastly on the 3DS this week, Cave Story 3D makes its way to Japan this week, as does
4563180	4565720	a new pen in cobalt blue.
4565720	4566720	Ooh-ah.
4566720	4568720	That does it for Japanese releases.
4568720	4569720	Alan, UK.
4569720	4575680	UK and Europe, Prototype 2 on PC is coming out July 24th.
4575680	4583000	July 25th, we have Wizorb, which I would recommend very much if you're into 16-bit retro sort
4583000	4584000	of games.
4584000	4587960	It's 2D, but it's an RPG Arkanoid Breakout mashup game.
4587960	4591940	So it's got the Super NES graphics, and you're a little wizard playing Breakout, and it's
4591940	4592940	really fun.
4592940	4593940	You can have that on Steam.
4593940	4594940	It's cute.
4594940	4595940	Yeah.
4595940	4598200	It's also, check out the Steam sale before it goes away, because I got it a couple days
4598200	4599520	ago for like three bucks.
4599520	4603120	And on the indie games for Xbox if you don't have that.
4603120	4604120	Oh, nice.
4604120	4605120	Yeah.
4605120	4609960	So that's specifically on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PSP.
4609960	4615760	Wizorb also on July 25th, Recettear, which is the game we were talking about earlier.
4615760	4621720	July 27th, we have Inversion on PC, and Pokemon Conquest on DS, and then finally for this
4621720	4629680	week on July 28th, Freaky Forms Deluxe Your Creations Alive, which is a very silly name.
4629680	4630880	I don't know what that is.
4630880	4635760	All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get into the classic game of
4635760	4636760	the week.
4636760	4641040	Dark Soccer may not be here to give a classic game out, but Salacious Pop will fill in,
4641040	4643300	and we'll figure out what he picked in just a minute.
4643300	4644800	For now, Loki.
4644800	4646920	So this is kind of interesting.
4646920	4651280	You may remember a few years ago, there was a class, I mean, there's always class action
4651280	4655480	lawsuits when it comes to Madden and NCAA, but there's one that actually went to court,
4655480	4656760	and they finally settled.
4656760	4665520	So EA has reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that started in 2008 for $27
4665520	4666840	million.
4666840	4674280	Also part of that, they will not be able to renew their exclusive agreement with the NCAA,
4674280	4677600	assuming that the court upholds that.
4677600	4684800	And then of course, you know, because of that, those who were affected by it, who purchased
4684800	4698200	a EA Sports NCAA game, will be entitled to anywhere from $6.79 per game on the GameCube,
4698200	4703960	Xbox and Playstation 2, and $1.95 for the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3.
4703960	4708560	And they're saying that also, EA has agreed to the stipulation on future license agreements
4708560	4710680	as part of the proposed settlement.
4710680	4714840	They will not make any exclusive licensing deals with the AFL for five years, and they
4714840	4720040	will not renew their current agreement with the NCAA, and also they won't be able to enter
4720040	4726120	another exclusive licensing agreement with the NCAA for five years.
4726120	4731080	And the exclusive, I guess, well the trademarks for like the NFL and stuff are not affected
4731080	4735000	by it because this is only the NCAA, but it's still interesting.
4735000	4739400	Yeah, I was going to say, I don't follow sports titles as closely, you know, I think that's
4739400	4742360	pretty obvious if you've listened to the show for a while, but obviously these are huge
4742360	4743360	money games.
4743360	4747240	I know EA's had a lot of, they've taken a lot of shit for their exclusive agreements
4747240	4748280	in the past.
4748280	4751000	This kind of seems like a big deal here.
4751000	4757120	I mean, granted, the refunds that people get aren't that big a deal, although I heard that
4757120	4762560	whatever people don't claim will go to child's play, which, that's great, but I'm talking
4762560	4767320	more about the future, about how future licensing agreements work, that seems like it might
4767320	4768320	be a big deal.
4768320	4771480	Well, all it's going to mean is that they're not going to be exclusive, so they're still,
4771480	4775600	I mean, this doesn't mean the NCAA football is going away anytime soon, it just means
4775600	4778720	that there could be a version from 2K.
4778720	4781160	That's huge, in my opinion, if 2K could do those.
4781160	4786040	Well, I mean, remember they did all, was it, all pro football or something like that, it's
4786040	4787160	sucked.
4787160	4793800	Well, it sucked because it didn't have those licenses, so it didn't have as big of a budget.
4793800	4795520	But it sucked as just a game, though.
4795520	4800120	I mean, not to say they couldn't pull something out, but I don't know.
4800120	4806160	Then the other thing, too, is that this has to, they have to wait on approval from the
4806160	4810440	court, which is going to happen on September 27th, so this is all, right now, the settlement,
4810440	4815320	but the court has to say, okay, we agreed it, you know, the settlement's fine.
4815320	4817240	So we'll just have to see what happens there.
4817240	4821000	And we should say, again, the NFL trademark is not, it does not affect it.
4821000	4825720	No, this does not affect Madden at all, so, um, but I just think it's funny, though, is
4825720	4828920	that arena football is also, I mean, they haven't had an arena football game in forever.
4828920	4832200	Although, I didn't remember, they did try that for a while, they had an arena football
4832200	4833580	game for like two years.
4833580	4835920	What about the XFL game?
4835920	4836920	I'm just kidding.
4836920	4837920	Hold on.
4837920	4838920	Remember the XFL?
4838920	4839920	Hold on.
4839920	4840920	That was hilarious.
4840920	4847120	You laugh, you laugh right now, but you know what league is considering a game, actually?
4847120	4850640	Not necessarily EA publishing it, but there is a game coming for this league.
4850640	4851640	Uh oh.
4851640	4854000	The Lingerie Football League.
4854000	4855000	Fuck yeah.
4855000	4858560	I'm telling you, that's a real thing.
4858560	4863400	I might play that.
4863400	4864400	That sounds awesome.
4864400	4869080	You know the problem with those Lingerie Football Leagues and stuff like that?
4869080	4873600	It's, I mean, the people watch it because they're hoping that, like, a top gets ripped
4873600	4874600	off.
4874600	4875600	It never fucking happens.
4875600	4880720	So, cause, so that's my problem, it's not adult enough, you know?
4880720	4883160	We need an adult game.
4883160	4884400	I need an adult.
4884400	4888280	There's only so much plausible deniability on why you're watching it before it's like,
4888280	4892080	I could have looked at so much porn in the time that I've been watching this.
4892080	4893080	I'm watching-
4893080	4894480	Like, I'm just gonna take it that next step further.
4894480	4897320	I'm watching this because I think they play really good football.
4897320	4899400	No, no one's believing that.
4899400	4900960	Yeah, so you're reading it for the articles.
4900960	4901960	Yes, of course.
4901960	4904200	I'm watching this for the articles.
4904200	4907920	You know, you know what would make, you know, getting away from, you know, sexy women for
4907920	4908920	a minute, you know what?
4908920	4911040	They should license into a game.
4911040	4912040	Puppy Bowl.
4912040	4913040	Yep.
4913040	4914040	They've already done that because-
4914040	4915040	Get out.
4915040	4916040	No, no, it's not Puppy Bowl.
4916040	4919480	But remember, there was, um, the, god, who was it?
4919480	4920840	It wasn't Joe Montana.
4920840	4923560	It was Jerry Rice Dog Football.
4923560	4928680	It came out on the Wii last year, about a year ago, actually, because I remember-
4928680	4929680	Okay.
4929680	4933360	Well, the problem is that was Joe Montana, who's kind of, you know, he's long-
4933360	4934360	It's Jerry Rice.
4934360	4935360	Oh, sorry.
4935360	4940960	Well, Jerry Rice also kind of, you know, it's, it's not that hot ass ref that they had on
4940960	4943680	the Puppy Bowl the past couple years.
4943680	4944680	Not this year.
4944680	4945680	And really, you know why I failed?
4945680	4946680	No kit in halftime.
4946680	4947680	So that-
4947680	4948680	Good point.
4948680	4949680	Good point.
4949680	4953760	Yeah, that night, his dog football was the, uh, game.
4953760	4957280	The talk about, you know, chicks and football and all this has me thinking about one of
4957280	4960360	my good friends, and, you know, I follow her on Facebook and all this.
4960360	4962280	She's getting really into roller derby lately.
4962280	4965400	Are there any good roller derby experiences on consoles?
4965400	4970960	You know, I want to say, I thought there was a roller derby game, but, uh, probably not.
4970960	4973080	I don't think there is a roller derby game.
4973080	4974080	Which is sad.
4974080	4975520	I mean, perhaps-
4975520	4977400	There's quite a roller derby audience, though.
4977400	4979280	She's got like a trading card and everything.
4979280	4980280	Perhaps.
4980280	4981280	Pretty cool.
4981280	4987240	You know, they will come out with one because, um, you know, there was, uh, there's been
4987240	4996320	plenty of games for, like, um, what was it, uh, uh, for lacrosse and, like, for rugby
4996320	4998960	and that kind of stuff, so maybe we'll see that.
4998960	5003920	Um, I am seeing, though, there is, uh, yeah, Jam City Roller Girls was actually a game
5003920	5005120	that came out.
5005120	5006120	Oh, okay.
5006120	5011480	Um, it was on, I think, the Wii?
5011480	5016240	Stan in our chat room says, you mean Asuka, who was, um, you know, she was the girl that
5016240	5020000	was on the tester who was on the show about, what, six months ago at this point?
5020000	5024840	Um, I follow her on Twitter, but not Facebook, and I forgot, she does roller derby, too,
5024840	5025840	that's right.
5025840	5027200	No, this is a different friend I'm thinking of, but-
5027200	5028200	Yes, WiiWare.
5028200	5033920	It was on WiiWare, Jam City Roller Girls is, it is an authentic, um, well, I don't know
5033920	5039200	how authentic, but it is a roller derby game, so, uh, they do have one.
5039200	5040680	All right.
5040680	5041680	There's one.
5041680	5043920	Which is, you know, they should have more than one.
5043920	5044920	It looks decent.
5044920	5047320	All right, let me move on.
5047320	5048320	I gotta go to this.
5048320	5049320	This is-
5049320	5056200	Oh, God, I just, I'm just gonna put this out there, and Alan, I'll wait for you to make
5056200	5059360	some smart-ass comments so you get ready, okay?
5059360	5063840	I don't even really want to plug the website by saying its name, but I'm gonna have to
5063840	5068280	too, so I want to just preface this by saying I ain't endorsing this shit, I just have to
5068280	5070800	report on how ludicrous it is, all right?
5070800	5076200	Um, there is a new website out there, and it's basically, from what it sounds like,
5076200	5079600	it's kind of like adult friend finder, but for gamers.
5079600	5083040	And it's called Shagga Gamer.
5083040	5084600	It's launched in the United Kingdom.
5084600	5085600	Sorry.
5085600	5086600	Really?
5086600	5087600	That's-
5087600	5088600	Sorry, yes.
5088600	5091320	I can't imagine that's in the United Kingdom with it being called Shagga Gamer, because
5091320	5093960	I don't believe anybody uses the phrase Shag.
5093960	5095480	Yes, they do.
5095480	5098240	Every time they see Austin Powers, they want to see Shagga Gamer.
5098240	5101680	Yes, Austin Powers, featuring a British spy.
5101680	5104440	Yeah, baby!
5104440	5111960	Wow, that's current, that's some current stuff there, current material you got working there.
5111960	5118880	Austin Powers, a franchise that hasn't been around for years now.
5118880	5123680	It is what they're calling the number one adult site for gamers.
5123680	5126480	Of course they're calling it, yeah, we're number one.
5126480	5128600	Well, who's their competition?
5128600	5129600	Exactly.
5129600	5133440	Who cares, I mean-
5133440	5138640	They're offering their services to thousands of single gamers who want nothing more than
5138640	5140240	a quick shag.
5140240	5143120	Yeah, baby.
5143120	5150800	For just 19.99 pounds a month, you get full access, this is a quote, quote, full access
5150800	5158160	to young, old, exciting, sexy individuals wanting no strings sex.
5158160	5162640	They're apparently coming soon as a Shagga Gamer TV as well.
5162640	5169520	No, no, I do want to say, and this is important in their quote, they do not mention female
5169520	5170520	gamers.
5170520	5173840	She needs to be all dudes.
5173840	5180600	So technically, yes, there are young, old gamers that want to have sex with no strings
5180600	5182920	attached, but they're all dudes.
5182920	5189720	The site continues, quote, quite simply, we are the best at matchmaking thousands of gamers.
5189720	5195240	We are the same people behind Data Gamer, and we are the UK's biggest destination for
5195240	5197300	single gamers and geeks.
5197300	5203000	So when users are looking for a site to find the hottest gamer girls or the biggest number
5203000	5207320	of gamers, that's why we are many people's number one choice.
5207320	5214360	Now, it should be said that you can follow Shagga Gamer on Twitter, and out of all those
5214360	5223080	thousands of people that are hooking up, they have 56 followers on their Twitter.
5223080	5228280	I believe the OLR Twitter has something like 700 or 800 followers.
5228280	5231480	So would it be fair to say that if suddenly we said, you know what, we don't want to be
5231480	5233680	just an internet radio show anymore.
5233680	5237260	We want to be a place for casual gamers to find a fuck.
5237260	5241520	We would be able to say now we are the number one company.
5241520	5244040	So suck it, Shagga Gamer.
5244040	5245040	There's a problem with that.
5245040	5248640	I don't give a fuck, so.
5248640	5250680	Alan?
5250680	5255120	This just makes me curious as to how many hookups happen at like E3 or PAX.
5255120	5256640	Like do people get laid at those cons?
5256640	5257640	I'm sure that PAX.
5257640	5258640	Oh, sure they do.
5258640	5263040	PAX, they actually, there's been articles where people will post Craigslist articles
5263040	5268700	or notifications, it's a meetup for an orgy, basically, at PAX, and they will do that.
5268700	5271160	So yes, they do that.
5271160	5275400	And anime cons, and I mean there's a lot of like geek sex going on, but.
5275400	5277800	Anything with a furry crossover, then yes, obviously.
5277800	5278800	Dragon Con?
5278800	5279800	Yeah.
5279800	5280800	I mean, but.
5280800	5282520	Why do you think all the guys from VoG are going?
5282520	5283520	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5283520	5288160	I don't mean stuff that's set up like that on Craigslist, but just, oh hey, I see you
5288160	5289160	at the Nintendogs.
5289160	5291280	Oh, I'm in that hotel too.
5291280	5292280	Room four?
5292280	5293280	I got some wine.
5293280	5299080	You know, they have a phrase for a reason, you know, a fool is money, you're easily parted.
5299080	5300700	Don't be a sucker.
5300700	5304960	Obviously there are not sites like this that are, there's just tons of hot gamer girls
5304960	5307740	just waiting around for someone to just fuck them.
5307740	5313640	Why aren't there any guys who the fuck me me misses attractive gaming loving girl with
5313640	5314640	big titties?
5314640	5318400	I'm sorry, that does not exist anywhere.
5318400	5323200	So what, you know, all these sites that want to charge you money and stuff like that.
5323200	5327320	Like for example, there's a perfect, what was it, remember the gaming one where you
5327320	5332200	would join up and you'd play, you play games with hot gaming girls and stuff like that,
5332200	5338640	and they would, you know, have video cam time with you and, um, they may undress somewhat
5338640	5341120	when you're playing the old battleship or something.
5341120	5345200	I don't know, Alan, I might shag that gamer.
5345200	5351760	That image on their splash page is hilarious because I can't tell if it's just a really
5351760	5357120	cheap stock image photo that they just photoshopped those shaggy gamer thing on his shirt or if
5357120	5358120	that's an actual photo shoot.
5358120	5359120	No, cause she has it too.
5359120	5360120	She has it too.
5360120	5361120	Yeah, I could shop that.
5361120	5362120	That would be hard.
5362120	5367520	That's a photo shoot that they had about as hard as that might be right there.
5367520	5368520	What am I pointing at?
5368520	5369520	Ellen?
5369520	5370520	I know.
5370520	5371520	Look how well defined that is.
5371520	5372520	She's, she's lifting his shirt.
5372520	5373520	Yeah.
5373520	5379360	I think that's a photo shot at his junk, I guess, but you don't need to lift his shirts.
5379360	5382840	I don't know what's going on in that picture, but then they show some of the actual users
5382840	5387240	of the site and like, you know, Paula 25 she's waiting to get shagged.
5387240	5388560	I'm sorry.
5388560	5389560	Okay.
5389560	5395880	Here's my question though.
5395880	5398000	What is so gamer about this?
5398000	5403640	I mean, is it like, you know, you want someone to fuck and then cuddle and play Skyrim with
5403640	5408520	after, like, can't you just go on OkCupid and set gamer tags as your match?
5408520	5411320	Like only show me people that have this filter.
5411320	5412320	That's what I'm thinking.
5412320	5413320	Yes, exactly.
5413320	5414320	You can do that.
5414320	5418720	Or there's even if you're looking to date somebody, there's even that geek to geek site,
5418720	5421240	which I hear is okay.
5421240	5425300	But you're better off, you know, with something like, you know, like an OkCupid or plenty
5425300	5430380	of fish or something like that, where it doesn't really cost you anything to do it because
5430380	5434280	these sites, they basically, oh yeah, it's free to sign up, free to sign up.
5434280	5437440	And then you sign up and then you're like, oh, I want to talk to this person.
5437440	5440000	I want to send them a message saying, yes, I would like to fuck you.
5440000	5441000	Oh, I'm sorry.
5441000	5442680	That's going to cost you money.
5442680	5444240	You're not a premium member.
5444240	5446680	And then you become a premium member.
5446680	5450080	So, uh, sorry, you're not blah, blah, blah.
5450080	5451840	You need more money to do this.
5451840	5452840	They put it this way.
5452840	5453840	You know what?
5453840	5457280	These people that they have, the models that they have here are not on their fucking site.
5457280	5458280	Okay.
5458280	5459280	Well, you know what they might do?
5459280	5461120	I bet, and I bet a lot of websites like this do this.
5461120	5463720	They probably partner with another site.
5463720	5466000	Like the women probably didn't sign up for the site.
5466000	5470860	The women signed up for some other site and the women signed up for a site that was like,
5470860	5474080	find a nerdy guy or find a rich guy or something like that.
5474080	5478320	Cause you know, all nerds are rich like, and I bet that's what it is.
5478320	5483080	They do something to lure the women in and there's something really tiny, really tiny
5483080	5488280	in the terms of agreement that is, Oh, your picture and profile may show up on our partner
5488280	5489880	websites.
5489880	5495500	So some of these women probably sign up for, you know, just, you know, fuck me and leave
5495500	5496960	me.com or whatever.
5496960	5498360	I don't know.
5498360	5500720	And suddenly they're on Shagga gamer.
5500720	5501720	I don't know.
5501720	5502720	All right.
5502720	5507160	I think we spent far too much time on this topic.
5507160	5508160	Yeah.
5508160	5509160	Just don't give them your time.
5509160	5512880	I mean, that's basically the moral of the story.
5512880	5515680	Go to Craigslist, but be careful.
5515680	5518880	Like there's some real freaky people on Craigslist.
5518880	5524240	Craigslist is just weird.
5524240	5527400	Let's go to a time when games were a lot simpler.
5527400	5538280	Back when we were innocent and we weren't thinking about such pervert things, the classic
5538280	5544240	game of the week, every week, dark Sakura goes into the vault and finds a classic game
5544240	5548760	that she deems worthy of you to revisit all over again.
5548760	5556440	But since she's at a wedding, Alan's here and he dug into the shoebox to find the classic
5556440	5558440	game that he thinks you all should play this week.
5558440	5564320	Alan was the classic game of the week, classic game of the week is a Lucas arts game on the
5564320	5566760	scum engine came out in 1993.
5566760	5569680	It is maniac mansion day of the tentacle.
5569680	5570680	Good pick.
5570680	5572720	Got any audio for me?
5572720	5576280	I'm getting some up right now.
5576280	5582480	Oh, this amazing intro.
5582480	5588360	So yes, this is the sequel to a previous classic game of the week, maniac mansion, which came
5588360	5589980	out in 1987.
5589980	5595240	You play Bernard, who was one of the cast members of the first game.
5595240	5604000	You are called back to the mansion by totally blanking on his name, Dr. Fred, because the
5604000	5609440	purple tentacle has drank some toxic sludge that made him super smart and he's going to
5609440	5615120	take over the world, so you and your two friends have to go back in time to prevent him from
5615120	5619440	drinking the slime and becoming super smart, but something goes horribly wrong with the
5619440	5627880	time machines that are made out of porta potties, they're modified porta potties.
5627880	5637880	Listen to the audio.
5637880	5645240	The main directors of this game were Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, who had worked on the adventures
5645240	5650500	of monkey island games, and they got their pedigree from that and Lucas Arts said, okay,
5650500	5654280	you guys are going to helm this game and it's the sequel to maniac mansion.
5654280	5659200	It's point and click style.
5659200	5663940	They fixed the engine that they used in this for Sam and Max Hit the Road, which was the
5663940	5670440	other game I was debating using tonight, but yeah, so you've got give, pick up, use, push,
5670440	5674420	look at, open, and you just click that, you click on your verb and then you click on what
5674420	5677000	you want and you interact with the puzzles that way.
5677000	5683560	Bernard stays in present day, his sort of overweight rocker friend, very hair metal.
5683560	5689000	Hoagie goes into the future and then she's kind of a Daria Morgendorfer, Ally Sheedy
5689000	5691820	in the Breakfast Club, kind of spazzy girl.
5691820	5698280	She goes back in time to the colonial ages, or do I have that backwards, I forget.
5698280	5702280	She goes to the future, Hoagie goes to the past, that's right, sorry, I haven't played
5702280	5705980	this game in years, but it's super awesome.
5705980	5710480	They went and looked at a bunch of Warner Brothers cartoons for the visual, like how
5710480	5714240	they wanted to do the art direction, and also a lot of the sound effects are taken directly
5714240	5717480	from the cartoons as well.
5717480	5722560	And yeah, it's got Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are some of the cameos that Hoagie
5722560	5730420	has to deal with in the past, and it has a great endgame when it all comes together and
5730420	5734480	all the three characters are joined again, it's just a lot of fun.
5734480	5740000	This game also was one of the first few CD games, for one it was a computer game that
5740000	5745440	came out on CD-ROM and also had full voice acting, which at the time, I think, King's
5745440	5750300	Quest V, the Sierra game which came out I think in 91 also had voice acting, but a lot
5750300	5751680	of it was really bad.
5751680	5758080	The voice acting in these LucasArts games, even though for the early 90s, are phenomenal.
5758080	5762000	Amazing voice acting considering that it was new technology, because when this came out
5762000	5767160	on PC and PC were just getting talky video games, we were playing the Super Nintendo
5767160	5770960	for about a year or two, because that came out in 91 to just show the timeline of how
5770960	5774060	the technology was.
5774060	5781220	But yeah, I actually installed, I still have this, I have the original instruction booklet
5781220	5785600	and the disc, and I installed DOSBox on my Windows 7 machine so I could play this in
5785600	5786600	Sam & Max.
5786600	5790440	Does this come on LucasArts' pack that's on Steam?
5790440	5794000	Good old games has it, I want to say.
5794000	5795000	I don't know about Steam.
5795000	5799160	I remember there was some type of LucasArts mega pack of adventure games it was on, that's
5799160	5802440	how you could get Loom and shit.
5802440	5807480	And for people who are into emulators, DOSBox is just, you still need the game with DOSBox,
5807480	5811920	but if you have SCUM, SCUM is also an emulator specifically for LucasArts games that run
5811920	5812920	on this engine.
5812920	5816480	ActDeft clarifies, nope, it isn't on Steam at all.
5816480	5820000	So it is not a part of that pack, go figure.
5820000	5823960	Also some other comments on this game, Burr says, Day of the Tentacle is the best adventure
5823960	5825600	game ever.
5825600	5830080	Dungeon Buster says, this was LucasArts at the height of Awesome 2.
5830080	5834200	This and Sam & Max, I don't want to try to put one over the other, but both of those
5834200	5841640	games together are just phenomenal adventure games for that era of PC gaming.
5841640	5845360	Anything else you want to say about Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle?
5845360	5847360	Uh, hilarious.
5847360	5851520	One of the funniest games they've ever played aside from Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity,
5851520	5856000	which I'm sorry, my judge wrote the script, it's a hilarious game.
5856000	5859520	You'll have to pick that next time.
5859520	5869480	And I want to say, I'm trying to find the actual site for this rumor, but I think it
5869480	5877640	might be Telltale Games, but someone somewhere wants to put out an episodic franchise that
5877640	5881240	exists in the same universe that references Day of the Tentacle.
5881240	5885300	I could see that, because as much as people loved this game, nothing ever really came
5885300	5886300	after it, you know?
5886300	5888640	Yeah, no, Maniac Mansion 3, do you think we'd get?
5888640	5893040	Well, LucasArts has been all about, literally, Star Wars games, for what?
5893040	5896360	Pretty much since, once this era ended, they've just been about Star Wars, really.
5896360	5901480	And Grim Fandango was their last big splash in PC adventure games.
5901480	5904960	But yeah, super awesome, people should check it out.
5904960	5909560	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Maniac Mansion 2, Day of the Tentacle,
5909560	5911880	or just Day of the Tentacle for short.
5911880	5913240	Thank you, Alan, good pick.
5913240	5915280	A good PC adventure game.
5915280	5919160	Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys, we have plenty more
5919160	5924800	show when we come back, including rapid fire news, and we're gonna revisit Xbox security
5924800	5925800	again.
5925800	5928880	But this time, it might not be as much ranting as it's been in the past.
5928880	5939640	We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5939640	5945720	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on Sunday, July the 22nd of 2012,
5945720	5949600	with episode number 466 of our show.
5949600	5954080	DarkSakura, not here tonight, she is at a wedding in Las Vegas, the wedding of Tiara
5954080	5960240	and Dan from Geek-Life.com, and we want to, once again, wish them a very happy wedding.
5960240	5965040	I see the pictures are starting to show up on Facebook, and all I can say is, aw.
5965040	5972080	Alright, I promised a giveaway here in part B, and again, this is a code generously donated
5972080	5976960	to the show by Bashka, and you can visit his website, critcraft.blogspot.com, if you like
5976960	5979120	World of Warcraft stuff.
5979120	5982360	Even if you don't, he tends to have some, you know, some other little gaming things
5982360	5986080	that sneak in there, too, and the types of stuff that a lot of OLR people, I bet, would
5986080	5987840	be really into.
5987840	5992760	What we are giving away, once again, it is a beta key for Ravaged.
5992760	5998440	This is, I can play this little gameplay trailer here that he sent me there on the Facebooks.
5998440	6000760	I guess there's some gameplay in this trailer here.
6000760	6007120	It's a first-person shooter that is set in a world ravaged by a polar shift pitting scavengers
6007120	6014200	versus the resistance, so as soon as this ad finishes playing, I'll play a little clip
6014200	6017680	of the gameplay trailer, and we're going to give this away right now to somebody that
6017680	6023880	is checked in at vognetwork.com and in our chat room, and of course, wants the code,
6023880	6027200	because I'm going to send them a private message and be like, are you going to use this code?
6027200	6032200	And if they, uh, they don't, then I'll give away to somebody else.
6032200	6033200	I remember this one.
6033200	6034200	Yeah, it looks like a lot.
6034200	6038200	This is the game that was supposed to be like Rage, you know, how Rage is supposed to be.
6038200	6041800	It's, you know, like fighting and bugging.
6041800	6046160	Lots of like, do-buggies, planes, that type of stuff.
6046160	6048280	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
6048280	6051880	Might want a pretty decent computer in order to play this.
6051880	6055280	All right, let's see who we're going to give that away to.
6055280	6057240	We're going to do this live right now.
6057240	6060940	What I'm doing right now, I'm pulling up the list of people that are currently checked
6060940	6062440	into the show.
6062440	6068120	All right, so I need you, Loki, you checked in.
6068120	6069320	Are you trying to win this too?
6069320	6071320	No, I'm just checking all the time.
6071320	6073760	All right, pick a number between one and 30.
6073760	6077160	Uh, Alan, pick a number between one and 30.
6077160	6078160	23.
6078160	6079160	23.
6079160	6080160	So that's 31-39-87-6543.
6080160	6089200	I want to see if that person is in chat right now.
6089200	6092200	Hopefully they have a similar name or I might not be able to identify them.
6092200	6095800	I think you can just Google a random number generator and put in the one to 30.
6095800	6098120	It's more fun if I ask you.
6098120	6104560	Uh, I'm looking, I don't see that person in chat right now.
6104560	6107040	Looking one more time.
6107040	6108360	Just making sure.
6108360	6111960	Okay, yeah, that person isn't in chat right now.
6111960	6112960	So give me another number.
6112960	6113960	12.
6113960	6114960	12.
6114960	6120680	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
6120680	6123440	I'm pretty sure this person is in chat.
6123440	6124720	It's Raginator.
6124720	6129080	Let me see if he wants it.
6129080	6136400	Okay, I'll let you guys know in a minute if Raginator is going to take the code or if
6136400	6138880	somebody else will walk away with it.
6138880	6140160	So I just sent him a private message.
6140160	6144520	All right, let's move on in the meantime to rapid fire news.
6144520	6145520	Loki.
6145520	6146520	All right.
6146520	6151120	So, um, as I mentioned, I was playing a game called, uh, you know, I want to be the guy
6151120	6155160	Gaiden, uh, that's finally been released now, so you can check it out.
6155160	6156200	It's a little buggy.
6156200	6161420	It's just the first of a few episodic games that are going to be put out, but I mean,
6161420	6164240	it's pretty hard, so it'll have to do.
6164240	6170600	It's three levels long and you can check it out on, um, GameJolt has it, uh, so just go
6170600	6175560	to GameJolt.com and look in their freeware section and they've got, you know, I want
6175560	6177160	to be the guy Gaiden.
6177160	6178560	It's pretty easy to find.
6178560	6186940	Or you can go to, uh, Kaylin's, uh, or can site, uh, K A Y I N dot P Y O K O, uh, dot
6186940	6192480	org slash I W B T G. I want to be the guy.
6192480	6193800	So there you go.
6193800	6196320	You can find all the information on that and it's pretty cool.
6196320	6197600	So check it out.
6197600	6199480	Um, this is kind of funny.
6199480	6203880	You know, the game, uh, Tokyo jungle, the one that's basically a bunch of animals surviving
6203880	6205680	in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo.
6205680	6207160	It looked awesome.
6207160	6208160	It looked awesome.
6208160	6211680	Well, they're even making it a little, uh, stranger.
6211680	6216640	They're adding Japanese businessmen to the game.
6216640	6223680	There's DLC that's, uh, coming out that you can play as a salary man and you can, uh,
6223680	6226160	well, businessman can be pretty Savage too.
6226160	6227160	Let's be real.
6227160	6231360	So you can play the game and God, I hope you don't have to mate them.
6231360	6232360	That's going to be weird.
6232360	6235400	Uh, but yes, so I'll be coming out.
6235400	6238200	I'm looking forward to the game when it finally makes it over here.
6238200	6242720	Uh, act deft and chat says, isn't it being localized for the U S yes, yes it is.
6242720	6243720	It is.
6243720	6247760	Uh, Ray dear at a live.vog network.com says, I want to be the guy.
6247760	6248760	Damn it.
6248760	6252920	I'm sure that's what a lot of people say playing that game.
6252920	6259080	And then finally Manos, the hands of fate is coming out on iOS.
6259080	6265120	They're making an eight bit type game for it and it is a 2d platform or it's a very
6265120	6270940	retro and maybe we'll be on other platforms other than iOS at some point, but of course
6270940	6275960	has all the, you know, infamous stuff from the series.
6275960	6279840	And if you're not familiar with Manos stands of fate, but it's one of the worst movies
6279840	6284160	ever made, you know, how bad is it?
6284160	6285160	It's pretty bad.
6285160	6289680	I've fallen asleep twice with trying to watch it once, uh, both times with, uh, mr.
6289680	6290680	Sand, Seager 3000.
6290680	6291680	Oh wow.
6291680	6292680	And it was still bad.
6292680	6295200	It was still so bad that I fell asleep.
6295200	6299400	All right, well, let's move on to some other stories.
6299400	6302240	First up, rock band blitz finally has a release date.
6302240	6305960	Uh, they said it would come out this summer and we're already about halfway through summer.
6305960	6312600	Well, we finally have a date for at PlayStation, August 28th, X-Box live, uh, a day later,
6312600	6319040	August 29th, that's going to cost you 15 bucks for this game and some more songs were revealed
6319040	6320040	for the game.
6320040	6321040	We'll, that will be in the game.
6321040	6325920	Cool and the gang's jungle boogie, my chemical romances sing funds.
6325920	6326920	We are young.
6326920	6332040	And that's like the song that won't go away off the radio at all, um, Avenged Sevenfold
6332040	6333820	so far away also there.
6333820	6335840	And a lot of people very excited about this.
6335840	6340800	It uses all the DLC from rock band that you might have built up on your hard drive.
6340800	6343840	And if you're like me, you have a lot.
6343840	6347560	So it's pretty cool that you'll be able to use this in the game as well.
6347560	6348960	Very cool.
6348960	6355320	Uh, now, uh, Portal 2, if you've beaten Portal 2, then the joke, I'm in space, makes sense
6355320	6356320	to you.
6356320	6358520	If not, welp, sorry, I'm not going to spoil you, you'll just have to go back and beat
6358520	6359520	it.
6359520	6363160	But what's kind of funny is that things are about to get really meta because NASA is going
6363160	6365920	to send Portal 2 to space.
6365920	6366920	That's right.
6366920	6373080	An anonymous tech at NASA laser engraved the space core on a part that is going to be flying
6373080	6376560	on a resupply craft to the International Space Station.
6376560	6380040	Valve posted about it on their official Portal blog on Friday.
6380040	6381960	Uh, they don't know who did it.
6381960	6384160	It was an anonymous tech at NASA.
6384160	6389900	NASA did not endorse this, but it's happening because they actually laser engraved this
6389900	6393520	little Wheatley in space.
6393520	6395520	It's not Wheatley, it's a core.
6395520	6397200	Yeah, it's a space core.
6397200	6398920	It's the one that's in the Skyrim thing.
6398920	6399920	Space.
6399920	6400920	Space.
6400920	6401920	Space.
6401920	6402920	Space.
6402920	6403920	Space.
6403920	6404920	What is that Wheatley at the end of the game?
6404920	6405920	He eventually went in the space.
6405920	6406920	Oh, okay.
6406920	6408240	He was all emo about it.
6408240	6409240	All right, whatever.
6409240	6410240	Oh, that's right.
6410240	6411240	Okay.
6411240	6412240	Yeah, right.
6412240	6413240	I'm okay.
6413240	6414240	Yeah.
6414240	6415240	Wheatley's emo about it.
6415240	6416240	And then there's the other guy in the background.
6416240	6417240	Yeah.
6417240	6418240	Yeah.
6418240	6419240	Yeah.
6419240	6420240	It's been a little while since I beat Portal 2.
6420240	6421240	I beat it when it first came out.
6421240	6422240	So anyhow.
6422240	6423240	And if you're going to kill me because I gave a little spoiler there, you know what?
6423240	6425680	Game's been out a year and it's been on sale for like five bucks lately.
6425680	6429760	So I'm thinking you haven't played it at this point.
6429760	6435600	Um, also lastly, uh, EA gets a lot of hate.
6435600	6437560	But they did something that's pretty cool this week.
6437560	6443280	Um, they joined Microsoft, Viacom, Google, Zynga, another company gets a lot of hate,
6443280	6445720	and eBay on this that's pretty cool.
6445720	6451660	It is a amicus brief that declares opposition to DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which
6451660	6454820	legally defines marriage between a man and a woman.
6454820	6459380	And EA in a press release said, quote, DOMA presents a number of problems for businesses
6459380	6465020	like EA as it creates regulatory tax and discrimination complications for employers.
6465020	6466840	And that's why we're standing against it.
6466840	6471240	The underlying lawsuit impacts all employers, no matter how big or small, and no matter
6471240	6472240	the industry.
6472240	6475480	And we encourage other businesses to join these efforts.
6475480	6476480	And that's pretty cool.
6476480	6479960	EA's, um, been pretty supportive of LGBT causes in the past.
6479960	6484000	They actually marched in the Pride Parade in San Francisco and in Seattle.
6484000	6488840	They've done their own It Gets Better campaign video that's available on YouTube as well.
6488840	6493860	So a little less evil doing the right thing and standing against DOMA, which obviously
6493860	6497580	we here at OLR also think is kind of crap.
6497580	6502720	So let's move on with some more stories.
6502720	6509520	The Los Angeles comedy club Laugh Factory, which is world famous, I think the first stand-up
6509520	6516060	comedian that ever performed there was Richard Pryor, Dave Chappelle, and has done like six
6516060	6517240	hour sets there.
6517240	6518840	So yes, world famous.
6518840	6521720	They have a charity to help kids and all this stuff.
6521720	6528840	They are coming out with a streaming channel for PS3 on PlayStation Network, PS3 only from
6528840	6529840	this story.
6529840	6534560	$3 a month if you're a stand-up comedy nerd like myself and you listen to stand-up comic
6534560	6540040	podcasts like Greg Proops and Aisha Tyler like I do, you might like this.
6540040	6545400	I know stand-up comedy isn't really as relevant now as it was in the 90s, but yeah, Laugh
6545400	6549040	Factory, Los Angeles Club, $3 a month.
6549040	6552520	Both pre-recorded and live performances from stand-ups.
6552520	6558440	No real schedule yet on the content, but if you're a comedy nerd, you've got $3 a month
6558440	6559440	to burn.
6559440	6560440	It's kind of neat.
6560440	6561440	Something different.
6561440	6562440	Yeah.
6562440	6565080	Although you can get it for free through some of those other podcasts you mentioned.
6565080	6566080	Yeah.
6566080	6567080	Well that's, yeah.
6567080	6574360	And then also the Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio, very funky, amazing cell shaded game
6574360	6583480	is coming to iOS and Android this summer to compliment the PC and Vita versions.
6583480	6589280	So I remember the Dreamcast one, the original, and it was an amazing game.
6589280	6593420	It eventually got too hard for me to like, I think by the time I unlocked the fourth
6593420	6596880	or fifth character, it just got so hard I couldn't do it anymore.
6596880	6604120	The learning curve for the controls was when you got it, you got it, but it took a while.
6604120	6608720	I cannot imagine how this is going to play on a touch screen unless they really tweak
6608720	6609720	the controls.
6609720	6616760	But yeah, funky Jet Set Radio goodness coming to your phones this summer.
6616760	6617760	All right.
6617760	6621520	Before we get into the Fugu question of the week, guess what, Raginator never responded,
6621520	6623160	meaning he's not there.
6623160	6628160	And I seem to recall he said his PC is kind of challenged anyway, so I am regretfully
6628160	6630240	going to have to pass the code to somebody else.
6630240	6632680	So once again, I need a number between one and 30.
6632680	6635960	Uh, hold on.
6635960	6636960	What are you looking?
6636960	6637960	No, don't.
6637960	6638960	Just say something.
6638960	6639960	Don't Google it.
6639960	6640960	17.
6640960	6641960	17.
6641960	6642960	All right.
6642960	6645960	So if Raginator was 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
6645960	6646960	All right.
6646960	6649680	I know that person's in chat and I know he'll respond.
6649680	6661240	That is VX Jason XV is number 17 to check in tonight.
6661240	6668360	Hold on by me, by me a little time here, guys, while I send Jason a private message.
6668360	6669360	Does he PC game?
6669360	6671560	Cause he might be like, Hey, PC games.
6671560	6673560	I think he does.
6673560	6675080	Yeah, he does.
6675080	6676080	So all right.
6676080	6680280	Now I will give Jason like five minutes to respond and if he doesn't respond either,
6680280	6682200	then we'll move on to somebody else.
6682200	6683200	All right.
6683200	6684200	All right.
6684200	6689000	Uh, we're going to get into the Fugu question of the week here.
6689000	6693800	Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and our Google plus, put them together
6693800	6696280	and you get Fugu.
6696280	6698320	I don't have the music queued up this week.
6698320	6699320	Sorry.
6699320	6703880	But, um, we read some, some of the responses here on the air.
6703880	6706800	I don't think we'll get through all of them.
6706800	6710920	There was a lot of responses tonight and there's no way I'm going to be able to read all of
6710920	6711920	these.
6711920	6715760	Please, please check out our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange launch radio
6715760	6717340	and our Google plus.
6717340	6720160	There's a few responses over there too, believe it or not.
6720160	6722560	Uh, I, I don't have a URL for it.
6722560	6723960	One one zero nine four.
6723960	6724960	No, I'm just kidding.
6724960	6725960	I'm not going to read the whole thing.
6725960	6727360	Just go to Google plus and search for orange launch radio.
6727360	6728720	You'll find us there.
6728720	6731080	Here's the question of the week.
6731080	6735880	Kind of a tricky question because obviously there was a lot of really tough stuff that
6735880	6737200	happened over the weekend.
6737200	6741200	You know, just a lot of really unfortunate events.
6741200	6747280	And when tragedy like this happens, unfortunately people like to point the finger at video games.
6747280	6752280	And so I wanted to ask this question to our Facebook and Google communities and that is
6752280	6757280	sometimes when tragedy happens, commentators on big news channels are quick to blame video
6757280	6760240	games for a person being so deranged.
6760240	6765280	What if anything can we do as a gaming community to stop this reputation and show that there
6765280	6770040	are far more good people playing video games than bad?
6770040	6775400	You know, because when that incident happened in Aurora, you know, over the weekend, which
6775400	6781120	was terrible, they splash that guy all over the news as the news tends to do, which is
6781120	6785240	really unfortunate because they're just making him famous by doing that, which I hate.
6785240	6789500	But you know, it should be the victims we should be remembering, but anyhow, they always
6789500	6793960	bring these commentators on because everybody wants to know, why do you do it?
6793960	6794960	Why do you do it?
6794960	6795960	What was going on in his head?
6795960	6798400	He was a quiet kid and he went crazy.
6798400	6799400	Why do you do it?
6799400	6800400	Why do you do it?
6800400	6805360	And somebody always inevitably says video games, you know, which is ridiculous.
6805360	6806360	Yeah.
6806360	6809880	The problem with the video game, blame video games is it's as common now to be playing
6809880	6811540	video games as the watch TV.
6811540	6813200	So you can blame TV now too.
6813200	6817600	Well, I mean, or you could, it was that rock music he was listening to, it was those comics
6817600	6818600	he was reading.
6818600	6821500	It was, you know, the TV he was watching is the movies he's watching.
6821500	6828200	It was the drugs and some people blame Batman because he said when he got arrested or whatever
6828200	6829880	that he was the joker.
6829880	6832200	You know, it was the goddamn Batman.
6832200	6836240	You know who, you know, who is to blame him.
6836240	6838120	That's it.
6838120	6842720	There was a fake article that circulated on Tumblr the night that it happened saying that
6842720	6847740	he was arrested in like joker cosplay for, and which of course is full of shit.
6847740	6848740	Not true.
6848740	6854560	But it's like, why are people photoshopping fake newspapers to troll like literally an
6854560	6857320	hour after it happened saying that he was dressed as the joker?
6857320	6861960	Well, something about, I mean, again, I don't like talking about him, but I will entertain
6861960	6866160	that something about he, there was a picture of him with crazy hair that was on the internet.
6866160	6870720	Again, anything could be photoshopped, I guess, but well, it was on his, uh, adult friend
6870720	6871720	finder.
6871720	6873280	Oh, it's those sexual deviants.
6873280	6874280	All right.
6874280	6875880	Look, no, it was him.
6875880	6877200	It was his fault.
6877200	6878200	He did it.
6878200	6880200	I mean, whatever.
6880200	6881720	Anyway, two words.
6881720	6882720	Fuck him.
6882720	6883720	All right.
6883720	6884720	Let's get to though.
6884720	6887640	How do we keep the bad reputation off of gamers?
6887640	6890960	Because there's far more good people playing video games than there are bad.
6890960	6893080	Let me go to some of the answers on Facebook.
6893080	6894360	Read the haze starts us off.
6894360	6899480	The first thing we should do is not get online and attack the people who blame video games
6899480	6901440	because it just proves them right.
6901440	6902880	Think before you act.
6902880	6907480	We need to bring ourselves out there and show our positive side and drown out the negative
6907480	6908480	noise.
6908480	6912960	Make a YouTube video or write up on how we are productive members of society.
6912960	6914880	Just don't be an asshole on the internet.
6914880	6916760	It's as simple as that.
6916760	6920920	Or don't watch those news programs because they're sensationalists to get people to watch
6920920	6921920	them.
6921920	6927080	Ronnie B says, usually it's the news media, so I'd ask them how is their constant coverage
6927080	6932680	endorsement of graphic stories 24-7 any less likely to drive someone mad than a video game?
6932680	6936960	Even if the results of a tragic event is inspired by a video game, what can you do when the
6936960	6938600	person is a grown adult?
6938600	6942880	There is already the ESRB in the US, so I don't think you can really blame video games
6942880	6945560	anymore, and I think that's the best argument.
6945560	6946560	You know, that's true.
6946560	6950840	A lot of people are driven to this sort of insanity because they think it's going to
6950840	6953960	make them famous, and I guess in some ways it does.
6953960	6957440	And I'm always reminded of this.
6957440	6962360	In Sacramento, we had a really unfortunate case where a guy shot people at a Jack in
6962360	6963360	the Box.
6963360	6967800	I mean, just, you know, another just crazy asshole goes into a store and shoots people.
6967800	6972120	And part of the reason he did it was he said, I want to be famous.
6972120	6974420	I know I'm going to be plastered all over the news.
6974420	6975420	I'm going to be famous.
6975420	6976420	I'm going to be the most famous.
6976420	6978360	And like, he said that.
6978360	6986040	Well, in this interesting, ironic twist, that all happened on September 10th, 2001.
6986040	6990200	So he wasn't famous for very long because the media hopped right onto something else.
6990200	6992240	Well, he got his 15 minutes.
6992240	6995400	I mean, and it's just like, I'm not trying to be funny.
6995400	7000920	It's just this really hugely ironic thing, and it just kind of points out, I mean, God,
7000920	7004200	I hate using that word in conjunction with such tragedy, but you guys know, you know
7004200	7005520	what I'm getting at.
7005520	7012200	It's that he, you know, was driven by fame.
7012200	7013200	Attention whores.
7013200	7014200	That's what they are.
7014200	7015200	Yes, right here.
7015200	7021360	Um, let's see, uh, Clover N. Responds saying, promote all the charities connected to video
7021360	7022360	gaming.
7022360	7025200	I said, vampire says nothing.
7025200	7030580	It's a waste of time trying to educate our tar to scapegoat.
7030580	7031580	They do it on purpose.
7031580	7034080	They do it on purpose because it's a sensational thing.
7034080	7035240	It gets viewers.
7035240	7037040	That's all in the end of the day.
7037040	7039640	That's all the news programs want is they want more viewers.
7039640	7043380	So whether that means recording or, you know, covering the news story first or covering
7043380	7047080	the most in centralized way, that's really what it is.
7047080	7052000	They want viewership, so they get paid, add money, the end.
7052000	7057280	Why not 18 is nine responds and says, parents, it's not the only solution, but a start on
7057280	7059160	knowing what your kids are playing.
7059160	7063360	If there's a problem with the kid's brain, then a video game might be the start of stifling
7063360	7064360	the problem.
7064360	7065360	I could be wrong though.
7065360	7066920	Great show guys.
7066920	7074880	Um, Pika Uno says, as someone who works in the media, I can say it's not our, the gamers
7074880	7076280	parentheses fault.
7076280	7080680	The news is now an entertainment show and entertainment shows need a running narrative.
7080680	7085220	It's so much easier to just give the public what they want, an obvious scapegoat rather
7085220	7088680	than to think about how the news itself is propagating this.
7088680	7093320	If you're really interested in how TV really works from an insider's point of view, I urge
7093320	7099020	you to watch Charlie Brooker's screen wipe, news wipe, and games wipe on YouTube.
7099020	7103480	Very interesting comment from Pika Uno, kind of from the inside.
7103480	7107280	Last one from Facebook, Cody T says, what we could do to get the media and other people
7107280	7111520	blaming video games to understand that these people that act out in a violent way are not
7111520	7113920	doing so because of video games, movies, et cetera.
7113920	7117880	It has a lot to do with the thoughts they had from the time they were born.
7117880	7119560	Some people to me are just bad apples.
7119560	7123640	It has nothing to do with video games, movies, or any kind of medium like that.
7123640	7128340	It's just easy for the media to pick an outside cause to what was actually in this person's
7128340	7130020	mind their whole life.
7130020	7135200	So in conclusion, there is no good or even great way to get media to stop blaming it
7135200	7137760	on video games because media is media.
7137760	7144980	And at the end of the day, true gamers know that it is not true.
7144980	7145980	Complicated issue.
7145980	7147060	Before I go to Google, Alan?
7147060	7152760	With all the, you know, with Chris Hardwick's franchise Nerdist and all this stuff, the
7152760	7157160	progress that gamers have made with like PAX and just crossing into the mainstream and
7157160	7165880	being more of an accessible thing for, you know, it's not as niche as it once was.
7165880	7170660	But the reality is that it's still considered for the people like ages 45 and older who
7170660	7174160	watch the news, who get really, you know, into this stuff.
7174160	7176320	It's still a part of the counterculture, I guess.
7176320	7179380	It's still something that a lot of people can't relate to.
7179380	7182880	That makes it a magnet like Loki was saying about the sensationalism.
7182880	7187800	If he was a huge sports nut who was a jock who got like super late in high school and
7187800	7194220	he was just a big sports freak and did not even own a console, like they wouldn't pursue
7194220	7196840	that angle because that's considered normal.
7196840	7201280	They would pursue it as he was a sexual deviant because he had an adult friend finder profile.
7201280	7207760	They would say, okay, well, what's the first thing we can find that's even a little bit
7207760	7211100	like not as bland and as mainstream as possible?
7211100	7214200	Video games is often that thing because a lot of people over a certain age don't understand
7214200	7215200	it.
7215200	7216200	Let me ask this question.
7216200	7221680	And I'm taking a devil's advocate angle because I think a lot of the sensationalism happens
7221680	7226360	because we just want to understand as a society, why?
7226360	7228160	Why did this happen?
7228160	7230240	Why did evil?
7230240	7231640	There's no other word to describe it.
7231640	7233760	Why did evil happen?
7233760	7236960	Where did we as a society fail to allow this to happen?
7236960	7237960	Well, they keep it.
7237960	7240240	Here's the other thing too, is they keep saying he operated on his own, but how do you get
7240240	7241240	in the theater?
7241240	7244240	How do you get through the bought a ticket?
7244240	7245240	You had to suit up though.
7245240	7246240	Right?
7246240	7247240	Did you hear what they got up to?
7247240	7250840	Worrying how, where's he going to hide an air of 15 regardless.
7250840	7254440	I mean, I believe I had heard something in red online.
7254440	7259180	He used an emergency exit to go to his car and prompt it open so that he could get back
7259180	7261000	in the theater regardless.
7261000	7265600	The guy had his house booby trapped to the nines to try and kill some policemen too.
7265600	7269160	I mean, he was clearly deranged in all sorts of way.
7269160	7270600	He thought of a way.
7270600	7271960	He thought of a way.
7271960	7273000	So whatever.
7273000	7277800	I mean, but again, let me go back to the devil's advocate question.
7277800	7281760	What's wrong with wanting to know where did we fail as a society?
7281760	7285100	Well, that's the difficult question.
7285100	7291640	The easy question is to just say, this terrifies me and I'm confused and hurting and this is
7291640	7296360	a horrible story, but the media is saying that it's video games and I'm old and I've
7296360	7299880	never played those and I don't know anyone who plays those so I can see better at night
7299880	7303240	knowing that it's that evil yucky thing that's influencing people to do this.
7303240	7307920	It's the quickest way to get people to like they need to associate something because they
7307920	7309840	just they don't understand it.
7309840	7315320	And it's unfortunate that video games is often used because it's a billion dollar industry.
7315320	7316700	It's everywhere.
7316700	7320720	People will pay attention if you obviously lie and say bullshitty things about the industry
7320720	7325960	that aren't true because people that play games know that it's not like that.
7325960	7331200	But people are desperate for an easy answer to feel better about the grief that they feel
7331200	7332200	when they hear stories like this.
7332200	7333800	I think that's a very valid answer.
7333800	7335200	I think you're right on the money with that.
7335200	7336200	I think you're right.
7336200	7340500	I think a lot of this tends to you know help people it's all to help people sleep better
7340500	7346040	at night because hope it doesn't happen to them.
7346040	7349200	You know because already people are like well was he mentally ill?
7349200	7352100	Had he tried to get help before and then he was denied help?
7352100	7355920	You know there are all these existential questions about what drives a person to do this but
7355920	7360860	people need like they're like oh shit this like I'm terrified this is a horrible story.
7360860	7365640	If they can just make that mental association of oh he was influenced because of this maybe
7365640	7369300	and that's scary and weird because I'm old and I know I don't know what that is.
7369300	7371520	They can they can get that.
7371520	7375000	They can pin their terror to something.
7375000	7383000	And because I think there is a youth angle to video games that's a good go to for the
7383000	7384640	media if I'm making sense.
7384640	7385640	Absolutely.
7385640	7386640	No you are.
7386640	7387640	Absolutely.
7387640	7388640	Absolutely.
7388640	7390400	Osfer in chat says me and my mom went and saw the midnight showing of The Dark Knight
7390400	7391400	Rises.
7391400	7395440	A lot of people told us that they were glad that we were okay but I just shrugged it off.
7395440	7398640	I'm not going to let one guy ruin my movie going experience.
7398640	7402480	It's also funny how now when I tell people they should see the movie they tell me that
7402480	7404480	they don't want to get shot.
7404480	7405480	Absolutely ridiculous.
7405480	7406480	Which I agree with.
7406480	7413940	It had I mean unfortunately I mean what short term memory those people have because it's
7413940	7415840	really unfortunate.
7415840	7420600	Evil people killed people while they were working on 9-11.
7420600	7425620	Evil people have shot people on college campuses and on high school campuses.
7425620	7428000	Evil people have gone into fast food restaurants and shot people.
7428000	7430800	I mean it doesn't it doesn't matter where you are.
7430800	7434720	I mean that's just the sad reality of the situation.
7434720	7438480	To blame the movie and say I'm not going to go see a midnight movie because I might get
7438480	7446240	shot is incredibly ignorant and disrespectful of all the history that came before.
7446240	7447240	I think.
7447240	7448240	Right?
7448240	7449240	Am I right?
7449240	7450240	Maybe?
7450240	7454040	You're more likely to get a heart attack from that bucket of popcorn than you are to get
7454040	7455960	shot at the movie theater.
7455960	7461560	It doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right that that happened or we should forgive it
7461560	7463720	or shrug it off as well.
7463720	7464720	People getting shot.
7464720	7466000	That's just something that happens.
7466000	7467880	I'm not saying that.
7467880	7473080	We need we still strive as a society to figure out where where were the warning signs so
7473080	7476240	we can catch it before this happens again.
7476240	7478560	How do we stop it from happening again.
7478560	7486000	Anyhow going to Google Plus quickly Wendy S. on Google Plus says we should point out
7486000	7490080	that millions of people play these games and with the number of people playing games pointing
7490080	7495320	out that the bad guy played games is saying is like saying he watched TV they did in fact
7495320	7500120	mention the bad guy in this case played role playing fantasy games ridiculous point in
7500120	7504520	that millions play Skyrim or wow I have to agree with Mike which I'll read in a minute
7504520	7508960	here that acting like ladies and gentlemen online and not accepting people being jerks
7508960	7513400	will help as well so let me go to that comment from Act Def that said well for starters stop
7513400	7519080	acting like dicks on online games or when gaming other people in general second stop
7519080	7522680	acting like you're a badass know it all just because you play first person shooter games
7522680	7527120	though this applies to other games to also educate the other people that aren't playing
7527120	7531240	video games and pretty much state to them that video games do not cause violence and
7531240	7536560	especially to parents proper education stops this kind of action luckily most people have
7536560	7540960	stopped blaming video games for this type of situations at least in a general sense
7540960	7547140	I'm a couple more comments quickly entertainment says we can point out how even the most level
7547140	7551800	headed and accepted comments can be wrong for example one of the most widely quoted
7551800	7555960	statements from Bowling for Columbine was by Marilyn Manson he said that he wouldn't
7555960	7561080	say anything to the people who executed the Columbine attacks he would listen to them
7561080	7565960	in David Cullen's book Columbine which in a review of the book is called the 9-11 Commission
7565960	7572040	report for this tragedy a psychologist who treated Dylan Klebold's dismissed Manson comment
7572040	7577200	as the wrong approach Klebold psychologist said that Dylan was a sociopath a manipulator
7577200	7582580	a young man absolutely set in his goals allowing him to talk would not have allowed anyone
7582580	7587100	to get into this criminals mind he would have charmed them just as he did his parents his
7587100	7596320	teachers and his psychologists oh my god Marilyn Manson then is on the warpath now he's been
7596320	7601600	charmed there's a whole nother thing I mean Marilyn Manson has basically made a career
7601600	7606300	off of attention-grabbing and it's the same thing many people have done in our culture
7606300	7613760	they've made millions off of grabbing attention Alice Cooper Madonna Gaga kiss right okay
7613760	7618760	lastly last comment Preston Evans says blame graduate studies for the shooting he was studying
7618760	7623880	neuroscience that would do that to anyone psyche in reality there is no current way
7623880	7628800	to stop ridicule of one small part of our society for one great event when all parties
7628800	7633800	have a part in it it's too hard to fix that just throw one to the wolves instead of of
7633800	7640840	all taking the slap on the cheek for your part in the grand planned all right I know
7640840	7647680	that's a tough topic guys but you know again on CNN and this happened on CNN within hours
7647680	7654640	there's that pundit on the TV it's video games this is what we have to put up with as a culture
7654640	7660400	so some different ideas from our listeners on how to stop it there you go our frugal
7660400	7666960	question of the week all right let's try to lighten the mood up let's get back into video
7666960	7672880	games talking about some less serious video games and so forth or in this case I guess
7672880	7679360	this is something a little serious going on on Xbox right Loki exactly they've been secretly
7679360	7685460	tightening their security and this started I guess with the spring update that we just
7685460	7691440	had the one that prepped for you know the fall update that kind of thing right now says
7691440	7698360	they are encouraging people to check their security information update their passwords
7698360	7704760	and of course you know the the update they said built on security enhancements for the
7704760	7711080	near future and so I guess they're working there might be something that they'll announce
7711080	7717420	for like the fall update or something like that my thing is though it I know I understand
7717420	7721940	that they're going to be secretly doing this stuff but why go such a secret route with
7721940	7727320	it unless you know maybe they're worried that they're if they said oh yeah we're updating
7727320	7732840	our security people ah so your security had issues that need to be addressed then you
7732840	7737840	just wouldn't admit to it but the same time when they do it secretly it kind of makes
7737840	7742240	me wonder they really did have issues that need to be addressed and they just didn't
7742240	7746760	want to cop to it so either way at least they're making it step in the right direction I guess
7746760	7751120	but they really say what security measures are being put in place that weren't in place
7751120	7756360	before and I can understand the secrecy behind me as critical as I've been of Microsoft on
7756360	7760040	this whole issue in the past I can understand why they don't want to give it all away because
7760040	7764160	they don't want to give the people that are hacking the accounts hints so I can understand
7764160	7768200	why they're being very vague about it and I'm strangely okay with that I'm glad they
7768200	7774320	have finally come out and said something finally and that they have said that they've taken
7774320	7780000	the measures to stop it and I I honestly think that hacked on xbox.com and their whole little
7780000	7785000	report about that they were working customer service I think that is directly to thank
7785000	7789160	for this finally coming out finally um and then here's some of the details of stuff they
7789160	7794080	do that we increase notifications to members whose accounts may be compromised to add proofs
7794080	7800240	update the passwords and if necessary or necessary uh contact xbox support this helps our team
7800240	7804440	lock down an account quickly investigate and restore the account to its rightful owner
7804440	7810600	uh we've taken legal action to pull down uh online posts of gamer tags usernames and passwords
7810600	7815560	gathered from malware phishing schemes to help protect our members our live um spring
7815560	7819680	update include me behind the scenes improvements to help us build on security enhancements
7819680	7824680	for the near future we are sending unique codes to sec um security phone numbers and
7824680	7830960	secondary email addresses provided by members to verify authorization for xbox.com purchases
7830960	7836400	um account change attempts uh not staying from members trusted device I can vouch for
7836400	7842600	that for a fact because we've had to recently um because you know how much of a pain in
7842600	7847560	the ass it is is to um stop their auto renew well we had some other co-workers I've created
7847560	7853080	accounts for my old pc but since you know um you know I've worked at the company that
7853080	7858280	I worked at uh my switch species and so they was asking me for a second verifiable thing
7858280	7861440	problem is though is you can put any phone number you want in there and they'll just
7861440	7865160	call you with the security thing so that doesn't really help you but I mean granted it will
7865160	7871480	give you a phone number that they can send that to cool or text it to that's the other
7871480	7875360	thing too so if like you know there's a lot of free texting programs out there that you
7875360	7881840	can get a disposable number for that so it's not it's an extra layer but it's not foolproof
7881840	7885960	have they finally programmed it in on the xbox where it asks you for your card security
7885960	7890040	code whenever you make a transaction because I know that's available on xbox.com no why
7890040	7895320	don't they do that that would have helped so in so many situations because the hackers
7895320	7899120	would not have all those card codes and only let a person do it like three times and then
7899120	7907380	it removes the card from file it would seem super easy that's the way to do it am I crazy
7907380	7912840	well they wouldn't be as convenient to purchase stuff and that's well too fucking bad because
7912840	7917680	it's the right thing to do well the right thing is not profitable and then of course
7917680	7922920	you know we're working on we're working to reduce market incentives for criminal activity
7922920	7927520	engaging in identity theft trading and stolen accounts and committing credit card fraud
7927520	7933880	are legal and violate our terms of use those involved in these activities blah blah blah
7933880	7939960	so they get banned and blah but here's the thing though is reduce market incentives last
7939960	7945440	I remember I believe Madden now started selling those cards too that FIFA was so popular for
7945440	7951440	you know those the ones that you can exchange for real money or something basically you
7951440	7959360	buy all these fun cards and sell the account so no you're not discouraging it in fact those
7959360	7965160	companies are encouraging it by adding more games to that process so I don't think that's
7965160	7977800	really going away but just change your passwords on a regular base all right moving on to another
7977800	7981960	new story here and this has to do with the Wii U we haven't talked a lot about tonight
7981960	7986000	but there's still some rumblings going on there's always new rumors every week and this
7986000	7991800	time it's about Borderlands 2 but Gearbox actually the co-founder Brian Martell came
7991800	7997640	out and said good things about the Wii U quote we really like the Wii U I think it's a really
7997640	8001180	cool platform I like what they're doing obviously with the touchscreen and it will be interesting
8001180	8005880	to see what Microsoft does with their approach to that idea it's one of those problems of
8005880	8011200	the Wii the only people who have ever made a lot of money on the Wii is Nintendo if Borderlands
8011200	8017160	2 was on the Wii U the thing I would most be excited about is inventory management it
8017160	8021440	would be amazing on that it would just be fantastic and I think the artwork would look
8021440	8024960	really good with the way they can deal with the resolution and textures I think it's a
8024960	8029560	really good console so a lot of people are jumping ahead and saying confirmed Borderlands
8029560	8034680	2 on Wii U well of course they want to port it to any system they can if it's easy to
8034680	8040200	port it over then cool but once again it's kind of running into that same issue with
8040200	8044760	what did DS do all the time oh well put the pause screen stuff the inventory stuff on
8044760	8049840	the bottom screen instead of you know having to be a separate screen so do I really want
8049840	8053520	to buy another system so that I don't have to pause my game to change my inventory I
8053520	8057040	don't fucking care I'll pause my game to change my inventory and not have to buy another system
8057040	8065920	for $300 but that's assuming you know you're a person who doesn't end up buying it for
8065920	8070720	some other reason I understand that but at the same time though you know all those inventory
8070720	8073920	things at the bottom screen you still have to look away from the screen to do all that
8073920	8080760	shit so I don't know oh well also in related news about the Wii U another Wii U game this
8080760	8086160	one's called Rise of the Guardians has been given a November release date November 23rd
8086160	8094360	for the 3DS DS 360 PlayStation 3 Wii and Wii U so this is another game being released in
8094360	8102560	November but I mean come on well it's game system to be out by November 23rd do I really
8102560	8109320	need to read yeah I'm gonna do it again November 18th it's coming out fucking November 18th
8109320	8114540	I don't know that for sure but it's coming out November 18th why because everything points
8114540	8120000	to November 18th as the day I can't wait for it to not be that day I'm gonna play that
8120000	8127920	clip on repeat I within seven days November 18th would you care to make a bet I have a
8127920	8137360	costume you don't have a costume that does not exist November 18th 249 to 349 price range
8137360	8141240	because of three different skews we already covered this on another show go back in the
8141240	8148040	archives and find it all right Alan what do you got for us in the silly and weird lawsuit
8148040	8153860	department there's the story that's come out company based out of out of Texas excuse me
8153860	8160320	I tech patent collector Unilock is the name of the company has filed suit against Mojang
8160320	8166220	Mojang as some people may realize or remember is a Marcus persons company he's the developer
8166220	8175840	and creator of Minecraft so this company Unilock is suing Mojang for and this is a typo in
8175840	8183260	the thing that was put out to Mojang like the notice they're being sued Minecraft with
8183260	8189260	a D so there's a typo in the claim that gets the name of the product wrong specifically
8189260	8197480	for the Android version of Minecraft the patent that it's been that they are accusing Mojang
8197480	8203720	of infringing is a system and method for preventing unauthorized access to electronic data isn't
8203720	8209080	that a password like I know I'm kind of ignorant about this this patent I haven't read the
8209080	8215320	whole thing because it's very dry but specifically the filing references claim 107 of the patent
8215320	8220400	which covers a computer code executable on an electronic device to prevent unauthorized
8220400	8226840	access to electronic data stored on the electronic device so I don't know if it's the certain
8226840	8231760	system or style that Minecraft is doing this on the Android but they're saying oh yeah
8231760	8236840	we did that and only we can do that so they're suing it and Notch has said unfortunately
8236840	8241600	for them they are suing us over a software patent if needed I will throw piles of money
8241600	8247040	making sure they don't get a cent software patents are plain evil innovation within software
8247040	8252840	is basically free and it's growing incredibly rapid patents only slow it down Unilock is
8252840	8257400	seeking damages compounded by both pre and post judgment interest as well as ongoing
8257400	8266140	royalties from a Mojang so like what the fuck yeah and it's not not Minecraft the PC platform
8266140	8280380	but specifically the Android one for whatever reason and not just saying lol at you alright
8280380	8284360	this does sound a little patent trollish to me right yeah it's just me because they got
8284360	8290320	the name of the yeah I got the name of the product wrong in the in the suit wow yeah
8290320	8298160	good luck with that guys moving on Loki people are really trying to give me the word that
8298160	8303560	tingle suit it's not gonna happen not gonna happen remember you lost your opportunity
8303560	8309280	should bought more copies of what was that again I don't remember the name and title
8309280	8318920	oh yeah I have judgment brown eye of judgment so let's talk a little bit about oh yeah because
8318920	8326680	you know it's been what a week so of course you know they were they've been doing updates
8326680	8331760	on the Kickstarter one of the updates that they did to kind of get people to trust them
8331760	8336600	a little more so that they let them know that one of the people on the production team is
8336600	8349880	actually the guy that helped launch the Amazon Kindle line movie Dolly I believe godly how
8349880	8355880	you pronounce his last name anyways he was in charge of the Kindle line you know he's
8355880	8362580	says you know he's basically his purpose there is to make sure that the system launches and
8362580	8368900	you know saying that you know my job is ensure that we meet the needs of gamers and developers
8368900	8375000	and you know saying that they're trying to get out the software development kit as quickly
8375000	8380860	as possible to perspective developers also that they're hiring engineers to join their
8380860	8387640	team as well some other announcements that they made regarding the oh yeah is that they're
8387640	8393280	going to have an exclusive game to it Robert Bulling's human element is going to have a
8393280	8398320	prequel on the system human element is going to be a zombie game that's going to be coming
8398320	8407960	out on consoles in 2015 that's a long time and he's going to have a prequel to be launching
8407960	8412960	on oh yeah first actually at the launch of the console and it's going to kind of follow
8412960	8420720	the the events that lead up to the actual human element game of course also you may
8420720	8427920	remember Robert Bulling from well his new studio Robo Robo Toki and he originally you
8427920	8436600	know was one developers for Call of Duty modern warfare so prequel and of course he also donated
8436600	8442040	ten thousand dollars to the project as well so they've got lots of you know their people
8442040	8446240	sign on there's actually a lot of indie developers that are kind of jumping on board as well
8446240	8451560	a lot of them actually have kick-started projects as well so at least there's gonna be some
8451560	8456720	games on there and they've been trying to answer questions and whatnot from the community
8456720	8463440	regarding why we've seen a controller and that kind of stuff so interest well now that
8463440	8468440	they have a game finally to talk about what do you think I think it sounds like a cool
8468440	8472520	game I don't know what kind of a game it is though but there's a lot of other like you
8472520	8477320	know people there in the Kickstarter you know world they're like that want to bring their
8477320	8486080	games to the console like one they're gonna be talking about pretty soon watch the very
8486080	8491320	soon is another shadow run game that they're thinking about bringing that to oh yeah as
8491320	8496080	well there's a lot of games are right now saying hey you know if we get this game out
8496080	8502920	we're gonna put it on you as well so they've got support it just I mean I think it's just
8502920	8507720	really early still in the development stage as far as you know the design I mean obviously
8507720	8515080	they haven't finalized a you know a controller yet but they're gonna have one it's just you
8515080	8522480	know they have a beta kit running or you know a prototype and that's it all right I'm gonna
8522480	8528200	move on with another story here but first we finally gave that code away instead of
8528200	8532960	doing it to just somebody random and unfortunately twice we hit people that weren't around I
8532960	8536600	finally put a call out in chat and I said look if you're gonna use this code and you
8536600	8542400	want the code send me a private message right now and I asked Alan to pick a random number
8542400	8549240	and the winner was Ospher won the code and yes he's going to use it so congrats thanks
8549240	8553760	again sorry that contest was a little bit of a mess but I thought I thought we do something
8553760	8558800	fun with the new website registration but oops I guess people were were checking in
8558800	8563920	and then leaving to get dinner so there you go at least we know it's gonna get some good
8563920	8570280	use because it was an opt-in thing that time all right let's move on to this I think this
8570280	8574920	is a little bit of a follow-up from last week because I remember we brought the first part
8574920	8580320	of this up because remember it was about that game on the iPhone that was heavily borrowing
8580320	8587640	quote-quote assets from torchlight and torchlight was pissed so they you know I guess they went
8587640	8591680	and they went on a Twitter rampage and all this stuff but here's the interesting thing
8591680	8600420	the company egls actually came out and made a statement I guess oh gosh where is this
8600420	8607600	here egls went to touch arcades and said we hardly agree with Travis Baldry from ruining
8607600	8615320	games who judged the egls wholesale stole most of the assets from torchlight egls is
8615320	8620080	entertainment game labs by the way who is the developer behind this only based on the
8620080	8627800	similarity between several small monsters the judgment is simply untenable yeah except
8627800	8633720	there's a little more to that egls employees say they are quote both crazy game fans and
8633720	8640600	a static movie lovers so the comparisons are an accident at best arm heroes said the last
8640600	8645880	time they checked was still available on itunes it's free to play with purchases well what
8645880	8651100	ended up happening a little later egls did come out and say all right we'll remove some
8651100	8655900	parts of the game so they talk about that they are going to make some small changes
8655900	8663280	to the game they want he but runic games really wants egls to admit that they just told me
8663280	8667320	well they did they actually stole even the audio from the game and really some unused
8667320	8673440	audio clips like a certain sort or something like that that they have in torchlight all
8673440	8677960	the audio files were named exactly the same as torchlight all of them like even you know
8677960	8681840	stuff that they didn't use he said I also downloaded the app you can unzip them and
8681840	8685880	look at any iphone app and there was a sound manifest that listed all the sound files that
8685880	8690160	was in the game and they were verbatim all of our sound files including our own misspellings
8690160	8701040	uh oh yeah so they stole them yikes now armed heroes online is now down I guess runic filed
8701040	8705840	a complaint and finally it got taken down but it took a little while that was on when
8705840	8713120	did it finally get pulled july 19th that was thursday when it finally got pulled and we
8713120	8720080	reported on that last week I wonder how many people uh grabbed that game black wolf in
8720080	8723720	our chat room says they're in china so there was nothing legal they could do yeah they
8723720	8728120	can't like they can't sue the company but they can fight them through apple that's what
8728120	8734600	they did apparently they can also reinforce stereotypes regarding china what that it's
8734600	8741680	thieves and gold farmers and all this remember mose and all this or what they copy they copy
8741680	8748320	and you know counterfeit stuff well and it's any it seems like any story I read nowadays
8748320	8752720	about a chinese company making a game it's oh okay would you counterfeit oh there it
8752720	8759600	is hey look we stole stuff from team fortress 2 this time oh hey shana linko in our chat
8759600	8764200	room says they also stole the warlock tier 10 gear for one of their classes from warcraft
8764200	8771440	world of warcraft so it appears they like to borrow from lots of different places hmm
8771440	8776160	but it's gone now and let's I wonder if apple actually like really hammered the ban hammer
8776160	8780080	on them because you know apple usually when shit like this happens apple will just say
8780080	8784920	you've lost your license done you're not getting to put publish anymore but most of them just
8784920	8788520	come back under another name you're not gonna publish anymore until you pay another hundred
8788520	8793360	dollars to buy a different license under a different name exactly all right every week
8793360	8798840	we invite your emails at mailbag orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer she usually dives
8798840	8803680	into the mailbag head first to read some of her favorite emails but in her absence she's
8803680	8808320	loaned the hazmat suit to alan who will dive into the email bag i need to state this we
8808320	8814200	received a lot of emails this week actually yeah there's a bunch um nine it's it's weird
8814200	8818320	because usually we're sitting here with one or two going send us more well you sent more
8818320	8822080	this week but here's what we're gonna do because we don't have enough time to read especially
8822080	8825240	after some of the other segments now we don't have enough time to read all the emails i'm
8825240	8830040	gonna have alan read the first half of the emails that came in we're gonna roll the second
8830040	8835780	half to next week okay uh it doesn't mean you can't email us still just send more emails
8835780	8840080	mailbag orange lounge radio.com but i mean like i even tried to go in and screen the
8840080	8844540	emails and like they're all valid they're all pretty good so we want to get to them
8844540	8852200	all just not all tonight first email is from robert m subject three questions this is robert
8852200	8857480	m and i just had three somewhat quick questions or rather two and an observation first have
8857480	8862440	you guys had the chance to check out spelunky yet i saw on a preview of the 360 version
8862440	8867360	that someone did a mac port so it's one of my steam shortcuts now reportedly steam may
8867360	8872140	be getting a version of the game with the 360s graphics and extra modes secondly if
8872140	8878600	you're too i haven't checked it out sorry blame the rest of the steam sale on that one
8878600	8884440	yeah secondly if you're too busy with minecraft based on what you know do you see updates
8884440	8890440	for the ios version falling by the wayside uh with the android version because i don't
8890440	8895080	really follow the minecraft forums enough to i haven't played the ios version at all
8895080	8899360	it's kind of like for ios game it's kind of expensive which is ridiculous because i have
8899360	8903080	like 19 credit on my itunes account right now thanks to gift cards but i don't know
8903080	8907860	i just i've kind of avoided it for some inexplicable reason but you have it don't you matt have
8907860	8916840	what minecraft on ios uh i have it on android oh you have it on android i would think that
8916840	8922760	i mean minecraft on pc is so popular because it's pretty it's like limitless right the
8922760	8927200	world just goes on forever right i don't think you can do that on the phone and i think the
8927200	8930960	the 360 has really taken off so maybe the phone's really limited what they've gotten
8930960	8935320	there's a lot of like there's object types that aren't there and there's a lot of things
8935320	8941720	that you have unlimited supplies of because they saw voice yeah technically the 360 version
8941720	8944780	is limited too but there was a story that came out this week they've sold 3 million
8944780	8950040	copies of that it's one of the biggest xbox live arcade titles ever crazy finally going
8950040	8954360	back to the email finally not a question i came across a banner ad for one of those free
8954360	8960360	to play empire building games with the mandatory woman in the image being anna williams as
8960360	8965740	in literally the tekken 6 character art weird i'm almost certain amco has nothing to do
8965740	8972760	with this ftp keep up it's probably from china i'm just saying i'm just gonna refer you
8972760	8977660	to that story we just read i'm just gonna say just just rewind the podcast 10 minutes
8977660	8981360	and go back to that last story and that's probably what's going on unless it's an amco
8981360	8985740	game but i kind of doubt that anna williams by the way was an amazing tekken character
8985740	8991580	just saying okay this one i'm not going to read because i think that's an admin question
8991580	8999260	for you oh yeah yeah don't read that one sorry that is one we can screen out okay um next
8999260	9004740	email from jeffrey help is there a support group to help me stop buying all of the games
9004740	9009940	in the summer steam sale maybe a transdermal patch to slowly meter out old video games
9009940	9016300	that i will probably never play well you came to the wrong place i've picked up a couple
9016300	9021700	indie bundles the thq pack and a few other odds and ends i most likely won't touch half
9021700	9027620	of the games included i'm just interjecting my own note here for all of the games that
9027620	9031680	i bought this weekend or on this week under the sale i don't have the hard drive space
9031680	9036380	to install like half of them at once so yeah it's very easy to have hundreds of gigs of
9036380	9042100	games in your library um i most likely won't touch half the games included now i see what
9042100	9047980	happens to old people when they watch qvc that shit is no joke my mother is addicted
9047980	9051820	to qvc and she'll never admit it and she'll hate me for telling you very prescient and
9051820	9058940	terrifying observation and it is 100 correct oh my god steam is qvc without the host but
9058940	9063740	at least qvc has like marie osmond and shit true story you guys i think i've mentioned
9063740	9069580	this on the show before for the new listeners true story you guys like my mother owns the
9069580	9077900	complete richard simmons doll collection from qvc my mother they're all old lady dolls too

9103180	9108260	love tell me to stop uh i could also accept encouragement but that would be detrimental

9197180	9202300	guy takes a lot of shit and he really is just trying to be a good person you know what i
9202300	9209460	mean he's in his 60s now i know i hope i have that much energy when i'm 60 i know travis
9209460	9212900	likes to make fun of me and all that stuff and you know compare me to him but i could
9212900	9217140	only hope to be that energetic it's only gonna come out like sometime later and he's been
9217140	9222220	on some sort of drug or something like that like he's just the only drug that man is on
9222220	9231060	his penis okay he's on wow i'm just saying he's got a healthy dose of fabulous and there's
9231060	9240060	absolutely nothing wrong with that clearly hey right alan i'm just saying just saying

9251180	9255520	over and over on your show if you want i don't care make fun of me we need more people like
9255520	9259180	richard simmons in the world really i mean there is there's nothing wrong with richard
9259180	9263220	simmons richard simmons is the antithesis of the evil we were talking about earlier
9263220	9271340	right what's what is wrong with richard simmons nothing i hope nothing like what you were
9271340	9274460	talking about ever does come out because that would greatly disappoint me but i think he's
9274460	9279380	just a good person he's just trying to get old people not to die what's wrong with that
9279380	9288800	we don't want grandma to die hi olr sorry tonic vision i got a chance yesterday to go
9288800	9293840	check out the wii u in person they are doing a tensity tour and inviting club nintendo
9293840	9298380	members and wanted to share my impressions with you to preface i would just like to say
9298380	9302780	that i don't consider myself to really be a fanboy of any particular system and don't
9302780	9307160	really have a vested interest in one over another because to me they all have various
9307160	9312140	strengths and weaknesses i own basically every current system including the 3ds and the vita
9312140	9317880	and i'm generally excited enough by next generation hardware to be a consistent early adopter
9317880	9322300	with that said i really cannot find any way to get excited about the wii u even after
9322300	9327860	hands-on play with each and every launch title why is this for me it is because of the following
9327860	9332780	three reasons so this guy got an exclusive invite to some like top secret come play the
9332780	9336580	wii u in an unmarked building type of thing speaking of which i may actually have an impression
9336580	9344060	of the wii u after this week oh our ubisoft guy may be bringing a wii u to our game conference
9344060	9348860	saying i think it's probably for just dance four but um is there a rabbids game on wii
9348860	9354860	u i'm sure there is may or may not he's trying to get a wii u dev kit out but we'll see hmm
9354860	9360500	all right sorry item one the name sucks plain and simple why is this a big deal it's a big
9360500	9364980	deal because it's indicative of the fact that nintendo has become a little too comfortable
9364980	9369260	this is still a we folks yes it has a new controller and yes the graphics are prettier
9369260	9373620	but it is still a we at the end of the day what is my motivation for investing in a new
9373620	9378340	console when it's still in large part the old console this may make sense when you are
9378340	9382220	buying a new smartphone and want those cool new features but you're going to be getting
9382220	9386580	a new one in a year anyway this console is going to be in your living room for at least
9386580	9395540	five years so why is essentially uh so why is essentially we the sequel two well you
9395540	9403300	bought on super nintendo you take a playstation 3 and that's okay sequel sequels to consoles
9403300	9407860	are fine there's nothing more buttons okay that was oh well fuck me i guess my whole
9407860	9414200	point's invalid thank you loki i've seen the light well i i think he's saying that aside
9414200	9419620	from the the graphics hardware i mean the nintendo to the super nintendo was a huge
9419620	9427820	step in audio visual mode 7 about your shit up all right all right rob rob yes if there's
9427820	9435180	games on the like okay the jump from the no nes sns so you have zelda and mario brothers
9435180	9439660	and then you had super mario world and you know zelda 3 links to the past which are two
9439660	9444460	like of the best games ever exactly exactly yeah those were amazing fucking games and
9444460	9449700	look at how much better they are than the pre you know the previous system are we seeing
9449700	9453300	that with the wii u that's the thing it's like we have a new mario game that's exactly
9453300	9456900	like the fucking mario game that's already on the wii that's my thing if they came out
9456900	9461340	with a game that's like holy fucking shit that's goddamn amazing it's so much better
9461340	9464860	than the previous mario game where oh my god look at the zelda game it's fucking amazing
9464860	9469540	it's so much better than the one louis then maybe it'd be a different story but it's not
9469540	9476660	they are the same fucking games slightly prettier but basically the same it is hard to argue
9476660	9481120	with that the only thing i could say is that the zelda game wasn't a launch title but granted
9481120	9489700	the mario game was um maybe the best is yet to come i hope we'll see item two mario mario
9489700	9495540	mario enough we get it mario sells like crazy everyone loves mario we get it we expect a
9495540	9499900	new mario title with the launch of a new nintendo system absolutely what we don't expect or
9499900	9504780	deserve is a lazy reskin of a game that came out three years ago this is not enough to
9504780	9508700	sell your system nintendo at least not to me it's like eating pizza for dinner does
9508700	9513100	it taste good absolutely do i want to eat it every day for the next 10 years hell no
9513100	9517940	so don't ask me to i would i was just telling alan last night we haven't ordered pizza in
9517940	9521500	a long time and he's like oh you want to go to papa murphy's get a take and bake i'm like
9521500	9528140	no i want no i can sausage that's right we are going like we're gonna call straw hat
9528140	9532500	and we're gonna get it delivered in a box can you put a christmas ham just right on
9532500	9537160	the pizza when i worked at it when i worked at a pizza place i never got sick of pizza
9537160	9543220	i could eat pizza every goddamn day and and i would be happy eating pizza every day i
9543220	9548540	understand the point item three the technology isn't new i have played games on a touch screen
9548540	9552340	and i've played games with motion control putting them together is not innovative and
9552340	9556460	really doesn't bring anything terribly exciting to the masses playing through each and every
9556460	9561180	launch title i can say for a fact that not one of these really do something unexpected
9561180	9565460	with the marriage of these two technologies perhaps a year or so after launch there will
9565460	9569340	be a handful of third-party titles that will push the envelope and do something daring
9569340	9575320	sadly nintendo certainly won't be leading by example for all of these excuse me for
9575320	9579140	all of these reasons i really find myself at a loss when attempting to justify this
9579140	9584860	purchase at launch or maybe at all sorry for the rant but that was the feeling i was left
9584860	9590500	with after two hours with the wii u and this i mean this guy is an uber nintendo fan because
9590500	9595220	you had to be to get in the click to go see the system right yeah but he said that he
9595220	9599820	doesn't he doesn't really stand for any console enthusiast enough well then he's kind of like
9599820	9606820	any of us i mean i mean i like nintendo but i like sony and microsoft too you know some
9606820	9611640	days it just depends who's pissing me off this week on a separate note i wanted to share
9611640	9615620	with you another preview of some art that will be showcased at the upcoming video game

9670020	9676380	those emails roll them over yep uh this is from nasty canasta evening olr crew among
9676380	9681020	all the discussion about theaters pricing on your show bobby blackwolf sand around the
9681020	9686780	web i thought it was interesting that nobody considered to bring up the square enix tax
9686780	9691140	there have been instances where rpgs and related titles published by square enix especially
9691140	9696980	rereleases have a price that is artificially raised above the norm take squenix's ps1 classics
9696980	9702840	catalog for example whereas most games are priced at 5.99 chrono cross chrono trigger
9702840	9708220	all final fantasies and xenogears are worth nine are worth 9.99 to purchase oddly front
9708220	9714780	know why that is you know why that is because you'll pay it plain and simple plane is i
9714780	9718140	mean i there there's really no other way to any any square fan is going to be this is
9718140	9721660	my own commentary any square fan is going to be cuckoo bananas about those games and
9721660	9726140	i mean they're to be fair they're legendary larger games too because i know xeno gears
9726140	9731740	was two discs yeah fantasy seven was three discs and file hasi eight was also three and
9731740	9736940	nine and chrono cross was two yeah so i mean yeah but i mean i don't know it's but yes
9736940	9741260	i understand this day and age that's kind of a weak argument oddly front mission three
9741260	9745580	and vagrant story do not have inflated prices despite both having rpg elements and those
9745580	9750940	were more sleeper hits too or cult hits that is true for them um and those were also one
9750940	9755760	disc yeah i'm sure the tax also applies to titles available from nintendo's virtual console
9755760	9762520	service at least in japan nasty canasta i love that name by the way and uh wasn't when
9762520	9767660	secret of mana was ported to ios and put on the apple store wasn't it like really expensive
9767660	9771860	like it's four or five bucks which was outrageous for what it was just a port of the SNES i
9771860	9777420	want to say those games on nintendo and super nintendo virtual console were like 100 microsoft
9777420	9785260	points more or excuse me wow 100 nintendo points more i'm losing it tonight sorry i
9785260	9789300	was distracted because look who came to say hello look who never comes out in the studio
9789300	9793940	to say hello and look who's here it's maruko kitty kitty kitty do you have a comment maruko
9793940	9802200	are you brown he's sniffing the microphone so how is your cat by the way um sanrio is
9802200	9809180	doing much better she just needed a day to um have it basically she gets constipated
9809180	9814060	and when she has a really bad hairball and she's plugged up it'll tweak this nerve in
9814060	9818820	her stomach and it completely like knocks her out for a day where she just she can't
9818820	9823460	eat she's she gets dizzy if she walks she'll stumble and fall down she just needed a day
9823460	9830260	to get better so kitty can't poop but she can poop now sorry for the tmi uh but yeah
9830260	9834500	that it's really scary to see your cat like completely out of it you don't know what's
9834500	9839020	wrong well and a really good friend of ours had to put down their cat this week and i
9839020	9843020	know that's like really difficult and it was it was a long time trying to get him better
9843020	9847800	and figure out what was wrong with him so they finally had to it's yeah it's tough we
9847800	9851620	get really attached to our pets yeah so i love my kitty and i'm glad that she's better
9851620	9855080	but i need to make sure that doesn't happen again because i don't like seeing her like
9855080	9861180	that um yeah that's it for emails all right let's get to the fus of the week it's the
9861180	9865460	part of the show where we rent why because we can it's our show
9865460	9889780	uh f you to people that change lanes without signaling there's a lot of you out there i
9889780	9895580	don't know why people do that it's really annoying um also f you to the steam sale for
9895580	9901300	i guess i should blame myself but i'm blaming the steam sale uh for having me spend way
9901300	9907860	more money than i i wanted to on this new sale and uh buying games that i i will probably
9907860	9916540	play but just right away and just adds more games to the list and then um yeah that's
9916540	9925500	it uh alan you wanna go yeah on friday night my i have this gorgeous 25-inch hilt packard
9925500	9932340	uh monitor for my pc the picture on it's amazing and on friday night it started to flicker
9932340	9938380	like there was maybe some emf interference from like a nearby appliance or maybe the
9938380	9942340	backlight of the lcd was starting to go out which was terrifying because i don't want
9942340	9948860	to buy a new monitor right now so that sucked but i replaced the i took it off hdmi cable
9948860	9955220	and i plugged it into my video card with a dvi cable and now it's fine so the hdmi cable
9955220	9960780	went bad so fu to shitty eight dollar amazon hdmi cables that make you think your monitor
9960780	9964740	is dead well you should have got a sixty dollar monster cable they're all the same just buy
9964740	9969100	the cheapest possible cable yeah it was a belkin on amazon it lasted two years but i
9969100	9975740	guess the hdmi cable went bad so f you to heart attacks that yeah over technology people
9975740	9980980	wholesale.com they're damn cheap and it's one day shipping to us that's where i get
9980980	9988540	cables when i get happy did they pay you for that ad no next time they should but they're
9988540	9992180	so cal or actually no they're not so cal they're i don't know somewhere in the bay area or
9992180	9997660	something and so it's only my day not bad um i don't really have a lot of angst things
9997660	10003740	are going pretty good i i have a lot going on so fu to being really busy and i'm kind
10003740	10007260	of obligated to something over the next couple months is really gonna really cut into my
10007260	10011700	weekends which really stinks because i really need to like get back to san francisco and
10011700	10017220	see like grandpa warcraft and some other people over there and so on and fu to the fact that
10017220	10022260	the annual showing of showgirls which we must go to is the same day as another theater thing
10022260	10028460	i have here so i've got to make sure i can go because i love movie showgirls it's so
10028460	10040380	bad it's good you don't know shit all right uh let's move on loki one more news story
10040380	10044540	for us then i've got something and then that's the part where we get to taking your calls
10044540	10050940	at 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge radio but after two more stories here
10050940	10058780	so you can't go to both of those events because there are different places okay the same sorry
10058780	10064380	i've seen that's good i'm happy you made a showgirls showgirls one too many times and
10064380	10067900	it was only because i want to see the boobies that's that's really the only reason to watch
10067900	10075700	showgirls more than one time anyway so just saying um so let's talk a little bit about
10075700	10080060	kickstarter because why not we we always talk about kickstarter because it's in the news
10080060	10085140	all the time so a couple new games shadow run online i'm kind of excited about that
10085140	10090180	because shadow runs pretty awesome um but they're starting a kickstarter they're looking
10090180	10096020	to raise half a million dollars by august 14th so you can go check them out at kickstarter
10096020	10104700	um i'd i'd be interested in seeing a shadow run game um that's online i've already backed
10104700	10110440	the other one uh defense grid 2 if you're a fan of the tar defense games obviously you're
10110440	10115740	probably familiar with defense grid um they're trying to get some funding for kickstarter
10115740	10120420	or from kickstarter as well they kind of went the whole penny arcade route where you know
10120420	10126400	they put the goal down as 250 000 but really they need 1 million dollars to fully fund
10126400	10131300	the sequel otherwise you only get you know if they reach their goal of you know quarter
10131300	10137860	million dollars you get an expansion then if a half a million you get a remastered version
10137860	10143140	in the you know of the first game in the second game's engine and at you know three quarters
10143140	10148180	of a million you get you know level editor and then 1 million you get a sequel it's kind
10148180	10153860	of lame but that's how they're doing it and then last but not least if you're looking
10153860	10161100	for a alternative to kickstarter uh the website games planet has launched a new service called
10161100	10168460	games planet lab it's basically a crowd uh funding service it's in the uk um which is
10168460	10173140	kind of cool because it's not us only because kickstarter is us only um so you have to have
10173140	10178580	you know a way to you know pay via amazon on that but it's based in europe and they
10178580	10184020	will have uh projects from around the world and uh already they've got a couple games
10184020	10192980	on um the service that you can fund one's magrunner it's a you know title from 3am studios
10192980	10200420	and uh it's like a first person puzzler game and then they've also got uh day one which
10200420	10208100	is like an adult themed point and click adventure game like leisure suit larry uh they say it's
10208100	10215340	uh heavily influenced by uh the devil's dictionary i don't know i've never never heard of that
10215340	10221660	so um can't really say i believe the difference so with this uh service as opposed to kickstart
10221660	10227020	because i think one of the reasons uh people are kind of like i don't know about you know
10227020	10232260	crowdfunding stuff you know how we know we're actually a game i think they have um like
10232260	10238460	a process that they actually kind of review these games before they you know allow them
10238460	10242740	to be on the service also it's only going to be games on this service since you know
10242740	10252040	it is game planet labs um so that's kind of neat i guess if they have that um so cool
10252040	10259420	and so that's the alternative if you want to check it out it's i believe at lab.gamesplanet.com
10259420	10268020	want to say yeah lab.gamesplanet.com all right well uh since you just did a bunch of kickstarter-esque
10268020	10273020	stuff here um this one is kind of another kickstarter inspired thing but like it or
10273020	10278020	not kickstarter is now kind of a part of pop culture right now and that's probably one
10278020	10284180	of those things that we'll look back on in 10 years and on the next vh1 i love the 2010
10284180	10289220	decade special you'll have you know someone there talking about how everybody was in the
10289220	10293700	kickstarter and the other stuff inspired and one of the things that kickstarter has inspired
10293700	10300260	from namco bandai is nino starter and it has to do with the upcoming game nino kuni wrath
10300260	10305020	of the white witch wizards edition we have talked about this collector's edition before
10305020	10308500	on the show and we talked about how it's going to come with the game and a 300 page book
10308500	10314500	a little doll and some dlc will all be included in this well now they're expanding this for
10314500	10320900	the us based on the number of pre-orders so it doesn't say though what they will keep
10320900	10325040	adding to it when they hit different levels but i'm going to the page right now which
10325040	10331600	you can get at nino starter.com they don't say exactly what you will unlock but apparently
10331600	10334660	if you hit these different pre-order goals they're going to add stuff to the collector's
10334660	10341420	edition which is kind of cool oh here it is the first one the first item is a set of five
10341420	10348740	nino kuni prince so little crappy little postcards basically you know if that's you know but
10348740	10354580	that's cool i like that they're adding more stuff based on the number of pre-orders that's
10354580	10359260	i kind of like that i gotta admit i mean it's so what if it's nothing that exciting it's
10359260	10363680	still it's exciting to people that are really into this series i'd be all over this shit
10363680	10369100	if warcraft did this you know what i mean so that's a cute a cute little thing that
10369100	10373900	kickstarters inspired yes yeah all right i think it'd be better if it was like the regular
10373900	10379860	game and you know the more people that pre-order the game like more free shit like they upgrade
10379860	10383980	it for free like do a special edition or something like that and have crap that they throw in
10383980	10387740	there yeah that'd be a little bit better because collector's editions that's really a niche
10387740	10393340	niche niche audience you're you're not going to niche game with it now you know collector's
10393340	10397020	edition that's going to be even more niche than that it's 99 dollars too if you want
10397020	10400900	that collector's edition fuck that well see here's the thing i believe it or not i'm tempted
10400900	10405420	because i really do love you know the studio ghibli stuff and and the game looks good but
10405420	10410020	i just don't like i feel really weird taking that leap of faith when i don't really know
10410020	10414340	if the game's good or not i guess i could go a little japanese pretty good i know but
10414340	10418340	just because it looks pretty good come on what have we learned sometimes games that
10418340	10425100	look good don't really end up being very good or lasting a long time so i don't know but
10425100	10432820	i do think that doll is really cute though and the dlc might as well all right anyhow
10432820	10438140	uh we'll see we'll see if i get on board or not apparently uh you have until august 31st
10438140	10442720	to do this and they even have the little countdown clock there on nino starter.com it says right
10442720	10449020	now 2683 fans does that mean that many people are pre-ordered i'm assuming i don't know
10449020	10454500	maybe but uh little trailers available there and everything it's a cute little idea all
10454500	10458460	right we're going to open up the skype line at 1877 game olr or our username on skype
10458460	10461540	is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked
10461540	10467420	about tonight or maybe there's a story you think we've missed the skype line is now open
10467420	10470340	we'll get to last minute stories in a minute but i also want to read some of the tweets
10470340	10475340	that have come in at twitter.com slash olr and i'm going to start off tonight with a
10475340	10480900	tweet from dave falcon tweets us and says a few days ago i picked up duke nukem forever
10480900	10491380	at game stop for $4.99 yeah wow my how the mighty have fallen and fallen quick would
10491380	10499980	you buy it for $4.99 no i'd be curious i got well maybe it was gearbox made borderlands
10499980	10505660	dude i understand that and it's really sad what they had to work with uh for duke nukem
10505660	10508980	uh that's i mean that was kind of one of the things too it's like they lost a lot of credit
10508980	10512500	with that but borderlands 2 looks really awesome so all right let me go to the phones because
10512500	10516260	we are getting a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is excellent
10516260	10521740	hey x-link buddy what's up nothing really too much hey loki i'm also hyped for borderlands
10521740	10526580	2 i'm so happy that ashley is actually going to have a role inside of it playing as tiny
10526580	10531700	tina which is absolutely great because i love watching uh hey ash what you're playing so
10531700	10536860	i i thought she was great doing those so it's going to be kind of intriguing to see uh how
10536860	10542460	all that works out after after they uh bring everything to uh to it it's good to know too
10542460	10545740	that they actually have the game already done so hopefully they'll patch up any kind of
10545740	10550180	bugs or anything within that game so this hype train has me very interested with i'm
10550180	10554660	a big big fan of the first one i have the first one with all the dlc and actually i
10554660	10558620	would like to team up with some people go through the the arena part and get the rest
10558620	10562920	of the humans i did the the first arena by myself but the other ones are just brutal
10562920	10567780	after that so even with all my weapons i have so i swear i will try and play the game soon
10567780	10572700	i had to remove it from my hard drive because i needed the disk space but um it'll be back
10572700	10578500	uh really a couple things real quick chaos rings from uh square enix is 12.99 actually
10578500	10583260	on the uh is store right on the is store and then the sequel which came out not too long
10583260	10590500	ago was actually 17.99 so those are really expensive compared to xeno gears and the rest
10590500	10594700	of those for 9.99 i'd rather get those anyways at least that way you know i would have a
10594700	10600820	copy i could always play um compared um you know because you know you know stuff happens
10600820	10604820	you know this can break you know get scratched really easily um you know they're they're
10604820	10609020	very hard those are games also they were very hard to come by too you look on ebay you're
10609020	10613680	trying to find them they were going up to 50 70 80 a pop for some of those games so
10613680	10619340	um just to say oh well you know they're trying to you know gouge the price you know 10 bucks
10619340	10624460	it's a very simple price i'd rather pay 10 bucks than 50 or 60 you know wow yeah the
10624460	10628260	same thing it was the same thing with the seam sales you know i'm looking i bought uh
10628260	10633660	the dudgeon seed collection for seven dollars and 49 cents that was like 75 off i bought
10633660	10639020	a brink for five bucks i know that's a crappy game but i like these little person shooters
10639020	10642460	from time and time after having a rough day of work coming home and shooting something
10642460	10646620	it's really great to have some of this stuff and then of course i bought for my girlfriend
10646620	10653620	uh the secret of the magic crystal for a dollar 25 so i mean you can't really beat those prices
10653620	10658020	for the for the sale so i'm looking at my ipad right now at the store and yeah i mean
10658020	10663860	square really does charge a premium for some of their games final fantasy tactics 17.99
10663860	10669740	yeah chaos rings 2 just like you said 19.99 on the ipad yeah i i'll pass on that you can
10669740	10674740	get imaginary range for free yeah i have my three i have my 3ds that can you know play
10674740	10678620	those games just some of those games just fine and you know i'd rather do it or something
10678620	10684180	like that then you know i didn't worry about paying you know 18 19 bucks on a on an app
10684180	10687900	that when i'm middle doing something like you like you said basically for mass effect
10687900	10695300	3 is going to crash upon me you know i i pass on that so um oh it's absolutely 100 you know
10695300	10700220	bulletproof it's not going to crash or anything maybe but even then that's that's a considerable
10700220	10706820	amount of money that's a big chunk so um especially since i have most of those games anyways and
10706820	10711180	it is everyone get the same thing you know i'm not i really don't feel like pay 17 18
10711180	10717500	bucks for it again i'm sorry so um and also about these shootings and you know they always
10717500	10720940	you know every time when some of this happens you know they're you know always blaming the
10720940	10727100	media some somehow whether it be video games uh movies you know uh music you know it's
10727100	10730900	kind of weird they never mentioned books like what kind of books was a person reading what
10730900	10735780	kind of reading was the person doing to get to maybe even this frame of mind oh some books
10735780	10739780	are just as dangerous just as anything else some people still there's no moving objects
10739780	10744220	or anything within books excellent some people still blame books i mean you know granted
10744220	10748720	i'm getting a little historical here but fahrenheit 451 was a book ironically that was kind of
10748720	10752740	all about that and we still have this day and age you know people that try to ban books

11027920	11033440	by amnesia and alan wake like alan wake won because i heard it's kind of silent hilly
11033440	11039300	and so i might like that and amnesia actually did i watched a group play through it and
11039300	11043020	i played like a little part of it myself but like there are some bits and pieces i missed
11043020	11047940	so i should really get the full game but i don't know that game made me terrified at
11047940	11051540	some points like there's actually a video of me playing through it at one point and
11051540	11056780	i'm just like screaming when i do something blatantly obvious that hurts me and i don't
11056780	11059780	know it's a great game wait you're saying there's this video like it's out there on
11059780	11068260	youtube yes oh you need to give me the link uh okay here it's a video of like a bunch
11068260	11072380	of people like in my group down at college we all get together and we play games late
11072380	11078260	at night and um that was one of them and it just has all the screen and you you film your
11078260	11083580	antics and put them up on youtube for your adoring public it wasn't me okay it was the
11083580	11086980	guy who was in our group he brings in his desktop and i even know this but he has like
11086980	11091900	a microphone sitting behind the desk that we're playing at and he's just recording everything
11091900	11099660	and so he takes the screen and then he like slows it down and it's pretty hilarious all
11099660	11102580	right well while you're looking for that link for me is there anything else you want to
11102580	11110780	call in to discuss tonight um nothing else other than the fact that i might regret getting
11110780	11115340	my friend mass effect because he gets it gets really into it then he'll eventually get the
11115340	11119220	mass act 3 and then i'll be like oh i want to play with you online i guess i have to

11206300	11210820	podcast don't even know that we played f-zero music during the break i don't care they're
11210820	11217660	not special um they didn't get to hear f-zero music use an opinion of shane or shanes what
11217660	11223700	i'm just saying um anyway making sure the podcast listeners know you're a jerk there
11223700	11229380	you know that um and now i have to go find my copy of f-zero because i may need to play

11299060	11303100	gonna have to wait for that to load it's buffering meanwhile we'll take one more call hi you're
11303100	11307820	on orange lawn's radio who's this what up guys it's zinek or the okc how you guys doing
11307820	11313260	hey i'm good how you doing zinek or hey no staying employed that's that in this economy
11313260	11319160	that's a hard thing to do yeah yeah actually i've been playing a hell of a lot of the streets
11319160	11326500	of rage v5 remake that got pushed out oh yeah did sega succeed in getting that pulled it
11326500	11330940	already escaped to the internet there's no stopping it that's right they may kill their
11330940	11337080	own personal link but it's out in the wilds now that's very true so uh what made you decide
11337080	11342340	to play the play this remake you just love streets of rage dude they they did rearrangement
11342340	11348460	of usazuki's music what what version do you need you thought f0's music was good you put
11348460	11352060	that stuff on with real instruments and everything behind it it's amazing you want to put it
11352060	11357260	up in the club and just play all night so the soundtrack alone is worth checking it
11357260	11361340	out for that's cool yeah i ripped the whole thing it's already on my phone so i can listen
11361340	11367060	to it in my car when i'm driving awesome awesome yeah but it's actually a pretty faithful remake
11367060	11371620	so it you know it's all pixelated and everything even if you make it full screen so it's almost
11371620	11375980	like playing on a on maim or something else like that but it's all custom so it did quite
11375980	11382340	a good job with it in fact that it's almost i i understand why sega might want to squash
11382340	11385980	it because it's almost a better version what they've been putting out for their games it's
11385980	11390500	better than what they do to sonic in some ways exactly probably yeah i could see that
11390500	11396700	i could see that so uh what else is on your mind this week uh that's pretty much it i
11396700	11400440	mean yeah the steam's taking care of everything but they still can't lure me to skyrim until
11400440	11404140	they get a game of the year version so i can get all the dlc at once for one price thanks
11404140	11410180	very much there is no dlc on pc yet i believe uh the vampire dlc comes out when it's got
11410180	11415140	to be really soon right yeah but they went sooner or later it will but i did pick up
11415140	11421340	the uh the uh arkham city dlc for three bucks so i played my two hours of that and was like
11421340	11427140	ah okay neat oh yeah that's right that just uh that was the big thing that was on sale
11427140	11431420	during the week too i forgot about that yeah almost all the dlc has their own little mini
11431420	11434660	sales you just got to go into the game to see them if they're not currently running

11490100	11499260	had to apologize because a programmer hid the phrase big boobs in company software microsoft
11499260	11504700	apologized for the joke because it was an offensive string the computer did fix or did
11504700	11509660	fix the issue with a patch the offending code is within computer code that connects the
11509660	11515180	linux kernel to a microsoft virtualization product now apparently there's a string in
11515180	11521140	the hexadecimal computer language that says in hexadecimal big boobs if you can figure
11521140	11525940	out how to read it the code was spotted by programmers and caused controversy within
11525940	11530300	the community because of course they want to distance themselves from being just a all
11530300	11536780	male pig-headed club but i don't know i think big big boobs is harmless that's funny i'm
11536780	11543620	sorry big boobs is funny even even women like boobs right yes if jamie were here she would
