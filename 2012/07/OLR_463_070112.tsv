7000	13000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, July 1st, 2012, a full-time anime channel is console-bound,
19000	26000	a classic edutainment title is set to become a movie, and one gaming company turns 40 years old.
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello, my friends out there on the Internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	39000	where every gamer has a voice here at Orange Lounge Radio.
39000	46000	We are live as we are every Sunday night at VOG Network, or the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGNetwork.com.
46000	52000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
52000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming,
57000	61000	and have some LOLs, and start 10 more years of the fun with my co-host.
61000	64000	Say hello first off to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
64000	66000	Loki has curly fries.
66000	69000	I know, he always brings such yummy food and then waves it in front of us.
69000	71000	I think that he should give me one.
71000	73000	May I please have a curly fry?
73000	75000	Techmaster Loki here tonight, what do you say?
75000	77000	Aww, he's handing one over.
77000	80000	They gave me small and a medium because they were out of large boxes.
80000	84000	So is that like Jack in the Box math? Small plus medium equals large?
84000	86000	Oh my god, Grease.
86000	88000	Grease is truly the word.
88000	92000	Joining us tonight, we have a special guest, somebody who hasn't been on the show in a while,
92000	95000	but he's no stranger to OLR, but maybe some of you haven't heard him before.
95000	97000	Say hello to Alan!
97000	98000	Hello.
98000	99000	How are you doing?
99000	100000	I'm doing great.
100000	103000	Awesome. Now you're on the wonky mic tonight, I might have to have you switch out,
103000	106000	because I've already heard some little crackle-shreckle.
106000	111000	So yeah, chat, if I sound like crap, let us know. Don't let me go through the whole show like this.
111000	113000	Or pretend he's a robot.
113000	115000	There you go. How are you doing?
115000	116000	I'm good.
116000	119000	What's new with you since you were on the show last? I don't even remember when you were actually on the show.
119000	122000	Well, you've made cameo appearances, like one or two lines.
122000	126000	I'll be in the office playing a game and then I will run out into the living room and just shout something
126000	129000	that's relevant to the show when I'm not even on the show.
129000	131000	Does this microphone work?
131000	133000	It's not even plugged in. It's muted.
133000	135000	I understand that, but would it work if you were plugged in?
135000	139000	Yeah, in fact, the hissing is still happening, so I'm going to ask Alan to switch out the mic he's using
139000	142000	and pick up that other one instead. Let me actually mute that.
142000	143000	Live radio.
143000	145000	The choice of live radio at vognetwork.com.
145000	146000	Okay, try again.
146000	147000	Okay.
147000	150000	All right, you're just going to be a little quiet, so be sure you talk good and loud.
150000	153000	I'll turn up your gain a little bit and I'll hopefully help.
153000	155000	Did you say you were going to turn up the gay a little bit?
155000	156000	No, the game.
156000	158000	Hey.
158000	162000	Hey, girl. Welcome to Orange Town Radio. What do?
162000	167000	Stop. So I got a job in early May that has me working nights.
167000	172000	I work in a call center because it's an election year doing political surveys,
172000	176000	and usually when OLR is taping for the last month and a half, I've been at work.
176000	180000	I get home at like 10 o'clock or like 930 when the show's wrapping up.
180000	186000	Yeah, I got a little promotion, so I'm going to have later hours,
186000	188000	but hopefully that doesn't start until next week.
188000	190000	So here I am, taking advantage.
190000	195000	So here you are taking advantage of the week off, I should say, that you have.
195000	196000	Yeah.
196000	200000	So welcome. All right, well, we are going to get in, of course, to all the news this week,
200000	203000	or lack thereof. Is it just me or was it really kind of a slow news week?
203000	208000	I mean, when people are reporting on Twitter, that's usually an indication it's a slow week.
208000	212000	I've been in a Normandy-shaped bubble all week, so I haven't cared.
212000	216000	Well, it sounds like we need to get to gaming weeks, but first, before we get to gaming weeks
216000	220000	and the obvious game that Dark Soccer has been playing, I always like to do kind of a kickoff topic,
220000	222000	and I've got to start with this one tonight.
222000	229000	And I want to talk about what it means, and those that have seen the FUGL Question of the Week,
229000	232000	which I'm going to read in Part B in a little bit, kind of know about this already,
232000	237000	but I wanted to talk a little bit about what it means to be a real gamer.
237000	240000	I want to read a conversation I was having with somebody online.
240000	244000	Now, I don't know this person super, super well, but they're a gamer and I'm a gamer,
244000	250000	and I was kind of trying to figure out, like, okay, maybe there's a multiplayer game we play in common or whatever.
250000	255000	So I'm going to read this conversation that we have, and I want you guys to tell me what you think.
255000	258000	So he asked me, what games are you playing?
258000	262000	And I said, I've been stupid addicted to Mass Effect 3.
262000	266000	It's the first multiplayer game in a long time I can stand to play with strangers.
266000	270000	I just got into the whole series like three months ago, played all three games back to back.
270000	272000	And he replies, is that a first-person shooter?
272000	275000	And I replied, it looks like one, but it doesn't really play like one.
275000	278000	On the easiest difficulty, your team does all the work for you.
278000	281000	I play a class that's more of a magic user, so I hang back.
281000	284000	You know, I'm trying to kind of like put it in RPG terms.
284000	286000	So I hang back and blast everything.
286000	288000	It's got a really strong story.
288000	291000	I call it more of an RPG with FPS elements.
291000	294000	Now, before you guys correct me that Mass Effect isn't truly a first-person shooter.
294000	295000	It's a third-person shooter.
295000	299000	I'm aware of this, but it has FPS elements.
299000	300000	That's the key word.
300000	301000	As in it doesn't make Jamie motion sick.
301000	302000	Right.
302000	304000	Or, you know, when it's sniper rifle, it's first-person.
304000	310000	But it does, especially when you're playing multiplayer, it kind of feels like it's got a lot of that Halo-esque vibe to it.
310000	311000	But it's different.
311000	312000	I really, really like it.
312000	314000	But here's the reply I got.
314000	321000	Eh, first-person shooters aren't real games, and the people who play them are not real gamers.
321000	322000	No offense.
322000	323000	Those are fighting words.
323000	324000	Hold on.
324000	325000	It gets better.
325000	331000	I replied, LOL, there's a big difference between Battlefield or Modern Warfare and Mass Effect.
331000	332000	Trust me.
332000	333000	No offense taken.
333000	334000	I know I'm a true gamer.
334000	335000	Happy face.
335000	338000	And the reply, LOL, if you say so.
338000	344000	I just feel fighting and first-person shooter games require no thought at all.
344000	345000	So, yeah.
345000	348000	LOL.
348000	353000	The amount of side-eye at this table right now, we're all just like, really?
353000	359000	Ask any of the people who play in the Street Fighter tournaments and how they obsess over their technique.
359000	361000	I was just really taken aback.
361000	364000	Well, anyway, I replied back.
364000	368000	I said, you know, I'm trying to be nice, but at this point I'm like, dude, what are you smoking?
368000	370000	So I'm like, fighting games is a pretty broad category.
370000	373000	I'm not very good at a lot of the modern ones.
373000	377000	But in some ways, combat on the 2600 is a fighting game.
377000	381000	Like, I'm kind of trying to say, like, dude, you're being ignorant right now.
381000	386000	So I asked back, I said, so, what does make a real gamer?
386000	388000	No reply.
388000	390000	Of course.
390000	391000	Is this someone I know?
391000	394000	No, no, this is people online.
394000	397000	You don't understand that you've been trolled.
397000	398000	No, I don't think so.
398000	402000	I think this person was very legitimate in their thinking.
402000	407000	But I'm just, I was really surprised at how offended I was at that initial comment.
407000	411000	Like, that first person shooter players are not real gamers.
411000	413000	I don't play first person shooters a lot.
413000	415000	I mean, but I've played Quake.
415000	417000	I've played Doom.
417000	418000	I've played, you know.
418000	426000	Honestly, though, that argument that first person shooters and fighting game players are not real gamers is like saying people of color are not real people.
426000	431000	I mean, it's just, seriously, that's how ignorant that statement is.
431000	433000	Okay, well.
433000	434000	I mean, it is.
434000	436000	I mean, seriously, it's like, oh, I'm sorry.
436000	437000	These are games.
437000	443000	Now, if he said casual game, like, you know, if they play Farmville, then yes, I might be able to side with that.
443000	444000	Okay.
444000	445000	I don't know.
445000	446000	Dictionary.com.
446000	447000	Gamer.
447000	451000	A person who plays games, especially computer or video games.
451000	452000	The end.
452000	455000	Do you play games on your computer?
455000	457000	Yeah, I was actually playing a couple earlier today.
457000	459000	Do you play games on a console?
459000	462000	But Jamie, one of them was a first person shooter.
462000	467000	According to the dictionary, a gamer is one who plays games.
467000	472000	And you know, I played a fighting game before.
472000	482000	I'm just trying to imagine this person, like, playing Civ 2 or Civ 3 blindfolded, like, with pins going into his body because the pain, like, brings him closer to the experience.
482000	485000	So what kind of games does this person play?
485000	486000	I have no idea.
486000	487000	I tried.
487000	488000	I asked.
488000	489000	I didn't get a reply.
489000	490000	I think this person gave up.
490000	491000	Because I'm just, you know.
491000	492000	Clearly I'm ignorant.
492000	494000	Clearly I'm an idiot.
494000	502000	There's really all games out there have some sort of, you know, strategy or actual skill involvement.
502000	507000	Well, except for, like, you know, pure random luck games like, you know, gambling a slot machine.
507000	510000	There's no sort of skill there.
510000	515000	But, um, so it's kind of stupid to say, oh, well, they're not really gamers.
515000	523000	No, I understand that, yeah, you can get a lot of people button mashing first person shooters and, you know, fighting games.
523000	526000	But you can do the same.
526000	527000	You can button mash through fucking.
527000	528000	Okay.
528000	529000	Okay.
529000	530000	Merriam-Webster dictionary.
530000	531000	Gamer.
531000	536000	A player who is game, especially an athlete who relishes competition.
536000	537000	Two.
537000	542000	A person who plays games, especially a person who regularly plays computer or video games.
542000	543000	Merriam-Webster.
543000	545000	Now I'm going to try, um, what's the other one?
545000	546000	Webster.
546000	549000	Let's go to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show.
549000	553000	Live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate live here with our show.
553000	557000	And you can check in if you're listening live at vognetwork.com and get your points.
557000	560000	And I'm going to talk about check-ins in a little bit, but we've still got some ground to cover.
560000	567000	So reading from chat, I want to start with Burr tonight because this comment that he says here is it for me.
567000	568000	It's hitting the nail on the head.
568000	572000	Burr says, you're not a real gamer unless you only play what I play.
572000	575000	And that's, I think, exactly where this guy is at.
575000	578000	And I'm going to guess, he didn't answer my question.
578000	581000	He's had a day and a half to answer and he's not answered.
581000	588000	I would guess a real gamer is one that plays Final Fantasy and, you know, RPGs.
588000	592000	Because I really wanted to counter that with, oh, so you're into Oblivion?
592000	597000	Because there's something about that whole East versus West RPG thing.
597000	600000	And I bet this guy would have been like, no, Oblivion's a first person shooter.
600000	605000	But like, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Not really, but I'm going to kill you with words.
605000	606000	Well, he's wrong anyway.
606000	607000	He is, he is.
607000	609000	We have a dictionary definition, one who plays games.
609000	614000	And I would even expand on that, that there's tabletop gamers, you know?
614000	621000	We used to say, you know, when we talk about going to a tabletop game, we say we're going to game.
621000	623000	I mean, so it's the same thing.
623000	625000	A gamer is one who plays games.
625000	631000	AcidicVampire in our chat room says, seriously, tell that guy to play Bioshock and then we'll talk.
631000	639000	There's a really good example of a first person shooter that's like definitely not Modern Warfare, Battlefield.
639000	640000	Or Portal.
640000	644000	Oh yeah, Portal's a great, I mean, Portal, Portal.
644000	646000	And that actually doesn't make me motion sick.
646000	649000	Portal is an amazing first person shooter, if you think about it.
649000	653000	Well, this is also exactly like, you know, you're not a real sports, you're not a sports fan.
653000	656000	You know, if you like hockey or soccer, you know.
656000	657000	Football!
657000	658000	Football!
658000	659000	Real football.
659000	660000	Football.
660000	662000	I'm calling it soccer because I'm American.
662000	663000	I can do that.
663000	665000	I can be ignorant like that.
665000	667000	But we all know what I'm talking about.
667000	672000	Okay, so this guy is obviously often La La Land whatever.
672000	679000	There's a reason why I bring it up on the show, though, is because what is it about this gaming culture
679000	682000	where we're so quick to judge other people and exclude them?
682000	684000	And I'm going to give you an example.
684000	687000	Going to our chat room, GameGuru says,
687000	690000	The casual games are just extensions of genres from gaming's past.
690000	693000	For example, Bejeweled is a puzzle game like Tetris.
693000	698000	So GameGuru brought up casual games, to which I say, all right, then Facebook games.
698000	702000	Sims? They're kind of sims?
702000	710000	Would somebody that plays The Sims Social and Cityville and Price is Right slots, is that a gamer?
710000	714000	The slots, no, because it's a slot machine type thing.
714000	715000	Isn't that a game?
715000	717000	This is how I look at it.
717000	721000	You have a gamer as a blanket, and then you have types of gamers.
721000	723000	You have casual gamers.
723000	724000	You have your RPG gamers.
724000	726000	You have your tabletop gamers, like I said earlier.
726000	728000	You've got your board gamers.
728000	731000	One who plays a game is a gamer.
731000	733000	It just depends on what they like.
733000	739000	But why do people feel the need, then, to assert that their way is the only way?
739000	741000	Because Catholics are like that, too.
741000	744000	No, no, no, I'm going somewhere with this.
744000	747000	It's like religion and politics.
747000	749000	The Catholics think their way is the only way.
749000	751000	I'm using a blanket term.
751000	755000	The Southern Baptists, of course, think everyone else is going to hell.
755000	758000	It's that type of mentality.
758000	762000	It's we are better than you because you don't think the way that we do.
762000	764000	You have the libertarians.
764000	766000	Oh, Lord, let's not go with the libertarians.
766000	768000	You have the socialists.
768000	770000	You've got Republicans, Democrats.
770000	772000	Everyone thinks that their way is the best,
772000	775000	and anyone who is not in their group is immediately inferior
775000	778000	because they're not in that group.
778000	780000	Alan?
780000	782000	My theory is he's insecure.
782000	785000	He's caught shit for the games that he's played before.
785000	788000	He now has a support group, and he's old enough to play the games
788000	790000	that he likes to play where he doesn't give a fuck,
790000	792000	and he doesn't catch shit for it anymore,
792000	796000	but because he's built that support group of these are the games I play,
796000	799000	these are where my friends are, he's still got that insecurity.
799000	803000	He only wants to relate to people that play the same stuff as him.
803000	805000	That's actually a fascinating way to look at it
805000	808000	because you're essentially saying the reason why he's like that
808000	810000	is because it happened to him in reverse.
810000	812000	That's essentially what you're saying, right?
812000	814000	Yeah. He's insecure, and he's got some lingering issues.
814000	816000	And I can see that.
816000	818000	He's caught shit for playing the games that he likes to play,
818000	821000	but now he's fine, but that's still his safe space.
821000	824000	I could totally see that because back when it was all about
824000	827000	Dance Dance Revolution for us and so forth,
827000	831000	there were people that said all they talk about is DDR.
831000	835000	It's not a video game show. It's a DDR rave lights show.
835000	838000	Lights don't come through radio.
838000	841000	And I know that you love this game, so this is a bad example,
841000	843000	but think back when you were crazy about DDR,
843000	846000	and someone was like, oh, I love music rhythm games.
846000	848000	And you're like, what? And they say, Parappa?
848000	851000	And you're all, hm. Okay.
851000	854000	He plays Parappa, guys! Ha ha ha!
854000	856000	Oh, here's a good example.
856000	858000	In the Groove.
858000	861000	I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna fan those plays.
861000	863000	Yeah, but In the Groove was actually...
863000	866000	No, In the Groove was fine.
866000	870000	I'm not even gonna go there. Just walk away.
870000	874000	Porkchop in chat asks, Sky, is this guy young or old?
874000	877000	It's a bit of a juvenile opinion. Mid-20s.
877000	881000	Yeah, it's kind of mid-20s. Especially nowadays, with, you know...
881000	884000	Nowadays, those whippersnaps!
884000	888000	Basically, a lot of the people I interact with on forums
888000	891000	that are of the teenage age range
891000	895000	are pretty immature, and I can imagine that they,
895000	898000	unless they finally grow up,
898000	902000	that they kind of continue to go that way through their mid-20s.
902000	904000	It's like everybody's a decade behind nowadays.
904000	908000	Well, I think at the end of the day, if you guys are going to, you know,
908000	911000	judge other people based on the games they play,
911000	913000	just kind of, you know, watch yourself.
913000	917000	Watch yourself, because we're creating this cycle, right,
917000	921000	where now, you know, that person that we point our fingers at
921000	923000	will turn around and do it to somebody else.
923000	925000	It's like we should try to be more inclusive, right?
925000	927000	Am I being too much of a hippie?
927000	929000	You're old enough to be thoroughly over it,
929000	932000	so you just don't understand why people just won't let shit go.
932000	936000	Well, and also, maybe it's just that, I mean, this, this, let me also say this.
936000	937000	This guy that I was talking to...
937000	939000	Is he from Grindr? You can tell your boyfriend.
939000	940000	Is he from Grindr?
940000	941000	Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.
941000	945000	So, well, you know about how, you know, we're trying to meet, you know,
945000	949000	other gamers, right, that we can hang out with locally and things like that.
949000	951000	So I got excited, like, oh, this is another gamer.
951000	954000	But now I'm like, I don't want to meet this guy because he's an idiot.
954000	956000	Yeah.
956000	960000	Well, also, you know, you mentioned the age group,
960000	961000	and I'm going to tell you something.
961000	966000	This is going into a little bit of biology and psychology, okay?
966000	970000	When a person is in their 20s, and this is like, for women it's like around 25,
970000	974000	and for guys it's around 27, the brain is still forming.
974000	975000	I mean, literally, it is actually.
975000	981000	So the mind is more focused on immediate reward as opposed to long-term consequence.
981000	982000	So this person...
982000	984000	Bow chicka wow wow.
984000	987000	So this person is in the mindset where everything is right now,
987000	989000	everything is immediate.
989000	992000	You don't like what I like, so I don't care about what you like.
992000	995000	What's in front of me is what's important to me.
995000	999000	And, you know, I'm sure that all of us understand that once you hit your 30s,
999000	1002000	you kind of don't give a crap about that kind of drama anymore.
1002000	1004000	So it's not as important.
1004000	1008000	I guarantee you, this person, when he's in his 30s, is going to say,
1008000	1010000	man, I was stupid.
1010000	1014000	It's like pulling up your live journal from six years ago and going, oh.
1014000	1015000	Oh, God, I did that.
1015000	1018000	I wanted to go back in time and shoot myself.
1018000	1021000	All right.
1021000	1023000	Look, we've got to move on with the show.
1023000	1027000	I just, you know, I was so struck by that conversation.
1027000	1030000	I was just like, oh, my God, I've got to bring it up on OLR.
1030000	1033000	And the one thing I didn't want to say, when I was talking to that guy,
1033000	1036000	he did not know that I did this show, like that I've been doing it and so forth
1036000	1038000	and where I'm coming from.
1038000	1040000	But it's, I don't know, it's kind of funny.
1040000	1043000	It pays to do your research, individual.
1043000	1044000	Facebook stalk me next time.
1044000	1045000	All right.
1045000	1046000	Moving on.
1046000	1049000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we're all gamers here at OLR
1049000	1051000	and so are you guys in our chat room.
1051000	1053000	And if you're listening to this on the podcast feed,
1053000	1056000	you must enjoy video games enough that you want to hear a bunch of strangers
1056000	1057000	online talk about it.
1057000	1060000	And DDR dollar bill, I can't go back in time and shoot myself
1060000	1061000	because I wouldn't be here.
1061000	1063000	So maybe I'd just smack myself around
1063000	1065000	and then use that little Men in Black thing to make me forget.
1065000	1067000	You would have to be a looper in order to do that.
1067000	1068000	All right.
1068000	1070000	Gaming week, star soccer, why don't you start us off.
1070000	1072000	You said something about being holed up in the Normandy?
1072000	1077000	Yeah, I was hanging out in the life support room and in the battery.
1077000	1080000	So were you getting it on with Dr.
1080000	1082000	Chalk was, because that's what I've always wanted to know.
1082000	1084000	But it's funny when you go drinking with her
1084000	1088000	and she starts doing the whole dancing thing is pretty funny.
1088000	1092000	Black Wolf in our chat room says Garris isn't a gamer.
1092000	1093000	I bet he plays some games.
1093000	1094000	All right, moving on.
1094000	1095000	But yeah, I've been playing.
1095000	1101000	I started Mass Effect 2 last weekend and I'm at the last set of missions now.
1101000	1106000	So I haven't beaten a game that had that much stuff in it that quickly
1106000	1109000	since Final Fantasy six or three when it was out.
1109000	1111000	So that's saying something.
1111000	1112000	No, I take that back.
1112000	1114000	I played do prison pretty quickly.
1114000	1117000	So and the DLC is all it's all really good, right?
1117000	1118000	They're all enjoyable.
1118000	1119000	Oh, hell yeah.
1119000	1123000	And yeah, they were saying that the overlord one was supposed to be like two and a half out.
1123000	1125000	You said it was like two and a half hours.
1125000	1126000	I don't know.
1126000	1128000	That was somebody else in the Senate.
1128000	1129000	But I finished it like an hour.
1129000	1130000	Yeah.
1130000	1131000	And I just rushed.
1131000	1132000	But the story's good.
1132000	1133000	And the ending is, you know, yeah.
1133000	1134000	Creepy and scary.
1134000	1135000	And yeah, that one.
1135000	1136000	Oh, my God.
1136000	1139000	I felt so bad for I mean, it's like it really sucks you in emotionally.
1139000	1141000	So you care about the characters.
1141000	1144000	And I was like, oh, my God, why don't you just shoot this guy in the face?
1144000	1146000	So, yeah, I totally, totally.
1146000	1148000	I took Samara, by the way.
1148000	1151000	Not Morant because Morant was a bitch, which is the right thing to do.
1151000	1152000	Let's be real.
1152000	1153000	Yeah.
1153000	1155000	But I have seen the Morant seduction scene.
1155000	1159000	And that was pretty funny because dude, Shep is just stupid.
1159000	1161000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
1161000	1162000	Bad voice acting.
1162000	1164000	But I'm totally going after Garrus.
1164000	1167000	But I have a save file to where I can go back for Thane if I wanted to.
1167000	1168000	The end.
1168000	1172000	So now I have to go by Mass Effect 3 tomorrow.
1172000	1174000	Mass Effect, Mass Effect, more Mass Effect.
1174000	1175000	Loki.
1175000	1177000	I did play some WoW for five minutes.
1177000	1180000	You got to get use out of that annual pass.
1180000	1182000	Yeah, well, I logged in so I wouldn't get kicked out of the guild.
1182000	1186000	Actually, I'm switching it up because I know Loki's about to go on a rant.
1186000	1188000	So let's go to, let's go to Alan first.
1188000	1190000	Alan, how was your gaming week?
1190000	1191000	It was alright.
1191000	1194000	I checked in on my Minecraft world.
1194000	1198000	I have an article that I need to finish for VOG about Minecraft.
1198000	1200000	I'm playing in survival mode.
1200000	1203000	I finally found a world that has a terrain that I like.
1203000	1207000	And I'm playing on survival mode where you have to eat and there's supposed to be monsters,
1207000	1208000	but I have it on peaceful.
1208000	1213000	And I thought, I'm going to play it on peaceful until I find a good cave and I build my house.
1213000	1218000	But I'm so into the exploration and creativity that every time I flip it from survival to easy
1218000	1222000	so that the monsters will spawn, they just irritate me.
1222000	1223000	It's not like I'm afraid of dying.
1223000	1225000	It's like I'm trying to build an expansion in my house.
1225000	1226000	Fucking go away, creeper.
1226000	1227000	So I just turn the monsters off.
1227000	1230000	So maybe the whole combat aspect of Minecraft isn't for me.
1230000	1232000	I don't know.
1232000	1234000	Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
1234000	1236000	I'm trying to unlock all the characters.
1236000	1240000	I've been working on my dude, Paragon, Mass Effect 3
1240000	1245000	because I've already seen my femshep renegade ending a couple weeks ago.
1245000	1251000	And I checked out Dragon Age 2 to see how long I had spent on it
1251000	1253000	because I haven't touched that game since February.
1253000	1256000	And I had spent 14 hours and I deleted the save so I could start over
1256000	1258000	because I don't remember a goddamn thing.
1258000	1260000	And that's it. Those are my three games.
1260000	1261000	Alright.
1261000	1264000	Can I talk about how I obtained Mass Effect 3?
1264000	1265000	Yeah, actually.
1265000	1269000	Because it was legal, but it was one of those like, hmm...
1269000	1271000	I think Loki might remember this story, but a couple months ago
1271000	1273000	when Battlefield 3 came out, there was this scandal
1273000	1277000	where people had bought codes from overseas
1277000	1281000	like the China edition of a code for cheap.
1281000	1284000	And EA wanted to disable the codes. Something like that.
1284000	1285000	I don't remember that.
1285000	1286000	Okay.
1286000	1290000	Well, I was trying to price hunt Mass Effect 3 for Origin
1290000	1293000	thinking that maybe Amazon or Best Buy or something had a code.
1293000	1295000	So I went to Google Shopping and I just said,
1295000	1299000	Mass Effect 3 sale, Origin code, and I found a site
1299000	1301000	and I'm not going to say what site it is
1301000	1303000	because I don't want it to sound like that OLR is endorsing this.
1303000	1305000	But you just told everyone how to find it.
1305000	1306000	Sorry.
1306000	1308000	Well, there's three or four sites like this
1308000	1309000	and I picked the best looking one.
1309000	1311000	We're not endorsing it. That's all we need to say.
1311000	1315000	So I found a site that had a Mass Effect 3 Origin code
1315000	1317000	for like 22 bucks, which is a huge steal.
1317000	1320000	And they took PayPal and I've had good experiences before
1320000	1324000	using PayPal on eBay where it was a fraud and I got my money back.
1324000	1326000	It takes two weeks, but I was like, all right.
1326000	1328000	If this is a scam, it's through PayPal.
1328000	1332000	I had a reasonable expectation of being safe.
1332000	1335000	I get the code within a minute of submitting it
1335000	1337000	and it's a little PNG file.
1337000	1340000	It's literally a scan of the code that you get on the back of the jewel case
1340000	1342000	if you bought it.
1342000	1344000	I put it into Origin and it worked fine.
1344000	1349000	And then in Origin it says, Mass Effect 3 Standard Edition US slash UK slash RU.
1349000	1352000	So it's some like European code.
1352000	1356000	So this site just bought a bunch of overseas codes in bulk.
1356000	1357000	I didn't have a problem with it.
1357000	1360000	Or picked them up out of a box that fell off a truck.
1360000	1361000	Yeah.
1361000	1368000	Well, actually, it depends on how the DLC codes out to the retailers
1368000	1373000	because there's been times, and I still have hundreds of them left,
1373000	1377000	that they will send you an Excel sheet with codes listed.
1377000	1383000	You guys have X amount of copies that you've ordered from this company.
1383000	1385000	Here's the codes for your PS3 copies.
1385000	1387000	Here's the codes for your 360 copies.
1387000	1391000	Some of those may be going to rental stores or libraries
1391000	1394000	or people that don't need the DLC codes.
1394000	1396000	And so there's a bunch of excess left over.
1396000	1402000	Now, I don't know about the ones that would be included in a package or whatever,
1402000	1405000	but a lot of that stuff that goes to GameStop
1405000	1407000	or even small mom and pop retailers,
1407000	1410000	there could be a bunch of that stuff lying around out there
1410000	1414000	because people didn't need them.
1414000	1417000	So I can play multiplayer fine on the official EA servers.
1417000	1421000	I'm not worried about the SWAT team repelling down and crashing through the windows
1421000	1424000	or Origin spontaneously just turning off my Mass Effect 3.
1424000	1429000	But yeah, I took a risk on one of these sites and spent $22 for a $59 game.
1429000	1434000	And I'm not saying I would do it again, but I didn't have a bad experience.
1434000	1436000	It worked out fine for me.
1436000	1438000	Interesting. See, I'm trying to figure out where to...
1438000	1441000	When I showed you the site, because you're considering getting Mass Effect 3 for PC
1441000	1443000	so that you could play with me...
1443000	1445000	Which I ended up getting through Best Buy when they had a sale.
1445000	1447000	And you looked at the site and you're like,
1447000	1449000	honey, this looks shady as fuck.
1449000	1453000	And I was like, well, I did Google the name of the site plus scam,
1453000	1456000	name of the site reviews to see if people had bad experiences.
1456000	1458000	And it looked legit, so that's why I went for it.
1458000	1462000	But yeah, there's something about the whole concept of buying overseas codes domestically
1462000	1466000	that are that cheap is weird, but I don't know.
1466000	1468000	Keep monitoring your credit card statements. That's all I'm going to say.
1468000	1470000	Well, that's why I use PayPal.
1470000	1472000	Oh, I wouldn't use my credit card.
1472000	1480000	I hope it was just excess copies in Russia or something that got unloaded on this site.
1480000	1483000	I really hope you don't get screwed. So we'll see.
1483000	1489000	I would never advise somebody to do that. You're taking a huge, huge risk.
1489000	1492000	I mean, I know you obviously very well.
1492000	1495000	You weighed the pros and the cons and went for it.
1495000	1498000	But do you think you would buy another game this way?
1498000	1502000	Or do you think maybe it's worth the extra $10 or whatever next time
1502000	1504000	to just have the peace of mind it's a legit place?
1504000	1507000	I would buy it through a legit, or more legit,
1507000	1511000	like an actual game client like Steam or Origin or Amazon.
1511000	1517000	But because I'm so broke right now, I didn't want to download a...
1517000	1522000	I think that's important to say, too, is that you are in a financial bind right now, right?
1522000	1523000	Like, I don't want to make you...
1523000	1524000	Boy, I'm making this up.
1524000	1527000	But you're at a financial not-so-great point right now.
1527000	1531000	So the fact that you could save that money and still get the game you wanted was really important.
1531000	1533000	I absolutely wanted to pay money for the game.
1533000	1535000	I was just like, how cheap can I do this?
1535000	1537000	And I found a way that worked.
1537000	1539000	Well, and there's actually, on Amazon right now,
1539000	1544000	there's a seller selling a boxed copy and everything for $28.
1544000	1546000	And you pay $4 shipping.
1546000	1550000	Although I could pay $39 on Amazon right now and buy the boxed copy and get free shipping.
1550000	1554000	So if I don't see it cheaper, it fries, pretty much.
1554000	1555000	All right.
1555000	1557000	Well, thank you for sharing your story.
1557000	1560000	Let's move on and talk about Loki's Gaming Week,
1560000	1564000	which, as I understand from what we heard at the end of Bobby Blackwell's show,
1564000	1567000	was a little bit controversial, right, Loki?
1567000	1569000	Well, yeah, some of it.
1569000	1574000	So I play lots of Minecraft, which is part of the course.
1574000	1579000	Finished my demon head entrance to my volcanic lair type thing.
1579000	1581000	And it looks pretty awesome.
1581000	1585000	Although one gripe I have about the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is,
1585000	1589000	you know how you take screenshots and stuff and you can set your gamma settings
1589000	1591000	so that you can actually see it on your TV?
1591000	1595000	It doesn't adjust for those settings when you take a screenshot.
1595000	1599000	So it was completely bright on my screen, but completely dark in the picture I took.
1599000	1600000	It's kind of annoying.
1600000	1607000	They should make it so that it shows what you have on your screen.
1607000	1612000	Then I played more Modern Warfare 3, and that was fun.
1612000	1614000	Still kicking ass.
1614000	1619000	Hopefully they're supposed to be releasing a new free map soon for Terminal,
1619000	1623000	which I believe is a remade Modern Warfare 2 map.
1623000	1625000	So I played a bit of that.
1625000	1633000	And then you may remember I talked a little bit about this whole Ready Player One contest thing
1633000	1637000	and how they have three gates or whatever that you're going to go through
1637000	1639000	and have video game challenges.
1639000	1646000	And all of them were supposed to be retro challenges kind of tied into the whole book
1646000	1649000	because it was all about old retro 80s games and stuff.
1649000	1660000	One of the challenges they had was playing Joust against this computer player and Zork.
1660000	1663000	God, I can't remember the third challenge.
1663000	1665000	I think it was playing music or something.
1665000	1669000	Anyways, so stuff like that.
1669000	1672000	So the first gate that they had was a 2600 game.
1672000	1678000	It was a brand new 2600 game that they made specifically for this whole contest, which is awesome.
1678000	1684000	It has really cool, and it kind of keeps with the whole theme of the book.
1684000	1689000	The second gate, however, not quite along those lines.
1689000	1695000	Instead, it is go play this game that's created by Richard Garrett,
1695000	1698000	the guy behind Ultima Online.
1698000	1703000	He's traveled the space and all that fun shit.
1703000	1706000	And it's a game called Ultimate Collector Garage Sale.
1706000	1709000	It's a Facebook game in beta right now.
1709000	1712000	So it is fucking broken.
1712000	1717000	Just so laggy and broken and just terrible.
1717000	1720000	And here's the best part about the game.
1720000	1725000	It's, of course, one of those free games that you would see on Facebook
1725000	1729000	that nickel and dime you for every goddamn thing that you want to do in it.
1729000	1732000	And that's no different with this one.
1732000	1734000	And it looks kind of like The Sims.
1734000	1738000	But there's already people that have completed this challenge.
1738000	1742000	And I can tell you right now, having played this game for about four hours,
1742000	1746000	there is no way you can do that in that time frame without paying money
1746000	1751000	to get extra dollars or whatever to be able to cycle things faster,
1751000	1753000	give yourself more energy, and that kind of thing.
1753000	1756000	So basically, they bought their way through this game.
1756000	1761000	And it's definitely proven in the screenshot of the first person that did finish it.
1761000	1764000	He had two credit cards sitting there right next to his computer monitor.
1764000	1770000	So it's just kind of a really bad vibe.
1770000	1773000	I mean, they went from this really cool retro game challenge thing to,
1773000	1775000	hey, play this Facebook game.
1775000	1777000	You know there's fucking money switching hands there.
1777000	1780000	And yeah, it's kind of cool that they hid some stuff in here.
1780000	1784000	But I've played this game for, like I said, about four hours.
1784000	1792000	And I've only come up with maybe two of the items I'm supposed to be finding for this thing.
1792000	1796000	And there's about, I think, 50 some items that you need to find.
1796000	1798000	And it's all random.
1798000	1800000	So there's no...
1800000	1805000	I'll be lucky to finish it within a month's time, let alone knocking it out in a day,
1805000	1810000	which I was hoping to be able to knock everything out in a day or so
1810000	1815000	because, you know, get a jump on it like I didn't quite do with the first gate.
1815000	1820000	But it's really disappointing that this is what it's come down to,
1820000	1824000	is that they have this crappy Facebook game.
1824000	1826000	And I hate playing Facebook games.
1826000	1828000	Or at least this type of game where it's like,
1828000	1831000	oh yeah, you know, you want to rummage through that box.
1831000	1833000	Well, it's going to cost you one energy.
1833000	1834000	Oh, you don't have energy right now?
1834000	1836000	You can pay some money to get some energy.
1836000	1840000	Or hey, you don't have enough money to buy that upgrade.
1840000	1844000	The type of competition you guys are playing, that was a terrible idea.
1844000	1845000	It really was.
1845000	1847000	There's no skill in this.
1847000	1850000	The skill in this is having the patience to fucking wait this long.
1850000	1853000	They got to pay for that DeLorean somehow.
1853000	1855000	He can pay for it with his book sales money.
1855000	1857000	I mean, he didn't have to do this.
1857000	1861000	Maybe the next contest will be getting to play Tabula Rasa,
1861000	1863000	the other great Lord British game.
1863000	1865000	No, I shouldn't kick him when he's down.
1865000	1870000	Obviously the Ultima series was phenomenal, so important to gaming's history.
1870000	1872000	And I don't blame him at all.
1872000	1875000	So what, he wants to create a Facebook game?
1875000	1876000	That's fine.
1876000	1878000	I have no problem with him creating a Facebook game.
1878000	1882000	I have a problem with him using this Facebook game in the state that it is.
1882000	1883000	It's not finished.
1883000	1887000	Using it to further this contest.
1887000	1891000	And yeah, it's cool that they hit all these different items in this game.
1891000	1894000	But it's not done.
1894000	1895000	It's buggy.
1895000	1901000	When I first started playing it, I ran into a glitch where I was selling stuff in my garage sale,
1901000	1903000	and the items disappeared.
1903000	1906000	And then those racks that I was using, I couldn't put anything on them.
1906000	1913000	And you're limited to a certain amount of racks that you have in your garage sale area, I guess.
1913000	1919000	And so it was stuck for a few days, and I couldn't do anything.
1919000	1923000	And then they finally fixed it, and then they had people having trouble logging into the server
1923000	1927000	because the server was down because too many people were hammering it.
1927000	1934000	And then there was an issue where the link from the actual contest to the Facebook game was broken.
1934000	1937000	It's just bad.
1937000	1942000	And I don't like, you know, I just don't like the way it's being handled right now.
1942000	1949000	But I'm still going to play it because I have to in order to get to the next gate,
1949000	1955000	or at least be able to be in the running still, so it's just sad that I have to do this the hard way,
1955000	1958000	whereas I see these guys, yeah, I beat it in four hours!
1958000	1960000	But it won't matter at the end of the day, right?
1960000	1962000	You just have to clear it in 30 days, right?
1962000	1967000	I just have to clear it within 30 days, but I just hope the last gate isn't anything like this bullshit.
1967000	1970000	Yeah, that would be a real stinker on the competition.
1970000	1972000	So that's that.
1972000	1974000	Anything else for your gaming week?
1974000	1979000	Um... I think that's it.
1979000	1982000	Alright, so my gaming week. A lot of the same old stuff.
1982000	1985000	I've been playing Mass Effect 3, a little bit of World of Warcraft.
1985000	1988000	I can't think of anything new that I tried this week.
1988000	1992000	I went back to a game from a couple years ago, just because.
1992000	1995000	I just had an itch to play it, and that's New Super Mario Brothers Wii.
1995000	1997000	I don't know, I just never finished it years ago.
1997000	1999000	I got really close and never finished it years and years ago.
1999000	2002000	So I just went back and played it a little bit, and I was like,
2002000	2004000	Oh, it's actually a pretty good Mario game.
2004000	2010000	I forgot how much of the Mario universe, not to be confused with the game,
2010000	2012000	they kind of brought into this game.
2012000	2015000	So, you know, the fact that there's Yoshi and Fire Flowers and Ice Flowers.
2015000	2017000	But anyway, it's an old game.
2017000	2021000	Either you've played it by now or you haven't, or you're waiting for the next one on Wii U.
2021000	2024000	Like, I'm sure Loki is with great anticipation.
2024000	2029000	So, I promised a little while ago we could talk about a game that I've been playing
2029000	2033000	that I didn't tell a lot of people that I was going to go play.
2033000	2035000	Because it just kind of happened.
2035000	2041000	I've been having the codes sitting in my Steam account for probably about a year now.
2041000	2046000	Because Alan trolled me when he used to hear me talk about this game an awful lot.
2046000	2051000	And he said, Oh look, it's on sale on Steam right now for just like $9.99.
2051000	2054000	I'm going to buy these codes for you, just to kind of troll you a little bit.
2054000	2059000	It was, you know, when we were, the finances were better and all that stuff and we could, you know,
2059000	2062000	throw $10 at each other to troll each other with stuff.
2062000	2065000	But I never used it. I'm like, I'm too busy playing these other games.
2065000	2067000	I'm not going to go back and play this game.
2067000	2071000	I don't have the time to sink into this crap because this game is such a time sink.
2071000	2073000	I don't have time for it.
2073000	2080000	But then last week, Shane and I were getting around to talking about the expansion pack for Final Fantasy XI.
2080000	2085000	And I realized, Oh, I have those codes I never did use that Alan got me on Steam.
2085000	2089000	What the hell? I'm going to just roll a brand new character.
2089000	2092000	I'm going to go back into the game and see what's changed.
2092000	2095000	So I've played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI this week.
2095000	2099000	And I got to tell you, yes, a lot has changed.
2099000	2102000	The game is drastically different.
2102000	2104000	Let me put this into perspective.
2104000	2108000	Loki, I know you played Final Fantasy XI for a long time, so I know you'll be able to speak this language.
2108000	2109000	You ready?
2109000	2114000	Do you know what I accomplished in three days of light gameplay on Final Fantasy XI?
2114000	2116000	No. What did you accomplish?
2116000	2122000	I am level 25 white mage with a black mage sub job already leveled.
2122000	2125000	And I did the sub job quest.
2125000	2127000	That's pretty awesome.
2127000	2132000	It might have been over three days, but you and Nikhletov have been playing a lot in the last three days.
2132000	2136000	So don't say casually in an hour you gained five levels.
2136000	2141000	It hasn't been, well, yes. Once we figured out what we were doing, yes, it has been that fast.
2141000	2146000	I guess the thing is now, one of the things that was implemented in the game that changed things drastically
2146000	2151000	is they put in these things called field manuals, which are these books that sit out in the open.
2151000	2153000	And you do what's called page burning.
2153000	2156000	You take a page and it'll say, kill six worms.
2156000	2164000	So you go out, you kill six worms, and you get bonus XP and you get bonus gil once every real world hour.
2164000	2167000	I'm sorry, you get the bonus XP every time.
2167000	2171000	You get bonus gil and this other thing called tabs once every real world hour,
2171000	2173000	so that way you can't just be getting it and getting it.
2173000	2181000	So what people do now is one of the zones, Gusk and Mines, one of the book burns is kill six skeletons.
2181000	2186000	So people go into parties there at level 10 and book burn over and over and over,
2186000	2193000	just pull skeletons over and over in alliances of 18 people just pulling these skeletons over and over
2193000	2196000	and level, level, level, level, level, level.
2196000	2198000	You're just gaining levels that fast.
2198000	2202000	And apparently you do it in Gusk and Mines, you do it in Crawler's Nest,
2202000	2206000	you do it in one of the dungeons and you're all the way to 75 in a couple days.
2206000	2211000	That's what, like, the leveling game is gone in Final Fantasy XI.
2211000	2213000	It's just you sit there and collect XP.
2213000	2218000	People go AFK and just sit there and collect the XP because the skeletons are that easy to kill,
2218000	2220000	yet you still get the XP.
2220000	2222000	Here's the thing that concerns me.
2222000	2226000	I see the look on Loki's face and he's going, oh, really?
2226000	2230000	No, I'm just, it kind of ruins, what's the point then?
2230000	2234000	I mean, why bother getting, you know, good armor and stuff like that?
2234000	2237000	You don't. It's all, because now it's all about the end game.
2237000	2239000	They went Guild Wars in their design.
2239000	2241000	They made it so that, oh, getting to max level is easy.
2241000	2245000	It's all about the end game now and getting you to end game is not a problem.
2245000	2248000	Because the end game is still hard and you've got crafting and all that stuff, right?
2248000	2252000	Crafting's still a bitch. As I'm finding out, making money's still a pain in the ass and all this stuff.
2252000	2255000	But the leveling game, now it takes no time at all to be max level.
2255000	2258000	You do still have to do, from what I understand, the limit break quest.
2258000	2259000	Oh, I hate those.
2259000	2264000	But now that the level cap is 99, then people are getting there no problem.
2264000	2267000	Just get a couple 99s to run you through all the limit break quests, you're done.
2267000	2268000	I still hate that, though.
2268000	2270000	Yeah, I know. It is kind of annoying.
2270000	2275000	So, a sitting vampire in chat says, yeah, but there is a cooldown for those book quests, right?
2275000	2278000	No. There isn't.
2278000	2281000	You get the XP every time.
2281000	2282000	Six skeletons, XP.
2282000	2284000	Six more, XP.
2284000	2285000	Six more, XP.
2285000	2289000	You get the gil and the tabs once an hour.
2289000	2291000	That just makes me think of that Eddie Izzard sketch.
2291000	2292000	Uh-huh.
2292000	2293000	You have crossed a bridge, champagne!
2293000	2295000	You have entered a shop, champagne!
2295000	2297000	You've left a shop, champagne!
2297000	2299000	You have fallen into a ditch, junk, champagne!
2299000	2303000	There actually is a zone called Sarah McGue Champagne.
2303000	2305000	I just made a Final Fantasy XI joke.
2305000	2307000	I'm done with that game.
2307000	2308000	Anyhow.
2308000	2310000	Alright, so anyway, that's...
2310000	2312000	Oh my god, something just popped into my head.
2312000	2313000	What?
2313000	2315000	A Mass Effect MMO.
2315000	2317000	Wouldn't it be awesome?
2317000	2318000	It would, but...
2318000	2320000	Bioware, do it!
2320000	2324000	Bioware did the Star Trek MMO and it's having issues, so they've got to clear those up first.
2324000	2326000	Could I play an Elcor monk?
2326000	2328000	That would be great.
2328000	2330000	Anywhere. Anyway.
2330000	2332000	That's really it.
2332000	2337000	I'm going to try to do some more writing for VoG and kind of write my thoughts a little bit more and put some screenshots up there.
2337000	2339000	So, you know, you guys have an idea of what's going on.
2339000	2341000	But, um, I was...
2341000	2343000	You know, and I've had a couple people in chat saying,
2343000	2345000	You should go back and try it. You should go back and try it. A lot's changed.
2345000	2347000	Alright, so I finally went back.
2347000	2350000	I was slow in doing it. It's like Jamie playing Mass Effect finally.
2350000	2353000	Took me a little while, but now that I'm doing it, yeah, I'm enjoying it.
2353000	2355000	Am I going to leave WoW for it?
2355000	2356000	No.
2356000	2360000	The only reason this is catching on right now is because there's not a lot to do in WoW right now.
2360000	2362000	But once the panda people hit,
2362000	2364000	I'll probably be saying bye-bye to Final Fantasy XI.
2364000	2366000	A lot of it is really about the people.
2366000	2368000	And I just don't know people in Final Fantasy XI.
2368000	2369000	Druid guild.
2369000	2371000	We need a druid guild knight.
2371000	2373000	Alright, let me know when.
2373000	2374000	Anyhow.
2374000	2375000	I would not play a turian.
2375000	2377000	But I would romance a turian.
2377000	2379000	Answering Tigerclaw.
2380000	2382000	I would play a Drell.
2382000	2386000	Ragenator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
2386000	2389000	Although I haven't played it in years, I used to love Final Fantasy XI.
2389000	2391000	It has changed a lot.
2391000	2394000	And I guess in some ways for the better, in some ways not for the better.
2394000	2395000	So.
2395000	2396000	Anyhow.
2396000	2400000	That was my experiences with Final Fantasy XI and my gaming week.
2400000	2401000	Alright.
2401000	2402000	Let's move on.
2402000	2404000	Housekeeping tonight.
2404000	2407000	I want to talk a little bit about something new on VoG Network.
2407000	2409000	First off, thank you to everybody.
2409000	2412000	The full website has been launched for 30 days now.
2412000	2414000	And I can't believe it's only been a month.
2414000	2416000	Because it feels like it's kind of been a lot longer than that.
2416000	2418000	But maybe I'm thinking about the temporary site we had and all that.
2418000	2422000	But the first month of VoG Network has been very successful.
2422000	2427000	Bobby wrote a whole little summary with number crunching like mad over at VoG Network.com.
2427000	2431000	You can kind of look at that story and see exactly how many posts were commented on.
2431000	2436000	And how many people clicked the like button and all that good stuff.
2436000	2444000	Well, one feature that has been demanded time and time again is now becoming a reality starting today.
2444000	2445000	The porn channel.
2445000	2447000	No, not the porn channel.
2447000	2448000	Maybe in August.
2448000	2453000	But for now, the podcast check-in feature is now going to be live.
2453000	2454000	Now, I want to make this clear.
2454000	2456000	For now, it's being tested.
2456000	2458000	We're calling July a test phase.
2458000	2461000	So, it's only available on certain VoG shows.
2461000	2464000	It's only available on Bobby Black Wolf, our show.
2464000	2467000	And it will be available next week on Understation Live.
2467000	2468000	That's it for right now.
2468000	2471000	But in the future, hopefully it will work.
2471000	2474000	And we'll be able to roll it out to more shows in the future.
2474000	2482000	How the podcast check-ins work is that at some point throughout the show,
2482000	2486000	and it's never going to be in the same place because we know how people like to work the system,
2486000	2491000	at some point during the show, you will hear a little prerecorded message.
2491000	2492000	And you know what?
2492000	2495000	For the podcast listeners, I'm going to make tonight's very, very easy.
2495000	2501000	To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VoGnetwork.com,
2501000	2504000	use the pass phrase, zone.
2504000	2508000	Now, for the live listeners, you didn't get to hear anything right there because this is for the podcast.
2508000	2512000	This is something they're going to have because you get to check into the shows when they're live.
2512000	2515000	But for the podcast, for whatever that word was that you just heard,
2515000	2520000	you're going to go to VoGnetwork.com and you're going to put that word right there underneath the leaderboard.
2520000	2525000	And you'll be able to check into the show, get the same amount of points that the live listeners get for listening live.
2525000	2529000	Because the point is, live podcast, you're participating.
2529000	2530000	We still love you either way.
2530000	2532000	So we want you to get the points either way.
2532000	2538000	Now, if you listen live and you check in on the podcast, you're not going to get the points twice.
2538000	2544000	Sorry, we just thought that would be too much of an unfair advantage to the individuals that have the time for both.
2544000	2549000	But you might want to still consider doing it anyway if you do happen to listen to both,
2549000	2552000	or you listen to part of one and go back and listen to the podcast later.
2552000	2559000	I would encourage you to do it because it's still being tracked in case one day there is show specific loot.
2559000	2566000	For example, we might give you some loot if you check into the podcast and the live show three weeks in a row or something like that.
2566000	2569000	I don't know. Hypothetical, we haven't designed any of that yet.
2569000	2579000	So there you go. That is now a feature that is available to you guys at VoGnetwork.com, podcast check-ins.
2579000	2583000	I'm trying to make sure if I'm forgetting anything. I don't think so.
2583000	2586000	I think, again, it could be at any point throughout the show.
2586000	2592000	I'm not going to explain it every week. If you want more of an explanation, one is available at VoGnetwork.com.
2592000	2597000	Right next to the little box where you put in the password to check in is a little thing that says, what's this?
2597000	2605000	And Bobby Blackwolf wrote a great little summary on the website at VoGnetwork.com.
2605000	2612000	And if you're listening live and you have no idea what the hell this is all about, you're missing your chance, buddy, to collect some points and maybe some loot.
2612000	2620000	Go to VoGnetwork.com, register for the site, and whenever we're live, as we are right now, you're going to see a link that says right there on the front page on the left side,
2620000	2627000	participate now and get points. And you go and you get points for checking into the show. Super easy.
2627000	2633000	Okay. I think that's that. Let's move on with some gaming news.
2633000	2641000	I need to throw this out there, though. Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, Google Plus, search for Orange Lounge Radio.
2641000	2645000	There you go. Let's get into some actual gaming news. Loki.
2645000	2654000	So, let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And the Wii U, Nintendo has already come out and said, hey, you know what?
2654000	2661000	The Wii U, it's not going to be this really expensive system. It's going to have a reasonable price.
2661000	2675000	And basically, Satoru Iwata, he said that the initial price point of the 3DS was considered relatively high by consumers and that they won't make the same mistake with the Wii U.
2675000	2683000	So, I don't know. What do you think? I was privy to a little something.
2683000	2688000	Is this Secret Club? Do we need to say don't tell other people this, that you heard it here?
2688000	2692000	I don't know. I think I've covered my...
2692000	2700000	Alright, let's go ahead and just make sure, if you're going to tell other people this big piece of information Loki's about to share, you didn't hear it here.
2700000	2712000	Well, some of this is, what, what do you mean? So, when I, the Wii U, I think is a reasonable price. It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.
2712000	2721000	There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with. What's in those SKUs? No idea. What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.
2721000	2728000	So, the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99. So, there's that.
2728000	2734000	The next price up, $299.99 and then $349.99 are the three different price points.
2734000	2740000	Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely speculative. I don't know for a fact this is what it is.
2740000	2747000	$249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.
2747000	2753000	So, system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now. You have all the Wii remotes and nunchucks.
2753000	2755000	Go on the online shop and enjoy.
2755000	2763000	Yeah, nunchucks. Done. There you go. You've got a system. You're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.
2763000	2773000	$299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then an additional Wii remote plus and a nunchuck.
2773000	2776000	Kind of like the Wii had.
2776000	2781000	I bet it's going to be that other controller, the Xbox controller. They'll throw that in.
2781000	2785000	You give yours and then I'll give mine. Never mind. I'll shut up.
2785000	2795000	And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the gamepad controller, the Wii remote plus, the nunchuck, and another pack-in game.
2795000	2803000	Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land. It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.
2803000	2807000	Alright, here's my guess. I could be completely wrong. I'm going to throw it out there.
2807000	2817000	$249.99, bare bones system. $299, that's the one that's going to come, bare bones system, Classic Controller Pro, or whatever that thing is called, and Nintendo Land.
2817000	2820000	I say you get the pack-in game at $299.
2820000	2828000	$349 will be, it will still have Nintendo Land, but it will not have the Classic Controller Pro.
2828000	2832000	Instead, it's going to have two Wii U tablets for all the games that don't use them.
2832000	2834000	$700 bucks, blow up Miyamoto doll.
2834000	2843000	Honestly, I do not think they're launching a system with two gamepads, because there's no games that support it, and people will be like, it won't sell.
2843000	2851000	That may come later on when they have games that support two gamepads, but right now, it's absolutely useless to do that, which is why they're not going to do that.
2851000	2870000	Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September, but there are the price points, release date is probably going to be the 18th of November, so hey, you figured it out two months before they're going to actually announce it.
2870000	2876000	So that's that. I think it's somewhat reasonable.
2876000	2879000	Yeah, actually $249 is kind of lower than what I thought, but...
2879000	2882000	I'm not going to get one still, but it's...
2882000	2889000	Has Nintendo launched with multiple SKUs like that since the original NES, which also came in three SKUs, funny enough?
2889000	2893000	Um, I don't think so.
2893000	2895000	So, no.
2895000	2905000	And that's all I know of right now, is that they've got three price points, because that's what they want projections on, unless they're shopping price points and saying, okay, how many of this one are we going to sell?
2905000	2909000	I don't think that they're like, we don't know what the charge for this.
2909000	2912000	$349 is way too much, I think, for the system to be out right now.
2912000	2924000	The thing that's going to be interesting, though, is that gives Microsoft and Sony enough time to where I think they could drop their console price again by the time that comes out, and $249 would not be that much of a stretch.
2924000	2935000	That's another $50 price point, or $50... I think it's another $50 drop, or are they $199,299? I can't remember right now. They may be $199,299.
2935000	2941000	Or, it could be onboard storage, like, you know, this system has more storage than this system.
2941000	2945000	Although, I mean, I wouldn't pay $50 more for onboard storage.
2945000	2946000	The Apple approach?
2946000	2950000	I don't know if they're going to do that, but...
2950000	2965000	Interesting. I don't know. We'll find out soon enough what they're going to be throwing in there, and when it will be available, but we have a pretty good hunch of what might be in there and when it might be available.
2965000	2967000	Did you talk about the online part yet?
2967000	2975000	Nope. Online is going to be free, and thank God, too, because like we've seen so far, we have no fucking clue what they're doing online.
2975000	2987000	So, yeah. Free sounds good. I mean, because honestly, I haven't seen anything offered on it that was anything more than what's on the Wii, aside from, hey, now you can put forum posts on games and stuff.
2987000	2991000	You know, which... hooray? I don't know.
2991000	3001000	Do you think they might go the route that PlayStation Plus went, where, yeah, it's free, but maybe if you do give us money, we'll give you little freebies?
3001000	3007000	Because certainly there's enough of a back catalog of virtual console crap that they could give that shit out like candy.
3007000	3014000	Um, they could do that, but I don't think that they're organized well enough to do that right now. That may be something that comes way later on. I just think they're too late to...
3014000	3024000	Something is not in the show world tonight. I know they made a major hire this week with somebody from Disney Studios is, like, in charge of their online now.
3024000	3036000	Disney had that unique thing that they did a while back where it was DGamer or something like that. Um, it was kind of like their, like, online hub thing. They had, you know, avatars and stuff like that.
3036000	3046000	And it was tied in with, like, their DS Disney games, which probably no one remembers any of that stuff. But, um, that was kind of cool, and the offerings that they had in there were pretty cool.
3046000	3052000	But I got... I hope they don't go that route because it was really stupid.
3052000	3058000	Doesn't Disney also have some fairly popular online games, like Club Penguin, I know is a pretty big deal.
3058000	3068000	And then, like, Pirates of the Caribbean. Like, I know their games are really big on having the phrases already there, and you can only pick from those phrases to communicate with.
3068000	3072000	Like, you can't type in your own stuff. They used to keep it safe.
3072000	3085000	I... cool. I just, you know... I... once again, it's... I don't want to have this so, like, chopped off of the balls, I guess. You know, where it's...
3085000	3095000	Why would I want to, you know, buy a brand... first off, why am I going to buy a brand new system that basically is, you know, as graphically powerful as my current Xbox 360?
3095000	3102000	Yeah, it may edge it out a little bit, but I don't think they're going to be really utilizing that. I don't think you're going to see games on a Wii U right now.
3102000	3107000	They're going to be like, wow, that looks so much better than the Xbox 360 version. You're not going to see that.
3107000	3127000	ActDeft brings up another good point in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. It says, Where's My Water is pretty awesome. And that's right, that reminded me, I forgot, Disney does have a pretty big footprint in the iHouse app universe right now as well. You know, with that Nintendo thing being a tablet where you're going to be able to play games on it, that seems like an interesting little connection as well.
3127000	3137000	Because obviously, Disney has the Where's My Water. They have a couple other games too. I know they own the Tap Tap brand now too. That's all Disney. So...
3137000	3145000	I just, I don't know. I don't have very high expectations for them. They're also supposed to be in September, they're supposed to be talking about 2013 titles for the Wii U.
3145000	3146000	Really?
3146000	3151000	Which honestly, I think that's... it's too... it's too early to be talking stuff for next year.
3151000	3154000	Is this the parallel Tokyo Game Show conference they own?
3154000	3163000	It's another one of their five billion press conferences that I don't fucking care about because, like seriously, just get all your shit out at one time, not this.
3163000	3170000	Well, today we're going to talk about the first three digits of the price and then maybe we'll have another press conference to talk about the last few digits.
3170000	3178000	And then we're going to give you the day of the week that the system's coming out, this press conference.
3178000	3188000	And then the next week we'll talk about which month it's coming out, and then maybe the hour or another... I mean, seriously, they waste so much fucking time with this stuff.
3188000	3194000	I mean, that's fine. People keep talking about it. They're like, hey, people keep covering our press conferences.
3194000	3196000	That's how you do it.
3196000	3204000	Yeah, but people keep covering it because they're like, wow, you didn't really announce anything. That's fantastic that you didn't announce anything. Very important.
3204000	3213000	Well, you know, when there's not a lot of gaming news, you know, that's a great time to have a press conference or it's a great time to report on people's Twitter activity.
3213000	3222000	And that's what I want to talk about here is game director Katsuhiro Harada. He is the director of Tekken.
3222000	3233000	And he posted a very interesting rant this week on Twitter. Now, I always thought Twitter was restricted to 140 characters, but he wrote a whole little essay on there thanks to...
3233000	3234000	Twitlonger.
3234000	3235000	Twitlonger.
3235000	3236000	Or Tweetlonger.
3236000	3246000	Which apparently is a thing. Twitlonger.com. And he put this whole little rant about people who constantly tell him, switch back to the voice actors used previously.
3246000	3253000	And I guess he's pretty pissed off about it. He said in this... I'm going to quote some parts of this rant here on Twitlonger.
3253000	3266000	Quote, the voice you were listening to was 16 years ago during the PlayStation period. The current generation of consoles are totally different in how they play back sound, both software wise and internal circuitry.
3266000	3278000	Quote, also you're assuming the voice actors themselves can reproduce the voice they recorded 16 years ago. Many voice actors decline work because their voice has changed since the original role.
3278000	3283000	Some have even retired. Sometimes they won't accept, even if we ask.
3283000	3292000	Quote, some might just say, just pay them to reuse the voice data, but often the voice actors decline this, or their agency declines.
3292000	3304000	Quote, Brian's laugh is the actual data from Tekken 3. As fans have requested, we've kept using the original, adapting the data recorded 16 years ago to be used on the PlayStation 2 and then PlayStation 3.
3304000	3312000	Even so, some people said it is a different voice in Tekken 6 than the original. It can't be helped, they might think that.
3312000	3316000	And he goes on to talk about the whole conversion process and so forth.
3316000	3327000	But I love this. He says at the very end of this, he says, quote, after this lengthy explanation, I will be quite surprised if there are still people who still don't get it.
3327000	3331000	Thanks for understanding or not understanding. Whatever.
3331000	3333000	Bro, you mad? You real mad.
3333000	3342000	I guess this is starting to get to him. But I can see, I can see where he's annoyed. I can see where the fandom is like, don't change it. It's perfect. Don't change it.
3342000	3352000	I like Tekken 6 sucks. I want Tekken 1. I want the voice from Tekken 1. But he does make a good point. You have to license those voices every time. And sometimes they say no.
3352000	3361000	Voice actors can step out on a green light to cross the street and get hit by a bus. What are you going to do? People die. I mean, what do they want? You have to find a replacement sometimes.
3361000	3367000	And honestly, if you like the voice acting better in Tekken 2, go play Tekken 2.
3367000	3374000	That's a good point. But I think the problem is too many people are playing Tekken 2 and not enough are playing Tekken 6.
3374000	3376000	Tekken 3 was the best.
3376000	3385000	Oh wait, here's another great quote. I have even complied to the request of you all spamming me to bring back characters from previous installments.
3385000	3392000	You often say, let's show the dev team how sincere we are by buying two copies if they bring back character X.
3392000	3398000	But did you really go through with it, expecting you to at least pre-order the game? I was met with more spam.
3398000	3403000	After you apparently didn't notice that June and Michelle actually returned.
3403000	3410000	I still have some characters left to be revealed that will comply with some of your requests, even bringing back several others.
3410000	3417000	Even so, none of them are paid DLC. I will continue to sincerely comply with fan requests.
3417000	3427000	However, I can't continue to engage the negative ones that, without knowing what you are talking about or even thinking about when you're saying blindly repeat, bring back, bring back, bring back.
3427000	3432000	He's like, shut up. Am I not doing enough? Are you people not happy?
3432000	3435000	As the magical sunglasses float from above and land on his face.
3435000	3443000	Seriously, that is seriously like the Twitter equivalent of, deal with it. This guy rocks.
3443000	3448000	I kind of wish more people would tell off their fan bases.
3448000	3454000	That rant kind of makes you want to give Tekken 6 another chance, because we did try playing it and it was kind of poopy. I didn't care for it.
3454000	3460000	Five or six. Wasn't it six? I guess. I don't know. It was six. I've lost count. It was six.
3460000	3466000	I mean, it had to be a game fly for a day, but yeah, it was probably six.
3466000	3473000	Anyway. Alright, let's move on with some other news. DarkSakura, we need to stop reporting on Twitter activity.
3473000	3481000	Okay, well, if it's any surprise, this is about Mass Effect 3. Which no one's surprised, especially Rob, because he gave me the story.
3481000	3482000	Thank you.
3482000	3491000	Yeah, the Extended Cut DLC was out and everybody is happy. Well, okay, not everyone's happy. There's still some people who are like, meh.
3491000	3498000	Which I had to stop myself from watching it, even though I watched some of it.
3498000	3504000	Okay, so going forward, they're actually talking about already doing more download content that they're working on right now.
3504000	3517000	So, it was teased in a tweet that in regards to more download content, it said, that's a trick question, we'll save the future DLC for future chats.
3517000	3521000	Don't worry though, there's much more.
3521000	3528000	Mass Effect 2 had a DLC cycle that was a year and a half, because Arrival came out I think March or April of 2011.
3528000	3529000	I think so.
3529000	3535000	And it was a 2010 game, Mass Effect 2. So, yeah, they need to, you know, DLC for the multiplayer would be nice.
3535000	3541000	And then what happens to Omega with Aria, and there's definitely campaigns they can add.
3541000	3549000	Well, I really hope the Omega thing. I'd love to see more Aria. I really hope they got Carrie Ann Moss to do additional dialogue so they can do that. That would be great.
3549000	3565000	Well, given that I've only done a little bit in Mass Effect 2 of going to Omega, yeah. So anyway, I kind of, I mean, I won't have much more of an opinion until I get into Mass Effect 3.
3565000	3569000	But there's little side characters that I kind of liked that I wouldn't mind.
3569000	3579000	I'm all about extending the game's life with DLC. In fact, I'm kind of sad that we haven't seen DLC really yet, except, of course, yes, I know the extended cut DLC.
3579000	3589000	I didn't really get into that during my gaming week, I just realized. I guess I figured most people who wanted to see it, went and got it on Tuesday, and y'all have formed your other opinions already, I'm gonna make it brief.
3589000	3595000	I've got to keep it spoiler free, because obviously Jamie hasn't got there yet and I don't want to ruin it for her. And neither should you, chat room.
3595000	3605000	I will say this. BioWare said they're not changing the ending, they're gonna just give you further details on the ending they made. That's exactly what they did.
3605000	3607000	Although I understand they changed one thing.
3607000	3610000	There is one, well...
3610000	3611000	They added something.
3611000	3627000	They added a big something, that some people say is a giant F you to the fan base, and I say, deal with it. I thought it was great. And they did change some other things that they got called out by continuity cops.
3627000	3636000	Yeah, so apparently, Maya, big thing of wondering, this is just what was cleared up for me, that my big thing of wondering, what are all of those Turians gonna eat?
3636000	3638000	Got fixed.
3638000	3641000	So I feel happy about that.
3641000	3644000	They made some stuff very clear. Very clear.
3644000	3654000	Yeah, and as far as them adding details, it was a lot of details, did it? I think it left enough people satisfied that the people that are still, like, furious about it are being brats.
3654000	3665000	But the content that we got on Tuesday should have been in it from day one. It's not that spectacular where we can go, look dipshits, it wasn't that hard. This is good, this should have been in the original product.
3665000	3677000	That's kind of the consensus overall that I'm getting from most people is that I'm happy with this. I wish it had been this way the first time. And if it had been, there probably wouldn't have been as much butthurt, and I'm okay with that.
3677000	3679000	For me, it will be in it the first time.
3679000	3682000	There you go. And, you know, I think a lot of fans-
3682000	3683000	Patience is a virtue.
3683000	3697000	A lot of fans should realize there are a lot of people like Jamie, that still haven't played the entire series, and you know, Mass Effect will continue to kind of grow in the fans and so forth. I will say this because this isn't really a spoiler.
3697000	3706000	One thing I noticed they did add at the very, very, very end after the credits and after everything is they put a little pop up message that says, you know, thank you for playing Mass Effect.
3706000	3714000	We really appreciate all your feedback and your comment, you know, kind of the PC thing they have to say over the years, and we hope you've enjoyed Mass Effect 3.
3714000	3729000	We can't wait to, you know, see you for whatever Mass Effect has in store next type of thing. So they do basically say this is not the last Mass Effect. They don't say Mass Effect 4, but they basically say there'll be more.
3729000	3735000	Like I said, the whole ending would be to be continued with DLC.
3735000	3746000	No, I don't think it's that. I think that the DLC is going to go back and add more content, like exactly how they did with Mass Effect 2. All of it is stuff that happens before the end of the game.
3746000	3755000	And one of them is a really big, the Arrival thing is a really big, big thing from what I understand.
3755000	3765000	Well, Arrival is also truly a bridge between 2 and 3, and it was the very last 3 starts immediately referencing what happens to Shepard and Arrival.
3765000	3773000	That's what I had heard. And so that's why I thought, OK, that's good. I mean, it's all stuff that ties right back in. So I'm pretty I'm pretty happy.
3773000	3779000	I mean, I get to play through Mass Effect 3 with the true ending. I mean, in my head.
3779000	3782000	You'll never experience that hurt.
3782000	3786000	Keep in mind that a lot of it got some of it got spoiled for me.
3786000	3790000	I'm going to punch you so you can experience some of the hurt.
3790000	3795000	That's OK, Rob. I'm not being punched.
3795000	3802000	Vandy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, referencing something you brought up earlier, Mass Effect MMO. Who knows?
3802000	3806000	I would quit WoW in a second for a Mass Effect MMO.
3806000	3814000	I don't think it's in the cards for BioWare after what's happened to Star Wars. I mean, if Star Wars can somehow be salvaged, maybe.
3814000	3818000	But it should just be converted into Mass Effect MMO.
3818000	3822000	No, no, it should not. They can do better, even better.
3822000	3826000	Well, I meant take the base engine and fudge with it some.
3826000	3829000	All right. Let's move on. More gaming news. Loki.
3829000	3835000	All right. So let's talk a little bit about the future. And this is kind of cool.
3835000	3841000	Mercury Steam, the team behind the Lords of Shadows game.
3841000	3847000	Yeah, it's part of Castlevania because, you know, they didn't think it could stand on its own.
3847000	3858000	They're ready to basically call it, well, move on from the Castlevania franchise after the new 3DS game and Lords of Shadow 2.
3858000	3868000	They said, we think it's, well, I think it's about wanting to leave a legacy and I don't want to be in charge of a series that perhaps over a certain time is going to decline.
3868000	3872000	I'd rather go out with a bang and leave our legacy in the Castlevania universe.
3872000	3877000	And then, of course, you know, they also said they don't want to be known as Mr. Castlevania.
3877000	3887000	And, you know, should Lords of Shadow 2 be very successful, they'd have another team do a sequel.
3887000	3893000	Of course, they were teasing that perhaps Contra is the next series that they will work on.
3893000	3895000	That'd be pretty cool. New Contra game.
3895000	3897000	I'd like to see Contra make a comeback.
3897000	3899000	Contra should make a comeback.
3899000	3906000	But it's one of those games, like, it could easily be so fucked up. Like, they could really botch it bad.
3906000	3907000	But, I mean, you know.
3907000	3910000	What was it? Was it Contra?
3910000	3913000	Would they call it on the Xbox Live Arcade one, the anime?
3913000	3914000	Oh, Hardcore Uprising.
3914000	3915000	Yeah, Hardcore Uprising.
3915000	3918000	That was pretty rad. I like that one.
3918000	3923000	So, even though that wasn't really Contra, but it was?
3923000	3924000	Hell yeah.
3924000	3927000	I mean, Hardcore Uprising is basically Contra.
3927000	3929000	I think it did have some of the music.
3929000	3931000	So, anyway.
3931000	3940000	If you like that anime-style look to Hardcore Uprising and some of those other online games, maybe you are an anime fan.
3940000	3946000	And maybe you'll be excited to hear that Viz Media is launching a subscription-based service called Neon Alley.
3946000	3948000	And it's going to be on consoles this fall.
3948000	3951000	It's a 24-hour anime network.
3951000	3958000	Viz Media is the localization company that did stuff like Bleach, Naruto, and a lot of similar things.
3958000	3960000	Yeah, they've taken it way back. They did Ranma.
3960000	3962000	Yeah, so they brought all that stateside.
3962000	3966000	They've already said it's going to cost $6.99 a month.
3966000	3974000	It will not be an on-demand streaming app, which I find kind of strange because people are paying for it, but I guess they're taking the HBO approach.
3974000	3984000	It will be an actual TV channel with schedules and all that stuff, uncensored content, HD, but it will always be dubbed in English.
3984000	3988000	I don't care anymore.
3988000	3990000	This is the other thing.
3990000	3999000	There will be advertisements, even though there is a subscription fee, the ads will be limited and they're there to keep the cost below $10.
3999000	4010000	Some of the programming coming to the channel, Naruto Shippuden, Inuyasha, The Final Act, Death Note, those are all coming to this network.
4010000	4023000	But they don't say exactly what consoles or how, but I guess we're left to assume it would be very easy for it to be a PlayStation 3 app akin to the Netflix or Hulu Plus or Vudu or any of that stuff.
4023000	4034000	And then we have on the Xbox 360, obviously those content channels are very easy to make and we've seen a lot of those, so it will be a Comcast-esque style channel.
4034000	4046000	Still very interesting because I can't think of any other on-demand channel that's run like an old-school TV network that's only available on a game console.
4046000	4050000	Very interesting. Interesting to see what could be in the future.
4050000	4055000	You know what, I'm still going to stick with fansubs.
4055000	4058000	Would you pay $6.99 a month for VOG TV?
4058000	4066000	Well, yeah, because we're far superior. And we'll play it in Japanese, I don't care.
4066000	4074000	I know you would think if it's all online it would be super easy to just have one channel in English and one in Japanese. That seems, you know, eh, that's weird.
4074000	4077000	Kind of like Laserdisc, play it in digital or analog.
4077000	4080000	Exactly, I think.
4080000	4084000	Alan, I know you're in anime, in fact you know way more about it than I do.
4084000	4085000	I used to be.
4085000	4094000	He used to be. Okay, just the other day, I'm telling this on air, we were at a Sanrio store and there was a Sailor Moon backpack and you pointed at it.
4094000	4106000	Yeah, because it reminds me of when I was 17 and not quite out yet, but clearly gay and Sailor Moon was awesome. It's pretty.
4106000	4110000	You know what, we should just marathon the entire thing from beginning to end.
4110000	4116000	I need to convert my awesome fansubs of the last three seasons I have on tape to something digital.
4116000	4120000	I've got rips of them. Yeah, Rob.
4120000	4125000	Would you pay $6.99 a month for this anime TV with commercials in English only?
4125000	4135000	Given that I haven't really watched anime with any type of seriousness in like 10 years, no, but from 98 to about 2003, fuck yeah.
4135000	4143000	I just remembered what the last series I actually paid to have shipped to me from fansubs was on tape.
4143000	4145000	It was Mamata Shugogeten.
4145000	4147000	Was it worth it?
4147000	4157000	Well, I had watched a lot of it raw because a friend of mine taped some off the TV for me and then I watched most of it and then it came out in the US and I was like, well, crap.
4157000	4166000	I hardly ever watch anime. I think the last one I watched, seriously, was it was a vampire, was it Helsing?
4166000	4167000	Helsing, maybe.
4167000	4168000	I think it was the last one I watched.
4168000	4173000	And we watched that over at Jessica's Old Place after watching Shock Treatment.
4173000	4174000	Yeah, that sounds about right.
4174000	4183000	With the projector that Evan had hooked up. I remember that. But like, I used to, I have boxes of laser discs.
4183000	4188000	You know what we need to do? Have an anime convention, but like not restricted to anime.
4188000	4193000	We need to just have a convention where it's like, everybody just fucking show up here and we're going to do awesome things.
4193000	4195000	And if you don't like it, get the fuck out.
4195000	4199000	You know what? I take that back. You know what the last series I actually downloaded everything was?
4199000	4201000	Supernatural.
4201000	4203000	There's a Supernatural anime.
4203000	4205000	And it's done by Studio Madhouse.
4205000	4208000	And I watched, no, it's like a whole season of stuff.
4208000	4212000	And the X-Men one, which was really good because I think that was also Madhouse.
4212000	4214000	But anyway.
4214000	4217000	GTFO Con. If you don't like it, GTFO.
4217000	4220000	But be proud of me. Be either proud or sad for me.
4220000	4229000	I broke out my Gatchaman episodes from 1972 and was like singing along with it because I will always sing along with the Gatchaman theme.
4229000	4236000	The last anime I guess I watched were all those Gatchaman commercials that Nintendo had after their last 3DS conference in Japan.
4236000	4237000	What the hell was that?
4237000	4243000	I downloaded all the ones that that internet provider did in Japan that were live action with S.M.O.P.
4243000	4247000	For anyone who doesn't know, S.M.O.P. is the Japanese version of Minuto.
4247000	4249000	Alright, Dark Sakura, next news story.
4249000	4252000	And then release dates, a couple more news stories.
4252000	4254000	And then the classic game of the week, which is a real good one tonight.
4254000	4258000	Well there's a game that's been announced for PC, but it was originally a smartphone game.
4258000	4260000	It's called Death Rally.
4260000	4262000	It just has the best name ever.
4262000	4268000	So it's being rebuilt for the PC with a new engine, camera, new controls.
4268000	4273000	Well of course it's going to be a new control since it was a phone game before.
4273000	4280000	And it's going to have a new track and the Shadow Man from the 1996 version.
4280000	4284000	So you should see it on Steam for 10 bucks.
4284000	4287000	So if anyone wants Death Rally, it's on Steam.
4287000	4295000	And it actually looks pretty neat, you know, because it's cars and blowing up stuff.
4295000	4301000	And it was developed in Finland, where everybody is happy and has universal healthcare.
4301000	4306000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates coming to a country near you.
4306000	4309000	Possibly Finnish release dates, we might cover that in a minute.
4309000	4310000	But first, the U.S.
4310000	4312000	Did you know that's true though?
4312000	4318000	As far as international happiness level, Finland was rated number one.
4318000	4320000	There is not much coming out this week.
4320000	4324000	What did you just do to Dark Sakura to make her squee like that, Alan?
4324000	4328000	I brought out one of my awesome Sailor Moon, Sailor Stars fansub tapes.
4328000	4330000	Look at how awesome those are.
4330000	4334000	It's got a laser print sticker on the tape too, you should open it.
4334000	4339000	To the radio listeners, it probably sounded like you grabbed her boob.
4339000	4341000	Alan, don't do that.
4341000	4343000	This is awesome. Very cool.
4343000	4348000	We had Fushigi Yugi like this for a while, back in the day.
4348000	4350000	Every episode of Fushigi Yugi.
4350000	4353000	Alright, so, sorry, we were with release dates.
4353000	4354000	Loki, not Jack and Shit.
4354000	4357000	Not much. It's literally Jack and Shit.
4357000	4361000	I don't know which one you're going to consider Jack or Shit, here we go.
4361000	4366000	The Secret World, which is a new MMO being launched, that's coming out on PC.
4366000	4368000	That looked interesting, that can be the Jack.
4368000	4372000	And then, Theater-Rhythm Final Fantasy for the 3DS.
4372000	4377000	You know, it looks like shit, but everybody that's played it has really enjoyed it.
4377000	4382000	Somebody came on here and said that was their favorite game from PAX East.
4382000	4386000	So, maybe it's one of those looks can be deceiving things.
4386000	4389000	That's out this week, huh? I might have to pick that up.
4389000	4391000	There's no demo for that or anything?
4391000	4394000	There might be, I'm not sure. I mean, there's a Kingdom Hearts demo.
4394000	4398000	There's a Kingdom Hearts demo because I finally recharged my DS so I could download that.
4398000	4400000	I would think that there would be a demo for that.
4400000	4403000	Rhythm Thief has a demo, but I don't think Theater-Rhythm does.
4403000	4405000	Hm, I don't know.
4405000	4408000	Chatters, what do you think? Which of those games sounds more exciting?
4408000	4413000	Secret World or Theater-Rhythm? I want to know. Live.vognetwork.com.
4413000	4417000	Meanwhile, Japanese release dates. Let's talk what's happening over there.
4417000	4420000	July 5th, a little more exciting in Japan.
4420000	4425000	Xbox 360. Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon gets a price reduction.
4425000	4428000	Max Anarchy is the new game from Sega coming out on the 360.
4428000	4432000	And there's also Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier comes out in Japan as well.
4432000	4437000	Yeah, I really wish it was coming out over here. Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns over here.
4437000	4439000	I was going to say, it's Anarchy Reigns, right?
4439000	4441000	Yeah, it got delayed next year.
4441000	4446000	Oh, wow. Really? So, you're going to have to import it, I guess, if you want to play it.
4446000	4447000	No, I'm not.
4447000	4450000	Because it is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4450000	4454000	Which, as you know, PS3 is region-free, so if you really wanted to play it, you could.
4454000	4458000	Other games out on the PS3 this week. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier.
4458000	4461000	Tactical Assault Commander 3 gets a price reduction.
4461000	4467000	Or it's, I guess, the camouflage version. Oh, no, that's $129. That's not a price reduction.
4467000	4470000	I don't know what that is. Oh, this is a... Never mind. You know what that is?
4470000	4478000	American... It's one of those little MechWarrior mouse slash number pad slash draw...
4478000	4482000	It's one of these things. Look. It's one of those. It's not a game.
4482000	4486000	It's a peripheral that has the mouse. But it's for the PS3, which is interesting.
4486000	4490000	So, it's definitely for more tactical-based strategy games.
4490000	4495000	Batman, Arkham Asylum, and Arkham City get price reductions in Japan this week,
4495000	4499000	as they are released into the PS3, the best collection.
4499000	4503000	Looking at the handhelds here real quick, on the Vita, you have a game called
4503000	4508000	Dokuro comes out this week. I do not know...
4508000	4511000	I'm trying to think what this game is over here.
4511000	4516000	I thought I saw a preview for this, and I can't think of what this is called over here.
4516000	4520000	I've seen this somewhere. Yeah.
4520000	4522000	I don't know what you're talking about.
4522000	4525000	Let me see if these screenshots look familiar to you.
4525000	4529000	It's on the Vita. This is Dokuro.
4529000	4533000	I thought I saw this in one of the PS3 conferences, and it looked interesting to me.
4533000	4538000	Looks interesting. Looks like a little bit of a side-scroller.
4538000	4541000	Kind of has a gothic-esque theme to it.
4541000	4545000	Looks a little bit like the Nightmare Before Christmas.
4545000	4551000	Lastly, on the 3DS this week, there are some more peripherals,
4551000	4560000	but as far as games go, we have Sekaiju no Meikyu 4 Denshu no Kaioshin
4560000	4566000	comes out this week, and that is...
4566000	4570000	a game where you make your own character and set up a team of explorers
4570000	4573000	and go through labyrinths. Hey, Rob, it's an anime.
4573000	4576000	Is it? Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan.
4576000	4578000	Thank you. Dokuro means skull.
4578000	4583000	Maybe that's why it looks familiar. I've seen a cartoon version or something on YouTube.
4583000	4588000	Lastly, on the 3DS this week, Danball Senkai Baku Boost
4588000	4592000	comes out this week from level 5. I believe it's...
4592000	4594000	I think it means skull.
4594000	4600000	This is another one of those mech knights type of fighting games.
4600000	4604000	There you go. Let's travel to the UK.
4604000	4608000	On the 3rd, the Secret World. And on the 4th, Rainbow Moon,
4608000	4612000	which makes me now think of Sailor Moon. Thank you, Alan.
4612000	4618000	On the 6th, we have Beat the Beat Rhythm Paradise,
4618000	4625000	Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends, and Theater Rhythm Final Fantasy.
4625000	4627000	That's it.
4627000	4630000	Some feedback on the release dates from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4630000	4634000	Stan says, I want to play Max Anarchy. Bayonetta's in it.
4634000	4638000	S is the guy from Madworld.
4638000	4640000	He's one of the main characters in it.
4640000	4643000	In fact, I think a lot of the characters from Madworld are in there.
4643000	4646000	I want to say a lot of the villains are.
4646000	4648000	It looks interesting.
4648000	4652000	Why isn't Bayonetta 2 already a thing that came out in Japan last year?
4652000	4654000	That's a great question. Why is that not a thing?
4654000	4658000	It's because a developer probably wants to make it, but I don't think it was profitable.
4658000	4661000	I mean, it was somewhat profitable, but it's still a niche title,
4661000	4663000	but I think that they totally would do that.
4663000	4666000	Because it's the guy who left Capcom Platinum Games.
4666000	4669000	It's his studio that made it, and they're working on something else big now.
4669000	4671000	Metal Gear Rising.
4671000	4675000	That would be a distraction.
4675000	4678000	Probably preventing a Bayonetta 2.
4678000	4680000	Unless Bayonetta is a secret character in Metal Gear Rising.
4680000	4683000	Let's fucking hope. For real.
4683000	4686000	You know, actually, the guy from Madworld would be a good character for that,
4686000	4690000	because since it's all the cutting stuff, you could get him in there with his chainsaw arm.
4690000	4692000	Nice.
4692000	4695000	Alright, a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4695000	4697000	But first, Loki.
4697000	4701000	So, you know, I really hate it when there's an awesome game coming out,
4701000	4704000	and then it's all fucking buggy, Bethesda.
4704000	4709000	So, Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC just came out this week,
4709000	4712000	and apparently it is really buggy.
4712000	4720000	A bunch of the PC users have kind of gathered on the Ubisoft forums
4720000	4724000	and made a bug report for them.
4724000	4729000	Letting them know, you know, what exactly the issues are.
4729000	4737000	And, you know, apparently it ranges from everything that, you know,
4737000	4743000	the mouse doesn't work to some other minor things.
4743000	4750000	I don't know. It's just kind of bad, I guess.
4750000	4752000	I don't know. I'm not much of a PC player.
4752000	4755000	I would have thought, though, they took the extra time to get the PC version right.
4755000	4757000	I mean, because this game came out back in May,
4757000	4761000	and the PC version not until, you know, the end of June.
4761000	4768000	And so now they just kind of, eh.
4768000	4769000	I don't know.
4769000	4773000	Test your shit. I mean, seriously.
4773000	4775000	They literally have broken it down.
4775000	4776000	They've broken it down.
4776000	4780000	The hardware compatibility, input FPS resolution, graphic issues in game,
4780000	4784000	online, audio menus, and other.
4784000	4790000	Why is it that these companies treat gamers like they're beta testers
4790000	4794000	and not like they're fucking, you know, customers?
4794000	4796000	I mean, that's stupid.
4796000	4797000	Oh, shit.
4797000	4798000	We pre-order anyway.
4798000	4800000	We didn't know those tires fell off of the car.
4800000	4805000	I mean, if we had driven it, we would have surely noticed that that was the case.
4805000	4807000	Your steering wheel only turns to the left?
4807000	4809000	Well, that's unfortunate.
4809000	4813000	You know, thankfully our track, you know, we turned to the left.
4813000	4816000	And so, yeah.
4816000	4817000	Huh.
4817000	4820000	Well, now we talked a little bit before about anime.
4820000	4823000	And I might not be the biggest anime fan in the world.
4823000	4824000	I mean, it's all right.
4824000	4830000	But one thing I do love is I love the stuff that comes from Miyazaki and all that stuff.
4830000	4835000	So you know I'm looking forward to Ni no Kuni, which is the,
4835000	4837000	or I guess that's already out in Japan, actually.
4837000	4842000	But the English translation is coming out finally soon.
4842000	4846000	And in Europe, there is going to be a Wizards edition that comes out.
4846000	4849000	And it's going to have a copy of what's called the Wizards Companion,
4849000	4851000	which is the spell book used in game.
4851000	4853000	There's a Drippy doll.
4853000	4854000	It doesn't actually drip.
4854000	4856000	Drippy is the little character that comes with it.
4856000	4859000	You get some other DLC stuff with this.
4859000	4864000	And that will be out when the game comes out on January 25th.
4864000	4865000	And some good news.
4865000	4867000	It was announced for North America shortly afterwards.
4867000	4874000	However, you can only get it on Namco's online shop at store.namcobandigames.com.
4874000	4877000	It will set you back $99.99.
4877000	4880000	But I got to say, looks pretty awesome.
4880000	4881000	I'm really looking forward to this game.
4881000	4884000	So that's one I'll be playing early next year for sure.
4884000	4885000	Ni no Kuni.
4885000	4889000	I think I'm sort of past that phase where I'm buying special editions of just about everything.
4889000	4890000	Yeah, me too.
4890000	4892000	And I hate the DLC stuff.
4892000	4898000	I think my burn phase was when I bought the Cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast.
4898000	4903000	Paid 90 bucks for a plate and a clock and a fork and a spoon.
4903000	4904000	And a pillowcase.
4904000	4911000	I mean if the collector's edition is $10 more or $20 maybe tops and it's a series I really love, then maybe.
4911000	4914000	But you are asking me to take a big risk here on Ni no Kuni.
4914000	4916000	Sometimes those collector's editions kind of bomb too.
4916000	4918000	Like the Tron video game.
4918000	4920000	I see those collector's editions still on clearance.
4920000	4923000	It's been almost a year and a half since the movie and the game.
4923000	4927000	So people are still trying to unload those collector's editions.
4927000	4929000	Even popular ones like Halo Reach and stuff.
4929000	4930000	That's true.
4930000	4931000	A ton of those.
4931000	4932000	Yeah.
4932000	4933000	Alright.
4933000	4937000	Well, let's go back to a time when things were simpler.
4937000	4946000	We didn't have $400 collector's editions of games or games that come with leather jackets which I think was a thing a couple weeks ago.
4946000	4948000	A time when games were classic.
4948000	4953000	You bought the $50 game and if you didn't like it the way it was out of the box then F you.
4953000	4957000	Or when you would go around from store to store so that you could get the Killer Instinct CD.
4957000	4961000	And sometimes these games that you would buy would be hard as hell too.
4961000	4963000	And I think that's a very important thing to state.
4963000	4966000	And God, I hope you were good.
4966000	4969000	Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.
4969000	4971000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4971000	4973000	Ninja Gaiden for the NES.
4973000	4975000	Specifically, the NES version.
4975000	4978000	It's hard as fuck.
4978000	4983000	In Japan it was called Ninja Ryukenden which is Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword.
4983000	4988000	And in Europe it was Shadow Warriors because there was this big taboo about using the word ninja.
4988000	4993000	For example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles over there.
4993000	4995000	There you go. I know my stuff.
4995000	5002000	So it was a little platformer where you beat people up and chopped them in half with your sword.
5002000	5007000	And it was ported to the PC Engine.
5007000	5009000	Actually, let me start back.
5009000	5016000	It came out in December 1988 in Japan, March 1989 in North America, and September 1991 in Europe.
5016000	5025000	There was a PC Engine version in 1992 and a Super NES version as part of the Ninja Gaiden trilogy in 1995.
5025000	5028000	And there's been mobile phone versions with episodic content.
5028000	5032000	And it's now on the Virtual Console as of 2007.
5032000	5047000	So you play as Ryu Hayabusa, who we might also know from Dead or Alive and the current Ninja Gaiden games.
5047000	5055000	So he's learned that someone named the Jockio plans to take control of the world by using demon power.
5055000	5059000	So you have to go through all the different acts and you have 20 levels.
5059000	5062000	And it's hard. Hard, hard, hard, hard.
5062000	5074000	More than that, the big thing is that it had such an elaborate story and used cinematic cut scenes as far as an 8-bit system could handle.
5074000	5080000	Which were epic as fuck at the time. Seriously.
5080000	5086000	And it even had a novelization done in...
5086000	5088000	Oh, it was one of the FX9 books, wasn't it?
5088000	5090000	Yeah, the Worlds of Power-ness.
5090000	5091000	Oh, that's right!
5091000	5094000	And he actually kind of had something to write off of.
5094000	5101000	He had to just make shit up for games like Simon's Quest, where the story for Simon's Quest was really strange.
5101000	5105000	But yeah, he actually was able to keep the Ninja Gaiden one pretty close to the cinematics.
5105000	5106000	Yeah.
5106000	5110000	So basically, it's just super hard.
5110000	5112000	This is a game I haven't eaten.
5112000	5118000	You can use Shuriken, you can use your spiritual strength power.
5118000	5122000	You also get Shuriken that work like boomerangs.
5122000	5126000	You get different types of things that will freeze your enemies.
5126000	5129000	The fire wheels. All kinds of neat stuff.
5129000	5132000	And even with that, no one can beat it. Sorry, it's impossible.
5132000	5133000	It just won't happen.
5133000	5136000	I know people who have beaten it.
5136000	5137000	But I don't think Dan's beaten it.
5137000	5141000	I've gotten to the last fucking stage and there's a jump that is so hard.
5141000	5146000	It was controller-throwing, rage-inducing.
5146000	5148000	Alan knows what I'm like when I'm mad.
5148000	5151000	That was one of them that made me mad.
5151000	5152000	It's like you would jump.
5152000	5158000	Actually, if anyone wants to see the best rendition of how every gamer feels playing this game,
5158000	5165000	look at the Angry Video Game Nerd's little video about this game.
5165000	5167000	That is everybody playing this game.
5167000	5173000	My one difficult NES game triumph is that I beat the original Ninja Turtles NES game,
5173000	5175000	which also has a rep for being hard as hell.
5175000	5176000	You know, it's an American-made game.
5176000	5181000	I beat that twice and all the other times I couldn't get past the final boss.
5181000	5185000	But yeah, ninja-gating is harder than that, so that's some scary shit.
5185000	5187000	Well, it was developed by Tecmo.
5187000	5191000	Another series back in the day that Tecmo did was Rygar,
5191000	5194000	which I don't know if I've done on Classic Game before.
5194000	5196000	Rygar is a pretty good game.
5196000	5200000	Of course, Tecmo Bowl.
5200000	5205000	So this one also had an arcade version that was a beat-em-up,
5205000	5208000	but they weren't really ports of each other.
5208000	5210000	They were kind of different.
5210000	5215000	And the developer said that the term ninja was gaining popularity in North America,
5215000	5220000	so that's why they made the game with the ninja in it.
5220000	5227000	And actually, the NES version was developed by Hideo Yoshizawa,
5227000	5231000	who was listed as Sakurazaki in the credits.
5231000	5237000	So you can see that if you look at the arcade credits and the NES credits,
5237000	5240000	completely different development teams.
5240000	5247000	So basically, that's where the differences came in with the two versions.
5247000	5255000	So it's just really supposed to be more like you're playing along them,
5255000	5257000	is what they were going for.
5257000	5264000	That you were involved in the story of the game as well as playing the game itself.
5264000	5270000	So because the game's title was actually too difficult for English audiences,
5270000	5275000	that's why they changed it to Ninja Gaiden.
5275000	5279000	And they were going to call it Dragon Ninja, but Ninja Gaiden just worked.
5279000	5282000	And it actually literally means ninja side story.
5282000	5286000	But it's not intended to be a spin-off of the arcade version.
5286000	5289000	God, I remember these bosses. Some of them were hard as fuck.
5289000	5293000	The first two were easy mode, but then the third one is like, ah!
5293000	5295000	Sorry.
5295000	5298000	This might surprise some people because I don't really talk about the new games,
5298000	5303000	because I'm not nearly into the new games as much as I was the old ones,
5303000	5305000	but I loved this old series as a kid.
5305000	5309000	I had this one, part two. My parents would never buy me part three.
5309000	5315000	But I did get from a friend on Super Nintendo, they did a compilation.
5315000	5320000	Well, this game had so much featuring in Nintendo Power in 89 and 90.
5320000	5326000	It was on the March-April 89 cover and referenced in Howard and Esther.
5326000	5331000	I used to read a bunch of Howard and Esther, just saying.
5331000	5337000	And it was also in the May-June 1989 issue.
5337000	5341000	It had complete walk-throughs. There was stuff in the counselor's corner.
5341000	5345000	It debuted number three in the top 30 list for July and August in 89,
5345000	5348000	just behind Zelda 2 and Super Mario 2.
5348000	5352000	You know what they need? Reg and Esther.
5352000	5354000	No.
5354000	5356000	Just saying.
5356000	5361000	So, I mean, basically, going back from this, in 2004,
5361000	5367000	Tecmo did episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for the AT&T and Verizon phones
5367000	5370000	that used the Brew and Java platform.
5370000	5374000	And the second installment was going to be released in North America,
5374000	5379000	and it just didn't come out. They didn't keep up with it.
5379000	5383000	And you know that magazine that Dan and I are into, Retro Gamer,
5383000	5389000	which is a UK magazine, they did a review and a look back on Ninja Gaiden
5389000	5394000	in the March 2004 issue, when the 2004 Xbox remake came out.
5394000	5397000	So, I mean, this game has really spawned a legacy.
5397000	5402000	It gave us, you know, you keep going, and it's given us, like,
5402000	5404000	we have characters that are alive.
5404000	5408000	And going from that, we've got the newer versions, which some are good
5408000	5412000	and some are not, and the big, flowing red scarf.
5412000	5417000	And there's also soundtracks. You can get the soundtracks.
5417000	5422000	The first one came out in 1989. So, there you go.
5422000	5426000	There it is, your classic game of the week, a real classic, Ninja Gaiden.
5426000	5428000	On the NES, not to be confused with the arcade version,
5428000	5431000	which I personally did not care for nearly as much.
5431000	5433000	It was just too different, as you touched on there.
5433000	5437000	But I seriously recommend to everybody, when we're done with the show,
5437000	5440000	go watch the Angry Video Game Nerds version of this.
5440000	5441000	And then play Ninja Gaiden.
5441000	5442000	And then play it.
5442000	5443000	And play the sequel.
5443000	5444000	And then scream.
5444000	5445000	And play the third one.
5445000	5447000	Because the second one introduces the Shadow Ninjas,
5447000	5448000	which weren't in the first one.
5448000	5451000	I would like to see how bloody knuckles, you know, people get
5451000	5454000	from punching the wall while playing this game.
5454000	5456000	Yeah. AcidicVampire in our chatroom says,
5456000	5458000	Heard the most recent Ninja Gaiden is shit.
5458000	5460000	Yeah, that's what I heard, too.
5460000	5464000	I tried not to get into the new series as much, but I hear they're hard, too.
5464000	5465000	Is the latest one three or two?
5465000	5466000	I think it's three.
5466000	5467000	Okay.
5467000	5472000	Yeah, because each one got released, like, three times with the Black Omega Ultra Hyper Edition.
5472000	5473000	Sigma, yeah.
5473000	5474000	Yeah, so.
5474000	5477000	Well, I remember it was a big deal because it was on Xbox One.
5477000	5478000	The first Xbox first.
5478000	5479000	Yeah.
5479000	5480000	It was a big deal.
5480000	5483000	All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break so we can, you know,
5483000	5486000	do break-type things, like refill our drinks and all that stuff.
5486000	5487000	But don't go anywhere.
5487000	5490000	There is plenty more to go when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.
5490000	5492000	We're going to have the FUGO Question of the Week, of course.
5492000	5494000	Your tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
5494000	5497000	And you know what?
5497000	5502000	Last week, we didn't get to do any of our big segments because we were busy celebrating with the ten years and everything.
5502000	5504000	So I think we should play a game tonight.
5504000	5508000	So we're going to do listless tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5508000	5509000	Stay tuned.
5515000	5518000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5518000	5528000	We are live on this Sunday night, July the 1st of 2012, with the 463rd episode of our show, taping live at vognetwork.com.
5528000	5531000	If you're just now joining us live, well, hello.
5531000	5536000	Come on by the chat room and say hi at live.vognetwork.com.
5536000	5541000	And if you're listening on the podcast, I hope you didn't fall asleep when I was talking about podcast check-ins earlier
5541000	5545000	because now you can get vog points just for visiting vognetwork.com.
5545000	5546000	Log it in and put in your password.
5546000	5549000	You might get some loot. You might.
5549000	5552000	But we don't give away all the secrets on how to do that.
5552000	5556000	We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here and the FUGL question of the week and all that good stuff.
5556000	5563000	But first, Alan, you're here on the show tonight, and I always like to let the guests plug things.
5563000	5568000	I know you don't run a website of your own or anything, but you do have something you do want to plug tonight, yes?
5568000	5573000	Yes, I'm selling off more video games, eBay batch.
5573000	5578000	So I was selling off duplicates. Now I'm selling off stuff that was once, you know,
5578000	5581000	normally something I wouldn't part with, but make some extra money.
5581000	5585000	No one's obligated to bid on it, but I thought the O.L. Army might want to see what I have up for grabs.
5585000	5586000	I'm going to put a link in chat.
5586000	5587000	Excellent.
5587000	5588000	So eBay games.
5588000	5591000	What kind of stuff are you selling, just to kind of give the impression?
5591000	5597000	Almost entirely handheld stuff. Game Boy Advance is the bulk of it.
5597000	5599000	Am I not coming through on audio?
5599000	5606000	No, it's just the chat room. Sometimes you guys send me mixed signals because and you guys in studio don't.
5606000	5607000	You're like a psycho girlfriend.
5607000	5610000	I don't want to sound mean, but don't always take what chat says at face value.
5610000	5613000	Multiple people have to say it before it's an issue.
5613000	5617000	And then when you guys get in on it, because one person is saying it in chat, I get really confused.
5617000	5623000	Two people have to say it in chat before it's really an issue because, like, I don't know.
5623000	5627000	I can only see the little waveforms going here so I could tell Alan's mic was off.
5627000	5632000	And I'm sorry, I ran away to turn on a light somewhere else so I didn't see that his stuff wasn't getting through.
5632000	5633000	Yeah, Rob.
5633000	5637000	But anyway, now we got it. So I just totally ruined your plug.
5637000	5641000	But that's what I do. I ruin your life. That's my role.
5641000	5643000	So how do people find your auctions?
5643000	5648000	There's a link in chat right now. It's a goog.goal link.
5648000	5652000	And also if you check the OLR Twitter feed, I don't know if you RT'd it, retweeted it.
5652000	5657000	But if you check the Orange Sounds Radio Twitter feed and just scroll down if you're a podcast listener listening to this,
5657000	5659000	they end Thursday nights. You've got four days.
5659000	5663000	I didn't retweet it on OLR because I was like, ooh, I shouldn't use the business thing for that.
5663000	5668000	But it was on my personal Twitter. I just retweeted it at twitter.com slash SKIE.
5668000	5671000	Yeah, so check Sky's Twitter. It should be a couple of posts down.
5671000	5673000	Okay, awesome.
5673000	5678000	And do we get some of the games named already? Sorry, I got confused with it.
5678000	5680000	Do we get some of the games that you are selling?
5680000	5682000	I haven't listed any of them off, but let me do that real quick.
5682000	5685000	I wish you had told me about some of these first.
5685000	5690000	I would have just given you straight up cash.
5690000	5694000	Final Fantasy 5 and 6, Game Boy Advance.
5694000	5699000	Those are the ones that have extra maps and espers and job classes.
5699000	5702000	Advance Wars 1 and 2, bundled together.
5702000	5706000	Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Four Swords, Game Boy Advance.
5706000	5715000	Final Fantasy 3 DS, Final Fantasy 2 PSP, Final Fantasy 4 DS, Elite Beat Agents,
5715000	5719000	Super Smash Brothers Melee GameCube, and Final Fantasy Legend 3 for Game Boy.
5719000	5721000	That game is 20 years old.
5721000	5725000	I didn't tell you to name them all. God damn, I'm just kidding. It's fine.
5725000	5728000	All right, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
5728000	5733000	RDGSinge says, do we get a discount if we mention OLR at the eBay checkout?
5733000	5739000	No, and I have to make very clear, this money is going to Alan.
5739000	5741000	This money is not going to OLR.
5741000	5745000	Yeah, this is not some vog fundraiser. This is me just selling games.
5745000	5747000	But he can plug his stuff because he's sitting here on the show tonight.
5747000	5750000	However, I will say this, if you do mention OLR at checkout,
5750000	5752000	we will throw in something small.
5752000	5755000	Like, we'll throw in something from the OLR vault here.
5755000	5757000	Just a something small little trinket.
5757000	5760000	Maybe an autographed picture of myself.
5760000	5762000	I'll give you something better than that.
5762000	5766000	I'm a vampire to know that Final Fantasy VI is super awesome,
5766000	5769000	but I'm never going to play at Game Boy Advance again,
5769000	5773000	and Final Fantasy VI is available four other different ways.
5773000	5776000	Plus, I have a Super Nintendo sitting right over there,
5776000	5778000	and I'm pretty sure there's a Final Fantasy III cartridge somewhere,
5778000	5780000	which is a pretty decent way to play it.
5780000	5785000	I realize it has the wrong number in front, but you know what? Deal.
5785000	5790000	All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news stories tonight. Loki.
5790000	5793000	This shouldn't come as much of a surprise since we were just talking about
5793000	5799000	all the trouble with the PC version of Ghost Recon Future Soldier.
5799000	5803000	But yeah, Ghost Recon Arctic Strike, which was going to be the expansion
5803000	5806000	for Future Soldier, has been delayed.
5806000	5809000	It's not coming out this week like it was going to.
5809000	5812000	They're citing polish as the reason to hold it up.
5812000	5816000	Yes, the polish or, hey, let's not release it with a million bugs,
5816000	5819000	like with the PC version.
5819000	5822000	So, got out of the way.
5822000	5825000	There's a new LEGO MMO coming.
5825000	5828000	Hopefully this one will last a little longer than the last one.
5828000	5832000	And it is coming from Funcom, so they kind of know their way around an MMO.
5832000	5836000	And they haven't really said exactly what this MMO is going to be,
5836000	5842000	but they have some LEGO minifigs online,
5842000	5846000	and it's going to be based on that franchise.
5846000	5849000	I didn't realize they had so many different LEGO minifigs.
5849000	5854000	They actually have one with bunny ears and stuff and little red riding hood.
5854000	5857000	It's kind of crazy.
5857000	5864000	So yeah, family-friendly game, and it's going to be coming out at some point.
5864000	5866000	LEGO minifigs.
5866000	5869000	Well, since it didn't work the last time.
5869000	5875000	And then last but not least, there is a big action movie coming out this summer,
5875000	5879000	and it doesn't feature Batman, but it features a whole ton of 80s action stars,
5879000	5882000	including Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff like that.
5882000	5886000	The Expendables 2, and it is coming out as a video game,
5886000	5888000	which was kind of leaked out before.
5888000	5890000	I think it was on the German's rating board and stuff like that.
5890000	5896000	But it is going to be a PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade game and PC game
5896000	5900000	coming out probably around the time of the movie.
5900000	5906000	It's a four-player co-op shooter, and I don't know, it looks neat.
5906000	5909000	I'm trying to see if this is more of like a...
5909000	5914000	I think this might be like an arcade-type game, you know?
5914000	5918000	Like a Time Crisis or something like that.
5918000	5923000	And obviously it's based on the movie, which I saw the trailer for not that long ago.
5923000	5926000	It's not like Time Crisis, but it's...
5926000	5931000	Man, it reminds me of the Nam game that they had on Neo Geo,
5931000	5933000	where you have your character run across the screen.
5933000	5935000	It's sort of a shooter, but not.
5935000	5937000	Do you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character?
5937000	5939000	I don't know if you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character.
5939000	5941000	Seriously, fuck that guy.
5943000	5944000	Okay...
5944000	5947000	I don't like Chuck Norris. I don't. I think he's a fucking asshole.
5947000	5950000	But that's my personal opinion. I'm allowed to voice it.
5950000	5951000	He will hunt you down.
5951000	5954000	Fuck him! I'll take him on. He's like 70 years old.
5954000	5956000	Go break a hip.
5956000	5959000	I would never actually threaten physical violence against someone, disclaimer.
5959000	5962000	Alright, let's move on with some other news.
5962000	5965000	Valve...
5965000	5969000	You want to make some more in-game movies, things in Team Fortress 2,
5969000	5972000	which, by the way, after last week, where I was like,
5972000	5974000	oh, I want to play some more first-person shooters and stuff,
5974000	5977000	I'm probably getting more recommendations for Team Fortress 2 than anything else,
5977000	5978000	just so you guys know.
5978000	5980000	So I probably will have to check that out at some point.
5980000	5986000	But anyway, Team Fortress 2 is one of the games that you can make movies with
5986000	5989000	now with the Valve Source Filmmaker.
5989000	5993000	I guess one of the videos they were showing off was this Meet the Pyro video.
5993000	5995000	I haven't watched this myself yet.
5995000	6000000	But the Filmmaker can make a movie out of any game that's running on the Source engine.
6000000	6004000	So the Source movie maker uses the same assets as the game and all this stuff.
6004000	6008000	So it's like you don't actually have to play the game to make movies
6008000	6011000	based off of the characters and all that.
6011000	6013000	It's Machinima's wet dream.
6013000	6017000	I can only imagine the fear that's in my heart
6017000	6020000	hearing that they have this and Garry's Mod
6020000	6024000	combined together into one pure evil cinematic adventure.
6024000	6026000	Half-Life 3 trailer, right?
6026000	6027000	There's a ton of...
6027000	6029000	Not to bring up Mass Effect again,
6029000	6034000	but people have ported the Mass Effect skins or the bodies into Garry's Mod.
6034000	6038000	So there are Mass Effect cartoons on YouTube made with Garry's Mod.
6038000	6043000	So anyhow, you can sign up for the Filmmaker beta
6043000	6047000	at www.sourcefilmmaker.com.
6047000	6050000	And I guess right now it's only really Team Fortress 2,
6050000	6052000	but I'm assuming there will be other games later
6052000	6055000	and plenty of fake Half-Life 3 trailers to hit the web soon.
6055000	6058000	Now if you're more of a Portal fan, Jamie,
6058000	6060000	maybe this is something that will interest you.
6060000	6063000	A Portal turret mini replica.
6063000	6065000	Don't you want a turret in your house, StarSakura?
6065000	6067000	You can get a blow-up turret.
6067000	6069000	Well, this is not a blow-up.
6069000	6072000	It is an actual mini model of the Aperture Sentry turret.
6072000	6074000	It's a 16-inch tall.
6074000	6077000	This company, Gaming Heads, is only making 350 of them.
6077000	6081000	You can pre-order it right now for release in Quarter 4 of 2012
6081000	6084000	for the low, low price of $330.
6084000	6086000	Rough, excuse me, $325.
6086000	6088000	So it's full-size, yes.
6088000	6089000	Yeah.
6089000	6090000	Not 60 inches, sorry.
6090000	6091000	I would just make one.
6091000	6093000	I've made one in Maya.
6093000	6096000	I've rendered one in 3D.
6096000	6100000	So, yeah, I don't know if it will actually shoot guns,
6100000	6102000	but apparently it does have a sound module
6102000	6106000	that plays the activation search, auto search, disabled,
6106000	6107000	and all those sound effects.
6107000	6109000	Just trying to get to that baby.
6109000	6110000	Your funeral.
6110000	6114000	And lastly, some people are very excited about this MMO.
6114000	6116000	It's Guild Wars 2, and I gotta admit, I'm pretty curious.
6116000	6117000	I want to check it out.
6117000	6119000	The launch date has been announced.
6119000	6123000	Get ready to lose sleep the night of Tuesday, August 28th.
6123000	6127000	That is the day that Guild Wars 2 is launching.
6127000	6131000	The next and final beta weekend event is planned for July 20th through 22nd
6131000	6133000	if you want another little sneak peek,
6133000	6137000	although I do believe you have to have pre-ordered the game to be in the beta,
6137000	6138000	but you never know.
6138000	6140000	You might have a friend or something that can show the game to you.
6140000	6143000	Tuesday, August 28th is the day that that launches.
6143000	6144000	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
6144000	6147000	Well, you know how there was that whole thing,
6147000	6150000	the kusu that got the Minecraft Lego set made?
6150000	6152000	There's Portal 1 now.
6152000	6157000	It's got GLaDOS' chamber, the modular testing chamber with turrets,
6157000	6160000	cubes, portal gun, and more.
6160000	6165000	So you can go to lego.kusu.c-u-u-s-o-o.com.
6165000	6167000	Kusu, whatever.
6167000	6170000	I won't want to say kusu because that's Japanese for shit.
6170000	6179000	Slash idea slash view slash 18258 pound, as in the pound symbol.
6179000	6182000	Then Gunlord for Dreamcast.
6182000	6184000	Yes, there's still Dreamcast games being made,
6184000	6188000	and you can get it for 40 bucks or you get a limited edition for 50 bucks.
6188000	6191000	It has a dragon box for 120 bucks.
6191000	6193000	So yeah, Dreamcast.
6193000	6196000	I love the Dreamcast shit.
6196000	6200000	And then finally, Sony says that their new racing wheel
6200000	6204000	is going to have double the accuracy of a DualShock.
6204000	6211000	And it's kind of a weird spaceship-shaped freaky-ass controller thing
6211000	6213000	that uses the Move.
6213000	6214000	And that's how they're marketing it.
6214000	6216000	It's going to be 40 bucks.
6216000	6218000	Seriously, this thing is fucking weird.
6218000	6220000	It uses the Move as well, so if you don't have a Move,
6220000	6221000	you've got to get one of those too.
6221000	6223000	If you don't have a Move, you're SOL.
6223000	6224000	Just don't buy it.
6224000	6229000	I mean, seriously, don't buy the steering wheel thing.
6229000	6230000	Let's be honest.
6230000	6233000	How many more racing games that are going to utilize that
6233000	6237000	are going to come out on the PS3 before the next system comes out?
6237000	6238000	Probably like one or two.
6238000	6240000	I'm linking this ugly-ass thing in the chat room.
6240000	6242000	And, Ronma, if you'll please put this on our Tumblr,
6242000	6245000	it's just completely hideous.
6245000	6246000	All right.
6246000	6249000	It looks actually kind of like a really weird sex toy,
6249000	6252000	which the Move looks like anyway.
6252000	6257000	Let's get into the FUGL question of the week.
6257000	6258000	It's my vehicle.
6262000	6265000	Every week, we ask you guys a question on Facebook
6265000	6267000	and the same question on Google+.
6267000	6269000	Put them together, and you get FUGL.
6269000	6271000	That's why we call it the FUGL question of the week.
6271000	6274000	And because I can't let this topic go,
6274000	6277000	the question of the week this week was very simple.
6277000	6280000	And the question is, what is a gamer?
6280000	6283000	And before we had the discussion at the top of the show tonight,
6283000	6285000	I wanted to know from the listeners what they thought
6285000	6287000	before you whipped out the dictionary and all that.
6287000	6288000	So let's see what the listeners...
6288000	6289000	And I purposely left it vague.
6289000	6292000	I just wanted to get a very organic response.
6292000	6294000	So I guess we'll start on Google+,
6294000	6296000	because unfortunately we usually have less answers there,
6296000	6298000	because, you know, it's Google+.
6298000	6300000	There's not a lot of people on it.
6300000	6301000	Let's see.
6301000	6302000	Ooh, we do have two answers.
6302000	6304000	Ooh, we have three answers on Google+.
6304000	6305000	Holy shit.
6305000	6306000	Okay, we're going to read them all.
6306000	6311000	ActDeft says, a miserable pile of controllers,
6311000	6312000	but enough of that.
6312000	6313000	Have at you.
6313000	6315000	Oh, I was hoping we'd get Castlevania jokes.
6315000	6319000	Seriously speaking, a gamer is someone who plays games,
6319000	6322000	whether it's only one game or type of games or many.
6322000	6324000	There are different types of gamers, though,
6324000	6326000	like casuals and hardcore gamers.
6326000	6328000	But if you play a game and like it
6328000	6331000	and probably invest time and or money in it,
6331000	6335000	then you're officially a gamer.
6335000	6337000	Let me be in line with what we were saying earlier.
6337000	6339000	Flaco Jones replied and said,
6339000	6343000	anyone who games and is willing to identify themselves as a gamer.
6343000	6345000	I like that little kind of second twist there,
6345000	6347000	willing to identify themselves as a gamer.
6347000	6349000	Maybe some folks on Facebook don't want to be gamers.
6349000	6352000	They just want to play their Price is Right slots.
6352000	6356000	Surtur says, a gamer is someone that includes video games,
6356000	6358000	phone, handheld, PC, and or console
6358000	6362000	as part of their entertainment consumption.
6362000	6365000	So does that mean like someone who budgets money for games?
6365000	6369000	Look at my house, gamer.
6369000	6372000	All right, going to Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
6372000	6376000	Raginator says, a miserable sack of lies.
6376000	6378000	Oh, there it is, another Castlevania joke.
6378000	6380000	Oh, wait, never mind. That's the answer to what is a man.
6380000	6383000	Well, actually, it's a miserable little pile of secrets.
6383000	6385000	But anyway, well, in simplest terms,
6385000	6388000	a gamer is one who plays games regardless of the form they take.
6388000	6393000	Video games, CCGs, tabletop, pen and paper, RPGs, et cetera.
6393000	6395000	Usually, and more often than not,
6395000	6399000	those that play video games pretty much come to mind first and foremost.
6399000	6402000	You know, Raginator reminded me of the Twitter rant
6402000	6405000	I wrote on that whole conversation the first time it came up.
6405000	6407000	And I said something about,
6407000	6411000	this guy has probably never played Dungeons and Dragons second edition.
6411000	6414000	Come back when you've calculated a THAC0, bitch.
6414000	6418000	I wanted to get a shirt that says I still know what my THAC0 is.
6418000	6420000	They probably make those.
6420000	6421000	Do you know what it means, Bob?
6421000	6423000	To hit Armor Class Zero.
6423000	6424000	Yes.
6424000	6425000	All right.
6425000	6430000	Redthehaze says, it's a person who enjoys video games as a hobby.
6430000	6432000	I won't distinguish between who's hardcore or not,
6432000	6435000	since that's very hipster douche sort of thing
6435000	6437000	that was being done before it was cool.
6437000	6441000	It's video games, it's for fun, and we should all get along.
6441000	6443000	I like his answer.
6443000	6446000	It's very hippie and non-hippie at the same time.
6446000	6449000	Get along or I will fucking kill you.
6449000	6452000	Kinda. I'm embellishing.
6452000	6456000	Picaruno says, I'd argue that there's no such thing as a gamer.
6456000	6459000	It's as redundant a term as breather or eater,
6459000	6463000	since everyone plays some form of game, whether you're aware of it or not.
6463000	6465000	Unless you're supremely boring.
6465000	6469000	Unless you play first person shooters, no offense.
6469000	6471000	I think he's being funny, not serious.
6471000	6474000	There's mouth breather, but that's something different.
6474000	6478000	Porkchop says, obviously, a gamer is someone who plays games,
6478000	6480000	but to go all Mr. Miyagi.
6480000	6483000	A gamer has the ability to disconnect from reality,
6483000	6485000	to travel to other worlds.
6485000	6488000	Whether it be to solve puzzles, explore uncharted lands,
6488000	6490000	or battle formidable foes,
6490000	6492000	a gamer can become one with their environment
6492000	6496000	and achieve greatness through hard work and dedication among their peers.
6496000	6497000	Or something like that.
6497000	6501000	Somehow I just thought at the end of that statement there,
6501000	6505000	it should be, and enjoy a book at your local library.
6505000	6508000	It's like, something like that.
6508000	6510000	It was a very zen answer.
6510000	6514000	It was very, like, then you see the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland
6514000	6518000	taking a big poof off the hookah.
6518000	6519000	Anyway.
6519000	6522000	Speaking, just to derail the show for a second.
6522000	6523000	Sure.
6523000	6525000	One of the things on Kotaku they like doing
6525000	6529000	is posting the really bad stock footage of gamers.
6529000	6533000	And one of them had this nerdy chick on a couch
6533000	6536000	playing a game, really weird,
6536000	6538000	laying face first off the couch,
6538000	6542000	and her friend is smoking a hookah that's not lit.
6542000	6544000	I just thought that was, like, why even have that?
6544000	6546000	Why would there need to be stock?
6546000	6551000	I need a picture of a nerdy girl sitting awkwardly on a couch
6551000	6553000	while her friend smokes a hookah.
6553000	6555000	I need this now as stock footage.
6555000	6558000	They're high on life, Loki.
6558000	6561000	I'm still in my way. I need that.
6561000	6563000	Wicked replies and says,
6563000	6565000	Great musical, by the way. Thank you for commenting.
6565000	6569000	I feel that a gamer is someone who plays games,
6569000	6572000	regardless of genre, platform, or even method.
6572000	6575000	I would consider people who are avid board game players gamers.
6575000	6579000	They play games just like someone who plays World of Warcraft is a gamer.
6579000	6582000	If it's an activity you enjoy, it doesn't matter the medium you enjoy it in.
6582000	6584000	A gamer covers lots of ground,
6584000	6588000	and the only true definition is someone who plays games.
6588000	6590000	Oh, excuse me, I have two more.
6590000	6591000	Tigerclaw says,
6591000	6594000	A gamer is a person who plays not just video games,
6594000	6597000	but all sorts of games, be it board games, the pen and paper,
6597000	6599000	role-playing games, or card games.
6599000	6600000	Lastly, Chiggers says,
6600000	6604000	Here's the real short answer, one who games.
6604000	6607000	I think we can all accept that answer.
6607000	6609000	Thank you, everybody, for listening.
6609000	6611000	Well, thanks for listening, sure,
6611000	6615000	but thanks for responding as well on Facebook and Plus.
6615000	6620000	Participating is the big word we use at VoG Network, yes, participating.
6620000	6623000	But contributing, too.
6623000	6624000	Stop giving me the death stare.
6624000	6626000	Why are you giving me the death stare?
6626000	6627000	I'm not giving you the death stare.
6627000	6628000	You are giving me a little bit of death stare.
6628000	6629000	No, no, no, no, no, no.
6629000	6630000	Hey, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
6630000	6631000	What?
6631000	6633000	Garrus.
6633000	6635000	Loki.
6635000	6636000	Well, that's like a new thing.
6636000	6639000	The first ten years were rah, rah, rah, rah, what?
6639000	6642000	The second ten years will be Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
6642000	6644000	Garrus.
6644000	6646000	Teehee.
6646000	6647000	Loki.
6647000	6652000	So, apparently, Hollywood's next big idea to bring to theaters,
6652000	6654000	since they're adapting all sorts of properties,
6654000	6661000	be it board game and movie title or comic book or, you know,
6661000	6664000	I don't know, all these reboots and stuff,
6664000	6667000	now they're going to bring back Carmen Sandiego.
6667000	6669000	As in, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
6669000	6672000	Your journey into geography.
6672000	6674000	You know a story like this is just begging for it.
6674000	6675000	It is.
6675000	6676000	It's just begging for it.
6676000	6677000	It is.
6677000	6678000	It's begging for it.
6678000	6679000	One, two, three.
6679000	6680000	Yeah.
6680000	6682000	Move up, move it, move it.
6682000	6684000	Is there really any movie needed?
6684000	6687000	I don't want to hear the dubstep version of this, though.
6687000	6688000	No, nothing beats-
6688000	6692000	Actually, that would be kind of funny.
6692000	6693000	But, yes, they're planning on-
6693000	6695000	No, we need to have a serious moment.
6695000	6698000	This is a, for real, serious moment.
6698000	6703000	I don't care if you have to blow all five of these men to get this to happen.
6703000	6708000	This movie is null and void if that song is not in it.
6708000	6710000	Can we all agree on that?
6710000	6711000	It's playing in the credits.
6711000	6713000	I mean, that credits is fine.
6713000	6716000	You know, like, doesn't even have to be the first or second song in the credits,
6716000	6720000	like the last song in the credits or second to last or-
6720000	6726000	Just have Carmen Sandiego be in New York City
6726000	6728000	and these guys standing on the street-
6728000	6732000	There's a hilarious cameo they could do.
6732000	6735000	No, she shows up in Disneyland and it's the Dapper dance.
6735000	6736000	Yes, fine.
6736000	6740000	I don't care how you do it and I don't care if these guys have aged 20 years,
6740000	6742000	get a new Rockapella.
6742000	6746000	If they can keep doing Menudo over and over, then they can do new Rockapella.
6746000	6748000	I agree with SSJ100Matt.
6748000	6750000	Rockapella needs to be on standby at all times.
6750000	6752000	Here's the weird thing, though, about it, though,
6752000	6756000	is it sounds like this is going to be based on-
6756000	6759000	Granted, it's been a very long time since I played the PC game.
6759000	6765000	I don't remember if you were also a-
6765000	6769000	I think, weren't you part of the ACME agency or something like that?
6769000	6770000	Yes.
6770000	6772000	Because she was part of the ACME agency
6772000	6775000	and then she turned to Life of Grime or something like that.
6775000	6776000	She went rogue.
6776000	6777000	She went rogue.
6777000	6780000	Was there really a fucking backstory to Carmen Sandiego?
6780000	6781000	Yes, there apparently was.
6781000	6783000	I thought it was just like, we gotta capture this bitch.
6783000	6785000	Like, that was really-
6785000	6788000	The old versions of the game, it's like, why are we looking for her?
6788000	6790000	She's bad. Get her.
6790000	6791000	So-
6791000	6792000	There was a whole story.
6792000	6795000	There was a cartoon series and the cartoon series wasn't bad, I thought.
6795000	6798000	I played the crap out of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.
6798000	6802000	But anyways, the story, it's being penned by Darren Lemke,
6802000	6806000	who did Shrek Forever After and Jack the Giant Killer,
6806000	6808000	I guess that's coming out soon.
6808000	6809000	Sounds great.
6809000	6815000	And then, of course, the movie involves Carmen Sandiego,
6815000	6819000	who's turned from the greatest detective to an infamous criminal,
6819000	6823000	and then her former colleagues try to hunt her down and she-
6823000	6827000	they uncover a conspiracy and question whether Carmen is really a thief
6827000	6830000	or a hero, which is stupid.
6830000	6838000	And then, on top of that, you know, I think they were saying that,
6838000	6844000	oh god, Jennifer Lopez is being targeted as the person to play Carmen Sandiego,
6844000	6849000	and Angelina Jolie. Really, it needs to be Angelina Jolie.
6849000	6852000	I think that she looks the part.
6852000	6855000	And Angelina Jolie would go topless.
6855000	6859000	Which, you know, there's nothing wrong with a little gratuitous nudity.
6859000	6863000	Now, I do believe that they're trying to make it a family-
6863000	6865000	She's naked under that red trench coat.
6865000	6869000	In my head, she always was naked under that red trench coat.
6869000	6874000	Now, I believe that they're trying to make it a little family-friendly,
6874000	6878000	but I would be down for the topless, uncut edition.
6878000	6886000	Unrated, you know, family-friendly, or full-on big-breasted nudity.
6886000	6889000	Sounds wonderful to me.
6889000	6897000	Yeah, so I look forward to the success of this movie,
6897000	6900000	and hopefully, you know, the Oregon Trail movie and Number Munchers the movie.
6900000	6903000	So, yeah.
6903000	6906000	Hollywood is really out of ideas.
6906000	6909000	I think that's what we've come down to, is that they're out of ideas.
6909000	6911000	You know what's sad, though?
6911000	6915000	There was one essential character in the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego TV show.
6915000	6919000	Oh, you're not going to be able to hear this.
6919000	6924000	It's very quiet on this movie here, but it's the Chief,
6924000	6925000	if you can hear that in the background.
6925000	6926000	Remember the Chief?
6926000	6927000	She was great.
6927000	6931000	She was great, and she was a character in the video games that they had and everything,
6931000	6935000	but unfortunately, that actress, Lynn Thigpen, she passed away a couple years ago.
6935000	6939000	So, unfortunately, they would have to put somebody new in her role,
6939000	6942000	or somebody old in her role.
6942000	6945000	Perhaps somebody from the Sim City series
6945000	6950000	that could maybe do some news reporting or something like that.
6950000	6953000	Yeah, but that wasn't a sassy black woman.
6953000	6956000	I don't care. It's still all right.
6956000	6959000	It could be Samuel L. Jackson, a sassy black man.
6959000	6964000	Although, since race isn't an issue, if you want to talk about somebody old,
6964000	6967000	Betty White would make a great Chief.
6967000	6970000	Oh, I don't care. Just run her over with a truck.
6970000	6972000	Or one chick from the community.
6972000	6975000	She's a sassy black woman that could play the role.
6975000	6977000	I think it'd work.
6977000	6980000	Or what's her name from Reno 9-1-1?
6980000	6984000	She could... maybe.
6984000	6990000	Wanda Sykes, because, God, she can't be in more annoying roles out there.
6990000	6991000	As the Chief.
6991000	6993000	Wanda Sykes is the Chief.
6993000	6995000	Oh, man, we probably should have done the list list tonight.
6995000	6998000	Sassy black woman you would have liked to have had as the Chief,
6998000	7000000	but unfortunately we have a different topic tonight.
7000000	7005000	That's a little specific.
7005000	7007000	Anyway, I was going to get the...
7007000	7009000	Old edutainment game that needs to become a movie.
7009000	7012000	Kathy Griffin, because she identifies as a strong black woman.
7012000	7014000	Turtle, the movie.
7014000	7020000	Vandy has a great one. Medea as the Chief.
7020000	7023000	All right, and since you all brought it up,
7023000	7029000	here's one actress who could be the new Chief from Sin City Action News.
7029000	7034000	Carol Davenport, here with a special report.
7034000	7038000	Tornado, big city, big hit.
7038000	7042000	Curse, trailer, the city animal park.
7042000	7044000	God, forget it.
7044000	7049000	Lord Partly, my hair is ruined and I said to her, yes, you're dead.
7049000	7052000	She literally just disappeared off the face of the earth.
7052000	7053000	She's a great actress.
7053000	7055000	I mean, you know somebody was just standing there off camera
7055000	7057000	with a tornado blowing it in her face,
7057000	7060000	and she was doing all that acting for the tornado.
7060000	7063000	It was just brava, brava, Carol Davenport, brava.
7063000	7067000	And you know, back when I was kind of toying out the idea of FMV actors,
7067000	7069000	where are they now?
7069000	7071000	She is not easy to find.
7071000	7073000	She isn't. I tried to find her too.
7073000	7076000	That's the interview I want more than any other.
7076000	7079000	Find me. Find her and bring her to me.
7079000	7084000	J100 Matt says he's still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo.
7084000	7089000	And Tiger Call recommended Zoe Saldana for Carmen Sandiego,
7089000	7091000	and that woman needs to eat some tacos.
7091000	7093000	I like her, though.
7093000	7096000	She needs to eat something.
7096000	7098000	I love her in Star Trek.
7098000	7100000	Well, yeah, but she still needs to eat.
7100000	7102000	Uhura had some back, sorry.
7102000	7103000	All right, moving on.
7103000	7106000	We're going to go topless wearing the world's Carmen Sandiego.
7106000	7111000	I'd even be fine with Mila Kunis doing the role.
7111000	7113000	I would pay to see that.
7113000	7114000	She is a gamer, isn't she?
7114000	7116000	She would be familiar with the subject material.
7116000	7120000	And they've done fake topless with her, but it's time.
7120000	7123000	It's time in your career to elevate it to the next plateau.
7123000	7124000	I mean, let's go.
7124000	7128000	If Halle Berry could go topless and win an Oscar to say in.
7128000	7131000	How would you work a topless scene in a Carmen Sandiego?
7131000	7135000	I would even be fine with Halle Berry doing topless chief, you know.
7135000	7137000	She could be a sassy black woman.
7137000	7141000	For me, I see Halle Berry's not very sassy to me.
7141000	7143000	I always picture monsters ball.
7143000	7144000	I don't know.
7144000	7145000	And then storm.
7145000	7147000	But anyway.
7147000	7150000	No, Natalie Portman would not make Carmen Sandiego, sorry.
7150000	7154000	Here's how you work a topless scene in the Carmen Sandiego movie.
7154000	7157000	Is that she's hiding out in Monaco at the beach.
7157000	7164000	Because I think that was a scene in, what was that movie with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo that was basically James Bond, but it wasn't.
7164000	7166000	It was, um.
7166000	7168000	I'm not James Bond.
7168000	7171000	It was a remake of an older movie. Somebody in chat will yell it out.
7171000	7179000	But you had to have seen this movie because, I mean, Rene Russo was like 50 years old, you know, and she looked great.
7179000	7182000	And she had no problem doing the nude sunbathing scene on the beach.
7182000	7185000	And even, you know, again, I've said this before.
7185000	7187000	I'm very secure in my homosexuality.
7187000	7189000	But I can appreciate a nice pair of tits.
7189000	7191000	She had a great rack.
7191000	7195000	She's just, I mean, come on, if Holly Berry's taking it off in Swordfish.
7195000	7199000	Swordfish! I mean, a movie that really didn't need that.
7199000	7200000	But she did it.
7200000	7203000	Thank you! Acidic Vampire, The Thomas Crown Affair. That was it.
7203000	7204000	Uh.
7204000	7205000	Member?
7207000	7208000	Alright.
7208000	7210000	Anyhow.
7210000	7212000	What are you snickering at over there, Darcy?
7212000	7218000	Oh, one of my friends posted one of those demotivational posters of two midgets getting into a fight.
7218000	7220000	And it says, I have a feeling this is going to be a short fight.
7220000	7221000	No.
7221000	7222000	Stop.
7222000	7223000	Alright.
7223000	7228000	Well, somebody thought this company would be a lot more short-lived than they really were.
7228000	7230000	But they've lasted a long time.
7230000	7231000	And it's Atari.
7231000	7234000	Atari is celebrating 40 years this week.
7234000	7236000	Or they did this past week.
7236000	7238000	I didn't realize their birthday was the day after mine.
7238000	7240000	But it is.
7240000	7245000	40 years ago was when Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney got together and founded Atari.
7245000	7248000	At the time, it was CIGI.
7248000	7250000	I guess that's what they wanted to call it.
7250000	7252000	But they couldn't get that name.
7252000	7254000	So they went with Atari.
7254000	7255000	Great runner-up.
7255000	7256000	So yeah, that's awesome.
7256000	7260000	40 year anniversary for Atari.
7260000	7262000	And yeah, they did a little infographic.
7262000	7264000	1972 is when it was founded.
7264000	7265000	That's when Pong came out.
7265000	7267000	Breakout was 76.
7267000	7273000	The original Atari 2600 or the Atari VCS, 1977.
7273000	7274000	Let's see.
7274000	7278000	Of course, they don't mention the big video game crash in here.
7278000	7279000	Oh no, they do.
7279000	7280000	1983.
7280000	7284000	Revenues dropped 97%.
7284000	7289000	Later on, the Atari greatest hits on the iPad.
7289000	7293000	Which, by the way, on the 40th anniversary, they just made all the games free.
7293000	7295000	So I actually played.
7295000	7296000	I didn't talk about it in my gaming week.
7296000	7298000	Because, like, LOL, Atari 2600.
7298000	7300000	But I played, like, Combat 2.
7300000	7302000	I played Sword Quest.
7302000	7303000	Which was an amazing...
7303000	7305000	There was a Combat 2?
7305000	7307000	It was a prototype that was never actually released.
7307000	7309000	And it's in that iPad one.
7309000	7310000	Is it any good?
7310000	7311000	No.
7311000	7313000	Well, on the iPad, no.
7313000	7315000	But if it had come out many years ago, yes.
7315000	7316000	Because, like, it's different.
7316000	7318000	Like, the terrain is different.
7318000	7322000	There's trees, which is different colored blocks that you can shoot through.
7322000	7326000	And it just, it kind of has a more natural look.
7326000	7327000	Kind of like River Raid.
7327000	7328000	But combat.
7328000	7330000	Like, if that makes any sense at all.
7330000	7332000	So, yes, Atari is 40 years old.
7332000	7335000	And I thought, you know, to celebrate Atari's birthday,
7335000	7339000	maybe we could throw them a listless party!
7344000	7345000	That's right.
7345000	7349000	We're going to play listless, which we haven't done in a few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7349000	7353000	So let me explain how listless works with you guys.
7353000	7357000	We are going to be coming up with the definitive list.
7357000	7360000	And it's a highly scientific process we go through.
7360000	7361000	First, let me give you the topic.
7361000	7364000	Tonight's topic is,
7364000	7371000	What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?
7371000	7374000	Because, let's be real, Atari slipped a little bit over the years.
7374000	7376000	Did any of you play Driver 3?
7376000	7380000	Did anybody actually own a Jaguar, besides Dark Sakura?
7380000	7381000	No, I haven't owned a Jaguar.
7381000	7382000	Really?
7382000	7386000	Because the only two games that were good on it, I actually own on Sega Saturn.
7386000	7394000	So anyhow, we want to do a topic, What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?
7394000	7398000	What we're going to do, each of us will go around here in studio,
7398000	7401000	myself, Loki, Dark Sakura, and special guest Alan tonight,
7401000	7403000	and we're going to give our top three answers.
7403000	7406000	And that's going to leave us with a list of 12.
7406000	7411000	And then the hard part, it's not fun, but science isn't easy, you guys.
7411000	7412000	It's not easy.
7412000	7415000	So we're going to have to go around and each person will take one item off the list.
7415000	7420000	That leaves us with a list of eight that those of you in our chat room,
7420000	7425000	live at live.vognetwork.com, can vote on to make the definitive list.
7425000	7428000	Now if you guys have suggestions, yell them out in our chat room,
7428000	7432000	because if one of our hosts decides they suddenly don't like one of the answers they wrote down before the show,
7432000	7437000	or one of the answers gets duplicated, or they simply like your answer better,
7437000	7440000	then they will use it and hopefully give you credit.
7440000	7443000	Unless they just happen to have wrote the same thing down already,
7443000	7446000	because I see one of my answers already got written down in chat.
7446000	7448000	So we'll see what happens.
7448000	7449000	Oops.
7449000	7451000	It would help if I didn't leave the chat room.
7451000	7454000	All right.
7454000	7455000	I'm an idiot.
7455000	7456000	Okay.
7456000	7459000	Let's start the list.
7459000	7463000	Of course, I can't start the list until I open up WordPad.
7463000	7464000	There we go.
7464000	7465000	All right.
7465000	7466000	Let's start off the list.
7466000	7468000	Alan, you're the guest tonight, so you'll start us off.
7468000	7470000	Alan, your number three option.
7470000	7474000	How could Atari be relevant today like it was 1982?
7474000	7482000	Combat as a Facebook game with real money microtransactions to rotate more than once a day.
7482000	7483000	I get it.
7483000	7486000	So like the little turret in line with a true Facebook game.
7486000	7490000	You have to turn once a day, but if you want to turn more, it's going to be like 50 cents.
7490000	7492000	Otherwise you'll be shooting to the right forever.
7492000	7496000	It's like a broken arcade game from 1982 where you can't move left anymore.
7496000	7497000	That's how it's going to play.
7497000	7498000	Bring combat to Facebook.
7498000	7500000	Bring combat to Facebook.
7500000	7502000	Didn't Atari actually bring some of their games to Facebook?
7502000	7505000	I think they might have, but Combat I don't believe was one of them.
7505000	7507000	So the answer stands.
7507000	7508000	Dark Sakura.
7508000	7509000	We'll let ladies go next.
7509000	7511000	Your number three answer.
7511000	7514000	Atari presents Pizza Time Theater the game.
7514000	7515000	I see.
7515000	7517000	Wasn't Chuck E. Cheese a one-time Pizza Time Theater?
7517000	7518000	No additional.
7518000	7519000	I see.
7519000	7521000	So what would happen in Pizza Time Theater the game?
7521000	7524000	You'd vomit.
7524000	7528000	And you'd have to shoot the animatronics or the pizza gun.
7528000	7530000	Do the animatronics go bad at night?
7530000	7536000	And then you'd have to run away from the employees and hide in the pole position machine so they don't give you out.
7536000	7538000	All right.
7538000	7539000	Let's see.
7539000	7540000	Stupid helicopter.
7540000	7541000	I'll go next.
7541000	7542000	I'll let Loki go last.
7542000	7546000	My answer for the thing that they could do.
7546000	7550000	Garrus 2600 is my answer.
7550000	7556000	It would just be a brand new Atari 2600 game that is Garrus' face.
7556000	7558000	And that's all it mouths things to you.
7558000	7560000	And then that horrible, horrible 2600 chip.
7560000	7562000	So Garrus 2600.
7562000	7567000	All right, Loki, your number three answer for how could Atari be relevant today?
7567000	7569000	Marvel Madness 2.
7569000	7572000	Oh, a serious answer for Loki.
7572000	7573000	That's a good one.
7573000	7574000	That's a damn good answer.
7574000	7576000	Maybe a new Marvel Madness game.
7576000	7577000	It's awesome.
7577000	7581000	Well, sure, we did get Super Monkey Ball, but that's not right.
7581000	7583000	Not even close.
7583000	7585000	Marvel Madness 2.
7585000	7586000	All right.
7586000	7591000	So, so far, we have combat on Facebook, Pizza Time Theater, the game, Garrus 2600, and Marvel Madness 2.
7591000	7593000	Let's go to the number two answers.
7593000	7595000	Alan?
7595000	7598000	You're setting something up in chat right now.
7598000	7600000	What is this?
7600000	7603000	I don't have the best relationship with chat when it comes to list lists.
7603000	7606000	I have a bad habit of eliminating their favorite answers.
7606000	7610000	So they want to lynch me and I'm trying to tell them that if they message me, that won't happen.
7610000	7612000	All right, fair enough.
7612000	7615000	Okay, your number two answer.
7615000	7623000	Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition for Steam, XBLA, and iOS.
7623000	7627000	And how would Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition work?
7627000	7631000	Just meows and she'd bounce around in his little suit.
7631000	7635000	Instead of going boop, boop, it goes meow, meow.
7635000	7638000	So it would be meow, meow, meow.
7638000	7641000	And the little Pong thing would leave Rainbow Trails.
7641000	7642000	Perfect, right?
7642000	7643000	Yeah.
7643000	7644000	President Cat.
7644000	7645000	All right.
7645000	7647000	Loki, or excuse me, Dark Sakura.
7647000	7650000	Your number two answer.
7650000	7652000	Working 5200 controllers.
7652000	7654000	Working 5200 controllers.
7654000	7661000	If anyone has ever owned one or more Atari 5200, you know the controllers are shit.
7661000	7667000	And even aftermarket controllers are kind of shit, if they just had real 5200 controllers
7667000	7675000	that you didn't have to hold a screwdriver to the contact to get it to hit start on your damn game,
7675000	7677000	then maybe the 5200 might have lived longer.
7677000	7679000	Maybe it might have caught on.
7679000	7683000	Because it has the best home version of Kix ever.
7683000	7685000	Can you tell that this is a sore point?
7685000	7687000	Maybe a little bit, just a little bit.
7687000	7690000	All right, my answer is kind of similar to what we already heard, but it's what I wrote down.
7690000	7691000	I'm running with it.
7691000	7697000	I said remake ET as a PlayStation Network Xbox Live Arcade game.
7697000	7706000	I had ET the extraterrestrial 30 year anniversary HD remake pre-order bonus via GameStop exclusive.
7706000	7711000	I was going to say remake Yars' Revenge, and then I was like, oh, wait, they actually did that.
7711000	7714000	And, well, yeah, we're sitting here now.
7714000	7721000	So I say ET, it was just misunderstood if they would just have made it a little more difficult
7721000	7723000	to fall in those fucking holes.
7723000	7728000	I played the hell out of that game, and I was seven, and children are stupid.
7733000	7735000	ET was not that bad.
7735000	7740000	There were far worse games on the 2600, Pac-Man being one of them, excuse me.
7740000	7747000	That game was shit.
7747000	7750000	All right, at least ET had that cool neck thing.
7750000	7754000	All right, Loki, your number two answer.
7754000	7760000	My number two answer would be a sequel to Adventure in the Style of Skyrim.
7765000	7769000	Yeah, it's like Atari has the most generic fucking name for an RPG ever.
7769000	7773000	They own that trademark, unless they sold it years ago, which is possible,
7773000	7775000	but they could make a sequel to Adventure.
7775000	7777000	Because remember, there was adventure.
7777000	7778000	That's true.
7778000	7781000	Wasn't there a prototype for Adventure 2?
7781000	7783000	I want to say I've heard of one somewhere.
7783000	7784000	I think maybe.
7784000	7786000	I think there was.
7786000	7787000	No.
7787000	7790000	Well, what they need is they need adventure with blood.
7790000	7795000	Like, when you kill those dragons, I want to feel it.
7795000	7800000	I want that shit that's in the Dawnguard expansion where swords go through heads
7800000	7804000	and all that stuff and all that crazy, violent stuff from Skyrim.
7804000	7805000	Adventure with violence.
7805000	7808000	Okay, number one answer time.
7808000	7812000	Adventure 2 is on the 5200, and it was a proto.
7812000	7818000	So I'm not crazy, but it was 5200, which far less people own than the 2600.
7818000	7819000	I've got two of them.
7819000	7821000	Give me one.
7821000	7826000	Alan, your number one answer for how could Atari be relevant like it was 1982?
7826000	7830000	It was originally going to be the ET1, but that's yours now.
7830000	7833000	So I'm going to say finish what Custer's Revenge started
7833000	7841000	and find a way to break into the adult entertainment industry.
7841000	7845000	You know, I think there's a hint of realness to that answer
7845000	7848000	because it's like the one place that no one else would dare to go.
7848000	7851000	But Atari could have a future in pornography,
7851000	7853000	except maybe it could be less racist next time.
7853000	7856000	That should have been my number three answer because it's more silly,
7856000	7858000	but I was pressed for an idea.
7858000	7859000	That's interesting.
7859000	7861000	Did you get that one from Chad, or did you make that up?
7861000	7862000	I made it up.
7862000	7863000	Good job.
7863000	7866000	All right, Dark Soccer, your number one pick.
7866000	7869000	You know this one because I said it before we even started this.
7869000	7874000	A new console, the Atari 1090.
7874000	7875000	Why 1090?
7875000	7877000	I don't know.
7877000	7879000	It sounds good.
7879000	7883000	We had the 7800 and I was going to do the 1080, but I don't know.
7883000	7888000	You've got ten extra points of definition.
7888000	7893000	It's 1090 points of awesome Atari.
7893000	7897000	So all those blocks will be super sharp and not too pickley.
7897000	7901000	All right, my number one answer for how could Atari be relevant
7901000	7906000	like it was in 1982, more Tempest 2000.
7906000	7910000	Yes, yes, I agree with that, Rob.
7910000	7912000	More Tempest 2000.
7912000	7914000	You know what, you should recharge my super zapper.
7914000	7916000	Yeah, they did Tempest 3000.
7916000	7917000	Yes, I do.
7917000	7920000	That was supposed to be on the Jaguar.
7920000	7922000	I played it at Atari Party two years ago.
7922000	7923000	Nice.
7923000	7924000	Freaking awesome.
7924000	7927000	But we need more Tempest 2000.
7927000	7929000	Heck yeah.
7929000	7932000	It wasn't on 2600, it was on the Jaguar.
7932000	7934000	And the Sega Saturn.
7934000	7936000	And then Tempest X was the PlayStation version.
7936000	7939000	And it had the most awesome soundtrack that ever awesomeed.
7939000	7940000	I'll play you a clip later.
7940000	7941000	Seriously.
7941000	7942000	I'll play you a clip later.
7942000	7944000	All right, but first we have to get the last answer.
7944000	7946000	Loki's number one answer.
7946000	7947000	Loki?
7947000	7951000	A combat MMO done in the style of 2600,
7951000	7954000	but you know, since they've got planes and tanks and stuff like that,
7954000	7958000	imagine armies of tanks and planes and stuff like that
7958000	7960000	fighting each other.
7960000	7965000	Kind of like the big open warfare that they have in Battlefield 3
7965000	7970000	or something like that, but you know, with really like 4-bit tanks.
7970000	7971000	I love it.
7971000	7972000	I love it.
7972000	7973000	Combat the MMO.
7973000	7976000	Sure.
7976000	7978000	I had to shorten it, sorry.
7978000	7982000	All right, so let's recap the list before we get to the eliminations.
7982000	7986000	Combat as a Facebook game to rotate more than once a day.
7986000	7988000	I don't know why I wrote it that way, but that's what it says.
7988000	7990000	Pizza Time Theater, the game.
7990000	7992000	Garrus 2600.
7992000	7994000	Marvel Madness 2.
7994000	7997000	Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition.
7997000	7999000	A working 5200 controller.
7999000	8002000	Remake ET as a PSNX PLA game.
8002000	8004000	Sequel to adventure a la Skyrim.
8004000	8008000	Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.
8008000	8010000	A new console, the Atari 1090.
8010000	8014000	More Tempest 2000 or Combat the MMO.
8014000	8015000	This is a tricky one.
8015000	8016000	These are all really good answers.
8016000	8019000	I don't know if I'm going to be able to eliminate one, but it's got to happen.
8019000	8020000	It's part of the process.
8020000	8024000	So, Allen, we start with you.
8024000	8026000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8026000	8028000	Oh, boy.
8028000	8031000	Let's see if I can do this without chat wanting to kill me.
8031000	8042000	I'm going to say Pizza Time Theater, the game, because I don't know what that is.
8042000	8046000	Oh, it's Chuck E. Cheese.
8046000	8049000	But it is removed from the list.
8049000	8051000	It's a hard one.
8051000	8053000	Well, Dark Soccer, you can get Revenge right here and take one of his off,
8053000	8055000	but maybe you'll find one you want more.
8055000	8056000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8056000	8058000	Actually, Rob, I'm going to say Garrus 2600.
8058000	8059000	What?
8059000	8067000	Because I don't want anything to mar my Mass Effect prettiness by pixelating it.
8067000	8068000	Sorry.
8068000	8069000	Garrus 2600.
8069000	8070000	I like my high-res Garrus.
8070000	8076000	Fine. Garrus 2600 is stricken from the list.
8076000	8085000	I'm going to remove Combat as a Facebook game because we kind of have two answers involving combat,
8085000	8091000	and I think Artari is kind of already on Facebook and they suck, so that's not going to save them.
8091000	8094000	It is stricken from the list.
8094000	8095000	Sorry.
8095000	8096000	Allen.
8096000	8097000	Oh, he already removed.
8097000	8098000	Never mind.
8098000	8099000	Loki, your turn then.
8099000	8101000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8101000	8105000	The Atari 1090 because I don't know what the hell that is.
8105000	8108000	You don't understand where the extra 10 is.
8108000	8110000	I don't know.
8110000	8115000	All I see it as is a lot less powerful than the 2600.
8115000	8116000	All right.
8116000	8117000	That could be bad.
8117000	8119000	I think I have an extra zero.
8119000	8120000	Sorry.
8120000	8122000	This half of the screen is black.
8122000	8123000	This half of the screen is white.
8123000	8125000	Oh, wait, they switched.
8125000	8127000	Something's happening.
8127000	8130000	All right, it is stricken from the list.
8130000	8131000	So here we go.
8131000	8133000	This is what I'm going to post into chat.
8133000	8137000	You're going to send a private message to Sky in chat if you're listening live.
8137000	8144000	Type slash MSG space SKIE space your number one and number two answers.
8144000	8145000	We will tally them up.
8145000	8146000	Here we go.
8146000	8151000	Marble Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, Working 5200 controllers,
8151000	8159000	Remake ET is a PSNX BLA game, Sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming,
8159000	8163000	More Tempest 2000 or Combat the MMO.
8163000	8164000	There it is.
8164000	8168000	We're going to tally up your votes and we will read the answers a little later in the show.
8168000	8174000	First, let me read some of the answers that the chatters came up with here.
8174000	8179000	Frisbee says bring back those sword quest games with the contest they had in them.
8179000	8180000	That was epic stuff.
8180000	8185000	I was debating suggesting a finally put out the last two Earth Quest, Water Quest, Fire Quest games.
8185000	8188000	Because they only put out the first two and then the system went under.
8188000	8195000	The third is available on some of the retro collections like on the iPhone one as like a retro or a prototype type thing.
8195000	8198000	So you can play the third one but the fourth one doesn't exist.
8198000	8199000	For real.
8199000	8200000	So let's see.
8200000	8204000	Moving on.
8204000	8205000	Let's see.
8205000	8208000	Tiger Claw says remake Pac-Man 2600 with better graphics.
8208000	8213000	Well that would be Pac-Man.
8213000	8223000	Legend of Zaku says ET remake with new super secret level where ET and Elliot recover the surplus codes or surplus copies from the New Mexico landfill where they lie today.
8223000	8224000	That's a good answer.
8224000	8228000	Better yet, the cartridges come back as zombies.
8228000	8231000	They rise from the grave.
8231000	8233000	Rise from your grave.
8233000	8237000	ET kill.
8237000	8239000	Hey, here's a bit of trivia for you.
8239000	8240000	What?
8240000	8243000	ET's design was based off of a hairless, earless cat.
8243000	8244000	Really?
8244000	8245000	Yes, really.
8245000	8254000	I remember back in the day watching an HBO special with my mother and they showed how the sketches of a cat and then it was naked and everything.
8254000	8258000	Well it does explain how he had so much control over Elliot then.
8258000	8261000	Although I don't remember him coughing up any hairballs.
8261000	8262000	Because he was naked.
8262000	8264000	He didn't lick himself.
8264000	8266000	But he could have licked other people.
8266000	8267000	Alright.
8267000	8270000	Let's get back into the news.
8270000	8273000	Dark Soccer, I think we left off with one of your stories.
8273000	8274000	You did? I forgot.
8274000	8275000	Yeah.
8275000	8276000	How about something about Yu Suzuki?
8276000	8277000	Okay, sure.
8277000	8281000	He's announced a smartphone game called Gan Gan Pirates.
8281000	8282000	Yay.
8282000	8289000	It's a pirate themed arcade style shoot-em-up that is also competitive and cooperative multiplayer.
8289000	8291000	And it will be free to play.
8291000	8295000	Launches in Japan for iOS and Android in September.
8295000	8298000	And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and get it over here too.
8298000	8302000	But nothing quite yet.
8302000	8303000	Who knows?
8303000	8304000	Gan Gan Pirates.
8304000	8305000	Is this a game you want to play?
8305000	8308000	If it's Yu Suzuki, heck yeah.
8308000	8312000	You know I have a photo of him and my husband.
8312000	8314000	Yes, you have that up on your wall very proudly.
8314000	8315000	Yes.
8315000	8316000	Good times.
8316000	8317000	Loki?
8317000	8323000	So EA's come out making bold claims and I don't know.
8323000	8325000	They keep coming out.
8325000	8331000	Listen, if you're a company that's kind of the number two company right now as far as
8331000	8337000	digital distribution goes, stop dogging on number one because, you know, going out there
8337000	8339000	and saying, hey, we're gonna be better than Steam.
8339000	8342000	We're gonna do things Steam doesn't do.
8342000	8344000	Like, not put things on sale.
8344000	8346000	How you like that shit?
8346000	8349000	I mean, it's come out sounding stupid.
8349000	8352000	We're gonna take everything that makes Steam successful and not do it and we're gonna kick
8352000	8353000	their ass.
8353000	8356000	Fourth of July sale on Steam this week.
8356000	8357000	Just saying.
8357000	8358000	Let's pray.
8358000	8359000	Prayer circle.
8359000	8360000	Did it really start?
8360000	8361000	I know it hasn't started yet.
8361000	8366000	Let's form a prayer circle, everybody, for a kickass Steam sale.
8366000	8369000	Actually, maybe that shouldn't happen because I'll end up spending a hundred dollars on
8369000	8370000	a game.
8370000	8372000	I thought the prayer circle was gonna be that they don't have a kickass sale so that
8372000	8374000	we don't waste all of our money on it.
8374000	8375000	Yeah, that's true.
8375000	8376000	That's true.
8376000	8377000	But anyways, so yeah.
8377000	8379000	They've basically said they want to be the Facebook of digital distribution compared
8379000	8384000	to Valve's MySpace.
8384000	8385000	First off...
8385000	8386000	That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
8386000	8388000	Yeah, it is the stupidest thing ever.
8388000	8390000	They're basically...
8390000	8391000	It's not gonna fucking happen, okay?
8391000	8399000	You're gonna talk all this shit but no one is gonna fucking go to Origin over Steam.
8399000	8402000	I mean, granted, you're saying, oh, hey, look.
8402000	8407000	You know, look at how well Origin's doing because all these people are signed up on
8407000	8408000	it.
8408000	8410000	And all your fucking EA games require it.
8410000	8413000	Even the ones that aren't even on PC.
8413000	8416000	You have to have a fucking Origin login.
8416000	8422000	So, yeah, you have a lot more users or people that are signed up.
8422000	8423000	It doesn't mean they're fucking buying things up.
8423000	8427000	Well, to be fair, Valve did the same shit and we all let it slip by.
8427000	8431000	Yes, but how many games does Valve release versus how many games EA releases?
8431000	8434000	Valve games are like once in a decade.
8434000	8436000	I don't know.
8436000	8437000	It's a fucking event.
8437000	8438000	Yes, exactly.
8438000	8442000	Yeah, because when Valve did it with Half-Life 2, no one knew what the fuck Steam was and
8442000	8443000	people were pissed about it.
8443000	8447000	But we've all forgiven them because they're Valve.
8447000	8452000	And Steam, of course, took a couple years to become fucking awesome, so Origin is still
8452000	8453000	a turd.
8453000	8458000	Yeah, but it's the turd that I'm hoping puts Mass Effect 3 on sale Tuesday.
8458000	8461000	Okay, so let me quote what they said here.
8461000	8463000	EA is really in an interesting place.
8463000	8471000	We have this bar that is set so high so that whether it is any of our games or services,
8471000	8474000	we want to be 90 plus Metacritic at everything.
8474000	8476000	Origin is moving in that direction.
8476000	8477000	We are not there yet.
8477000	8480000	We understand that, but we're going to get there soon.
8480000	8486000	Then fucking stop talking shit like your top dog and said, you know, eat your humble pie.
8486000	8492000	And also, another thing, maybe you shouldn't start comparing yourself to Facebook because
8492000	8494000	people don't fucking like Facebook.
8494000	8500000	I mean, granted, people really don't like MySpace, but Facebook, it's not exactly favorable.
8500000	8501000	So what are you going to do?
8501000	8508000	MySpace is getting into that I love the 90s type of thing, or better yet, I love the 70s
8508000	8512000	or something where it's like, oh, remember when everybody had a pet rock?
8512000	8516000	I'm not exactly going to go out and buy a pet rock, but I look back on it with fond
8516000	8517000	memories.
8517000	8521000	Remember when people used to post blingies on your profile and they were funny?
8521000	8522000	That's MySpace.
8522000	8524000	That was never attractive, Rob.
8524000	8525000	That was never attractive.
8525000	8526000	It was always hilarious.
8526000	8533000	But seriously, what are they going to start doing on Origin?
8533000	8539000	Are they going to start adding these at origin.com email addresses and stuff like that without
8539000	8545000	telling you and making those public so people can message you without you knowing them?
8545000	8550000	Are they going to start throwing out your phone number to everybody?
8550000	8555000	I mean, Facebook's kind of being known lately with changing things when you don't want them,
8555000	8562000	or changing things that don't need to be changed, like not throwing sales, and also for leaking
8562000	8566000	your personal information out there when you really don't want it.
8566000	8572000	So, maybe you should consider not comparing yourself to that.
8572000	8577000	And then also not comparing yourself to the top provider of anything until you become
8577000	8580000	the top provider of that.
8580000	8581000	Just saying.
8581000	8582000	Just saying.
8582000	8587000	I mean, obviously, yes, we aim to be better than our competition.
8587000	8588000	Cool.
8588000	8592000	But don't talk so much shit until you have something to back it up with.
8592000	8594000	All right.
8594000	8599000	Before we get into the listless results and the mailbag tonight, let's get into one more
8599000	8602000	story here about Blizzard, because they make some pretty popular PC games.
8602000	8606000	I don't know if you've ever heard of Diablo, but that is kind of a big deal.
8606000	8607000	Or World of Warcraft.
8607000	8613000	But anyhow, Blizzard has told us about what games will be coming to Gamescom 2012.
8613000	8618000	Mists of Pandaria will have its opening cinematic debuted, and there will be a hands-on demo
8618000	8619000	there.
8619000	8623000	Also, multiplayer for StarCraft II Heart of the Swarm.
8623000	8629000	Also, Diablo III will still be there in full display and all that, but they're not really
8629000	8632000	announcing anything with Diablo III.
8632000	8638000	The other thing I want to say is that Gamescom 2012 is August 16th through 19th.
8638000	8644000	A lot of people theorizing that Mists of Pandaria's release date clearly will not be before that,
8644000	8648000	but probably won't be long after that, because if they were debuting the cinematic, then,
8648000	8651000	well, shit, the game's not out, obviously, before that.
8651000	8655000	So a lot of people are theorizing at this point late September for the Mists of Pandaria
8655000	8657000	expansion.
8657000	8662000	So it wasn't a full year of having to raid Dragon Soul, but pretty fucking close.
8662000	8664000	Just saying.
8664000	8667000	Anyhow, let's open the mailbag.
8667000	8673000	Every week, we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
8673000	8677000	And DarkSakura dives in the mailbag headfirst, pick a few of her favorite emails, and reads
8677000	8680000	them for you live on air.
8680000	8682000	Eh.
8682000	8683000	Okay.
8683000	8687000	First email.
8687000	8688000	Howdy.
8688000	8691000	First of all, a belated congratulations on your 10-year anniversary.
8691000	8694000	It's not a late congratulations.
8694000	8697000	One year, I got a card for my birthday, which is in August, when I visited my grandparents
8697000	8698000	for Christmas.
8698000	8700000	That is late.
8700000	8704000	Anyway, like many lemmings, I've been following the news of Microsoft Surface announcement.
8704000	8707000	At first, I didn't think much of this announcement, then it dawned on me.
8707000	8712000	If pulled off correctly, Microsoft Surface can do what tablets, netbooks, and the iPad
8712000	8713000	have been able to do.
8713000	8715000	Bring PC titles to the portable market.
8715000	8719000	Now, I'm not talking about the latest and greatest titles, but games from several years
8719000	8721000	ago that people can still appreciate.
8721000	8725000	Hell, if they could get a good version of The Sims or while working on the thing, Microsoft
8725000	8726000	Surface can take off.
8726000	8728000	Stay black, Retertainment, Garris.
8728000	8731000	Sent from my iPad.
8731000	8735000	So clearly, he's interested in the Surface if he sent it from his iPad.
8735000	8738000	Unless that was a joke, I don't know.
8738000	8742000	The Surface, the press conference was a little bit of a letdown.
8742000	8744000	I think we were expecting something bigger.
8744000	8748000	For me, I have one of the new iPads now, so I'm not really interested in the tablet for
8748000	8749000	another three years at least.
8749000	8752000	They do some interesting things with it, that's for sure.
8752000	8757000	And I mean, if I was going to buy a tablet, I would probably get one of those.
8757000	8762000	But at the same time, I think they're going to be pretty expensive since they haven't
8762000	8764000	announced price or dates yet.
8764000	8767000	Although, that new Google tablet does look pretty nice.
8767000	8769000	Yeah, I was hearing about that too.
8769000	8771000	But I'm tableted out.
8771000	8777000	Well, we actually were looking at the Nexus because Dan got the phone and he loves it.
8777000	8779000	So we're sort of thinking about that tablet.
8779000	8785000	But anyway, so the next email comes from RDGSinge.
8785000	8788000	So small news for those into Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.
8788000	8793000	A recent fan-made patch was released that removes a set of in-game rules called laws
8793000	8796000	allowing the player to play in more inventive ways.
8796000	8800000	And you can find an article on that on romhacking.net.
8800000	8802000	Okay, cool.
8802000	8804000	Next email.
8804000	8807000	Hey, OLR, this is Blade3 AKA The Honey Badger.
8807000	8809000	What, because you don't give a fuck?
8809000	8814000	I just wanted to say congratulations on your 10th anniversary and so sorry I cannot participate live.
8814000	8818000	Also, I was chatting through Steam with Nick Crafter from Video Game Show, another show
8818000	8820000	syndicated by All Games.
8820000	8823000	I told him about VoG and how I wanted him to get in contact with you guys because
8823000	8828000	VGS is a great show and I told him it would be cool to see another great show featured on VoG.
8828000	8832000	So I told him I would contact you guys to help expedite the process.
8832000	8836000	I hope you would consider their show for your network and if so, thanks very much.
8836000	8843000	You guys show kicks ass along with the entire VoG network.
8843000	8848000	Although we appreciate the referrals and so forth and we do think if you know of a great show
8848000	8852000	that ought to be on the VoG network, you should let us know.
8852000	8856000	Do remember that, and I'm putting this out there as a generality for everything,
8856000	8860000	not specifically this email, but this email triggered a little thing in my head like,
8860000	8862000	oh, I need to say that on the show at some point.
8862000	8867000	Do remember the only people authorized to speak on behalf of the VoG network
8867000	8873000	are the hosts of this show, Bobby Black Wolf Show, and sometimes hosts of other shows
8873000	8876000	depending on the network already, depending on what the topic is.
8876000	8881000	But if you really want to talk to somebody in charge, you need to talk to one of us or Bobby.
8881000	8887000	So just putting that out there because I don't ever, ever, ever want somebody to promise something
8887000	8890000	on behalf of VoG we can't deliver on.
8890000	8892000	I just want to make that very clear.
8892000	8901000	I'm not saying no in this case, but I can say we are looking for more stuff than just video games.
8901000	8907000	Although I am familiar with this show and it's a pretty kick ass show and I'd be happy to work with them in some capacity.
8907000	8915000	But we'd definitely like more shows on like, you know, comic books, movies, other nerd culture things,
8915000	8921000	especially like particular series and things like that, other parts of fandom would be great
8921000	8924000	because we are really trying to expand the geek network.
8924000	8930000	Okay. PS, I have been listening since 2004 when I got my first iPod, the iPod mini.
8930000	8936000	I have grown up on your show as I was only 10 years old when I began listening and I am now 18.
8936000	8940000	Thanks for everything. I cannot tell you what it would be like without your show.
8940000	8941000	Aww.
8941000	8943000	Aww, that's very sweet.
8943000	8947000	I feel kind of old, kind of.
8947000	8949000	Okay, last email.
8949000	8954000	Hello, OLR Crew. Some random questions and topics of interest for you.
8954000	8959000	Number one, a few weeks back Dark Sakura brought up Hatsune Miku Project Diva for Vita,
8959000	8961000	making an appearance at this year's E3 convention.
8961000	8967000	Few websites had mentioned a Sega rep state of the game could be localized if there was an interest.
8967000	8970000	I tried to contact Sega's community folks but got no response.
8970000	8975000	What do you think could be done to get Sega's attention on bringing Project Diva over here?
8975000	8982000	Hit them on Twitter, hit them on Facebook, hit them through the forums, get other people to do it too,
8982000	8987000	and why not make a stupid online petition? I don't know.
8987000	8995000	But I mean, get enough people to say something to them. Start a Facebook community.
8995000	8998000	Get out there and pick it with signs.
8998000	8999000	Yeah.
8999000	9007000	Facebook is a pretty decent way to be visible in this day and age, and that's not a bad idea.
9007000	9011000	Because that also gives them numbers, which they can then take back to management and say,
9011000	9019000	look, 15,000 people want this game, and that'll help. Anyhow.
9021000	9022000	Next email?
9022000	9027000	Next email is from, no, not next email, there's more to this email.
9027000	9031000	There were more questions, Rob, jumping to conclusions.
9031000	9033000	For shame, for shame.
9033000	9037000	What is everyone's thoughts on Microsoft Surface? I have no thoughts on this.
9037000	9040000	Oh, didn't we just talk about that a little bit?
9040000	9042000	We did, so we can move on.
9042000	9043000	Defer to the prior conversation.
9043000	9044000	Okay, Sky.
9044000	9045000	Uh-oh.
9045000	9052000	Since you express interest in first-party shooters, do give Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 a try on PC.
9052000	9057000	Age of Team Fortress 2's nine classes have play styles that don't always rely on having pinpoint accuracy.
9057000	9061000	On the other hand, Left 4 Dead 2 should help you improve your aim a bit.
9061000	9065000	I have played a little bit of Left 4 Dead 1, and it was fun.
9065000	9070000	Alan and I played that a little bit, right Alan? And we had some good times with that. Left 4 Dead.
9070000	9073000	I was really, really bad at it. It was kind of fun.
9073000	9078000	Have a good evening and may a visit to Pinkberry be in your futures, and that comes from the Nasty Canasta.
9078000	9082000	P.S., Garris, and Tali, too.
9082000	9085000	And there are no more emails.
9085000	9093000	Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us another email for a future week.
9093000	9097000	Alright, let's do a few more stories. Oh, no, the FUs of the week.
9097000	9099000	We gotta get our angst out.
9099000	9101000	It's time to get ranty.
9101000	9103000	Why? Because we can.
9103000	9119000	Music
9119000	9126000	FU'd a gluten for making me freaking sick all day yesterday, to where I couldn't even leave the house.
9126000	9129000	I bet the pizza was so good.
9129000	9131000	Alan.
9131000	9139000	So once my new job starts and I'm fully trained and I'm actually allowed to do it by myself, it's like super late night shift depending on how shitty things are.
9139000	9147000	So won't be able to leave work until possibly 11 or midnight, which means I'm going to have to get a car at some point.
9147000	9151000	Someone's not going to pick my ass up all the time that late when they have a morning job.
9151000	9157000	So I guess FU'd a the reality that I might have to have a car and a license by the end of the year.
9157000	9159000	You should get a Vespa.
9159000	9163000	And yes, I know that I'm nearly 34 with no license in a car and there's a very long history behind it.
9163000	9168000	Like my family never had a car growing up and I just thought that it's expensive and scary and shitty.
9168000	9170000	Now I finally have to do it.
9170000	9174000	Well, like I told you before, my mom had a lot of the same thoughts you did.
9174000	9179000	And she didn't end up getting a license until she was 37 and pretty much had to.
9179000	9182000	But she takes back roads everywhere. She doesn't have to touch the freeway.
9182000	9189000	Growing up in the East Bay and on the peninsula of San Francisco, the transit is a joke compared to New York.
9189000	9194000	But it was good enough that I made it work. Up here in Sacramento, transit sucks.
9194000	9198000	Alright, Loki.
9198000	9203000	Fuck you to the sudden bursting water pipe that we had at our house.
9203000	9208000	Thankfully we caught it right when it happened, so there wasn't any damage.
9208000	9217000	But still, the whole process is fucking annoying. We had a giant dehumidifier, which is the size of a small fridge.
9217000	9220000	And it sounds like a loud can opener.
9220000	9224000	I was reading about that on Nellie's Facebook and yours. Sorry that happened to you guys.
9224000	9227000	No, at least we were home because she was about to leave.
9227000	9233000	And I had talked to some people that they were not home when that happened and that was not fun.
9233000	9241000	Alright, let's see. My FU of the Week goes to the fact, this is easy, the fact that I was sick on my birthday.
9241000	9246000	That's right. I don't know how, but I caught some type of sinus-y infection thingy.
9246000	9250000	You might hear it in my voice still, actually. I sound a little different tonight.
9250000	9253000	I've been trying to kick this for about a week, which included on my birthday.
9253000	9256000	So thank you, Mother Nature, for that little present. Really appreciate it.
9256000	9260000	Speaking of presents, just to let you know, I've got presents coming for both of you.
9260000	9263000	I have to finish making them.
9263000	9264000	Very cool.
9264000	9267000	But there are presents coming and they are for you both.
9267000	9268000	Aww, yay.
9268000	9271000	The next O.L.R. is going to be on my birthday.
9271000	9274000	Oh my god. Oh shit, that means I can't do it, huh?
9274000	9277000	No, we don't have to do anything out for my birthday.
9277000	9279000	We'll figure something out. We'll do it before or after.
9279000	9281000	But I'll have to bring it then.
9281000	9284000	You'll probably have to work anyway. Oh wait, no, maybe not on the 8th.
9284000	9285000	Yeah.
9285000	9289000	Oh well, we'll figure something out. We'll throw a party on air just for you.
9289000	9291000	Maybe you'll have to come right back next week.
9291000	9295000	Wicked says F you to being bad at cataheroics.
9295000	9302000	And I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been so mercenary in saying how could anyone die on Benedictus.
9302000	9306000	Because I have been in a failed party that died on Benedictus.
9306000	9310000	Not through anything I did, through everybody else sucking.
9312000	9314000	Only the well players know what I'm talking about.
9314000	9318000	Just make sure you don't stand in stuff and dodge the waves. Be aware.
9318000	9319000	I have an F you to add.
9319000	9320000	What?
9320000	9323000	To the um, to the add on GTFO for being annoying.
9323000	9327000	Me! You're standing as shit. Me!
9327000	9329000	You need to tell it to GTFO.
9329000	9332000	I thought it would help and it just was annoying.
9332000	9336000	Alright, let's get to the listless results.
9336000	9341000	You've all been dying to hear it. What is the definitive answer, kids, to the list?
9341000	9348000	Thing that Atari 2600, or excuse me, Atari in general, could do to be relevant like they were in the 2600 days.
9348000	9352000	How could a 40 year old company be as relevant as they were in 1982?
9352000	9354000	Here it is, the top three answers.
9354000	9358000	As mentioned, nominated by the host and voted on by chat.
9358000	9360000	Number three.
9360000	9362000	Number three answer is.
9362000	9367000	Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.
9367000	9368000	Yay!
9368000	9370000	Y'all are pervs.
9370000	9372000	Number three answer.
9372000	9374000	The number two answer tonight.
9374000	9376000	Marble Madness 2.
9376000	9378000	That's the game people want.
9378000	9380000	That's definitely a game people want.
9380000	9382000	And the number one answer.
9382000	9384000	What do you most want?
9384000	9388000	A sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim.
9388000	9392000	That is what will save Atari's ass.
9392000	9395000	And I still say it could be a launch title for the Atari 1090.
9395000	9396000	I do.
9396000	9397000	So there it is.
9397000	9399000	Your top three answers.
9399000	9401000	Thanks for playing.
9401000	9403000	Here's a lifetime supply of turtle wax.
9403000	9405000	Alright, let's move on.
9405000	9408000	And Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco Treat.
9408000	9413000	The other thing they could do that would be kind of funny is like an arcade game that's basically an Atari 2600.
9413000	9417000	But you know how they have that giant Tetris machine with the controller that's really huge?
9417000	9419000	You do one even better.
9419000	9422000	My god, I played that at Golf Land like a week or two ago.
9422000	9423000	I think it was scary.
9423000	9429000	The Atari 2600 controller is really simple. It's just a giant button and basically a giant joystick.
9429000	9435000	So you have this giant foam joystick that you can kind of swing on or whatever in a giant button.
9435000	9439000	So you play 2600 games on a giant screen with the giant controller.
9439000	9441000	It would be funny.
9441000	9445000	A giant 2600. That would be great, actually.
9445000	9447000	Hilarious.
9447000	9457000	Alright, so we talked a little bit about the Wii U and of course there's all different companies promising to bring various games to the platform.
9457000	9464000	One of which is actually, well, they do have a game coming to the Wii U at launch.
9464000	9471000	Their Ninja Gaiden 3 is getting a port, but Team Ninja is also thinking about Dead or Alive 5 for the Wii U.
9471000	9475000	And that makes sense because if you think about it, you know, they're doing Ninja Gaiden 3.
9475000	9485000	There's already Tekken Tag Tournament 2, so it wouldn't be that difficult to port a game over, I think, from the PlayStation 3 or 360 to the Wii U.
9485000	9492000	And they're saying right now we're doing our best to get ready for PlayStation 3 and 360 for the version of Dead or Alive 5.
9492000	9501000	But we want to hear what players think about the Wii U version or if they'd be interested in it.
9501000	9511000	So, I could see that happening, especially with a Game of the Year edition or something like that. They could do it.
9511000	9516000	That could be pretty awesome, actually. You know, because it's a fun series.
9516000	9521000	It's always hilarious in this day and age to see very adult games on a Nintendo platform.
9521000	9525000	I'd be curious what the tablet would be for. How about Boob Cam?
9525000	9527000	Well, they do have photo mode.
9527000	9528000	Do they?
9528000	9529000	Yes, they do.
9529000	9530000	Nice.
9530000	9538000	And remember, not only do they have photo mode, but I believe this game had transparent clothing.
9538000	9547000	Like, you could actually get, like, water or something like that on different parts of the clothing and it would be, you know, the correct transparency and stuff like that.
9547000	9554000	Or, um, maybe it was ripping clothing. Something to the effect of you see more boobies.
9554000	9561000	Do you think Team Ninja would feel burned at all over the reception over Metroid Other M or do you think it's kind of like, eh, you know?
9561000	9569000	I think if anything, they're going to be more burned at the fact that Ninja Gaiden 3 sucks and that, you know, it's going to be launched out for the Wii U and people won't give a shit.
9569000	9570000	Aw.
9570000	9576000	Sorry. Unless they go back and fix the game, I don't think people are going to give a shit.
9576000	9588000	Alright. One more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to add us on Skype.
9588000	9593000	Do remember, we appreciate if you check Echo 1-2-3 first before using Skype.
9593000	9602000	But you can also, and, you know, think outside the box, you can also use Skype on a Vita, you can use Skype on an iOS device or I'm pretty sure Android has it too.
9602000	9607000	Many ways you can install Skype and call the show or you can just pick up a damn telephone.
9607000	9610000	If you still have one of those telephones on your wall with a rotary dial, it will work.
9610000	9615000	1-877-GAME-OLR. You just will probably have to dial a lot.
9615000	9616000	So get your finger ready.
9616000	9621000	But first, one more story and this has to do with Retro City Rampage.
9621000	9624000	Some folks looking forward to this game because it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.
9624000	9625000	God, when the hell is that coming out?
9625000	9627000	If it was on the NES.
9627000	9634000	No answer, but what I can tell you, it's going to support cross-play on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
9634000	9641000	So, meaning if you buy it on one platform, you get it on the other and you can play across the two.
9641000	9646000	Well, do you get it on the other or do you have to buy both and then you can play?
9646000	9649000	Nope, you get one and you unlock the other.
9649000	9650000	Sweet!
9650000	9651000	That's awesome.
9651000	9652000	One payment, both versions.
9652000	9653000	Hooray!
9653000	9654000	I know, I will be getting it for the Vita.
9654000	9659000	As reported by IndieGames.com, it's the pay once, cross-play deal.
9659000	9663000	Said by, who is this guy?
9663000	9666000	Martin Turton, who's with Clever Beans, putting this game out.
9666000	9672000	Quote, we think that the appeal of the buy once deal, which should hopefully attract more people to buy the game,
9672000	9677000	far outweighs any extra sales we might get from people who are prepared to buy the game twice.
9677000	9683000	Especially considering that require two separate purchases would be likely to cause a fair backlash.
9683000	9687000	Basically, we want to price the game in a way that would attract us to buy it ourselves.
9687000	9689000	Very interesting tactic.
9689000	9692000	They're basically saying, you know what, yeah, we could double dip people.
9692000	9698000	But if we don't and we make it free, it's going to attract more people to the game because it's like, hey, free game.
9698000	9708000	Well, I was originally going to get it on 360, although I might still buy it on PlayStation Network and 360 because it could be fun.
9708000	9709000	I don't know, we'll see.
9709000	9710000	Start with the Vita.
9710000	9711000	So that's pretty cool.
9711000	9714000	So good job on you, Retro City Rampage.
9714000	9716000	Some good news to end with tonight.
9716000	9718000	We're going to open up Skype line.
9718000	9719000	It's open.
9719000	9720000	If you want to call, do it now.
9720000	9730000	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9730000	9732000	I'm logging into Twitter right now.
9732000	9733000	I was on the wrong Twitter.
9733000	9735000	I was on my personal Twitter.
9735000	9740000	And I saw a message that caught my eye that I'm just going to have to read it later because I'm trying to do a show.
9740000	9744000	Yeah, Rob, on your Twitter as I check my Facebook.
9744000	9746000	Let's go to some tweets while we wait for calls.
9746000	9747000	Again, Skype line is open.
9747000	9751000	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9751000	9757000	YYR says, ask Dark Tetsuya.
9757000	9759000	That's the person right below.
9759000	9760000	That's not me.
9760000	9769000	Ask Dark Sakura to give Fernando, the main character in Bungee Ferret Tossing or BFD, a last name.
9769000	9771000	He's French Canadian.
9771000	9773000	And then get back to me.
9773000	9776000	Well, shit, this could have been the list list tonight, but oops.
9776000	9780000	Fernando needs a last name.
9780000	9781000	He is French Canadian.
9781000	9783000	Cocteau.
9783000	9787000	I was going to say an amalgamation of Celine Dion.
9787000	9789000	She's French Canadian.
9789000	9791000	Fernando Celine Dion?
9791000	9794000	Fernando C. Dion.
9794000	9796000	Alright, never mind.
9796000	9797000	That's stupid.
9797000	9801000	Yeah, that is.
9801000	9805000	I was trying to think of a way to make it work like Cécile Dion.
9805000	9807000	You think about that Dark Sakura while I take this call.
9807000	9808000	Poisson.
9808000	9809000	Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.
9809000	9810000	No, I thought of it. Poisson.
9810000	9811000	I'm taking a call.
9811000	9812000	Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.
9812000	9814000	Who's this?
9814000	9815000	Hey, what's up?
9815000	9818000	This is John, aka Wicked, from the Nerdgasm Network.
9818000	9822000	What is up, John, aka Wicked, from the Nerdgasm Network?
9822000	9825000	Indie podcast, holla.
9825000	9827000	What's up, Robert?
9827000	9829000	What's up?
9829000	9836000	This is the first time I've actually been on the live stream, in the chat, listening to the show live, but I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now.
9836000	9841000	Awesome. Well, thank you for joining us live, and I'm happy we could pop your Skype cherry tonight.
9841000	9848000	Definitely. I meant to come in last week, but, you know, wow, don't you say anything.
9848000	9853000	It was kind of a pain in the ass to get through last week, so it's a lot clearer tonight.
9853000	9867000	Definitely. I just wanted to say hi to everybody there, and just kind of slightly promote Nerdgasm Network a little bit, but I do have a little bit of discussion. It's not shameless self-promotion completely.
9867000	9871000	All right. Okay, first discussion, then shameless self-promotion.
9871000	9880000	Gotcha. There were some talks with the Wii U earlier, and I mentioned this inside the chat, and I kind of want to get your guys' opinion on this.
9880000	9881000	Yeah.
9881000	9898000	But it seems like Nintendo's not really kind of learning from their old mistakes, because the Wii kind of came out before the 360 and the PS3, I believe, and you can obviously tell by comparison that the Wii is not the strongest graphically of the three systems.
9898000	9914000	And sadly, it seems like the Wii U is going to come out again, and while it's going to be superior to the 360 and the PS3 as far as graphics and check and everything, it's still going to vastly be inferior to, you know, whatever the Microsoft Sony platform is going to be.
9914000	9928000	I'm just wondering, do you think Nintendo should have even, like, brought this out now, or do you think they probably should have waited a year and tried to equalize it? I mean, do they understand that they're going to, you know, that they're essentially going to repeat the path?
9928000	9939000	Here's the thing, and, you know, in theory, what you're saying, it sounds good, and to me, as somebody who's been gaming for many, many years, it makes a lot of sense, and I always want the best technology and all that.
9939000	9953000	However, there's one big flaw, and that is the Wii sold fuck tons. Far after the 360 and the PS3 came out, the Wii was still selling fuck tons, even though it wasn't the most powerful system.
9953000	9975000	And so I think Nintendo would be happy as shit to sell even three quarters of the amount of Wii U as they sold the Wii. However, I will say this, one thing, if they don't prepare well enough for the future, the theory that you do have here is right, in that the technology will lose steam and it will lose steam fast.
9975000	9987000	That's the problem, is that the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, they're continuing to sell in some ways Sony better than ever, but Nintendo, they fell down the shitter in the past year.
9987000	9996000	But the only problem is that this new generation of systems, or at least this new Nintendo system, isn't that, it's not very different from the Wii.
9996000	10004000	See, before, with the Wii, there wasn't a system out like that. It was completely new. These motion controls were completely unique to it, and it was a unique experience.
10004000	10014000	The Wii U with an extra tablet controller, people are familiar with tablets. I don't think they're going to give a shit that it's slightly better graphics and it has a tablet controller on it.
10014000	10030000	They're going to be like, why do I need this? I can buy a Wii. And honestly, they can. They can buy a Wii and New Super Mario Brothers and they have pretty much the same offering as New Super Mario Brothers U and a Wii U, except they don't have the extra tablet controller and the graphics aren't slightly prettier, I guess.
10030000	10042000	I guess at the end of the day, it also comes down to how badly do soccer moms across America want a sequel to New Super Mario Brothers Wii, because it's about the most exciting original IP that Nintendo unveiled for that thing.
10042000	10050000	And it's not even that original, but it's a successful formula. That's what this is all about.
10050000	10063000	And sadly, I think software might end up playing a big issue, especially, I mean, it's Nintendo, so obviously third-party software is going to be a big issue, especially because when they first originally announced the Wii U, one of the big titles they were toting was Batman Arkham City.
10063000	10068000	And the thing is, that's already been out for about a year, and the Wii U still isn't even out yet.
10068000	10076000	So are they still really going to be toting a two-year-old, essentially, when the release is probably a two-year-old game, as like a flagship bearer?
10076000	10081000	Sadly, if E3 is any indication, yes. But it's got a cool new mechanism.
10081000	10092000	But I don't think that's necessarily a big game for them, because, I mean, yeah, it's cool that they have Batman Arkham City, but there's plenty of other games that are coming out around the same time, like Assassin's Creed 3, which will be pretty big.
10092000	10102000	And then they've got a lot of exclusives for the system as well. But yeah, it's kind of stupid that they're going to have all these games that have been out for months or years before it comes out, like Ninja Gaiden 3.
10102000	10111000	Darksiders 2, to a lesser extent, because that's only coming out a few months before, but it's still something that's going to have been out for a while.
10111000	10113000	Not even Mass Effect is getting me that excited.
10113000	10120000	Yes, Mass Effect 3 is like, seriously, I mean, that's just, it seems like easy money.
10120000	10124000	Unless I can finally romance some of the characters I've been wanting to romance, like that.
10124000	10125000	Me too.
10125000	10128000	That's just, it's my secret.
10128000	10129000	Mm-hmm!
10129000	10130000	I can see him doing good.
10130000	10134000	I can see him doing like a Game of the Year edition with Mass Effect, although that would be pretty quick.
10134000	10136000	She is a bit of a cougar, isn't she?
10136000	10146000	Exactly. Alright, self-promotion time, so we can wrap up and get more calls, but self-promotion. We like to support indie podcasts, so please, plug away.
10146000	10161000	Alright, I've got three podcasts I want to plug. Obviously, my home at NergasmNetwork.com. We've got great discussions going on, we've got a video game podcast that I co-host with Ryan, Josh, Patrick, a few other people.
10161000	10176000	They also have a new movie podcast, where it's kind of like a riff-track, where they watch a movie and they kind of discuss, like, they kind of poke fun at it, but they also kind of discuss, you know, the cinematography and all the other stuff.
10176000	10178000	That's a great idea.
10178000	10188000	That's a great, you know, and I've heard other people kind of talking about that sort of thing, like a, I don't want to call it a riff-tracks podcast, but that's kind of what heavily inspires it sort of thing, to play along with the movie.
10188000	10194000	I'm glad somebody is doing it, and not just talking about it. It's great.
10194000	10202000	Yeah, we're just having issues with the YouTube channel, because that's where we're uploading the films plus the commentary, and we're getting some issues with that.
10202000	10204000	But we're working on it.
10204000	10220000	But, you know, there's nothing wrong with putting just the commentary out there and say, okay, press play in three, two, one, go, you know, and you can watch the movie along, especially if its title is available on Netflix. Tons of people have Netflix. It'd be super easy.
10220000	10222000	Yeah, I'd be fun to work on it.
10222000	10231000	Also, Nergasm Network is home to the bi-weekly beer chasm, where Ryan and some more select groups review beer.
10231000	10238000	Well, my gosh, you don't just have a podcast, you have a whole freaking network over there, but that sounds, that's awesome.
10238000	10246000	Yeah, there's also a couple other shows coming down the pipeline. We've got a music podcast, there's going to be a tech, kind of an overall tech podcast coming up as well.
10246000	10252000	But yeah, nerdgasmnetwork.com, that's, like you said, indie podcast going away.
10252000	10254000	That's right.
10254000	10263000	Yeah, and I've got one more site I kind of want to pimp out. I'm sure you know these guys. Slykick and Spike, the hosts of GameBooey.org.
10263000	10267000	That's right. It's a newer show, but it's a lot of fun.
10267000	10278000	Yeah, I used to go to high school with Spike, so I'm really good friends with him. Slykick used to be a guest on my old podcast, Geeks or Fans, but that kind of closed up earlier this year.
10278000	10290000	Don't. But yeah, no, Spike and Slykick are two very, very good friends of mine, and I've been begging them to come up and be on OLR forever, so open invite, guys.
10290000	10298000	You want to come pimp your show, get your butt up here to Sacramento. It's not China, it's not that far of a foreign land.
10298000	10304000	Yeah, we'll try getting them to even get to Stockton and try to get them to come out here for like 12 years now.
10304000	10308000	All right, we'll both keep pestering them, and one of us will win eventually.
10308000	10317000	Definitely. In fact, I actually started listening to Orange Laundrio because of Hoard House because Slykick actually promoted a couple episodes he was on on Hoard House.
10317000	10321000	Indie podcast promotion, it works. It works.
10321000	10328000	Yeah, definitely. So, you know, there's two podcast sites that you guys should check out, GameBooey.org and, of course, NergasmNetwork.com.
10328000	10335000	All right, if I let you plug anymore, I'm going to have to make you pay for it. All right, have a good one, buddy. I've got to take more calls. Thank you for your call.
10335000	10338000	All right. No problem. And keep listening to OLR.
10338000	10339000	All right, will do.
10339000	10342000	By the way, I have decided on a last name thanks to Alan.
10342000	10344000	Oh, okay. Bye, take care.
10344000	10346000	Yes, you have a last name thanks to Alan.
10346000	10347000	Poutine.
10347000	10350000	Poutine. So the name will be Fernando Poutine.
10350000	10351000	Fernando Poutine.
10351000	10353000	All right, there it is. That's the name. Fernando Poutine.
10353000	10355000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundrio. Who's this?
10355000	10356000	It's Shane.
10356000	10357000	Hey, Shane, what's up?
10357000	10360000	It's me. I'm awake.
10360000	10365000	Is there anything you wanted to call to share with us tonight?
10365000	10366000	Yes.
10366000	10367000	Garris.
10367000	10370000	I want to talk about Mass Effect.
10370000	10372000	Yay, my favorite topic.
10372000	10376000	It's mine too. What a coincidence.
10376000	10377000	Yeah, that's weird.
10377000	10390000	So I'll get it out of the way. First of all, I do like the extended cut stuff, despite a lot of people hating it. And I understand their complaints, but I like all the happy and sad parts of it. So it's cool.
10390000	10410000	But I think either BioWare is really stupid and the fans are brilliant or BioWare is an evil genius because I'm finding even more people starting to subscribe to the indoctrination theory after the extended cut now.
10410000	10425000	And there's all these new things that they put in the extended cut that point to it. And it's getting ridiculous. And I'm torn because I used to believe in it. I still kind of do. But at the same time, I don't want to keep going with it.
10425000	10432000	If you want something to be true bad enough, you'll find a way to make it true in your mind. You know?
10432000	10436000	Yes, but there's videos and sound files.
10436000	10447000	Again, that's all part of they're just wishing really hard, wishing I want it to be true. Click my heels three times. There's no place like indoctrination theory. There's no place like something like that.
10447000	10450000	I don't think they would ever really say that.
10450000	10461000	I did. Okay, well, so it hasn't just been about Mass Effect this week, though, but you also have been playing Final Fantasy 11 with me. And for a change, I started playing the game first and peer pressured you into buying it.
10461000	10465000	So what did you think about the return to Final Fantasy 11?
10465000	10475000	It was a nice like homecoming sort of feeling. And I like that everything's familiar, but at the same time, they've changed it enough that it's still interesting.
10475000	10485000	So it's not just the same. Let's go to the dunes and level for four hours, but only get, you know, 50% of the way through a level because we died seven times.
10485000	10486000	Right.
10486000	10497000	That's fantastic. Like, I want to keep playing it, but then there's Mass Effect multiplayer I have to play. And that's really the only two games I'm jumping between. Wow. I don't even turn that on for the most part now.
10497000	10507000	Well, the good news is there's not a lot of other games coming out. So now's a good chance to kind of catch up on stuff like I, I still really need to play Skyrim, even though I've been hearing kind of tepid reception of the DLC.
10507000	10512000	I never did beat the frickin campaign mode in the first game. I need to go back and do that.
10512000	10524000	That's right. I started replaying that last night cause I got really bored and it was still okay, but I'm not going to download any DLC cause it's an Elder Scrolls game and they're generally awful. So I don't care.
10524000	10528000	It's hit and miss. It's hit and miss. All right. Well, anything else you want to share with us tonight, Shane?
10528000	10532000	No, cause I'm sure I'll just talk more about Mass Effect on the courthouse.
10532000	10538000	Well, like I was bugging you last night, just put the pen to paper and write out something to post on vognetwork.com.
10538000	10540000	Actually, Shane, I have to ask you a question.
10540000	10541000	I have an answer. What's up?
10541000	10546000	What do you think of my idea for an MMO for Mass Effect?
10546000	10564000	I would drop all my games to play it, but I also don't know how it would work. Like, especially with the current universe the way it is. I don't know what we would really base the MMO off of.
10564000	10571000	I see. I have to finish the third one before I can decide, but I'm sort of thinking, you know, post end game.
10571000	10574000	And then you have to figure out which endings can end then.
10574000	10578000	Prequel, prequel, prequel, prequel. You just don't know it in the same storyline.
10578000	10587000	Nobody wants a prequel because then if you do a prequel and if you set it too far back, then you'd be stuck on like earth, which would be boring.
10587000	10596000	Easy ass prequel because with the whole like Horde Alliance, you know, two faction type of thing, Turian War. You set the MMO during the Turian War.
10596000	10598000	No, that's terrible.
10598000	10599000	I disagree.
10599000	10602000	Only because you wouldn't be able to romance a Turian.
10602000	10603000	Shut up.
10603000	10605000	Unless you were a Turian.
10605000	10606000	Because it's true.
10606000	10612000	But it might be the first time we see female Turians, so that might make it worth it alone.
10612000	10617000	They were apparently in the comic and they don't, they look like horrible, so no.
10617000	10619000	That's not what female Turians look like in my head.
10619000	10623000	All right. Before this turns into the Mass Effect show, I gotta let you go, Shane.
10623000	10625000	Shane, we should do that. A Mass Effect show.
10625000	10627000	Oh, he's already pitched one to me.
10627000	10629000	Yeah, I already have.
10629000	10631000	And I say produce a pilot.
10631000	10634000	All right. All right, take care.
10634000	10635000	Bye bye.
10635000	10636000	Bye.
10636000	10641000	1877 game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.
10641000	10645000	I did tweet YYR back. Hopefully he got it.
10645000	10648000	Because you're confusing the poor guy, because you sent him something else first, I think.
10648000	10649000	Poutine. Poutine.
10649000	10650000	It is poutine.
10650000	10651000	I stick with poutine.
10651000	10653000	All right, the final answer.
10653000	10659000	Because that's a good idea, because it's kind of disgusting looking, but delicious.
10659000	10661000	Like a ferret?
10661000	10663000	Ferrets aren't delicious.
10663000	10664000	I've never had ferret.
10664000	10665000	All right, we have another call coming in. Let's take it.
10665000	10667000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
10667000	10669000	You're confused.
10669000	10671000	Sorry, this is Techie Q.
10671000	10673000	Say that again?
10673000	10675000	Sorry, this is Techie Q.
10675000	10676000	Techie Q?
10676000	10678000	Techie Q, sorry.
10678000	10681000	Techie Q, I got you. Techie Q, what's on your mind, buddy? Hi, welcome to the show.
10681000	10690000	Two things. One, congratulations on your 10 year since I didn't get to call in last week.
10690000	10694000	The phone lines were absolutely bonkers last week, but we appreciate it.
10694000	10697000	We like the fact that our birthday can last across multiple weeks.
10697000	10701000	And also, I want to gloat on the classic game of the week.
10701000	10706000	I'm one of the few people that beat Ninja Gaiden without cheating.
10706000	10709000	Well, look at you.
10709000	10712000	Hey, I know. Mad props, seriously.
10712000	10715000	I do want to shake your hand. I'm giving you a virtual handshake right now.
10715000	10717000	He really did. He held his hand up in front of the monitor.
10717000	10724000	I did. I was looking for an emote icon that I could possibly send over, but that'll have to do.
10724000	10728000	There he is. A thumbs up. I just sent him.
10728000	10732000	But, I mean, seriously, it's really damn difficult to beat that game.
10732000	10733000	It is. It is.
10733000	10735000	So anyone who has, hey, you can do this for me.
10735000	10739000	I mean, it's special like the last level. It's like an endurance run.
10739000	10743000	And isn't it just the biggest exercise in frustration?
10743000	10746000	Uh, for the first hour it is.
10746000	10749000	To get back to the three bosses you have to beat three times.
10749000	10756000	I'll put it this way. Even beating Ghosts N' Goblins isn't nearly as frustrating as Ninja Gaiden.
10756000	10758000	Let me ask you this question, TechieQ.
10758000	10762000	Do you like the new Ninja Gaiden games? Because clearly you're a fan of the old ones.
10762000	10765000	But do you think they got it right with the newer ones?
10765000	10768000	I don't like the third one. I really dumbed it down.
10768000	10772000	Nobody does. Let's be real.
10772000	10776000	Like the last Ninja Gaiden, the newer one I played was the second one.
10776000	10780000	And that one red-ringed my 360. So I'm scared to play it.
10780000	10784000	Oh my gosh. You know what red-ringed my 360?
10784000	10785000	What's that?
10785000	10786000	Joust.
10786000	10787000	Oh, wow.
10787000	10788000	Right?
10788000	10789000	Yeah, that's crazy.
10789000	10790000	That's sad.
10790000	10792000	Alright.
10792000	10794000	Well, TechieQ, congratulations.
10794000	10798000	Did you beat the classic 8-bit sequels?
10798000	10800000	What was it, the two ships and the other one?
10800000	10804000	Two, I didn't beat three. I just didn't even care anymore because it's so hard.
10804000	10805000	Yeah, yeah.
10805000	10809000	That one actually had lives and continues to mess with.
10809000	10812000	If you have a working Super Nintendo somewhere, you should look for that compilation.
10812000	10815000	It was really good. It had all three games on it.
10815000	10816000	Right.
10816000	10821000	Alright, well, TechieQ, anything else you want to share with the listeners and such tonight?
10821000	10823000	Chainsaw light pop is awesome.
10823000	10826000	Chainsaw light pop. I've been hearing some mixed things on it.
10826000	10828000	But what makes it awesome? Why do you like it?
10828000	10836000	I think it's the humor and the 80s satire that people miss out if you don't play enough of the game.
10836000	10840000	You know, that's true. Humor can go a long way because I seriously loved Saints Row the Third.
10840000	10846000	And let's be real, it's not that great of a game and it's nothing you haven't seen in stuff like Grand Theft Auto.
10846000	10849000	But the humor is what makes it a lot of fun.
10849000	10850000	Yeah.
10850000	10852000	That and the sing-along for what I've got.
10852000	10861000	I think you'd like it too, because it's got a lot of 80s satire and they did a Commodore 64 segment.
10861000	10866000	I'm going to have to check that out. And boobies, right? Is there lots of boobies?
10866000	10869000	You've got the right costume. You've got a grand fort.
10869000	10870000	There you go. Alright.
10870000	10875000	Well, TechieQ, I've got to let you go, but Lollipop Chainsaw, I'll check it out and let you know what I think in a future week.
10875000	10876000	Okay, take care.
10876000	10877000	Take care.
10877000	10878000	Alright, bye.
10878000	10883000	Alright, I'm going to have to close up the Skype line just because we're running a little long and I still got to get last minute stories and tweets.
10883000	10885000	You know what I want?
10885000	10886000	What?
10886000	10887000	Poutine.
10887000	10889000	I've had it before. It's really good.
10889000	10899000	It is really good. It is really good. If you ask really, really nicely, maybe Allen will get you a little spoon and there's some strawberry pinkberry in the freezer.
10899000	10904000	Alright, don't give her too much because I want some later.
10904000	10906000	One spoonful. No, I'm kidding.
10906000	10910000	Alright, more tweets.
10910000	10915000	Ziba tweets us saying, have you guys seen Tron Uprising, the animated series yet?
10915000	10918000	I have seen the first episode so far and it was really good.
10918000	10921000	You and I have seen the same amount of Tron Uprising.
10921000	10930000	I was going to write a further review for VOG, but then I realized that because the guy in the truck was a liar, I was behind in the episodes and I never got a chance to catch up.
10930000	10932000	So I'm going to defer that review to later.
10932000	10938000	But based on the first episode of Tron Uprising that I saw, yeah, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it.
10938000	10940000	I was going to give it a positive review.
10940000	10947000	It wasn't perfect. I felt the storyline was a little bit cliche and predictable, but it is a cartoon. Let's not be too harsh on it.
10947000	10951000	And I liked the whole dark style of it.
10951000	10958000	It was a very Batman animated series look because Batman was always a black canvas as opposed to a white canvas.
10958000	10961000	And I'm pretty sure Tron has done very similarly.
10961000	10962000	You really liked it too, right?
10962000	10965000	Yeah, I watched the first three episodes.
10965000	10971000	It was good. I've liked it so far. I still need to catch up on some of them that I missed.
10971000	10972000	Alright.
10972000	10977000	Dark Tetsuya says he's going to make good on President Kat Pong, so stay tuned.
10977000	10981000	I don't know how he's doing it, but maybe there's like a Pong maker? I don't know. We'll see.
10981000	10991000	Alright, moving on. Tigerclaw sharing a couple news tweets with us. The Google Nexus 7 is going to be available at GameStop.
10991000	10993000	That story's been making the rounds this week.
10993000	10999000	It actually doesn't surprise me too much because GameStop has been openly like, trade us your iPhone, trade us your iPad.
10999000	11007000	They want to get into that market and I think it's because they're trying, you know, as much as I am personally not a fan of GameStop,
11007000	11016000	I can appreciate that they're trying to stay a step ahead and like, oh shit, if everything goes digital distribution, our market's going to be hardware.
11016000	11023000	You know, we're going to be fucked soon. So they're trying to get their fingers in other pies so that they don't go completely out of business.
11023000	11025000	So you know what? It makes sense.
11025000	11032000	Honestly, I think it's because they're trying to get more reasons for people to trade in their stuff and some people want to trade in games to buy tablets and stuff.
11032000	11035000	And so that way they can sell more used games.
11035000	11036000	Interesting.
11036000	11043000	Because there's no markup in hardware. So, I mean, I'm not sure about consumer electronics, but I know for game hardware there's no markup.
11043000	11048000	But what I said has to be some of it, right? I mean, that they're trying to get into other stuff than just games.
11048000	11052000	They're not worried about it because of, you know, who they are.
11052000	11058000	Alright, one other tweet from Tigerclaw. This will be the last tweet and then we can go to last minute stories. I don't know even if you have any.
11058000	11064000	But the shutdown law in South Korea. We reported on this either last week or the week before.
11064000	11073000	Some folks are challenging it. NCSoft being one of them, according to this news story from gamesindustry.biz that Tigerclaw sent me on Twitter.
11073000	11079000	South Korea shutdown law has been called into question by citizens and game companies.
11079000	11081000	Two lawsuits have been filed against the law.
11081000	11089000	One is a Korean organization representing parents and children who says the law undermines parental rights to educate their children.
11089000	11097000	We need that organization here.
11097000	11105000	The second lawsuit was filed by game publishers NCSoft, Neowiz, and Nexon.
11105000	11108000	And they just argue the law itself is illegal.
11108000	11115000	The lawsuits were filed last fall and the arguments are currently being heard, etc.
11115000	11118000	So we'll get more news on that in the coming weeks.
11118000	11121000	There you go. That's it for tweets. How about last minute stories tonight, Loki?
11121000	11130000	The voice actor for Duke Nukem is bitching that some of the voice acting work in video games goes over to film actors.
11130000	11136000	And he says film actors do not need voice acting roles in video games or commercial projects.
11136000	11140000	These roles are for voice actors, not Hollywood celebrities.
11140000	11143000	And when you consider the amount of money they make for each and every film project,
11143000	11149000	it's unfair for those of us who have struggled to make ends meet in our chosen profession.
11149000	11152000	I have trained and worked hard for nearly 30 years as a voice actor.
11152000	11158000	And when film stars land a role in either game or commercial project, they earn far more than I do,
11158000	11164000	even though I am a SAG-AFTRA union member.
11164000	11168000	How is that fair? I don't appreciate them taking work from me and my fellow VAs.
11168000	11172000	Well, you know what? People aren't being drawn to games because your name's on it.
11172000	11175000	And maybe they just audition better than you do.
11175000	11184000	I really hate to say it, but I think this guy is just, I mean, the reality is, he needs to ask the question,
11184000	11189000	well, why do celebrities get in Shrek? And why are they in the Disney movies?
11189000	11195000	And why are they, you know, because unfortunately star power and the names behind it mean a lot.
11195000	11202000	And as much, it sucks because this guy does have an iconic voice in many ways.
11202000	11206000	The voice of Duke Nukem, right? Hail to the king, baby. And all that stuff, right?
11206000	11211000	Nobody knows his name. Maybe that's what needs to change.
11211000	11219000	Maybe there needs to be more recognition about who you are and then you build that star power.
11219000	11221000	I think that's the problem.
11221000	11228000	It just made me think about something, though, back to Mass Effect, how you've got Martin Sheen as the elusive man.
11228000	11233000	And modeled on him and everything, you've got all of these actors, you know, Seth Green in it.
11233000	11241000	But the main characters, well, you have main characters there, but the main character is a well-noted voice actor.
11241000	11247000	Well, I'm actually thinking of the female Shepard, who's done like fantastic roles,
11247000	11251000	and the Avengers cartoon was in X-Men and all kinds of stuff.
11251000	11257000	And you've got the talents going, and that's where they're best directed.
11257000	11262000	And I think that that's really the approach that should be taken, that everyone should be done by their merits.
11262000	11266000	What are their skills as a voice actor? Martin Sheen sounds like Martin Sheen.
11266000	11269000	He's not hiding that this is Martin Sheen playing a role.
11269000	11276000	But I doubt he'd be able to go in and be a different voice than Martin Sheen, you know what I mean?
11276000	11282000	That's my point. So I kind of agree and kind of don't.
11282000	11286000	Just saying, just saying.
11286000	11291000	All right. Well, any other last-minute stories to share tonight?
11291000	11302000	There's a new Kickstarter for a game that's, I guess, being built on the Rage Engine, and it's called Ravaged.
11302000	11306000	I guess it's supposed to be like a multiplayer-type game.
11306000	11312000	I guess Rage, you know, they were kind of promising this big multiplayer thing, and it never really happened.
11312000	11319000	So now it's this, oh, it's being based on Unreal 3, and it's going to look like Rage, though.
11319000	11323000	So Ravaged, multiplayer kind of Rage-type game.
11323000	11330000	Post-apocalyptic, car racing, gun fighting. Looks neat.
11330000	11336000	Oh, and speaking of Kickstarter, that retro, was it the retro game 101?
11336000	11338000	Yeah, you mentioned that last week. Already hit it, right?
11338000	11341000	Yeah, they already hit it. I was surprised.
11341000	11344000	Well, so Kickstarter is still working for some folks.
11344000	11345000	Yeah.
11345000	11349000	Some of us thought it would be a fad, but it's still going for some.
11349000	11355000	Yeah, speaking of Kickstarter, episode 8 out of 9 for Video Game High School.
11355000	11359000	So the last episode of this season is going to be on Thursday.
11359000	11364000	Can't wait, because it's been kind of frustrating.
11364000	11368000	And hopefully it's going to, well, better turn around for the last episode.
11368000	11371000	But yeah, I've liked it so far, though.
11371000	11377000	Alright. Well, that is going to bring to close another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11377000	11382000	But before we say goodnight, of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and say goodnight.
11382000	11386000	Alan, I want to thank you for joining us in the studio tonight.
11386000	11389000	And your wit and humor is always appreciated on the show.
11389000	11390000	Thank you.
11390000	11392000	Bring more of it next time. You're really funny.
11392000	11393000	Yeah.
11393000	11394000	I want the listeners to hear more of it.
11394000	11396000	I've been making dinner for like the last 20 minutes.
11396000	11398000	Oh, understandable.
11398000	11401000	Do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?
11401000	11405000	Strawberry pinkberry in the freezer. It's awesome.
11405000	11408000	And the apartment is really clean, and I have laundry to fold. That's it.
11408000	11411000	And that was really all you. I was a lazy bitch today.
11411000	11416000	And Alan was like, I'm going to clean. Although I did get the bed propped up and all that stuff.
11416000	11421000	And we need more people on our Origin friends list for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
11421000	11423000	Soon, soon.
11423000	11427000	If you're in the oil army, message me or Sky.
11427000	11428000	Do you have your name?
11428000	11431000	I'm AlanAlchemy78 on Origin.
11431000	11432000	Alright. There you go.
11432000	11433000	So play with us.
11433000	11434000	Play with me.
11434000	11437000	Although my galaxy is already at 100%.
11437000	11439000	Still, multiplayer is really fun.
11439000	11440000	Especially with friends.
11440000	11443000	Anyhow, Loki, your final thought tonight?
11443000	11450000	I don't even know how much money those guys must have thrown at this crappy game in order to get it finished in that amount of time.
11450000	11456000	Because I'm on the first challenge right now, which is a fine 480's themed with lunchboxes.
11456000	11460000	And I found one in like the last three hours.
11460000	11467000	I don't even know how it's possible. They must have spent hundreds of dollars on this.
11467000	11470000	And it's fucking boring.
11470000	11471000	I hate this game.
11471000	11473000	So much.
11473000	11476000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
11476000	11479000	I have a little bit of brain freeze.
11479000	11480000	And Garris.
11480000	11484000	My final thought tonight is Happy Canada Day.
11484000	11487000	First, I would like to learn how to speak.
11487000	11488000	Poutine!
11488000	11493000	Second, Happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.
11493000	11496000	I'm hoping to come visit your country again.
11496000	11499000	I had an absolute blast time in my life last time I was there.
11499000	11500000	Which was six years ago.
11500000	11502000	Which was far too long.
11502000	11504000	And last time was Vancouver.
11504000	11506000	And next time I'm thinking Toronto.
11506000	11507000	Right Alan?
11507000	11508000	Yes.
11508000	11509000	So we'll see.
11509000	11513000	So yes, Happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.
11513000	11515000	And the not so beautiful ones too.
11515000	11519000	Although I saw nothing but good looking people when I was in Vancouver.
11519000	11525000	I will also say Happy 4th of July to my fellow Americans this week.
11525000	11526000	Be safe.
11526000	11529000	Please do not set people's roofs on fire.
11529000	11532000	If you're going to do fireworks, especially illegal ones.
11532000	11534000	Have your bucket of water ready.
11534000	11536000	And just frickin' be safe with it.
11536000	11537000	Don't blow your finger off.
11537000	11539000	Don't be stupid.
11539000	11542000	The 4th of July is not to celebrate stupidity.
11542000	11545000	What if G asked if you ever said what the secret was?
11545000	11546000	What secret?
11546000	11548000	You said that you had a secret?
11548000	11549000	That I went back to Final Fantasy XI.
11549000	11550000	Oh, okay.
11550000	11552000	Did you know that before tonight?
11552000	11553000	Yeah, actually I did.
11553000	11554000	How did you know?
11554000	11556000	Because I saw your thing pop up.
11556000	11557000	Sky is playing.
11557000	11558000	Oh.
11558000	11560000	I would have thought you would have said something if that was the case.
11560000	11561000	Like, addict.
11561000	11562000	Didn't care.
11562000	11564000	Loki didn't know.
11564000	11565000	Alright.
11565000	11566000	Sorry.
11566000	11572000	If someone does want to help me with this, all they have to do is they can play the app
11572000	11576000	Ultimate Collector and then send me energy.
11576000	11577000	Or money.
11577000	11581000	I got a frown from Acidic Vampire because I'm only talking about PC Mass Effect.
11581000	11583000	And you will only plug the PC Mass Effect.
11583000	11585000	Of course, I still play on 360 too.
11585000	11588000	In fact, my unlocks on 360 are way better.
11588000	11589000	And guess what I did?
11589000	11590000	What?
11590000	11592000	I brought back your game.
11592000	11593000	Yay!
11593000	11594000	You know what's sad?
11594000	11597000	Even though I have one and two on PC now, I think I'm going to do the replays on Xbox
11597000	11600000	to get the rest of the achievements because I'm sad.
11600000	11602000	Whore.
11602000	11604000	Alright, that's it.
11604000	11608000	If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you didn't, help spread the word.
11608000	11609000	That's all we ask.
11609000	11611000	You know, we don't put commercials in the show.
11611000	11615000	All we ask, spread the word, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio, help grow
11615000	11617000	our family.
11617000	11618000	We had a new caller tonight.
11618000	11620000	We had some new faces tonight in chat.
11620000	11624000	I really want to thank all you guys for taking the time out to listen to Orange Lounge Radio
11624000	11626000	and help grow.
11626000	11632000	Ten more years started tonight and it'll continue next week on Alan's Birthday Show.
11632000	11633000	Yay!
11633000	11636000	Except, not really, but that's what we're going to call it anyway.
11636000	11638000	Have a great night everybody.
11638000	11639000	See you next time.
11639000	11641000	See you next time.
11669000	11671000	See you next week.
