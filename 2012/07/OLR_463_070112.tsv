13897	25047	Tonight, July 1, 2012, a full-time anime channel is console-bound, a classic edutainment title is set to become a movie, and one gaming company turns 40 years old.
31465	33046	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
53112	61681	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and have some lols and start 10 more years of the fun with my co-host.
62001	64524	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
64724	65665	Loki has curly fries.
66792	69273	I know, he always brings such yummy food and then waves it in front of us.
69293	70494	I think that he should give me one.
70514	72795	May I please have a curly fry?
72915	74416	Techmaster Loki here tonight.
74456	74977	What do you say?
75497	76617	Aw, he's handing one over.
76898	80259	Well, they gave me like small and a medium because they were out of large boxes.
80600	82881	So is that like jack-in-the-box math?
82961	84302	Small plus medium equals large?
84382	85182	Oh my god, grease.
85342	86743	Yeah, it's not worse.
86783	87864	Grease is truly the word.
88855	95700	Uh, joining us tonight, we have a special guest, um, somebody who hasn't been on the show in a while, but he's no stranger to OLR, but maybe some of you haven't heard him before.
96100	97601	Say hello to Alan!
97681	98041	Hello!
98261	99022	How are you doing?
99082	99662	I'm doing great.
100143	100623	Awesome.
100663	102344	Now, you're on the wonky mic tonight.
102384	106307	I might have to have you switch out, because I already heard some little crackle-shrackle.
106347	108908	So, yeah, chat, if I sound like crap, let us know.
109028	110890	Don't let me go through the whole show like this.
112010	112971	Or pretend he's a robot.
113191	113652	There you go.
114052	114813	How are you doing?
115133	115494	I'm good.
115634	117436	What's new with you since you were on the show last?
117456	118958	I don't even remember when you were actually on the show.
118978	122021	Well, you've made cameo appearances like one or two lines.
122081	128609	Yeah, I'll be in the office playing a game and then I will run out into the living room and just shout something that's relevant to the show when I'm not even on the show.
130211	131052	Does this microphone work?
131412	132213	It's not even plugged in.
132433	132833	It's muted.
132973	134354	I understand that, but would it work?
135255	140999	Yeah, in fact, the hissing is still happening, so I'm going to ask Alan to switch out the mic he's using and pick up that other one instead.
141019	141860	Let me actually mute that.
141960	143001	Live radio.
143021	144902	The choice of live radio at vognetwork.com.
145323	146363	Okay, try again.
146764	146964	Okay.
147464	150106	All right, you're just going to be a little quiet, so be sure you talk good and loud.
150146	152408	I'll turn up your gain a little bit, and that'll hopefully help.
153278	154919	Did you say you were going to turn up the gay a little bit?
155619	157040	No, the game.
158741	159862	Hey, girl.
159922	161163	Welcome to Orange Sound Radio.
161203	161923	What do?
162984	163304	Stop.
163744	167506	So I got a job in early May that has me working nights.
167786	172529	I work in a call center because it's an election year, doing political surveys.
172769	176651	And usually when OLR is taping for the last month and a half, I've been at work.
176771	180554	I get home at like 10 o'clock or like 9.30 when the show's wrapping up.
180674	180854	So...
181394	188659	Yeah, I got a little promotion, so I'm going to have later hours, but hopefully that doesn't start until next week.
189240	190621	So here I am, taking advantage.
190921	195044	So here you are, taking advantage of the week off that you have.
195204	195364	Yeah.
195504	196265	So, welcome.
197266	201629	All right, well, we are going to get in, of course, to all the news this week, or lack thereof.
201689	203810	Is it just me, or was it really kind of a slow news week?
203850	208754	I mean, when people are reporting on Twitter, that's usually an indication it's a slow week.
208914	210135	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
237714	240738	I want to read a conversation I was having with somebody online.
240818	249768	Now, I don't know this person super, super well, but they're a gamer and I'm a gamer, and I was kind of trying to figure out, okay, maybe there's a multiplayer game we play in common or whatever.
249829	254494	So I'm going to read this conversation that we have, and I want you guys to tell me what you think.
255035	257177	So he asked me, what games are you playing?
257998	261019	And I said, I've been stupid addicted to Mass Effect 3.
261759	265621	It's the first multiplayer game in a long time I can stand to play with strangers.
266041	269703	I just got into the whole series like three months ago, played all three games back to back.
269863	271863	And he replies, is that a first person shooter?
272484	275445	And I replied, it looks like one, but it doesn't really play like one.
275685	278206	On the easiest difficulty, your team does all the work for you.
278666	283768	I play a class that's more of a magic user, so I hang back, you know, I'm trying to kind of like put it in RPG terms.
284168	285189	JameemotionSick.com
301943	304924	First Person Shooters aren't real games, and the people who play them are not real gamers.
304944	305504	Those are fighting words.
324093	324974	Hold on, it gets better.
325634	331519	I replied, LOL, there's a big difference between Battlefield or Modern Warfare and Mass Effect, trust me.
331919	332780	No offense taken.
333000	333941	I know I'm a true gamer.
334101	334621	Happy face.
335302	337804	And the reply, LOL, if you say so.
338284	344029	I just feel fighting and first-person shooter games require no thought at all.
344369	345750	So yeah, LOL.
348533	352595	The amount of side-eye at this table right now, we're all just like, really?
352975	358698	Ask any of the people who play in the Street Fighter tournaments and how they obsess over their technique.
359898	361419	I was just really taken aback.
361459	364020	Well, anyway, I replied back.
364080	367602	I said, you know, I'm trying to be nice, but at this point I'm like, dude, what are you smoking?
367922	370503	So I'm like, fighting games is a pretty broad category.
370583	375585	I'm not very good at a lot of the modern ones, but in some ways, combat on the 2600 is a fighting game.
377506	381213	I'm kind of trying to say, dude, you're being ignorant right now.
381513	385561	So I asked back, I said, so what does make a real gamer?
386282	386723	No reply.
388573	388893	Of course.
390134	390774	Is this someone I know?
391054	391314	No, no.
391414	393555	This is people online.
393955	395435	You don't understand that you've been trolled.
397316	398436	No, I don't think so.
398596	401817	I think this person was very legitimate in their thinking.
402217	410600	But I was really surprised at how offended I was at that initial comment, like that first-person shooter players are not real gamers.
411100	415441	I don't play first-person shooters a lot, but I've played Quake.
415822	416862	I've played Doom.
417302	418503	I've played, you know...
444400	454268	Dictionary.com Gamer A person who plays games, especially computer or video games The end Do you play games on your computer?
455109	459392	Yeah, I was actually playing a couple earlier today Do you play games on a console?
459452	461654	But Jamie, one of them was a first person shooter
463093	469300	According to the dictionary, a gamer is one who plays games And you know, I played a fighting game before
472060	482444	I'm just trying to imagine this person playing Civ 2 or Civ 3 blindfolded with pins going into his body because the pain brings him closer to the experience.
482464	485025	So what kind of games does this person play?
485125	485766	I have no idea.
485986	486786	I asked.
486826	487566	I didn't get a reply.
488187	489227	I think this person gave up.
489287	492068	Because I'm just... Because clearly I'm ignorant.
492428	494209	Clearly I'm an idiot.
494329	507474	There's really all games out there have some sort of strategy or actual skill involved, except for pure random luck games like gambling a slot machine.
507514	509815	There's no sort of skill there.
511936	514817	So it's kind of stupid to say, oh, well, they're not really gamers.
515077	522980	Now, I understand that, yeah, you can get a lot of people button mashing first-person shooters and fighting games, but
525930	541207	Miriam Webster Dictionary Gamer A player who is game, especially an athlete who relishes competition A person who plays games, especially a person who regularly plays computer or video games
542389	543030	Marion Webster.
543130	545532	Now I'm going to try... What's the other one?
546033	546393	Webster.
546493	553541	Let's go to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show, live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate live here with our show.
554022	557245	And you can check in if you're listening live at vognetwork.com and get your points.
557325	560308	And I'm going to talk about check-ins in a little bit, but we've still got some ground to cover.
560649	564152	So reading from chat, I want to start with Burr tonight because...
564893	567316	This comment that he says here is it for me.
567396	568417	It's hitting the nail on the head.
568477	572500	Burr says, you're not a real gamer unless you only play what I play.
573201	575483	And that's, I think, exactly where this guy is at.
576064	578986	And I'm going to guess he didn't answer my question.
579046	581108	He's had a day and a half to answer and he's not answered.
581889	583891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
601198	602519	I've been like, I'm gonna kill you.
602880	603540	I'm gonna kill you.
603580	605101	Not really, but I'm gonna kill you with words.
605242	606062	He's wrong anyway.
606623	607464	He is, he is.
607584	609465	We have a dictionary definition, one who plays games.
610026	614590	And I would even expand on that, that there's tabletop gamers, you know?
615731	621256	We used to say, you know, when we talk about going to a tabletop game, we say we're going to game.
621916	623317	I mean, so it's the same thing.
623698	625039	A gamer is one who plays games.
625971	631537	Um, AcidicVampire in our chatroom says, seriously, tell that guy to play Bioshock and then we'll talk.
632058	640307	There's a really good example of a first-person shooter that's, like, definitely not Modern Warfare, Battlefield, like, you know... Or Portal.
641087	642989	Oh, yeah, Portal's a great... I mean...
644085	646106	And that actually doesn't make me motion sick.
646207	649269	Portal is an amazing first-person shooter, if you think about it.
649369	655733	Well, this is also exactly like, you know, you're not a real sports fan, you know, if you like hockey or soccer.
656674	657414	Football, though!
657835	658355	Real football.
658535	659035	Football.
661117	662558	I'm calling it soccer because I'm American.
662998	663538	I can do that.
663939	665039	I can be ignorant like that.
665400	667081	But we all know what I'm talking about.
668126	672708	Okay, so this guy is obviously often La La Land whatever.
673288	682611	There's a reason why I bring it up on the show, though, is because what is it about this gaming culture where we're so quick to judge other people and exclude them?
682651	683912	And I'm going to give you an example.
684953	690678	Going to our chat room, GameGuru says, The casual games are just extensions of genres from gaming's past.
691038	693561	For example, Bejeweled is a puzzle game like Tetris.
693881	698105	So GameGuru brought up casual games, to which I say, Alright, then Facebook games.
700467	701108	Sims?
701408	702389	They're kind of Sims?
702569	709836	Would somebody that plays The Sims Social and Cityville and Price is Right Slots, is that a gamer?
709856	709896	No.
710711	711551	The slots, no.
712112	713993	Because it's a slot machine type thing.
714033	714773	Well, isn't that a game?
714813	716374	This is how I look at it.
716774	720876	You have a gamer as a blanket, and then you have types of gamers.
720976	722216	You have casual gamers.
722697	723997	You have your RPG gamers.
724017	725678	You have your tabletop gamers, like I said earlier.
726038	726979	You've got your board gamers.
728079	730240	One who plays a game is a gamer.
730920	731921	It just depends on what they like.
733211	738554	But why do people feel the need then to assert that their way is the only way?
738774	740335	Because Catholics are like that too.
741696	742196	No, no, no.
742336	743417	I'm going somewhere with this.
743977	745658	It's like religion and politics.
747319	748840	Catholics think their way is the only way.
749081	750442	I'm using a blanket term.
751362	754045	The Southern Baptists, of course, think everyone else is going to hell.
755706	757647	It's that type of mentality.
758448	760850	We are better than you because you don't think the way that we do.
761350	763913	You have the Libertarians.
763993	765694	Oh, Lord, let's not go with the Libertarians.
766435	768336	You have the Socialists.
768356	769777	You've got Republicans, Democrats.
769877	776643	Everyone thinks that their way is the best, and anyone who is not in their group is immediately inferior because they're not in that group.
777927	778147	Alan?
780008	801138	My theory is, he's insecure, he's caught shit for the games that he's played before, he now has a support group, and he's old enough to play the games that he likes to play, where he doesn't give a fuck, and he doesn't get catch shit for it anymore, but he's still, because he's built that support group of like, these are the games I play, these are where my friends are, he's still got that insecurity, he only wants to relate to people that...
801858	802859	play the same stuff as him.
802979	809982	That's actually a fascinating way to look at it because you're essentially saying the reason why he's like that is because it happened to him in reverse.
810523	811823	That's essentially what you're saying, right?
812024	812204	Yeah.
812324	814345	He's insecure and he's got some lingering issues.
814445	815525	And I could see that.
815605	819207	He's caught shit for playing the games that he likes to play, but now he's fine.
819848	821369	But that's still his safe space.
821589	828612	I could totally see that because back when it was all about Dance Dance Revolution for us and so forth, there were people that said...
829833	831034	All they talk about is DDR.
831114	832275	It's not a video game show.
832635	834597	It's a DDR rave lights show.
836599	837740	Lights don't come through radio.
838601	845847	And I know that you love this game, so this is a bad example, but think back when you were crazy about DDR and someone was like, oh, I love music rhythm games.
845987	846547	And you're like, what?
846567	847428	And they say Parappa.
847848	849450	And you're all, okay.
851364	852905	He plays Parappa, guys!
853065	855546	Oh, here's a good example.
856467	857027	In the groove.
858668	859329	I'm just kidding.
859369	861170	I'm not going to fan those plays.
861410	862810	Let them die.
863611	864892	No, in the groove was fine.
866332	867093	I'm not even going to go there.
867233	868353	Just walk away.
870568	873951	Porkchop in chat asks, Sky, is this guy young or old?
874011	875592	It's a bit of a juvenile opinion.
875672	876213	Mid-twenties.
877674	890664	That's kind of mid... Especially nowadays with, you know... Nowadays, those whippersnappers... Basically, a lot of the people I interact with on forums that are of the teenage age range...
892225	901136	are pretty immature, and I can imagine that they, unless they finally grow up, that they kind of continue to go that way through their mid-20s.
901196	903739	It's like everybody's a decade behind nowadays.
904232	912279	Well, I think at the end of the day, if you guys are going to, you know, judge other people based on the games they play, just kind of, you know, watch yourself.
912760	913360	Watch yourself.
913460	922408	Because we're creating this cycle, right, where now, you know, that person that we point our fingers at will turn around and do it to somebody else.
922448	924110	It's like we should try to be more inclusive, right?
924170	925231	Am I being too much of a hippie?
926472	926652	Yeah.
927119	929921	I don't want to meet this guy because he's an idiot.
929941	930061	Yeah.
956738	958480	Bow Chicka Wow Wow
984562	988844	So this person is in the mindset where everything is right now, everything is immediate.
989344	992305	You don't like what I like, so I don't care about what you like.
992665	994245	What's in front of me is what's important to me.
995146	1001668	And, you know, I'm sure that all of us understand that once you hit your 30s, you kind of don't give a crap about that kind of drama anymore.
1002508	1003869	So it's not as important.
1004349	1009411	I guarantee you this person, when he's in his 30s, is going to say, man, I was stupid.
1010853	1015582	It's like pulling up your live journal from six years ago and going, Oh God, I did that.
1015742	1017807	I wanted to go back in time and shoot myself.
1020842	1022683	All right, look, we got to move on with the show.
1023424	1027547	I just, you know, I was so struck by that conversation.
1027727	1030309	I was just like, oh, my God, I've got to bring it up on OLR.
1030629	1037654	And the one thing I did want to say, when I was talking to that guy, he did not know that I did this show, like that I've been doing it and so forth and where I'm coming from.
1037795	1039796	But it's, I don't know, it's kind of funny.
1039816	1041657	It pays to do your research, individual.
1043098	1044239	Facebook stalk me next time.
1044319	1044559	All right.
1045059	1045760	Moving on.
1046040	1050723	Let's talk about our gaming weeks because we're all gamers here at OLR and so are you guys in our chat room.
1050743	1057166	And if you're listening to this on the podcast feed, you must enjoy video games enough that you want to hear a bunch of strangers online talk about it.
1057446	1060848	And DDR Dollar Bill, I can't go back in time and shoot myself because I wouldn't be here.
1061028	1064790	So maybe I just smack myself around and then use that little men in black thing to make me forget.
1064810	1066451	You would have to be a looper in order to do that.
1067572	1067852	All right.
1068152	1068632	Gaming week.
1068652	1069233	Star Soccer.
1069253	1070073	Why don't you start us off?
1070113	1071814	You said something about being holed up in the Normandy.
1072262	1076245	Yeah, I was hanging out in the life support room and in the battery.
1078987	1080588	Were you getting it on with Dr. Chakwas?
1080608	1081929	Because that's what I've always wanted to do.
1081949	1087453	No, but it's funny when you go drinking with her and she starts doing the whole dancing thing.
1087513	1088093	It's pretty funny.
1088333	1090415	Blackwolf in our chatroom says Garrus isn't a gamer.
1092458	1093298	He plays some games.
1093418	1094339	Alright, moving on, moving on.
1094359	1100702	But yeah, I've been playing, I started Mass Effect 2 last weekend and I'm at the last set of missions now.
1101442	1106904	So, I haven't beaten a game that had that much stuff in it that quickly since Final Fantasy 6.
1108165	1109125	Or 3 when it was out.
1109265	1110526	So, that's saying something.
1111747	1112427	No, I take that back.
1112467	1113927	I played Dew Prism pretty quickly.
1115248	1117589	And the DLC, it's all really good, right?
1117609	1118309	They were all enjoyable.
1118369	1118990	Oh, hell yeah!
1119971	1124898	and yeah they were saying that the Overlord one was supposed to be like two and a half hours you said it was like two and a half hours
1125615	1130536	I took Samara, by the way, not Morinth, because Morinth was a bitch Which is the right thing to do, let's be real
1152526	1153486	Yeah.
1153987	1158728	But I have seen the Mournth seduction scene and that was pretty funny because dude Shep is just stupid.
1159449	1160349	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
1160869	1161469	Bad voice acting.
1161870	1166631	I'm totally going after Garrus but I have a save file to where I can go back for Thane if I wanted to.
1168152	1168432	The end.
1169812	1171273	So now I have to go buy Mass Effect 3 tomorrow.
1172473	1173814	Mass Effect, Mass Effect, more Mass Effect.
1174334	1174594	Loki!
1174614	1176835	Wait, wait, I did play some WoW for five minutes.
1177415	1179456	You gotta get use out of that annual pass.
1180016	1181797	Yeah, well I logged in so I wouldn't get kicked out of the guild.
1182122	1185784	Actually, I'm switching it up because I know Loki's about to go on a rant.
1185824	1188426	So let's go to Alan first.
1188526	1189567	Alan, how was your gaming week?
1189947	1190487	It was all right.
1190927	1193269	I checked in on my Minecraft world.
1193789	1197431	I have an article that I need to finish for VOG about Minecraft.
1198792	1200053	I'm playing in survival mode.
1200394	1202876	I finally found a world that has a terrain that I like.
1203676	1208120	And I'm playing on survival mode where you have to eat and there's supposed to be monsters, but I have it on peaceful.
1208540	1212183	And I thought, I'm going to play it on peaceful until I find a good cave and I build my house.
1213240	1221343	But I'm so into the exploration and creativity that every time I flip it from survival to easy so that the monsters will spawn, they just irritate me.
1222144	1223124	It's not like I'm afraid of dying.
1223144	1225365	It's like I'm trying to build an expansion in my house.
1225425	1226425	Fucking go away, creeper.
1226445	1227626	So I just turn the monsters off.
1227706	1230487	So maybe the whole combat aspect of Minecraft isn't for me.
1230967	1231347	I don't know.
1232808	1233928	Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
1234068	1235449	I'm trying to unlock all the characters.
1236949	1257661	I've been working on my dude Paragon Mass Effect 3 because I've already seen my FemShep Renegade ending like a couple weeks ago and I logged I checked out Dragon Age 2 to see how long I had spent on it because I haven't touched that game since February and I had spent 14 hours and I deleted the save so I could start over because I don't remember a goddamn thing
1258700	1259060	And that's it.
1259180	1259880	Those are my three games.
1260801	1261081	All right.
1261861	1264061	Can I talk about how I obtained Mass Effect 3?
1264302	1265102	Yeah, actually.
1265122	1268803	Because it was legal, but it was one of those like, hmm.
1268883	1284227	I think Loki might remember this story, but a couple months ago when Battlefield 3 came out, there was this scandal where people had bought codes from overseas, like the China edition of a code for cheap, and EA wanted to disable the codes, something like that.
1284793	1285373	I don't remember that.
1285673	1285914	Okay.
1286654	1293397	Well, I was trying to price hunt Mass Effect 3 for Origin, thinking maybe Amazon or Best Buy or something had a code.
1293437	1297399	So I went to Google Shopping and I just said, Mass Effect 3 sale, Origin code.
1297899	1303322	And I found a site, and I'm not going to say what site it is because I don't want it to sound like that OLR is endorsing this.
1303342	1304742	But you just told everyone how to find it.
1305443	1305723	Sorry.
1305763	1305903	Yeah.
1306403	1306944	All right.
1332717	1336939	I get the code within a minute of submitting it and it's a little PNG file.
1337279	1341301	It's literally a scan of the code that you get on the back of the jewel case if you bought it.
1341922	1351827	I put it into Origin and it worked fine and then in Origin it says Mass Effect 3 Standard Edition US slash UK slash RU so it's some like European code.
1352267	1355349	So this site just bought a bunch of overseas codes in bulk.
1356309	1357270	I didn't have a problem with it.
1357370	1359791	Or picked them up out of a box that fell off a truck.
1361052	1377056	Well, actually, it depends on how the DLC goes out to the retailers because there's been times, and I still have hundreds of them left, that they will send you an Excel sheet with codes listed.
1377096	1383097	Okay, here's all the... You guys have X amount of copies that you've ordered from this company.
1383217	1385037	Here's the codes for your PS3 copies.
1385078	1385918	Here's the codes for your 360 copies.
1387418	1396262	Some of those may be going to rental stores or libraries or people that don't need the DLC codes and so there's a bunch of excess left over.
1396642	1413250	Now, I don't know about the ones that would be included in a package or whatever, but a lot of that stuff that goes to GameStop or even small mom and pop retailers, there could be a bunch of that stuff lying around out there because people didn't need them.
1414642	1417463	So I can play multiplayer fine on the official EA servers.
1417603	1423886	I'm not worried about the SWAT team rappelling down and crashing through the windows or Origin spontaneously just turning off my Mass Effect 3.
1424007	1428829	But yeah, I took a risk on one of these sites and spent $22 for a $59 game.
1428929	1433571	And I'm not saying I would do it again, but I didn't have a bad experience.
1433811	1434872	It worked out fine for me.
1435612	1464300	interesting see I'm trying to figure out like where does when I showed you the site because you're considering getting Mass Effect 3 for PC so that you could play with me which I ended up getting through Best Buy when they had a sale and you looked at the site and you're like honey this looks shady as fuck and I was like well I did Google the name of the site plus scam name of the site reviews to see if people have bad experiences and it looked legit so that's why I went for it but yeah there's something about the whole concept of buying overseas codes domestically for that cheap is weird but
1465580	1467282	Keep monitoring your credit card statements.
1467302	1468162	That's all I'm going to say.
1468182	1468983	That's why I use PayPal.
1469483	1471604	I wouldn't use my credit card.
1472585	1479990	I hope it was just excess copies in Russia or something that got unloaded on this site.
1480050	1481411	I really hope you don't get screwed.
1481771	1482151	We'll see.
1484353	1486654	I would never advise somebody to do that.
1486674	1488436	You're taking a huge, huge risk.
1488876	1491618	I know you obviously very well.
1491678	1494280	You weighed the pros and the cons and went for it.
1495541	1497423	Do you think you would buy another game this way?
1498745	1504271	Or do you think maybe it's worth the extra $10 or whatever next time to just have the peace of mind it's a legit place?
1504431	1511039	I would buy it through a legit or more legit like an actual game client like Steam or Origin or Amazon.
1511359	1513802	But because I'm so broke right now...
1514563	1516525	I absolutely wanted to pay money for the game.
1516545	1517727	I was just like, how cheap can I do this?
1517747	1518748	And I found a way that worked.
1536727	1550275	Well, and there's actually, on Amazon right now, there's a seller selling a boxed copy and everything for $28, and you pay $4 shipping, although I could pay $39 on Amazon right now and buy the boxed copy and get free shipping.
1550715	1554057	So, if I don't see it cheaper, it fries, pretty much.
1554577	1566920	Alright, well thank you for sharing your story Let's move on and talk about Loki's Gaming Week Which, as I understand from what we heard at the end of Bobby Blackwolf's show Was a little bit controversial, right Loki?
1567260	1580284	Well, yeah, some of it So, I played lots of Minecraft, which is part of the course Finished my Demon Head entrance to my volcanic lair type thing And it looks pretty awesome
1581198	1591103	Although one gripe I have about the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is, you know how you take screenshots and stuff and you can set your gamma settings so that you can actually see it on your TV?
1591783	1595245	It doesn't adjust for those settings when you take a screenshot.
1595345	1599447	So it was completely bright on my screen, but completely dark in the picture I took.
1599887	1600508	It's kind of annoying.
1600608	1604390	They should make it so that it shows what you have on your screen.
1605450	1605510	Um...
1607131	1612276	Then I played more Modern Warfare 3 and that was fun.
1612476	1613117	Still kicking ass.
1614598	1622605	Hopefully, they're supposed to be releasing a new free map soon for Terminal, which I believe is a remade Modern Warfare 2 map.
1623266	1624428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1639046	1648992	and all of them were supposed to be retro challenges kind of tied into like the whole, you know, book because it was all about, you know, old retro 80s games and stuff.
1649032	1662019	I mean, one of the challenges they had was, you know, playing Joust against this, you know, computer player and, you know, Zork and God, I can't remember the third challenge.
1662039	1665021	I think it was playing music or something.
1665321	1667602	Anyways, so stuff like that.
1669295	1669595	DarkSakura.com
1683786	1688247	The second gate, however, not quite along those lines.
1688867	1698090	Instead, it is go play this game that's created by Richard Garrett, the guy behind Ultima Online.
1698390	1700570	He's traveled the space and all that fun shit.
1702831	1703812	Ultimate Collector Garage Sale
1719228	1727677	Um, it's, of course, one of those free games that you would see on Facebook that, you know, nickel and dime you for every goddamn thing that you want to do in it.
1728498	1730580	And that's no different with this one.
1731361	1737467	Um, and it looks kind of like The Sims, but there's already people that have completed this challenge.
1737487	1738068	Um.
1738608	1752838	And I can tell you right now, having played this game for about four hours, there is no way you can do that in that time frame without paying money to get extra dollars or whatever to be able to cycle things faster, give yourself more energy, and that kind of thing.
1752858	1755260	So basically, they bought their way through this game.
1756080	1761084	And it's definitely proven in the screenshot of the first person that did finish it.
1761384	1764546	He had two credit cards sitting there right next to his computer monitor, so...
1767637	1770239	It's just kind of a really bad vibe.
1770459	1774983	I mean, they went from this really cool retro game challenge thing to, hey, play this Facebook game.
1775083	1777084	You know there's fucking money switching hands there.
1777485	1795499	And yeah, it's kind of cool that they hid some stuff in here, but I've played this game for, like I said, about four hours, and I've only come up with maybe two of the items I'm supposed to be finding for this thing, and there's like about, I think, 50-some items that you need to find.
1796758	1797579	And it's all random.
1797919	1815217	So there's no... I'll be lucky to finish it within a month's time, let alone knocking it out in a day, which I was hoping to be able to knock everything out in a day or so, because get a jump on it like I didn't quite do with the first gate, but...
1818055	1823999	It's really disappointing that this is what it's come down to, is that they have this crappy Facebook game.
1824039	1832945	And I hate playing Facebook games, or at least this type of game, where it's like, oh yeah, you know, you want to rummage through that box, well it's going to cost you one energy.
1833085	1834306	Oh, you don't have energy right now?
1834486	1836167	You can pay some money to get some energy.
1836968	1840190	Or hey, you don't have enough money to buy that upgrade.
1840290	1843712	The type of competition you guys are playing, that was a terrible idea.
1844332	1844953	It really was.
1846134	1847115	There's no skill in this.
1847175	1850677	The skill in this is having the patience to fucking wait this long.
1850697	1852359	They gotta pay for that DeLorean somehow.
1853430	1855491	He can pay for it with his book sales money.
1855531	1857133	I mean, he didn't have to do this.
1857273	1863096	Maybe the next contest will be getting to play Tabula Rasa, the other great Lord British game.
1863477	1865378	No, I shouldn't kick him when he's down.
1865478	1870501	Obviously, the Ultima series was phenomenal, so important to gaming history.
1870521	1871902	And I don't blame him at all.
1872363	1874104	It's not... You know, so what?
1874144	1875605	He wants to create a Facebook game, that's fine.
1875985	1877906	I have no problem with him creating a Facebook game.
1878026	1881909	I have a problem with him using this Facebook game in the state that it is.
1882049	1882930	It's not finished.
1883770	1887553	Using it to further this contest.
1887673	1891335	And yeah, it's cool that they hid all these different items in this game.
1891956	1894317	But it's not done.
1894497	1895998	It's buggy.
1896038	1901122	When I first started playing it, I ran into a glitch where I was selling stuff in my garage sale.
1901582	1902703	And the items disappeared.
1902883	1905985	And then those racks that I was using, I couldn't put anything on them.
1906065	1913130	And you're limited to a certain amount of racks that you have in your garage sale area, I guess.
1913610	1919351	and so it was stuck for a few days and I couldn't do anything.
1919431	1933434	And then they finally fixed it and then they had people having trouble logging into the server because the server was down because too many people were hammering it and then there was an issue where the link from the actual contest to the Facebook game was broken.
1934354	1936855	It's just as a... It's bad.
1937435	1942616	And I don't like, you know... I just don't like the way it's being handled right now but...
1944202	1952488	I'm still going to play it because I have to in order to get to the next gate or at least be able to be in the running still.
1952608	1958472	So it's just sad that I have to do this the hard way, whereas I see these guys, yeah, I beat it in four hours.
1958552	1960193	But it won't matter at the end of the day, right?
1960213	1961895	You just have to clear it in 30 days, right?
1962035	1967719	I just have to clear it within 30 days, but I just hope the last gate isn't anything like this bullshit.
1967759	1970020	Yeah, that would be a real stinker on the competition.
1970040	1970641	Yeah.
1971321	1972462	So that's that.
1973262	1974183	Anything else for your gaming week?
1977985	1978745	I think that's it.
1979086	1980306	Alright, so my gaming week.
1980967	1982007	A lot of the same old stuff.
1982027	1984829	I've been playing Mass Effect 3, a little bit of World of Warcraft.
1985349	1988211	I can't think of anything new that I tried this week.
1988611	1994794	I went back to a game from a couple years ago just because I just had an itch to play it and that's New Super Mario Bros.
1994834	1995055	Wii.
1995395	1995715	I don't know.
1995775	1997216	I just never finished it years ago.
1997236	1999197	I got really close and never finished it years and years ago.
1999717	2004341	So, I just went back and played it a little bit, and I was like, oh, it's actually a pretty good Mario game.
2004401	2012366	I forgot, like, how much of the Mario universe, not to be confused with the game, they kind of brought into this game.
2012446	2017050	So, you know, the fact that there's Yoshi and Fire Flowers and Ice Flowers, but anyway, it's an old game.
2017450	2023354	Either you've played it by now or you haven't, or you're waiting for the next one on Wii U, like I'm sure Loki is with great anticipation.
2023374	2024275	Okay.
2024455	2034586	So I promised a little while ago we could talk about a game that I've been playing that I didn't tell a lot of people that I was going to go play because it just kind of happened.
2035707	2042254	I've been having the codes sitting in my Steam account for probably about a year now because Alan trolled me.
2042975	2050339	when he used to hear me talk about this game an awful lot and he said, oh look, it's on sale on Steam right now for just like $9.99.
2050479	2054121	I'm going to buy these codes for you just to kind of troll you a little bit.
2054182	2060785	It was when the finances were better and all that stuff and we could throw $10 at each other to troll each other with stuff.
2062346	2063287	But I never used it.
2063367	2064948	I'm like, I'm too busy playing these other games.
2064988	2066228	I'm not going to go back and play this game.
2066248	2071071	I don't have the time to sink into this crap because this game is such a time sink.
2071231	2072152	I don't have time for it.
2073385	2075607	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2095236	2108681	And I gotta tell you, yes, a lot has changed The game is drastically different Let me put this into perspective Loki, I know you played Final Fantasy XI for a long time So I know you'll be able to speak this language, you ready?
2109101	2114243	Do you know what I accomplished in three days of light gameplay on Final Fantasy XI?
2114824	2115884	No, what did you accomplish?
2116204	2121627	I am level 25 White Mage with a Black Mage subjob already leveled.
2123267	2124488	And I did the subjob quest.
2125308	2126289	That's pretty awesome.
2127109	2132572	It might have been over three days, but you and Nikolatov have been playing a lot in the last three days.
2132712	2134553	So don't say, like, casually in an hour.
2135493	2136954	You gained five levels.
2137234	2138014	Well, yes.
2138414	2141195	Once we figured out what we were doing, yes, it has been that fast.
2141795	2151178	I guess the thing is now, one of the things that was implemented in the game that changed things drastically is they put in these things called field manuals, which are these books that sit out in the open.
2151758	2153519	And you do what's called page burning.
2153859	2156600	You take a page and it'll say, kill six worms.
2157120	2163962	So you go out, you kill six worms, and you get bonus XP and you get bonus skill once every real world hour
2164542	2166463	I'm sorry, you get the bonus XP every time.
2166823	2172965	You get bonus gil and this other thing called tabs once every real world hour so that way you can't just be getting it and getting it.
2173425	2180627	So what people do now is one of the zones, Gusken Mines, one of the book burns is kill six skeletons.
2181267	2192491	So people go into parties there at level 10 and book burn over and over and over, just pull skeletons over and over in alliances of 18 people just pulling these skeletons over and over
2193351	2195974	and level, level, level, level, level, level.
2196114	2197655	You're just gaining levels that fast.
2198236	2205804	And apparently, you do it in Gusken Mines, you do it in Crawler's Nest, you do it in one of the dungeons, and you're all the way to 75 in a couple days.
2206484	2210889	That's what, like, the leveling game is gone in Final Fantasy XI.
2211069	2212590	It's just you sit there and collect XP.
2212911	2214993	People go AFK and just sit there and collect the XP.
2215533	2216194	Thanks for watching!
2236835	2238037	Thank you for watching!
2255677	2256257	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2275606	2277447	No, there isn't.
2278628	2280469	You get the XP every time.
2280889	2282070	Six skeletons, XP.
2282950	2283790	Six more, XP.
2283850	2284571	Six more, XP.
2284931	2288633	You get the gill and the tabs once an hour.
2289173	2291034	That just makes me think of that Eddie Izzard sketch.
2291695	2293396	You have crossed a bridge, champagne!
2293436	2294976	You have entered a shop, champagne!
2295397	2296797	You've left a shop, champagne!
2297198	2299079	You have fallen into a ditch, junk, champagne!
2299159	2301540	There actually is a zone called Sarah Magoo Champagne.
2303263	2305305	I just made a Final Fantasy XI joke.
2305365	2306606	I'm done with that game.
2306866	2307206	Anyhow.
2308267	2312030	Alright, so anyway, that's... Oh my god, something just popped into my head.
2312130	2312310	What?
2313251	2314172	A Mass Effect MMO.
2315773	2316834	Wouldn't it be awesome?
2316954	2319796	It would, but... BioWare, do it!
2320396	2324039	BioWare did the Star Trek MMO and it's having issues, so they've got to clear those up first.
2324059	2325200	Could I play an Elcor monk?
2326761	2327522	That would be great.
2328536	2328916	Anywhere.
2329176	2329497	Anyway.
2330497	2331058	That's really it.
2331838	2339303	I'm going to try to do some more writing for VOG and kind of write my thoughts a little bit more and put some screenshots up there so you guys have an idea of what's going on.
2340264	2344066	I've had a couple people in chat saying, you should go back and try it.
2344086	2344726	You should go back and try it.
2344746	2345267	A lot's changed.
2345387	2346488	Alright, so I finally went back.
2347449	2348489	I was slow in doing it.
2348509	2350070	It's like Jamie playing Mass Effect finally.
2350390	2353391	Took me a little while, but now that I'm doing it, yeah, I'm enjoying it.
2353851	2355071	Am I going to leave WoW for it?
2355291	2355492	No.
2355952	2360493	The only reason this is catching on right now is because there's not a lot to do in WoW right now.
2360533	2364434	But once the panda people hit, I'll probably be saying bye-bye to Final Fantasy XI.
2364714	2368015	A lot of it is really about the people, and I just don't know people in Final Fantasy XI.
2368035	2368416	Druid Guild.
2369536	2370636	We need a Druid Guild night.
2371456	2372257	All right, let me know when.
2373417	2373677	Anyhow.
2373817	2376478	I would not play a Turian, but I would romance a Turian.
2377658	2378419	Answering Tigerclaw.
2380839	2382040	I would play a Drell.
2383060	2389442	Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Although I haven't played it in years, I used to love Final Fantasy XI.
2389982	2393843	It has changed a lot, and I guess in some ways for the better, in some ways not for the better.
2394303	2400065	So, anyhow, that was my experiences with Final Fantasy XI and my gaming week.
2400799	2402240	All right, let's move on.
2402780	2403661	Housekeeping tonight.
2404141	2406722	I want to talk a little bit about something new on VOG Network.
2407223	2409104	First off, thank you to everybody.
2409644	2413826	The full website has been launched for 30 days now, and I can't believe it's only been a month.
2414287	2418569	It feels like it's kind of been a lot longer than that, but maybe I'm thinking about the temporary site we had and all that.
2419029	2421971	But the first month of VOG Network has been very successful.
2422451	2425673	Bobby wrote a whole little summary with number crunching like mad.
2426033	2427534	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2453691	2454532	I want to make this clear.
2454632	2456273	For now, it's being tested.
2456293	2457813	We're calling July a test phase.
2458174	2460975	So it's only available on certain VOG shows.
2461395	2466778	It's only available on Bobby Blackwolf, our show, and it will be available next week on Understation Live.
2467078	2468299	That's it for right now.
2468379	2474182	But in the future, hopefully it'll work and we'll be able to roll it out to more shows in the future.
2474702	2490730	How the podcast check-ins work is that at some point throughout the show, and it's never going to be in the same place because we know how people like to work the system, at some point during the show, you will hear a little pre-recorded message.
2491011	2491511	And you know what?
2491531	2494512	For the podcast listeners, I'm going to make tonight's very, very easy.
2495633	2502917	To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase ZONE.
2504505	2508526	Now for the live listeners, you didn't get to hear anything right there because this is for the podcast.
2508546	2511987	This is something they're going to have because you get to check into the shows when they're live.
2512027	2525350	But for the podcast, for whatever that word was that you just heard, you're going to go to vognetwork.com and you're going to put that word right there underneath the leaderboard and you'll be able to check into the show, get the same amount of points that the live listeners get for listening live.
2525570	2530952	Because the point is, live, podcast, you're participating, we still love you either way.
2530992	2532572	So we want you to get the points either way.
2533032	2538334	Now, if you listen live and you check in on the podcast, you're not going to get the points twice.
2538654	2543916	Sorry, we just thought that would be too much of an unfair advantage to the individuals that have the time for both.
2545076	2552339	But you might want to still consider doing it anyway if you do happen to listen to both or you listen to part of one and go back and listen to the podcast later.
2553720	2569575	I would encourage you to do it because it's still being tracked in case one day there is show specific loot for example we might give you some loot if you check into the podcast and the live show three weeks in a row or something like that I don't know hypothetical we haven't designed any of that yet
2570055	2572057	So, there you go.
2572757	2577480	That is now a feature that is available to you guys at vognetwork.com.
2577600	2579061	Podcast check-ins.
2579562	2582223	Trying to make sure if I'm forgetting anything.
2582344	2583144	I don't think so.
2583224	2585786	I think, again, it could be at any point throughout the show.
2586286	2587967	I'm not going to explain it every week.
2588268	2592030	If you want more of an explanation, one is available at vognetwork.com.
2592070	2597174	Right next to the little box where you put in the password to check in is a little thing that says, What's this?
2597834	2626606	and Bobby Blackwolf wrote a great little summary on the website at vognetwork.com and if you're listening live and you have no idea what the hell this is all about you're missing your chance buddy to collect some points and maybe some loot go to vognetwork.com register for the site and whenever we're live as we are right now you're going to see a link that says right there on the front page on the left side participate now and get points and you go and you get points for checking into the show super easy
2627751	2629574	Okay, I think that's that.
2630015	2633240	Let's move on with some gaming news.
2634101	2635102	I need to throw this out there, though.
2635142	2640951	Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, Google+, search for Orange Lounge Radio.
2641332	2641732	There you go.
2642607	2643828	Let's get into some actual gaming news.
2644088	2644328	Loki.
2644768	2653633	So, let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And the Wii U, Nintendo has already come out and said, Hey, you know what?
2654053	2657295	The Wii U, it's not going to be this really expensive system.
2657875	2661177	It's going to have a reasonable price.
2661357	2665299	And basically, Satoru Iwata, he said that the...
2667160	2676448	The initial price point of the 3DS was considered relatively high by consumers and that they won't make the same mistake with the Wii U. So I don't know.
2676709	2677409	What do you think?
2680282	2684227	I was privy to a little something Is this Secret Club?
2684267	2685829	Do we need to say don't tell other people this?
2686189	2686790	That you heard it here?
2688652	2699085	I don't know I think I've covered my Alright, let's go ahead and just make sure If you're going to tell other people this big piece of information Loki's about to share You didn't hear it here
2700330	2703552	Well, some of this is what it means.
2704252	2709255	So, the Wii U, I think, is a reasonable price.
2709415	2712076	It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.
2712156	2714758	There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with.
2715658	2716579	What's in those SKUs?
2716859	2717380	No idea.
2717960	2720923	What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.
2721324	2724026	So the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99.
2726689	2727569	So there's that.
2727890	2733695	The next price up, $299.99 and then $349.99 are the three different price points.
2734156	2737439	Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely speculative.
2737519	2739421	I don't know for a fact this is what it is.
2740361	2747186	249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.
2747746	2755312	So system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now, you have all those Wii remotes and... Go on the online shop and enjoy.
2755452	2757593	Yeah, nunchucks, done.
2757733	2762777	There you go, you've got a system, you're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.
2764459	2775653	299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then additional Wii Remote Plus and an Unchuck, kind of like the Wii had.
2776414	2779277	I bet it's going to be that other controller, the Xbox-y controller.
2779998	2782061	They'll throw that in, and I think that...
2783304	2784606	You give yours and then I'll give mine.
2784626	2785006	Never mind.
2785106	2785466	I'll shut up.
2785526	2794935	And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the GamePad controller, the Wii Remote Plus, the Nunchuck, and another pack-in game.
2795035	2797738	Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land.
2798439	2802823	It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.
2804060	2804721	Here's my guess.
2804861	2808243	I could be completely wrong, but I'm going to throw it out there.
2808263	2810345	$249.99, Bare Bones System.
2810625	2812066	$299, that's the one that's going to come.
2812126	2817491	Bare Bones System, Classic Controller Pro, or whatever that thing is called, and Nintendo Land.
2817791	2819792	I say you get the pack-in game at $299.
2820413	2828299	$349 will be, it will still have Nintendo Land, but it will not have the Classic Controller Pro.
2828659	2832042	Instead, it's going to have two Wii U tablets for all the games that don't use them.
2832542	2833984	700 bucks, blow up Miyamoto doll
2853723	2860926	Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September.
2861026	2862347	But there are the price points.
2862467	2865068	Release date is probably going to be the 18th of November.
2865148	2869450	So, hey, you figured it out two months before they're going to actually announce it.
2872122	2872923	So that's that.
2873283	2874403	I think it's somewhat reasonable.
2874423	2878526	Yeah, actually $249 is kind of lower than what I thought.
2878586	2888772	Not going to get one still, but it's... Has Nintendo launched with multiple SKUs like that since the original NES, which also came in three SKUs, funny enough?
2890314	2891075	I don't think so.
2893117	2893678	So, no.
2894800	2904473	And that's all I know of right now is that they've got three price points because that's what they want projections on unless they're shopping price points and seeing, okay, how many of this one are we going to sell?
2904493	2904954	How many of this one?
2905294	2908076	I don't think that they're like, we don't know what to charge for this.
2909377	2912240	$349 is way too much, I think, for the system to be out right now.
2912580	2922248	The thing that's going to be interesting, though, is that gives Microsoft and Sony enough time to where I think they could drop their console price again by the time that comes out.
2922348	2924169	And $249 would not be that much of a stretch.
2924189	2925711	That's another $50 price point.
2926451	2928533	I think it's another $50 drop.
2928633	2930114	Or are they $199, $299?
2930354	2931235	I can't remember right now.
2931936	2932276	They may be $199, $299.
2935661	2937782	or it could be onboard storage.
2938522	2940643	This system has more storage than this system.
2941503	2944924	Although, I mean, I wouldn't pay $50 more for onboard storage.
2944944	2945784	The Apple approach?
2946464	2947925	I don't know if they're going to do that.
2950466	2951006	Interesting.
2951226	2954507	I don't know.
2954807	2961129	We'll find out soon enough what they're going to be throwing in there and when it will be available.
2961209	2965010	But we have a pretty good hunch of what might be in there and when it might be available.
2966004	2967244	Did you talk about the online part yet?
2967484	2968085	Nope.
2968245	2969305	Online is going to be free.
2969585	2975427	And thank God, too, because like we've seen so far, we have no fucking clue what they're doing online.
2975527	2977567	So yeah, free sounds good.
2978048	2983129	I mean, because honestly, I haven't seen anything offered on it that was anything more than what's on the Wii.
2983789	2987430	Aside from, hey, now you can put forum posts on games and stuff.
2988231	2988651	You know, which...
2989691	2990132	Hooray?
2990152	2991092	I don't know.
2991913	3001481	Do you think they might go the route that PlayStation Plus went where, yeah, it's free, but maybe if you do give us money, we'll give you little freebies?
3001821	3006545	Because certainly there's enough of a back catalog of virtual console crap that they could give that shit out like candy.
3007866	3011208	They could do that, but I don't think they're organized well enough to do that right now.
3011268	3012829	That may be something that comes way later on.
3012929	3016892	I just think they're too late to... Something is not in the show world tonight.
3017072	3023176	I know they made a major hire this week with somebody from Disney Studios is in charge of their online now.
3024707	3030190	Disney had that unique thing that they did a while back where it was D Gamer or something like that.
3030951	3033292	It was kind of like their online hub thing.
3033312	3041577	They had avatars and stuff like that, and it was tied in with their DS Disney games, which probably no one remembers any of that stuff.
3043098	3046080	That was kind of cool and the offerings that they had in there were pretty cool.
3046500	3051863	But I hope they don't go that route because it was really stupid.
3051903	3057906	Doesn't Disney also have some fairly popular online games like Club Penguin I know is a pretty big deal.
3058566	3060367	And then like Pirates of the Caribbean.
3060467	3067991	I know their games are really big on having the phrases already there and you can only pick from those phrases to communicate with.
3068071	3069612	Like you can't type in your own stuff.
3070072	3070953	At least to keep it safe.
3073876	3074216	Cool.
3077260	3083667	Once again, I don't want to have this so chopped off at the balls, I guess, where it's...
3085521	3087423	Why would I want to buy a brand?
3087443	3094909	First off, why am I going to buy a brand new system that basically is as graphically powerful as my current Xbox 360?
3095330	3099614	Yeah, it may edge it out a little bit, but I don't think they're going to be really utilizing that.
3099634	3105959	I don't think you're going to see games on a Wii U right now that are going to be like, wow, that looks so much better than the Xbox 360 version.
3105979	3106720	You're not going to see that.
3108009	3111131	Actdeft brings up another good point in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
3111151	3114133	It says, Where's My Water is pretty awesome.
3114293	3114753	And that's right.
3114793	3115654	That reminded me.
3115694	3116154	I forgot.
3116234	3119997	Disney does have a pretty big footprint in the iOS app universe right now as well.
3120997	3127242	With that Nintendo thing being a tablet where you can be able to play games on it, that seems like an interesting little connection as well.
3128322	3130704	Because obviously Disney has the Where's My Water.
3130764	3132045	They have a couple other games too.
3132645	3134767	I know they own the TapTap brand now too.
3134807	3135407	That's all Disney.
3137348	3140911	I just, I don't know, I don't have very high expectations for them.
3141191	3150998	They're also supposed to be in September, they're supposed to be talking about 2013 titles for the Wii U, which honestly, I think that's, it's too, it's too early to be talking stuff for next year.
3151038	3153940	Is this the Parallel Tokyo Game Show conference they'll do?
3153960	3159404	I don't know, it's another one of their, like, five billion press conferences that I don't fucking care about because...
3160024	3187929	Like, seriously, just get all your shit out at one time, not this, well, today we're gonna talk about the first three digits of the price, and then maybe we'll have another press conference to talk about the last few digits, and then we're gonna give you the day of the week that the system's coming out, this press conference, and then the next we'll talk about which month it's coming out, and then maybe the hour or another, I mean, seriously, they waste so much fucking time with this stuff.
3189529	3203549	I mean, that's fine People keep talking about it They're like, hey, people keep covering our press conferences That's how you do it Yeah, but people keep covering it because they're like, wow, you didn't really announce anything That's fantastic that you didn't announce anything Very important
3204096	3209118	Well, you know, when there's not a lot of gaming news, you know, that's a great time to have a press conference.
3209498	3212499	Or it's a great time to report on people's Twitter activity.
3214039	3219501	And that's what I want to talk about here is game director Katsuhiro Harada.
3219721	3221982	He is the director of Tekken.
3222802	3226704	And he posted a very interesting rant this week on Twitter.
3227084	3233046	Now, I always thought Twitter was restricted to 140 characters, but he wrote a whole little essay on there thanks to...
3233666	3238109	TwitLonger, which apparently is a thing, twitlonger.com.
3238469	3246134	And he put this whole little rant about people who constantly tell him, switch back to the voice actors used previously.
3246995	3248556	I guess he's pretty pissed off about it.
3248616	3252719	He said in this, I'm going to quote some parts of this rant here on TwitLonger.
3253399	3254520	Quote, Quote, Quote,
3283596	3291759	Some might just say, just pay them to reuse the voice data, but often the voice actors decline this, or their agency declines.
3292599	3295600	Even so, some people said it is a different voice in Tekken 6 than the original.
3309844	3310625	It can't be helped.
3310645	3311585	They might think that.
3311825	3314987	Then he goes on to talk about the whole conversion process and so forth.
3316748	3317649	But I love this.
3317769	3326274	He says at the very end of this, he says, quote, After this lengthy explanation, I will be quite surprised if there are still people who still don't get it.
3326854	3329195	Thanks for understanding or not understanding.
3329435	3329876	Whatever.
3330516	3331256	Bro, you mad?
3332137	3332857	You real mad.
3333677	3335258	I guess this is starting to get to him.
3335578	3337839	But I can see where he's annoyed.
3338479	3340860	I can see where the fandom is like, don't change it.
3340900	3341480	It's perfect.
3341500	3342660	Don't change it.
3342940	3344141	Tekken 6 sucks.
3344221	3344881	I want Tekken 1.
3345241	3346242	I want the voice from Tekken 1.
3346502	3347662	But he does make a good point.
3348222	3350883	You have to license those voices every time.
3351003	3351904	And sometimes they say no.
3353044	3356928	I was going to say, voice actors can step out on a green light to cross the street and get hit by a bus.
3357449	3358370	What are you going to do?
3358390	3359171	People die.
3359191	3359991	I mean, what do they want?
3360031	3361353	You have to find replacements sometimes.
3361593	3366178	And honestly, if you like the voice acting better in Tekken 2, go play Tekken 2.
3368140	3373526	That's a good point, but I think the problem is too many people are playing Tekken 2 and not enough are playing Tekken 6.
3374407	3375488	Tekken 3 was the best.
3376563	3377904	Oh wait, here's another great quote.
3378884	3384907	I have even complied to the request of you all spamming me to bring back characters from previous installments.
3385407	3393430	You often say, let's show the dev team how sincere we are by buying two copies if they bring back character X. But did you really go through with it?
3393810	3397752	Expecting you to at least pre-order the game, I was met with more spam.
3398272	3402694	After you apparently didn't notice that June and Michelle actually returned.
3403374	3409860	I still have some characters left to be revealed that will comply with some of your requests, even bringing back several others.
3410321	3412523	Even so, none of them are paid DLC.
3412943	3416607	I will continue to sincerely comply with fan requests.
3417007	3427257	However, I can't continue to engage the negative ones that, without knowing what you are talking about or even thinking about when you're saying blindly repeat, bring back, bring back, bring back.
3427797	3428698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3443554	3446316	I kind of wish more people would tell off their fan bases.
3448117	3452779	That rant kind of makes me want to give Tekken 6 another chance, because we did try playing it, and it was kind of booby.
3453460	3454060	I didn't care for it.
3454200	3454820	Was that 5 or 6?
3455180	3455421	Wasn't it 6?
3455621	3456741	I guess, I don't know.
3457061	3457502	It was 6.
3457742	3458622	I've lost count.
3459163	3459683	It was 6.
3459763	3461864	I only had it via Gamefly for a day, but yeah, it was probably 6.
3467367	3467827	Anyway.
3468348	3470269	Alright, let's move on with some other news.
3470349	3472730	DarkSakura, we need to stop reporting on Twitter activity.
3473940	3480945	Okay, well, if it's any surprise, this is about Mass Effect 3, which no one's surprised, especially Rob, because he gave me the story.
3481165	3481506	Thank you.
3482727	3487110	Yeah, the Extended Cut DLC was out, and everybody is happy.
3487230	3488431	Well, okay, not everyone's happy.
3488451	3496897	There's still some people who are like, meh, which I had to stop myself from watching it, even though I watched some of it.
3497638	3497818	Okay.
3498280	3503685	Okay, so going forward, they're actually talking about already doing more download content that they're working on it right now.
3504666	3516937	So it was teased in a tweet that in regards to more download content, it said, that's a trick question, we'll save the future DLC for future chats.
3517077	3518838	Don't worry though, there's much more.
3520920	3527664	Mass Effect 2 had a DLC cycle that was a year and a half because Arrival came out I think March or April of 2011.
3528084	3529225	I think so.
3529245	3540791	It was a 2010 game, Mass Effect 2, so yeah, they need to, you know, DLC for the multiplayer would be nice and then what happens to Omega with Aria and there's definitely campaigns they can add.
3542051	3543332	I really hope the Omega thing.
3543672	3544873	I'd love to see more Aria.
3545573	3548595	I really hope they got Carrie Ann Moss to do additional dialogue so they could do that.
3548615	3549155	That would be great.
3549884	3557150	Well, given that I've only done a little bit in Mass Effect 2 of going to Omega, yeah.
3557690	3569160	So anyway, I kind of, I mean, I won't have much more of an opinion until I get into Mass Effect 3, but there's little side characters that I kind of liked that I wouldn't mind...
3569628	3571530	I'm all about extending the game's life with DLC.
3597731	3600332	BioWare said, they're not changing the ending.
3600752	3603872	They're going to just give you further details on the ending they made.
3604112	3605433	That's exactly what they did.
3605473	3606773	Although I understand they changed one thing.
3607353	3610934	There is one, well... They added something.
3611074	3618375	They added a big something that some people say is a giant F you to the fan base, and I say, deal with it.
3619455	3620176	I thought it was great.
3621136	3626737	And they did change some other things that they got called out by continuity cops.
3627569	3637345	Yeah, so apparently my big thing of wondering, this is just what was cleared up for me, that my big thing of wondering what are all of those Turians going to eat got fixed.
3638848	3639989	So I feel happy about that.
3641343	3643365	They made some stuff very clear.
3644006	3644586	Very clear.
3644666	3648550	Yeah, and as far as them adding details, it was a lot of details.
3649030	3654335	I think it left enough people satisfied that the people that are still furious about it are being brats.
3655036	3659040	But the content that we got on Tuesday should have been in it from day one.
3659100	3663224	It's not that spectacular where we can go, look, dipshits, it wasn't that hard.
3663644	3664225	This is good.
3664265	3665566	This should have been in the original product.
3665766	3680394	that's kind of the consensus overall that I'm getting from most people is that I'm happy with this I wish it had been this way the first time and if it had been there probably wouldn't have been as much butthurt and I'm okay with that for me it will be in it the first time there you go
3680834	3696912	and you know I think a lot of fans patience is a virtue a lot of fans should realize there are a lot of people like Jamie that still haven't played the entire series and you know Mass Effect will continue to kind of grow in the fans and so forth I will say this because this isn't really a spoiler
3697632	3706156	One thing I noticed they did add at the very, very, very end after the credits and after everything is they put a little pop-up message that says, you know, thank you for playing Mass Effect.
3706757	3711699	We really appreciate all your feedback and your comment, you know, kind of the PC thing they have to say, over the years.
3712199	3714020	And we hope you've enjoyed Mass Effect 3.
3714601	3719283	We can't wait to, you know, see you for whatever Mass Effect has in store next type of thing.
3719323	3723505	So they do basically say, this is not the last Mass Effect.
3723925	3726767	They don't say Mass Effect 4, but they basically say...
3727287	3729409	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3755468	3758050	Well, Arrival is also truly a bridge between 2 and 3.
3758610	3760391	And it was the very last DLC to come out.
3760411	3764433	Mass Effect 3 starts immediately referencing what happens to Shepard in Arrival.
3765413	3766314	See, that's what I had heard.
3766474	3769555	And so that's why I thought, okay, that's good.
3769855	3772016	I mean, it's all stuff that ties right back in.
3772056	3773637	So I'm pretty happy.
3773737	3776599	I mean, I get to play through Mass Effect 3 with the true ending.
3777619	3779140	I mean, in my head.
3779200	3781501	You'll never experience that hurt again.
3782765	3785890	Keep in mind that some of it got spoiled for me.
3786310	3789575	I'm going to punch you so you can experience some of the hurt.
3790399	3791260	That's okay, Rob.
3791400	3792860	I'm fine with not being punched.
3792960	3795062	All right.
3795322	3800865	Vandy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, referencing something you brought up earlier, Mass Effect MMO.
3801525	3802086	Who knows?
3802446	3806388	I would quit WoW in a second for a Mass Effect MMO.
3806728	3810630	I don't think it's in the cards for BioWare after what's happened to Star Wars.
3811331	3818055	I mean, if Star Wars can somehow be salvaged, maybe, but... It should just be converted into Mass Effect MMO.
3818915	3819216	No!
3819496	3820337	No, it should not.
3821279	3822480	They can do better, even better.
3822520	3826606	Well, I meant take the base engine and futz with it some.
3826874	3828154	Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
3828194	3828435	Loki.
3829195	3829515	Alright.
3830635	3833916	So let's talk a little bit about the future.
3833977	3834817	And this is kind of cool.
3835837	3841359	MercurySteam, the team behind the Lords of Shadows game.
3841499	3843020	Yeah, it's part of Castlevania.
3843440	3846741	Because, you know, they didn't think it could stand on its own.
3848161	3851303	They're ready to basically call it...
3852683	3857604	move on from the Castlevania franchise after the new 3DS game and Lords of Shadow 2.
3858824	3867606	They said, well, I think it's about wanting to leave a legacy, and I don't want to be in charge of a series that perhaps over a certain time is going to decline.
3867986	3872067	I'd rather go out with a bang and leave our legacy in the Castlevania universe.
3872967	3877928	And then, of course, they also said they don't want to be known as Mr. Castlevania, and...
3880605	3886728	Should Lords of Shadow 2 be very successful, they'd have another team do a sequel.
3887468	3892610	Of course they were teasing that perhaps Contra is the next series that they will work on.
3893783	3894363	That'd be pretty cool.
3894543	3895084	New Contra game.
3895424	3896785	I'd like to see Contra make a comeback.
3897345	3898526	Contra should make a comeback.
3899427	3903089	But it's one of those games, like, it could easily be so fucked up.
3903549	3905630	Like, they could really botch it bad.
3906111	3907512	But, I mean, you know.
3907532	3907892	What was it?
3909113	3910233	Was it Contra?
3910493	3913255	Would they call it on the Xbox Live Arcade one, the anime?
3913535	3914716	Oh, Hardcore Uprising.
3914776	3915536	Yeah, Hardcore Uprising.
3915557	3916497	That was pretty rad.
3917338	3917878	I liked that one.
3919750	3923214	So, even though that wasn't really Contra, but it was.
3923414	3924295	Well, yeah.
3924756	3927279	I mean, Hardcore Uprising is basically Contra.
3927719	3928881	I think it did have some of the music.
3930703	3939954	Anyway, if you like that anime-style look to Hardcore Uprising and some of those other online games, maybe you are an anime fan.
3940314	3946179	And maybe you'll be excited to hear that Viz Media is launching a subscription-based service called Neon Alley.
3946559	3948560	And it's going to be on consoles this fall.
3948941	3950822	It's a 24-hour anime network.
3951863	3958508	Viz Media is the localization company that did stuff like Bleach, Naruto, and a lot of similar things.
3958528	3959809	Taking it way back, they did Ranma.
3960029	3962511	Yeah, so they brought all that stateside.
3962932	3965794	They've already said it's going to cost $6.99 a month.
3966214	3973320	It will not be an on-demand streaming app, which I find kind of strange because people are paying for it, but I guess they're taking the HBO approach.
3973981	3983068	It will be an actual TV channel with schedules and all that stuff, uncensored content, HD, but it will always be dubbed in English.
3984089	3985170	I don't care anymore.
3988684	3989585	This is the other thing.
3990505	3994929	There will be advertisements even though there is a subscription fee.
3995309	3998531	The ads will be limited and they're there to keep the cost below $10.
3999232	4001613	Some of the programming coming to the channel.
4001974	4005757	Naruto Shippuden, Inuyasha, The Final Act, Death Note.
4006957	4009719	Those are all coming to this network.
4010179	4022885	But they don't say exactly what consoles or how, but I guess we're left to assume it would be very easy for it to be a PlayStation 3 app akin to the Netflix or Hulu Plus or Vudu or any of that stuff.
4023785	4050156	and then we have on the Xbox 360 obviously those content channels are very easy to make and we've seen a lot of those so it'll be a Comcast-esque style channel still very interesting because I can't think of any other on-demand channel that's run like an old-school TV network that's only available on a game console very interesting interesting to see what could be in the future
4051616	4051977	You know what?
4052097	4055159	I'm still going to stick with fansubs.
4055359	4057640	Would you pay $6.99 a month for VOG TV?
4059541	4062002	Well, yeah, because we're far superior.
4062523	4063803	And we'll play it in Japanese.
4063844	4064364	I don't care.
4066445	4071928	I know you would think if it's all online, it would be super easy to just have one channel in English and one in Japanese.
4071988	4074270	That seems, you know, that's weird.
4074290	4075210	I don't like Laserdisc.
4075270	4076671	Play it in digital or analog.
4077211	4078512	Exactly, I think.
4080729	4082110	Alan, I know you're in anime.
4082150	4084431	In fact, you know way more about it than I do.
4084471	4084932	I used to be.
4085432	4093876	You used to be, but you... Okay, just the other day, I'm telling this on air, we were at a Sanrio store and there was a Sailor Moon backpack and you pointed at it.
4095277	4104182	Yeah, because it reminds me of when I was 17 and not quite out yet, but clearly gay and Sailor Moon was awesome.
4105751	4106231	It's pretty.
4106311	4106731	You know what?
4107012	4110093	We should just marathon the entire thing from beginning to end.
4111033	4115875	I need to convert my awesome fan subs of the last three seasons I have on tape to something digital.
4116916	4118076	I've got rips of them.
4119817	4120457	Yeah, Rob.
4120938	4125359	Would you pay $6.99 a month for this anime TV with commercials in English only?
4125579	4131302	Given that I haven't really watched anime with any type of seriousness in like 10 years, no, but...
4133502	4135764	From 98 to about 2003, fuck yeah.
4136004	4144610	I just remembered what the last series I actually paid to have shipped to me from fansubbed was, on tape, was Mamote Shugogeten.
4146211	4147012	Was it worth it?
4147652	4156979	Well, I had watched a lot of it raw, because a friend of mine taped some off the TV for me, and then I watched most of it, and then it came out in the US, and I was like, well, crap.
4157501	4159142	I hardly ever watch anime.
4160043	4164466	I think the last one I watched, seriously, was a vampire.
4164846	4165527	Was it Helsing?
4166107	4166948	Helsing, maybe.
4166968	4168229	I think it was the last one I watched.
4168249	4172632	We watched that over at Jessica's Old Place after watching Shock Treatment.
4173272	4174473	Yeah, that sounds about right.
4174533	4176274	With the projector that Evan had hooked up.
4176755	4177495	I remember that.
4178156	4180117	I have boxes of Laserdiscs.
4183376	4200346	you know what we need to do have an anime convention but like not restricted to anime we need to just have a convention where it's like everybody just fucking show up here and we're gonna do awesome things and if you don't like it get the fuck out you know what I take that back you know what the last series I actually downloaded everything was Supernatural
4202077	4203417	Oh, because they have anime, yeah.
4203898	4205318	And it's done by Studio Madhouse.
4205418	4206238	It's an OVA, right?
4206278	4206819	It's like a miniseries?
4206839	4208939	No, it's like a whole season of stuff.
4209139	4211080	And the X-Men one, which was really good.
4211380	4212601	Because I think that was also Madhouse.
4213101	4213501	But anyway.
4214041	4215141	GTFO con.
4215361	4217022	If you don't like it, GTFO.
4217402	4219303	But be proud of me.
4219323	4220523	Be either proud or sad for me.
4221243	4229106	I broke out my Gatchaman episodes from 1972 and was like singing along with it because I will always sing along with the Gatchaman theme.
4229246	4230587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4254790	4258431	Well, there's a game that's been announced for PC, but it was originally a smartphone game.
4259251	4260271	It's called Death Rally.
4260851	4262132	It just has the best name ever.
4262912	4267873	So it's being rebuilt for the PC with a new engine, camera, new controls.
4269053	4272554	Well, of course, it's going to be new controls since it was a phone game before.
4273314	4279596	And it's going to have a new track and the Shadow Man from the 1996 version.
4280276	4282797	So you should see it on Steam for $10.
4284557	4285718	Death Rally Universal Healthcare
4301644	4306327	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates coming to a country near you.
4306667	4308248	Possibly Finnish release dates.
4308288	4309329	We might cover that in a minute.
4309369	4310289	But first, the U.S.
4310409	4311370	Did you know that's true though?
4311870	4316513	That as far as like international happiness level, Finland was rated number one.
4318314	4319936	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4340238	4340940	Don't do that.
4341000	4341862	This is awesome.
4342423	4344367	Very cool.
4344407	4347473	We had Fushigi Yugi like this for a while back in the day.
4347954	4349377	Every episode of Fushigi Yugi.
4350683	4352464	The Secret World, which is a new MMO being launched.
4352504	4354126	That's coming out on PC.
4354146	4355807	That looked interesting.
4355887	4356627	That could be the Jack.
4356667	4358549	And then Theaterhythm, Final Fantasy for the 3DS.
4372199	4373100	Thanks for watching!
4391380	4391701	Rhythm Thief
4403860	4404160	I don't know.
4405041	4406002	Chatters, what do you think?
4406543	4408024	Which of those games sounds more exciting?
4408084	4409486	Secret World or Theatrhythm?
4409746	4410127	I want to know.
4410888	4414592	Live.vognetwork.com Meanwhile, Japanese release dates.
4414672	4416194	Let's talk what's happening over there.
4416915	4419658	July 5th, a little more exciting in Japan.
4419738	4424003	On the Xbox 360, Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon gets a price reduction.
4425063	4427805	Max Anarchy is a new game from Sega coming out on the 360.
4428285	4432587	And there's also Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier comes out in Japan as well.
4432687	4434788	Yeah, I really wish I was coming out over here.
4435248	4437289	Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns over here.
4437309	4438450	I was going to say, it's Anarchy Reigns, right?
4438470	4440331	Yeah, I got delayed next year.
4441271	4442132	Oh, wow, really?
4442352	4442552	Yeah.
4442772	4446354	So you're going to have to import it, I guess, if you want to play it.
4446874	4453498	Because it is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week, which, as you know, PS3 is a region free, so if you really wanted to play it, you could.
4454278	4462722	Other games out on the PS3 this week, Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Tactical Assault Commander 3 gets a price reduction, or it's, I guess, the camouflage version?
4462782	4463243	Oh, no, that's $129.
4463283	4463863	That's not a price reduction.
4466824	4490078	I don't know what that is oh this is a never mind you know what that is that's a freaking uh uh it's one of those little uh mech warrior mouse slash number pad slash draw it's one of these things look it's one of those it's not a game it's a peripheral that has the mouse but it's for the ps3 which is interesting so it's definitely for um more tactical based strategy games
4491299	4519078	Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City get price reductions in Japan this week as they are released into the PS3 The Best Collection looking at the handhelds real quick on the Vita you have a game called Dokuro comes out this week I do not know I'm trying to think what this game is over here I thought I saw a preview for this and I can't think of what this is called over here I've seen this somewhere yeah
4520700	4522701	Nightmare Before Christmas Nightmare Before Christmas
4545270	4571026	Lastly, on the 3DS this week, there are some more peripherals, but as far as games go, we have Sekaiju no Meikyuu 4 Denshu no Kaioujin comes out this week, and that is a game where you make your own character and set up a team of explorers and go through labyrinths.
4571354	4572455	Hey Rob, it's an anime.
4573295	4573495	Is it?
4574216	4575817	Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan.
4576397	4576978	Oh, thank you.
4577118	4578218	Dokuro means skull.
4578439	4582701	Maybe that's why it looks familiar, is that like I've seen like a cartoon version or something on YouTube.
4583542	4590346	Alright, and lastly on the 3DS this week, Danball Senkai Baku Boost comes out this week from level 5.
4590586	4593128	This is, I believe it's... I think it means skull.
4595433	4623398	On the 3rd, The Secret World And on the 4th, Rainbow Moon, which makes me now think of Sailor Moon Thank you, Alan On the 6th, we have Beat the Beat, Rhythm Paradise Test Drive, Ferrari Racing Legends And Theatrhythm, Final Fantasy
4626936	4650942	Some feedback on the release dates from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Stan says, I want to play Max Anarchy Bayonetta's in it S is the guy from Mad World He's one of the main characters in it In fact, I think a lot of the characters from Mad World are in there I want to say a lot of the villains are It looks interesting Why isn't Bayonetta 2 already a thing that came out in Japan last year?
4651673	4652653	That's a great question.
4653134	4653974	Why is that not a thing?
4654054	4657956	It's because the developer probably wants to make it, but I don't think it was profitable.
4658196	4662777	I mean, it was somewhat profitable, but it's still a niche title, but I think that they totally would do that.
4663118	4665779	Because it's the guy who left Capcom Platinum Games.
4665839	4668620	It's his studio that made it, and they're working on something else big now.
4669160	4669840	Metal Gear Rising.
4670280	4671521	Okay, yeah.
4672972	4674133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4692944	4695947	Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC just came out this week and apparently it is really buggy
4713280	4722203	A bunch of the PC users have kind of gathered on the Ubisoft forums and made a bug report for them.
4724383	4728264	Letting them know, you know, what exactly the issues are.
4728844	4735406	And, you know, apparently it ranges from everything that, you know,
4737612	4744155	I don't know.
4744735	4748157	It's just kind of bad, I guess.
4750138	4750398	I don't know.
4750418	4751338	I'm not much of a PC player.
4751478	4754800	I would have thought, though, they took the extra time to get the PC version right.
4754900	4760783	I mean, because this game came out back in May, and the PC version not until the end of June.
4761083	4765665	And so now they just kind of, eh.
4768058	4768338	I don't know.
4769119	4770019	Test your shit.
4770499	4771420	I mean, seriously.
4772940	4774901	They literally have broken it down.
4775361	4776042	They've broken it down.
4776122	4784225	Hardware compatibility, input, FPS resolution, graphic issues in game, online, audio, menus, and other.
4785166	4791649	Why is it that these companies treat gamers like they're beta testers and not like they're fucking...
4793061	4794321	You know, customers.
4794882	4795862	I mean, that's stupid.
4796282	4797302	Because we let them.
4797482	4798443	We pre-order anyway.
4798483	4800463	We didn't know those tires fell off of the car.
4800483	4804604	I mean, if we had driven it, we would have surely noticed that that was the case.
4805264	4806965	Your steering wheel only turns to the left.
4807365	4810026	Well, that's unfortunate.
4810066	4813427	Thankfully, our track, you know, we turned to the left.
4813567	4814707	And so, yeah, that's.
4817672	4829999	Well, now we talked a little bit before about anime, and I may not be the biggest anime fan in the world, I mean, it's alright, but one thing I do love is I love the stuff that comes from Miyazaki and all that stuff.
4830439	4839804	So you know I'm looking forward to Ni no Kuni, which is the, or I guess that's already out in Japan actually, but the English translation is coming out soon.
4840004	4851097	Finally, soon, and in Europe, there is going to be a Wizards edition that comes out, and it's going to have a copy of what's called the Wizards Companion, which is the spellbook used in game.
4851498	4852939	There's a Drippy doll.
4853300	4854241	It doesn't actually drip.
4854301	4856123	Drippy is the little character that comes with it.
4856744	4859247	You get some other DLC stuff with this.
4860328	4863991	And that will be out when the game comes out on January 25th.
4864131	4867414	And some good news, it was announced for North America shortly afterwards.
4867774	4875581	However, you can only get it on Namco's online shop at store.namcobandaigames.com It will set you back $99.99.
4877102	4879865	But I gotta say, looks pretty awesome.
4879925	4881286	I'm really looking forward to this game.
4881386	4884248	So that's one I'll be playing early next year for sure.
4884369	4884809	Ni no kuni.
4884889	4889213	I think I'm sort of past that phase where I'm buying special editions of just about everything.
4889373	4890194	Yeah, me too.
4890234	4892016	And I hate the DLC stuff.
4892156	4902806	I think my burn phase was when I bought the Cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast, paid 90 bucks for a plate and a clock and a fork and a spoon.
4903687	4904288	And a pillowcase.
4904888	4910692	If the collector's edition is $10 more or $20 maybe tops and it's a series I really love, then maybe.
4911252	4913734	But you are asking me to take a big risk here on Ni No Kune.
4914214	4917716	Sometimes this collector's edition kind of bombed too, like the Tron video game.
4918076	4920077	I see this collector's edition still on clearance.
4920117	4923219	It's been almost, it's been what, a year and a half since the movie and the game?
4923780	4926741	So people are still trying to unload those collector's editions.
4927002	4929203	Even popular ones like Halo Reach and stuff.
4929761	4930282	That's true.
4930482	4931303	A ton of those.
4931323	4931643	Yeah.
4931983	4932344	All right.
4932844	4935968	Well, let's go back to a time when things were simpler.
4937249	4944697	And we didn't have $400 collector's editions of games or games that come with leather jackets, which I think was a thing a couple weeks ago.
4946271	4946551	DarkSakura.com
4967369	4969010	Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.
4969030	4970852	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4971032	4972413	Ninja Gaiden for the NES.
4972873	4974794	Specifically, the NES version.
4975514	4977696	It's hard as fuck.
4978897	4983299	In Japan, it was called Ninja Ryukenden, which is Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword.
4983920	4988062	And in Europe, it was Shadow Warriors because there was this big taboo about using the word ninja.
4988443	4992505	For example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles over there.
4993726	4994126	There you go.
4994326	4994907	I know my stuff.
4995806	5002029	So, it was a little platformer where you beat people up and chopped them in half with your sword.
5002950	5006611	And it was ported to the PC Engine.
5007572	5008632	Actually, let me start back.
5009173	5011454	It came out in December 1988 in Japan, March 1989 in North America.
5014315	5016096	and September 1991 in Europe.
5017057	5025363	There was a PC Engine version in 1992 and a Super NES version as part of the Ninja Gaiden trilogy in 1995.
5025824	5028365	And there's been mobile phone versions with episodic content.
5029026	5031007	And it's now on the Virtual Console as of 2007.
5033104	5046650	So you play as Ryu Hayabusa, who we might also know from Dead or Alive and the current Ninja Gaiden games.
5047610	5054894	So he's learned that someone named the Jackio plans to take control of the world by using demon power.
5054914	5055054	Ooh.
5055794	5059697	So you have to go through, and you go through all the different acts, and you have 20 levels, and it's hard.
5060358	5061519	Hard, hard, hard, hard.
5062820	5074170	More than that, the big thing is that it had such an elaborate story, and used cinematic cutscenes, you know, as far as an 8-bit system could handle.
5074670	5077112	Which were epic as fuck at the time.
5077252	5077893	Yes, they were.
5077913	5079114	Seriously, seriously.
5080635	5088038	And it even had a novelization done in... Oh, it was one of the FX9 books, wasn't it?
5088178	5089479	Yeah, The Worlds of Power.
5089719	5090619	Oh, that's right.
5091580	5094141	And he actually kind of had something to write off of.
5094521	5101444	He had to just make shit up for games like Simon's Quest, where the story for Simon's Quest was really strange.
5101784	5105386	But yeah, he actually was able to keep the Ninja Gaiden one pretty close to the cinematics.
5105680	5106080	Yeah.
5106860	5110222	So, I mean, basically, it's just, it's super hard.
5110262	5113023	Like, this is a game I haven't beaten.
5113503	5129549	You know, you can use shuriken, you can use your spiritual strength power, you also get shuriken that work like boomerangs, you get different types of things that will freeze your enemies, the fire wheels, you know, all kinds of neat stuff.
5129909	5131130	And even with that, no one can beat it.
5131410	5132390	Sorry, it's impossible.
5132610	5133211	Just won't happen.
5134776	5135982	I know people who have beaten it.
5136224	5137430	But I don't think Dan's beaten it.
5138430	5167148	I've gotten to the last fucking stage and there's a jump that is so hard like it was controller throwing, rage inducing Alan knows what I'm like when I'm mad and that was one of them that made me mad it's like you would jump if anyone wants to see the best rendition of how every gamer feels playing this game look at the Angry Video Game Nerds little video about this game that is everybody playing this game
5167928	5176731	My one difficult NES game triumph is that I beat the original Ninja Turtles NES game, which also has a rep for being hard as hell, even though it's an American-made game.
5177091	5181813	I beat that twice, and all the other times I couldn't get past the final boss, but yeah.
5182453	5185254	And Ninja Gaiden is harder than that, so that's some scary shit.
5185922	5196006	Well, it was developed by Tecmo, and another series back in the day that Tecmo did was Rygar, which I don't know if I've done on Classic Game before, but Rygar is a pretty good game.
5197186	5198047	Of course, Tecmo Bowl.
5200527	5209531	So, this one also had an arcade version that was a beat-em-up, but they weren't really ports of each other, they were kind of different.
5210491	5220274	And the developer said that the term ninja was gaining popularity in North America, so that's why they made the game with the ninja.
5221194	5230757	And actually, the NES version was developed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who was listed as Sakurazaki in the credits.
5231877	5238539	So you can see that if you look at the arcade credits and the NES credits, completely different development teams.
5240040	5246744	So, basically, that's where the differences came in with the two versions.
5246804	5256631	So, it's just really supposed to be more like you're playing a manga, is what they were going for.
5257051	5262235	That you were involved in the story of the game as well as playing the game itself.
5263866	5273333	So, because the game's title was actually too difficult for English audiences, that's why they changed it to Ninja Gaiden.
5274914	5279117	And they were going to call it Dragon Ninja, but Ninja Gaiden just worked.
5279198	5281139	And it actually literally means Ninja Side Story.
5282140	5285602	But it's not intended to be a spin-off of the arcade version.
5285943	5287123	God, I remember these bosses.
5287143	5288464	Some of them were hard as fuck.
5288925	5292047	The first two were like easy mode, but then the third one is like, ah.
5292828	5293028	Sorry.
5294739	5296501	Super Nintendo Compilation
5315373	5319816	Well, this game had so much featuring in Nintendo Power in 89 and 90.
5320597	5325280	It was on the March-April 89 cover and referenced in Howard and Esther.
5326160	5329062	I used to read a bunch of Howard and Esther.
5329423	5329883	Just saying.
5331611	5336394	And it was also in the May-June 1989 issue.
5336414	5339075	It had complete walkthroughs.
5339135	5340836	There was stuff in the Counselor's Corner.
5341277	5347620	It debuted number three in the top 30 list for July and August in 89, just behind Zelda 2 and Super Mario 2.
5347920	5348621	You know what they need?
5349401	5350242	Reg and Nestor.
5353323	5353543	No.
5353944	5354484	Just sayin'.
5356212	5369283	So, I mean, basically, going back from this in 2004, Tecmo did episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for the AT&T and Verizon phones that used the Brew and Java platform.
5370484	5376289	And the second installment was going to be released in North America, and it just didn't come out.
5376689	5377690	They didn't keep up with it.
5379717	5394734	and um you know that magazine that Dan and I are into Retro Gamer which is a UK magazine um they did a review um and a look back on Ninja Gaiden in uh the March 2004 issue when the 2004 Xbox remake came out so I mean
5395254	5397215	This game has really spawned a legacy.
5397395	5411378	It gave us, you know, you keep going and it's given us, like, we have characters that are alive, we've had, and going from that we've got the newer versions, which some are good and some are not, and the big glowing red scarf.
5412398	5414899	And there's also soundtracks.
5415599	5416539	You can get the soundtracks.
5416619	5417999	The first one came out in 1989.
5418879	5419320	So there you go.
5422403	5425624	There it is, your classic game of the week, a real classic, Ninja Gaiden.
5426104	5430465	On the NES, not to be confused with the arcade version, which I personally did not care for nearly as much.
5430485	5432485	It was just too different, as you touched on there.
5433286	5439547	But I seriously recommend to everybody, when we're done with the show, go watch the Angry Video Game Nerds version of this.
5439987	5440987	And then play Ninja Gaiden.
5441187	5441748	And then play it.
5441888	5442368	And play the sequel.
5442408	5442948	And then scream.
5443208	5443948	And play the third one.
5444448	5447849	Because the second one introduces the Shadow Ninjas, which weren't in the first one.
5448157	5453479	I would like to see how bloody knuckles people get from punching the wall while playing this game.
5454355	5457696	AcidicVampire in our chatroom says, Heard the most recent Ninja Gaiden is shit.
5457816	5459576	Yeah, that's what I heard too.
5459876	5463277	I tried not to get into the new series as much, but I hear they're hard too.
5463497	5464938	Is the latest one 3 or 2?
5465298	5465598	I think it's 3.
5467158	5471899	Because each one got released like 3 times with the Black Omega Ultra Hyper Edition.
5471939	5476520	Well, I remember it was a big deal because it was on Xbox.
5476560	5477460	The first Xbox.
5477721	5479161	It was a big deal.
5479941	5480161	All right.
5480201	5485722	Anyhow, we're going to take a break so we can do break-type things like refill our drinks and all that stuff.
5486042	5487022	But don't go anywhere.
5487062	5489583	There is plenty more to go when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.
5489603	5494684	We're going to have the Fugle Question of the Week, of course, your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, Rapid Fire News.
5495064	5496424	And you know what?
5497064	5502185	Last week, we didn't get to do any of our big segments because we were busy celebrating with the 10 years and everything.
5502485	5503965	So I think we should play a game tonight.
5504005	5508406	So we're going to do listless tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5508486	5509006	Stay tuned.
5515297	5518239	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5518339	5528104	We are live on this Sunday night, July the 1st of 2012 with the 463rd episode of our show taping live at vognetwork.com.
5528124	5530985	If you're just now joining us live, well, hello.
5531426	5535028	Come on by the chat room and say hi at live.vognetwork.com.
5536148	5551522	and if you're listening on the podcast I hope you didn't fall asleep when I was talking about podcast check-ins earlier because now you can get VOG points just for visiting vognetwork.com log it in and put in your password you might get some loot you might but we don't give away all the secrets on how to do that
5552122	5556224	We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here in the Fugle Question of the Week and all that good stuff.
5556244	5562868	But first, Alan, you're here on the show tonight, and I always like to let the guests plug things.
5563369	5567851	I know you don't run a website of your own or anything, but you do have something you do want to plug tonight, yes?
5568091	5570012	Yes, I'm selling off more video games.
5571353	5571934	eBay batch.
5572958	5581003	So I was selling off duplicates, now I'm selling off stuff that was once, you know, normally something I wouldn't part with, but makes some extra money.
5581063	5584925	No one's obligated to bid on it, but I thought the OL Army might want to see what I have up for grabs.
5585085	5586145	I'm going to put a link in chat.
5586686	5587026	Excellent.
5587126	5588167	So eBay games.
5588367	5590568	What kind of stuff are you selling, just to kind of give the impression?
5591087	5593628	Most... Almost entirely handheld stuff.
5593808	5596909	Game Boy Advance is the bulk of it.
5597950	5599270	Am I not coming through on audio?
5599430	5607174	No, it's just... The chat room, sometimes you guys send me mixed signals because... And you guys in studio, don't... You're like a psycho girlfriend.
5607194	5610355	I don't want to sound mean, but don't always take what chat says at face value.
5610495	5612736	Multiple people have to say it before it's an issue.
5613036	5617378	And then when you guys get in on it because one person's saying it in chat, I get really confused.
5617518	5619559	Two people have to say it in chat before it's really an issue.
5619939	5620439	Because like...
5620959	5621720	I don't know.
5623682	5625704	I can only see the little waveforms going here.
5625745	5627246	So I could tell Alan's mic was off.
5627567	5628087	And I'm sorry.
5628207	5630350	I ran away to turn on a light somewhere else.
5630370	5632172	So I didn't see that his stuff wasn't getting through.
5632772	5633353	Yeah, Rob.
5633433	5634875	But anyway, now we got it.
5634915	5637137	So I just totally ruined your plug.
5637778	5638479	But that's what I do.
5638779	5639780	I ruin your life.
5639840	5640521	That's my role.
5641982	5643664	So how do people find your auctions?
5643684	5645886	There's a link in chat right now.
5645946	5647928	It's a goo.goal link.
5648328	5657796	And also if you check the OLR Twitter feed, I don't know if you RT'd it, retweeted it, but if you check the Orange Sons Radio Twitter feed and just scroll down if you're a podcast listener listening to this, they end Thursday nights.
5657816	5658517	You've got four days.
5658997	5664858	I didn't retweet it on OLR because I was like, ooh, I shouldn't use the business thing for that, but it is on my personal Twitter.
5664878	5668039	I just retweeted it at twitter.com slash S-K-I-E.
5668099	5669680	Yeah, so check Sky's Twitter.
5670260	5671300	It should be a couple posts down.
5671900	5674661	Okay, awesome.
5674721	5676401	Do we get some of the games named already?
5676921	5678222	Sorry, I got confused with it.
5678242	5679322	Some of the games that you are selling?
5679622	5682163	Oh, I haven't listed any of them off, but let me do that real quick.
5682423	5684003	I wish you had told me about some of these first.
5685503	5686884	I would have just given you straight up cash.
5690766	5693148	Final Fantasy 5 and 6 Game Boy Advance.
5694108	5697150	Those are the ones that have extra maps and espers and job classes.
5699411	5701573	Advance Wars 1 and 2 bundled together.
5702493	5705355	Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Force Hordes, Game Boy Advance.
5705935	5707376	Final Fantasy 3 DS.
5708717	5710258	Final Fantasy 2 PSP.
5711218	5712479	Final Fantasy 4 DS.
5712759	5713660	Elite Beat Agents.
5714900	5738313	uh Super Smash Brothers Melee GameCube and Final Fantasy Legend 3 for Game Boy that game is 20 years old I didn't tell you to name them all goddamn I'm just kidding it's fine all right I got going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com rdgsing says do we get a discount if we mention OLR at the eBay checkout uh no and I have to make sure make make very clear this money is going to
5738653	5740615	Alan, this money is not going to OLR.
5740676	5742257	Yeah, this is not some VOG fundraiser.
5742277	5743459	This is me just selling games.
5744099	5746602	But he can plug his stuff because he's sitting here on the show tonight.
5746642	5747724	However, I will say this.
5748144	5751888	If you do mention OLR at checkout, we will throw in something small.
5752069	5754311	Like, we'll throw in something from the OLR vault here.
5754652	5756674	Just a something small little trinket.
5757094	5758916	Maybe an autographed picture of myself.
5759958	5782980	and I just want I'll give you something better I just want Acidic Vampire to know that Final Fantasy 6 is super awesome but I'm never gonna play a Game Boy Advance again and Final Fantasy 6 is available like for other different ways so plus I have a Super Nintendo sitting right over there and I'm pretty sure there's a Final Fantasy 3 cartridge somewhere which is a pretty decent way to play it yeah I realize it has the wrong number in front but you know what deal
5785427	5788910	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick news stories tonight.
5788950	5789251	Loki.
5789691	5799500	So this shouldn't come as much of a surprise since we were just talking about all the trouble with the PC version of Ghost Recon Future Soldier.
5799921	5805666	But yeah, Ghost Recon Arctic Strike, which was going to be the expansion for Future Soldier, has been delayed.
5806287	5808409	It's not coming out this week like it was going to.
5809049	5812371	Um, they're citing polish as the reason to hold it up.
5812751	5817453	Yes, the polish or, hey, let's not release it with a million bugs like we did with the PC version.
5819474	5820855	So, gotta have to wait.
5821515	5824036	Um, there's a new LEGO MMO coming.
5824777	5827098	Hopefully this one will last a little longer than the last one.
5827718	5855156	and it is coming from Funcom so they kind of know their way around an MMO and they haven't really said exactly what this MMO is going to be but they have some Lego minifigs online and it's going to be based on that franchise I didn't realize they had so many different Lego minifigs they actually have one with like bunny ears and stuff and a little red riding hood it's kind of crazy um
5857449	5862118	Family friendly game and it's going to be coming out at some point.
5864383	5865305	Lego minifigs.
5865826	5867630	Well, since it didn't work the last time.
5868935	5875478	And then last but not least, there is a big action movie coming out this summer.
5875998	5882801	It doesn't feature Batman, but it features a whole ton of 80s action stars, including Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff like that.
5882861	5888383	The Expendables 2, and it is coming out as a video game, which was kind of leaked out before.
5888443	5890704	I think it was on the Germans rating board and stuff like that.
5890764	5896406	But it is going to be a PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade game and PC game.
5897226	5900127	Coming out probably around the time of the movie.
5900247	5902027	It's a four-player co-op shooter.
5902967	5905828	I don't know.
5905848	5906268	It looks neat.
5906308	5913510	I'm trying to see if this is more of like a... I think this might be like an arcade-type game.
5914250	5917551	Like a time crisis or something like that.
5917955	5936362	and obviously it's based on the movie which I saw the trailer for not that long ago it's not like Time Crisis but it's like NOM it reminds me of the NOM game that they had on Neo Geo where you have your character run across the screen it's sort of a shooter but not do you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character?
5936622	5940443	I don't know if you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character seriously, fuck that guy
5943174	5943815	Valve
5965342	5967183	You want to make some more in-game movies?
5967463	5974188	Things in Team Fortress 2, which by the way, after last week where I was like, oh, I want to play some more first-person shooters and stuff.
5974228	5977930	I'm probably getting more recommendations for Team Fortress 2 than anything else, just so you guys know.
5977970	5980172	So I probably will have to check that out at some point.
5980192	5988517	But anyway, Team Fortress 2 is one of the games that you can make movies with now with the Valve Source Filmmaker.
5989478	5993241	I guess one of the videos they were showing off was this Meet the Pyro video.
5993361	5994562	I haven't watched this myself yet.
5994582	5995282	Yeah, it's a brand new one.
5995422	5996403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6012901	6013722	Garry's Mod Garry's Mod
6038479	6051704	So, anyhow, you can sign up for the filmmaker beta at www.sourcefilmmaker.com And I guess right now it's only really Team Fortress 2, but I'm assuming there will be other games later.
6051804	6054525	And plenty of fake Half-Life 3 trailers to hit the web soon.
6055125	6059827	Now, if you're more of a Portal fan, Jamie, maybe this is something that will interest you.
6059987	6061988	A Portal turret mini-replica.
6062850	6065051	Don't you want a turret in your house, DarkSakura?
6065271	6066651	You can get a blow-up turret.
6067032	6068472	Well, this is not a blow-up.
6068592	6071873	It is an actual mini-model of the Aperture Sentry turret.
6071933	6073894	It's a 16-inch tall.
6073954	6077155	This company, Gaming Heads, is only making 350 of them.
6077555	6082117	You can pre-order it right now for release in quarter four of 2012 for the low, low price of $330.
6082217	6082497	Excuse me, $325.
6082557	6082757	Full-size.
6087219	6087480	Yes.
6088461	6089622	Not 60 inches.
6089803	6090904	I would just make one.
6091545	6093047	I've made one in Maya.
6093527	6094108	I've rendered one in 3D.
6096678	6107085	So, yeah, I don't know if it will actually shoot guns, but apparently it does have a sound module that plays the activation search, auto search, disabled, and all those sounds.
6107105	6108126	Just trying to get to that baby.
6109747	6110327	Your funeral.
6110507	6113830	And lastly, some people are very excited about this MMO.
6113870	6114890	It's Guild Wars 2.
6115371	6116611	And I gotta admit, I'm pretty curious.
6116631	6117332	I want to check it out.
6117652	6119313	The launch date has been announced.
6119413	6123516	Get ready to lose sleep the night of Tuesday, August 28th.
6123596	6126358	That is the day that Guild Wars 2 is launching.
6127059	6133127	The next and final beta weekend event is planned for July 20th through 22nd if you want another little sneak peek.
6133488	6137974	Although I do believe you have to have pre-ordered the game to be in the beta, but you never know.
6138014	6140237	You might have a friend or something that can show the game to you.
6140577	6142760	Tuesday, August 28th is the day that that launches.
6143001	6143882	Moving on, DarkSakra.
6144614	6150496	Well, you know how there was that whole thing that was Kusu that got the Minecraft Lego set made?
6150996	6151896	There's Portal 1 now.
6152757	6159799	It's got GLaDOS's chamber, the modular testing chamber with turrets, cubes, portal gun, and more.
6159979	6170122	So you can go to lego.kusuo.com I don't want to say Kuso because that's Japanese for shit.
6171603	6177948	slash idea slash view slash 18258 pound as in the pound symbol.
6179329	6181611	Then Gunlord for Dreamcast.
6181991	6188136	Yes, there's still Dreamcast games being made and you can get it for 40 bucks or you get a limited edition for 50 bucks.
6188216	6190798	It has a dragon box for 120 bucks.
6191559	6193100	So yeah, yeah, Dreamcast.
6194061	6195302	I love the Dreamcast shit.
6196262	6221051	and then finally Sony says that their new racing wheel is going to have double the accuracy of a DualShock and it's kind of a weird spaceship shaped freaky ass controller thing that uses the move and that's how they're marketing it it's gonna be 40 bucks seriously this thing is fucking weird it uses the move as well so if you don't have a move you gotta get one of those too
6221911	6223133	Don't have him move your SOL.
6223193	6223833	Just don't buy it.
6223993	6227656	I mean, seriously, just don't buy the steering wheel thing.
6229438	6236804	Let's be honest, how many more racing games that are going to utilize that are going to come out on the PS3 before the next system comes out?
6237225	6238126	Probably like one or two.
6238326	6244211	I'm linking this ugly-ass thing in the chat room, and Ranma, if you'll please put this on our Tumblr, it's just completely hideous.
6245761	6248282	It looks actually kind of like a really weird sex toy.
6249483	6250663	Which the move looks like anyway.
6251924	6255145	Let's get into the Fugle Question of the Week.
6262168	6267109	Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook and the same question on Google+.
6267510	6268810	Put them together and you get Fugle.
6268850	6270571	That's why we call it the Fugle Question of the Week.
6270991	6273212	And because I can't let this topic go...
6274727	6276431	The question of the week this week was very simple.
6276852	6278897	And the question is, what is a gamer?
6280371	6280711	Actdeft says...
6308343	6309684	I'm an angel, but I'm a demon
6334807	6336408	Pretty in line with what we were saying earlier.
6337168	6342571	Flaco Jones replied and said, Anyone who games and is willing to identify themselves as a gamer.
6343412	6345393	I like that little kind of second twist there.
6345493	6347494	Willing to identify themselves as a gamer.
6347554	6349415	Maybe some folks on Facebook don't want to be gamers.
6349475	6350955	They just want to play their Price is Right slots.
6352296	6360621	Surtur says, A gamer is someone that includes video games, phone, handheld PC, and or console as part of their entertainment consumption.
6362101	6364463	So does that mean someone who budgets money for games?
6365404	6367345	Look at my house, gamer.
6369467	6372690	Alright, going to Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
6372750	6375632	Ragenator says, A miserable sack of lies.
6375872	6376553	Oh, there it is.
6376613	6377453	Another Castlevania joke.
6377894	6378674	Oh wait, never mind.
6378714	6379835	That's the answer to what is a man.
6380215	6383018	Well, actually it's a miserable little pile of secrets.
6383038	6383358	But anyway...
6384018	6388559	Well, in simplest terms, a gamer is one who plays games, regardless of the form they take.
6388679	6393500	Video games, CCGs, tabletop, pen and paper RPGs, etc.
6394120	6399661	Usually, and more often than not, those that play video games pretty much come to mind first and foremost.
6400281	6405903	You know, Ragenator reminded me of the Twitter rant I wrote on that whole conversation the first time it came up.
6406363	6407503	And I said something about...
6408283	6414059	This guy has probably never played Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition Come back when you've calculated a THACO, bitch
6416447	6429777	RedTheHaze says, It's a person who enjoys video games as a hobby.
6430157	6437343	I won't distinguish between who's hardcore or not since that's a very hipster douche sort of thing that was being done before it was cool.
6437843	6440905	It's video games, it's for fun, and we should all get along.
6442066	6443066	I like his answer.
6443587	6445907	It's very hippie and non-hippie at the same time.
6446328	6448268	Get along or I will fucking kill you.
6449929	6450309	Kinda.
6450509	6451109	I'm embellishing.
6452670	6455491	Picaruno says, I'd argue that there's no such thing as a gamer.
6456111	6463134	It's as redundant a term as breather or eater since everyone plays some form of game whether you're aware of it or not.
6463254	6464834	Unless you're supremely boring.
6465075	6467415	Unless you play first person shooters, no offense.
6469476	6471178	I think he's being funny, not serious.
6471378	6474000	Well, there's mouth breather, but, you know, that's something different.
6474500	6497337	Porkchop says, obviously, a gamer is someone who plays games, but to go all Mr. Miyagi, a gamer has the ability to disconnect from reality, to travel to other worlds, whether it be to solve puzzles, explore uncharted lands, or battle formidable foes, a gamer can become one with their environment and achieve greatness through hard work and dedication among their peers, or something like that.
6497617	6504684	Somehow, I just, like, thought at the end of that statement there, it should be, and enjoy a book at your local library.
6505665	6507347	You know, it's like, something like that.
6508668	6510190	It was a very zen answer.
6510370	6516176	It was, it was very, like, then you see the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland taking a big poof off the hookah.
6516196	6516637	Yeah.
6518863	6522246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6542623	6553029	I just thought that was... Like, why even have... Why would there need to be stock... I need... I need a picture of a nerdy girl sitting awkwardly on a couch while her friend smokes a hookah.
6553309	6555650	I need this now as stock footage.
6555670	6557291	They're high on life, Loki.
6559273	6560453	I just don't know why you'd need that.
6589059	6598723	Lastly, TigerClaw says, a gamer is a person who plays not just video games, but all sorts of games, be it board games, the pen and paper, role-playing games, or card games.
6599124	6603786	And lastly, Chiggers says, here's the real short answer, one who games.
6605123	6631141	I think we can all accept that answer thank you everybody for listening or thank you everybody for well thanks for listening sure but thanks for responding as well contributing on Facebook and plus participating is the big word we use at VOG Network yes participating but contributing too stop giving me the death stare why are you giving me the death stare I'm not giving you the death stare you are giving me a little bit of death stare no no no no no hey Jamie Jamie Jamie what Garris
6635009	6636029	Well, that's like a new thing.
6636309	6638590	The first 10 years were Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, what?
6638850	6641532	The second 10 years will be Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
6641952	6642272	Garris.
6644513	6645193	Teehee.
6645894	6646194	Loki.
6647134	6659961	So, apparently Hollywood's next big idea to bring to theaters, since they're adapting all sorts of properties, be it board game and movie title or comic book or, you know...
6661401	6663102	I don't know, all these reboots and stuff.
6663803	6666504	Now they're going to bring back Carmen Sandiego.
6667344	6669486	As in, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
6669526	6671427	You're journeying into geography.
6672627	6674828	You know a story like this is just begging for it.
6674908	6675229	It is.
6675289	6676209	It's just begging for it.
6676229	6676529	It is.
6676749	6677630	It's begging for it.
6678150	6682072	One, two, three.
6682132	6683173	And really any movie needs...
6684282	6687065	I don't want to hear the dubstep version of this though.
6687105	6689167	No, nothing beats dubstep.
6689187	6690148	That would be kind of funny.
6693511	6694532	We need to have a serious moment.
6695013	6697595	This is a for real serious moment.
6698836	6702780	I don't care if you have to blow all five of these men to get this to happen.
6703481	6707184	This movie is null and void if that song is not in it.
6708530	6709651	Can we all agree on that?
6710552	6711874	Play it in the credits.
6711994	6713015	Credits is fine.
6713316	6716319	It doesn't have to be the first or second song in the credits.
6716339	6719383	It's like the last song in the credits or second to last.
6723547	6728653	Have Carmen Sandiego be in New York City and these guys standing on the street do...
6730613	6732434	There's a hilarious cameo they could do.
6732454	6734355	She shows up in Disneyland and it's the Dapper Dance.
6735536	6735896	Fine.
6736837	6739999	I don't care how you do it, and I don't care if these guys have aged 20 years.
6740459	6741900	Get a new Rockapella.
6742341	6746123	If they can keep doing Minuto over and over, then they can do new Rockapella.
6746183	6747604	I agree with SSJ100, Matt.
6748165	6749866	Rockapella needs to be on standby at all times.
6750126	6759070	Here's the weird thing, though, about it, though, is it sounds like this is going to be based on... Granted, it's been a very long time since I played the PC game.
6759351	6761412	I don't remember if you were also a...
6765742	6769185	I think, weren't you part of the ACME agency or something like that?
6769285	6769505	Yes.
6770186	6774670	Because she was part of the ACME agency and then she turned to the life of crime or something like that.
6774830	6775550	She went rogue.
6775691	6776251	She went rogue.
6776972	6780014	Was there really a fucking backstory to Carmen Sandiego?
6780034	6780575	Yes, there apparently was.
6780595	6782957	I thought it was just like, we gotta capture this bitch.
6784939	6788262	The old version of the game, it's like, why are we looking for her?
6788502	6789142	She's bad.
6789282	6789583	Get her.
6790584	6791546	It was the whole story.
6791846	6793088	There was a cartoon series.
6793108	6794511	The cartoon series wasn't bad, I thought.
6794531	6797796	I played the crap out of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.
6798570	6808376	But anyways, the story, it's being penned by Darren Lemke, who did Shrek Forever After, and Jack the Giant Killer, I guess that's coming out soon.
6808496	6809096	Sounds great.
6809656	6822224	And then, of course, the movie involves Carmen Sandiego, who's turned from the greatest detective to an infamous criminal, and then her former colleagues try to hunt her down, and she...
6822924	6823825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6852443	6856824	and Angelina Jolie would go topless.
6856844	6859064	There's nothing wrong with a little gratuitous nudity.
6859644	6862345	I do believe that they're trying to make it a family.
6862365	6863925	She's naked under that red trench coat.
6864285	6869426	In my head, she always was naked under that red trench coat.
6869706	6877727	I believe that they're trying to make it a little family friendly, but I would be down for the topless uncut edition.
6877767	6878828	Uncut edition, exactly.
6878848	6879128	Unrated.
6881428	6909242	Family Friendly or Full On Big Breasted Nudity Sounds wonderful to me I look forward to the success of this movie and hopefully the Oregon Trail movie and Number Munchers the movie Hollywood is really out of ideas I think that's what we've come down to is that they're out of ideas
6909946	6910906	You know what's sad, though?
6911227	6915669	There was one essential character in the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego TV show.
6915949	6918950	Oh, you're not going to be able to hear this.
6919010	6923692	It's very quiet on this movie here, but it's the Chief.
6924012	6925073	You can hear that in the background.
6925093	6925733	Remember the Chief?
6926033	6926794	She was great.
6926894	6938819	She was great, and she was a character in the video games that they had and everything, but unfortunately that actress, Lynn Thigpen, she passed away a couple years ago, so unfortunately they would have to put somebody new in her role.
6939219	6941760	or somebody old in her role.
6941980	6948982	Perhaps somebody from the SimCity series that could maybe do some news reporting or something like that.
6950442	6952282	Yeah, but that wasn't a sassy black woman.
6952823	6953363	I don't care.
6953443	6955083	It's still alright.
6955623	6958424	It could be Samuel L. Jackson, a sassy black man.
6958824	6965226	Although, since race isn't an issue, if you want to talk about somebody old, Betty White would make a great chief.
6967139	6967840	Oh, I don't care.
6967900	6969381	Just run her over with a truck.
6969541	6971803	Just get the one chick from the community.
6972604	6975326	She's a sassy black woman that could play the role.
6976007	6976927	I think it'd work.
6977368	6980811	Or what's her name from Reno 911?
6982552	6982792	Maybe.
6984414	6990579	Wanda Sykes because, God, she can't be in more annoying roles out there.
6991200	6992761	Wanda Sykes is the chief.
6992981	6995282	Oh man, we probably should have done the listless tonight.
6995322	6999925	Sassy black woman you would have liked to have had as the chief, but unfortunately we have a different topic tonight.
7000225	7006109	That's a little specific.
7006489	7008790	Old edutainment game that needs to become a movie.
7009131	7011852	Kathy Griffin, because she identifies as a strong black woman.
7011892	7012813	Turtle, the movie.
7014133	7016455	Vandy has a great one, Medea as the chief.
7019975	7028019	All right, and since you all brought it up, the one actress who could be the new chief from Sin City Action News.
7028860	7034343	Carol Davenport here with a special report.
7034363	7035623	Tornado!
7035704	7036324	Sin City!
7036524	7037304	Big Wings!
7037645	7037885	Cars!
7037925	7039085	Trailer!
7039105	7040586	Sin City Animal Park!
7040646	7041367	Gone!
7041547	7042707	Forget it!
7042787	7044108	We're partly my hands!
7044308	7047850	We went to the Sin City Animal Park yesterday!
7049130	7051471	She literally disappeared off the face of the earth.
7051491	7052792	She is such a great actress.
7052852	7059194	I mean, you know somebody was just standing there off camera with a tornado blowing it in her face, and she was doing all that acting for the tornado.
7059214	7060255	It was just bravo.
7060475	7061475	Bravo, Carol Davenport.
7061495	7061935	Bravo.
7062556	7068058	And you know, back when I was kind of toying with the idea of FMV actors, where are they now?
7068538	7070399	She is not easy to find.
7070859	7071339	She isn't.
7071379	7072259	I tried to find her, too.
7072620	7075401	That's the interview I want more than any other.
7076485	7076986	Find me.
7077466	7078907	Find her and bring her to me.
7078927	7081530	SSJ100 Matt says he's still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo.
7084252	7091139	And Tiger Call recommended Zoe Saldana for Carmen Sandiego and that woman needs to eat some tacos.
7091639	7092460	I like her though.
7092600	7095063	She needs to eat something.
7096713	7098034	I love her in Star Trek.
7098695	7099515	She still needs to eat.
7100156	7101417	Uhura had some back, sorry.
7101437	7105741	We're going to go topless in Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
7106161	7111246	I'd even be fine with Mila Kunis doing the role.
7111906	7112687	I would pay to see that.
7112907	7113968	She is a gamer, isn't she?
7114208	7116830	She would be familiar with the subject material.
7116870	7120313	They've done fake topless with her, but it's time.
7120594	7122996	It's time in your career to elevate it to the next plateau.
7124137	7124397	Let's go.
7124637	7128721	If Halle Berry could go topless and win an Oscar, just saying.
7129121	7131283	How would you work a topless scene into Carameldansen?
7131323	7134225	I would even be fine with Halle Berry doing topless chief, you know?
7134245	7137028	She could be a sassy black woman.
7137348	7140831	For me, see, Halle Berry's not very sassy to me.
7141412	7143694	I always picture Monsters Ball, but I don't know.
7144154	7144775	And then Storm.
7145956	7146376	But anyway.
7146396	7146476	Okay.
7147802	7150564	No, Natalie Portman would not make Carmen Sandiego, sorry.
7150664	7156609	Here's how you work a topless scene into the Carmen Sandiego movie, is that she's hiding out in Monaco at the beach.
7157109	7164014	Because I think that was a scene in, what was that movie with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo that was basically James Bond, but it wasn't?
7164534	7165075	It was, um...
7166868	7167789	I'm not James Bond
7191768	7196512	She's just... I mean, come on, if Holly Berry's taking it off in Swordfish... Swordfish!
7196592	7198693	I mean, a movie that really didn't need that.
7199234	7199874	But she did it.
7200014	7202536	Thank you, Acidic Vampire, The Thomas Crown Affair.
7202636	7203097	That was it.
7203597	7204638	Uh... Remember?
7207742	7208063	All right.
7208804	7211728	Anyhow, what are you snickering at over there, DarkSakura?
7211928	7219880	Oh, one of my friends posted one of those demotivational posters of two midgets getting into a fight and says, I have a feeling this is going to be a short fight.
7220241	7221663	Oh, stop.
7221783	7222123	All right.
7223365	7224246	Thanks for watching!
7240060	7245186	40 years ago was when Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney got together and founded Atari.
7245346	7247449	At the time, it was Sigi.
7248530	7253216	I guess that's what they wanted to call it, but they couldn't get that name, so they went with Atari.
7253837	7254397	Great runner-up.
7255378	7256318	So yeah, that's awesome.
7256858	7259539	40 year anniversary for Atari.
7260039	7262220	And yeah, they did a little infographic.
7262240	7264080	1972 is when it was founded.
7264140	7265400	That's when Pong came out.
7265460	7266380	Breakout was 76.
7267761	7270741	The original Atari 2600 or the Atari VCS, 1977.
7270921	7272142	Let's see.
7273542	7277283	Of course, they don't mention the big video game crash in here.
7278063	7278663	Oh no, they do.
7278683	7278663	1983.
7278703	7279703	Revenues dropped 97%.
7284324	7292628	Later on, the Atari greatest hits on the iPad, which, by the way, on the 40th anniversary, they just made all the games free.
7293368	7299671	So I actually played, I didn't talk about it in my gaming week, because, like, LOL, Atari 2600, but I played, like, Combat 2.
7300431	7303973	I played Sword Quest, which was an amazing... There was a Combat 2?
7304953	7308615	It was a prototype that was never actually released, and it's in that iPad 1.
7309335	7310055	Is it any good?
7310395	7310616	No.
7311276	7311436	No.
7311736	7313157	Well, on the iPad, no.
7313277	7315438	But if it had come out many years ago, yes.
7315538	7317899	Because the terrain is different.
7317939	7322361	There's trees, which is different colored blocks that you can shoot through.
7322742	7325823	And it kind of has a more natural look.
7326003	7328384	Kind of like River Raid, but combat.
7328645	7330505	If that makes any sense at all.
7330846	7332787	Yes, Atari is 40 years old.
7332847	7339210	And I thought, you know, to celebrate Atari's birthday, maybe we could throw them a listless party!
7345011	7349896	That's right, we're going to play Listless, which we haven't done in a few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7349916	7352878	So let me explain how Listless works with you guys.
7353359	7359825	We are going to be coming up with the definitive list, and it's a highly scientific process we go through.
7360205	7361466	First, let me give you the topic.
7361807	7369474	Tonight's topic is... What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?
7371215	7374176	because let's be real, Atari slipped a little bit over the years.
7374717	7376057	Did any of you play Driver 3?
7376958	7380139	Did anybody actually own a Jaguar besides DarkSakura?
7380299	7381500	No, I haven't owned a Jaguar.
7381540	7381820	Really?
7382400	7385542	Because the only two games that were good on it, I actually owned on Sega Saturn.
7387614	7394258	So anyhow, we want to do a topic, what could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?
7396039	7403423	What we're going to do, each of us will go around here in studio, myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and special guest Alan tonight, and we're going to give our top three answers.
7404517	7405737	That's going to leave us with a list of 12.
7406178	7410999	And then the hard part, it's not fun, but science isn't easy, you guys.
7411199	7411880	It's not easy.
7411960	7415701	So we're going to have to go around and each person will take one item off the list.
7416201	7424964	That leaves us with a list of eight that those of you in our chat room live at live.vognetwork.com can vote on to make the definitive list.
7425244	7432627	Now, if you guys have suggestions, yell them out in our chat room because if one of our hosts decides they suddenly don't like one of the answers they wrote down before the show...
7433107	7455470	or one of the answers gets duplicated or they simply like your answer better then they will use it and hopefully give you credit unless they just happen to have wrote the same thing down already because I see one of my answers already got written down in chat so we'll see what happens oops it would help if I didn't leave the chat room all right I'm an idiot okay
7456431	7457932	Let's start the list.
7458472	7463593	Of course, I can't start the list until I open up WordPad.
7463613	7463974	There we go.
7464254	7465614	All right, let's start off the list.
7466194	7467895	Alan, you're the guest tonight, so you'll start us off.
7468795	7470256	Alan, your number three option.
7470296	7471996	How could Atari be relevant today like it was 1982?
7474577	7479699	Combat as a Facebook game with real money microtransactions to rotate more than once a day.
7482941	7484322	DarkSakura, we'll let ladies go next.
7484342	7485542	Your number three answer.
7510996	7515317	Atari Presents Pizza Time Theater The Game I see.
7515377	7517598	Wasn't Chuck E. Cheese at one time Pizza Time Theater?
7517618	7518018	No, additional.
7518278	7518598	I see.
7518678	7520699	So what would happen in Pizza Time Theater The Game?
7521779	7522320	You'd vomit.
7524200	7527921	And you'd have to shoot the animatronics with a pizza gun.
7527961	7529922	Did the animatronics go bad at night?
7530002	7535584	And then you'd have to run away from the employees and hide in the pole position machine so they don't kick you out.
7536744	7537164	Alright.
7538425	7538826	Let's see.
7539346	7540107	Stupid helicopter.
7540407	7541007	I'll go next.
7541047	7542008	I'll let Loki go last.
7542609	7546371	My answer for the thing that they could do, Garrus 2600.
7546451	7548633	This is my answer.
7550094	7553737	It would just be a brand new Atari 2600 game that is Garrus' face.
7555838	7557740	And that's all it can mouth things to.
7558020	7559301	And then that horrible, horrible 2600 chip.
7559321	7559561	So Garrus 2600.
7562063	7567246	All right, Loki, your number three answer for how could Atari be relevant today?
7567306	7567927	Marvel Madness 2.
7568107	7571949	Oh, a serious answer from Loki.
7571969	7572589	That's a good one.
7572609	7573610	That's a damn good answer.
7573630	7575011	Give me a new Marvel Madness game.
7576071	7576912	That's awesome.
7577092	7583236	Well, true, we did get Super Monkey Ball, but that's not quite... Not even close.
7583256	7583956	Marvel Madness 2.
7584236	7585157	All right.
7586137	7591062	So, so far we have Combat on Facebook, Pizza Time, Theater of the Game, Garrus 2600, and Marble Madness 2.
7591302	7592824	Let's go to the number two answers.
7593485	7593685	Alan?
7595199	7597461	Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition for Steam, XBLA, and iOS
7623536	7626819	And how would Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition work?
7627520	7631263	Just meows and he'd bounce around in his little suit.
7631584	7634807	Instead of going boop, boop, it goes meow, meow.
7634867	7637549	No, it would be meow, meow, meow.
7637790	7639791	And the little Pong thing would leave rainbow trails.
7640712	7641273	Perfect, right?
7641513	7642614	President Cat.
7642714	7643275	All right.
7644616	7648400	Loki, or excuse me, DarkSakura, your number two answer.
7650014	7674379	working 5200 controllers working 5200 controllers if anyone has ever owned one or more Atari 5200 you know the controllers are shit and even aftermarket controllers are kind of shit if they just had real 5200 controllers that you didn't have to hold a screwdriver to the contact to get it to hit start on your damn game
7675419	7677741	Then maybe the 5200 might have lived longer.
7677761	7678682	Maybe it might have caught on.
7678702	7682985	Because it has the best home version of Kix ever.
7683405	7684786	Can you tell that this is a sore point?
7685267	7685967	Maybe a little bit.
7686007	7686628	Just a little bit.
7687088	7690431	Alright, my answer is kind of similar to what we already heard, but it's what I wrote down.
7690491	7691191	I'm running with it.
7691691	7693813	I said remake E.T.
7694053	7696435	as a PlayStation Network Xbox Live Arcade game.
7697196	7697596	I had E.T.
7697876	7704041	the extraterrestrial 30 year anniversary HD remake pre-order bonus via GameStop exclusives.
7706201	7711004	I was gonna say remake Yars Revenge, and then I was like, oh, wait, they actually did that.
7711265	7713526	And, well, yeah, we're sitting here now.
7713986	7715487	So, uh, I say E.T.
7715808	7717789	It was just misunderstood.
7718630	7723633	If they would just have made it a little more difficult to fall in those fucking holes, it would have been so bad.
7723653	7728056	I played the hell out of that game, and I was seven, and children are stupid.
7728937	7730978	laughter
7733576	7733896	E.T.
7733956	7735096	was not that bad.
7735157	7737377	There were far worse games on the 2600.
7738177	7739338	Pac-Man being one of them.
7739458	7740098	Excuse me.
7746180	7747140	That game was shit.
7747600	7749001	Alright, at least E.T.
7749021	7750401	had that cool neck thing.
7750761	7753702	Alright, Loki, your number two answer.
7754342	7758804	My number two answer would be a sequel to Adventure in the Style of Skyrim.
7762694	7763421	Could that be awesome?
7764878	7768779	Yeah, it's like Atari has the most generic fucking name for an RPG ever.
7768939	7770080	They own that trademark.
7770680	7772721	Unless they sold it years ago, which is possible.
7772801	7775201	But they could make a sequel to Adventure.
7775221	7776602	Because remember, there was Adventure.
7777122	7777662	That's true.
7777922	7780343	Wasn't there a prototype for Adventure 2?
7780583	7782484	I want to say I've heard of one somewhere.
7782504	7783544	I think maybe.
7783684	7784284	I think there was.
7786105	7786285	No.
7786625	7789586	But what they need is they need Adventure with blood.
7789906	7792487	Like, when you kill those dragons, I want to feel it.
7795595	7803016	I want that shit that's in the Dawnguard expansion where swords go through heads and all that stuff and all that crazy, violent stuff from Skyrim.
7804156	7805177	Adventure with Violence.
7805357	7807819	Okay, number one answer time.
7808799	7811461	Adventure 2 was on the 5200 and it was a proto.
7812822	7817705	So I'm not crazy, but it was 5200, which far less people own than the 2600.
7817865	7819086	I've got two of them.
7819687	7820147	Give me one.
7820167	7821027	All right.
7822288	7825510	Alan, your number one answer for How Could Atari Be Relevant Like It Was 1982.
7826471	7829675	It was originally going to be the ET1, but that's yours now.
7830076	7835183	So I'm going to say finish what Custer's Revenge started and find a way to break into the adult entertainment industry.
7841016	7848000	You know, I think there's a hint of realness to that answer because it's like the one place that no one else would dare to go.
7848260	7853443	But Atari could have a future in pornography, except maybe it could be less racist next time.
7853463	7858565	That should have been my number three answer because it's more silly, but I was pressed for an idea.
7858745	7859246	Let's understand.
7859266	7860766	Did you get that one from Chad or did you make that up?
7860806	7861207	I made it up.
7861247	7861887	Oh, good times.
7861907	7862367	Good job.
7862447	7863828	All right.
7864108	7865689	DarkSakura, your number one pick.
7866189	7868631	You know this one because I said it before we even started this.
7869231	7871032	A new console, the Atari 1090.
7874334	7874574	Why 1090?
7875055	7876376	I don't know.
7878337	7879157	It sounds good.
7879798	7882980	We had the 7800 and I was going to do the 1080, but I don't know.
7883160	7888883	You've got 10 extra points of definition.
7889084	7892486	It's 1090 points of awesome Atari 1090.
7893399	7896143	So all those blocks will be super sharp and not too pixely.
7897325	7897685	All right.
7898226	7902031	My number one answer for how could Atari be relevant like it was in 1982.
7904033	7904894	More Tempest 2000.
7906114	7906455	Yes.
7907675	7908956	Yes, I agree with that, Rob.
7910197	7910958	More Tempest 2000.
7911378	7912098	And you know what?
7912438	7914120	You should recharge my Super Zapper.
7914140	7915581	Yeah, they did Tempest 3000.
7916041	7916501	Yes, I do.
7916641	7918803	That was supposed to be on the Jaguar.
7920023	7921724	I played it at Atari Party two years ago.
7922465	7922825	Nice.
7923025	7924066	Freaking awesome.
7924506	7925947	But we need more Tempest 2000.
7926127	7927268	Heck yeah.
7927448	7927848	I don't...
7929450	7931871	It wasn't on 2600, it was on the Jaguar.
7932672	7933512	And the Sega Saturn.
7934173	7936294	And then Tempest X was the PlayStation version.
7936594	7939156	And it had the most awesome soundtrack that ever awesomed.
7939176	7940357	I'll play you a clip later.
7940657	7941418	I'll play you a clip later.
7941778	7943980	Alright, but first we have to get the last answer.
7944660	7946782	Loki's number one answer.
7946902	7947182	Loki?
7948183	7959992	A combat MMO done in the style of 2600, but since they've got planes and tanks and stuff like that, imagine armies of tanks and planes and stuff like that fighting each other.
7960452	7969459	Kind of like the big open warfare that they have in Battlefield 3 or something like that, but with really 4-bit tanks.
7970540	7971000	I love it.
7971281	7971701	I love it.
7971801	7973162	Combat the MMO.
7973743	7973943	Sure.
7976078	7977119	I had to shorten it, sorry.
7978019	7981822	Alright, so let's recap the list before we get to the eliminations.
7982242	7985365	Combat as a Facebook game to rotate more than once a day.
7986686	7988347	I don't know why I wrote it that way, but that's what it says.
7988687	7998554	Pizza Time Theater the Game, Garrus 2600, Marvel Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, a working 5200 controller,
7999935	8013778	Remake ET is the PSN XBLA game, sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming, a new console, the Atari 1090, more Tempest 2000, or Combat the MMO.
8014298	8015178	This is a tricky one.
8015198	8016378	These are all really good answers.
8016418	8019359	I don't know if I'm going to be able to eliminate one, but it's got to happen.
8019399	8020439	It's part of the process.
8020899	8023480	So, Alan, we start with you.
8024260	8025900	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8025920	8026581	Oh, boy.
8027461	8028121	Come on, let's see.
8028762	8030847	See if I can do this without chat wanting to kill me.
8031389	8032050	I'm going to say...
8039048	8041670	Pizza Time Theater, The Game, because I don't know what that is.
8042471	8043452	Oh, it's Chuck E. Cheese.
8043492	8045393	Chuck E. Cheese and Chewbacca Pizza.
8045514	8045774	Okay.
8046354	8049237	But it is removed from the list.
8049297	8050378	It's a hard one.
8050898	8055042	Well, DarkSakura, you can get revenge right here and take one of his off, but maybe you'll find one you want more.
8055202	8056523	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8056643	8058585	Actually, Rob, I'm going to say Garrus 2600.
8058725	8059045	What?
8059626	8063889	Because I don't want anything to mar my Mass Effect prettiness.
8065790	8066951	by pixelating it.
8067551	8067931	Sorry.
8068291	8070272	I like my high-res Garrus.
8070312	8070772	Fine.
8070812	8073133	Garrus 2600 is stricken from the list.
8073933	8079175	I am going to remove... I'm going to remove... I'm sorry, Alan.
8079235	8091019	Don't withhold, but I'm going to remove Combat as a Facebook game because we kind of have two answers involving Combat and I think Atari is kind of already on Facebook and they suck, so that's not going to save them.
8091619	8092739	It is stricken from the list.
8093200	8093580	Sorry.
8094820	8095120	Alan!
8096161	8097062	Oh, he already removed.
8097242	8097622	Never mind.
8098122	8099383	Loki, your turn then.
8099563	8100964	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
8101144	8105467	The Atari 1090, because I don't know what the hell that is.
8105687	8107989	You don't understand where the extra 10 is.
8108609	8109770	I don't know.
8110470	8112672	All I see is it's a lot less powerful than the 2600.
8115313	8115834	All right.
8116294	8117154	That could be bad.
8117234	8117955	It's just like, okay.
8118035	8119175	I have an extra zero.
8119275	8119736	Sorry.
8119976	8121777	This half of the screen is black.
8121797	8123077	This half of the screen is white.
8123237	8123578	Oh, wait.
8123598	8124298	They switched.
8124858	8125679	Something's happening.
8127680	8128200	All right.
8128260	8129881	It is stricken from the list.
8130681	8131542	So here we go.
8131642	8133243	This is what I'm going to post into chat.
8133263	8136864	You're going to send a private message to Sky in chat if you're listening live.
8137225	8143428	Type slash MSG space SKIE space your number one and number two answers.
8144048	8144988	We will tally them up.
8145068	8145549	Here we go.
8145669	8162715	Marvel Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, Working 5200 Controllers, Remake ET is a PSNX BLA game, Sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, Finish What Custer's Revenge Started and Break into Adult Gaming, More Tempest 2000, or Combat the MMO.
8163939	8164359	There it is.
8164419	8168421	We're going to tally up your votes and we will read the answers a little later in the show.
8168901	8172943	First, let me read some of the answers that the chatters came up with here.
8174684	8178586	Frisbee says, bring back those Sword Quest games with the contest they had in them.
8179266	8180467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8199546	8227988	so let's see moving on let's see TigerClaw says remake Pac-Man 2600 with better graphics well that would be Pac-Man Legend of Zaku says ET remake with new super secret level where ET and Elliot recover the surplus codes or surplus copies from the New Mexico landfill where they lie today that's a good answer better yet the cartridges come back as zombies yeah
8228588	8230469	They rise from the grave.
8231850	8233531	Rise from your grave.
8234152	8236253	E.T., kill.
8237234	8238555	Hey, here's a bit of trivia for you.
8238695	8238915	What?
8239615	8239915	E.T.
8239875	8242377	's design was based off of a hairless, airless cat.
8242917	8243237	Really?
8243598	8244398	Yes, really.
8245099	8253584	I remember back in the day watching an HBO special with my mother and they showed how the sketches of a cat and then it was naked and everything.
8253884	8256586	Well, it does explain how he had so much control over Elliot then.
8258516	8260278	DarkSakura, I think we left off with one of your stories.
8272972	8273312	He did?
8273372	8273893	I forgot.
8274233	8274433	Yeah.
8274593	8275915	How about something about you, Suzuki?
8276475	8276896	Okay, sure.
8277256	8280519	He's announced a smartphone game called Gan Gan Pirates.
8281359	8282060	Yay!
8282601	8289106	It's a pirate-themed arcade-style shoot-em-up that is also competitive and cooperative multiplayer.
8289947	8291448	And it will be free-to-play.
8291468	8294411	It launches in Japan for iOS and Android in September.
8295111	8297253	And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and get it over here, too.
8298314	8299115	But nothing quite yet.
8301854	8302315	Who knows?
8302535	8303336	Gone Gone Pirates!
8303536	8304657	Is this a game you'd want to play?
8305138	8306539	If it's Yu Suzuki, heck yeah.
8308021	8311465	You know, I have a photo of him and my husband.
8311825	8313887	Yes, you have that up on your wall very proudly.
8314088	8314248	Yes.
8314708	8315129	Good times.
8315429	8315689	Loki?
8317231	8322417	So, EA's come out making bold claims and... I don't know.
8323129	8323929	They keep coming out.
8324890	8339315	Listen, if you're a company that's kind of the number two company right now as far as digital distribution goes, stop dogging on number one because going out there and saying, hey, we're going to be better than Steam.
8339635	8343837	We're going to do things Steam doesn't do, like not put things on sale.
8344137	8345378	How do you like that shit?
8345498	8345838	I mean, it...
8346858	8348080	Come out sounding stupid.
8348781	8353187	We're going to take everything that makes Steam successful and not do it, and we're going to kick their ass.
8353407	8355270	Fourth of July sale on Steam this week.
8356571	8357092	Just saying.
8357232	8357793	Let's pray.
8357893	8358494	Prayer circle.
8358534	8359255	Did it really start?
8359395	8361458	I know it hasn't started yet.
8361658	8363140	Let's form a prayer circle, everybody.
8364562	8365863	for a kick-ass Steam sale.
8366223	8368945	Actually, maybe that shouldn't happen because I'll end up spending $100.
8369045	8373829	I thought the pressure goal was going to be that they don't have a kick-ass sale so that we don't waste all of our money on it.
8373929	8374549	Yeah, that's true.
8375090	8381174	But anyways, so yeah, they basically said they want to be the Facebook of digital distribution compared to Valve's MySpace.
8384057	8385958	First off... That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
8386218	8387759	Yeah, it is the stupidest thing ever.
8387779	8388540	They're basically...
8389986	8391507	It's not gonna fucking happen, okay?
8391647	8399232	You're gonna talk all this shit, but no one is gonna fucking go to Origin over Steam.
8399332	8407438	I mean, granted, you're saying, oh, hey, look, you know, look at how well Origin's doing because all these people are signed up on it.
8407518	8410400	Yeah, because all your fucking EA games require it.
8410680	8413181	Even the ones that aren't even on PC.
8413201	8415103	You have to have a fucking Origin login.
8415123	8415203	Yeah.
8415783	8421727	So, yeah, you have a lot more users or people that are signed up.
8421767	8423068	Doesn't mean they're fucking buying things.
8423088	8426811	Well, to be fair, Valve did the same shit, and we all let it slip off.
8426831	8430974	Yes, but how many games does Valve release versus how many games EA releases?
8431374	8434256	Valve games are like once in a decade.
8434636	8434997	I don't know.
8435017	8436938	It's a fucking event.
8437118	8437859	Yes, exactly.
8438539	8443563	Because when Valve did it with Half-Life 2, no one knew what the fuck Steam was, and people were pissed about it.
8443603	8445184	But we've all forgiven them because they're Valve.
8447324	8452625	and Steam of course took a couple years to become fucking awesome so Origin is still a turd.
8453556	8458077	Yeah, but it's the turd that I'm hoping puts Mass Effect 3 on sale Tuesday.
8458177	8460857	Okay, so let me quote what they said here.
8461157	8462918	EA is really in an interesting place.
8462958	8474160	We have this bar that is set so high so that whether it is any of our games or services, we want to be 90-plus Metacritic at everything.
8474360	8476000	Origin is moving in that direction.
8476400	8477360	We are not there yet.
8477420	8479781	We understand that, but we're going to get there soon.
8480501	8481802	Thank you for watching!
8502333	8506076	MySpace is getting into that I love the 90s type of thing.
8506156	8511879	Or better yet, I love the 70s or something where it's like, oh, remember when everybody had a pet rock?
8512480	8517063	I'm not exactly going to go out and buy a pet rock, but I look back on it with fond memories.
8517623	8521506	Remember when people used to post blingies on your profile and they were funny?
8522206	8522706	That's MySpace.
8522726	8524407	That was never attractive, Rob.
8524508	8525608	That was never attractive.
8525628	8526589	It was always hilarious.
8526809	8533313	But like, you know, seriously, just... I just... What are they gonna start doing on Origin?
8533353	8545119	Are they gonna start, you know, adding these at Origin.com, you know, email addresses and stuff like that without telling you and making those public, you know, so people can message you without, you know, you knowing them?
8545419	8546500	Are they gonna start, you know...
8548049	8548690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8566224	8571212	So maybe you should consider not comparing yourself to that.
8572113	8578743	And then also not comparing yourself to the top provider of anything until you become the top provider of that.
8579885	8580346	Just saying.
8582048	8582508	Just saying.
8582669	8586852	I mean, obviously, yes, we aim to be better than our competition.
8587193	8591376	Cool, but don't talk so much shit until you have something to back it up with.
8592898	8593378	All right.
8593859	8602486	Before we get into the listless results and the mailbag tonight, let's get into one more story here about Blizzard because they make some pretty popular PC games.
8602506	8607050	I don't know if you've ever heard of Diablo, but that is kind of a big deal or World of Warcraft.
8608392	8612015	Blizzard has told us about what games will be coming to Gamescom 2012.
8612135	8618482	Mists of Pandaria will have its opening cinematic debuted and there will be a hands-on demo there.
8619002	8622466	Also multiplayer for Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm.
8623387	8630273	Also Diablo 3 will still be there in full display and all that but they're not really announcing anything with Diablo 3.
8632495	8637700	The other thing I want to say is that Gamescom 2012 is August 16th through 19th.
8638280	8645886	A lot of people theorizing that Mists of Pandaria's release date clearly will not be before that, but probably won't be long after that.
8645906	8650630	Because if they were debuting the cinematic then, well shit, the game's not out obviously before that.
8651050	8654473	So a lot of people are theorizing at this point late September 15th.
8654673	8656174	for the Mists of Pandaria expansion.
8656994	8661276	So it wasn't a full year of having to raid Dragon's Soul, but pretty fucking close.
8662596	8663076	Just saying.
8664937	8667278	Anyhow, let's open the mailbag.
8667418	8679223	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first, pick a few of her favorite emails, and reads them for you live on air.
8680703	8680843	Eh.
8681965	8682205	Okay.
8682886	8683627	First email.
8684788	8685149	Garris.
8685649	8686390	That's actually what it says.
8687231	8687572	Howdy!
8688112	8690856	First of all, a belated congratulations on your 10 year anniversary.
8691076	8691897	It's not late.
8692838	8693519	Congratulations.
8694080	8698105	One year I got a card for my birthday, which is in August, when I visited my grandparents for Christmas.
8698245	8698726	That is late.
8700027	8703450	Anyway, like many lemmings, I've been following the news of Microsoft's Surface announcement.
8703930	8705551	At first, I didn't think much of this announcement.
8705591	8706392	Then it dawned on me.
8706812	8712596	If pulled off correctly, Microsoft Surface can do what tablets, netbooks, and the iPad have been able to do.
8712776	8715118	Bring PC titles to the portable market.
8715758	8721122	Now, I'm not talking about the latest and greatest titles, but games from several years ago that people can still appreciate.
8721542	8726026	Hell, if they could get a good version of The Sims or WoW working on the thing, Microsoft Surface can take off.
8726686	8728127	Stay Black, Red Entertainment, Garris.
8728327	8728988	Sent from my iPad.
8731609	8734431	So clearly he's interested in the Surface if he sent it from his iPad.
8735171	8736312	Unless that was a joke, I don't know.
8738453	8741755	The Surface, the press conference was a little bit of a letdown.
8741775	8743716	I think we were expecting something bigger.
8744376	8749419	For me, I have one of the new iPads now, so I'm not really interested in a tablet for another three years at least.
8749519	8751660	They do some interesting things with it, that's for sure.
8751960	8757083	And I mean, if I was going to buy a tablet, I would probably get one of those, but...
8757423	8759164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8780738	8784762	So the next email comes from rdgsingh.
8785543	8788306	So small news for those into Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.
8788866	8795713	A recent fan-made patch was released that removes a set of in-game rules called laws allowing the player to play in more inventive ways.
8796834	8799157	And you can find an article on that on romhacking.net.
8800689	8801329	Okay, cool.
8802469	8802970	Next email.
8804290	8806170	Hey, OLR, this is Blade 3, a.k.a.
8806210	8806831	The Honey Badger.
8807091	8808111	What, because you don't give a fuck?
8809011	8813612	I just wanted to say congratulations on your 10th anniversary and so sorry I cannot participate live.
8814153	8819234	Also, I was chatting through Steam with Nick Crafter from Video Game Show, another show syndicated by All Games.
8819774	8819894	Um, um,
8843777	8844398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8867097	8875930	are the hosts of this show, Bobby Blackwolf Show, and sometimes hosts of other shows depending on the network already, depending on what the topic is.
8876010	8881557	But if you really want to talk to somebody in charge, you need to talk to one of us or Bobby.
8882058	8884141	So just putting that out there because I don't
8884421	8890623	Ever, ever, ever want somebody to promise something on behalf of VOG we can't deliver on.
8891103	8892223	Just to make that very clear.
8892583	8901825	I'm not saying no in this case, but I can say we are looking for more stuff than just video games.
8902205	8907527	Although I am familiar with this show, and it's a pretty kick-ass show, and I'd be happy to work with them in some capacity.
8907907	8911268	But we'd definitely like more shows on comic books,
8912828	8912888	P.S.
8912908	8915690	I have been listening since 2004 when I got my first iPod, the iPod Mini.
8915710	8919373	I have grown up on your show as I was only 10 years old when I began listening and I am now 18.
8919414	8920114	Thanks for everything.
8920134	8921855	I cannot tell you what it would be like without your show.
8941044	8941985	DarkSakura.com
8961844	8986822	few websites have mentioned a Sega rep state of the game could be localized if there was an interest I tried to contact Sega's community folks but got no response what do you think could be done to get Sega's attention on bringing Project Diva over here hit them on Twitter hit them on Facebook hit them through the forums get other people to do it too and why not make a stupid online petition I don't know
8991759	9018589	get enough people to say something to them start a Facebook community get out there and pick it with signs yeah Facebook is a pretty decent way to be visible in this day and age and that's not a bad idea because that also gives them numbers which they can then take back to management and say look 15,000 people want this game and that'll help so anyhow
9021932	9022372	Next email?
9023153	9026694	Next email is from... No, not next email.
9026714	9027694	There's more to this email.
9028635	9029615	There were more questions.
9029835	9031156	Rob, jumping to conclusions.
9032336	9033216	For shame, for shame.
9033637	9035557	What is everyone's thoughts on Microsoft Surface?
9036238	9037118	I have no thoughts on this.
9039130	9040510	Oh, didn't we just talk about that a little bit?
9040830	9041051	We did.
9041071	9043031	So we can defer to the prior conversation.
9043491	9044131	Okay, Sky.
9044912	9045172	Uh-oh.
9045392	9051654	Since you express interest in first-party shooters, do give Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 a try on PC.
9052194	9056975	Each of Team Fortress 2's nine classes have play styles that don't always rely on having pinpoint accuracy.
9057715	9060156	On the other hand, Left 4 Dead 2 should help you improve your aim a bit.
9061522	9065146	I have played a little bit of Left 4 Dead 1 and it was fun.
9065687	9067208	Alan and I played that a little bit.
9067268	9067809	Right, Alan?
9067829	9068990	And we had some good times with that.
9069611	9070071	Left 4 Dead.
9070492	9071893	I was really, really bad at it.
9072053	9072634	It was kind of fun.
9073795	9076899	Have a good evening and may a visit to Pinkberry be in your futures.
9076919	9078380	And that comes from the nasty Canasta.
9078821	9079121	P.S.
9079281	9080423	Garris and Tali too.
9082565	9083546	And there are no more emails.
9085376	9091824	Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us another email for a future week.
9093085	9096009	Alright, let's do a few more stories.
9096069	9097010	Oh no, the FUs of the week.
9097430	9098612	We gotta get our angst out.
9099232	9100414	It's time to get ranty.
9101775	9102116	Why?
9102216	9102797	Because we can.
9119011	9124133	F you to Gluten for making me freaking sick all day yesterday to where I couldn't even leave the house.
9126434	9127835	I bet the pizza was so good.
9129796	9129976	Alan.
9131328	9139150	So once my new job starts and I'm fully trained and I'm actually allowed to do it by myself, it's like super late night shift depending on how shitty things are.
9139871	9146553	So won't be able to leave work until possibly 11 or midnight, which means I'm going to have to get a car at some point.
9147253	9151114	Someone's not going to pick my ass up all the time that late when they have a morning job.
9151194	9156535	So I guess FU to the reality that I might have to have a car and a license by the end of the year.
9157196	9157976	You should get a Vespa.
9159444	9163708	And yes, I know that I'm nearly 34 with no license and a car, and there's a very long history behind it.
9163928	9168111	Like, my family never had a car growing up, and I just thought that it's expensive and scary and shitty.
9168591	9169672	You know, I finally have to do it.
9170553	9178619	Well, like I told you before, my mom had a lot of the same thoughts you did, and she didn't end up getting a license until she was 37, and pretty much had to.
9179620	9182262	But she takes back roads everywhere, she just didn't have to touch the freeway.
9182522	9186005	Growing up in the East Bay and on the peninsula of San Francisco, the transit...
9187822	9191645	A joke compared to, like, New York, but it was good enough that I made it work.
9192186	9194968	Up here in Sacramento, transit sucks, so... Yeah.
9196950	9197610	Alright, Loki.
9198471	9202894	Uh, fuck you to the sudden bursting water pipe that we had at our house.
9203375	9208199	Thankfully we caught it right when it happened, so there wasn't any damage, but...
9208639	9210440	Still, the whole process is fucking annoying.
9210460	9217302	We have a giant dehumidifier, which is the size of a small fridge.
9217342	9219563	It sounds like a loud can opener.
9219943	9222624	I was reading about that on Nelly's Facebook.
9222664	9223585	Sorry that happened to you guys.
9223945	9224725	At least we were home.
9225085	9227246	She was about to leave.
9227306	9230887	I had to talk to some people that they were not home when that happened.
9231167	9231727	That was not fun.
9233348	9234929	Alright, let's see.
9236550	9241153	My FU of the week goes to the fact, this is easy, the fact that I was sick on my birthday.
9241753	9242273	That's right.
9242554	9245715	I don't know how, but I caught some type of sinus-y infection thingy.
9246276	9248017	You might hear it in my voice still, actually.
9248657	9249658	I sound a little different tonight.
9250018	9252980	I've been trying to kick this for about a week, which included on my birthday.
9253060	9255441	So thank you, Mother Nature, for that little present.
9255481	9256242	Really appreciate it.
9256402	9259964	Speaking of presents, just to let you know, I've got presents coming for both of you.
9260664	9261825	I have to finish making them.
9263086	9263566	Very cool.
9263766	9266889	But there are presents coming, and they are for you both.
9267649	9268210	Aw, yay.
9268390	9270932	The next OLR is going to be on my birthday.
9271813	9272293	Oh my god.
9272313	9274315	Oh shit, that means I can't do it, huh?
9274895	9276777	No, we don't have to do anything out for my birthday.
9276837	9277617	We'll figure something out.
9277657	9278678	We'll do it before or after.
9279379	9280820	But I'll have to bring it then.
9280920	9282121	You'll probably have to work anyway.
9282601	9283802	Oh wait, no, maybe not on the 8th.
9284042	9284243	Yeah.
9284703	9285784	Oh well, we'll figure something out.
9285904	9286024	Yeah.
9286204	9288466	We'll throw a party on air just for you.
9288946	9290688	Maybe you'll have to come right back next week.
9290708	9293350	Wicked says F you to being bad at Cataheroics.
9294471	9296373	And I'm sorry.
9296993	9301577	I shouldn't have been so mercenary in saying how could anyone die on Benedictus.
9302238	9305641	Because I have been in a fail party that died on Benedictus.
9306542	9307643	Not through anything I did.
9307743	9308924	Through everybody else sucking.
9309985	9310125	So...
9312202	9313704	Only the WoW players know what I'm talking about.
9313724	9317229	Just make sure you don't stand in stuff and dodge the waves.
9317369	9319011	Okay, I have an F you to add.
9319271	9320453	What?
9320633	9323317	To the add-on GTFO for being annoying.
9323937	9326080	You're standing in shit.
9326821	9328183	You need to tell it to GTFO.
9329284	9331685	I thought it would help, and it just was annoying.
9332345	9335727	Alright, let's get to the listless results.
9335927	9337408	You've all been dying to hear it.
9337528	9341289	What is the definitive answer, kids, to the list?
9341790	9344591	Thing that Atari 2600, or excuse me, Atari in general...
9345131	9348114	could do to be relevant like they were in the 2600 days?
9348474	9350897	How could a 40-year-old company be as relevant as they were in 1982?
9351297	9358444	Here it is, the top three answers, as mentioned, nominated by the hosts and voted on by chat.
9358504	9359065	Number three.
9360546	9366712	Number three answer is... Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.
9367192	9367793	Yay!
9367833	9368594	Y'all are pervs.
9368634	9371577	That's the number three answer.
9371877	9375921	The number two answer tonight... Marble Madness 2.
9376762	9378123	That's the game people want.
9378343	9379564	That's definitely a game people want.
9379905	9383488	And the number one answer... What do you most want...
9384549	9387412	A sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim.
9389134	9391896	That is what will save Atari's ass.
9391916	9394259	And I still say it could be a launch title for the Atari 1090.
9394539	9395420	I do.
9396581	9397302	So there it is.
9397642	9399464	Your top three answers.
9399724	9400385	Thanks for playing.
9401326	9402607	Here's a lifetime supply of turtle wax.
9404184	9405585	All right, let's move on.
9405645	9408467	And Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat.
9408487	9413289	The other thing they could do that would be kind of funny is like an arcade game that's basically an Atari 2600.
9414070	9417792	But you know how they have that giant Tetris machine with the controller that's really huge?
9418072	9419073	You do one even better.
9419353	9422375	My God, I played that at Golf Land like a week or two ago.
9422395	9423455	I think it was scary.
9423495	9425116	The Atari 2600 controller is really simple.
9425136	9429199	It's just a giant button and basically a giant joystick.
9429719	9445965	you have this giant foam joystick that you can kind of swing on or whatever and a giant button and so you play 2600 games on a giant screen with the giant controller it would be funny a giant 2600 that would be great actually hilarious
9447455	9457005	Alright, so we talked a little bit about the Wii U, and of course there's all different companies promising to bring various games to the platform.
9457706	9463972	One of which is actually, well, they do have a game coming to the Wii U at launch.
9464092	9467456	Their Ninja Gaiden 3 is getting a port, but...
9467976	9495683	Team Ninja is also thinking about Dead or Alive 5 for the Wii U and that makes sense because if you think about it they're doing Ninja Gaiden 3 there's already Tekken Tag Tournament 2 so it wouldn't be that difficult to port a game over I think from the Playstation 3 or 360 to the Wii U and they're saying right now we're doing our best to get ready for Playstation 3 and 360 for the version of Dead or Alive 5 but we want to hear what players think about
9497663	9500805	and, you know, the Wii U version or if they'd be interested in it.
9501466	9508271	So, I could see that happening, especially like with a Game of the Year edition or something like that.
9508311	9511533	They could do it.
9511713	9513194	That could be pretty awesome, actually.
9513794	9519879	You know, because it's a fun series and it's always hilarious in this day and age to see very adult games on a Nintendo platform.
9521240	9523001	I'd be curious what the tablet would be for.
9523301	9524222	How about Boob Cam?
9524242	9524402	Boob Cam.
9525040	9526301	Well, they do have photo mode.
9527141	9527541	Do they?
9527801	9528342	Yes, they do.
9528522	9528882	Nice.
9530663	9538687	And remember, not only do they have photo mode, but I believe this game had transparent clothing.
9538807	9546451	You could actually get water or something like that on different parts of the clothing, and it would be the correct transparency and stuff like that.
9547352	9550593	Or maybe it was ripping clothing.
9550853	9553635	Something to the effect of you see more boobies.
9554295	9558757	Do you think Team Ninja would feel burned at all over the reception over Metroid Other M?
9558797	9560617	Or do you think it's kind of like, eh, you know?
9561057	9568420	I think, if anything, they're going to be more burned at the fact that Ninja Gaiden 3 sucks and that, you know, it's going to be launched out for the Wii U and people won't give a shit.
9569560	9569680	Aw.
9570281	9570601	Sorry.
9571361	9575222	Unless they go back and fix the game, I don't think people are going to give a shit.
9576983	9577403	All right.
9579444	9580665	One more news story for you guys.
9580685	9587670	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to add us on Skype.
9588030	9593875	Do remember, we appreciate if you check Echo 1-2-3 first before using Skype.
9594715	9595576	Think outside the box.
9595616	9597437	You can also use Skype on a Vita.
9597777	9601700	You can use Skype on an iOS device or I'm pretty sure Android has it too.
9602481	9605483	Many ways you can install Skype and call the show or
9605503	9607023	Or you can just pick up a damn telephone.
9607043	9610524	If you still have one of those telephones on your wall with a rotary dial, it will work.
9610544	9614905	1-877-GAME-OLR You just will probably have to dial a lot.
9615485	9616365	So get your finger ready.
9616845	9621426	But first, one more story, and this has to do with Retro City Rampage.
9621506	9624147	Some folks looking forward to this game because it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.
9624167	9625347	God, when the hell is that coming out?
9625367	9626447	If it was on the NES.
9627788	9633769	No answer, but what I can tell you, it's going to support cross-play on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
9634489	9638191	So meaning if you buy it on one platform, you get it on the other.
9638631	9640552	And you can play across the two.
9640612	9645715	Well, do you get it on the other or do you have to buy both and then you can play?
9645935	9646155	Nope.
9646415	9648856	You get one and you unlock the other.
9648937	9650417	So it's one game for both.
9650457	9650998	That's awesome.
9651138	9652438	One payment, both versions.
9652498	9652738	Hooray.
9652758	9654319	I know I will be getting it for the Vita.
9654479	9657621	As reported by IndieGames.com.
9657661	9659342	It's the pay once, cross play deal.
9660022	9663004	Uh, said by, uh, who is this guy?
9663384	9666426	Martin Turton, who's with Clever Beans, putting this game out.
9666766	9667006	Quote,
9684116	9687720	Basically, we want to price the game in a way that would attract us to buy it ourselves.
9688080	9689201	Very interesting tactic.
9689221	9690563	They're basically saying, you know what?
9690603	9698530	Yeah, we could double dip people, but if we don't and we make it free, it's going to attract more people to the game because it's like, hey, free game.
9698931	9705598	Well, I was originally going to get it on 360, although I might still buy it on PlayStation Network and 360 because...
9707219	9707860	It could be fun.
9708080	9708360	I don't know.
9708380	9708660	We'll see.
9709100	9709821	Start with Evita.
9710541	9711262	So that's pretty cool.
9711342	9713803	So good job on you, Retro City Rampage.
9713863	9715244	Some good news to end with tonight.
9716805	9717866	We're going to open up Skypline.
9718006	9718466	It's open.
9718647	9720108	If you want to call, do it now.
9720128	9725391	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9730646	9731867	I'm logging into Twitter right now.
9740100	9742821	Yeah, Rob, on your Twitter as I check my Facebook.
9744381	9746441	Let's go to some tweets while we wait for calls.
9746481	9747382	Again, Skype line is open.
9747402	9748502	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9748562	9749102	Easy name on Skype.
9749162	9749602	Orange on radio.
9751863	9755744	YYR says, Ask Dark Tetsuya.
9757064	9759144	That's the person right below.
9759264	9759464	Sorry.
9759484	9760185	That's not me.
9760405	9761685	Ask Dark Sakura.
9762626	9768715	to give Fernando, the main character in Bungie Ferret Tossing, or BFD, a last name.
9769316	9772060	He's French-Canadian, and then get back to me.
9773325	9775666	Well shit, this could have been the listless tonight, but oops.
9776687	9780589	Fernando needs a last name.
9780629	9781730	He is French-Canadian.
9781810	9782330	Cocteau.
9783631	9786312	I was going to say an amalgamation of Celine Dion.
9787533	9788373	She's French-Canadian.
9789914	9791415	Fernando Celine Dion?
9791455	9792716	Fernando C. Dion.
9794858	9795798	All right, never mind.
9796219	9796719	That's stupid.
9797799	9798339	Yeah, that is.
9798820	9801401	Oh, poor Alan.
9801641	9805442	No, I mean, I was trying to think of a way to make it work like Ceci Dion.
9805662	9807963	You think about that, DarkSakura, while I take this call.
9808003	9808443	Poisson.
9808664	9809644	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9809664	9810124	No, I thought of it.
9810224	9810664	Poisson.
9810824	9811565	I'm taking a call.
9811625	9812525	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9812545	9812905	Who's this?
9814706	9815566	Hey, what's up?
9815606	9817347	This is John, a.k.a.
9817427	9818748	Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network.
9818948	9820768	What is up, John, a.k.a.
9820828	9822749	Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network?
9823089	9824350	Indie podcast, holla.
9825598	9826298	What's up, Robert?
9828119	9828559	What's up?
9828959	9836241	This is the first time I've actually been in the chat listening to the show live, but I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now.
9836882	9837302	Awesome!
9837322	9840503	Well, thank you for joining us live, and I'm happy we could pop your Skype cherry tonight.
9842263	9842823	Definitely.
9843444	9845824	I meant to come in last week, but, you know, wow.
9846805	9847505	Don't you say anything.
9848750	9852871	It was kind of a pain in the ass to get through last week, so it's a lot clearer tonight.
9855111	9855571	Definitely.
9855591	9865353	I just wanted to say hi to everybody there, and just kind of slightly promote Nerdgasm Network a little bit, but I do have a little bit of discussion.
9865433	9867314	It's not shameless self-promotion completely.
9867614	9868034	All right.
9868254	9870934	Okay, first discussion, then shameless self-promotion.
9872475	9872755	Gotcha.
9872775	9872875	Okay.
9875028	9897406	There were some talks with the Wii U earlier, and I mentioned this inside the chat, and I kind of want to get your guys' opinion on this, but it seems like Nintendo's not really kind of learning from their old mistakes, because the Wii kind of came out before the 360 and the PS3, I believe, and you can obviously tell by comparison that the Wii is not the strongest graphically of the three systems.
9899168	9914263	and sadly, it seems like the Wii U is going to come out again and while it's going to be superior to the 360 and the PS3 as far as graphics and check and everything, it's still going to vastly be inferior to, you know, whatever the Microsoft Sony platform is going to be.
9914283	9917086	I'm just wondering, do you think Nintendo...
9918197	9920158	Should have even, like, brought this out now?
9920539	9923581	Or do you think they probably should have waited a year and tried to equalize it?
9923621	9928224	I mean, do they understand that they're going to, you know, that they're essentially going to repeat the path?
9928664	9939091	Here's the thing, and, you know, in theory, what you're saying, it sounds good, and to me, as somebody who's been gaming for many, many years, it makes a lot of sense, and I always want the best technology and all that.
9939511	9945095	However, there's one big flaw, and that is the Wii sold fuck-tons.
9945615	9946996	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9969624	9975107	The theory that you do have here is right, in that the technology will lose steam, and it will lose steam fast.
9975608	9984113	That's the problem, is that the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, they're continuing to sell, in some ways, Sony better than ever, but Nintendo...
9985512	9986533	Thanks for watching!
10005066	10007448	The Wii U with an extra tablet controller.
10007688	10009029	People are familiar with tablets.
10009470	10014233	I don't think they're going to give a shit that it's slightly better graphics and it has a tablet controller on it.
10014253	10015735	They're going to be like, why do I need this?
10015835	10017196	I can buy a Wii.
10017336	10018437	And honestly, they can.
10018657	10020238	They can buy a Wii and New Super Mario Bros.
10020278	10023921	and they have pretty much the same offering as New Super Mario Bros.
10024161	10029766	U and a Wii U. Except they don't have the extra tablet controller and the graphics are slightly prettier, I guess.
10031314	10037396	I guess at the end of the day it also comes down to how badly do soccer moms across America want a sequel to New Super Mario Bros.
10037436	10042137	Wii because it's about the most exciting original IP that Nintendo unveiled for that thing.
10043957	10048098	And it's not even that original, but it's a successful formula.
10048519	10049679	That's what this is all about.
10051593	10057582	And sadly, I think software might end up playing a big issue, especially, I mean, it's Nintendo, so obviously third-party software is going to be a big issue.
10058162	10063350	Especially because when they first originally announced the Wii U, one of the big titles they were toting was Batman Arkham City.
10063790	10067736	And the thing is, that's already been out for about a year, and the Wii U still isn't even out yet.
10069005	10074530	So are they still really going to be toting a two-year-old game?
10074750	10079134	Well, sadly if E3 is any indication, yes.
10079495	10081617	But it's got a cool new mechanism.
10082157	10084659	But I don't think that's necessarily a big game for them.
10084679	10092186	Because, I mean, yeah, it's cool that they have Batman Arkham City, but there's plenty of other games that are coming out around the same time, like Assassin's Creed 3, which will be pretty big.
10092226	10094829	And then they've got a lot of exclusives for the system as well.
10095129	10096550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10118079	10120601	That's just... It seems like easy money.
10120621	10123883	Unless I can finally romance some of the characters I've been wanting to romance.
10124163	10124883	Like who?
10126904	10129966	It's my secret.
10131267	10131707	Chakwas.
10131787	10135109	I can see him doing a Game of the Year edition with Mass Effect, although that would be pretty quick.
10135129	10138431	She is a bit of a cougar, isn't she?
10138451	10139131	Exactly.
10139371	10142233	Self-promotion time, so we can wrap up and get more calls.
10142273	10142954	Self-promotion.
10143034	10145375	We like to support indie podcasts, so please plug away.
10146809	10148510	Alright, I got three podcasts I want to plug.
10148870	10151951	Obviously, my home at nerdgasmnetwork.com.
10152731	10153992	We got great discussions going on.
10154012	10161055	We got a video game podcast that I co-host with Ryan, Josh, Patrick, a few other people.
10162915	10174220	They also have a new movie podcast where it's kind of like a riff track where they watch a movie and they kind of discuss, like, they kind of poke fun at it, but they also kind of discuss, you know,
10176837	10179057	That's a great idea.
10179517	10181798	I've heard other people talking about that sort of thing.
10181858	10188560	I don't want to call it a Riff Trax podcast, but that's kind of what heavily inspires this sort of thing to play along with the movie.
10189200	10193061	I'm glad somebody is doing it and not just talking about it.
10193161	10193581	It's great.
10194261	10202349	Yeah, we're just having issues with the YouTube channel because that's where we're uploading the films plus the commentary and we're getting some issues with that.
10202489	10204471	But we're working on it.
10204891	10212439	But you know, there's nothing wrong with putting just the commentary out there and say, okay, press play in 3, 2, 1, go.
10213019	10216423	And you can watch the movie along, especially if it's titles available on Netflix.
10216803	10217924	Tons of people have Netflix.
10217944	10218785	It'd be super easy.
10220339	10221840	Yeah, that'd be something to work on.
10222801	10230327	Also, Nerdgasm Network is home to the bi-weekly Beercasm, where Ryan and some more select group review beer.
10231948	10237172	Well, my gosh, you don't just have a podcast, you have a whole freaking network over there, but that sounds, that's awesome.
10238373	10240715	Yeah, there's also a couple other shows coming down the pipeline.
10240735	10245119	We've got a music podcast, there's going to be a tech, kind of an overall tech podcast coming up as well.
10246520	10248882	But yeah, nerdgasmnetwork.com, that's...
10250445	10252026	Like you said, indie podcast all the way.
10252266	10252867	That's right.
10254568	10257490	And I got one more site I kind of want to pimp out.
10258310	10259391	I'm sure you know these guys.
10259511	10262152	Slykick and Spike, the host of GameBooey.org.
10263073	10263753	That's right.
10264094	10266315	It's a newer show, but it's a lot of fun.
10268877	10271318	I used to go to high school with Spike, so I'm really good friends with him.
10271338	10275861	Slykick used to be a guest on my old podcast, Geeks or Fans, but that
10276397	10277597	Don't.
10279018	10283158	But, yeah, no, Spike and Slykicker, too, very, very good friends of mine.
10283238	10286639	And I've been begging them to come up and be on OLR forever.
10287099	10290120	So, open invite, guys.
10290160	10293200	You want to come pimp your show, get your butt up here to Sacramento.
10293240	10294240	It's not China.
10294280	10295601	It's not that far of a foreign land.
10298241	10300202	Yeah, well, try getting them to even get the stock.
10300222	10302262	I've been trying to get them to come out here for, like, 12 years now.
10303911	10307393	Alright, we'll both keep pestering him and one of us will win eventually.
10308354	10308954	Definitely.
10308994	10316559	In fact, I actually started listening to Lawrence Vondredio because of Horde House because Slidekick actually promoted a couple episodes he was on on Horde House.
10317779	10319760	Indie podcast promotion, it works.
10320060	10320500	It works.
10320940	10321700	Yeah, definitely.
10321720	10325201	Those are the two podcast sites that you guys should check out.
10325241	10327702	GameBlue.org and, of course, NerdGazzaNetwork.com.
10328122	10328562	All right.
10328822	10330942	If I let you plug anymore, I'm going to have to make you pay for it.
10331042	10331242	All right.
10332043	10332743	Have a good one, buddy.
10332763	10334343	I've got to take more calls, but thank you for your call.
10334743	10335544	All right.
10335564	10336044	No problem.
10336124	10336964	And keep listening to OR.
10337044	10337904	All right.
10337924	10338284	Will do.
10338504	10341165	By the way, I have decided on a last name thanks to Alan.
10341425	10341985	Oh, okay.
10342345	10342506	Bye.
10342526	10342926	Take care.
10343546	10343726	Yes.
10343846	10344466	You have a last name.
10344486	10345027	Thanks to Alan.
10345247	10345647	Poutine.
10346267	10346867	Poutine.
10347508	10349068	So the name will be Fernando Poutine.
10349128	10349929	Fernando Poutine.
10350109	10350429	All right.
10350469	10350809	There it is.
10350849	10351249	That's the name.
10351289	10351990	Fernando Poutine.
10352330	10353270	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10353290	10353670	Who's this?
10354231	10354771	It's Shane.
10354851	10355671	Hey, Shane.
10355691	10356111	What's up?
10357012	10357472	Me.
10357592	10358112	I'm awake.
10360353	10364495	Is there anything you wanted to call to share with us tonight?
10365315	10365635	Yes.
10366856	10368917	I want to talk about Mass Effect.
10369747	10370407	Yay!
10370448	10371268	My favorite topic!
10372069	10372989	It's mine too!
10373770	10374870	What a coincidence.
10375711	10376712	You know, it's weird.
10376732	10378653	So, I'll get it out of the way.
10378953	10383676	First of all, I do like the extended cut stuff, despite a lot of people hating it.
10383896	10389700	And I understand their complaints, but I like all the happy and sad parts of it, so it's cool.
10390761	10391341	But I think...
10392322	10410014	either Bioware is really stupid and the fans are brilliant or Bioware is an evil genius because I'm finding even more people starting to subscribe to the indoctrination theory after the extended cut now.
10410294	10414817	And there's all these new things that they put in the extended cut that point to it.
10415398	10416658	And it's getting ridiculous.
10416738	10419520	And I don't, I'm torn because I used to believe in it.
10419600	10420461	I still kind of do.
10422662	10447059	don't want to keep going with it if you want something to be true bad enough you'll find a way to make it true in your mind you know yes but there's videos and sound files again that's all part of they're just wishing really hard wishing I want it to be true click my heels three times there's no place like indoctrination theory there's no place like something like that
10447939	10450381	I don't think they would ever really say that.
10450481	10450741	I did.
10450881	10456726	Okay, well, so it hasn't just been about Mass Effect this week, though, but you also have been playing Final Fantasy XI with me.
10456826	10461109	And for a change, I started playing the game first and peer pressured you into buying it.
10461549	10464412	So what did you think about the return to Final Fantasy XI?
10465245	10474612	It was a nice homecoming sort of feeling, and I like that everything's familiar, but at the same time they've changed it enough that it's still interesting.
10475032	10484420	So it's not just the same, let's go to the dunes and level for four hours, but only get 50% of the way through a level because we died seven times.
10485140	10492442	I still really need to play Skyrim, even though I've been hearing kind of tepid reception of the DLC I never did beat the freaking campaign mode in the first game, I need to go back and do that
10512008	10512328	That's right.
10512348	10515811	I started replaying that last night because I got really bored and it was still okay.
10516371	10522396	But I'm not going to download any DLC because it's an Elder Scrolls game and they're generally awful.
10522676	10523356	So I don't care.
10523917	10524417	It's hit and miss.
10524437	10524857	It's hit and miss.
10525578	10525798	All right.
10525818	10527519	Well, anything else you want to share with us tonight, Shane?
10527960	10531642	No, because I'm sure I'll just talk more about Mass Effect on Horde House.
10531762	10537547	Well, like I was bugging you last night, just put the pen to paper and write up something to post on vognetwork.com.
10537647	10539368	Actually, Shane, I have to ask you a question.
10539915	10540815	I have an answer, what's up?
10540995	10545197	What do you think of my idea for an MMO for Mass Effect?
10546017	10551538	I would drop all my games to play it, but I also don't know how it would work.
10552479	10563262	Like, especially with the current universe the way it is, I don't know what we would really base the MMO off of.
10564800	10570305	I have to finish the third one before I can decide, but I'm sort of thinking, you know, post-endgame.
10571446	10574348	And then you have to figure out which ending's canon, then.
10574589	10575289	Prequel!
10575469	10576650	Prequel, prequel, prequel!
10576670	10578492	You just don't do it in the same storyline.
10578880	10587584	Nobody wants a prequel because then if you do a prequel and if you set it too far back, then you'd be stuck on Earth, which would be boring.
10587864	10594287	Easy-ass prequel because with the whole horde alliance, two-faction type of thing, Turian War.
10594927	10596708	You set the MMO during Turian War.
10596888	10598108	No, that's terrible.
10598608	10599269	I disagree.
10600609	10602390	Only because you wouldn't be able to romance a Turian.
10602950	10603431	Shut up.
10604731	10605671	Unless you were a Turian.
10605692	10606352	Because it's true.
10608180	10612004	It might be the first time we see female Turians, so that might make it worth it alone.
10612024	10616568	They were apparently in the comic, and they look horrible, so no.
10617489	10619290	That's not what female Turians look like in my head.
10619791	10620171	Alright.
10620732	10623314	Before this turns into the Mass Effect show, I gotta let you go, Shane.
10623434	10625156	Shane, we should do that, a Mass Effect show.
10625962	10627263	He's already pitched one to me.
10627763	10628683	Yeah, I already have.
10629103	10630804	And I say, produce a pilot.
10632065	10632445	All right.
10633265	10633505	All right.
10633545	10633885	Take care.
10634566	10636446	Bye-bye.
10636567	10636887	Bye.
10636907	10640688	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
10641529	10643950	I did tweet YYR back.
10644150	10644950	Hopefully he got it.
10644970	10646931	Because you're confusing the poor guy.
10646971	10648612	Because you sent him something else first, I think.
10648652	10649072	Poutine.
10649212	10649732	It is poutine.
10649752	10650572	I stick with poutine.
10650752	10651073	All right.
10651113	10652013	The final answer.
10653080	10656883	because that's a good idea because it's kind of disgusting looking but delicious.
10659225	10659925	Like a ferret?
10661106	10662247	Ferrets aren't delicious.
10662947	10663948	I've never had ferrets.
10663968	10665129	Alright, we have another call coming in.
10665169	10665589	Let's take it.
10665670	10666550	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10666570	10666890	Who's this?
10669172	10672615	Sorry, this is Techie Q. Say that again?
10673636	10675857	Sorry, this is Techie Q. Techie Q?
10676958	10679080	Techie Q. Techie Q. I gotcha.
10679120	10680381	Techie Q. What's on your mind, buddy?
10680421	10681161	Hi, welcome to the show.
10681862	10681982	Um...
10683121	10683642	Two things.
10684102	10689947	One, congratulations on your 10th year since I didn't get to call in last week.
10690188	10693871	The phone lines were absolutely bonkers last week, but we appreciate it.
10693911	10696633	We like the fact that our birthday can last across multiple weeks.
10698335	10701037	And also, I want to gloat on the classic game of the week.
10702058	10705642	I'm one of the few people that beat Ninja Gaiden without cheating.
10706482	10707944	Well, look at you!
10710983	10711783	Mad props, seriously.
10711803	10712904	I do want to shake your hand.
10712984	10714905	I'm giving you a virtual handshake right now.
10715205	10715805	He really did.
10715846	10718727	He held his hand up in front of the monitor.
10718787	10719007	I did.
10719427	10724090	I was looking for an emote icon that I could possibly send over, but that'll have to do.
10724190	10724490	There he is.
10724550	10725050	A thumbs up.
10725130	10727852	I just sent him.
10728472	10732594	I mean, seriously, it's really damn difficult to beat that game.
10732714	10733014	It is.
10733054	10735495	So anyone who has, hey, you get notice from me.
10735515	10738217	Especially like the last level, it's like an endurance run.
10739417	10742118	And isn't it just the biggest exercise in frustration?
10743859	10745379	For the first hour it is.
10746679	10748900	Back to three bosses you have to beat three times.
10749820	10750680	I'll put it this way.
10751141	10755302	Even beating Ghosts and Goblins isn't nearly as frustrating as Ninja Gaiden.
10756463	10760546	Let me ask you this question, Techie Q. Do you like the new Ninja Gaiden games?
10760566	10762247	Because clearly you're a fan of the old ones.
10762307	10764890	But do you think they got it right with the newer ones?
10765370	10766351	I don't like the third one.
10767172	10768152	It really dimmed it down.
10768413	10769173	Nobody does.
10769253	10770294	Let's be real.
10772509	10774371	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10788248	10789088	Yeah, that's crazy.
10816488	10817768	I think it's the humor in the 80s satire that
10832705	10835326	People miss out if you don't play enough of the game.
10835826	10835906	Yeah.
10852805	10854207	I think you'd like it too, right?
10854227	10859813	Because it's got a lot of 80s satire, and they did a Commodore 64 segment.
10861815	10862956	I'm going to have to check that out.
10863076	10863937	And boobies, right?
10863997	10865699	I heard there's lots of... Is there lots of boobies?
10866660	10868922	If you get the right costume, you get a grand for it.
10869022	10869362	There you go.
10869382	10869823	All right.
10870546	10874369	Alright, well, take a cue, I gotta let you go, but Lollipop Chainsaw, check it out.
10874590	10875711	Let you know what I think in a future week.
10875811	10876311	Okay, take care.
10876892	10877212	Take care.
10877232	10877793	Alright, bye.
10878613	10882877	Alright, I'm gonna have to close up the Skype line just because we're running a little long, but I still gotta get last minute stories and tweets.
10884378	10884859	You know what I want?
10885099	10885279	What?
10885479	10885880	Poutine.
10887181	10887822	I've had it before.
10888022	10888662	It's really good.
10888722	10889343	It is really good.
10889723	10890164	It is really good.
10890224	10896950	If you ask really, really nicely, maybe Alan will get you a little spoon and there's some strawberry pinkberry in the freezer.
10899693	10899954	All right.
10900174	10901678	Don't give her too much because I want some later.
10904424	10905286	One spoonful.
10905587	10906048	No, I'm kidding.
10906509	10906789	All right.
10910185	10911645	Zeeba tweets us saying,
10932555	10937079	But based on the first episode of Tron Uprising that I saw, yeah, it was pretty good.
10937399	10937940	I enjoyed it.
10938280	10939741	I was going to give it a positive review.
10940141	10941042	It wasn't perfect.
10941102	10944865	I felt the storyline was a little bit cliche and predictable.
10944945	10946066	But, you know, it is a cartoon.
10946106	10947167	Let's not be too harsh on it.
10947928	10950450	And I liked the whole, like, dark style of it.
10950770	10954553	You know, it was a very Batman animated series look.
10954573	10958076	Because, you know, Batman was always a black canvas as opposed to a white canvas.
10958336	10960378	And I'm pretty sure Tron is done very similarly.
10960991	10962012	You really liked it too, right?
10962273	10964915	Yeah, I watched the first three episodes.
10966437	10967157	It was good.
10967277	10968539	I've liked it so far.
10968879	10971201	I still need to catch up on some of them that I missed.
10971862	10972162	Alright.
10972963	10975706	DarkTetsuya says he's going to make good on President Cat Pong.
10976306	10977608	Google Nexus 7 GameStop
10991303	10992764	That story's been making the rounds this week.
10993264	10998807	It actually doesn't surprise me too much because GameStop has been openly like, trade us your iPhone, trade us your iPad.
10999167	11015696	They want to get into that market and I think it's because they're trying, you know, as much as I am personally not a fan of GameStop, I can appreciate that they're trying to stay a step ahead and like, oh shit, if everything goes digital distribution, our market's going to be hardware.
11015756	11017056	You know, we're going to be fucked soon.
11017156	11020158	So they're trying to get their fingers in other pie's
11020538	11022820	So that they don't go completely out of business.
11023240	11023881	So you know what?
11023901	11024802	It makes sense.
11025122	11029165	Honestly, I think it's because they're trying to get more reasons for people to trade in their stuff.
11029225	11032488	And some people want to trade in games to buy tablets and stuff.
11032548	11034950	And so that way they can sell more used games.
11036091	11036391	Interesting.
11036411	11038133	Because there's no markup in hardware.
11038853	11043017	I'm not sure about consumer electronics, but I know for game hardware there's no markup.
11043473	11045257	What I said has to be some of it, right?
11045698	11048325	I mean, that they're trying to get into other stuff than just the games.
11048365	11051413	They're not worried about it because of who they are.
11053534	11056836	One other tweet from TigerClaw, and this will be the last tweet, and then we can go to last-minute stories.
11056876	11057936	I don't know even if you have any.
11059558	11061479	The shutdown law in South Korea.
11061499	11063600	We reported on this either last week or the week before.
11064961	11066222	Some folks are challenging it.
11066462	11072486	NCSoft being one of them, according to this news story from GamesIndustry.biz that TigerClaw sent me on Twitter.
11073267	11078590	South Korea's shutdown law has been called into question by citizens and game companies.
11078951	11080872	Two lawsuits have been filed against the law.
11081492	11096060	One is a Korean organization representing parents and children who says the law undermines parental rights to educate their children We need that organization here
11098326	11098666	Agreed.
11099527	11107930	The second lawsuit was filed by game publishers NCSoft, Neowiz, and Nexon and they just argued the law itself is illegal.
11108630	11114692	The lawsuits were filed last fall and the arguments are currently being heard etc.
11114732	11115093	etc.
11115133	11117113	So we'll get more news on that in the coming weeks.
11117954	11118434	There you go.
11118634	11119374	That's it for tweets.
11119414	11120835	How about last minute stories tonight, Loki?
11122036	11130586	The voice actor for Duke Nukem is bitching that some of the voice acting work in video games goes over to film actors.
11131026	11135732	And he says, film actors do not need voice acting roles in video games or commercial projects.
11136692	11148558	These roles are for voice actors, not Hollywood celebrities, and when you consider the amount of money they make for each and every film project, it's unfair for those of us who have struggled to make ends meet in our chosen profession.
11149018	11161124	I have trained and worked hard for nearly 30 years as a voice actor, and when film stars land a role in either game or commercial project, they earn far more than I do, even though I am a SAG Afro...
11161664	11168388	I really hate to say it, but I think this guy is just... I mean, the reality is he needs to ask the question, well, why do celebrities get in Shrek?
11187279	11215956	and why are they in the Disney movies and why are they you know because unfortunately star power and the names behind it mean a lot and as much it's it sucks because this guy does have an iconic voice in many ways the voice of Duke Nukem right hail to the king baby and all that stuff right nobody knows his name maybe that's what needs to change maybe there needs to be more recognition about who you are
11216932	11219733	and then you build that star power.
11219853	11220953	I think that's the problem.
11220973	11229614	It just made me think about something, though, back to Mass Effect, how you've got Martin Sheen as the elusive man and modeled on him and everything.
11229934	11241076	You've got all of these actors, you know, Seth Green in it, but the main characters, well, yeah, main characters there, but the main character is a well-noted voice actor.
11242217	11244017	I'm actually thinking of the female Shepard character.
11244617	11273711	who's done like fantastic roles was in the Avengers cartoon was in X-Men in all kinds of stuff and you've got the talents going in that one where they're best directed and I think that that's really the approach that should be taken that everyone should be done by their merits what are their skills as a voice actor Martin Sheen sounds like Martin Sheen he's not hiding that this is Martin Sheen playing a role but I doubt he'd be able to go in and be a different voice than Martin Sheen you know what I mean
11276597	11277258	That's my point.
11277959	11279422	So I kind of agree and kind of don't.
11282587	11283087	Just saying.
11283228	11283708	Just saying.
11286172	11286693	All right.
11286833	11289057	Well, any other last-minute stories to share tonight?
11290540	11299183	Um, there's a new Kickstarter for a game that's, I guess, being built on the Rage engine.
11299843	11301243	And it's called Ravaged.
11301703	11306505	And I guess it's supposed to be like a multiplayer type game.
11306545	11310866	I guess Rage, you know, they were kind of promising this big multiplayer thing and it never really happened.
11311887	11328461	um so now it's this um oh it's being based in unreal 3 and it's gonna look like rage though so ravaged multiplayer kind of rage type game post-apocalyptic car racing gun fighting looks neat
11330091	11335594	Oh, and speaking of Kickstarter, that retro... Was it the Retro Game 101?
11335654	11336895	Yeah, you mentioned that last week.
11337035	11337755	Already hit it, right?
11337855	11338536	Yeah, they already hit it.
11339536	11340057	I'm surprised.
11341898	11343499	So Kickstarter is still working for some folks.
11343799	11343919	Yeah.
11345986	11348768	Some of us thought it would be a fad, but it's still going for some.
11349148	11354951	Yeah, speaking of Kickstarter, episode 8 out of 9 for Video Game High School.
11355051	11358634	So the last episode of this season is going to be on Thursday.
11359174	11362396	Can't wait, because it's been kind of frustrating.
11363177	11368180	And hopefully it's going to turn around for the last episode.
11368760	11370301	But yeah, I've liked it so far, though.
11371477	11371817	All right.
11372638	11377179	Well, that is going to bring to close another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11377219	11382041	But before we say goodnight, of course, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and say goodnight.
11382882	11385723	Alan, I want to thank you for joining us in studio tonight.
11386243	11389104	And your wit and humor is always appreciated on the show.
11389425	11389765	Thank you.
11389805	11390945	Bring more of it next time.
11390985	11391746	You're really funny.
11391826	11392086	Yeah.
11392486	11393806	I want the listeners to hear more of it.
11393866	11395767	I've been making dinner for like the last 20 minutes.
11396267	11396868	Understandable.
11397528	11399709	Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
11400648	11402810	Um, Strawberry Pinkberry in the freezer.
11403711	11404292	It's awesome.
11405373	11407456	And the apartment is really clean and I have laundry to fold.
11407716	11408057	That's it.
11408517	11409639	And that was really all you.
11409739	11413183	I was a lazy bitch today and Alan was like, I'm gonna clean.
11413203	11415847	Although I did get the bed propped up and you know, all that stuff, so.
11416627	11420549	And we need more people on our Origin friends list for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
11421410	11422751	Soon, soon.
11423011	11426372	If you're in the all army, message me or Sky.
11426873	11427513	Do you have your name?
11428514	11430835	I'm AlanAlchemy78 on Origin.
11432156	11432816	So play with us.
11433656	11434357	Play with me.
11434537	11435898	Although my galaxy is already at 100%.
11437429	11466592	still, multiplayer is really fun especially with friends anyhow, Loki, your final thought tonight I don't even know how much money those guys must have thrown at this crappy game in order to get it finished in that amount of time because I'm on the first challenge right now which is to find 4 80s themed lunch boxes and I found one in like the last 3 hours I don't even know how it's possible, they must have spent hundreds of dollars on this
11468191	11469592	And it's fucking boring.
11470052	11470852	I hate this game.
11471733	11472373	So much.
11474514	11475835	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
11477135	11478576	I have a little bit of brain freeze.
11479496	11480017	And Garrus.
11481286	11483968	My final thought tonight is happy Canada Day.
11485969	11487430	First, I would like to learn how to speak.
11487470	11488250	Poutine!
11488330	11492933	Second, happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.
11493634	11495755	I'm hoping to come visit your country again.
11495975	11501999	I had an absolute blast time in my life last time I was there, which was six years ago, which was far too long.
11502419	11505401	And last time was Vancouver, and next time I'm thinking Toronto.
11506362	11506862	Right, Alan?
11507342	11507903	Yes, yes.
11508403	11509164	So we'll see.
11509904	11514908	So yes, happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there and the not so beautiful ones too.
11515048	11518470	Although I saw nothing but good looking people when I was in Vancouver.
11519791	11525535	I will also say happy 4th of July to my fellow Americans this week.
11525695	11526356	Be safe.
11526756	11528978	Please do not set people's roofs on fire.
11529458	11534902	If you're going to do fireworks, especially illegal ones, have your bucket of water ready and just...
11535382	11536522	Freaking be safe with it.
11536563	11537703	Don't blow your finger off.
11537783	11538683	Don't be stupid.
11539744	11541945	The 4th of July is not to celebrate stupidity.
11542045	11542345	What up?
11542365	11544166	G asked if you ever said what the secret was.
11545686	11546286	What secret?
11546727	11547787	You said that you had a secret.
11547807	11549208	That I went back to Final Fantasy XI.
11549388	11550168	Oh, okay.
11550248	11551368	Did you know that before tonight?
11552689	11553629	Yeah, actually I did.
11553909	11554530	How did you know?
11554770	11556390	Because I saw your thing pop up.
11556691	11557451	Sky is playing...
11558403	11561485	Oh, I would have thought you would have said something if that was the case, like addict.
11561706	11562626	Didn't care.
11563427	11564168	Loki didn't know.
11564188	11565569	All right.
11566690	11567190	Sorry.
11567210	11576939	If someone does want to help me with this, all they have to do is they can play the app Ultimate Collector and then send me energy or money.
11577342	11583587	I got a frown from Acidic Vampire because I'm only talking about PC Mass Effect and you only plug the PC Mass Effect.
11583967	11585528	Of course I still play on 360 too.
11585588	11588110	In fact, my unlocks on 360 are way better.
11588590	11589471	And guess what I did?
11589611	11589831	What?
11590071	11591212	I brought back your game.
11591632	11592693	Yay!
11593113	11593834	You know what's sad?
11593974	11600258	Even though I have 1 and 2 on PC now, I think I'm going to do the replays on Xbox to get the rest of the achievements because I'm sad.
11600899	11601199	Whore.
11603038	11603878	Alright, that's it.
11604298	11608159	If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you didn't, help spread the word.
11608199	11608939	That's all we ask.

11611220	11612620	All we ask, spread the word.
11612700	11614661	Tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.
11614921	11616081	Help grow our family.

11618281	11619962	We had some new faces tonight in chat.
11620222	11625203	I really want to thank all you guys for taking the time out to listen to Orange Lounge Radio and help grow.
