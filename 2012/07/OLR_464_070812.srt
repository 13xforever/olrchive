00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sony purchases Gaikai

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What does this mean for retail?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Microsoft securing a domain name leads to speculation

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and a court in the European Union

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
makes a huge decision on reselling digital games

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and welcome back to another week of the show

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and his fantastic show

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If you are listening to us live

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We always appreciate you guys

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
participating along with our show

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I said your show, it is your show too

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
it's all of our shows

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We do like to bill ourselves

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
as the show where every gamer has a voice

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This voice you're hearing right now is Rob Roberts

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm one of three hosts on this show

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
along with the absent, sadly, tonight

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Dark Sakura

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Dark Sakura sadly called in a couple of hours

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
before the show tonight

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
She's not going to be able to make it

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She's recovering from being sick

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and she said

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Garris

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But joining us here in studio is tech master Loki

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How are you doing, Loki?

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm doing good

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah?

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright, it's all good?

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm full now because I've had like a liter of root beer

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That is a lot of soda

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What did you think about

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
not to get all political on this show

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but since, you know, I know a lot of gamers

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and I know a lot of gamers that drink soda

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
there was a lot of feedback to that whole New York City law

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that they were talking about

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
where they were going to ban

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the super-sized drinks and all that

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What did you think about that?

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Buy two drinks and

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's exactly

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Like, I just don't understand

65
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What am I going to do?

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can't get a large soda

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I mean, the large soda, I understand

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
it's twice as much as the small soda

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
but how am I going to get a large

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Buy two of them

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I mean, I don't even understand why that's a problem

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I somehow knew in my mind

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
that's exactly what you'd say

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Maybe having done this show with you for ten years

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and knowing you about us long is probably

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can predict these things

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I just, it's, it's dumb

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What they need to do is

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
they need to just charge, you know

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey, I'll tell you what

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll charge you, uh, you know

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
half price of a large for two

83
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
or, you know, each of the smalls

84
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and then we'll give you a large cup for free

85
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How about that?

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then you just pour it in there

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and, you know, loophole

88
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
For ten years and knowing you about us long

89
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
feedback, sorry

90
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Ugh, I am not with it tonight

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm hosting the show tonight

92
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not with it

93
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I forgot to enable the live check-ins

94
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
over at vognetwork.com

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and everybody in chat is screaming

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Man, turn it on, turn it on

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're having two hosts tonight

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Alan, I know we talked last week about

99
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's his birthday

100
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Happy birthday, Alan

101
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If you're out there listening from work

102
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
where he's at right now

103
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I was going to forward you a picture

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
but I couldn't do it on my phone

105
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm totally off topic here, but

106
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, that's fine

107
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Help me fill time

108
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There was a killer tattoo that I saw

109
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that was a Golden Girls tattoo

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What? A Golden Girls tattoo?

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A Golden Girls tattoo

112
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was like, man, Rob would have to get that

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What was it of? Be Arthur?

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It was of all of them

115
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All of them, and it said

116
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you for being a friend underneath it

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It was great

118
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I like that

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It was on Facebook

120
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But yeah, that was hilarious

121
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, um, yeah, lots of soda

122
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
See, I was almost gonna, I left early

123
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I was like, okay, I'm gonna go get something

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I normally get because, you know,

125
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have this extra time now

126
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So I thought about, well, I could go to In-N-Out

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I really don't like In-N-Out that much

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I mean, everyone loves their fries

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I think they taste like crap

130
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They taste like a little, I don't know, it's

131
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Not crispy enough, I guess

132
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Not enough salt

133
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They're very natural with their fries

134
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I don't like that

135
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want it to taste artificial and salty

136
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Alright, live listeners, it's all better

137
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can check in now at vognetwork.com

138
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sorry about that

139
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Things are gonna be a little broken tonight

140
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Because to hosting it, we kind of have to

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't get as many little breaks while

142
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Dark Soccer's talking or whatever

143
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And we couldn't scrounge up a third host fast enough

144
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
As I was saying, Alan worked today

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Although, to be fair, it was his choice

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because his boss said, you know, you want the day off

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's your birthday, whatever

148
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And Alan was like, oh, no, I want to make money on my birthday

149
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Sounds good

150
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sounds good to me, right?

151
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So there you go

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Which, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this

153
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But I'm gonna

154
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
His boss, you know who his boss is?

155
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
His boss is Jessica Harper from Understadation Live

156
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

157
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, they work together

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Isn't that funny?

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's awesome

160
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I know, it's like the VoG family at work and online

161
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So that's pretty funny

162
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't know if I was supposed to say that

163
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But oops, I have a big mouth

164
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Sorry about that

165
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Happy birthday

166
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Alright, anyhow

167
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Usually we get into talking about our gaming weeks

168
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But I want to do a kickoff topic beforehand as we usually do

169
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And I want to kind of address the pink elephant story in gaming

170
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You know, we know we're not breaking news to you here on Orange Lounge Radio

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But one thing we like to do is kind of present the news

172
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Put it on the table and talk about it a little bit

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
One of the big things that has everybody talking this week is

174
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Gaikai, right?

175
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because Gaikai got bought by Sony

176
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And, you know, I know there's some more with that

177
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's gonna come up a little later in the show

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But let's talk about kind of that first step there

179
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because Sony has bought Gaikai

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why, Loki?

181
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why did Sony feel they needed to buy Gaikai?

182
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
For streaming games, I mean, that could be useful

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They've got a lot of, you know, Sony is an electronics manufacturer

184
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They have laptops, TVs, tablets, phones

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So they want a way to stream the Sony or PlayStation brand

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
To all those devices at the same time

187
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Maybe somehow make them connected more with the PlayStation console

188
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Or just tying everything together

189
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think that's a good way to do it

190
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is just, you know, with a streaming platform

191
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You know, I think I've made this comparison before

192
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I may not have said it on the show

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I totally thought it, which counts on the internet

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And that is that the whole

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sony has been doing a little bit of that streaming

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
With the whole PlayStation 3 to the PSP

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Even before the Vita technology

198
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where you could, you know, remember

199
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've brought this up on the show before

200
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But if you're a new listener or whatever

201
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's one of the best hidden features

202
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That will really surprise you about the PSP

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is that that whole Wii U technology has existed

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not dogging Nintendo

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I realize Nintendo is going to try and perfect that with the Wii U

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's fine

207
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But that technology to stream from your console

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Has kind of been there with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP

209
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Granted, you're not streaming the full PlayStation 3 game

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That is not what's happening yet

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Although maybe this guy kind of purchases

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, and it's also not just

213
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You could stream like videos and other things

214
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And it's also not just Sony stuff

215
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I mean, you could stream it to pretty much any platform

216
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That would be connected to the internet

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, I mean, you could really stream it to like

218
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Android tablets or an iPad or whatever

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And so that's kind of, I could see them being interested in that

220
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Or, hey, they could even be just improving their streaming technology

221
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So that they can stream more sophisticated things to the Vita

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know, maybe PlayStation 4 type graphics or whatever

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Not necessarily graphics, because obviously you can't push that through the Vita

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But, you know, more intricate games that are going to have complicated graphics and stuff

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
To those devices

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
A little easier than you did with the PlayStation 3

227
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And you can also do that PSP PS3 integration through the internet

228
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If I remember correctly

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can actually, like, I could be at a friend's house

230
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Get into their Wi-Fi, turn on my PlayStation 3 at home

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And get whatever I need on there

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Although that's really limited to, I mean, video

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You know, I wouldn't try to stream a game off of there

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Like a PS1 game or anything, because the lag would be crazy

235
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Can you imagine trying to play, like, Umjama Lamy over to that connection?

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Nope

237
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Although that might be a fun challenge

238
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But, I mean, just the fact that I can, like, look at my home setup

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
On my home PlayStation 3 and my crossbar

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is kind of cool

241
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Like, it's a nerdy, whoa, Keanu Reeves meme moment, you know?

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah

243
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So, I'd be very curious of PlayStation trying to perfect that technology

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What about, you know, one thing I've been kind of thinking about is that

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
PlayStation Plus, they like to do these demos

246
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The 60 minute demos of the games

247
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But right now you have to pretty much download the whole darn game to your drive

248
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
In order to just play 60 minutes of it

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean, for some people, depending on your connection

250
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It takes longer to download the demo than it does that you actually get to play the demo

251
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Maybe they're looking into Gaikai technology to stream demos

252
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean, that would certainly be a great use for it that they could probably implement ASAP

253
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Uh, it's possible that they were looking at doing that

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I mean, they could do a bunch of different things

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I just don't know

256
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know, I don't know what they're really doing with it yet, I mean

257
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How do you, and let me pose this question to chat as well

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I'm behind on some chat comments

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In fact, let me read a couple right here even though they're on other topics

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I don't want to ignore our chatroom at chat.

261
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Excuse me, live.vognetwork.com

262
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But AcidicVampire says

263
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't drink soda much, water or iced tea

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know, there's a lot of people that

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know, when you drink soda a lot

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's kind of like one of the first things you kick

267
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When you decide you're going on a diet or whatever

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And it can be effective, like, I stopped drinking Mountain Dew once

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I lost like 10 pounds alone

270
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I could do that, but I'm not

271
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
ImmortalKing in our chatroom says

272
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Give yourselves credit, you've made a lot of exclusives

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, alright, maybe a few here or there

274
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
There may have been some like a week or two ago

275
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Regarding a new console or anything

276
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Perhaps, perhaps

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But we don't talk about that kind of stuff

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because everyone's going to forget it anyways

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And BobbyBlackWolf saves the day saying

280
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
chat.vognetwork.com, which I almost said

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That will work too, so you can use live or chat

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's the same darn thing

283
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But let me pose this question to you and pose this to the chat

284
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Going back to Gaikai a little bit

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How would you feel if they came out and said

286
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I know this probably is not going to happen, disclaimer

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But how would you feel anyway if they came out and said

288
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And on the Playstation 4, we're not going to have discs anymore

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're going to buy your games in your virtual library

290
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But you'll be able to stream them on demand

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And we hear that that's your option for the next console

292
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's basically a Gaikai slash on-live slash whatever console

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How would you feel about that?

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Would you still be on board with gaming or would you be out?

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Absolutely would not be buying that console

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Because I don't want to have to fucking deal with that shit

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And when you say fucking deal with that shit

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is it just you're pissed because you won't be able to

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Rampantly mod things like you've been able to do before

300
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I mean, it kind of puts the kibosh on all of that

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
No, not even at all, it's just I have to stream stuff

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, I have an internet connection one day

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Or, you know, who knows?

304
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, the internet's not always reliable

305
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Or I should say your internet connection's not always reliable

306
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's very true, we ran into that a couple weeks ago on the show

307
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So, I mean, I don't really

308
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I mean, it's fun to play, you know, let's imagine a world

309
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That this actually is going to happen

310
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But it's never going to happen because they built a monster

311
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That exists out there, that is their market share

312
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And there's no fucking way of getting rid of it

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because honestly, you know, if they decided

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey, we're going to put out a console

315
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's only going to be able to stream games

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're not going to be able to buy it at the stores

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Then games will be like, who the fuck's going to sell your console?

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your accessories, your points cards

319
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, that shit, your video cables

320
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, now you need us?

321
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, and you're not going to give us any of that software money?

322
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, fuck you guys, good luck selling your console on your own

323
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And that's honestly the situation that's going to be in

324
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Because there's no money to be had in

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Definitely no money to be had in consoles

326
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And definitely no money to be had in

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
At least not much money to be had in accessories

328
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So it's got to come all from the games

329
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And even though the profit margin in games aren't that great either

330
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But still, people trade in stuff

331
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And there's no use market

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So that's basically going to be taking away the money from

333
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The largest retailer for video games

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I'm sorry, but they kind of control what people do

335
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And so as much as all these companies want to go all digital

336
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's not going to fucking happen

337
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Definitely a lot of negative reaction to my question in chat

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Which I kind of expected, I think we all did

339
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But a lot of the reasoning focusing on the maintenance of your connection

340
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That you can't always trust your internet connection to be stable

341
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Which I can definitely support

342
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
AcidicVampire says, if it's streaming, what if your net connection slows down

343
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Therefore your game stutters? Yes

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Reginator says, I want systems with optical storage

345
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If only due to backwards compatibility

346
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Reimu says, suppose you can't connect to the internet

347
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
GameGuru says, screw that, I'll just stick with Steam then

348
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Interesting point about PC gaming

349
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean, streaming's been available on PC for a bit now

350
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And it certainly hasn't killed Steam

351
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Not by a long shot

352
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They can do that as another option

353
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
To say, hey you know what, you can either download your game

354
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Or you can stream it instead

355
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And that's cool that adding options is not a bad thing

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But completely removing all other physical options

357
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because you want to have control over the content

358
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And make sure that there's no piracy

359
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And also making sure that

360
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't know, whatever other reasons it has

361
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So that they have all the money, profit from it

362
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's just, it's not going to work

363
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Let me read a couple other very strong comments from chat

364
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
MegaBoyX says, I will never buy a system

365
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Unless I can own physical copies of the games

366
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Which, you know, some people want that type of control

367
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You technically don't own those, but you know

368
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, we could get into that whole thing

369
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But I mean, Alan, remember I plugged DBA

370
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Or Alan was here on the show last week

371
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And he plugged Zebay's auctions

372
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And I plugged them on Twitter and stuff

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He made decent money off those sales last week

374
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, they were old Game Boy Advance games

375
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But apparently some of them are very hard to come by

376
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Especially in other countries

377
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So he did pretty well off that

378
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So, you know, being able to resell your games

379
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
When you need a little cash

380
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think is something we all kind of like to have

381
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That kind of investment there

382
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I guess maybe it's like leasing a car versus buying a car

383
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know

384
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let me read the most blunt comment in chat, though

385
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I want to talk about this for a minute

386
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Blender at live.vognetwork.com says

387
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They do that, Sky, and I'm done gaming

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's probably the bluntest comment I've seen

389
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But I can't say I blame him

390
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Like...

391
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Go ahead

392
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, I just...

393
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Not to sound like real, like, disastrous

394
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Or dramatic or whatever

395
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But I've often wondered if that's what's ultimately gonna cause the end of OLR

396
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Especially when I see these stories about, you know,

397
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Xbox will prevent used game sales

398
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
PlayStation gets Gaikai

399
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And maybe will stream only

400
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Although they probably won't

401
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And all this other stuff, you know, I sometimes wonder

402
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I wonder if there's gonna be another video game crash

403
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And we're just gonna stop being fans of gaming

404
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And that's ultimately what's gonna probably end the show

405
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No, that's not gonna happen at all

406
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And here's why it's not gonna happen

407
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Because, you know, all that's gonna mean

408
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know, just because a console fails

409
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Or an idea fails

410
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Doesn't mean the whole industry's just gonna go belly up

411
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I mean, look at it

412
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's say the PlayStation 4 actually

413
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's say Sony is stupid enough to actually say

414
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay, we're gonna make this console streaming only

415
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Well, you've got other console manufacturers

416
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That don't necessarily have to follow that

417
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And, you know, we know that the Wii U's not gonna be that way

418
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So, I mean, that's just stupid right there

419
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So people just won't buy the PlayStation 4 instead

420
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's assume that all of them are really dumb

421
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And they all decided to go that way

422
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, hey, you know, you don't have to give up gaming

423
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I mean, hello, there are how many generations of fucking game systems

424
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You can't tell me you've played every single fucking game that's in existence

425
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I mean, there's plenty that keep you entertained until you're dead

426
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I mean, seriously, you don't need to

427
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's true, it's very true

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You don't need to buy brand new fucking games

429
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And, hello, you could go play on a PC

430
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Because none of that bullshit's there

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Or you could just... indie games

432
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah, indie games

433
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I mean, there's a ton of shit out there that you can be playing

434
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't need to be relying on

435
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, all these new systems have to be successful

436
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah, you won't have these really great games that are on consoles

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Because you don't want to stream everything, which is fine

438
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because I don't blame you

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And also, it's not going to work anyways

440
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Because why am I going to stream all this content to my system

441
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
And then hit my bandwidth caps for my internet providers

442
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We're just not in a world right now where it's viable to do that

443
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Hey, Comcast is up in that cap to 300, apparently

444
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Ooh, let me put it this way, okay

445
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I could be rampantly pirating for an entire month

446
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I wouldn't hit that cap, okay

447
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I mean, it's a large cap, but I haven't ever done, like, streaming constantly

448
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
With, you know, gaming and stuff

449
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And honestly, I don't want to do that

450
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I haven't tried it online, maybe I should

451
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
GameGuru in chat says

452
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't think there will be another game crash

453
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If anything crashes, it will only be the console industry

454
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Save Nintendo, who lived through that shit

455
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And I think...

456
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Nintendo didn't really live through it

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
At least not in America

458
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I mean, I can't speak to really Japan

459
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But they definitely didn't live through it in America

460
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Because the NES wasn't really out when the bottom fell out of the market

461
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I mean, that was mainly the Atari 2600 and just the oversaturation of games

462
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Especially the quality and the price that really drove things down

463
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But, I mean, I could...

464
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen in this next cycle of consoles that's coming out

465
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And it will be bad decisions that cause it to happen

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But, anyway, don't run around crying, you know,

467
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Oh, OLR threatens to end, no, cause funny enough

468
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I arrived at a similar conclusion that

469
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, we could always talk about classic games and food

470
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
There you go

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There's never gonna be nothing that we can't...

472
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I mean, just because, you know, it's...

473
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I mean, let's say the industry crashes

474
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What are we gonna have?

475
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Just real quick, Black Wolf clarifies

476
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The arcade games were out before the crash

477
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So, like, Donkey Kong and stuff was out around that time

478
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
There's plenty of stuff to talk about

479
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Anyway

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There's plenty of stuff

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
When I all of a sudden go,

482
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, I can't buy a new system

483
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I just hate games now

484
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm just gonna leave

485
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We would just have to change the format again

486
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But, anyway, I don't...

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's not go further down that road

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Cause that's not gonna happen for a long time

489
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And there are, you know, there are...

490
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm sure by the time the next E3 rolls around

491
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And we actually get to see these consoles and the offerings

492
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There'll be a little more excitement

493
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
At least I hope to hell there are

494
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If not, we'll talk about the Playstation 3 and the 360 a little longer

495
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
They're not gonna go streaming only

496
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's just not gonna happen

497
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Alright

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Live.vognetwork.com again if you want to participate along with the show

499
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And offer up your chat comments

500
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks

501
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Going back to the present a little bit

502
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Or maybe games, classic games that you've been playing this week

503
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Dark Soccer, if she was here, she told me to say this to you listeners

504
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
She would be talking about Garrus and more Garrus

505
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
She has been playing more Mass Effect 3

506
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I think she's about, she's at least halfway through the game

507
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
From what she'll be

508
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
She got to the romance, she did get to romance Garrus again

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
In part 3, I know that

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Her femshep and Garrus went on their little date

511
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And I think she's, it sounds to me like she's about half to two thirds way through the game

512
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So hopefully by next week's show

513
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Since you know cause she ain't here

514
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And she's at home recovering and resting her voice and all that

515
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
She's playing Mass Effect

516
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
She'll probably have that stuff beat by next week

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So we can ask her about the ending

518
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Anyway, so I know that's Dark Soccer's gaming week

519
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's go to Loki's gaming week

520
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Well I started off by finishing up playing

521
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Ultimate Collector Garage Sale

522
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Which is the game that's tied in with that Ready Player One contest

523
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Fucking hated that game

524
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Ever fired my body so I

525
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Wanted to get that out of the way

526
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And I did, I finally got the DeLorean in game

527
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Got my, you know

528
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Leaderboard position

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And have the new website for the

530
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Last challenge which will open up on Wednesday August 1st

531
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well actually technically Tuesday night

532
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Cause it's Eastern time

533
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Which I've already made plans on how I'm going to tackle that

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Including staying up all night if I have to

535
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Cause that's the one that's actually gonna count

536
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Cause right now it doesn't really matter what your position is

537
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Even though it was number 14 for the second challenge

538
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I was gonna say

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I heard that you placed like 14

540
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So does that mean you're number 14 like overall right now?

541
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It doesn't matter, it's just for fun

542
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The leaderboard is just how fast you completed the second one

543
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But it's really the last one because

544
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's whoever completed the first two challenges

545
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And whoever finishes the last one first

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Is gonna be it

547
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And they said it's really hard the last challenge but

548
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I mean we'll see

549
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I bet it's gonna be something like

550
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's gonna be like Super Meat Boy Hard

551
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Or like the Impossible Game

552
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Or VVVV but like even harder

553
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I hope it is something like that

554
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Cause I've actually played quite a bit of that stuff

555
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I bet it's gonna be one of those style of games

556
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's gonna just make you wanna poke your eyeball out like

557
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't care that'd be fun

558
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And you know what I'd rather have it be that

559
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Than wanting to poke my eyeballs out

560
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
For playing that stupid Ultimate Collector thing

561
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Which is so goddamn boring

562
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There is a trick to it I mean

563
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You just have to get a lot of friends on Facebook

564
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That are playing that

565
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And so I did that and

566
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You know I was able to

567
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Cause you can send energy to each other

568
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And that's how you can do it without having to pay anything

569
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I have to play this a little bit

570
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Cause this is a link that

571
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Alan sent me on my Facebook this week

572
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's off of Tumblr and it's credited

573
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The source is KidXForever

574
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I have no idea it's Tumblr

575
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can never tell how this works and who gets credit for it

576
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But here you go

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's somebody playing the impossible game

578
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And giving their commentary

579
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And this is what I picture Loki is gonna sound like

580
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
During that final gate competition

581
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh it says Achievement Hunter

582
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh yeah it's that Rooster Teeth thing

583
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh okay then there you go it's Rooster Teeth

584
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So here you go

585
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let me play a little bit of this here if I can

586
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So they're hopping along to the bricks

587
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He'll fuck up here in a minute

588
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That looks pretty hard

589
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's probably the type of thing you're gonna have to play

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
FUCK!

591
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Holy shit this is way harder than the original

592
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This is like two seconds

593
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
This is the beginning of the fucking level

594
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And it's like double spikes, triple spikes

595
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Fucking shit you gotta jump over

596
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's fast as fuck too

597
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Damn it! Come on you fuck, come on you fuck

598
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
JUMP- GOD DAMN IT MOTHERFUCKER

599
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I always fuck up that last part

600
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
By last part I mean the end of the very first fucking-

601
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Okay the video goes on like that for like five minutes

602
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But that's totally gonna be you that night

603
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Playing that game

604
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
GOD DAMN IT

605
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
They just fucking did this so they don't have to fucking give the DeLorean away

606
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Mother fuckers

607
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
First that fucking Facebook game and now this shit

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
On top of the DeLorean thing

609
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's just, you know

610
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Let's say I won that thing

611
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'd have to still fucking drive to L.A.

612
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
And pay the taxes

613
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And pay whatever goddamn registration

614
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Insurance

615
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
All that shit

616
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It sounds like a big pain in the ass actually

617
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
But I still wanna win

618
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Cause who doesn't wanna win?

619
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Who doesn't wanna win? Exactly

620
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Speaking of which, that reminds me actually

621
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There's a Call of Duty 3 tournament down here in Stockton

622
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
One of my customers is actually having it

623
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And I need to find someone to play with me

624
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Cause none of my friends wanna go

625
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And that kinda sucks

626
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Anyone that listens that's in Sacramento

627
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That happens to be somewhat good at

628
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

629
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey, you might be interested in

630
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And that ain't me

631
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You know, interested in going down

632
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
See, cause I thought my old coworker might wanna do it

633
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But he has his kids, you know, they're divorced

634
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And they're shared custody

635
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So he has his kids on that Saturday

636
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Cause we'd fucking tear that shit up

637
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Wait, so you have to have like a partner?

638
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, so I think it's a two on two

639
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So if you wanna team up with Loki

640
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You gotta be local though

641
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You gotta be local

642
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And don't be scary

643
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, Stockton's scary enough

644
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We don't need any scary people

645
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Meeting me down there

646
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
At least that's what I'm thinking right now

647
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I haven't really discussed with the wife yet

648
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But you know

649
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, cause I wanted to see if I could even get someone

650
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Cause you know, what's the point

651
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Me just going down there

652
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But it might be fun

653
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There's cash prizes involved

654
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Don't know if there's that many people

655
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Anyways, so other things to play this week

656
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Minecraft

657
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Playing Minecraft a lot

658
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I finally got the achievement for On a Rail

659
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Cause my rail system goes really far

660
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The other thing though

661
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is I'm not sure how

662
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Bobby was talking about that he got that achievement too

663
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And I was wondering in the back of my mind

664
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He did not

665
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Cause I didn't know he was building a big rail system

666
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He has an underwater rail system

667
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I actually saw there was a Minecraft thread

668
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
On the VoG forum that I saw his thing

669
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
No, but mine actually goes really

670
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Like all around the world

671
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm gonna get the achievement by just going to Loki's world

672
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That's fine, come on in

673
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm redoing the whole mine cart thing

674
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Cause before I used to have it where you push the switch

675
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And it would call the mine cart

676
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It just doesn't work now

677
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I was gonna have the mine carts just traveling around

678
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But I ran into a problem

679
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Where I accidentally

680
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I was trying to get into one of my mine carts

681
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And it caught one of the powered rails

682
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And just kept going

683
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I'm like, oh that's fine, I'll just catch up with it at the end

684
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And it never appeared

685
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So I'm like, does the game just lose track of these mine carts

686
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Cause that's gonna fuck up my entire system

687
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If I have these mine carts going around they just disappear

688
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Because, oh it's too far away

689
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That might be a problem

690
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I don't know what I'm gonna do there

691
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's an issue

692
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But yeah, it's been fun playing that

693
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And a little bit of Modern Warfare 3

694
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Let's play a little bit of that

695
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Bobby says the one that he built was actually above ground

696
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He couldn't get the underwater one to go long enough

697
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So there you go

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Alright, anything else you wanna share with your gaming week?

699
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Ah, that's it

700
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
My gaming week, I've actually still been playing

701
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
More Final Fantasy 11

702
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's kinda what I've been playing instead of WoW

703
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Cause there's really nothing to do in WoW right now

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Unless I wanna level in alt

705
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So I'm really kinda just burned out on it

706
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Playing with friends a little bit has been Final Fantasy
