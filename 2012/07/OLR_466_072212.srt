00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:19,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, July 22nd, 2012, has a hugely anticipated title been cancelled?

2
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:24,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft secretly steps up security, and Steam heads to another platform.

3
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:36,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:51,324
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here to talk about video games and the gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle with you guys who are participating live at the VOG Network.

6
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:55,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Live.VogNetwork.com to get in the chat room and chat with us.

[SPEAKER_10]: I know a lot of us listen to us on their Mondays to help get through the workday or throughout the week or what have you.

00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:07,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for tuning in and thanks for participating.

10
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:09,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, I'm doing good.

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,477
[SPEAKER_10]: You are playing a game over there that you're giggling like crazy over.

12
00:01:32,577 --> 00:01:33,017
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this?

13
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:34,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be the guy Gaiden.

14
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:35,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, dear.

15
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:36,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, dear.

16
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:41,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I want to be the guy was one of those like impossible games, right?

17
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like the look of it now because it's all 16-bit-ish now.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,680
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got a lot of homages.

19
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously, the first one had a lot of homages to stuff.

20
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,222
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, the first level is it's buying a Capando.

21
00:01:53,262 --> 00:01:54,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's pretty awesome.

22
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:57,944
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the appeal of these games that are just impossible to beat?

23
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:00,145
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not impossible, they're just really hard.

24
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Next to impossible.

25
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:02,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

26
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple reasons why I'm playing.

27
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:06,649
[SPEAKER_02]: One, because it's fun.

28
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's hard, but it's still fun.

29
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:18,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, because I'm thinking one of two things is going to happen for the next gate challenge for Ready Player One stuff.

30
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:22,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to either be a game that's hard like this, or it's going to be a text adventure game.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Be my guess.

32
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at either one of those.

33
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,784
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to go back and study up on Zork.

34
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:33,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much, yeah, because that was one of the challenges in the book was Zork.

35
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

36
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

37
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,031
[SPEAKER_10]: You are standing in front of a White House.

38
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,072
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a mailbox here.

39
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:40,532
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you do?

40
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:43,634
[SPEAKER_10]: Open mailbox.

41
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:45,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Take letter.

42
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You better read up on your FAQs for the old school Zork games.

43
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:51,549
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

44
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:57,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, also joining us here, since DarkSakura is not here, we like to invite other people to come on and host.

45
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:02,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have our old favorite standby host who doesn't have a choice because he lives here.

46
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Say hello to Alan.

47
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

48
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,040
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you, Alan?

49
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:06,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm great.

50
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

51
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you for coming back tonight.

52
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:09,702
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

53
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:10,563
[SPEAKER_10]: What's new with you?

54
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:14,144
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, I asked a bunch of people, I can't get a guest host.

55
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,045
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to do it.

56
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh, so I'm like sixth choice.

57
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:19,486
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great to hear.

58
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:23,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked one other person and then I was too lazy to ask anyone else.

59
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:24,428
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fair.

60
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, you know, tap, tap, tap.

61
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:26,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

62
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:32,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other person I asked was Flaco Jones, who, you know, to be fair, was here that night.

63
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,071
[SPEAKER_06]: He's bad luck.

64
00:03:33,231 --> 00:03:33,631
[SPEAKER_06]: He's me.

65
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,471
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes power go out.

66
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:35,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's true.

67
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's best you stay away.

68
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:37,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Stay away, Flaco Jones.

69
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:37,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

70
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:38,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

71
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:38,513
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

72
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:40,614
[SPEAKER_10]: But he has like babies and things.

73
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:45,736
[SPEAKER_10]: When you have babies and things, priorities and all this stuff.

74
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:48,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand.

75
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:54,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show at live.vognetwork.com.

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft starts us off tonight.

77
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, the host without a choice.

78
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,460
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

79
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:45,503
[SPEAKER_10]: but Tiara and Dan are both two of the big writers at the site Geek Life or geek-life.com and we've done a lot of stuff with them over the years they've been really wonderful in promoting us and we've tried to promote them where we can they got married today geek-life.com a geek wedding happened today in Las Vegas and of course since Jamie and Tiara go way back she flew down there for the wedding so I think that's great

80
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,363
[SPEAKER_02]: What geek theme did they have for the wedding?

81
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:51,044
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they had like a giant Doctor Who... It's Doctor Who everything.

82
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's like they had like a giant Doctor Who TARDIS cardboard thing.

83
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:58,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cake topper is them.

84
00:04:58,346 --> 00:04:58,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

85
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:01,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it might be Amy and what's his name?

86
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're... Yeah, it's kind of like them as... Because Amy's got red hair and Tiara's got red hair.

87
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

88
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,727
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like them as Doctor Who characters.

89
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:12,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can read more about it at geek-life.com because Tiara does a series called Bride and the Geek.

90
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it Beauty and the Geek?

91
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:14,729
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

92
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:17,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I sound like a terrible person because I don't know the name.

93
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's Beauty and the Geek, actually.

94
00:05:19,714 --> 00:05:26,662
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's about them setting up and planning their wedding, and I thought it was a really cute series, even if the name escapes me right now because I'm under pressure.

95
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:31,427
[SPEAKER_10]: But DarkSakura will be back next week, but we can certainly understand.

96
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,510
[SPEAKER_10]: She wanted to go to the bachelorette party, which looked like it was last night.

97
00:05:35,452 --> 00:05:45,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think they checked into a chocolate place So, you know, with girls If they're not going to go see the stripper thing and do that What do girls love more than strippers?

98
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:51,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Chocolate So it makes sense that they would go to a chocolate place Of which I guess there is one in Vegas

99
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:54,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

100
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:58,914
[SPEAKER_10]: ImmortalKing in our chatroom says, DarkSakura too busy dodging the bouquet.

101
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,255
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, DarkSakura is married.

102
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:03,816
[SPEAKER_10]: She's talked about her husband, Dan, several times on the show.

103
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:08,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that makes you ineligible to even go out to the floor when they ask, where are the single ladies?

104
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Put your hands up.

105
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,361
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so DarkSakura would not qualify to catch the bouquet.

106
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:19,468
[SPEAKER_10]: I will point out that I did catch the garter at a wedding a couple years ago.

107
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,052
[SPEAKER_10]: That was when Mel and Mel got married.

108
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:23,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I caught the garter.

109
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,957
[SPEAKER_10]: So, still waiting.

110
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,822
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, I've caught the garter before too.

111
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:58,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright Let's see Also in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com TigerClaw says What Sky is trying to say is Tonight's show is a sausage fest Maybe, but we will open it up to callers later on And maybe some lovely ladies will call in Because I know we do have some gals that listen to OLR Or maybe we'll get some emails Or some tweets From all genders later on So we'll find out We'll probably just get Jim Sally

112
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:00,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Steam sale!

113
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:24,773
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

114
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:30,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to talk about how has the Steam sale damaged your life or your wallet?

115
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:32,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Steam sale going on.

116
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it ends tomorrow.

117
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:36,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that means tomorrow at 10 a.m.

118
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:40,059
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's done or if that means there's like one last final hurrah.

119
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my meta achievement of voting on the community's choice every day of the sale today.

120
00:07:48,623 --> 00:07:49,804
[SPEAKER_10]: That means today's last day.

121
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:50,284
[SPEAKER_10]: That's that.

122
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it says prices through the 23rd.

123
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think today's sales are going to run through like 2 p.m.

124
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:55,627
[SPEAKER_06]: tomorrow.

125
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:56,788
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think it's going to be over.

126
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:57,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, then it's over.

127
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:03,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there were some like from yesterday that expired in eight hours from when I bought them earlier.

128
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:07,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably, yeah, through tomorrow.

129
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,284
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I wanted to go around and see how did the Steam sale wreck your wallet this week?

130
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, how did the Steam sale wreck your wallet?

131
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:22,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before I had purchased Skyrim and Borderlands, actually it was pretty good this week.

132
00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:30,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost bought Earth Defense Force, Insect Armageddon, but then I remembered how much I... It was a fun game, but it's not worth owning twice.

133
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:36,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike, you know, Earth Defense Force 2017, which I owned a lot of times.

134
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:44,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought Arma 2, the pack they had.

135
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,766
[SPEAKER_02]: It was with Arma 2 and the expansion for like $20.

136
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:50,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I got that.

137
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:55,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost considered San Andreas, but I don't want it.

138
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:57,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

139
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,054
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

140
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:20,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, so Arma 2 is only the new thing that I bought.

141
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:26,201
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I'm looking forward to checking out DayZ, which is that zombie, uh, thing that they've got.

142
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:29,483
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be all sorts of craziness and boring at the same time.

143
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't the orange box half, like, every Half-Life thing?

144
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:37,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Episode 1, and Episode 2, and, well, and then the original game.

145
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, Portal and Team Fortress 2, but...

146
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to play through Portal again because I've played through that a few times.

147
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:47,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure Alan would tell you Half-Life is the best thing you're going to get.

148
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:52,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really... I play Half-Life 2 and the episodes like twice a year.

149
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is with that is they mark this stuff down all the time.

150
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like, oh, I missed my only opportunity for this.

151
00:09:59,225 --> 00:09:59,425
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

152
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously they mark this stuff down all the time and I'm sure if I go to a GameStop or something like that I'm sure they got a copy of the orange box on PC or even Half-Life 2 just sitting there rotting that I could probably take off their hands for you know nothing let me ask a completely random tangential question because we're talking about Half-Life and you know I know that it seems like Valve is trolling you with Half-Life 3 right Alan

153
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,575
[SPEAKER_06]: either Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 Episode 3 whatever they want to do.

154
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:33,338
[SPEAKER_10]: But it seems like nothing's ever going to happen, right?

155
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:41,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's now been longer from Half-Life Episode 2 to current day than it was from Half-Life 1 to Half-Life 2.

156
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:47,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you worry that if Half-Life 3 ever does come out at some point that it's going to be like Diablo 3?

157
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:59,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I mean by that is I think most people, not all, but most people kind of consider Diablo 3 a letdown for a variety of reasons, be it that auction house or the lack of offline play or something.

158
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:04,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only reason why there hasn't been Half-Life 3 is because they need to develop a new engine.

159
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've been using the Source engine forever now, so it's time that they come out with a new engine.

160
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:10,213
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

161
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:21,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of the series Lost and how weird it was.

162
00:11:23,068 --> 00:11:26,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the fans were like, they totally know how it's going to end.

163
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:30,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other half of the fans were like, they're making this shut up as they go along.

164
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:35,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Half-Life, I'm afraid the story might get too big for them to rein in.

165
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And the story might be weird.

166
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:40,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But otherwise, it's just going to be a first-person shooter.

167
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:41,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

168
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:48,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Valve's pedigree is very high, so I don't really expect them to drop the ball that much on it.

169
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:53,465
[SPEAKER_10]: GameGuru in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com seems to agree with Loki.

170
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:57,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Half-Life 3 will come out if and only if they create a new engine for their games.

171
00:11:58,006 --> 00:11:58,627
[SPEAKER_10]: They need a Source 2.

172
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they are going to create a new engine for their game because it's getting dated.

173
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:10,810
[SPEAKER_02]: They make good games and the engine still looks pretty nice, but they're going to need to come out with something at some point.

174
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,871
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have to happen because it's going to get dated.

175
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:22,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because Source as it is, which the first generation of it was 2003 or 2004 when Half-Life 2 came out, it's been updated four or five times.

176
00:12:22,924 --> 00:12:23,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

177
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:26,107
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still the core engine.

178
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:27,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what's running Portal 2?

179
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:28,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

180
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:28,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

181
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Modified Source and Left 4 Dead 2 is also Modified Source.

182
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:34,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2, they both still look great.

183
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:38,599
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand the desire to... It's the physics and stuff.

184
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,840
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all the same.

185
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,262
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Valve is waiting for the next wave of consoles.

186
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:44,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe at this point, don't make a PlayStation 3 game.

187
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:48,007
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need to come out with a game that's just all the source games kind of combined into one.

188
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:51,290
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a little bit of Half-Life, you got a little bit of Portal in there, a little bit of Left 4 Dead.

189
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a mixing of everything.

190
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,894
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of Team Fortress 2.

191
00:12:56,514 --> 00:13:01,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Half-Life 2 Episode 3 was supposed to heavily involve Aperture Science.

192
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:18,684
[SPEAKER_06]: and because Portal was such a huge hit, it almost makes me wonder if they're like, if they want to keep those worlds separate now because you're supposed to go up to the North Pole or the South Pole to find the ship and blah, blah, blah.

193
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:24,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Aperture Science was supposed to be in Episode 3 and now I don't know if they're trying to write their way around that.

194
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:27,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Because of all the story in Portal 2 about Aperture Science, certainly.

195
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:30,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that could be an interesting monkey wrench.

196
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, I didn't mean to get us too far on the tangent.

197
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go back to how Steam sale wrecked your week.

198
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:38,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else, Loki, that you bought on the sale?

199
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:39,510
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was it.

200
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Just those three games.

201
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:41,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go.

202
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:53,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought Civilization V for Alan because just like how I bully him into coming on this show, clearly, I'm going to talk to him about playing Civ V with me.

203
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:54,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't you excited?

204
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:55,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

205
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I installed it.

206
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:57,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray!

207
00:13:58,118 --> 00:13:59,178
[SPEAKER_10]: That's progress.

208
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:08,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought Civ V Gods and Kings for myself because it was like 20% off, which I figured for a game that's only like two months old is probably as low as it's going to get.

209
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:09,366
[SPEAKER_10]: So I bought that.

210
00:14:09,886 --> 00:14:16,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And I bought a four pack of Dungeon Defenders because it was cheap and I heard it's kind of good.

211
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,112
[SPEAKER_10]: So I bought that.

212
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Why'd you buy four of them?

213
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,494
[SPEAKER_10]: so that I could give Alan one, and I gave one to Shane.

214
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,635
[SPEAKER_10]: What is Dungeon Defenders anyway?

215
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't decided what I'm doing with the fourth one yet.

216
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It's co-op tower defense, I think.

217
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:28,916
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds fun.

218
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you not have it, Loki?

219
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:31,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have it.

220
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:32,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now you do.

221
00:14:32,157 --> 00:14:33,237
[SPEAKER_10]: There's my fourth copy.

222
00:14:33,298 --> 00:14:34,018
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

223
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:34,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought it for Loki.

224
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it for you, bro.

225
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:37,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

226
00:14:37,439 --> 00:14:37,839
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

227
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:38,479
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

228
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:42,140
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one genre I haven't really gotten into, tower defense stuff.

229
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, I guess I have.

230
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I play the stick war games on iOS, but I don't know.

231
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:47,282
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be fun.

232
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,363
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

233
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:50,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm trying to think.

234
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:51,623
[SPEAKER_10]: There was something else.

235
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:51,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

236
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:55,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought Skyrim, which I think I talked about on last week's show.

237
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:56,245
[SPEAKER_10]: My memory is a little fuzzy.

238
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,466
[SPEAKER_10]: But I bought Skyrim on PC just because I wanted to be able to mod it.

239
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:05,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I had it on PlayStation 3, but it's just not PC.

240
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:09,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And I got to say, after installing that high-res texture pack and everything...

241
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:11,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

242
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

243
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice looking game.

244
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And all the mods are very cool.

245
00:15:16,822 --> 00:15:19,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Steam Workshop, and it's very easy to get that stuff in there.

246
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,126
[SPEAKER_10]: And Alan, Alan's great.

247
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,928
[SPEAKER_10]: He sent me an email saying like, okay, here are the must-have mods.

248
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,429
[SPEAKER_10]: You need this and this and this and this.

249
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:27,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And he just gave me a list.

250
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,671
[SPEAKER_06]: All quality of life stuff.

251
00:15:29,111 --> 00:15:33,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the default UI for inventory and spells is shit.

252
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:35,076
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a mod that makes it pretty.

253
00:15:35,096 --> 00:15:35,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

254
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:42,118
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw who's participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com says can your PC run Skyrim fine?

255
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:43,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's running great.

256
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:48,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's like the highest highest settings but my video card's fairly new.

257
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,520
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only about a year old and you know I have a fairly powerful PC.

258
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,480
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just very loud.

259
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only problem with my PC is that when the fans are running You should hear mine because it's under the desk.

260
00:15:58,482 --> 00:15:59,262
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's muted.

261
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:00,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's a beast.

262
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:04,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Your PC's way better than mine and I run games fine so you shouldn't have a problem.

263
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:12,265
[SPEAKER_02]: My PC at home, I need to upgrade everything on it because that was back when the 8800 NVIDIA cards were new.

264
00:16:13,365 --> 00:16:27,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a dual 8800 GTS 512s running an SLI and have a dual core because it was a core 2.0 before they had all these i5s, i7s, and stuff like that.

265
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's overclocked to almost 4 gigs.

266
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

267
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,530
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, those cards kind of hold it back.

268
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:45,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby Blackwolf, who tapes before us at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 Eastern at VODnetwork.com every Sunday night, is sending a link.

269
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw your tweet on this earlier, Bobby.

270
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,691
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how I know what this is.

271
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:57,173
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the Minecraft mod for Skyrim that actually changes your companion to Steve, the Minecraft dude and all that, which is funny.

272
00:16:57,193 --> 00:17:01,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just afraid once I do start modding this is it's going to get weird really fast.

273
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm going to have to get the Macho Man dragon mod.

274
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:08,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I got to get that still.

275
00:17:08,438 --> 00:17:09,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for reminding me.

276
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:18,344
[SPEAKER_02]: That one also, a quick, I guess a... We actually have somebody in chat too named Macho Man, so maybe you'll get an oh yeah.

277
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:27,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's also, you know, in case you're not a Macho Man fan, they have the Milo Pony ones that turn the dragons into that.

278
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:30,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And the extra magic one is pretty cool.

279
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's just be real.

280
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:34,632
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for the weed smokers.

281
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,613
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the brony mod for the weed smokers.

282
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

283
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying.

284
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:49,256
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to see what kind of... I mean, it's going to look nothing... That's the fun of it.

285
00:17:49,296 --> 00:17:50,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I've played Skyrim.

286
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:50,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Skyrim's fun.

287
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still playing it on 360.

288
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:56,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't picked up DLC because I think it's a waste of money right now.

289
00:17:56,878 --> 00:18:04,560
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to make the PC version look nothing like the original game and just have it be frigging crazy.

290
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Just batshit crazy.

291
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:13,089
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf is also asking in chat, can Alan post his essential Skyrim mod list to the forums?

292
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I've actually been trying to nudge him into doing an article for the site on that.

293
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:18,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Nudge, nudge, nudge, nudge.

294
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:20,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I talk about the Steam Workshop?

295
00:18:21,163 --> 00:18:21,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.

296
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:30,608
[SPEAKER_06]: As someone who likes to mod PC games, the Steam Workshop is amazing in how incredibly easy it is to just install a mod.

297
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:32,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't like it, it's gone.

298
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,690
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a one-click process within Steam.

299
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,992
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem that I have with it is that a lot of really awesome mod authors...

300
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:45,898
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't on it just because they're fine with Nexus, which was the old school modding site.

301
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:51,444
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of amazing Skyrim mods, especially UI and quality of life stuff, that isn't on the Steam Workshop.

302
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:58,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I make a list, I can say, here's how you install stuff from Nexus, but here's the easy stuff from Steam Workshop.

303
00:18:58,951 --> 00:18:59,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

304
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:00,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's okay.

305
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,376
[SPEAKER_10]: I have faith that most of our listeners could figure it out.

306
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

307
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:13,403
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people are intimidated by modding, and the Steam Workshop is absolutely an amazing progression.

308
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:17,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very innovative on that stuff, but it kind of split the community up a bit.

309
00:19:18,107 --> 00:19:19,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now there's two different sources for mods.

310
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:23,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft is trying to share this mod that he says I should get called the Yay Mod.

311
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:26,793
[SPEAKER_10]: He says, screw the Macho Man mod, get the Yay Mod.

312
00:19:26,813 --> 00:19:28,014
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, dear God, what is that?

313
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:28,995
[SPEAKER_10]: And he sent me a YouTube.

314
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:32,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually I don't play YouTubes on the show without looking at them first, but...

315
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:59,982
[SPEAKER_10]: for yay mod, I'll take a risk Actdeft, don't ruin my show here we go, let's see so the guy's in the dungeon let's see what happens if you don't know the elements of good cheer yet you should try out these cheat codes I don't know what that's gonna do alright Actdeft, when does this get good uh oh, the guy's typing it in let's see what happens

316
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:04,447
[SPEAKER_10]: This video's only a minute and a half long.

317
00:20:08,429 --> 00:20:08,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

318
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:15,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

319
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:17,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing good's happening.

320
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:23,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, you're bringing the show- He should've just gave you a timestamp and said bump it to like a minute five.

321
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm more interested in this because everything's in German right now.

322
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:37,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure dragon shouts in German are terrifying.

323
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:44,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I just realized it says My Little Pony Friendship is Magic in the title, so I'm a little worried.

324
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:50,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I might need to smoke a little bit of something before this will actually make sense.

325
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:51,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the trick?

326
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:54,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-oh.

327
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably a dragon shout that's My Little Pony.

328
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's now a dragon shout that says yay.

329
00:20:59,703 --> 00:20:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

330
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Now to the fun part with 10 seconds left in the video.

331
00:21:04,602 --> 00:21:06,243
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

332
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:06,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

333
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:16,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I give that on a scale of 1 to 10 about a 1.5.

334
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Actdeft.

335
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,871
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a stoppage of the show.

336
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:25,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Bobby Blackwolf in chat said, Wolf rather, that he's installed mods from Nexus.

337
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:36,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Nexus does have its own little Nexus mod manager app, but a lot of people are like, I don't want to install this 5 meg little weird-ass app.

338
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:41,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So it kind of has a Steam Workshop alternative, but yeah, I can post all that through the forums.

339
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:42,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

340
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:43,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

341
00:21:44,186 --> 00:22:01,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and another thing about the Steam Workshop, and this is because I'm a huge pervert, sometimes mods, modders, especially in like the Grand Theft Auto franchise, like to make people naked or make their clothes really slutty, even if you strip them and they still have underwear on, just like cleavage and the big boobs.

342
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:04,351
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not, that stuff's not on Steam Workshop.

343
00:22:04,711 --> 00:22:11,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want an NC-17 R-rated Skyrim like I do, you're going to want to go to Nexus for that.

344
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,461
[SPEAKER_02]: They do some good work on Lydia.

345
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:21,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a bunch of Lydia mods where it's not appropriate for this show.

346
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:25,223
[SPEAKER_10]: This show is appropriate for everything.

347
00:22:25,863 --> 00:22:27,824
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't a Bobby Blackwolf show, Alan.

348
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:31,825
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some deep cleavage for those characters.

349
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:33,125
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

350
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, what was the damage for you this week?

351
00:22:36,008 --> 00:22:37,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know you went shopping.

352
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:37,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

353
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I think from the very first day of the sale, I think it's dinged me collectively for I want to say 50 or 55 bucks.

354
00:22:46,738 --> 00:22:49,881
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's 350 here, 899 here.

355
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,984
[SPEAKER_06]: The big thing that I got was Saints Row 3.

356
00:22:54,205 --> 00:23:10,474
[SPEAKER_06]: was knocked down to like $7.49 and then that plus all of the DLC all of it I think was like $22.99 so I picked that up just inhaled all that down spoiler most of the DLC sucks actually spoiler all of the DLC sucks

357
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:18,891
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I noticed, and you're the one who pointed this out, there's the daily sales that actually last about two hours.

358
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:23,194
[SPEAKER_06]: There are the flash sales and then there are the community vote sales.

359
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:30,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Those prices have been cycling through every day or like twice a day every other day for the whole sale.

360
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,584
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a genius move on Valve's part because it makes it look like they're putting all this stuff constantly on sale.

361
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:43,689
[SPEAKER_10]: But all it is, they have the daily sales, and the votes and the flash sales are just the same things as the daily sales, just cycling through at random.

362
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:52,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, if the thing that you voted on for the community sale didn't win, it's probably going to be a part of the daily sale the next day or the day after, or it'll be one of the flash sales at the bottom.

363
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to get...

364
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:58,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, remember that for Christmas because it's too late now.

365
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember when Civ V, I think, was like, what, eight bucks?

366
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were like, fuck, I missed Civ V for eight bucks.

367
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:06,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been eight bucks like three separate times since that you said that.

368
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:07,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

369
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:09,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So they keep bringing those prices back and making us think they're unique.

370
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:10,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

371
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:16,527
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so I think we've talked enough about our Steam addiction this week and the stuff we've bought.

372
00:24:16,908 --> 00:24:19,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get into a similar topic because it's how we always start the show.

373
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,571
[SPEAKER_10]: How was your gaming week?

374
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:25,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the Steam sale is just about buying a bunch of games.

375
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,733
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't mean you're going to play them.

376
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:29,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So what did you actually play this week?

377
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:30,816
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

378
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:33,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I have to make one more purchase here real quick.

379
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:34,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, what happened?

380
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:35,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Cause 2 is $3.74.

381
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,059
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is fucking awesome.

382
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:40,862
[SPEAKER_02]: for $3.74.

383
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:41,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to buy that.

384
00:24:42,123 --> 00:24:43,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed Gabe Newell.

385
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:43,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed him.

386
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:44,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stop.

387
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:55,875
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I... See, like, before, like, was it the stupid indie... I blame the humble indie bundles because, goddammit, I didn't have, you know, Steam and all this shit before that and now...

388
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:05,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm sucked into this... Alright, well I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but I am going to say pause for a minute and tell us about your gaming week first.

389
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:23,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this week I played Borderlands, because I picked it up on the same sale on PC, so I've been kind of going back and replaying that again since I want to kind of remember a little bit of what happens for the sequel, so that I can bust that out when it comes out in September.

390
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:24,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

391
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:27,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.

392
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

393
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I went ahead and modded it again.

394
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:37,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I've actually played that game, so they've patched it a few more times and you can't do some of the really cool guns that you had before.

395
00:25:37,892 --> 00:25:43,273
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's still some pretty awesome ones in there that you can mod.

396
00:25:43,673 --> 00:25:44,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have some of those.

397
00:25:44,693 --> 00:25:47,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a pistol now that takes people's heads off and stuff.

398
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,476
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:03,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario World World Select

400
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:39,800
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't like the fact that you can't stop moving in that because it's you know you push left to right and your guy just keeps walking and there's a spot where you have to kind of sit still before you know you do something um so it's a little annoying but I'm sure it's on like that on purpose

401
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:44,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2

402
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:02,335
[SPEAKER_02]: My class that I'm going to be using for the tournament.

403
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned last week, I'm going to be entering a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 tournament almost a week from today.

404
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It's next Saturday.

405
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:12,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that.

406
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:13,986
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be kind of fun.

407
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:15,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Driving down to Stockton.

408
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:17,698
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

409
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

410
00:27:51,860 --> 00:28:15,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, just, I think that was about, oh, I had been selling some stuff on eBay, and I guess I must have bought something on eBay not too long ago, because I had like $6 worth of, it was like $6.60 in eBay bucks that they have, you earn like, I don't remember what the ratio is, but you earn like free money, basically, so...

411
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:16,888
[SPEAKER_02]: I was bored one day.

412
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:19,249
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, I never really spend these.

413
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:23,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to find something that's gaming related under $6.60.

414
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try to find the best value for my money.

415
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:34,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was searching around and I actually found a digital copy of Child of Eden for $6.

416
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked that up because that's a no-brainer.

417
00:28:38,475 --> 00:28:42,356
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I'll get back to playing that on the 360 again.

418
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:42,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

419
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:47,869
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's all I played this week.

420
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:48,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

421
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll go next because I didn't play a lot of new games this week.

422
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:54,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I talked about most of the stuff in the Steam sale.

423
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:59,214
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't play enough Dungeon Defenders to really review it yet, so I'll come back to that next week.

424
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:06,537
[SPEAKER_10]: I did play a little bit of Civ V, Gods and Kings, but you have to really book out a chunk of time to play that game.

425
00:29:07,157 --> 00:29:11,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I started playing it, and I didn't really have a whole lot of time, and I was playing sloppy.

426
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:15,220
[SPEAKER_10]: For some reason, I decided to go for a military victory, and I never do military victories.

427
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:29,677
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was spreading myself too thin on all fronts so I was getting my butt kicked on like an easy level and I was like forget it stop delete I'll come back to this later so yeah didn't really get to do a whole lot there played a little bit of WoW

428
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:35,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 online on PC, and I gotta admit, I'm a little disappointed.

429
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:37,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.

430
00:29:37,584 --> 00:29:38,605
[SPEAKER_10]: You all know... Go ahead.

431
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:40,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Say it double fold.

432
00:29:40,306 --> 00:29:41,027
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two reasons.

433
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:45,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one reason for me, two reasons for you on why it's shitty and why you're not gonna play it anymore.

434
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

435
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:51,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I'm threatening not to play it anymore, but I think we all know somebody will be like, please come play with me.

436
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:58,400
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll be like okay but I'm just I'm really frustrated and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.

437
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:10,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Origin and I hate to say this because I know people that work at Origin but it's not good like I'm sorry I can't I'm really frustrated with it and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.

438
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:13,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm consistently having an origin and this whole

439
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:13,930
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

440
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:34,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Go in.

441
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We can play our own separate matches.

442
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:40,988
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do co-op with two public pugs that we let in through the public match.

443
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

444
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:50,654
[SPEAKER_06]: But Origin, its network kernel, can only keep track of one IP with two sessions on it.

445
00:30:50,835 --> 00:30:53,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't do it for another IP with two sessions on it.

446
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:59,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we try to play with our friends who are in the exact same setup as us, the third person could get on.

447
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:01,983
[SPEAKER_06]: But when the fourth person tries, they time out.

448
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:08,110
[SPEAKER_06]: or if the match is already in progress, it will time out the person at their house while the fourth person tries to get in.

449
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this makes no sense at this point.

450
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:13,016
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, TLDR, it's shitty.

451
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It's shitty and it's peer-to-peer, which is why it has this problem.

452
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:19,565
[SPEAKER_06]: XBLA and I think PSN is all server-based.

453
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:45,134
[SPEAKER_10]: so the matching service on Mass Effect 3 is peer-to-peer and that's why it has all these problems and let me tell you what I've had to put up with to play what is otherwise a great game again I don't get into online shooter games ever but Mass Effect 3 which isn't really a shooter but it kind of is like it has defied that trend but what I have to do to play this fucking game on Origin log into the game wait while it connects to Origin

454
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:48,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, game is connected to Origin.

455
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:49,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the menu's up.

456
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:55,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait while it loads my Galacticness Ready readiness rating or whatever it's called.

457
00:31:55,335 --> 00:31:57,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now select multiplayer.

458
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait for multiplayer to load.

459
00:31:59,436 --> 00:32:00,676
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let me connect to my friend.

460
00:32:00,996 --> 00:32:02,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait to connect to the friend.

461
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:05,297
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes like four minutes to get into a freaking match.

462
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:13,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet what it's doing for those first two big lags when it opens up the Galacticness Ready, I bet that's all like the DRM Origin security stuff going through.

463
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,960
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotta be.

464
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:43,239
[SPEAKER_10]: which is ridiculous like it's stop like do it once do it once every 10 connections just stop bogging my game down because it's really ruining it for me and then what really just set me over the edge was that we played a game the other night it was me you and our friend Tim we were three manning some bronze maps which we can do to full extraction and we were playing those online we played two matches and I got about 30,000 credits I leveled one guy to from 19 to 20 and another my engineer from like one to six and

465
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, lost all that.

466
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,722
[SPEAKER_10]: After I disconnected from the match, lost it all.

467
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:48,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Rolled back.

468
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:50,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Wrote EA customer support.

469
00:32:50,564 --> 00:32:51,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Please give me back what I lost.

470
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:52,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a reply back.

471
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:54,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, can't do that.

472
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,148
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can do it.

473
00:32:56,228 --> 00:33:00,590
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to because you think I'm trying to, you know, get it from you or steal it from you.

474
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:02,832
[SPEAKER_10]: This is ridiculous and I'm kind of over it.

475
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:03,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

476
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:06,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox has its share of connection problems too, honestly.

477
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:13,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Because with Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, aside from the galactic readiness and the first player part of it, there's the challenge.

478
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:21,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, aside from the challenge of shooting shit, you get credits and you buy these goody packs and you unlock new characters.

479
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:24,561
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why people play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

480
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:25,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they want to play as a Vorcha.

481
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,982
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to play as an Asari.

482
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:57,383
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you're not getting your credits that's that's why you're playing is to buy unless you want to get Bioware points but which I refuse to do yeah so and then I have saved up for so many of these packs and then this gets into a little bit of like you know it's not fair the game's not fair I have yet I've unlocked two characters out of like the and the way you unlock stuff is ridiculous because it's all RNG you you buy a goodie box and then pray you get the shit you want in it and it's totally random and

483
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:04,109
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Osfer says in our chatroom, just calm down and play the game on 360 after the show tonight.

484
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:05,910
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have a proper multiplayer game.

485
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can play it on PC, you can play it on 360.

486
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:17,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, I mean, I'm not saying no to like playing games on 360, but like all these issues, no matter what platform, I'm kind of like over Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and I'm ready for a new game.

487
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm ready for some single player content.

488
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,039
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we're going to play Borderlands.

489
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

490
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:23,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

491
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Civ 5.

492
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

493
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:25,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

494
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:39,850
[SPEAKER_02]: you realize Borderlands 2 you can play split screen on one Xbox 360 system and then also with that split screen play against other people we can do co-op and you can both play on the same TV

495
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:43,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to the Borderlands 2.

496
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to check out Borderlands 1 again.

497
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:48,640
[SPEAKER_10]: I only played it a little bit before and got distracted.

498
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,701
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I'll definitely check that out.

499
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:50,421
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fantastic.

500
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:54,464
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that's my little Origin rant.

501
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:59,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It is setting EA as a company back.

502
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:03,289
[SPEAKER_10]: But of course, EA is doing it to themselves.

503
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,351
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, what can you do?

504
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Sigh.

505
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,206
[SPEAKER_10]: So, let's see.

506
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:11,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's it for my gaming week.

507
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I've ran it enough.

508
00:35:12,226 --> 00:35:12,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, how about you?

509
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:19,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3, we already talked about that plenty, so I'm not going to get into that.

510
00:35:20,028 --> 00:35:20,228
[SPEAKER_06]: L.A.

511
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Noire, which I've been playing.

512
00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:22,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm almost near the end.

513
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:31,151
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to beat it, not because it's boring, but I am using a FAQ so I can get everything the first time through and just follow the narrative of it.

514
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:36,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And with the FAQ, that game's kind of boring, whereas other games, if you follow a FAQ, you still...

515
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Have the mechanics of it keeping it fun.

516
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,699
[SPEAKER_06]: So a shitload of L.A.

517
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:43,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Noire.

518
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to the Steam sale, it was dirt cheap.

519
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:48,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got it for like 10, 12 bucks with it and all the DLC cases.

520
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:50,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoying that.

521
00:35:52,266 --> 00:35:54,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing Saints Row the 3rd.

522
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:59,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on the mission where you parachute onto the top of the building and Kanye West is playing.

523
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:03,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like an hour or so in.

524
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:09,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Played a lot with the character creator in that.

525
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,802
[SPEAKER_02]: You have that game on PC, right?

526
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:16,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You might check Gentlemen of the Row.

527
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:20,948
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of cool enhancements and stuff for both Saints Row 2 and Saints Row the 3rd.

528
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:22,208
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

529
00:36:41,814 --> 00:37:09,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I installed a game that I hadn't played in a couple years Postal 2 for anyone who remembers that it's actually it's a really it's incredibly vulgar and offensive in a lot of ways but it's a first person shooter it's you know dated seven days of the week I got the expansion so I was playing Postal 2 for some reason I'm like I just want to play a really offensive awful first person shooter I think oh um

530
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll make this a part of my gaming week.

531
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:24,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I decided to check out my PSP, my Slim, which has got custom firmware on it, just to see if there are any custom firmware updates up to date, maybe check out some of the UMDs I have.

532
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:38,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed when I turned it on that there's this weird spotting discoloration splotches around the border of my screen, and I googled it, and it turns out this is a known issue for older PSPs.

533
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:40,455
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't live here.

534
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,896
[SPEAKER_06]: In Sacramento, it's like 102 degrees outside right now.

535
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:48,058
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't live in San Bruno anymore where it's foggy, but this is a known issue.

536
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:53,220
[SPEAKER_06]: There's mold under my LCD between the glass and the backlit portion.

537
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a slight discoloration.

538
00:37:56,521 --> 00:38:00,662
[SPEAKER_06]: If Jamie was here, I'd have her take a picture of it and put it on the Flickr stream.

539
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:22,816
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw someone else but I guess yeah this is a thing you get mold under your it's when I'm actually playing when I'm actually playing like a bright game like crap of the rapper really any game it's the the colors and the movement doesn't really notice I don't really notice that much but on like just the crossbar the menu screen I'm like this sucks

540
00:38:23,556 --> 00:38:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's mold, though, because it's almost like just the LCD screen just kind of going out or something, because you can see if you turn it, it changes the colors and stuff of it.

541
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:36,546
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks...

542
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:40,015
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's, ooh, it's all splotchy.

543
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:40,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

544
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:41,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Gross.

545
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:42,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like a disease.

546
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:44,175
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like your PSP has shingles.

547
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,136
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to put it down.

548
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:46,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to get it.

549
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:54,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I've heard people say like, not that this is a fix for it, but someone, I was reading a forum post and someone was like, what if you put it under a UV light for like a day?

550
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:57,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Will the UV light kill the fungus under there?

551
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, I'm not doing that.

552
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:06,080
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's, if you have a PSP and it's been in your closet for a year because you don't play PSP anymore, turn it on and see if it's got,

553
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:09,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Weird splotches under it.

554
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:14,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I got 2000, haven't really powered it on in a long time.

555
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:16,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

556
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:18,632
[SPEAKER_06]: My PSP has crud.

557
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:19,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

558
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:20,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs antibiotics.

559
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just get a new screen if you wanted.

560
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:28,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, it's not like you leave that thing in the bathroom.

561
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:33,322
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like in the bathroom you might expect it to get moldy because you know the steam from the shower and all that.

562
00:39:33,342 --> 00:39:34,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been in the living room on our shelf.

563
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:36,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's weird.

564
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I last turned this on... It's dry here.

565
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:39,126
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even humid.

566
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:42,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I turned this on last around Christmas and it was fine.

567
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:44,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something that's happened within the last six months.

568
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,472
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm worried about my PSP now.

569
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because it's been years for yours.

570
00:39:47,473 --> 00:39:52,658
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to turn on the Vita every couple... You're still watching Netflix on the Vita, right?

571
00:39:53,078 --> 00:39:53,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

572
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:54,721
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, good.

573
00:39:55,582 --> 00:39:55,882
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

574
00:39:57,024 --> 00:40:00,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if that's it for your gaming week, let me get into housekeeping real quick and then we'll get into the news.

575
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Some quick housekeeping tonight.

576
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:08,762
[SPEAKER_10]: First off, the Summerfest for PlayStation Home is next week.

577
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:23,607
[SPEAKER_10]: You can read more about that at the VOG Network's website, vognetwork.com, but we will be live in PlayStation Home, kind of being there exploring in the Aurora space and meeting some people virtually as well as broadcasting at the same time.

578
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:29,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry though if you don't even have a PlayStation 3, nothing's going to change for you.

579
00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:33,691
[SPEAKER_10]: You just, you know, you won't be able to participate in going into home, but you're not going to miss anything.

580
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:36,252
[SPEAKER_10]: We're still broadcasting the way we always do and all that.

581
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of like we'll have a

582
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:50,319
[SPEAKER_10]: and some listeners that want to come into the home space.

583
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:51,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a lot of fun.

584
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, that's happening in the Aurora space during next week's Bobby Blackwolf show and our show.

585
00:40:56,542 --> 00:41:01,425
[SPEAKER_10]: For more information, there's a story right in the feature bar at vognetwork.com.

586
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:06,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, please don't forget to add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

587
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:10,027
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are also on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

588
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:11,487
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a giveaway tonight.

589
00:41:11,527 --> 00:41:19,489
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do a giveaway in part B. And tonight we are giving away, thanks to one of our listeners, and I really appreciate it, Boshka.

590
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,429
[SPEAKER_10]: One of our listeners is giving this away.

591
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:24,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can tune in to his blog.

592
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's CritCraft is what it's called.

593
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,190
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going off the top of my head.

594
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:30,391
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to credit his blog for providing this.

595
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:34,593
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a beta key for Ravaged.

596
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Ravaged was a Kickstarter funded project and it's now in beta.

597
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:39,976
[SPEAKER_10]: All you need is you need Steam.

598
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:46,639
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to give this away to a random listener in part B. If you want to win this, you have to be in our chat room and

599
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:47,860
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

600
00:42:06,978 --> 00:42:07,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's it.

601
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:10,699
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I'm forgetting something, but if I think of it, I'll come back to it later.

602
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:12,820
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's get started with tonight's news in the meantime.

603
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

604
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:23,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure this is going to come to a shock to a lot of people, but there's a rumor that Final Fantasy XIII Versus is dead.

605
00:42:24,343 --> 00:42:24,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

606
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:32,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Shocking that, you know, a game that we haven't seen much of for six years not coming out.

607
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:54,960
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh yeah and this is coming from some inside sources um that apparently Kotaku is talking to and they're saying that you know it's officially canceled but I mean I don't know if it's officially canceled or if it's just gonna be retitled they haven't made a statement right there's no been no PR bulletin or anything okay

608
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:57,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's the last thing I think.

609
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:05,043
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost done with preparing our latest info for the game because of a totally unrelated reason.

610
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,327
[SPEAKER_02]: There are circumstances in which that info cannot be released.

611
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:27,754
[SPEAKER_02]: so info for that game maybe it's now no longer versus because honestly 13 versus it still didn't make any sense to me why it's called that because both games you know it looks nothing like Final Fantasy 13 at all and there's nothing so far that they've shown us that's led me to believe that's even in the same universe as 13

612
00:43:28,334 --> 00:43:30,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I think some of the mythology is supposed to be the same.

613
00:43:30,716 --> 00:43:35,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the whole LaCie and the Falsie and all that I think is supposed to be like a constant.

614
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was a trilogy but there was the main story and then the two guidance side stories.

615
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:41,867
[SPEAKER_06]: One for the PSP and then Versus 13.

616
00:43:42,147 --> 00:43:46,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's supposed to be some common thread no matter regardless of how thin tying it all together.

617
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:56,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy Agito, or whatever it was called, excuse me if I'm butchering that name, it just became Final Fantasy Type-0, so why wouldn't Final Fantasy XIII Versus just become something else?

618
00:43:56,695 --> 00:44:04,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Which folks are speculating, including me on this show a couple months ago, I think I said, why don't they just make it Final Fantasy XV at this point?

619
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:14,862
[SPEAKER_10]: It would make a lot of sense, because we're starting to get into the next cycle of consoles, yet we're supposed to get, I mean, you know, again, Square can do whatever they want, but historically there has always been

620
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Three Final Fantasy games on every console.

621
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:18,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about it.

622
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,489
[SPEAKER_10]: 1 through 3 was on the NES, even though 2 and 3 didn't come out here in America.

623
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,875
[SPEAKER_10]: 4, 5, and 6 was on the Super Nintendo, even though 5 didn't come out in North America, but it did later.

624
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:27,956
[SPEAKER_10]: 7, 8, and 9, PlayStation 1.

625
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:28,516
[SPEAKER_10]: 10, 11, 12, PlayStation 2.

626
00:44:28,556 --> 00:44:28,516
13, 14...

627
00:44:34,700 --> 00:45:02,287
[SPEAKER_02]: 13.2 13.2, yeah and technically 14 isn't out on consoles yet, although it's still slated it'll eventually come out, I mean 14 or we should say 11.2 because it's basically the 11 characters with their names changed so they could very well, instead of saying Falsie and Lussie or whatever, they could be like they're the we're just going to go back to Espers they're Espers now, or they're Summons, or they're I don't know

628
00:45:02,987 --> 00:45:04,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make up another name for summons.

629
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:07,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they could just... It's Final Fantasy blank.

630
00:45:07,311 --> 00:45:08,492
[SPEAKER_10]: They could think of a name for it.

631
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:10,274
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just like there was Final Fantasy Tactics.

632
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:12,796
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't really a Final Fantasy game, but kind of in that universe.

633
00:45:12,816 --> 00:45:13,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Dui Decium.

634
00:45:13,557 --> 00:45:13,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great game.

635
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:15,258
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck was that kind of a name?

636
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:16,159
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

637
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:26,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't count 13-2 really as a game in the... I mean, because then you'd have to count 10-2, and then you'd have to count Dirge of Cerberus, and it throws everything off.

638
00:45:26,228 --> 00:45:27,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you can't do that.

639
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:28,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

640
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:30,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all spin-offs.

641
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:34,113
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess we're going to have a definitive answer come, what, September 1st?

642
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:37,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's supposed to be some... Probably a Tokyo Game Show, at least by then.

643
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:39,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Square's doing some type of Final Fantasy.

644
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:45,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they even said, what is next in the Final Fantasy XIII universe on September 1st?

645
00:45:45,778 --> 00:45:52,061
[SPEAKER_10]: And so either that's Versus has a new name or it's...

646
00:45:52,978 --> 00:45:56,623
[SPEAKER_10]: or all of this is proven false because, again, it is a rumor.

647
00:45:57,464 --> 00:46:01,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, it's not like everything Kotaku's ever said has turned out to be true.

648
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about it.

649
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:09,099
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also a possibility, and a lot of people are saying, well, what else could they do but Final Fantasy XIII 3?

650
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:13,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't that be something?

651
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:23,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is weird because... If it's true that there's a Final Fantasy XIII 3, which would make a lot of sense.

652
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:24,976
[SPEAKER_10]: I think XIII 2 did pretty good.

653
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:28,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably wasn't as expensive to make because they made it on the same engine.

654
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:31,701
[SPEAKER_10]: They had all that DLC for it, which I'm sure made them money too.

655
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,924
[SPEAKER_10]: XIII 3 actually makes a lot of sense for them to do.

656
00:46:35,284 --> 00:46:36,605
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's weird because...

657
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:53,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy XIII was supposed to be three separate games and now Final Fantasy XIII might if these theories prove to end up being three games that are all just 1, 2, 3 Final Fantasy XIII, 1, 2, 3 It's kind of weird how it transformed like that

658
00:46:58,145 --> 00:47:14,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the reason why a lot of people are invested in this story is for those who don't follow Square Enix that closely, the crew that, like the director and the main crew who did the Kingdom Hearts console games have been working on 13 versus 13 for however, five, six years.

659
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So for it to become vaporware maybe would piss a lot of people off because...

660
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:37,342
[SPEAKER_10]: depending on how tinfoil hat you want to get the Kingdom Hearts console team has been working on it so they need to have a product out so they can work on the next Kingdom Hearts I just can't see Square just throwing it away I could see where Square has decided Kingdom Hearts 3 needs to happen now

661
00:47:37,862 --> 00:47:40,543
[SPEAKER_10]: and so maybe they've said, you know what guys?

662
00:47:40,863 --> 00:47:49,948
[SPEAKER_10]: You've had this game for too effing long so we're taking it away from you and giving it to this other team and we're going to put it out under a new name and you guys go work on Kingdom Hearts 3.

663
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:52,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, anything is possible in that regard.

664
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:54,750
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

665
00:48:13,686 --> 00:48:14,567
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not beyond throwing.

666
00:48:15,027 --> 00:48:19,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Although some things that they should really throw out, 14, they just don't and they hold on to.

667
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the other thing.

668
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:27,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they're realizing they need to rush 15 because they need to erase 14, basically.

669
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is still getting relaunched.

670
00:48:29,477 --> 00:48:46,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I also saw speculation that the reason why there's no press release saying yes versus 13, this is what's happened to it, whether it be canceled or whatever, is because their last year fiscally was so bad because of 14 shedding the bed that they're just not putting out negative press releases anymore because of damage control from 14.

671
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,511
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's kind of, I don't...

672
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,691
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a thought.

673
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:53,374
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to drag this out too long, much longer.

674
00:48:53,394 --> 00:49:08,690
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to get to the next story, but I do want to kind of throw this idea out there because somebody on Facebook had said this and I was like, hmm, that's a good point, is that, well, if they canceled Final Fantasy XIII Versus, why did they just release the theme song for Theatrhythm?

675
00:49:09,651 --> 00:49:12,613
[SPEAKER_10]: because Theatrhythm has that song as a downloadable song.

676
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:19,217
[SPEAKER_10]: So why would they release that if they just canceled the game and teased this Final Fantasy XIII versus?

677
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, this could be the case of Square Enix being a giant company.

678
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:29,543
[SPEAKER_10]: The left hand hasn't told the right hand Theatrhythm DLC team what's going on, but I thought it was an interesting point.

679
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:32,044
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

680
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:35,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to another story.

681
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:36,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Avatar Famestars

682
00:49:51,242 --> 00:50:03,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, a trademark for the game had turned up earlier in the year, but now we're starting to see this actually appear in games, such as Wreck-A-Tier, not to be confused with the game that's on Steam.

683
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,528
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Wreck, like Wreck-It Ralph, Wreck-A-Tier.

684
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:13,930
[SPEAKER_10]: It is part of Microsoft's Summer of Arcade series, and it is including this Avatar Famestars.

685
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:14,691
[SPEAKER_10]: What is this?

686
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:15,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Quote,

687
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:28,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Avatar Fame Stars is a new program from Microsoft Studios and is part of a select group of games that delivers new and exciting ways to play online with your friends and compete for social recognition, according to Microsoft.

688
00:50:29,521 --> 00:50:40,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess this is supposed to include in-game challenges, and this sounds like kind of like rebranding of shit that's already been there, because if you do these challenges...

689
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,471
[SPEAKER_10]: or I thought Achievements.

690
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:48,615
[SPEAKER_10]: In these Avatar Fame Star games, you get rewards based on your Fame Star points.

691
00:50:49,175 --> 00:50:50,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, so like rewards for my Avatar.

692
00:50:50,956 --> 00:50:53,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't that technology already exist on the 360?

693
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:57,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I could swear that if you play like Super Meat Boy, you get a T-shirt.

694
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Minecraft.

695
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:00,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's tons of that type of stuff in games.

696
00:51:01,102 --> 00:51:02,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm trying to figure out like what is this?

697
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:09,409
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess what they're doing is instead of it being game by game by game, this is one gigantic pool.

698
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:18,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So if a game is participating in this pool, then you get the points and the achievement points towards a common unlock.

699
00:51:18,998 --> 00:51:22,381
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the difference, which is a little weird, but that's how it works.

700
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:27,746
[SPEAKER_10]: So the rewards cross from game to game, as does the points total.

701
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:31,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Avatar Famestars is locked to your Xbox 360.

702
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:38,872
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saying it's possible this is something that could spill over to Windows 8, Surface tablets, Windows phones.

703
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:39,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

704
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:47,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Other games that will include Avatar Famestars support, Full House Poker, World of Kieflings, so games that already exist.

705
00:51:47,397 --> 00:51:48,778
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be kind of patched in.

706
00:51:49,218 --> 00:51:53,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Fire Pro Wrestling, Home Run Stars, Avatar Motocross Madness.

707
00:51:54,321 --> 00:52:03,797
[SPEAKER_10]: we don't know when the already existing games will have it patched in or when all these other games are coming out but I guess if you're into collecting avatar awards there you go

708
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:32,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about you guys, but pretty much every avatar on my friends list is all wearing Mass Effect carb Not me though, I actually tried to make my avatar look like me I was a sucker and I spent like 120 Microsoft points to get a stupid hat for my avatar that looks like a hat I would wear out to a club Because I am a sucker Anyhow, let's move on with some more news

709
00:52:34,201 --> 00:52:38,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So Valve is always trying to do great and interesting things with Steam.

710
00:52:38,684 --> 00:52:41,847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gaming store and application.

711
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:51,894
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought Steam to Mac and Apple platforms, and they also invented Steam Play, which is where if you buy a license for one game on PC, you get it for Mac and vice versa.

712
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:53,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they're bringing Steam to Linux.

713
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:56,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's going to be a Steam client.

714
00:52:56,738 --> 00:53:02,841
[SPEAKER_06]: For Linux, they are using the Ubuntu distribution.

715
00:53:02,921 --> 00:53:11,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And for people who aren't familiar with Linux, there's different revisions of it based on which company wrote that build of it.

716
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:14,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's Red Hat and Corel and Ubuntu.

717
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:21,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's what they're going for because it's sort of the popular make of it right now.

718
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:32,255
[SPEAKER_06]: The first game that they're porting to their first party title that they're bringing to Steam Linux is Left 4 Dead 2.

719
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:34,897
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been working on it since last year, 2011.

720
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be an internal beta of Steam on Ubuntu in the near future.

721
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:43,616
[SPEAKER_06]: They've announced that it is coming soon.

722
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Left 4 Dead 2 is the first title they're bringing to it.

723
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:54,540
[SPEAKER_06]: If other developers want to port their games over to Linux, Valve is making the distribution model for it.

724
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You ran a Linux box for a while, didn't you?

725
00:53:57,641 --> 00:53:58,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of, yeah.

726
00:53:58,321 --> 00:53:59,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a FreeBSD box.

727
00:54:00,462 --> 00:54:04,584
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a long time ago, back when I was trying to host my own domain name and be a super nerd.

728
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:06,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask this question.

729
00:54:06,515 --> 00:54:08,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to take it back a huge step here.

730
00:54:08,517 --> 00:54:12,001
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to ask this question because I seriously think a lot of people don't know the answer to this.

731
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:19,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think sometimes the hardcore computer people, super nerds, don't realize that a lot of people don't get this.

732
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:20,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe they do.

733
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:20,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

734
00:54:21,129 --> 00:54:25,013
[SPEAKER_10]: But why would someone want to have a Linux machine?

735
00:54:25,353 --> 00:54:27,674
[SPEAKER_10]: What does Linux do for you that Windows doesn't?

736
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:28,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Uptime.

737
00:54:29,355 --> 00:54:32,336
[SPEAKER_06]: A well-made Linux install.

738
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,417
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have your computer on all the time.

739
00:54:35,697 --> 00:54:36,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't lose any performance.

740
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:54,525
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put... The terminology, I haven't touched this stuff in seriously like 10 years, but when people think Linux or Unix, they think of sort of like MS-DOS prompt, like just a text terminal, but that's not the case.

741
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Linux has visual Windows-ish interfaces now.

742
00:55:00,653 --> 00:55:09,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but if you're into independent software, like really independent, Linux has got a huge community, people making apps for each other.

743
00:55:09,485 --> 00:55:09,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

744
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:10,867
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all about the...

745
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:24,577
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do have a good internet connection, you want to host your own email, host your own domain names, host your own web server, blah, blah, blah, you're going to be running some flavor of Linux on that box if you want to do all that in-house.

746
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:28,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at all these nerds in our chat room, and I say that lovingly.

747
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:32,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackwolf says, I've had a free BSD server up for over 1,000 days.

748
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:35,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Up time.

749
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:35,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Up time.

750
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,404
[SPEAKER_10]: My home box was up for 400 days until I rebooted it recently.

751
00:55:40,084 --> 00:55:44,188
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw says Linux is commonly used to run servers, especially for online games.

752
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,851
[SPEAKER_10]: GameGuru says Linux is generally more secure than Windows.

753
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that, though, because just less people use it?

754
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:57,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it's kind of like the whole, well, Apple never gets hacked because there's less people on, you know, those systems than there are on...

755
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:06,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was a problem in the early 2000s where certain distributions of Linux, if you just put it on a machine, would have its email relay turned on by default.

756
00:56:06,985 --> 00:56:12,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So if someone found your IP address, they could just spam the shit out of everybody using your server and you would never know.

757
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:19,351
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't know what you're doing, people can do nasty things on your Linux box.

758
00:56:19,451 --> 00:56:20,912
[SPEAKER_06]: But then that's your problem.

759
00:56:20,932 --> 00:56:24,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you being an idiot, not the software being, you know, built...

760
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:27,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Technus says, I like Linux.

761
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:29,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate the elitist community that comes with it.

762
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:31,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

763
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:40,282
[SPEAKER_06]: FreeBSD versus Linux, or just the StarBSD versus StarLinux, that's some Star Wars, Star Trek shit.

764
00:56:40,382 --> 00:56:44,244
[SPEAKER_06]: There's switchblades, and people get shivved in alleyways.

765
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:45,305
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very brutal.

766
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,272
[SPEAKER_10]: So Steam on Linux, do you think that would be well received by the community?

767
00:56:50,512 --> 00:56:52,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do you think it'll be like, ugh, commercialism?

768
00:56:52,854 --> 00:57:04,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they would have to run, if they really wanted to play Windows games on Linux, they would have to do, I think, it's called Wine, which is kind of like, I think, Boot Camp.

769
00:57:04,942 --> 00:57:07,324
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people on the internet wine very well.

770
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

771
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:31,877
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like boot camper parallels I think on Mac where you can run Windows through it so if people wanted to play PC games but they just I don't want a PC box in my house I don't want a partition of a hard drive god damn it this will allow them to do that for at least for Left 4 Dead 2 anything else if they don't want to have a Windows box or a Windows partition they're going to have to mess with it

772
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:36,628
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf says very clearly, Wine is not an emulator.

773
00:57:36,788 --> 00:57:39,328
[SPEAKER_10]: It basically implements the Windows DLLs on Linux.

774
00:57:40,609 --> 00:57:42,129
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little correction.

775
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:44,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Because remember, Linux, elitist.

776
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:45,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Bobby?

777
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:46,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm giving him a hard time.

778
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,931
[SPEAKER_10]: GameGuru says Left 4 Dead 2 is a good choice.

779
00:57:50,991 --> 00:57:52,391
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a rather complex source game.

780
00:57:52,591 --> 00:57:52,951
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

781
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:55,892
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can get that on there, then that opens the door to a lot of other games.

782
00:57:56,292 --> 00:58:03,519
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, before we go on to the next story, Loki, I want to... Wine actually stands for wine is not an emulator.

783
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I actually knew that, but I'm so far removed.

784
00:58:06,062 --> 00:58:07,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten years, just saying old age.

785
00:58:07,724 --> 00:58:07,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

786
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:08,384
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

787
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:14,611
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go back to a comment that came up in chat earlier, because this is a very important clarification to something I brought up a minute ago.

788
00:58:15,331 --> 00:58:43,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Osfer in our chatroom says for the Theatrhythm DLC for Somnus from Final Fantasy Versus XIII it labels the song as just from the Final Fantasy series but not which one maybe that's a sign of the name change that they don't want to reveal yet that is huge that is a big deal I think that's worth stating so thank you for saying that Osfer I think that is if they didn't label it as Versus XIII then yes a name change is coming or question mark question mark

789
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:45,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.

790
00:58:46,254 --> 00:58:46,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

791
00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:48,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, back to news.

792
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:48,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Loki.

793
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:54,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Fez.

794
00:58:54,697 --> 00:59:06,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Fez had an issue with one of its recent patches where not a lot of people, but some people were having issues with their save games being obliterated.

795
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:19,513
[SPEAKER_02]: and, of course, because of that, Polytron pulled back the patch that they put out and they were going to release a second patch to fix that problem.

796
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:28,162
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they said no because it was going to cost them $10,000 to get the game recertified by Microsoft.

797
00:59:29,223 --> 00:59:41,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so they're just saying, well, you know, if any players have an issue with the game, um, you know, your saves being deleted since you're only like 1%, um, kind of tough luck.

798
00:59:41,593 --> 00:59:42,794
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to deal with it.

799
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:52,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so of course, you know, they made the comment, you know, had Fez been released on Steam, we wouldn't have this issue because updates are free.

800
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:57,813
[SPEAKER_10]: But I believe the designer of Fez said it's not a PC game.

801
00:59:58,514 --> 00:59:59,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't want it on PCs.

802
01:00:00,275 --> 01:00:00,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

803
01:00:02,156 --> 01:00:03,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they said no.

804
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, does that mean a Steam version is in progress?

805
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:11,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a few months left for Xbox Live Arcade exclusivity, they said.

806
01:00:12,104 --> 01:00:21,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, of course, responded saying that Polytron and their investors, Trapdoor, made the decision not to work on an additional title update for Fez.

807
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:31,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft Studios chose to support this decision based on the belief that Polytron and Trapdoor were in the best position to determine what the acceptable quality level for their game is.

808
01:00:32,953 --> 01:00:41,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we do not disclose the cost of title updates, we did offer to work with Trapdoor and make sure that wasn't a blocking issue.

809
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:44,383
[SPEAKER_02]: We were mainly huge fans of Fez.

810
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:50,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know if that means, okay, we're not going to charge you $10,000, but we'll charge you $7,500.

811
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Discount!

812
01:00:53,611 --> 01:00:54,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Discount.

813
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't really know what the issue is.

814
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:58,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently Microsoft patches are available in the Steam sale.

815
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:01,580
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's my thing.

816
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:08,203
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, it is a closed system, so Microsoft can charge you wherever the hell you want.

817
01:01:08,483 --> 01:01:12,885
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you make your game, you're well aware of what those costs are going to be before you make your game.

818
01:01:13,486 --> 01:01:15,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably thought, okay, well, that's no problem.

819
01:01:15,267 --> 01:01:17,228
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to have an issue with this stuff.

820
01:01:17,248 --> 01:01:22,130
[SPEAKER_02]: But then some bugs went through, and so they released a patch, which obviously they did not test well enough.

821
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:28,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's only happening to 1% of the people all the time... See, I don't understand how a save game problem can only be happening to 1% of the people because...

822
01:01:29,834 --> 01:01:54,135
[SPEAKER_02]: that's you're basically running on systems that are all the same you know I don't understand how it can affect one and not the other but whatever so they released a patch that they didn't test well enough and now they're complaining that they would have to pay more money out of their pocket to you know fix the game and I understand this developer is not as big as like Activision who releases like 13 goddamn patches for Call of Duty and

823
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:57,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Indie Game, The Movie, Surely They Must Be Rich

824
01:02:06,934 --> 01:02:11,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if that's the case, but maybe $10,000 is too much.

825
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:13,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're kind of like opportunity costs.

826
01:02:13,215 --> 01:02:24,218
[SPEAKER_02]: We can either fix it for the 1%, but are we really going to recoup this money in additional sales, or do we just leave it as it is, and hopefully it doesn't affect that many more people, and we'll just keep the money where we're at.

827
01:02:24,258 --> 01:02:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of where they're at, is that they want to spend the money.

828
01:02:27,218 --> 01:02:36,140
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a tricky issue, though, because on one hand, I'm like, wow, that's kind of fucked up of Microsoft to charge so much money, but on the other hand, I'm like, well, it also really encourages people to get it right the first time, so I can't blame them.

829
01:02:36,440 --> 01:03:05,281
[SPEAKER_02]: because as it is games are patched left and right anyways and you know I think that it's a good thing that they do charge that kind of money because it does discourage them from like going well fuck it we didn't really test this game so we're just gonna release it out there we'll see what kind of bugs people run into and then we'll go fix it I should be able to get a refund when their game is buggy as hell although it's not granted it's only affecting less than one or whatever it is one percent of people but if I'm in that one percent I should be able to get my money back don't you think

830
01:03:07,526 --> 01:03:17,987
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd have to make the argument with Microsoft Welcome to the world of digital distribution Yeah They just take customer service right on out of the picture

831
01:03:18,602 --> 01:03:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, it's not necessarily Microsoft's fault that that game doesn't work.

832
01:03:25,446 --> 01:03:26,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just being hosted on their service.

833
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:31,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the developer and publisher that decided, hey, we don't want to pay money to fix this game.

834
01:03:31,209 --> 01:03:33,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to go ask them for your money back.

835
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's on their system.

836
01:03:35,871 --> 01:03:37,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only on their system.

837
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:39,874
[SPEAKER_10]: They kind of own it a little bit too.

838
01:03:39,994 --> 01:03:40,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, whether they want it or not.

839
01:03:40,994 --> 01:03:41,895
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not their fault though.

840
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:42,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

841
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like saying, oh, that game is like –

842
01:03:48,398 --> 01:03:55,142
[SPEAKER_02]: This game is buggy, and just because it happens to be on Xbox 360, I'm going to blame Microsoft for it.

843
01:03:55,682 --> 01:03:58,884
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense, because they're just providing the system that it runs on.

844
01:03:58,944 --> 01:04:00,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Their system's not causing the problem.

845
01:04:01,826 --> 01:04:03,047
[SPEAKER_02]: At least, I don't think it is.

846
01:04:04,153 --> 01:04:19,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well let's move on to a different topic that apparently is causing a big problem in the iPad world, or iOS, but this particularly is for the iPad, and Alan, I'm pretty happy that Maruko in San Rio, your cats...

847
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,480
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

848
01:04:39,716 --> 01:04:44,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm incredibly against decline cats because they actually remove like it's part of the bone.

849
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:45,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

850
01:04:45,657 --> 01:04:47,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're taking off like half their finger.

851
01:04:47,178 --> 01:04:48,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's wrong.

852
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:52,819
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you don't have a declawed cat, why is it pining your iPad?

853
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:54,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It costs like $800.

854
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:55,640
[SPEAKER_06]: What is wrong with you?

855
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the glass scratches that easy from cats scratching it.

856
01:04:58,641 --> 01:05:03,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like my cat scratches our LCD TV and... I wouldn't want to take that chance.

857
01:05:04,002 --> 01:05:06,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I look at the sofa and I'm like... Well, that's the sofa.

858
01:05:06,845 --> 01:05:11,089
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you've got material where the cat's claws are getting caught in.

859
01:05:11,369 --> 01:05:12,891
[SPEAKER_10]: The cats have already fucked up the bed.

860
01:05:12,911 --> 01:05:14,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we're talking glass.

861
01:05:14,472 --> 01:05:18,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking glass that's meant to withstand quite a few scuffs.

862
01:05:19,517 --> 01:05:28,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, dropping it on something or scraping it against something sharp might cause a scratch, but the cat claws aren't strong enough to cause a lot of scratches.

863
01:05:28,646 --> 01:05:33,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's folks in the chat saying Bobby Blackwolf says their claws don't scratch the screen.

864
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:34,068
[SPEAKER_10]: They've tested.

865
01:05:34,088 --> 01:05:35,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus, I hear that.

866
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't believe it.

867
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:39,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, the bottom of their feet are nice and soft.

868
01:05:39,751 --> 01:05:42,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever scratches they put in there, they buff right out.

869
01:05:42,992 --> 01:05:44,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fine.

870
01:05:44,372 --> 01:05:48,094
[SPEAKER_06]: When a cat bats at something playfully, it doesn't have its claws out.

871
01:05:48,114 --> 01:05:54,377
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it's trying to fuck up a chair, it's trying to clean its claws on it.

872
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:55,457
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, its claws are out.

873
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:57,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not going to do that on an iPad.

874
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,603
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

875
01:06:16,154 --> 01:06:20,337
[SPEAKER_10]: It, like everything else in the Apple world these days, has DLC.

876
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:22,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Double dippin', right?

877
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Charge you up front and then, hey, you want more levels for your cats?

878
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,564
[SPEAKER_10]: 99 cents for a new mouse level.

879
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:29,684
[SPEAKER_10]: What a surprise.

880
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:31,506
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the real surprise.

881
01:06:33,507 --> 01:06:34,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Cats bought it.

882
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:41,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there's this epidemic where cats are inadvertently buying the DLC.

883
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And people are complaining...

884
01:06:45,578 --> 01:06:50,382
[SPEAKER_09]: That the design of the game fooled cats into buying it on purpose.

885
01:06:51,483 --> 01:06:55,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because there's probably some little mouse that says buy more on it that runs across the screen.

886
01:06:56,587 --> 01:06:59,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the next one is yes to check out.

887
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

888
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:04,674
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, real hard stuff to code around.

889
01:07:04,694 --> 01:07:10,039
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I thought that they had to put in passwords in order to, you know, get that stuff purchased.

890
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,461
[SPEAKER_02]: You can save those, apparently.

891
01:07:12,121 --> 01:07:13,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't do that on my iPod.

892
01:07:14,023 --> 01:07:14,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to, you know.

893
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:17,186
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can save your password so it never prompts you for that stuff.

894
01:07:17,486 --> 01:07:17,887
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

895
01:07:32,523 --> 01:07:34,444
[SPEAKER_09]: We let our cats watch the TV.

896
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:37,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is it stupid?

897
01:07:37,245 --> 01:07:40,426
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, okay, this is basically like saying, hey, you know what?

898
01:07:40,466 --> 01:07:41,546
[SPEAKER_02]: My cat likes the outdoors.

899
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:45,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy it a car so it can drive down the street because it fucking likes the outdoors.

900
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Tootsies is real.

901
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:57,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that I can see someone having a little swipe, you know, a little game visually for the cat on an iPad.

902
01:07:57,151 --> 01:07:57,712
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

903
01:07:57,792 --> 01:07:58,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I can believe that.

904
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:00,993
[SPEAKER_06]: What I can't believe is someone going, hmm...

905
01:08:02,473 --> 01:08:06,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Mittens was really into that game a week ago, but now she just doesn't care.

906
01:08:06,137 --> 01:08:07,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she needs the DLC.

907
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:12,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she needs a new stage for her to be interested in again.

908
01:08:12,183 --> 01:08:14,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, cats don't give a shit.

909
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:16,978
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com

910
01:08:39,435 --> 01:08:41,016
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, I gotta get that light.

911
01:08:41,096 --> 01:08:41,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta get the light.

912
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:42,877
[SPEAKER_02]: The light's delicious.

913
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:43,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Eat the light.

914
01:08:43,558 --> 01:08:43,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.

915
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:44,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Light.

916
01:08:44,599 --> 01:08:45,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Chase the light.

917
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:46,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.

918
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna get it.

919
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:48,221
[SPEAKER_02]: The light.

920
01:08:48,581 --> 01:08:48,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.

921
01:08:49,502 --> 01:08:49,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.

922
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:50,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.

923
01:08:50,242 --> 01:08:50,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, damn it.

924
01:08:50,643 --> 01:08:51,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my paw.

925
01:08:51,563 --> 01:08:51,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

926
01:08:51,923 --> 01:08:52,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so close.

927
01:08:53,384 --> 01:08:53,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

928
01:08:54,165 --> 01:08:54,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.

929
01:08:54,485 --> 01:08:54,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Light.

930
01:08:54,705 --> 01:08:55,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd it go?

931
01:08:55,106 --> 01:08:55,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd it go?

932
01:08:55,486 --> 01:08:55,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd it go?

933
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:56,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd it go?

934
01:08:56,146 --> 01:08:56,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Where'd it go?

935
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:59,330
[SPEAKER_02]: That can also be a dog too, by the way.

936
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:00,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Dogs do that.

937
01:09:01,733 --> 01:09:07,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to love that because I'd play with the laser pointer on my dog and you'd see her just like twitching out for like an hour afterwards.

938
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:10,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, what, what, what, what, what?

939
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:11,747
[SPEAKER_10]: They're coming for me.

940
01:09:11,767 --> 01:09:12,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, wait.

941
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:19,850
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer the folks in chat, Hiccup is the company behind this game.

942
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:28,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And an artist named TJ Fuller, who did the artwork in Games for Cats, said, quote, We got in a lot of trouble.

943
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:38,085
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they have implemented a human check to fix the issue.

944
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:44,510
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to hold four fingers on touch points without moving them for a few seconds.

945
01:09:45,131 --> 01:09:50,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Because a cat would never have that type of attention span to hold in four spots for a few seconds.

946
01:09:50,635 --> 01:09:55,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's standing on top of the iPad.

947
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:55,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

948
01:09:58,095 --> 01:10:04,297
[SPEAKER_10]: So just like you have to monitor your children when they're playing with the iPad, maybe you should monitor your cat.

949
01:10:04,977 --> 01:10:11,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Because let's be real, you're not buying the app on the iPad for the cat's enjoyment, you're buying it for yours to watch the cat play it.

950
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:15,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Get the cat away from you so they would stop bothering you.

951
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:23,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma in chat says, this all reminds me of the Smurfs village fiasco.

952
01:10:23,908 --> 01:10:25,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Ranma, but those were children.

953
01:10:25,469 --> 01:10:26,269
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a cat.

954
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter.

955
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,730
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have like 13-year-olds.

956
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that those Microsoft purchases were real money.

957
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:33,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

958
01:10:33,753 --> 01:10:34,553
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't know that.

959
01:10:35,614 --> 01:10:36,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

960
01:10:38,455 --> 01:10:39,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now you know.

961
01:10:41,985 --> 01:10:49,468
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name of the really, he's really old, he's got the sunglasses, the fashion designer, Margaret Cho had a bit about him.

962
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:51,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Carl Lagerfeld.

963
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:51,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

964
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:56,291
[SPEAKER_06]: His cat has a personal assistant and a Twitter and its own iPad.

965
01:10:56,812 --> 01:10:57,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just put that out there.

966
01:10:58,252 --> 01:11:00,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Carl Lagerfeld's cat has its own iPad.

967
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:02,734
[SPEAKER_06]: So that maybe that could be, you know.

968
01:11:02,914 --> 01:11:04,155
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you done with your life?

969
01:11:04,175 --> 01:11:04,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

970
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So the story reminded me of that.

971
01:11:11,881 --> 01:11:12,862
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a real thing.

972
01:11:13,522 --> 01:11:15,343
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you put on your resume?

973
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was a personal assistant to this cat.

974
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:24,190
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my last... The cat fired me because I... Tunes is the driving cat.

975
01:11:24,611 --> 01:11:26,712
[SPEAKER_00]: The cat who can drive a car.

976
01:11:27,773 --> 01:11:30,916
[SPEAKER_00]: He drives around all over the town.

977
01:11:31,056 --> 01:11:32,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Tunes is the driving cat.

978
01:11:34,318 --> 01:11:37,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Tunes is the cat who can drive a car.

979
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:38,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just look at me!

980
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be real, though.

981
01:11:46,088 --> 01:11:49,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Two Exes did a good thing by making sure Victoria Jackson was in that car.

982
01:11:51,492 --> 01:11:51,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Agree.

983
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:53,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And poor Phil Hartman.

984
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:54,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Poor Phil Hartman.

985
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:55,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Rest in peace.

986
01:11:57,677 --> 01:12:04,763
[SPEAKER_10]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VOGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, kitten.

987
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:07,405
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's move on.

988
01:12:07,586 --> 01:12:07,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan.

989
01:12:11,171 --> 01:12:12,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, I'm eating popcorn.

990
01:12:14,912 --> 01:12:15,493
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?

991
01:12:15,653 --> 01:12:22,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony is shutting down the online servers for two of its MotorStorm Muddy Truck games.

992
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:25,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, it's MotorStorm Pacific Rift.

993
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:41,833
[SPEAKER_06]: which came out in 2008 so that is four years old and it's PSP counterpart MotorStorm Arctic Edge so if you like to connect to PSN and do races co-op or whatever with the matching service that is all going away.

994
01:12:43,001 --> 01:12:46,482
[SPEAKER_06]: as of, I think, October 1st is the last day.

995
01:12:47,043 --> 01:12:50,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I guess September 30th is the last day you have to enjoy that because October 1st is going down.

996
01:12:50,664 --> 01:12:51,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least I gave you a heads up.

997
01:12:52,104 --> 01:12:53,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that was nice then.

998
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:56,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Are any of these games online pass games or are we not there yet?

999
01:12:56,386 --> 01:12:57,186
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're not yet.

1000
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:58,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even get into it.

1001
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:04,169
[SPEAKER_10]: When I was bitching about Mass Effect 3, by the way, I didn't even get into the online pass thing and how my $10 isn't paying for shit.

1002
01:13:04,209 --> 01:13:08,010
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, I'll just let that argument write itself, boys and girls.

1003
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:09,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to throw that out there.

1004
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a really short story.

1005
01:13:13,733 --> 01:13:14,634
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really it.

1006
01:13:15,055 --> 01:13:22,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Motorstorm Pacific Rift and Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is a PSP title, losing its Sony-provided network.

1007
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:25,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the PSPs are molding over anyway, so that one's not so bad, you know.

1008
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:33,490
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what games we can buy that will have their servers shut down in 2015.

1009
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:42,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if any of these games are going to have their servers shut down, but there is not really much coming out this week because it's kind of falling along the lines of...

1010
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,881
[SPEAKER_02]: July, the month with no game releases.

1011
01:13:47,161 --> 01:14:06,728
[SPEAKER_02]: But this week we do have, if you're feeling that you've got to get in shape to wear a bikini, maybe not this year because you've procrastinated too long, but for next year, they've got the Adidas MyCoach for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Move and Connect.

1012
01:14:06,748 --> 01:14:08,749
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of pre-orders for that.

1013
01:14:09,369 --> 01:14:10,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming out this week.

1014
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:11,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Myst on 3DS.

1015
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:18,515
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's actually people that were born well after that game came out.

1016
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:23,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And Prototype 2 on PC finally making its way out.

1017
01:14:24,702 --> 01:14:26,183
[SPEAKER_02]: That was quite delayed.

1018
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:35,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also I guess they have a Move Essential bundle for the PlayStation 3 with Just Dance 3 thrown in there.

1019
01:14:38,044 --> 01:14:39,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so that's it.

1020
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,496
[SPEAKER_10]: But that is out in Japan this week on July the 26th.

1021
01:15:03,976 --> 01:15:08,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Alice Madness Returns gets a price reduction on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1022
01:15:08,677 --> 01:15:13,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Multirade 2 HD version.

1023
01:15:14,198 --> 01:15:16,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So that tells me this is a remake HD version.

1024
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:20,140
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a remake of a title that was already out there.

1025
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:23,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to see if this is a game I recognize from here.

1026
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:24,621
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like...

1027
01:15:26,201 --> 01:15:26,641
[SPEAKER_10]: DYNASTY WARRIORS

1028
01:15:50,624 --> 01:15:52,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing really of note on the Vita this week.

1029
01:15:53,106 --> 01:15:56,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Some accessories, a new AC adapter, but that's not that exciting.

1030
01:15:56,689 --> 01:16:05,277
[SPEAKER_10]: So lastly on the 3DS this week, Cave Story 3D makes its way to Japan this week, as does a new pen in cobalt blue.

1031
01:16:05,557 --> 01:16:06,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, ah.

1032
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,600
[SPEAKER_10]: That does it for Japanese releases.

1033
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, UK.

1034
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:11,763
[SPEAKER_06]: UK and Europe.

1035
01:16:12,144 --> 01:16:15,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Prototype 2 on PC is coming out July 24th.

1036
01:16:15,768 --> 01:16:23,437
[SPEAKER_06]: July 25th, we have Wizorb, which I would recommend very much if you're into 16-bit retro sort of games.

1037
01:16:23,477 --> 01:16:27,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 2D, but it's an RPG, Arkanoid Breakout mashup game.

1038
01:16:27,942 --> 01:16:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's got the Super NES graphics, and you're a little wizard.

1039
01:16:30,925 --> 01:16:32,566
[SPEAKER_06]: playing Breakout, and it's really fun.

1040
01:16:32,827 --> 01:16:33,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I have that on Steam.

1041
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:33,868
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cute.

1042
01:16:33,948 --> 01:16:39,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's also, check out the Steam sale before it goes away because I got it a couple days ago for like three bucks.

1043
01:16:39,673 --> 01:16:42,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And on indie games for Xbox if you don't have that.

1044
01:16:43,156 --> 01:16:44,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.

1045
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:49,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's specifically on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PSP.

1046
01:16:49,941 --> 01:16:51,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Wizorb also on July 25th.

1047
01:16:52,203 --> 01:17:10,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Recketeer which is the game we were talking about earlier July 27th we have Inversion on PC and Pokemon Conquest on DS and then finally for this week on July 28th Freaky Forms Deluxe Your Creation's Alive which is a very silly name I don't know what that is

1048
01:17:11,892 --> 01:17:16,216
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get into the classic game of the week.

1049
01:17:16,296 --> 01:17:22,842
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura may not be here to give the classic game out, but SalaciousPop will fill in, and we'll figure out what he picked in just a minute.

1050
01:17:23,262 --> 01:17:24,003
[SPEAKER_10]: For now, Loki.

1051
01:17:24,764 --> 01:17:26,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of interesting.

1052
01:17:26,906 --> 01:17:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: You may remember a few years ago there was a class— I mean, there's always class-sashing lawsuits when it comes to Madden and NCAA, but there's one that actually went to court, and they finally settled, so—

1053
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:45,398
[SPEAKER_02]: EA has reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that started in 2008 for $27 million.

1054
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:56,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, part of that, they will not be able to renew their exclusive agreement with the NCAA, assuming that the court upholds that.

1055
01:17:57,324 --> 01:18:05,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, because of that, those who were affected by it, who purchased a

1056
01:18:06,784 --> 01:18:18,688
[SPEAKER_02]: EA Sports NCAA game will be entitled to anywhere from $6.79 per game on the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 and $1.95 for the Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3.

1057
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're saying that also EA has agreed to stipulation on future license agreements as part of the proposed settlement they will not make any exclusive licensing deals with the AFL for five years and they will not renew their current agreement with the NCAA and also they won't be able to enter another exclusive licensing agreement with the NCAA for five years and the exclusive I guess well the trademarks for like the NFL and stuff are not affected by it because this is only the NCAA

1058
01:18:53,753 --> 01:19:21,182
[SPEAKER_10]: but uh it's still interesting yeah I was gonna say I don't follow sports titles as closely you know I think that's pretty obvious if you listen to the show for a while but obviously these are huge money games I know EA's had a lot of they've taken a lot of shit for their exclusive agreements in the past this kind of seems like a big deal here I mean granted the the refunds that people get aren't that big a deal although I heard that whatever people don't claim will go to child's play which that's great but

1059
01:19:22,202 --> 01:19:22,542
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucks.

1060
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:22,782
[SPEAKER_10]: It sucks.

1061
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:51,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it sucked because it didn't have those licenses.

1062
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,753
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't have as big of a budget.

1063
01:19:53,873 --> 01:19:55,574
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sucked as just a game, though.

1064
01:19:56,274 --> 01:19:59,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say they couldn't pull something out, but I don't know.

1065
01:20:00,375 --> 01:20:08,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the other thing, too, is that they have to wait on approval from the court, which is going to happen on September 27th.

1066
01:20:08,357 --> 01:20:12,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is all, right now, the settlement, but the court has to say, okay, we agreed it.

1067
01:20:12,578 --> 01:20:13,538
[SPEAKER_02]: The settlement's fine.

1068
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:16,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just have to see what happens there.

1069
01:20:17,253 --> 01:20:36,526
[SPEAKER_02]: and we should say again the NFL trademark is not it's not affected no this does not affect Madden at all so um but I just think it's funny though is our arena football is also I mean they haven't had an arena football game in forever although I didn't remember they did try that for a while they had an arena football game for like two years what about the XFL game I'm just kidding

1070
01:20:39,602 --> 01:20:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lingerie Football League

1071
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, that's a real thing.

1072
01:20:58,717 --> 01:20:59,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I might play that.

1073
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:04,659
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.

1074
01:21:05,419 --> 01:21:08,660
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the problem with those lingerie football leagues and stuff like that?

1075
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:16,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the people watch you because they're hoping that a top gets ripped off, and it never fucking happens.

1076
01:21:17,203 --> 01:21:18,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my problem.

1077
01:21:18,564 --> 01:21:19,584
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not adult enough.

1078
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:21,745
[SPEAKER_02]: We need an adult...

1079
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:24,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I need an adult.

1080
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:31,935
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only so much plausible deniability on why you're watching it before it's like I could have looked at so much porn in the time that I've been watching this.

1081
01:21:32,196 --> 01:21:34,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to take it that next step further.

1082
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching this because I think they play really good football.

1083
01:21:38,374 --> 01:21:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's believing that.

1084
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:40,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're reading it for the articles.

1085
01:21:41,316 --> 01:21:41,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, of course.

1086
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:43,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching this for the articles.

1087
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:50,161
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what would make – getting away from sexy women for a minute, you know what they should license into a game?

1088
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:51,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Puppy Bowl.

1089
01:21:51,602 --> 01:21:51,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1090
01:21:52,102 --> 01:21:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: They've already done that because you see – Get out.

1091
01:21:54,063 --> 01:21:54,323
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1092
01:21:54,403 --> 01:21:55,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Puppy Bowl.

1093
01:21:55,384 --> 01:21:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, there was the – God, who was it?

1094
01:21:59,466 --> 01:22:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't Joe Montana.

1095
01:22:00,867 --> 01:22:03,569
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Jerry Rice Dog Football.

1096
01:22:04,269 --> 01:22:08,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out on the Wii last year, about a year ago, actually, because I remember... Okay.

1097
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:14,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the problem is that was Joe Montana, who's kind of, you know, he's long... It's Jerry Rice.

1098
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:14,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

1099
01:22:14,918 --> 01:22:23,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Jerry Rice also kind of, you know, it's not that hot-ass ref that they had on the Puppy Bowl the past couple years.

1100
01:22:23,585 --> 01:22:24,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this year.

1101
01:22:24,245 --> 01:22:25,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, you know why I failed?

1102
01:22:25,326 --> 01:22:26,367
[SPEAKER_02]: No kitten halftime, so...

1103
01:22:27,908 --> 01:22:28,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

1104
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:32,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jerry Rice and Nidus Dog Football was the game.

1105
01:22:32,295 --> 01:22:40,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have any – I have a – the talk about chicks and football and all this has me thinking about one of my good friends and I follow her on Facebook and all this.

1106
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,271
[SPEAKER_10]: She's getting really into roller derby lately.

1107
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any good roller derby experiences on consoles?

1108
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:50,723
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to say, I thought there was a roller derby game, but probably not.

1109
01:22:51,003 --> 01:22:52,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there is a roller derby game.

1110
01:22:52,964 --> 01:22:53,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is sad.

1111
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:57,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, perhaps... There's quite a roller derby audience, though.

1112
01:22:57,308 --> 01:22:59,129
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got, like, a trading card and everything.

1113
01:22:59,209 --> 01:22:59,890
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.

1114
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:11,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps, you know, they will come out with one because, you know, there was... There's been plenty of games for, like, what was it...

1115
01:23:14,392 --> 01:23:17,297
[SPEAKER_02]: for lacrosse and for rugby and that kind of stuff.

1116
01:23:17,437 --> 01:23:19,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we'll see that.

1117
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:24,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I am seeing, though, there is... Yeah, Jam City Roller Girls was actually a game that came out.

1118
01:23:25,089 --> 01:23:25,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1119
01:23:26,391 --> 01:23:28,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on, I think, the Wii?

1120
01:23:31,092 --> 01:23:35,157
[SPEAKER_10]: Stan in our chatroom says, you mean Asuka?

1121
01:23:35,237 --> 01:23:39,462
[SPEAKER_10]: She was the girl that was on the tester who was on the show about six months ago at this point.

1122
01:23:40,803 --> 01:23:42,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I follow her on Twitter, but not Facebook.

1123
01:23:42,965 --> 01:23:45,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And I forgot, she does Roller Derby too, that's right.

1124
01:23:45,208 --> 01:23:46,770
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this is a different friend I'm thinking of.

1125
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:47,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, WeWear.

1126
01:23:47,991 --> 01:23:49,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on WeWear, Jam City Roller Girls.

1127
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:56,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an authentic, well, I don't know how authentic, but it is a roller derby game.

1128
01:23:56,778 --> 01:23:58,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do have one.

1129
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:00,080
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1130
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,141
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one.

1131
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:03,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, they should have more than one.

1132
01:24:03,943 --> 01:24:04,723
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks decent.

1133
01:24:06,464 --> 01:24:06,724
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1134
01:24:06,744 --> 01:24:07,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me move on.

1135
01:24:07,405 --> 01:24:08,125
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to go to this.

1136
01:24:08,165 --> 01:24:08,466
[SPEAKER_10]: This is...

1137
01:24:12,133 --> 01:24:12,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

1138
01:24:12,934 --> 01:24:14,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to put this out there.

1139
01:24:14,715 --> 01:24:18,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And, Alan, I'll wait for you to make some smart-ass comments so you get ready, okay?

1140
01:24:19,479 --> 01:24:24,102
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even really want to plug the website by saying its name, but I'm going to have to.

1141
01:24:24,243 --> 01:24:27,745
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to just preface this by saying I ain't endorsing this shit.

1142
01:24:27,865 --> 01:24:30,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have to report on how ludicrous it is, all right?

1143
01:24:31,328 --> 01:24:38,693
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a new website out there, and it's basically, from what it sounds like, it's kind of like Adult Friend Finder, but for gamers.

1144
01:24:38,713 --> 01:24:39,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

1145
01:24:39,554 --> 01:24:41,856
[SPEAKER_10]: and it's called Shag-A-Gamer.

1146
01:24:42,976 --> 01:24:44,897
[SPEAKER_10]: It's launched in the United Kingdom.

1147
01:24:45,298 --> 01:24:45,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1148
01:24:45,598 --> 01:24:45,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1149
01:24:46,038 --> 01:24:50,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine that's in the United Kingdom with it being called Shag-A-Gamer.

1150
01:24:50,621 --> 01:24:54,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't believe anybody uses the phrase Shag.

1151
01:24:54,343 --> 01:24:54,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they do.

1152
01:24:55,384 --> 01:24:58,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time they see Austin Powers, they want to say Shag.

1153
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:01,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Austin Powers featuring a British spy.

1154
01:25:02,548 --> 01:25:03,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, baby.

1155
01:25:05,461 --> 01:25:09,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's some current stuff there.

1156
01:25:09,503 --> 01:25:11,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Current material you got working there.

1157
01:25:12,105 --> 01:25:18,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Austin Powers, a franchise that hasn't been around for years now.

1158
01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:23,572
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what they're calling the number one adult site for gamers.

1159
01:25:23,592 --> 01:25:24,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course they're calling it.

1160
01:25:25,513 --> 01:25:26,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're number one.

1161
01:25:26,594 --> 01:25:28,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, who's their competition?

1162
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1163
01:25:32,264 --> 01:25:32,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

1164
01:25:33,345 --> 01:25:39,386
[SPEAKER_09]: They're offering their services to thousands of single gamers who want nothing more than a quick shag.

1165
01:25:40,486 --> 01:25:41,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, baby.

1166
01:25:43,107 --> 01:25:48,749
[SPEAKER_09]: For just £19.99 a month, you get full access.

1167
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:49,669
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a quote, quote.

1168
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:56,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Full access to young, old, exciting, sexy individuals wanting no strings sex.

1169
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:02,385
[SPEAKER_10]: They're apparently coming soon as a Shaga Gamer TV as well.

1170
01:26:02,965 --> 01:26:10,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I do want to say, and this is important in their quote, they do not mention female gamers.

1171
01:26:10,368 --> 01:26:11,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be all dudes.

1172
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:12,849
[SPEAKER_02]: All dudes.

1173
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:22,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically, yes, there are young, old gamers that want to have sex with no strings attached, but they're all dudes.

1174
01:26:22,913 --> 01:26:24,774
[SPEAKER_10]: The site continues, quote,

1175
01:26:53,321 --> 01:27:00,683
[SPEAKER_10]: and out of all those thousands of people that are hooking up, they have 56 followers on their Twitter.

1176
01:27:03,268 --> 01:27:07,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the OLR Twitter has something like 700 or 800 followers.

1177
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:13,292
[SPEAKER_10]: So would it be fair to say that if suddenly we said, you know what, we don't want to be just an internet radio show anymore.

1178
01:27:13,672 --> 01:27:16,813
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to be a place for casual gamers to find a fuck.

1179
01:27:17,253 --> 01:27:21,135
[SPEAKER_10]: We would be able to say, now we are the number one company.

1180
01:27:21,515 --> 01:27:23,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So suck it, Shagga Gamer.

1181
01:27:23,956 --> 01:27:24,796
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a problem with that.

1182
01:27:24,836 --> 01:27:25,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck.

1183
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan?

1184
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:34,821
[SPEAKER_06]: This just makes me curious as to how many hookups happen at E3 or PAX.

1185
01:27:35,221 --> 01:27:36,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Do people get laid at those cons?

1186
01:27:36,782 --> 01:27:38,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they do.

1187
01:27:38,142 --> 01:27:44,804
[SPEAKER_02]: PAX, there's been articles where people will post Craigslist notifications.

1188
01:27:44,964 --> 01:27:47,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a meetup for an orgy, basically, at PAX.

1189
01:27:47,764 --> 01:27:48,865
[SPEAKER_02]: They will do that.

1190
01:27:48,925 --> 01:27:50,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do that.

1191
01:27:51,105 --> 01:27:52,266
[SPEAKER_02]: and Anime Cons.

1192
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:55,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of geek sex going on.

1193
01:27:55,127 --> 01:27:57,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything with a furry crossover, then yes, obviously.

1194
01:27:57,828 --> 01:27:58,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Con?

1195
01:27:58,968 --> 01:28:00,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1196
01:28:00,469 --> 01:28:02,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think all the guys from VOG are going?

1197
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:03,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

1198
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean stuff that's set up like that on Craigslist, but just...

1199
01:28:07,492 --> 01:28:09,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hey, I see you at the Nintendogs.

1200
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:11,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm in that hotel, too.

1201
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:11,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Room 4?

1202
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:13,133
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some wine.

1203
01:28:13,193 --> 01:28:15,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they have a phrase for a reason.

1204
01:28:15,514 --> 01:28:17,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a fool and his money are easily parted.

1205
01:28:18,854 --> 01:28:20,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a sucker.

1206
01:28:20,335 --> 01:28:27,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, there are not sites like this that are, there's just tons of hot gamer girls just waiting around for someone to just fuck them.

1207
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:34,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are there any guys here that fuck me, me, Mrs. Attractive Gaming Loving Girl with big titties?

1208
01:28:34,777 --> 01:28:36,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, that does not exist.

1209
01:28:37,498 --> 01:28:37,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere!

1210
01:28:38,358 --> 01:28:42,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, all these sites that want to charge you money and stuff like that.

1211
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, there's a perfect, what was it?

1212
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:52,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the gaming one where you would join up and you'd play games with hot gaming girls and stuff like that.

1213
01:28:52,163 --> 01:28:55,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would, you know, have video cam time with you.

1214
01:28:56,064 --> 01:29:00,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And they may undress somewhat when you're playing Battleship or something.

1215
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:01,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, Alan.

1216
01:29:02,006 --> 01:29:03,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I might shag that gamer.

1217
01:29:04,904 --> 01:29:08,727
[SPEAKER_06]: That image on their splash page is hilarious.

1218
01:29:09,587 --> 01:29:18,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I can't tell if it's just a really cheap stock image photo that they just photoshopped the Shagged Gamer thing on his shirt or if that's an actual photo shoot.

1219
01:29:18,213 --> 01:29:19,154
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because she has it too.

1220
01:29:19,174 --> 01:29:19,634
[SPEAKER_06]: She has it too.

1221
01:29:19,714 --> 01:29:20,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could shop that.

1222
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:21,675
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hard.

1223
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:23,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a photo shoot that they had.

1224
01:29:24,077 --> 01:29:26,538
[SPEAKER_10]: About as hard as that might be right there.

1225
01:29:27,459 --> 01:29:28,680
[SPEAKER_10]: What am I pointing at, Alan?

1226
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:29,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1227
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Look how well defined that is.

1228
01:29:30,461 --> 01:29:32,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she's lifting his shirt.

1229
01:29:33,203 --> 01:29:34,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's a photoshop.

1230
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:39,428
[SPEAKER_06]: at his junk, I guess, but you don't need to lift his shirt.

1231
01:29:39,468 --> 01:29:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going on in that picture.

1232
01:29:40,969 --> 01:29:46,913
[SPEAKER_10]: But then they show some of the actual users of the site, and like, you know, Paula, 25, she's waiting to get shagged.

1233
01:29:50,576 --> 01:29:51,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1234
01:29:51,377 --> 01:29:52,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's my question, though.

1235
01:29:55,788 --> 01:29:57,771
[SPEAKER_10]: What is so gamer about this?

1236
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:04,261
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it like, you know, you want someone to fuck and then cuddle and play Skyrim with after?

1237
01:30:04,622 --> 01:30:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you just go on OkCupid and set gamer tags as your match?

1238
01:30:08,468 --> 01:30:10,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, only show me people that have this filter?

1239
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:12,333
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm thinking.

1240
01:30:12,553 --> 01:30:13,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1241
01:30:13,193 --> 01:30:13,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.

1242
01:30:13,994 --> 01:30:20,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even if you're looking to date somebody, there's even that Geek2Geek site, which I hear is okay.

1243
01:30:21,158 --> 01:30:30,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're better off with something like an OKCupid or Plenty of Fish or something like that, where it doesn't really cost you anything to do it.

1244
01:30:30,223 --> 01:30:34,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these sites, they basically, oh, yeah, it's free to sign up, free to sign up.

1245
01:30:34,225 --> 01:30:37,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you sign up, and then you're like, oh, I want to talk to this person.

1246
01:30:37,467 --> 01:30:39,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to send them a message saying, yes, I would like to fuck you.

1247
01:30:40,308 --> 01:30:42,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, that's going to cost you money.

1248
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:43,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not a premium member.

1249
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:45,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you become a premium member.

1250
01:30:46,595 --> 01:30:49,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, you're not blah, blah, blah.

1251
01:30:50,058 --> 01:30:51,740
[SPEAKER_02]: You need more money to do this.

1252
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:53,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it this way.

1253
01:30:53,182 --> 01:30:57,326
[SPEAKER_02]: These people that they have, the models that they have here are not on their fucking site, okay?

1254
01:30:57,386 --> 01:30:57,786
[SPEAKER_10]: really tiny, really

1255
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:23,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1256
01:31:23,502 --> 01:31:24,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyway.

1257
01:31:43,871 --> 01:32:06,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've spent far too much time on this topic yeah just don't give them your time I mean that's basically the moral of the story just go to Craigslist but be careful like there's some real freaky people on Craigslist Craigslist is just weird freaky people let's go to a time when games were a lot similar

1258
01:32:10,425 --> 01:32:16,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Back when we were innocent and we weren't thinking about such pervert things.

1259
01:32:17,547 --> 01:32:19,368
[SPEAKER_10]: The classic game of the week.

1260
01:32:20,028 --> 01:32:28,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week, DarkSakura goes into the vault and finds a classic game that she deems worthy of you to revisit all over again.

1261
01:32:28,671 --> 01:32:38,173
[SPEAKER_10]: But since she's at a wedding, Alan's here and he dug into the shoebox to find the classic game that he thinks you all should play this week.

1262
01:32:38,313 --> 01:32:39,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, what is the classic game of the week?

1263
01:32:40,475 --> 01:32:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week is a LucasArts game on the Scum Engine.

1264
01:32:45,177 --> 01:32:45,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Came out in 1993.

1265
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,898
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Maniac Mansion, Day of the Pinnacle.

1266
01:32:49,578 --> 01:32:50,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Good pick.

1267
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:52,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Got any audio for me?

1268
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:54,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting some up right now.

1269
01:32:54,980 --> 01:32:56,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Made a poop sound.

1270
01:33:01,161 --> 01:33:02,823
[SPEAKER_06]: This amazing intro.

1271
01:33:02,863 --> 01:33:08,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, this is the sequel to a previous Classic Game of the Week, Maniac Mansion, which came out in 1987.

1272
01:33:09,010 --> 01:33:14,496
[SPEAKER_06]: You play Bernard, who was one of the cast members of the first game.

1273
01:33:15,177 --> 01:33:17,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You are called back to the mansion by...

1274
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:44,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally blanking on his name, Dr. Fred, because the Purple Tentacle has drank some toxic sludge that made him super smart, and he's going to take over the world, so you and your two friends have to go back in time to prevent him from drinking the slime and becoming super smart, but something goes horribly wrong with the time machines that are made out of porta-potties.

1275
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:45,721
[SPEAKER_06]: They're modified porta-potties.

1276
01:33:49,139 --> 01:33:49,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to the audio.

1277
01:34:19,179 --> 01:34:36,035
[SPEAKER_06]: they fixed the engine that they used in this for Salmon Max Hit the Road which was the other game I was debating using tonight but yeah so you've got give, pick up, use, push, look at, open and you just click that you click on your verb and then you click on what you want and you interact with the puzzles that way

1278
01:34:36,996 --> 01:34:42,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Bernard stays in present day, his sort of overweight rocker friend, very hair metal.

1279
01:34:43,522 --> 01:34:51,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Hoagie goes into the future, and then she's kind of a Daria Morgendorfer, Ally Sheedy and the Breakfast Club kind of spazzy girl.

1280
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:54,211
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes back in time to the colonial ages.

1281
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:55,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy Edisons forever.

1282
01:34:55,912 --> 01:34:56,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have that backwards?

1283
01:34:57,093 --> 01:34:57,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget.

1284
01:34:58,234 --> 01:34:59,135
[SPEAKER_06]: She goes to the future.

1285
01:34:59,796 --> 01:35:00,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Hogi goes to the past.

1286
01:35:00,937 --> 01:35:01,337
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1287
01:35:01,698 --> 01:35:03,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I haven't played this game in years.

1288
01:35:03,539 --> 01:35:05,201
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's super awesome.

1289
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:11,927
[SPEAKER_06]: They went and looked at a bunch of Warner Brothers cartoons for the visual, like how they wanted to do the art direction.

1290
01:35:12,287 --> 01:35:15,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And also a lot of the sound effects are taken directly from the cartoons as well.

1291
01:35:17,432 --> 01:35:23,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's got Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are some of the cameos that Hoagie has to deal with in the past.

1292
01:35:24,837 --> 01:35:31,781
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has a great endgame when it all comes together and all the three characters are joined again.

1293
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:33,582
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of fun.

1294
01:35:34,402 --> 01:35:56,002
[SPEAKER_06]: this game also was one of the first few CD games for one it was a computer game that came out on CD-ROM and also had full voice acting which at the time I think King's Quest 5 the Sierra game which came out I think in 91 also had voice acting but a lot of it was really bad the voice acting in these LucasArts games even though for the early 90s are phenomenal

1295
01:35:57,714 --> 01:36:00,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing voice acting considering that it was new technology.

1296
01:36:00,315 --> 01:36:09,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when this came out on PC and PC were just getting talky video games, we were playing the Super Nintendo for about a year or two because that came out in 91.

1297
01:36:09,318 --> 01:36:11,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Just show the timeline of how the technology was.

1298
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:25,989
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I actually installed, I still have this, I have the original instruction booklet and the disc, and I installed DOSBox on my Windows 7 machine so I could play this in Salmon Max.

1299
01:36:26,289 --> 01:36:29,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Does this come on LucasArts' pack that's on Steam?

1300
01:36:31,573 --> 01:36:33,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Good old games has it, I want to say.

1301
01:36:34,074 --> 01:36:34,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about Steam.

1302
01:36:35,775 --> 01:36:38,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember there was some type of LucasArts mega pack of adventure games that was on.

1303
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's how you could get loom and shit.

1304
01:36:41,143 --> 01:36:41,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1305
01:36:42,365 --> 01:36:52,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And for people who are into emulators, DOSBox is just... You still need the game with DOSBox, but if you have SCUMM, SCUMM is also an emulator specifically for LucasArts games that run on this engine.

1306
01:36:52,939 --> 01:36:56,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft clarifies, nope, it isn't on Steam at all.

1307
01:36:56,401 --> 01:36:57,662
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is not a part of that pack.

1308
01:36:58,603 --> 01:36:59,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Go figure.

1309
01:36:59,824 --> 01:37:01,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Also some other comments on this game.

1310
01:37:01,685 --> 01:37:04,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Burr says, Day of the Tentacle is the best adventure game ever.

1311
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:09,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Dungeon Buster says, this was LucasArts at the height of awesome too.

1312
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:19,837
[SPEAKER_06]: This and Sam & Max, I don't want to try to put one over the other, but both of those games together are just phenomenal adventure games for that era of PC gaming.

1313
01:37:21,477 --> 01:37:24,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to say about Maniac Mansion Day of the Tentacle?

1314
01:37:26,199 --> 01:37:27,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Hilarious.

1315
01:37:27,319 --> 01:37:30,980
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the funniest games I've ever played aside from Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity.

1316
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:34,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, I'm sorry, Mike Judge wrote the script.

1317
01:37:34,441 --> 01:37:35,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a hilarious game.

1318
01:37:35,461 --> 01:37:38,082
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have to pick that next time.

1319
01:37:38,182 --> 01:37:38,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1320
01:37:39,442 --> 01:37:41,103
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say... There's...

1321
01:37:45,164 --> 01:38:01,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say that I'm trying to find the actual site for this rumor, but I think it might be Telltale Games, but someone somewhere wants to put out an episodic franchise that exists in the same universe that references Day of the Tentacle.

1322
01:38:01,437 --> 01:38:06,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that, because, you know, as much as people love this game, nothing ever really came after it, you know?

1323
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:08,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, Maniac Mansion 3, do you think we'd get?

1324
01:38:08,644 --> 01:38:11,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, LucasArts has been all about, literally, Star Wars games for what?

1325
01:38:12,948 --> 01:38:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much since, once this era ended, they've just been about Star Wars, really.

1326
01:38:16,292 --> 01:38:21,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And Grim Fandango was their last big splash in PC adventure games.

1327
01:38:22,258 --> 01:38:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, super awesome.

1328
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:24,481
[SPEAKER_06]: People should check it out.

1329
01:38:26,061 --> 01:38:31,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Maniac Mansion 2, Day of the Tentacle, or just Day of the Tentacle for short.

1330
01:38:31,746 --> 01:38:32,727
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Alan, good pick.

1331
01:38:33,788 --> 01:38:35,329
[SPEAKER_10]: A good PC adventure game.

1332
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:38,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1333
01:38:38,612 --> 01:38:48,761
[SPEAKER_10]: We have plenty more show when we come back, including Rapid Fire News, and we're going to revisit Xbox Security again, but this time it might not be as much ranting as it's been in the past.

1334
01:38:48,801 --> 01:38:53,025
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1335
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:08,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on Sunday, July the 22nd of 2012, with episode number 466 of our show.

1336
01:39:09,563 --> 01:39:11,104
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, not here tonight.

1337
01:39:11,204 --> 01:39:20,226
[SPEAKER_10]: She is at a wedding in Las Vegas, the wedding of Tiara and Dan from geek-life.com, and we want to once again wish them a very happy wedding.

1338
01:39:20,266 --> 01:39:24,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I see the pictures are starting to show up on Facebook, and all I can say is, aww.

1339
01:39:25,968 --> 01:39:38,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I promised a giveaway here in Part B, and again, this is a code generously donated to the show by Bashka, and you can visit his website, critcraft.blogspot.com, if you like World of Warcraft stuff.

1340
01:39:39,097 --> 01:39:46,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if you don't, he tends to have some other little gaming things that sneak in there too, and the types of stuff that a lot of OLR people, I bet, would be really into.

1341
01:39:47,823 --> 01:39:51,906
[SPEAKER_10]: What we are giving away, once again, it is a beta key for Ravaged.

1342
01:39:52,806 --> 01:39:57,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I can play this little gameplay trailer here that he sent me there on the Facebooks.

1343
01:39:58,871 --> 01:40:00,712
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess there's some gameplay in this trailer here.

1344
01:40:00,752 --> 01:40:08,598
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a first-person shooter that is set in a world ravaged by a polar shift pitting scavengers versus the resistance.

1345
01:40:08,818 --> 01:40:15,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So as soon as this ad finishes playing, I'll play a little clip of the gameplay trailer.

1346
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:26,629
[SPEAKER_10]: and we're going to give this away right now to somebody that is checked in at vognetwork.com and in our chat room and of course wants the code because I'm going to send them a private message and be like, are you going to use this code?

1347
01:40:27,169 --> 01:40:29,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they will use it, there you go.

1348
01:40:29,811 --> 01:40:31,812
[SPEAKER_10]: If they don't, then I'll give it away to somebody else.

1349
01:40:31,832 --> 01:40:32,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember this one.

1350
01:40:33,072 --> 01:40:35,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it looks like a lot of... This is the game that was supposed to be like Rage.

1351
01:40:36,534 --> 01:40:38,235
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how rage is supposed to be.

1352
01:40:38,255 --> 01:40:41,677
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, like fighting in Doom Buggies.

1353
01:40:41,737 --> 01:40:45,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of like Doom Buggies, planes, that type of stuff.

1354
01:40:45,759 --> 01:40:47,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1355
01:40:48,221 --> 01:40:50,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Might want a pretty decent computer in order to play this.

1356
01:40:53,397 --> 01:40:55,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see who we're going to give that away to.

1357
01:40:55,379 --> 01:40:57,161
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to do this live right now.

1358
01:40:57,221 --> 01:41:02,126
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm doing right now, I'm pulling up the list of people that are currently checked into the show.

1359
01:41:03,127 --> 01:41:07,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so I need you, Loki, you checked in.

1360
01:41:08,272 --> 01:41:09,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you trying to win this too?

1361
01:41:09,633 --> 01:41:10,935
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I just check in all the time.

1362
01:41:11,335 --> 01:41:13,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, pick a number between 1 and 30.

1363
01:41:15,079 --> 01:41:16,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, pick a number between 1 and 30.

1364
01:41:17,801 --> 01:41:45,443
[SPEAKER_10]: 23 23, so that's 31, 39, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 I want to see if that person is in chat right now Hopefully they have a similar name or I might not be able to identify them I think you can just Google a random number generator and put in the 1 to 30 It's more fun if I ask you I'm looking I don't see that person in chat right now I'm looking one more time

1365
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:47,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Just making sure.

1366
01:41:50,264 --> 01:41:52,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yeah, that person isn't in chat right now, so give me another number.

1367
01:41:53,808 --> 01:41:52,647
12.

1368
01:41:54,729 --> 01:41:52,647
12.

1369
01:41:55,690 --> 01:42:02,278
[SPEAKER_10]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

1370
01:42:00,736 --> 01:42:02,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure this person's in chat.

1371
01:42:03,399 --> 01:42:04,440
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Ragenator.

1372
01:42:04,681 --> 01:42:05,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if he wants it.

1373
01:42:12,947 --> 01:42:13,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be the guy, Gaiden

[SPEAKER_02]: It looked awesome.

1380
01:43:27,882 --> 01:43:31,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're even making it a little stranger.

1381
01:43:31,544 --> 01:43:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: They're adding Japanese businessmen to the game.

1382
01:43:36,506 --> 01:43:42,689
[SPEAKER_02]: There's DLC that's coming out that you can play as a salaryman.

1383
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:45,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, businessmen can be pretty savage, too.

1384
01:43:46,031 --> 01:43:46,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's be real.

1385
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:48,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can play the game.

1386
01:43:48,752 --> 01:43:50,093
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope you don't have to mate them.

1387
01:43:51,033 --> 01:43:52,114
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be weird.

1388
01:43:53,995 --> 01:43:55,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, so that'll be coming out.

1389
01:43:55,456 --> 01:43:57,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to the game when it finally makes it over here.

1390
01:43:58,458 --> 01:44:01,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft in chat says, isn't it being localized for the US?

1391
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:01,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1392
01:44:01,901 --> 01:44:02,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1393
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1394
01:44:03,902 --> 01:44:08,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray Deer at live.vognetwork.com says, I want to be the guy, damn it.

1395
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:11,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that's what a lot of people say playing that game.

1396
01:44:12,844 --> 01:44:15,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Manos, The Hands of Fate Manos, The Hands of Fate

1397
01:44:42,912 --> 01:44:43,713
[SPEAKER_02]: How bad is it?

1398
01:44:44,094 --> 01:44:44,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty bad.

1399
01:44:44,595 --> 01:44:46,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I've fallen asleep twice trying to watch it.

1400
01:44:46,659 --> 01:44:50,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, both times with Mr. Science Seeker 3000.

1401
01:44:50,226 --> 01:44:52,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wow, and it was still bad.

1402
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:54,334
[SPEAKER_02]: It was still so bad that I fell asleep.

1403
01:44:56,152 --> 01:44:56,512
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1404
01:44:57,153 --> 01:44:59,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's move on to some other stories.

1405
01:44:59,215 --> 01:45:02,178
[SPEAKER_10]: First up, Rock Band Blitz finally has a release date.

1406
01:45:02,679 --> 01:45:05,742
[SPEAKER_10]: They said it would come out this summer, and we're already about halfway through summer.

1407
01:45:06,122 --> 01:45:07,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we finally have a date for it.

1408
01:45:07,423 --> 01:45:10,747
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation, August 28th, Xbox Live.

1409
01:45:12,148 --> 01:45:14,190
[SPEAKER_10]: A day later, August 29th, it's going to cost you $15.

1410
01:45:16,772 --> 01:45:20,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And some more songs were revealed for the game that will be in the game.

1411
01:45:21,155 --> 01:45:26,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool and the Gang's Jungle Boogie, My Chemical Romances Sing, Fun's We Are Young.

1412
01:45:26,818 --> 01:45:30,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's like the song that won't go away off the radio at all.

1413
01:45:31,301 --> 01:45:33,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Avenged Sevenfold's So Far Away also there.

1414
01:45:33,742 --> 01:45:35,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of people very excited about this.

1415
01:45:35,924 --> 01:45:40,947
[SPEAKER_10]: It uses all the DLC from Rock Band that you might have built up on your hard drive.

1416
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:42,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're like me, you have a lot.

1417
01:45:43,857 --> 01:45:44,317
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1418
01:46:05,854 --> 01:46:06,214
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1419
01:46:06,294 --> 01:46:16,136
[SPEAKER_10]: An anonymous tech at NASA laser engraved the space core on a part that is going to be flying on a resupply craft to the International Space Station.

1420
01:46:16,556 --> 01:46:19,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Valve posted about it on their official portal blog on Friday.

1421
01:46:20,797 --> 01:46:21,937
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know who did it.

1422
01:46:21,997 --> 01:46:23,757
[SPEAKER_10]: It was an anonymous tech at NASA.

1423
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:33,259
[SPEAKER_10]: NASA did not endorse this, but it's happening because they actually laser engraved this little Wheatley in space.

1424
01:46:33,459 --> 01:46:34,259
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Wheatley.

1425
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:34,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a core.

1426
01:46:36,328 --> 01:46:36,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1427
01:46:49,674 --> 01:46:50,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's right.

1428
01:46:50,235 --> 01:46:50,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yeah, right.

1429
01:46:51,256 --> 01:46:51,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yeah.

1430
01:46:51,656 --> 01:46:53,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Wheatley Zemo about it and then there's the other guy in the background.

1431
01:46:53,778 --> 01:46:54,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1432
01:46:54,758 --> 01:46:56,360
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a little while since I beat Portal 2.

1433
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:57,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I beat it when it first came out.

1434
01:46:58,021 --> 01:46:58,581
[SPEAKER_10]: So, anyhow.

1435
01:47:00,203 --> 01:47:02,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you're going to kill me because I gave a little spoiler there, you know what?

1436
01:47:02,845 --> 01:47:05,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Game's been out a year and it's been on sale for like five bucks lately.

1437
01:47:05,647 --> 01:47:07,789
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm thinking you haven't played it at this point.

1438
01:47:11,011 --> 01:47:17,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, lastly, EA gets a lot of hate, but they did something that's pretty cool this week.

1439
01:47:17,912 --> 01:47:25,274
[SPEAKER_10]: They joined Microsoft, Viacom, Google, Zynga, another company that gets a lot of hate, and eBay on this that's pretty cool.

1440
01:47:25,695 --> 01:47:34,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a amicus brief that declares opposition to DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which legally defines marriage between a man and a woman.

1441
01:47:34,737 --> 01:47:46,680
[SPEAKER_10]: and EA in a press release said quote DOMA presents a number of problems for businesses like EA as it creates regulatory tax and discrimination complications for employers and that's why we're standing against it.

1442
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:54,882
[SPEAKER_10]: The underlying lawsuit impacts all employers no matter how big or small and no matter the industry and we encourage other businesses to join these efforts.

1443
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:56,182
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's pretty cool.

1444
01:47:56,302 --> 01:47:59,584
[SPEAKER_10]: EA's been pretty supportive of LGBT causes in the past.

1445
01:47:59,904 --> 01:48:03,606
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually marched in the Pride Parade in San Francisco and in Seattle.

1446
01:48:03,906 --> 01:48:08,728
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done their own It Gets Better campaign video that's available on YouTube as well.

1447
01:48:08,788 --> 01:48:16,911
[SPEAKER_10]: So a little less evil doing the right thing and standing against DOMA, which obviously we here at OLR also think is kind of crap.

1448
01:48:17,552 --> 01:48:20,753
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's move on with some more stories.

1449
01:48:22,685 --> 01:48:27,488
[SPEAKER_06]: The Los Angeles Comedy Club Laugh Factory, which is world famous.

1450
01:48:28,069 --> 01:48:32,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first stand-up comedian that ever performed there was Richard Pryor.

1451
01:48:34,072 --> 01:48:37,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave Chappelle has done like six-hour sets there.

1452
01:48:37,655 --> 01:48:38,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, world famous.

1453
01:48:38,815 --> 01:48:41,557
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a charity to help kids and all this stuff.

1454
01:48:41,697 --> 01:48:47,101
[SPEAKER_06]: They are coming out with a streaming channel for PS3 on PlayStation Network.

1455
01:48:48,021 --> 01:49:16,060
[SPEAKER_06]: PS3 only from this story $3 a month if you're a stand-up comedy nerd like myself and you listen to stand-up comic podcasts like Greg Proops and Aisha Tyler like I do you might like this I know stand-up comedy isn't really as relevant now as it was in the 90s but yeah Laugh Factory Los Angeles Club $3 a month both pre-recorded and live performances from stand-ups no real schedule yet on the content but if you're a comedy nerd

1456
01:49:17,601 --> 01:49:18,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got three bucks a month to burn.

1457
01:49:19,682 --> 01:49:20,283
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of neat.

1458
01:49:20,343 --> 01:49:20,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Something different.

1459
01:49:21,103 --> 01:49:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1460
01:49:21,704 --> 01:49:24,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Although you can get it for free through some of those other podcasts you mentioned.

1461
01:49:24,865 --> 01:49:25,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1462
01:49:25,506 --> 01:49:26,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's... Yeah.

1463
01:49:26,546 --> 01:49:31,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also the Dreamcast Classic Jet Set Radio.

1464
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:34,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very funky, amazing, cel-shaded game.

1465
01:49:34,531 --> 01:49:42,936
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming to iOS and Android this summer to complement the PC and Vita versions.

1466
01:49:43,416 --> 01:49:43,536
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1467
01:49:44,717 --> 01:49:49,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I remembered the Dreamcast one, the original, and it was an amazing game.

1468
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:55,942
[SPEAKER_06]: It eventually got too hard for me to like, I think by the time I unlocked the fourth or fifth character, it just got so hard I couldn't do it anymore.

1469
01:49:56,822 --> 01:50:04,085
[SPEAKER_06]: The learning curve for the controls was when you got it, you got it, but it took a while.

1470
01:50:04,205 --> 01:50:09,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot imagine how this is going to play on a touchscreen unless they really tweak the controls.

1471
01:50:09,587 --> 01:50:14,049
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, funky Jet Set Radio goodness coming to your phones this summer.

1472
01:50:16,638 --> 01:50:16,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1473
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:36,419
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you looking?

1474
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,100
[SPEAKER_10]: No, don't just say something.

1475
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:39,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't Google it.

1476
01:50:40,002 --> 01:50:39,902
17.

1477
01:50:40,102 --> 01:50:40,982
[SPEAKER_10]: 17.

1478
01:50:40,682 --> 01:50:40,982
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1479
01:50:41,042 --> 01:50:43,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So if Ragenator was 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

1480
01:50:46,366 --> 01:50:46,606
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1481
01:50:46,646 --> 01:50:48,908
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that person's in chat and I know he'll respond.

1482
01:50:49,548 --> 01:50:53,871
[SPEAKER_10]: That is VXJasonXV is number 17 to check in tonight.

1483
01:51:01,176 --> 01:51:01,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1484
01:51:01,936 --> 01:51:04,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy me a little time here, guys, while I send Jason a private message.

1485
01:51:08,337 --> 01:51:08,898
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

1486
01:51:25,242 --> 01:51:28,745
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to get into the Fugle question of the week here.

1487
01:51:28,906 --> 01:51:33,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and our Google+.

1488
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:35,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Put them together and you get Fugle.

1489
01:51:36,393 --> 01:51:37,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the music queued up this week, sorry.

1490
01:51:38,995 --> 01:51:39,176
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

1491
01:51:40,937 --> 01:51:43,779
[SPEAKER_10]: We read some of the responses here on the air.

1492
01:51:43,999 --> 01:51:46,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we'll get through all of them.

1493
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:51,144
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a lot of responses tonight, and there's no way I'm going to be able to read all of these.

1494
01:51:51,284 --> 01:51:56,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, please check out our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and our Google+.

1495
01:51:57,228 --> 01:51:59,470
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a few responses over there, too, believe it or not.

1496
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:02,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a URL for it.

1497
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:02,291
11094.

1498
01:52:02,872 --> 01:52:04,453
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

1499
01:52:04,513 --> 01:52:05,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to read the whole thing.

1500
01:52:05,454 --> 01:52:07,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go to Google+, and search for Orange Launch Radio.

1501
01:52:07,315 --> 01:52:07,995
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll find us there.

1502
01:52:08,576 --> 01:52:09,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the question of the week.

1503
01:52:10,937 --> 01:52:17,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a tricky question because obviously there was a lot of really tough stuff that happened over the weekend.

1504
01:52:17,162 --> 01:52:20,004
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just a lot of really unfortunate events.

1505
01:52:21,044 --> 01:52:26,728
[SPEAKER_10]: And when tragedy like this happens, unfortunately people like to point the finger at video games.

1506
01:52:27,689 --> 01:52:51,040
[SPEAKER_10]: and so I wanted to ask this question to our Facebook and Google communities and that is sometimes when tragedy happens commentators on big news channels are quick to blame video games for a person being so deranged what if anything can we do as a gaming community to stop this reputation and show that there are far more good people playing video games than bad you know because when that

1507
01:52:52,589 --> 01:52:56,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Incident happened in Aurora over the weekend, which was terrible.

1508
01:52:56,811 --> 01:53:05,656
[SPEAKER_10]: They splashed that guy all over the news, as the news tends to do, which is really unfortunate because they're just making him famous by doing that, which I hate.

1509
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:08,118
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be the victims we should be remembering, but anyhow.

1510
01:53:09,018 --> 01:53:13,482
[SPEAKER_10]: They always bring these commentators on because everybody wants to know, why'd he do it?

1511
01:53:13,882 --> 01:53:14,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Why'd he do it?

1512
01:53:14,482 --> 01:53:15,723
[SPEAKER_10]: What was going on in his head?

1513
01:53:15,803 --> 01:53:17,885
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a quiet kid and he went crazy.

1514
01:53:18,145 --> 01:53:18,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Why'd he do it?

1515
01:53:18,905 --> 01:53:19,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Why'd he do it?

1516
01:53:19,466 --> 01:53:22,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And somebody always inevitably says, video games.

1517
01:53:24,329 --> 01:53:25,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is ridiculous.

1518
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:32,772
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with playing video games is it's as common now to be playing video games as it is to watch TV, so you can blame TV now too?

1519
01:53:33,932 --> 01:53:42,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that rock music he was listening to, it was those comics he was reading, it was the TV he was watching, it was the movies he was watching, it was the drugs.

1520
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:49,210
[SPEAKER_10]: and some people blame Batman because he said when he got arrested or whatever that he was the Joker.

1521
01:53:49,871 --> 01:53:50,191
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?

1522
01:53:50,411 --> 01:53:51,952
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the goddamn Batman.

1523
01:53:52,192 --> 01:53:54,094
[SPEAKER_10]: You know who is to blame?

1524
01:53:54,774 --> 01:53:55,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Him.

1525
01:53:56,055 --> 01:53:56,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1526
01:53:58,077 --> 01:54:12,288
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a fake article that circulated on Tumblr the night that it happened saying that he was arrested in like Joker cosplay and which of course is full of shit not true but it's like why are people photoshopping fake

1527
01:54:14,249 --> 01:54:26,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like talking about him, but I will entertain that there was a picture of him with crazy hair that was on the internet.

1528
01:54:26,116 --> 01:54:27,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, anything can be photoshopped, I guess.

1529
01:54:28,418 --> 01:54:31,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was on his adult friend finder.

1530
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's those sexual deviants!

1531
01:54:34,338 --> 01:54:35,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, no, it was him.

1532
01:54:35,919 --> 01:54:36,859
[SPEAKER_10]: It was his fault.

1533
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:37,759
[SPEAKER_10]: He did it.

1534
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, whatever.

1535
01:54:39,100 --> 01:54:41,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, two words.

1536
01:54:41,601 --> 01:54:42,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck him.

1537
01:54:42,241 --> 01:54:42,542
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1538
01:54:43,202 --> 01:54:47,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get to, though, how do we keep the bad reputation off of gamers?

1539
01:54:47,524 --> 01:54:50,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's far more good people playing video games than there are bad.

1540
01:54:50,925 --> 01:54:52,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go to some of the answers on Facebook.

1541
01:54:53,026 --> 01:54:54,347
[SPEAKER_10]: RedTheHaze starts us off.

1542
01:54:54,387 --> 01:55:00,811
[SPEAKER_10]: The first thing we should do is not get online and attack the people who blame video games because it just proves them right.

1543
01:55:01,272 --> 01:55:02,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Think before you act.

1544
01:55:02,853 --> 01:55:07,856
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to bring ourselves out there and show our positive side and drown out the negative noise.

1545
01:55:08,356 --> 01:55:12,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Make a YouTube video or write up on how we are productive members of society.

1546
01:55:12,819 --> 01:55:14,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Just don't be an asshole on the internet.

1547
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:15,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It's as simple as that.

1548
01:55:16,721 --> 01:55:45,110
[SPEAKER_10]: or don't watch those news programs because they're sensationalist to get people to watch them Ronnie B says usually it's the news media so I'd ask them how is their constant coverage endorsement of graphic stories 24-7 any less likely to drive someone mad than a video game even if the results of a tragic event is inspired by a video game what can you do when the person is a grown adult there is already the ESRB in the US so I don't think you can really blame video games anymore and I think that's the best argument

1549
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:46,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1550
01:56:07,661 --> 01:56:12,002
[SPEAKER_10]: And part of the reason he did it was he said, I want to be famous.

1551
01:56:12,282 --> 01:56:14,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm going to be plastered all over the news.

1552
01:56:14,543 --> 01:56:15,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be famous.

1553
01:56:15,443 --> 01:56:16,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be the most famous.

1554
01:56:16,664 --> 01:56:17,264
[SPEAKER_10]: He said that.

1555
01:56:18,184 --> 01:56:23,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in this interesting, ironic twist, that all happened on September 10th, 2001.

1556
01:56:25,966 --> 01:56:50,201
[SPEAKER_10]: so he wasn't famous for very long because the media hopped right on to something else well he got his 15 minutes I mean and it's just like I'm not trying to be funny it's just this really hugely ironic thing and it just kind of points out I mean god I hate using that word in conjunction with such tragedy but you guys know you know what I'm getting at it's that he you know was driven by fame

1557
01:56:51,798 --> 01:56:53,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Attention whores, that's what they are.

1558
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:53,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, right here.

1559
01:56:56,384 --> 01:56:56,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1560
01:56:57,125 --> 01:57:01,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Clover N responds saying, promote all the charities connected to video gaming.

1561
01:57:02,832 --> 01:57:04,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Acidic Vampire says, nothing.

1562
01:57:05,155 --> 01:57:09,220
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a waste of time trying to educate our tards who scapegoat.

1563
01:57:10,552 --> 01:57:10,812
[SPEAKER_02]: The End

1564
01:57:31,986 --> 01:57:38,769
[SPEAKER_10]: WhyNot18is9 responds and says, Parents, it's not the only solution but a start on knowing what your kids are playing.

1565
01:57:39,169 --> 01:57:44,091
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's a problem with the kid's brain, then a video game might be the start of stifling the problem.

1566
01:57:44,291 --> 01:57:45,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I could be wrong, though.

1567
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:45,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Great show, guys.

1568
01:57:48,962 --> 01:57:49,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Picaruno says,

1569
01:58:08,642 --> 01:58:18,258
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're really interested in how TV really works from an insider's point of view, I urge you to watch Charlie Brooker's Screen Wipe, News Wipe, and Games Wipe on YouTube.

1570
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:21,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting comment from Picaruno, kind of from the inside.

1571
01:58:23,335 --> 01:58:25,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Last one from Facebook, Cody T says,

1572
01:58:49,927 --> 01:59:01,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So in conclusion, there is no good or even great way to get media to stop blaming it on video games because media is media and at the end of the day, true gamers know that it is not true.

1573
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:05,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Complicated issue.

1574
01:59:05,761 --> 01:59:06,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I go to Google, Alan?

1575
01:59:06,942 --> 01:59:20,790
[SPEAKER_06]: With all the, you know, with Chris Hardwick's franchise Nerdist and all this stuff, the progress that gamers have made with like PAX and just crossing into the mainstream and being more of an accessible thing for, you know...

1576
01:59:23,472 --> 01:59:33,596
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as niche as it once was, but the reality is that it's still considered for the people ages 45 and older who watch the news, who get really into this stuff.

1577
01:59:34,056 --> 01:59:36,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a part of the counterculture, I guess.

1578
01:59:36,197 --> 01:59:38,498
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still something that a lot of people can't relate to.

1579
01:59:39,178 --> 01:59:42,379
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes it a magnet, like Loki was saying about the sensationalism.

1580
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:50,123
[SPEAKER_06]: If he was a huge sports nut who was a jock who got super late in high school and he was just a big sports freak and did not...

1581
01:59:51,523 --> 01:59:56,784
[SPEAKER_06]: even own a console, they wouldn't pursue that angle because that's considered normal.

1582
01:59:56,804 --> 02:00:01,745
[SPEAKER_02]: They would pursue it as he was a sexual deviant because he had an adult friend finder profile.

1583
02:00:01,785 --> 02:00:10,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they would say, okay, well, what's the first thing we can find that's even a little bit not as bland and as mainstream as possible?

1584
02:00:10,947 --> 02:00:14,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games is often that thing because a lot of people over a certain age don't understand it.

1585
02:00:14,918 --> 02:00:25,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me ask this question, and I'm taking a devil's advocate angle, because I think a lot of this sensationalism happens because we just want to understand, as a society, why?

1586
02:00:26,307 --> 02:00:27,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did this happen?

1587
02:00:28,129 --> 02:00:33,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Why did evil, there's no other word to describe it, why did evil happen?

1588
02:00:33,614 --> 02:00:36,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did we as a society fail to allow this to happen?

1589
02:00:37,016 --> 02:00:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the other thing, too, is they keep saying he operated on his own, but how'd he get in the theater?

1590
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:42,181
[SPEAKER_02]: He bought a ticket.

1591
02:00:44,202 --> 02:00:45,442
[SPEAKER_10]: He had to suit up though, right?

1592
02:00:45,462 --> 02:00:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear what they got up to?

1593
02:00:48,123 --> 02:00:49,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is he going to hide an AR-15?

1594
02:00:50,164 --> 02:00:59,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Regardless, I mean, I believe I had heard something and read online he used an emergency exit to go to his car and propped it open so that he could get back in the theater.

1595
02:00:59,866 --> 02:01:05,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Regardless, the guy had his house booby-trapped to the nines to try and kill some policemen too.

1596
02:01:05,808 --> 02:01:08,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, he was clearly deranged in all sorts of ways.

1597
02:01:09,188 --> 02:01:10,149
[SPEAKER_10]: He thought of a way.

1598
02:01:10,609 --> 02:01:11,349
[SPEAKER_10]: He thought of a way.

1599
02:01:11,929 --> 02:01:12,610
[SPEAKER_10]: So whatever.

1600
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:16,813
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but again, let me go back to the devil's advocate question.

1601
02:01:17,654 --> 02:01:20,557
[SPEAKER_10]: What's wrong with wanting to know where did we fail as a society?

1602
02:01:22,618 --> 02:01:24,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the difficult question.

1603
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:38,472
[SPEAKER_06]: The easy question is to just say, this terrifies me and I'm confused and hurting and this is a horrible story, but the media is saying that it's video games and I'm old and I've never played those and I don't know anyone who plays those, so...

1604
02:01:39,072 --> 02:02:03,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I can sleep better at night knowing that it's that evil yucky thing that's influencing people to do this it's the quickest way to get people to like they need to associate something because they just they don't understand it and it's unfortunate that video games is often used because it's a billion dollar industry it's everywhere people will pay attention if you obviously lie and say bullshitty things about the industry that aren't true because people that play games know that it's not

1605
02:02:04,245 --> 02:02:06,266
[SPEAKER_06]: and hope it doesn't happen to them.

1606
02:02:26,021 --> 02:02:53,480
[SPEAKER_06]: you know because already people talking about well was he mentally ill had he tried to get help before and then he was denied help you know there are all these existential questions about what drives a person to do this but people need like they're like oh shit this like I'm terrified this is a horrible story if they can just make that mental association of oh he was influenced because of this maybe and that's scary and weird because I'm old and I don't know what that is they can get that they can pin their terror to something

1607
02:02:54,961 --> 02:02:59,230
[SPEAKER_06]: and because I think there is a youth angle to video games, that's...

1608
02:03:02,334 --> 02:03:04,595
[SPEAKER_06]: A good go-to for the media, if I'm making sense.

1609
02:03:04,955 --> 02:03:05,415
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you are.

1610
02:03:05,595 --> 02:03:06,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1611
02:03:06,256 --> 02:03:06,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1612
02:03:07,096 --> 02:03:10,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Osfer in chat says, Me and my mom went and saw the midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises.

1613
02:03:10,957 --> 02:03:15,179
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people told us that they were glad that we were okay, but I just shrugged it off.

1614
02:03:15,559 --> 02:03:18,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to let one guy ruin my movie-going experience.

1615
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:23,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also funny how now when I tell people they should see the movie, they tell me that they don't want to get shot.

1616
02:03:24,122 --> 02:03:25,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely ridiculous, which I agree with.

1617
02:03:26,223 --> 02:03:28,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what short-term memory...

1618
02:03:32,006 --> 02:03:35,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Those people have because it's really unfortunate.

1619
02:03:35,696 --> 02:03:38,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Evil people killed people while they were working.

1620
02:03:39,597 --> 02:03:40,277
[SPEAKER_10]: on 9-11.

1621
02:03:40,497 --> 02:03:45,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Evil people have shot people on college campuses and on high school campuses.

1622
02:03:45,539 --> 02:03:48,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Evil people have gone into fast food restaurants and shot people.

1623
02:03:48,080 --> 02:03:50,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it doesn't matter where you are.

1624
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:54,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's just the sad reality of the situation.

1625
02:03:54,722 --> 02:04:05,665
[SPEAKER_10]: To blame the movie and say, I'm not going to go see a midnight movie because I might get shot is incredibly ignorant and disrespectful of all the history that came before.

1626
02:04:06,405 --> 02:04:06,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I think.

1627
02:04:06,985 --> 02:04:07,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1628
02:04:07,385 --> 02:04:07,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I right?

1629
02:04:08,526 --> 02:04:08,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe?

1630
02:04:09,026 --> 02:04:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh?

1631
02:04:10,168 --> 02:04:10,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1632
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:35,774
[SPEAKER_10]: We still strive as a society to figure out where were the warning signs so we can catch it before this happens again.

1633
02:04:36,234 --> 02:04:37,775
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we stop it from happening again?

1634
02:04:38,575 --> 02:04:41,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, going to Google Plus quickly.

1635
02:04:43,857 --> 02:04:45,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Wendy S on Google Plus says,

1636
02:04:59,202 --> 02:05:02,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Ridiculous point in that millions play Skyrim or WoW.

1637
02:05:02,466 --> 02:05:09,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to agree with Mike, which I'll read in a minute here, that acting like ladies and gentlemen online and not accepting people being jerks will help as well.

1638
02:05:09,954 --> 02:05:17,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So let me go to that comment from Actdeft that said, well, for starters, stop acting like dicks on online games or when gaming other people in general.

1639
02:05:18,243 --> 02:05:24,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Second, stop acting like you're a badass know-it-all just because you play first-person shooter games, though this applies to other games too.

1640
02:05:24,708 --> 02:05:32,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, educate the other people that aren't playing video games and pretty much state to them that video games do not cause violence, and especially to parents.

1641
02:05:32,713 --> 02:05:35,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Proper education stops this kind of action.

1642
02:05:35,475 --> 02:05:40,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, most people have stopped blaming video games for this type of situations, at least in a general sense.

1643
02:05:41,339 --> 02:05:42,440
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple more comments quickly.

1644
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:43,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Redertainment.

1645
02:05:44,958 --> 02:05:45,198
[SPEAKER_10]: says,

1646
02:06:13,621 --> 02:06:15,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, Marilyn Manson then is on the warpath now.

1647
02:06:36,029 --> 02:06:51,104
[SPEAKER_10]: he's been charmed there's a whole nother thing Marilyn Manson has basically made a career off of attention grabbing and it's the same thing many people have done in our culture they've made millions off of grabbing attention Alice Cooper, Madonna Gaga

1648
02:06:52,285 --> 02:06:52,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

1649
02:06:53,486 --> 02:06:55,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, lastly, last comment.

1650
02:06:55,448 --> 02:06:58,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Preston Evans says, blame graduate studies for the shooting.

1651
02:06:58,251 --> 02:06:59,532
[SPEAKER_10]: He was studying neuroscience.

1652
02:06:59,672 --> 02:07:01,353
[SPEAKER_10]: That would do that to anyone's psyche.

1653
02:07:01,814 --> 02:07:07,639
[SPEAKER_10]: In reality, there is no current way to stop ridicule of one small part of our society for one great event.

1654
02:07:08,019 --> 02:07:11,102
[SPEAKER_10]: When all parties have a part in it, it's too hard to fix that.

1655
02:07:11,402 --> 02:07:17,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Just throw one to the wolves instead of all taking the slap on the cheek for your part in the grand plan.

1656
02:07:18,269 --> 02:07:18,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

1657
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:22,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I know that's a tough topic, guys.

1658
02:07:22,425 --> 02:07:29,730
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, again, on CNN, and this happened on CNN within hours, there's that pundit on the TV.

1659
02:07:30,191 --> 02:07:30,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It's video games.

1660
02:07:32,592 --> 02:07:34,454
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we have to put up with as a culture.

1661
02:07:34,754 --> 02:07:37,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So, some different ideas from our listeners on how to stop it.

1662
02:07:38,476 --> 02:07:38,997
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1663
02:07:39,937 --> 02:07:41,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Our Fugle Question of the Week.

1664
02:07:42,788 --> 02:07:45,209
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's try to lighten the mood up.

1665
02:07:46,049 --> 02:07:51,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get back into video games, talking about some less serious video games and so forth.

1666
02:07:51,992 --> 02:07:55,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Or in this case, I guess this is something a little serious going on on Xbox, right, Loki?

1667
02:07:55,974 --> 02:07:56,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1668
02:07:56,454 --> 02:08:00,696
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been secretly tightening their security.

1669
02:08:02,496 --> 02:08:08,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And this started, I guess, with the spring update that we just had, the one that prepped for the fall update, that kind of thing.

1670
02:08:10,219 --> 02:08:17,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it says they are encouraging people to check their security information, update their passwords.

1671
02:08:17,962 --> 02:08:25,584
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the update they said built on security enhancements for the near future.

1672
02:08:26,644 --> 02:08:29,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess they're working.

1673
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:32,966
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be something that they'll announce for the fall update or something like that.

1674
02:08:34,847 --> 02:08:54,149
[SPEAKER_02]: My thing is though, I understand that they're going to be secretly doing this stuff, but why go such a secret route with it unless, you know, maybe they're worried that if they said, oh yeah, we're updating our security, people would go, ah, so your security had issues that needed to be addressed and you just wouldn't admit to it.

1675
02:08:54,730 --> 02:09:03,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, when they do it secretly, it kind of makes me wonder, they really did have issues that needed to be addressed, and they just didn't want to cop to it.

1676
02:09:03,517 --> 02:09:11,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So either way, at least they're making a step in the right direction, I guess, but they didn't really say what security measures are being put in place that weren't in place before.

1677
02:09:11,843 --> 02:09:14,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I can understand the secrecy behind it.

1678
02:09:14,264 --> 02:09:22,571
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as critical as I've been of Microsoft on this whole issue in the past, I can understand why they don't want to give it all away, because they don't want to give the people that are hacking the accounts hints.

1679
02:09:22,591 --> 02:09:23,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1680
02:09:23,271 --> 02:09:27,374
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can understand why they're being very vague about it, and I'm strangely okay with that.

1681
02:09:27,735 --> 02:09:29,976
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad they have finally come out and said something.

1682
02:09:31,217 --> 02:09:31,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally.

1683
02:09:32,738 --> 02:09:35,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And that they have said that they've taken the measures to stop it.

1684
02:09:35,961 --> 02:09:46,189
[SPEAKER_10]: And I honestly think that hackedonexbox.com and their whole little report about that they were working customer service, I think that is directly to thank for this finally coming out.

1685
02:09:46,269 --> 02:09:46,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally.

1686
02:09:47,034 --> 02:09:49,457
[SPEAKER_02]: and then here's some of the details of stuff they do.

1687
02:09:49,477 --> 02:09:59,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We increase notifications to members whose accounts may be compromised to add proofs, update their passwords and if necessary contact Xbox support.

1688
02:09:59,466 --> 02:10:03,130
[SPEAKER_02]: This helps our team lock down an account quickly, investigate and restore the account.

1689
02:10:03,530 --> 02:10:04,310
[SPEAKER_02]: to his rifle owner.

1690
02:10:04,670 --> 02:10:13,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We've taken legal action to pull down online posts of gamertags, usernames, and passwords gathered from malware phishing schemes to help protect our members.

1691
02:10:14,393 --> 02:10:20,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Our live spring update included many behind-the-scenes improvements that help us build on security enhancements for the near future.

1692
02:10:20,855 --> 02:10:32,379
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sending unique codes to security phone numbers and secondary email addresses provided by members to verify authorization for Xbox.com purchases, account change attempts,

1693
02:10:33,139 --> 02:10:34,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Not staying from members trusted device.

1694
02:10:35,321 --> 02:10:39,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I can vouch for that for a fact because we've had to recently.

1695
02:10:41,018 --> 02:10:45,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know how much of a pain in the ass it is to stop their auto-renew?

1696
02:10:45,461 --> 02:10:57,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we had some other co-workers I've created accounts for on my old PC, but since I've worked at the company that I've worked at, I've switched PCs, and so they're asking me for a second verifiable thing.

1697
02:10:58,369 --> 02:11:02,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Problem is, though, is you can put any phone number you want in there, and they'll just call you with the security thing.

1698
02:11:02,531 --> 02:11:07,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So that doesn't really help you, but granted, it will give you a phone number that they can send that to.

1699
02:11:08,855 --> 02:11:09,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

1700
02:11:09,676 --> 02:11:10,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Or text it too.

1701
02:11:11,057 --> 02:11:12,879
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing too.

1702
02:11:13,059 --> 02:11:18,424
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of free texting programs out there that you can get a disposable number for that.

1703
02:11:19,205 --> 02:11:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an extra layer, but it's not foolproof.

1704
02:11:21,907 --> 02:11:27,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Have they finally programmed it in on the Xbox where it asks you for your card security code whenever you make a transaction?

1705
02:11:27,473 --> 02:11:28,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know that's available on Xbox.com.

1706
02:11:28,894 --> 02:11:28,934
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1707
02:11:28,954 --> 02:11:29,034
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1708
02:11:29,975 --> 02:11:30,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't they do that?

1709
02:11:31,236 --> 02:11:40,519
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have helped in so many situations because the hackers would not have all those card codes and only let a person do it like three times and then it removes the card from file.

1710
02:11:41,179 --> 02:11:42,900
[SPEAKER_10]: It would seem super easy.

1711
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:43,821
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the way to do it.

1712
02:11:44,641 --> 02:11:45,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I crazy?

1713
02:11:47,242 --> 02:11:49,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it wouldn't be as convenient to purchase stuff and that's...

1714
02:11:50,288 --> 02:11:53,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, too fucking bad because it's the right thing to do.

1715
02:11:54,311 --> 02:11:55,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the right thing is not profitable.

1716
02:11:56,893 --> 02:12:09,662
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we're working to reduce market incentives for criminal activity, engaging in identity theft, trading, and stolen accounts, and committing credit card fraud are illegal and violate our terms of use.

1717
02:12:09,882 --> 02:12:13,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Those involved in these activities, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1718
02:12:13,305 --> 02:12:13,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1719
02:12:13,985 --> 02:12:15,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So they get banned and blah.

1720
02:12:15,889 --> 02:12:16,851
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, though.

1721
02:12:17,191 --> 02:12:18,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Reduce market incentives.

1722
02:12:19,736 --> 02:12:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I remember, I believe Madden now started selling those cards, too, that FIFA was so popular for.

1723
02:12:25,527 --> 02:12:26,068
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those...

1724
02:12:28,154 --> 02:12:28,574
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1725
02:12:56,478 --> 02:13:03,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, moving on to another news story here, and this has to do with the Wii U. We haven't talked a lot about tonight, but there's still some rumblings going on.

1726
02:13:03,860 --> 02:13:05,321
[SPEAKER_10]: There's always new rumors every week.

1727
02:13:05,861 --> 02:13:07,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And this time it's about Borderlands 2.

1728
02:13:08,402 --> 02:13:12,443
[SPEAKER_10]: But Gearbox, actually, the co-founder, Brian Martell, came out and said...

1729
02:13:13,530 --> 02:13:18,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Good things about the Wii U. Quote, we really like the Wii U. I think it's a really cool platform.

1730
02:13:18,434 --> 02:13:23,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I like what they're doing, obviously with the touchscreen, and it will be interesting to see what Microsoft does with their approach to that idea.

1731
02:13:24,758 --> 02:13:26,319
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those problems of the Wii.

1732
02:13:26,419 --> 02:13:29,542
[SPEAKER_10]: The only people who have ever made a lot of money on the Wii is Nintendo.

1733
02:13:30,322 --> 02:13:36,649
[SPEAKER_10]: If Borderlands 2 was on the Wii U, the thing I would most be excited about is inventory management.

1734
02:13:37,150 --> 02:13:38,451
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be amazing on that.

1735
02:13:38,491 --> 02:13:39,673
[SPEAKER_10]: It would just be fantastic.

1736
02:13:40,013 --> 02:13:44,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the artwork would look really good with the way they can deal with the resolution and textures.

1737
02:13:44,638 --> 02:13:45,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a really good console.

1738
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:49,984
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of people are jumping ahead and saying, confirmed, Borderlands 2 on Wii U.

1739
02:13:52,025 --> 02:14:17,327
[SPEAKER_02]: well of course they want to port it to any system they can and if it's easy to port it over then cool but once again it's kind of running into that same issue with what did DS do all the time oh well put the pause screen stuff the inventory stuff on the bottom screen instead of you know having to be a separate screen so do I really want to buy another system so that I don't have to pause my game to change my inventory I don't fucking care I'll pause my game to change my inventory and not have to buy another system for $300

1740
02:14:21,297 --> 02:14:26,723
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's assuming, you know, you're a person who doesn't end up buying it for some other reason.

1741
02:14:26,823 --> 02:14:27,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

1742
02:14:27,423 --> 02:14:34,351
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, though, you know, all those inventory things at the bottom screen, you still have to look away from the screen to do all that shit.

1743
02:14:34,531 --> 02:14:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

1744
02:14:37,193 --> 02:14:54,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Also in related news about the Wii U, another Wii U game, this one's called Rise of the Guardians, has been given a November release date, November 23rd for the 3DS, DS, 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Wii U. So this is another game being released in November.

1745
02:14:54,943 --> 02:14:55,804
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, come on.

1746
02:14:56,904 --> 02:14:59,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Game system to be out by November 23rd.

1747
02:14:59,106 --> 02:15:01,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas, Christmas.

1748
02:15:01,807 --> 02:15:04,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I really need to... Yeah, I'm going to do it again.

1749
02:15:05,069 --> 02:15:06,490
[SPEAKER_02]: November 18th!

1750
02:15:06,690 --> 02:15:08,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming out fucking November 18th.

1751
02:15:09,431 --> 02:15:12,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that for sure, but it's coming out November 18th.

1752
02:15:13,153 --> 02:15:13,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

1753
02:15:13,553 --> 02:15:16,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Because everything points to November 18th as the day.

1754
02:15:17,515 --> 02:15:19,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't wait for it to not be that day.

1755
02:15:19,456 --> 02:15:21,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to play that clip on repeat.

1756
02:15:23,718 --> 02:15:25,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Within seven days, November 18th.

1757
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:27,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you care to make a bet?

1758
02:15:27,700 --> 02:15:28,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a costume.

1759
02:15:29,521 --> 02:15:30,501
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a costume.

1760
02:15:30,541 --> 02:15:31,422
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not exist.

1761
02:15:32,662 --> 02:15:33,023
[SPEAKER_02]: November 18th.

1762
02:15:35,656 --> 02:15:38,599
[SPEAKER_02]: $249 to $349 price range because of three different SKUs.

1763
02:15:38,659 --> 02:15:39,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We already covered this on another show.

1764
02:15:40,851 --> 02:15:42,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back in the archives and find it.

1765
02:15:42,752 --> 02:15:44,653
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Alan, what do you got for us?

1766
02:15:45,454 --> 02:15:50,196
[SPEAKER_06]: In the silly and weird lawsuit department, there's this story that's come out.

1767
02:15:50,696 --> 02:15:59,962
[SPEAKER_06]: A company based out of Texas, excuse me, a tech patent collector, Unilock is the name of the company, has filed suit against Mojang.

1768
02:16:00,422 --> 02:16:05,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojang, as some people may realize or remember, is a Marcus Persons company.

1769
02:16:05,505 --> 02:16:07,526
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the developer and creator of Minecraft.

1770
02:16:08,506 --> 02:16:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: So this company, Unilock, is suing Mojang for... And this is a typo in the thing that was put out to Mojang, the notice they're being sued.

1771
02:16:22,254 --> 02:16:27,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Minecraft with a D. So there's a typo in the claim that gets the name of the product wrong.

1772
02:16:28,738 --> 02:16:31,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically for the Android version of Minecraft...

1773
02:16:34,423 --> 02:16:42,795
[SPEAKER_06]: The patent that they are accusing Mojang of infringing is a system and method for preventing unauthorized access to electronic data.

1774
02:16:43,536 --> 02:16:44,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that a password?

1775
02:16:45,698 --> 02:16:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm kind of ignorant about this patent.

1776
02:16:48,602 --> 02:16:50,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't read the whole thing because it's very dry.

1777
02:16:51,285 --> 02:17:15,152
[SPEAKER_06]: but specifically the filing references claim 107 of the patent which covers a computer code executable on an electronic device to prevent unauthorized access to electronic data stored on the electronic device so I don't know if it's the certain system or style that Minecraft is doing this on the Android but they're saying oh yeah we did that and only we can do that so they're suing it and Notch

1778
02:17:15,752 --> 02:17:19,955
[SPEAKER_06]: has said, unfortunately for them, they are suing us over a software patent.

1779
02:17:20,055 --> 02:17:23,058
[SPEAKER_06]: If needed, I will throw piles of money making sure they don't get a cent.

1780
02:17:23,998 --> 02:17:25,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Software patents are plain evil.

1781
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:29,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Innovation within software is basically free and it's growing incredibly rapid.

1782
02:17:30,143 --> 02:17:31,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Patents only slow it down.

1783
02:17:32,425 --> 02:17:39,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Unilock is seeking damages compounded by both pre- and post-judgment interest as well as ongoing royalties from Mojang.

1784
02:17:40,311 --> 02:17:41,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like, what the fuck?

1785
02:17:41,852 --> 02:18:08,946
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah and it's not not Minecraft the PC platform but specifically the Android one for whatever reason and not just saying lol at you all right um this does sound a little patent trollish to me right yeah it's just me because they got the name of the product wrong in the in the suit wow

1786
02:18:10,117 --> 02:18:13,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, good luck with that, guys.

1787
02:18:13,339 --> 02:18:14,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Moving on, Loki.

1788
02:18:16,561 --> 02:18:18,783
[SPEAKER_02]: People are really trying to get me to wear that Tingle suit.

1789
02:18:18,823 --> 02:18:19,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen.

1790
02:18:20,344 --> 02:18:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to happen.

1791
02:18:22,005 --> 02:18:23,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you lost your opportunity.

1792
02:18:23,686 --> 02:18:27,369
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have bought more copies of... What was that again?

1793
02:18:27,389 --> 02:18:29,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember the name of the title.

1794
02:18:29,390 --> 02:18:30,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, Eye of Judgment.

1795
02:18:31,472 --> 02:18:32,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown Eye of Judgment.

1796
02:18:33,733 --> 02:18:33,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

1797
02:18:34,754 --> 02:18:36,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's talk a little bit about Ouya.

1798
02:18:38,636 --> 02:18:39,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, it's...

1799
02:18:40,819 --> 02:18:41,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben Wattaweek.

1800
02:18:42,860 --> 02:18:47,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So, of course, you know, they've been doing updates on the Kickstarter.

1801
02:18:48,244 --> 02:19:01,033
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the updates that they did to kind of get people to trust them a little bit more, they let them know that one of the people on the production team is actually the guy that helped launch the Amazon Kindle line.

1802
02:19:02,634 --> 02:19:05,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Mufi Gadali, I believe.

1803
02:19:05,897 --> 02:19:06,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1804
02:19:08,098 --> 02:19:08,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Godly?

1805
02:19:08,779 --> 02:19:11,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you pronounce his last name.

1806
02:19:11,742 --> 02:19:16,226
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in charge of the Kindle line.

1807
02:19:17,487 --> 02:19:21,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, his purpose there is to make sure that the system launches.

1808
02:19:22,232 --> 02:19:29,518
[SPEAKER_02]: My job at OUYA is to ensure that we meet the needs of gamers and developers and

1809
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:38,046
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to get out the software development kit as quickly as possible to prospective developers.

1810
02:19:38,667 --> 02:19:41,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, they're hiring engineers to join their team as well.

1811
02:19:43,832 --> 02:19:49,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other announcements that they made regarding the Ouya is that they're going to have an exclusive game to it.

1812
02:19:50,417 --> 02:20:04,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Bulling's Human Element is going to have a prequel on the system Human Element is going to be a zombie game that's going to be coming out on consoles in 2015 that's a long time

1813
02:20:06,005 --> 02:20:32,439
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's going to have a prequel that's going to be launching on OUYA first actually at the launch of the console and it's going to kind of follow the events that lead up to the actual Human Element game of course also you may remember Robert Brolin from his new studio Robotoki and he originally was one of the developers for Call of Duty Modern Warfare and

1814
02:20:34,727 --> 02:20:35,267
[SPEAKER_02]: So, pretty cool.

1815
02:20:35,407 --> 02:20:38,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, he also donated $10,000 to the project as well.

1816
02:20:39,469 --> 02:20:42,691
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they've got lots of, you know, they have people sign on.

1817
02:20:42,751 --> 02:20:46,152
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a lot of indie developers that are kind of jumping on board as well.

1818
02:20:46,413 --> 02:20:48,974
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them actually have kick-started projects as well.

1819
02:20:50,454 --> 02:20:52,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at least there's going to be some games on there.

1820
02:20:52,235 --> 02:20:59,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been trying to answer questions and whatnot from the community regarding why we've seen a controller and that kind of stuff.

1821
02:20:59,819 --> 02:20:59,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1822
02:21:02,957 --> 02:21:06,458
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now that they have a game finally to talk about, what do you think?

1823
02:21:07,638 --> 02:21:08,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it sounds like a cool game.

1824
02:21:08,818 --> 02:21:21,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what kind of a game it is, though, but there's a lot of other, like, you know, people that are in the Kickstarter, you know, world there, like, that want to bring their games to the console, like, one they're going to be talking about pretty soon.

1825
02:21:21,621 --> 02:21:23,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually...

1826
02:21:25,975 --> 02:21:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Very soon is another Shadowrun game.

1827
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: They're thinking about bringing that to OUYA as well.

1828
02:21:31,685 --> 02:21:37,455
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of games there right now saying, hey, if we get this game out, we're going to put it on OUYA as well.

1829
02:21:40,538 --> 02:21:41,479
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got support.

1830
02:21:41,619 --> 02:21:47,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just really early still in the development stage as far as the design.

1831
02:21:47,465 --> 02:21:52,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they haven't finalized a controller yet, but they're going to have one.

1832
02:21:55,253 --> 02:21:59,377
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a beta kit running or a prototype, and that's it.

1833
02:22:01,386 --> 02:22:06,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'm going to move on with another story here, but first, we finally gave that code away.

1834
02:22:07,329 --> 02:22:18,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of doing it to just somebody random, and unfortunately twice we hit people that weren't around, I finally put a call out in chat and I said, look, if you're going to use this code and you want the code, send me a private message right now.

1835
02:22:19,516 --> 02:22:26,980
[SPEAKER_10]: And I asked Alan to pick a random number, and the winner was Osfer, won the code, and yes, he's going to use it.

1836
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:28,361
[SPEAKER_10]: So, congrats.

1837
02:22:29,061 --> 02:22:29,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks again.

1838
02:22:30,302 --> 02:22:35,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry that contest was a little bit of a mess, but I thought we'd do something fun with the new website registration.

1839
02:22:35,784 --> 02:22:39,946
[SPEAKER_10]: But oops, I guess people were checking in and then leaving to get dinner.

1840
02:22:41,747 --> 02:22:42,307
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1841
02:22:42,808 --> 02:22:45,709
[SPEAKER_10]: At least we know it's going to get some good use because it was an opt-in thing that time.

1842
02:22:46,229 --> 02:22:46,489
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1843
02:22:48,914 --> 02:22:49,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to this.

1844
02:22:49,655 --> 02:23:03,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a little bit of a follow-up from last week because I remember we brought the first part of this up because I remember it was about that game on the iPhone that was heavily borrowing, quote, quote, assets from Torchlight and Torchlight was pissed.

1845
02:23:04,965 --> 02:23:10,088
[SPEAKER_10]: So they, you know, I guess they went and they went on a Twitter rampage and all this stuff.

1846
02:23:10,428 --> 02:23:11,689
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the interesting thing.

1847
02:23:11,789 --> 02:23:17,713
[SPEAKER_10]: The company, EGLS, actually came out and made a statement about

1848
02:23:18,933 --> 02:23:20,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, oh gosh, where is this here?

1849
02:23:20,774 --> 02:23:33,340
[SPEAKER_10]: EGLS went to Touch Arcades and said, we hardly agree with Travis Baldry from Runic Games, who judged that EGLS wholesale stole most of the assets from Torchlight.

1850
02:23:34,600 --> 02:23:38,202
[SPEAKER_10]: EGLS is Entertainment Game Labs, by the way, who is the developer behind this.

1851
02:23:39,382 --> 02:23:42,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Only based on the similarity between several small monsters.

1852
02:23:43,084 --> 02:23:44,945
[SPEAKER_10]: The judgment is simply untenable.

1853
02:23:45,925 --> 02:23:49,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, except there's a little more to that.

1854
02:23:49,628 --> 02:23:55,211
[SPEAKER_10]: EGLS employees say they are, quote, both crazy game fans and ecstatic movie lovers.

1855
02:23:55,651 --> 02:23:58,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So the comparisons are an accident at best.

1856
02:23:58,893 --> 02:24:03,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Arm Heroes, the last time they checked, was still available on iTunes.

1857
02:24:03,416 --> 02:24:05,097
[SPEAKER_10]: It's free to play with purchases.

1858
02:24:05,458 --> 02:24:07,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what ended up happening a little later?

1859
02:24:07,779 --> 02:24:12,382
[SPEAKER_10]: EGLS did come out and say, all right, we'll remove some parts of the game.

1860
02:24:13,022 --> 02:24:17,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So they talk about that they are going to make some small changes to the game.

1861
02:24:18,984 --> 02:24:23,005
[SPEAKER_10]: But Runic Games really wants EGLS to admit that they just stole it.

1862
02:24:23,365 --> 02:24:23,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did.

1863
02:24:23,845 --> 02:24:26,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually stole even the audio from the game.

1864
02:24:26,246 --> 02:24:31,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were some unused audio clips, like a certain sword or something like that, that they have in Torchlight.

1865
02:24:33,328 --> 02:24:36,129
[SPEAKER_02]: All the audio files were named exactly the same as Torchlight.

1866
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:36,869
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.

1867
02:24:37,109 --> 02:24:38,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even stuff that they didn't use.

1868
02:24:39,235 --> 02:24:40,837
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, I also downloaded the app.

1869
02:24:40,857 --> 02:24:43,160
[SPEAKER_10]: You can unzip them and look at any iPhone app.

1870
02:24:43,180 --> 02:24:50,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was a sound manifest that listed all the sound files in the game and they were verbatim all of our sound files including our own misspellings.

1871
02:24:50,749 --> 02:24:50,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

1872
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1873
02:24:52,651 --> 02:24:53,993
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they stole them.

1874
02:24:55,549 --> 02:25:17,704
[SPEAKER_10]: yikes now armed heroes online is now down i guess runic filed a complaint and finally it got taken down but it took a little while that was on when did it finally get pulled july 19th that was thursday when it finally got pulled and we reported on that last week i wonder how many people uh grabbed that game

1875
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:23,312
[SPEAKER_10]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says they're in China, so there was nothing legal they could do.

1876
02:25:23,512 --> 02:25:27,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they can't sue the company, but they can fight them through Apple.

1877
02:25:27,755 --> 02:25:29,116
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they did, apparently.

1878
02:25:29,256 --> 02:25:32,398
[SPEAKER_02]: They can also reinforce stereotypes regarding China.

1879
02:25:33,699 --> 02:25:36,300
[SPEAKER_10]: What, that it's thieves and gold farmers and all this?

1880
02:25:37,021 --> 02:25:38,181
[SPEAKER_02]: MMOs and all this, or what?

1881
02:25:38,482 --> 02:25:43,765
[SPEAKER_02]: They copy and counterfeit stuff.

1882
02:25:45,485 --> 02:25:46,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1883
02:26:10,419 --> 02:26:31,569
[SPEAKER_10]: hmm but it's gone now and let's I wonder if Apple actually like really hammered the band hammer on them because you know Apple usually when shit like this happens Apple will just say you've lost your license done you're not getting to put publish anymore but most of them just come back under another name you're not gonna publish anymore until you pay another hundred dollars to buy a different license under a different name exactly

1884
02:26:32,748 --> 02:26:46,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura, she usually dives into the mailbag headfirst to read some of her favorite emails, but in her absence, she's loaned the hazmat suit to Alan, who will dive into the email bag.

1885
02:26:47,283 --> 02:26:50,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to state this, we received a lot of emails this week, actually.

1886
02:26:50,687 --> 02:26:51,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a bunch.

1887
02:26:53,610 --> 02:26:57,293
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird because usually we're sitting here with one or two going, send us more.

1888
02:26:57,673 --> 02:26:58,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you sent more this week.

1889
02:26:59,115 --> 02:27:03,219
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's what we're going to do because we don't have enough time to read, especially after some of the other segments tonight.

1890
02:27:03,239 --> 02:27:04,840
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have enough time to read all the emails.

1891
02:27:05,261 --> 02:27:08,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have Alan read the first half of the emails that came in.

1892
02:27:08,904 --> 02:27:11,447
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to roll the second half to next week.

1893
02:27:11,707 --> 02:27:12,748
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1894
02:27:27,697 --> 02:27:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: First email is from Robert M, subject 3 questions.

1895
02:27:31,761 --> 02:27:36,646
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Robert M and I just had 3 somewhat quick questions, or rather 2 and an observation.

1896
02:27:37,187 --> 02:27:40,130
[SPEAKER_06]: First, have you guys had the chance to check out Spelunky yet?

1897
02:27:40,370 --> 02:27:46,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw on a preview of the 360 version that someone did a Mac port, so it's one of my Steam shortcuts now.

1898
02:27:46,636 --> 02:27:50,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Reportedly, Steam may be getting a version of the game with the 360s graphics and extra modes.

1899
02:27:51,658 --> 02:27:54,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, if you're too... I haven't checked it out.

1900
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:55,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1901
02:27:56,461 --> 02:27:58,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Blame the rest of the Steam sale on that one.

1902
02:27:58,902 --> 02:28:00,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I haven't checked it out.

1903
02:28:00,803 --> 02:28:08,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, if you're too busy with Minecraft based on what you know, do you see updates for the iOS version falling by the wayside with the Android version?

1904
02:28:09,947 --> 02:28:34,001
[SPEAKER_10]: because I don't really follow the Minecraft forums enough to I haven't played the iOS version at all it's kind of like for iOS game it's kind of expensive which is ridiculous because I have like $19 credit on my iTunes account right now thanks to gift cards but I don't know I just I've kind of avoided it for some inexplicable reason but you have it don't you Matt have what Minecraft on iOS uh I have it on Android oh you have it on Android

1905
02:28:36,064 --> 02:28:42,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think that, I mean, Minecraft on PC is so popular because it's pretty, it's like limitless, right?

1906
02:28:42,747 --> 02:28:43,887
[SPEAKER_06]: The world just goes on forever.

1907
02:28:44,047 --> 02:28:44,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1908
02:28:44,347 --> 02:28:49,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can do that on the phone, and I think the 360 has really taken off, so maybe.

1909
02:28:49,250 --> 02:28:51,210
[SPEAKER_02]: The phone's really limited what they've got in there.

1910
02:28:51,230 --> 02:29:00,014
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of, like, there's object types that aren't there, and there's a lot of things that you have unlimited supplies of because they don't have a waste.

1911
02:29:00,194 --> 02:29:29,440
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah technically the 360 version is limited too but there was a story that came out this week they've sold 3 million copies of that it's one of the biggest Xbox Live Arcade titles ever crazy finally going back to the email finally not a question I came across a banner ad for one of those free to play Empire building games with the mandatory woman in the image being Anna Williams as in literally the Tekken 6 character art weird I'm almost certain Namco has nothing to do with this FTP keep up the great shows it's probably from China

1912
02:29:30,781 --> 02:29:31,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

1913
02:29:31,401 --> 02:29:34,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to refer you to that story we just read.

1914
02:29:34,364 --> 02:29:39,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to say, just rewind the podcast 10 minutes and go back to that last story.

1915
02:29:39,549 --> 02:29:40,650
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably what's going on.

1916
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:43,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless it's an Amco game, but I kind of doubt that.

1917
02:29:43,692 --> 02:29:46,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Anna Williams, by the way, was an amazing tech and character, just saying.

1918
02:29:47,135 --> 02:29:47,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved her.

1919
02:29:47,916 --> 02:29:52,060
[SPEAKER_06]: This one I'm not going to read because I think that's an admin question for you.

1920
02:29:52,140 --> 02:29:52,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1921
02:29:52,600 --> 02:29:53,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't read that one.

1922
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:54,562
[SPEAKER_10]: That is one we can screen out.

1923
02:29:55,243 --> 02:29:55,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1924
02:29:59,096 --> 02:30:01,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email from Jeffrey Help!

1925
02:30:02,259 --> 02:30:05,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a support group to help me stop buying all of the games in the summer Steam sale?

1926
02:30:06,724 --> 02:30:11,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a transdermal patch to slowly meter out old video games that I will probably never play.

1927
02:30:11,808 --> 02:30:13,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you came to the wrong place.

1928
02:30:15,371 --> 02:30:37,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I've picked up a couple indie bundles the THQ pack and a few other odds and ends I most likely won't touch half of the games included I'm just interjecting my own note here for all of the games that I bought this weekend or on this week under the sale I don't have the hard drive space to install like half of them at once so yeah it's very easy to have hundreds of gigs of games in your library

1929
02:30:39,601 --> 02:31:01,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I most likely won't touch half the games included now I see what happens to old people when they watch QVC that shit is no joke my mother is addicted to QVC and she'll never admit it and she'll hate me for telling you that's a very prescient and terrifying observation and it is 100% correct oh my god Steam is QVC without the host but at least QVC has like Marie Osmond and shit

1930
02:31:02,253 --> 02:31:03,193
[SPEAKER_10]: True story, you guys.

1931
02:31:03,234 --> 02:31:05,274
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I've mentioned this on the show before for the new listeners.

1932
02:31:05,335 --> 02:31:06,775
[SPEAKER_10]: True story, you guys.

1933
02:31:07,436 --> 02:31:13,418
[SPEAKER_10]: My mother owns the complete Richard Simmons doll collection from QVC.

1934
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:17,861
[SPEAKER_10]: They're all old lady dolls, too.

1935
02:31:17,981 --> 02:31:21,002
[SPEAKER_10]: My mother loves Richard Simmons.

1936
02:31:22,343 --> 02:31:22,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Doll form.

1937
02:31:24,864 --> 02:31:26,845
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she legit loves him.

1938
02:31:30,580 --> 02:31:32,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Please give me some tough love.

1939
02:31:32,383 --> 02:31:35,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we need like a Scared Straight program for Steve Sales.

1940
02:31:36,670 --> 02:31:37,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1941
02:31:37,352 --> 02:31:40,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it's just like spending money I don't have.

1942
02:31:42,282 --> 02:31:43,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Please give me some tough love.

1943
02:31:43,622 --> 02:31:44,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me to stop.

1944
02:31:45,383 --> 02:31:49,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I could also accept encouragement, but that would be detrimental to my wallet.

1945
02:31:49,644 --> 02:31:53,325
[SPEAKER_06]: As always, love the show and thanks for the years of entertainment, Lab Rat, Y2K.

1946
02:31:53,905 --> 02:31:58,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I'm going to say you came to the wrong place because you probably heard the first 30 minutes of the show.

1947
02:31:58,986 --> 02:32:03,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I would like to see happen a little bit more.

1948
02:32:04,699 --> 02:32:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: To help offset the whole buyer's remorse thing, I would like to see more of an organization of certain gaming nights.

1949
02:32:11,645 --> 02:32:13,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, let's all play Borderlands.

1950
02:32:14,046 --> 02:32:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought it, let's go play it.

1951
02:32:15,247 --> 02:32:18,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, hey, let's play some Armored 2 DayZ or something like that.

1952
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, hey, let's play this together so that it's not like, why did I buy this game?

1953
02:32:24,555 --> 02:32:25,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did I buy Borderlands?

1954
02:32:25,595 --> 02:32:30,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, to play with other people that have the PC version, but I'm not actually going to play with other people that have the PC version.

1955
02:32:30,675 --> 02:32:33,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Lab Rat, Y2K, let me just put it this way.

1956
02:32:33,458 --> 02:32:35,360
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can't beat them, join them.

1957
02:32:35,961 --> 02:32:38,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Join the VOG Network community on Steam.

1958
02:32:38,443 --> 02:32:44,730
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also an Orange Launch Radio community, but we're trying to kind of push people more to the general VOG one now so we can be even bigger.

1959
02:32:45,391 --> 02:32:48,434
[SPEAKER_10]: And more information is available at vognetwork.com.

1960
02:32:49,095 --> 02:32:51,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know this one's long, but it's pretty good.

1961
02:32:51,577 --> 02:32:51,838
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1962
02:32:53,018 --> 02:32:53,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll read it.

1963
02:32:53,518 --> 02:32:55,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you mind reading it?

1964
02:32:55,299 --> 02:32:56,239
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a long email.

1965
02:32:56,299 --> 02:32:56,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1966
02:32:56,619 --> 02:32:56,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1967
02:32:56,979 --> 02:32:57,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1968
02:32:57,939 --> 02:32:58,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's it from first?

1969
02:32:58,979 --> 02:32:59,919
[SPEAKER_10]: Read who it's from first.

1970
02:33:00,699 --> 02:33:01,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonic Vision.

1971
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:01,800
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1972
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:02,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Now you can read it.

1973
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:03,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

1974
02:33:04,440 --> 02:33:04,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.

1975
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:05,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.

1976
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:06,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to address this in the chat.

1977
02:33:07,001 --> 02:33:10,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Technus in chat says, Richard Simmons scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

1978
02:33:11,481 --> 02:33:11,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1979
02:33:12,602 --> 02:33:14,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Did his nut fall out of his shorts?

1980
02:33:14,162 --> 02:33:15,402
[SPEAKER_10]: He's harmless.

1981
02:33:16,402 --> 02:33:20,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, that guy takes a lot of shit, and he really is just trying to be a good person.

1982
02:33:22,028 --> 02:33:22,568
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1983
02:33:47,434 --> 02:33:49,235
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a healthy dose of fabulous.

1984
02:33:50,295 --> 02:33:52,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

1985
02:33:53,937 --> 02:33:54,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Clearly.

1986
02:33:55,838 --> 02:33:56,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, Alan?

1987
02:33:57,639 --> 02:33:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

1988
02:33:59,559 --> 02:34:01,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying out there.

1989
02:34:01,820 --> 02:34:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's what's making him so spunky at age 60...

1990
02:34:05,262 --> 02:34:05,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1991
02:34:06,242 --> 02:34:07,082
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more.

1992
02:34:07,583 --> 02:34:09,363
[SPEAKER_10]: I am being completely real.

1993
02:34:09,503 --> 02:34:10,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

1994
02:34:10,163 --> 02:34:12,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Travis, you play this clip over and over on your show if you want.

1995
02:34:13,044 --> 02:34:13,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

1996
02:34:13,564 --> 02:34:14,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Make fun of me.

1997
02:34:14,484 --> 02:34:16,565
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more people like Richard Simmons in the world.

1998
02:34:16,625 --> 02:34:16,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Really.

1999
02:34:17,245 --> 02:34:19,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there is nothing wrong with Richard Simmons.

2000
02:34:19,986 --> 02:34:23,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Richard Simmons is the antithesis of the evil we were talking about earlier.

2001
02:34:24,827 --> 02:34:25,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

2002
02:34:26,007 --> 02:34:27,148
[SPEAKER_10]: What is wrong with Richard Simmons?

2003
02:34:28,308 --> 02:34:28,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing.

2004
02:34:30,180 --> 02:34:30,561
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

2005
02:34:43,402 --> 02:34:44,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, OLR.

2006
02:34:45,203 --> 02:34:46,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Tonic Vision.

2007
02:34:47,385 --> 02:34:50,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a chance yesterday to go check out the Wii U in person.

2008
02:34:51,347 --> 02:34:56,551
[SPEAKER_06]: They are doing a Tensity Tour and inviting Club Nintendo members and wanted to share my impressions with you.

2009
02:34:56,911 --> 02:35:02,195
[SPEAKER_06]: To preface, I would just like to say that I don't consider myself to really be a fanboy of any particular system.

2010
02:35:02,555 --> 02:35:08,497
[SPEAKER_06]: and don't really have a vested interest in one over another because to me they all have various strengths and weaknesses.

2011
02:35:08,777 --> 02:35:17,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I own basically every current system including the 3DS and the Vita and am generally excited enough by next generation hardware to be a consistent early adopter.

2012
02:35:18,020 --> 02:35:24,942
[SPEAKER_06]: With that said, I really cannot find any way to get excited about the Wii U even after hands-on play with each and every launch title.

2013
02:35:25,322 --> 02:35:25,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is this?

2014
02:35:26,083 --> 02:35:29,005
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it is because of the following three reasons.

2015
02:35:29,045 --> 02:35:34,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So this guy got an exclusive invite to some top secret come play the Wii U in an unmarked building type of thing?

2016
02:35:34,850 --> 02:35:38,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I may actually have an impression of the Wii U after this week.

2017
02:35:39,814 --> 02:35:44,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Ubisoft guy may be bringing a Wii U to our game conference thing.

2018
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:46,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's probably for Just Dance 4.

2019
02:35:47,621 --> 02:35:48,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a Rabbids game on Wii U?

2020
02:35:49,022 --> 02:35:49,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there is.

2021
02:35:49,523 --> 02:35:49,863
[SPEAKER_02]: There is.

2022
02:35:50,223 --> 02:35:50,864
[SPEAKER_02]: May or may not.

2023
02:35:50,924 --> 02:35:53,526
[SPEAKER_02]: He's trying to get a Wii U dev kit out, but we'll see.

2024
02:35:55,743 --> 02:35:55,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Item 1.

2025
02:35:56,944 --> 02:35:58,705
[SPEAKER_06]: The name sucks, plain and simple.

2026
02:35:58,805 --> 02:35:59,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is this a big deal?

2027
02:36:00,206 --> 02:36:04,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big deal because it's indicative of the fact that Nintendo has become a little too comfortable.

2028
02:36:04,909 --> 02:36:06,250
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still a Wii, folks.

2029
02:36:06,770 --> 02:36:10,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it has a new controller, and yes, the graphics are prettier, but it is still a Wii.

2030
02:36:34,213 --> 02:36:37,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you bought on Super Nintendo.

2031
02:36:37,878 --> 02:36:42,344
[SPEAKER_10]: You take a PlayStation 3, and that's okay.

2032
02:36:42,405 --> 02:36:43,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Sequels to consoles are fine.

2033
02:36:43,827 --> 02:36:45,729
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with that.

2034
02:36:46,250 --> 02:36:47,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well, fuck me.

2035
02:36:47,291 --> 02:36:48,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess my whole point's invalid.

2036
02:36:48,974 --> 02:36:49,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Loki.

2037
02:36:49,835 --> 02:36:50,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen the light.

2038
02:36:52,694 --> 02:37:01,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think he's saying that aside from the graphics hardware, I mean, the Nintendo to the Super Nintendo was a huge step in audio, visual.

2039
02:37:01,902 --> 02:37:03,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Mode 7 fucked your shit up.

2040
02:37:03,983 --> 02:37:06,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Rob, let me put it this way.

2041
02:37:07,526 --> 02:37:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's games on the, like, okay, the jump from the NES to SNES, so you have Zelda and Mario Brothers, and then you had Super Mario World and, you know, Zelda 3, Links to the Past.

2042
02:37:18,996 --> 02:37:21,618
[SPEAKER_02]: which are two of the best games ever fucking made.

2043
02:37:21,758 --> 02:37:22,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2044
02:37:22,519 --> 02:37:27,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were amazing fucking games and look at how much better they are than the previous system.

2045
02:37:29,284 --> 02:37:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we seeing that with the Wii U?

2046
02:37:30,985 --> 02:37:31,425
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.

2047
02:37:31,465 --> 02:37:35,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we have a new Mario game that's exactly like the fucking Mario game that's already on the Wii.

2048
02:37:35,848 --> 02:37:36,249
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thing.

2049
02:37:36,429 --> 02:37:38,851
[SPEAKER_02]: If they came out with a game that's like holy fucking shit that's

2050
02:37:39,491 --> 02:37:40,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Goddamn amazing.

2051
02:37:40,491 --> 02:37:43,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much better than the previous Mario game where, oh my god, look at this Zelda game.

2052
02:37:43,933 --> 02:37:44,913
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking amazing.

2053
02:37:44,953 --> 02:37:46,474
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much better than the one in the Wii.

2054
02:37:47,234 --> 02:37:49,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Then maybe it'd be a different story, but it's not.

2055
02:37:49,675 --> 02:37:54,036
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the same fucking game, slightly prettier, but basically the same.

2056
02:37:55,837 --> 02:37:57,198
[SPEAKER_10]: It is hard to argue with that.

2057
02:37:57,278 --> 02:38:02,259
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing I could say is that the Zelda game wasn't a launch title, but granted the Mario game was.

2058
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:04,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the best is yet to come.

2059
02:38:05,261 --> 02:38:05,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope.

2060
02:38:06,061 --> 02:38:06,381
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

2061
02:38:08,257 --> 02:38:08,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I would.

2062
02:38:09,017 --> 02:38:09,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2063
02:38:35,527 --> 02:39:01,717
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just telling Alan last night we haven't ordered pizza in a long time and he's like oh you want to go to Papa Murphy's get a take and bake I'm like fuck you no I want bacon sausage that's right we are going like we're gonna call Straw Hat and we're gonna get it delivered in a box can you put a Christmas ham just right on the pizza when I worked at a pizza place I never got sick of pizza I could eat pizza every goddamn day and I would be happy eating pizza every day

2064
02:39:03,494 --> 02:39:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand the point.

2065
02:39:04,615 --> 02:39:06,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Item 3 The technology isn't new.

2066
02:39:06,917 --> 02:39:10,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I have played games on a touch screen and I've played games with motion control.

2067
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:15,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Putting them together is not innovative and really doesn't bring anything terribly exciting to the masses.

2068
02:39:15,443 --> 02:39:23,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Playing through each and every launch title I can say for a fact that not one of these really do something unexpected with the marriage of these two technologies.

2069
02:39:23,450 --> 02:39:29,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps a year or so after launch there will be a handful of third party titles that will push the envelope and do something daring.

2070
02:39:29,514 --> 02:39:32,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly Nintendo certainly won't be leading by example.

2071
02:39:33,217 --> 02:39:41,243
[SPEAKER_06]: For all of these, excuse me, for all of these reasons, I really find myself at a loss when attempting to justify this purchase at launch, or maybe at all.

2072
02:39:41,863 --> 02:39:53,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for the rant, but that was the feeling I was left with after two hours with the Wii U. And this, I mean, this guy's an Uber Nintendo fan because you had to be to get in the click to go see the system, right?

2073
02:39:53,852 --> 02:39:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2074
02:39:54,673 --> 02:39:57,197
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said that he doesn't really stand for any console.

2075
02:39:57,297 --> 02:39:58,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Enthusiast enough.

2076
02:39:58,799 --> 02:40:00,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then he's kind of like any of us.

2077
02:40:00,662 --> 02:40:06,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I like Nintendo, but I like Sony and Microsoft too.

2078
02:40:06,731 --> 02:40:07,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Some days.

2079
02:40:07,352 --> 02:40:07,853
[SPEAKER_10]: It just depends.

2080
02:40:08,113 --> 02:40:09,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's pissing me off this week?

2081
02:40:10,356 --> 02:40:29,677
[SPEAKER_06]: on a separate note I wanted to share with you another preview of some art that will be showcased at the upcoming video game power-up art exhibition this will increase your X attached here are some pixel sculptures we've created one of which was recently featured in your classic game of the week enjoy we encourage all OLR listeners in the Chicago area

2082
02:40:30,117 --> 02:40:31,498
[SPEAKER_06]: to come out and see the show.

2083
02:40:31,598 --> 02:40:34,619
[SPEAKER_06]: It opens Friday, August 3rd from 6 to 10 p.m.

2084
02:40:34,679 --> 02:40:40,102
[SPEAKER_06]: at Gallery 27 at 1833 Halstead and will be open every Friday throughout the month.

2085
02:40:40,222 --> 02:40:46,305
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also check out the show online at all one word gallery27chicago.com.

2086
02:40:46,345 --> 02:40:49,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll paste that in chat in a second if you can't make it in person.

2087
02:40:49,767 --> 02:40:51,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks and I hope to see you there, Tonic Vision.

2088
02:40:52,168 --> 02:41:04,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, none of us are in Chicago, at least here in the room, and I won't be through the area, but I know we have some listeners in Chicago, we have quite a few actually, so I expect a full report, tap tap tap

2089
02:41:06,255 --> 02:41:06,555
[SPEAKER_06]: One more?

2090
02:41:06,736 --> 02:41:08,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do one more, and that's just going to leave three left over.

2091
02:41:08,957 --> 02:41:10,598
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll figure out what we do with those emails later.

2092
02:41:10,618 --> 02:41:11,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll them over.

2093
02:41:11,479 --> 02:41:11,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2094
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:16,062
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from Nasty Canasta, Evening OLR Crew.

2095
02:41:16,242 --> 02:41:25,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Among all the discussion about theatrism's pricing on your show, Bobby Blackwolf's, and around the web, I thought it was interesting that nobody considered to bring up the Square Enix tax.

2096
02:41:26,690 --> 02:41:34,996
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been instances where RPGs and related titles published by Square Enix, especially re-releases, have a price that is artificially raised above the norm.

2097
02:41:35,317 --> 02:41:38,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Take Squeenix's PS1 Classics catalog, for example.

2098
02:41:38,739 --> 02:41:45,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas most games are priced at $5.99, Chrono Cross, Chrono Trigger, all Final Fantasies and Xenogears are worth $9.99 to purchase.

2099
02:41:45,885 --> 02:41:47,206
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why that is?

2100
02:41:47,246 --> 02:41:48,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you'll pay it.

2101
02:41:53,123 --> 02:41:53,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Plain and simple.

2102
02:41:54,244 --> 02:41:54,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Plain and simple.

2103
02:41:55,025 --> 02:41:56,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's really no other way to say it.

2104
02:41:57,027 --> 02:42:01,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Any Square fan is going to be, this is my own commentary, any Square fan is going to be cuckoo bananas about those games.

2105
02:42:01,751 --> 02:42:02,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're legendary.

2106
02:42:02,552 --> 02:42:04,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, aren't they larger games too?

2107
02:42:04,955 --> 02:42:07,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know Xenogears was two discs.

2108
02:42:07,377 --> 02:42:12,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Final Fantasy VII was three discs and Final Fantasy VIII was also three and nine.

2109
02:42:12,122 --> 02:42:13,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was four and two.

2110
02:42:13,763 --> 02:42:16,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I mean, yeah, but I mean, I don't know.

2111
02:42:16,226 --> 02:42:17,407
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, I understand what you mean.

2112
02:42:17,427 --> 02:42:19,790
[SPEAKER_06]: In this day and age, that's kind of a weak argument.

2113
02:42:19,990 --> 02:42:25,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Oddly, Front Mission 3 and Vagrant Story do not have inflated prices despite both having RPG elements.

2114
02:42:25,437 --> 02:42:27,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And those were more sleeper hits, too.

2115
02:42:27,539 --> 02:42:28,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Or cult hits.

2116
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:28,681
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true.

2117
02:42:28,721 --> 02:42:29,021
[SPEAKER_02]: For them.

2118
02:42:30,102 --> 02:42:31,464
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were also one disc.

2119
02:42:32,224 --> 02:42:37,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the tax also applies to titles available from Nintendo's Virtual Console service, at least in Japan.

2120
02:42:37,588 --> 02:42:38,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Nasty Canasta.

2121
02:42:39,269 --> 02:42:40,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that name, by the way.

2122
02:42:41,311 --> 02:42:47,715
[SPEAKER_06]: And wasn't when Secret of Mana was ported to iOS and put on the Apple Store, wasn't it like really expensive?

2123
02:42:47,735 --> 02:42:51,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was four or five bucks, which was outrageous for what it was, just a port of the SNES.

2124
02:42:51,858 --> 02:42:58,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say those games on Nintendo and Super Nintendo Virtual Console were like 100 Microsoft points more.

2125
02:42:58,823 --> 02:43:02,485
[SPEAKER_10]: or excuse me, wow, 100 Nintendo points more.

2126
02:43:03,486 --> 02:43:04,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm losing it tonight.

2127
02:43:04,947 --> 02:43:07,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I was distracted because look who came to say hello.

2128
02:43:08,088 --> 02:43:09,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Look who never comes out in the studio to say hello.

2129
02:43:09,970 --> 02:43:10,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Look who's here.

2130
02:43:10,410 --> 02:43:11,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Maruko.

2131
02:43:11,450 --> 02:43:12,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Kitty, kitty.

2132
02:43:12,071 --> 02:43:12,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Kitty.

2133
02:43:12,971 --> 02:43:13,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a comment, Maruko?

2134
02:43:17,574 --> 02:43:18,794
[SPEAKER_10]: He's sniffing the microphone.

2135
02:43:19,374 --> 02:43:20,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is your cat, by the way?

2136
02:43:21,775 --> 02:43:22,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Sanrio is doing much better.

2137
02:43:22,975 --> 02:43:26,636
[SPEAKER_06]: She just needed a day to have it, basically.

2138
02:43:27,716 --> 02:43:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: She gets constipated.

2139
02:43:29,477 --> 02:43:34,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And when she has a really bad hairball and she's plugged up, it'll tweak this nerve in her stomach.

2140
02:43:35,638 --> 02:43:37,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And it completely, like, knocks her out for a day.

2141
02:43:37,859 --> 02:43:39,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Where she just, she can't eat.

2142
02:43:39,399 --> 02:43:40,679
[SPEAKER_06]: She gets dizzy.

2143
02:43:40,719 --> 02:43:42,440
[SPEAKER_06]: If she walks, she'll stumble and fall down.

2144
02:43:42,800 --> 02:43:44,080
[SPEAKER_06]: She just needed a day to get better.

2145
02:43:45,020 --> 02:43:47,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Kitty can't poop, but she can poop now.

2146
02:43:48,403 --> 02:43:49,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the TMI.

2147
02:43:50,805 --> 02:43:54,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really scary to see your cat completely out of it and you don't know what's wrong.

2148
02:43:55,339 --> 02:44:00,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and a really good friend of ours had to put down their cat this week, and I know that's really difficult.

2149
02:44:01,044 --> 02:44:05,368
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a long time trying to get them better and figure out what was wrong with them, so they finally had to.

2150
02:44:06,789 --> 02:44:07,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough.

2151
02:44:07,790 --> 02:44:09,272
[SPEAKER_06]: We get really attached to our pets.

2152
02:44:09,932 --> 02:44:15,417
[SPEAKER_06]: So I love my kitty, and I'm glad that she's better, but I need to make sure that doesn't happen again, because I don't like seeing her like that.

2153
02:44:16,578 --> 02:44:17,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it for emails.

2154
02:44:18,260 --> 02:44:18,540
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2155
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:19,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Logi.

2156
02:44:45,703 --> 02:44:48,244
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to people that change lanes without signaling.

2157
02:44:48,264 --> 02:44:49,525
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of you out there.

2158
02:44:49,545 --> 02:44:51,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why people do that.

2159
02:44:51,686 --> 02:44:53,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really annoying.

2160
02:44:53,667 --> 02:45:04,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, FU to the Steam sale for... I guess I should blame myself, but I'm blaming the Steam sale for having me spend way more money than I wanted to on this Steam sale.

2161
02:45:04,991 --> 02:45:08,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And buying games that I will probably play, but...

2162
02:45:09,413 --> 02:45:12,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Right away, and it just adds more games to the list.

2163
02:45:13,374 --> 02:45:16,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, that's it.

2164
02:45:18,855 --> 02:45:19,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, you want to go?

2165
02:45:20,855 --> 02:45:28,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, on Friday night, I have this gorgeous 25-inch Hewlett-Packard monitor for my PC, the Pitchron.

2166
02:45:28,817 --> 02:45:29,337
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing.

2167
02:45:29,937 --> 02:45:35,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And on Friday night, it started to flicker, like there was maybe some EMF interference from a nearby appliance.

2168
02:45:37,038 --> 02:45:54,205
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe the backlight of the LCD was starting to go out which was terrifying because I don't want to buy any monitor right now so that sucked but I replaced the I took it off HDMI cable and I plugged it into my video card with a DVI cable and now it's fine so the HDMI cable

2169
02:45:55,285 --> 02:45:56,146
[SPEAKER_06]: went bad.

2170
02:45:56,426 --> 02:46:01,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to shitty $8 Amazon HDMI cables that make you think your monitor's dead.

2171
02:46:01,090 --> 02:46:03,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you should have got a $60 monster cable.

2172
02:46:03,632 --> 02:46:04,452
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same.

2173
02:46:04,472 --> 02:46:06,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Just buy the cheapest possible cable.

2174
02:46:06,394 --> 02:46:08,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was a Belkin on Amazon.

2175
02:46:08,175 --> 02:46:10,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It lasted two years, but I guess the HDMI cable went bad.

2176
02:46:10,858 --> 02:46:15,601
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to heart attacks that, yeah, over technology.

2177
02:46:15,621 --> 02:46:19,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Cablewholesale.com, they're damn cheap and it's one day shipping to us.

2178
02:46:20,445 --> 02:46:23,127
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I get cables when I happen to get cables.

2179
02:46:23,167 --> 02:46:23,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

2180
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:26,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they pay you for that app?

2181
02:46:26,561 --> 02:46:26,762
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2182
02:46:26,882 --> 02:46:27,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time they should.

2183
02:46:28,063 --> 02:46:29,204
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're SoCal.

2184
02:46:29,584 --> 02:46:30,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, no, they're not SoCal.

2185
02:46:30,605 --> 02:46:32,607
[SPEAKER_02]: They're somewhere in the Bay Area or something.

2186
02:46:32,847 --> 02:46:33,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's only a day.

2187
02:46:36,196 --> 02:46:37,517
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really have a lot of angst.

2188
02:46:37,557 --> 02:46:38,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Things are going pretty good.

2189
02:46:38,877 --> 02:46:42,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a lot going on, so F you to being really busy.

2190
02:46:42,938 --> 02:46:55,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm kind of obligated to something over the next couple months that's going to really cut into my weekends, which really stinks because I really need to get back to San Francisco and see Grandpa Warcraft and some other people over there and so on.

2191
02:46:55,262 --> 02:46:56,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to the fact...

2192
02:46:57,122 --> 02:47:03,003
[SPEAKER_10]: That the annual showing of Showgirls, which we must go to, is the same day as another theater thing I have here.

2193
02:47:03,043 --> 02:47:04,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got to make sure I can go.

2194
02:47:05,244 --> 02:47:08,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I love movie Showgirls.

2195
02:47:08,245 --> 02:47:09,105
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so bad, it's good.

2196
02:47:10,105 --> 02:47:10,845
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know shit.

2197
02:47:13,706 --> 02:47:14,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2198
02:47:17,447 --> 02:47:17,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

2199
02:47:19,409 --> 02:47:21,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, one more news story for us and then I've got something.

2200
02:47:21,711 --> 02:47:29,219
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that's the part where we get to taking your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2201
02:47:29,259 --> 02:47:30,680
[SPEAKER_10]: But after two more stories here.

2202
02:47:31,100 --> 02:47:34,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't go to both of those events because they're at different places, okay?

2203
02:47:38,147 --> 02:47:38,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

2204
02:47:38,928 --> 02:47:39,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen Showgirls.

2205
02:47:39,589 --> 02:47:39,889
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.

2206
02:47:39,969 --> 02:47:41,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy you made a Showgirls show.

2207
02:47:41,611 --> 02:47:43,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen Showgirls one too many times.

2208
02:47:44,335 --> 02:47:45,937
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was only because I wanted to see the boobies.

2209
02:47:46,177 --> 02:47:49,921
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the only reason to watch Showgirls more than one time anyway.

2210
02:47:51,223 --> 02:47:51,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

2211
02:47:52,605 --> 02:47:52,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2212
02:47:53,966 --> 02:48:16,882
[SPEAKER_02]: so let's talk a little bit about kickstarter because why not we we always talk about kickstarter because it's in the news all the time so a couple new games shadowrun online i'm kind of excited about that because shadowrun's pretty awesome um but they're starting a kickstarter they're looking to raise half a million dollars by august 14th so you can go check them out at kickstarter um

2213
02:48:19,739 --> 02:48:20,780
[SPEAKER_02]: DefenseGrid 2 DefenseGrid 2

2214
02:48:37,379 --> 02:48:37,639
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.

2215
02:49:02,703 --> 02:49:06,704
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 quarters of a million, you get a level editor, and then 1 million you get a sequel.

2216
02:49:07,844 --> 02:49:11,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of lame, but that's how they're doing it.

2217
02:49:12,045 --> 02:49:22,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And then last but not least, if you're looking for an alternative to Kickstarter, the website GamesPlanet has launched a new service called GamesPlanet Lab.

2218
02:49:22,927 --> 02:49:25,928
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a crowdfunding service.

2219
02:49:26,088 --> 02:49:26,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the UK.

2220
02:49:28,228 --> 02:49:51,459
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of cool because it's not US only because Kickstarter is US only so you have to have a way to pay via Amazon on that but it's based in Europe and they will have projects from around the world and already they've got a couple games on the service that you can fund one's MagRunner it's a title from 3AM Studios and

2221
02:49:53,421 --> 02:50:06,228
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like a first person puzzler game and then they've also got Day One which is like an adult themed point and click adventure game Like Leisure Suit Larry?

2222
02:50:07,352 --> 02:50:11,875
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's heavily influenced by the Devil's Dictionary.

2223
02:50:12,956 --> 02:50:14,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2224
02:50:14,677 --> 02:50:15,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Never heard of that.

2225
02:50:16,579 --> 02:50:17,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't really say.

2226
02:50:17,599 --> 02:50:29,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the difference with this service as opposed to Kickstarter, because I think one of the reasons people are kind of like, I don't know about crowdfunding and stuff, how we know we're actually in the game.

2227
02:50:29,467 --> 02:50:36,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have a process that they actually kind of review these games before they

2228
02:50:37,853 --> 02:50:39,313
[SPEAKER_02]: and allow them to be on the service.

2229
02:50:39,493 --> 02:50:43,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, it's only going to be games on this service since it is Game Planet Labs.

2230
02:50:46,297 --> 02:50:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of neat, I guess, if they have that.

2231
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:51,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So cool.

2232
02:50:52,159 --> 02:50:54,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the alternative if you want to check it out.

2233
02:50:54,260 --> 02:50:58,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I believe, at lab.gamesplanet.com.

2234
02:50:59,503 --> 02:51:00,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to say?

2235
02:51:01,264 --> 02:51:03,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lab.gamesplanet.com.

2236
02:51:05,256 --> 02:51:21,791
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, since you just did a bunch of Kickstarter-esque stuff here, this one is kind of another Kickstarter-inspired thing, but like it or not, Kickstarter is now kind of a part of pop culture right now, and that's probably one of those things that we'll look back on in 10 years and on the next VH1.

2237
02:51:21,971 --> 02:51:25,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the 2010 decade special.

2238
02:51:26,014 --> 02:51:30,939
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have someone there talking about how everybody was into Kickstarter and the other stuff it inspired.

2239
02:51:31,479 --> 02:51:32,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Nino Kuni, Wrath of the White Witch, Wizards Edition

2240
02:51:51,718 --> 02:51:57,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now they're expanding this for the US based on the number of pre-orders.

2241
02:51:57,942 --> 02:52:03,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So it doesn't say though what they will keep adding to it when they hit different levels.

2242
02:52:03,706 --> 02:52:06,647
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm going to the page right now, which you can get at ninostarter.com.

2243
02:52:07,868 --> 02:52:16,898
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't say exactly what you will unlock, but apparently if you hit these different pre-order goals, they're going to add stuff to the collector's edition, which is kind of cool.

2244
02:52:17,518 --> 02:52:18,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here it is, the first one.

2245
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:22,624
[SPEAKER_10]: The first item is a set of five Ni No Kuni prints.

2246
02:52:23,505 --> 02:52:26,628
[SPEAKER_10]: So little crappy little postcards, basically.

2247
02:52:27,229 --> 02:52:28,270
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if that's, you know.

2248
02:52:28,743 --> 02:52:29,804
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2249
02:52:51,138 --> 02:53:15,116
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah all right I think it'd be better if it was like the regular game and you know the more people that pre-order the game like more free shit like they upgrade it for free like do a special edition or something like that and have crap that they throw in there yeah that'd be a little bit better because collector's editions that's really a niche niche niche audience you're you're not going to niche game with a now you know collector's edition that's going to be even more niche than that

2250
02:53:15,467 --> 02:53:17,810
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $99, too, if you want that collector's edition.

2251
02:53:17,830 --> 02:53:18,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck that.

2252
02:53:18,591 --> 02:53:19,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, see, here's the thing.

2253
02:53:19,812 --> 02:53:31,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe it or not, I'm tempted, because I really do love the Studio Ghibli stuff, and the game looks good, but I feel really weird taking that leap of faith when I don't really know if the game's good or not.

2254
02:53:31,567 --> 02:53:32,928
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I could go look at some Japanese.

2255
02:53:32,968 --> 02:53:33,389
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty good.

2256
02:53:33,829 --> 02:53:35,712
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but just because it looks pretty good?

2257
02:53:35,932 --> 02:53:37,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, what have we learned?

2258
02:53:37,634 --> 02:53:41,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes games that look good don't really end up being very good or lasting a long time.

2259
02:53:41,980 --> 02:53:42,640
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know.

2260
02:53:43,782 --> 02:53:47,907
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do think that doll is really cute, though.

2261
02:53:49,649 --> 02:53:51,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And the DLC, might as well.

2262
02:53:51,892 --> 02:53:54,073
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow, we'll see.

2263
02:53:54,413 --> 02:53:55,754
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see if I get on board or not.

2264
02:53:55,774 --> 02:54:01,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, you have until August 31st to do this, and they even have the little countdown clock there on ninostarter.com.

2265
02:54:02,197 --> 02:54:05,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It says right now 2,683 fans.

2266
02:54:05,279 --> 02:54:07,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean that many people have pre-ordered, I'm assuming?

2267
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:08,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2268
02:54:09,161 --> 02:54:09,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

2269
02:54:10,501 --> 02:54:12,683
[SPEAKER_10]: But little trailers available there and everything.

2270
02:54:12,723 --> 02:54:13,503
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a cute little idea.

2271
02:54:14,502 --> 02:54:19,584
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2272
02:54:19,624 --> 02:54:26,506
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight or maybe there's a story you think we've missed, the Skype line is now open.

2273
02:54:27,487 --> 02:54:33,389
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get to last minute stories in a minute, but I also want to read some of the tweets that have come in at twitter.com slash OLR.

2274
02:54:34,289 --> 02:54:42,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to start off tonight with a tweet from Dave Falcon tweets us and says, a few days ago, I picked up Duke Nukem Forever at GameStop for $4.99.

2275
02:54:46,769 --> 02:54:49,220
[SPEAKER_10]: My How the Mighty Have Fallen and Fallen Quick

2276
02:54:51,314 --> 02:54:52,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you buy it for $4.99?

2277
02:54:52,274 --> 02:54:52,494
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2278
02:54:52,654 --> 02:54:53,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be curious.

2279
02:54:54,275 --> 02:54:56,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe.

2280
02:54:56,175 --> 02:55:00,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Gearbox made Borderlands, dude.

2281
02:55:00,736 --> 02:55:05,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that, and it's really sad what they had to work with for Duke Nukem.

2282
02:55:05,997 --> 02:55:07,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was kind of one of the things, too.

2283
02:55:07,498 --> 02:55:11,038
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they lost a lot of credit with that, but Borderlands 2 looks really awesome.

2284
02:55:11,458 --> 02:55:13,359
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let me go to the phones because we are getting a call.

2285
02:55:13,419 --> 02:55:14,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2286
02:55:14,419 --> 02:55:14,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2287
02:55:15,339 --> 02:55:16,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is X-Link.

2288
02:55:16,360 --> 02:55:17,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, X-Link, buddy.

2289
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:17,860
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2290
02:55:18,706 --> 02:55:19,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing really too much.

2291
02:55:19,846 --> 02:55:22,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Loki, I'm also hyped for Borderlands 2.

2292
02:55:22,147 --> 02:55:31,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy that Ashley is actually going to have a role inside of it playing as Tiny Tina, which is absolutely great because I love watching, hey, Ash, what you're playing.

2293
02:55:31,350 --> 02:55:33,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought she was great doing those.

2294
02:55:34,480 --> 02:55:41,802
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be kind of intriguing to see how all that works out after they bring everything to it.

2295
02:55:41,842 --> 02:55:47,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know too that they actually have the game already done so hopefully they'll patch up any kind of bugs or anything within that game.

2296
02:55:47,544 --> 02:55:49,465
[SPEAKER_10]: This hype train has me very interested.

2297
02:55:49,885 --> 02:55:52,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of the first one.

2298
02:55:52,206 --> 02:55:59,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the first one with all the DLC and actually I would like to team up with some people go through the arena part and get the rest of the achievements.

2299
02:55:59,268 --> 02:56:02,329
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the first arena by myself but the other ones are just

2300
02:56:04,371 --> 02:56:07,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear I will try and play the game soon.

2301
02:56:07,874 --> 02:56:10,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to remove it from my hard drive because I needed the disk space.

2302
02:56:10,956 --> 02:56:12,238
[SPEAKER_10]: But it'll be back.

2303
02:56:12,978 --> 02:56:14,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, a couple things real quick.

2304
02:56:14,379 --> 02:56:21,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Chaos Rings from Square Enix is $12.99 actually on the iOS store.

2305
02:56:21,346 --> 02:56:24,228
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sequel, which came out not too long ago, was actually $17.99.

2306
02:56:26,190 --> 02:56:28,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are really expensive compared to...

2307
02:56:28,952 --> 02:56:30,973
[SPEAKER_01]: to Xenogears and the rest of those for $9.99.

2308
02:56:31,494 --> 02:56:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather get those anyways, at least that way, you know, I would have a copy I could always play compared, you know, because, you know, stuff happens, you know, discs can break, you know, get scratched really easily.

2309
02:56:44,181 --> 02:56:45,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're very hard.

2310
02:56:45,381 --> 02:56:47,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are games also that are very hard to come by, too.

2311
02:56:48,203 --> 02:56:49,764
[SPEAKER_01]: You look on eBay, you're trying to find them.

2312
02:56:49,784 --> 02:56:53,566
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going up to $50, $70, $80 a pop for some of those games.

2313
02:56:53,646 --> 02:56:57,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to say, oh, well, you know, they're trying to, you know,

2314
02:56:57,869 --> 02:56:58,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Galza Price.

2315
02:56:58,651 --> 02:57:00,777
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 10 bucks is a very simple price.

2316
02:57:00,817 --> 02:57:01,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather pay 10 bucks than...

2317
02:57:02,977 --> 02:57:03,097
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 or 60.

2318
02:57:05,179 --> 02:57:06,420
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing with the Steam sales.

2319
02:57:06,861 --> 02:57:10,203
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the Dungeon Seed Collection for $7.49.

2320
02:57:10,404 --> 02:57:13,206
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like 75% off.

2321
02:57:13,286 --> 02:57:15,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought Brink for $5.

2322
02:57:15,428 --> 02:57:22,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a crappy game, but I like these little first person shooters from time to time after having a rough day at work, coming home and shooting something.

2323
02:57:22,594 --> 02:57:24,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great to have some of those stuff.

2324
02:57:24,475 --> 02:57:29,199
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course I bought for my girlfriend the Secret of the Magic Crystal for $1.25.

2325
02:57:29,240 --> 02:57:29,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So

2326
02:57:32,134 --> 02:57:34,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can't really beat those prices for the sales.

2327
02:57:35,115 --> 02:57:40,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at my iPad right now at the store, and yeah, I mean, Square really does charge a premium for some of their games.

2328
02:57:40,457 --> 02:57:42,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy Tactics, $17.99.

2329
02:57:42,937 --> 02:57:47,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Chaos Rings 2, just like you said, $19.99 on the iPad.

2330
02:57:47,859 --> 02:57:49,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll pass on that.

2331
02:57:49,539 --> 02:57:51,380
[SPEAKER_10]: You can get Imaginary Range for free.

2332
02:57:52,256 --> 02:58:09,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have my 3DS that can play some of those games just fine, and I'd rather do it on something like that than worrying about paying 18, 19 bucks on an app that when I'm in the middle of doing something, like you said, basically for Mass Effect 3, it's going to crash upon me.

2333
02:58:10,109 --> 02:58:10,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I pass on that.

2334
02:58:13,371 --> 02:58:17,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so it's absolutely 100% bulletproof and it's not going to crash or anything?

2335
02:58:17,732 --> 02:58:20,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, but even then, that's a considerable amount of money.

2336
02:58:20,893 --> 02:58:22,013
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big chunk.

2337
02:58:24,214 --> 02:58:30,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since I have most of those games anyways, and if everyone gets the same thing, I really don't feel like paying $15, $18 for it again.

2338
02:58:31,015 --> 02:58:31,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, so...

2339
02:58:34,884 --> 02:58:46,509
[SPEAKER_01]: And also about these shootings, and, you know, they always, you know, every time when some of this happens, you know, they're always blaming the media somehow, whether it be video games, movies, you know, music.

2340
02:58:46,850 --> 02:58:47,530
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's kind of weird.

2341
02:58:47,550 --> 02:58:48,630
[SPEAKER_01]: They never mention books.

2342
02:58:48,890 --> 02:58:50,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what kind of books was a person reading?

2343
02:58:50,851 --> 02:58:54,933
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of reading was a person doing to get to maybe even this frame of mind?

2344
02:58:54,953 --> 02:58:57,614
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because books are just as dangerous as anything else.

2345
02:58:58,255 --> 02:59:00,876
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no moving objects or anything within books.

2346
02:59:01,016 --> 02:59:01,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

2347
02:59:01,417 --> 02:59:02,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people still blame books.

2348
02:59:02,919 --> 02:59:09,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, granted, I'm getting a little historical here, but Fahrenheit 451 was a book, ironically, that was kind of all about that.

2349
02:59:09,547 --> 02:59:13,953
[SPEAKER_10]: And we still have in this day and age people that try to ban books from the public library.

2350
02:59:14,714 --> 02:59:18,438
[SPEAKER_10]: What, Catcher in the Rye always comes up on that list because it's smut.

2351
02:59:19,179 --> 02:59:22,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Harry Potter, no, but... Yeah, absolutely.

2352
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:26,762
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, what we need to do, too, is also look at the good stories.

2353
02:59:26,802 --> 02:59:28,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the things that are done, you know.

2354
02:59:28,483 --> 02:59:31,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody saved, you know, a family or something from a building building, you know.

2355
02:59:31,845 --> 02:59:35,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe try to twist out, you know, not really twist it around a little bit.

2356
02:59:35,906 --> 02:59:37,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe try to see if that person is a gamer.

2357
02:59:37,727 --> 02:59:39,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, hey, look, this person was a gamer.

2358
02:59:39,448 --> 02:59:41,269
[SPEAKER_01]: This person just saved a family, you know.

2359
02:59:41,349 --> 02:59:41,489
[SPEAKER_01]: He...

2360
02:59:42,430 --> 02:59:47,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because these people are gamers doesn't mean, oh, I like Halo and Warcraft.

2361
02:59:47,176 --> 02:59:55,086
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go around decapitating people, shooting people in the head because I'm seeing this in the game and I'm going, okay, I think this is okay.

2362
02:59:56,107 --> 02:59:57,329
[SPEAKER_10]: What about all the good things, gamer?

2363
02:59:57,349 --> 02:59:58,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that lyric when he goes

2364
03:00:27,472 --> 03:00:54,783
[SPEAKER_01]: they blame it on Maryland and the heroine where was the heroine and look where it's at and you know it's kind of funny because those little things it's kind of like looking for that little niche looking for that little thing to to basically saying you know if these weren't here this was you know this would have you know would never happen in the first place though it would and it's unfortunate too because it you know happened in such a closed area but you know like I you know like you said before

2365
03:00:55,903 --> 03:00:59,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after seeing these stories, stuff happens, I'm still going to go to libraries.

2366
03:00:59,345 --> 03:01:01,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going to go to grocery stores.

2367
03:01:01,226 --> 03:01:03,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going to go to the movie theater to watch my movies.

2368
03:01:05,209 --> 03:01:08,210
[SPEAKER_01]: We should let these little things affect our everyday life.

2369
03:01:08,471 --> 03:01:13,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't, then congratulations, they win.

2370
03:01:13,794 --> 03:01:14,834
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that simple.

2371
03:01:15,515 --> 03:01:16,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Very well said.

2372
03:01:16,455 --> 03:01:16,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

2373
03:01:17,096 --> 03:01:17,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

2374
03:01:17,436 --> 03:01:18,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to let you go to get some more calls.

2375
03:01:18,977 --> 03:01:19,757
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks for the call.

2376
03:01:19,777 --> 03:01:20,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, buddy?

2377
03:01:20,698 --> 03:01:21,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

2378
03:01:21,118 --> 03:01:21,378
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2379
03:01:21,418 --> 03:01:21,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, buddy.

2380
03:01:21,979 --> 03:01:22,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime.

2381
03:01:23,639 --> 03:01:27,241
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2382
03:01:27,721 --> 03:01:28,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead and give us a call.

2383
03:01:29,682 --> 03:01:31,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2384
03:01:32,044 --> 03:01:33,404
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have a couple of the tweets here.

2385
03:01:33,624 --> 03:01:39,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to comment one more time on the Games Planet Lab thing because that's kind of vague on what exactly they do different than...

2386
03:01:41,788 --> 03:01:42,428
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kickstarter.

2387
03:01:42,468 --> 03:01:46,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they actually have 10 commitments that they're going to make.

2388
03:01:46,750 --> 03:02:06,958
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, you know, a quality label designed with gamers, DRM, the gamers experience before all, secure payments, respective IP, clear timetable, a guarantee for delivery rewards, virtuous funding solutions, real selection work, project holder identity, and clear information.

2389
03:02:06,998 --> 03:02:09,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically just kind of providing more information, more...

2390
03:02:11,541 --> 03:02:12,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Commitments.

2391
03:02:12,863 --> 03:02:14,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go to the phone.

2392
03:02:15,026 --> 03:02:15,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me go to the phones.

2393
03:02:16,028 --> 03:02:16,669
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another call.

2394
03:02:16,749 --> 03:02:18,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2395
03:02:18,051 --> 03:02:18,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2396
03:02:19,193 --> 03:02:19,894
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Osfer.

2397
03:02:20,114 --> 03:02:20,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Osfer.

2398
03:02:20,835 --> 03:02:21,196
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2399
03:02:22,702 --> 03:02:25,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy that I resisted the newel, as Bobby would call it.

2400
03:02:26,765 --> 03:02:41,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, but you ended up winning a Steam code, though, so... Yeah, I mean, it's good that I won that, but, like, all my friends are like, oh, I have no money, and now I've been, like, using all my wallet funding on these Steam sales, and I'm just like, I only bought one game, and that game wasn't even for me.

2401
03:02:42,258 --> 03:02:44,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I bought Mass Effect 1 for a friend.

2402
03:02:45,261 --> 03:02:45,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there you go.

2403
03:02:46,202 --> 03:02:48,323
[SPEAKER_10]: So have you been tempted by any of the Steam sales?

2404
03:02:49,705 --> 03:02:49,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

2405
03:02:51,129 --> 03:02:51,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

2406
03:02:51,889 --> 03:02:52,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just sort of looking at games.

2407
03:02:55,111 --> 03:02:55,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry?

2408
03:02:55,531 --> 03:02:55,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Say that again?

2409
03:02:55,952 --> 03:02:58,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

2410
03:02:58,493 --> 03:02:58,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

2411
03:02:58,853 --> 03:02:59,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we lose him?

2412
03:02:59,633 --> 03:03:00,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we lost him.

2413
03:03:00,474 --> 03:03:01,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't hear you, buddy.

2414
03:03:01,935 --> 03:03:02,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Plug the mic back in.

2415
03:03:03,936 --> 03:03:04,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

2416
03:03:04,676 --> 03:03:07,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it says internet connection problem between us.

2417
03:03:07,938 --> 03:03:08,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just dropped.

2418
03:03:09,118 --> 03:03:09,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we drop?

2419
03:03:10,199 --> 03:03:10,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2420
03:03:12,040 --> 03:03:12,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh...

2421
03:03:13,576 --> 03:03:13,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh.

2422
03:03:14,016 --> 03:03:14,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2423
03:03:14,617 --> 03:03:14,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2424
03:03:16,178 --> 03:03:16,838
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, don't take that.

2425
03:03:16,918 --> 03:03:17,259
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

2426
03:03:17,499 --> 03:03:17,899
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

2427
03:03:17,999 --> 03:03:18,219
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back.

2428
03:03:18,239 --> 03:03:18,679
[SPEAKER_10]: No, don't, don't.

2429
03:03:19,060 --> 03:03:22,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a hiccup because we are still... Oh, good.

2430
03:03:22,422 --> 03:03:23,182
[SPEAKER_10]: He called right back.

2431
03:03:24,223 --> 03:03:25,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We probably lost all the listeners.

2432
03:03:25,724 --> 03:03:26,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

2433
03:03:26,104 --> 03:03:27,385
[SPEAKER_10]: There went the feed.

2434
03:03:27,565 --> 03:03:28,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, it'll come back.

2435
03:03:28,626 --> 03:03:29,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you still there?

2436
03:03:29,226 --> 03:03:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me?

2437
03:03:29,967 --> 03:03:30,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can hear you.

2438
03:03:31,028 --> 03:03:31,588
[SPEAKER_10]: We're taping.

2439
03:03:32,148 --> 03:03:34,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead and keep going with your question for the podcasties.

2440
03:03:34,750 --> 03:03:37,992
[SPEAKER_10]: We're offline right now, but the podcasters are still hearing this.

2441
03:03:38,032 --> 03:03:38,172
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

2442
03:03:39,233 --> 03:03:43,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I had asked you if there was anything that you were wanting off of Steam.

2443
03:03:44,415 --> 03:03:44,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

2444
03:03:45,195 --> 03:03:50,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was, like, looking at, um... I'm tempted by Amnesia and Alan Wake.

2445
03:03:50,158 --> 03:03:53,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, Alan Wake won because I heard it's kind of Silent Hill-y.

2446
03:03:53,859 --> 03:03:55,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I might like that.

2447
03:03:55,280 --> 03:04:00,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And Amnesia actually did... I watched a group play through it, and I played, like, a little part of it myself.

2448
03:04:01,342 --> 03:04:03,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But, like, there are some bits and pieces I missed, so...

2449
03:04:04,119 --> 03:04:06,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I should really get the full game, but I don't know.

2450
03:04:07,021 --> 03:04:08,342
[SPEAKER_05]: That game made me terrified at some point.

2451
03:04:08,502 --> 03:04:16,028
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a video of me playing through it at one point, and I'm just screaming when I do something blatantly obvious that hurts me.

2452
03:04:16,628 --> 03:04:17,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2453
03:04:17,289 --> 03:04:17,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great game.

2454
03:04:17,829 --> 03:04:20,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, you're saying there's this video like it's out there on YouTube?

2455
03:04:21,051 --> 03:04:21,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2456
03:04:21,952 --> 03:04:22,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you need to give me the link.

2457
03:04:25,054 --> 03:04:25,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here.

2458
03:04:26,415 --> 03:04:27,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a video of like...

2459
03:04:28,050 --> 03:04:30,311
[SPEAKER_05]: A bunch of people in my group down at college.

2460
03:04:30,352 --> 03:04:32,853
[SPEAKER_05]: We all get together and we play games late at night.

2461
03:04:33,153 --> 03:04:34,494
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was one of them.

2462
03:04:36,035 --> 03:04:37,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just has all the screams.

2463
03:04:37,376 --> 03:04:40,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And you film your antics and put them up on YouTube for your adoring public?

2464
03:04:41,418 --> 03:04:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't me.

2465
03:04:42,239 --> 03:04:44,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it was the guy who was in our group.

2466
03:04:44,620 --> 03:04:45,941
[SPEAKER_05]: He brings in his desktop.

2467
03:04:45,961 --> 03:04:49,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't even know this, but he has a microphone sitting behind the desk that we're playing at.

2468
03:04:49,724 --> 03:04:51,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's just recording everything.

2469
03:04:52,045 --> 03:04:54,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he takes the scream and then he slows it down.

2470
03:04:54,847 --> 03:04:56,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty hilarious.

2471
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:05,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well while you're looking for that link for me, is there anything else you want to call in to discuss tonight?

2472
03:05:07,162 --> 03:05:18,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else other than the fact that I might regret getting my friend Mass Effect because if he gets really into it, then he'll eventually get to Mass Effect 3 and then I'll be like, oh, I want to play with you online.

2473
03:05:18,585 --> 03:05:20,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I have to get the PC version now too.

2474
03:05:21,066 --> 03:05:21,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap.

2475
03:05:22,082 --> 03:05:23,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look at it this way.

2476
03:05:23,483 --> 03:05:24,824
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll never be able to connect.

2477
03:05:25,045 --> 03:05:26,646
[SPEAKER_10]: So just, you know, don't get your hopes up.

2478
03:05:27,207 --> 03:05:28,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's true.

2479
03:05:28,748 --> 03:05:29,148
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2480
03:05:29,609 --> 03:05:30,209
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, buddy.

2481
03:05:30,309 --> 03:05:30,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

2482
03:05:31,430 --> 03:05:32,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy that beta.

2483
03:05:32,892 --> 03:05:33,192
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2484
03:05:33,272 --> 03:05:34,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for it.

2485
03:05:34,153 --> 03:05:34,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, no problem.

2486
03:05:34,733 --> 03:05:35,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank Boshka.

2487
03:05:35,514 --> 03:05:35,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care.

2488
03:05:36,615 --> 03:05:36,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2489
03:05:36,975 --> 03:05:37,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

2490
03:05:37,856 --> 03:05:38,216
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2491
03:05:38,236 --> 03:05:43,361
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2492
03:05:43,861 --> 03:05:48,605
[SPEAKER_10]: While I still wait for that link for the video of...

2493
03:05:50,626 --> 03:06:05,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Osfer screaming at the amnesia because I think amnesia reaction videos are really funny I love the one that Alan put on my wall on Facebook of the guy playing through amnesia where it just starts and like the first door opens he's like lol nope and quits it's like a 10 second video

2494
03:06:06,733 --> 03:06:09,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to the phones again and hope the phone doesn't drop during the call.

2495
03:06:09,715 --> 03:06:11,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2496
03:06:11,095 --> 03:06:11,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2497
03:06:11,936 --> 03:06:15,277
[SPEAKER_08]: You're such a hater about the Mass Effect 3 PC game.

2498
03:06:15,377 --> 03:06:16,638
[SPEAKER_10]: It pisses me off.

2499
03:06:16,818 --> 03:06:18,079
[SPEAKER_10]: How can you not be mad?

2500
03:06:18,579 --> 03:06:21,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the Xbox does the same exact thing.

2501
03:06:21,621 --> 03:06:24,302
[SPEAKER_10]: But you haven't, no, Xbox hasn't robbed me of credits yet.

2502
03:06:24,781 --> 03:06:25,522
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

2503
03:06:25,662 --> 03:06:31,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It robbed you of playing it on PC, and that's a far worse offense.

2504
03:06:31,545 --> 03:06:33,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely you didn't just call to complain.

2505
03:06:33,407 --> 03:06:34,387
[SPEAKER_08]: What else did you call about?

2506
03:06:35,568 --> 03:06:37,589
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, I was all complaining.

2507
03:06:38,630 --> 03:06:41,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm mad you didn't play Jack Levin's theme.

2508
03:06:41,792 --> 03:06:45,316
[SPEAKER_08]: during that F-Zero break when it's clearly the best song in the game.

2509
03:06:45,456 --> 03:06:49,600
[SPEAKER_10]: The folks listening on the podcast don't even know that we played F-Zero music during the break.

2510
03:06:49,660 --> 03:06:50,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

2511
03:06:50,741 --> 03:06:51,582
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not special.

2512
03:06:52,924 --> 03:06:54,505
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't get to hear F-Zero music.

2513
03:06:54,545 --> 03:06:56,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Views and opinions of Shane or Shane's.

2514
03:06:57,088 --> 03:06:57,368
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2515
03:06:57,749 --> 03:06:58,389
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just saying.

2516
03:07:00,311 --> 03:07:00,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

2517
03:07:00,752 --> 03:07:02,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Making sure the podcast listeners know you're a jerk.

2518
03:07:03,595 --> 03:07:04,196
[SPEAKER_08]: There, you know that.

2519
03:07:05,917 --> 03:07:15,343
[SPEAKER_08]: and now I have to go find my copy of F-Zero because I may need to play it even though my flipping people off finger is so badly hurt right now.

2520
03:07:15,724 --> 03:07:17,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you cut your finger before the show.

2521
03:07:18,025 --> 03:07:18,606
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not good.

2522
03:07:18,626 --> 03:07:20,727
[SPEAKER_10]: You were posting pictures on Facebook and they're really gross.

2523
03:07:20,787 --> 03:07:21,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do people do that?

2524
03:07:22,228 --> 03:07:24,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need to see your wounds all over Facebook.

2525
03:07:24,949 --> 03:07:27,930
[SPEAKER_08]: My finger is kind of like the current model 3DS.

2526
03:07:27,970 --> 03:07:29,290
[SPEAKER_08]: It has three different layers now.

2527
03:07:29,350 --> 03:07:36,792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the fingernail and then the finger and then the huge flap that's left over where my finger got cut.

2528
03:07:36,832 --> 03:07:37,953
[SPEAKER_08]: You're disgusting.

2529
03:07:39,913 --> 03:07:40,193
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2530
03:07:40,273 --> 03:07:42,814
[SPEAKER_10]: The picture you posted of your dog was much better.

2531
03:07:43,955 --> 03:07:45,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he was tuckered out from all the blood.

2532
03:07:45,975 --> 03:07:48,736
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, look, did you have anything else you wanted to talk about tonight?

2533
03:07:50,375 --> 03:07:51,796
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, not really.

2534
03:07:52,616 --> 03:07:53,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to complain.

2535
03:07:53,857 --> 03:07:54,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of bored.

2536
03:07:54,818 --> 03:07:56,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'm going to let you go, hater.

2537
03:07:56,859 --> 03:07:58,679
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not if I do it first.

2538
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:01,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And he hung up.

2539
03:08:01,441 --> 03:08:01,921
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2540
03:08:02,641 --> 03:08:04,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Shane, I think.

2541
03:08:05,203 --> 03:08:05,443
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2542
03:08:05,723 --> 03:08:11,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let me... I want to go to one other... Okay, this is the YouTube that Ossifer was... Oh, this is a six-minute long video.

2543
03:08:11,606 --> 03:08:11,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, good.

2544
03:08:11,986 --> 03:08:13,147
[SPEAKER_10]: He linked me right to the right part.

2545
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:15,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Ossifer.

2546
03:08:18,433 --> 03:08:18,914
[SPEAKER_10]: It's loading.

2547
03:08:18,934 --> 03:08:20,135
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to wait for that to load.

2548
03:08:20,516 --> 03:08:21,076
[SPEAKER_10]: It's buffering.

2549
03:08:21,677 --> 03:08:22,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, we'll take one more call.

2550
03:08:22,918 --> 03:08:23,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2551
03:08:23,880 --> 03:08:24,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

2552
03:08:25,121 --> 03:08:25,622
[SPEAKER_04]: What up, guys?

2553
03:08:25,642 --> 03:08:27,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Xenocore from the OKC.

2554
03:08:27,043 --> 03:08:27,784
[SPEAKER_04]: How you guys doing?

2555
03:08:27,804 --> 03:08:28,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I'm good.

2556
03:08:28,665 --> 03:08:29,586
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Xenocore?

2557
03:08:29,606 --> 03:08:31,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, no, staying employed.

2558
03:08:32,710 --> 03:08:34,052
[SPEAKER_10]: In this economy, that's a hard thing to do.

2559
03:08:34,887 --> 03:08:35,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

2560
03:08:36,949 --> 03:08:41,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I've been playing a hell of a lot of the Streets of Rage V5 remake that got pushed out.

2561
03:08:42,034 --> 03:08:42,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

2562
03:08:42,734 --> 03:08:44,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Did Sega succeed in getting that pulled?

2563
03:08:46,297 --> 03:08:47,919
[SPEAKER_04]: It already escaped to the internet.

2564
03:08:48,019 --> 03:08:48,980
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no stopping it.

2565
03:08:49,280 --> 03:08:49,801
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2566
03:08:50,101 --> 03:08:53,404
[SPEAKER_04]: They may kill their own personal link, but it's out in the wilds now.

2567
03:08:54,445 --> 03:08:55,285
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very true.

2568
03:08:55,866 --> 03:08:58,528
[SPEAKER_10]: So what made you decide to play this remake?

2569
03:08:58,548 --> 03:09:00,230
[SPEAKER_10]: You just love Streets of Rage?

2570
03:09:00,848 --> 03:09:03,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, they did rearrangement of Yu Suzuki's music.

2571
03:09:03,611 --> 03:09:05,513
[SPEAKER_04]: What version do you need?

2572
03:09:06,414 --> 03:09:08,155
[SPEAKER_04]: You thought F-Zero's music was good.

2573
03:09:08,176 --> 03:09:11,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You put that stuff on with real instruments and everything behind it.

2574
03:09:11,139 --> 03:09:11,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

2575
03:09:11,679 --> 03:09:13,601
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to put it up in the club and just play all night.

2576
03:09:15,443 --> 03:09:17,705
[SPEAKER_10]: So the soundtrack alone is worth checking it out for.

2577
03:09:17,745 --> 03:09:18,206
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

2578
03:09:18,746 --> 03:09:19,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I ripped the whole thing.

2579
03:09:19,867 --> 03:09:22,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already on my phone so I can listen to it in my car when I'm driving.

2580
03:09:23,171 --> 03:09:23,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

2581
03:09:23,852 --> 03:09:24,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2582
03:09:25,031 --> 03:09:26,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's actually a pretty faithful remake.

2583
03:09:28,572 --> 03:09:30,932
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all pixelated and everything, even if you make it full screen.

2584
03:09:31,332 --> 03:09:34,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like playing on MAME or something else like that, but it's all custom.

2585
03:09:35,453 --> 03:09:36,673
[SPEAKER_04]: It did quite a good job with it.

2586
03:09:39,233 --> 03:09:45,574
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I understand why Sega might want to squash it, because it's almost a better version of what they've been putting out for their games.

2587
03:09:45,915 --> 03:09:48,555
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better than what they do to Sonic in some ways.

2588
03:09:48,575 --> 03:09:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2589
03:09:49,115 --> 03:09:49,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably.

2590
03:09:49,675 --> 03:09:50,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I could see that.

2591
03:09:50,615 --> 03:09:51,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that.

2592
03:09:52,436 --> 03:09:54,276
[SPEAKER_10]: So, what else is on your mind this week?

2593
03:09:55,800 --> 03:09:57,362
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

2594
03:09:57,402 --> 03:10:03,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Steam's taking care of everything, but they still can't lure me to Skyrim until I get a game of the year version so I can get all the DLC at once for one price.

2595
03:10:04,010 --> 03:10:04,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

2596
03:10:04,751 --> 03:10:06,714
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no DLC on PC yet.

2597
03:10:07,034 --> 03:10:09,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the Vampire DLC comes out when?

2598
03:10:10,038 --> 03:10:11,080
[SPEAKER_10]: It's got to be really soon, right?

2599
03:10:11,943 --> 03:10:14,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but sooner or later it will.

2600
03:10:14,444 --> 03:10:22,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did pick up the Arkham City DLC for $3, so I played my two hours of that and was like, ah, okay.

2601
03:10:23,769 --> 03:10:24,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

2602
03:10:25,089 --> 03:10:27,891
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a big thing that was on sale during the week, too.

2603
03:10:27,951 --> 03:10:28,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot about that.

2604
03:10:29,171 --> 03:10:31,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, almost all the DLC has their own little mini sales.

2605
03:10:31,853 --> 03:10:35,415
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to go into the game to see them if they're not currently running on the front page.

2606
03:10:36,875 --> 03:10:38,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So y'all got, like, what?

2607
03:10:39,253 --> 03:10:45,236
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 minutes, one and a half hours to go and check out all the DLC that you want so you can get it at a worthwhile price.

2608
03:10:45,536 --> 03:10:45,896
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2609
03:10:45,916 --> 03:10:46,936
[SPEAKER_10]: You better hurry, everybody.

2610
03:10:48,357 --> 03:10:49,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I had.

2611
03:10:49,357 --> 03:10:49,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Good show, guys.

2612
03:10:49,937 --> 03:10:50,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it up.

2613
03:10:50,398 --> 03:10:50,638
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2614
03:10:50,678 --> 03:10:51,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Xenocore.

2615
03:10:51,298 --> 03:10:51,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it, buddy.

2616
03:10:51,938 --> 03:10:52,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one, okay?

2617
03:10:53,219 --> 03:10:53,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2618
03:10:53,679 --> 03:10:53,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2619
03:10:55,080 --> 03:10:57,322
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's about, sadly, all the calls we can take tonight.

2620
03:10:57,362 --> 03:10:58,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very sorry we didn't get to everybody.

2621
03:10:58,722 --> 03:11:00,163
[SPEAKER_10]: The phones were actually blowing up tonight.

2622
03:11:00,263 --> 03:11:02,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm loving the participation, though, you guys.

2623
03:11:02,105 --> 03:11:03,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for emailing.

2624
03:11:03,586 --> 03:11:04,326
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for calling.

2625
03:11:04,366 --> 03:11:09,069
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry we couldn't get everybody, but be sure to, like, you know, send us more emails.

2626
03:11:09,229 --> 03:11:11,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Participate on the forums at vognetwork.com.

2627
03:11:12,071 --> 03:11:13,052
[SPEAKER_10]: You can also tweet us.

2628
03:11:13,132 --> 03:11:14,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I will do one more tweet here.

2629
03:11:14,393 --> 03:11:15,593
[SPEAKER_10]: That video won't load.

2630
03:11:15,613 --> 03:11:16,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to try after the show.

2631
03:11:16,974 --> 03:11:19,636
[SPEAKER_10]: It must be just our internet connection is kind of jank tonight, I guess.

2632
03:11:20,196 --> 03:11:20,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

2633
03:11:23,041 --> 03:11:25,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let me read this real quick.

2634
03:11:25,664 --> 03:11:28,167
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a link from Tigerclaw, and I love this story.

2635
03:11:29,569 --> 03:11:36,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft had to apologize because a programmer hid the phrase, big boobs in company software.

2636
03:11:38,672 --> 03:11:39,393
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

2637
03:11:53,752 --> 03:12:01,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, apparently there's a string in the hexadecimal computer language that says, in hexadecimal, Big Boobs, if you can figure out how to read it.

2638
03:12:02,315 --> 03:12:12,259
[SPEAKER_10]: The code was spotted by programmers and caused controversy within the community because, of course, they want to distance themselves from being just an all-male pig-headed club.

2639
03:12:12,679 --> 03:12:13,479
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

2640
03:12:13,519 --> 03:12:16,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Big Boobs is harmless.

2641
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:16,580
[SPEAKER_10]: That's funny.

2642
03:12:16,760 --> 03:12:17,560
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2643
03:12:17,580 --> 03:12:18,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Big Boobs is funny.

2644
03:12:19,541 --> 03:12:21,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Even women like boobs, right?

2645
03:12:22,145 --> 03:12:22,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2646
03:12:22,586 --> 03:12:24,629
[SPEAKER_10]: If Jamie were here, she would say yes, trust me.

2647
03:12:26,031 --> 03:12:28,174
[SPEAKER_10]: But they say, oh, it's childish humor.

2648
03:12:29,716 --> 03:12:30,517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just boobs.

2649
03:12:31,479 --> 03:12:32,240
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just boobs.

2650
03:12:34,156 --> 03:12:35,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's all I have for the tweets.

2651
03:12:36,319 --> 03:12:38,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, do you have any other last minute stories you want to read?

2652
03:12:38,021 --> 03:12:39,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just one thing.

2653
03:12:39,222 --> 03:12:43,527
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new Operation, because you know there's Operation Rainfall.

2654
03:12:43,928 --> 03:12:54,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So now there's Operation Zero, which is trying to convince Nintendo of US to bring Fatal Frame 2, the Wii edition, to the US.

2655
03:12:56,400 --> 03:13:00,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've got a Facebook page you can go check out.

2656
03:13:01,165 --> 03:13:09,993
[SPEAKER_02]: So just search for Operation-0 and they're going to have a letter writing campaign starting this week, July 25th through the 27th.

2657
03:13:11,715 --> 03:13:12,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck with that.

2658
03:13:13,716 --> 03:13:15,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally got Osfer's video to load.

2659
03:13:27,672 --> 03:13:34,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Did that scream really come out of the same guy who called us a minute ago?

2660
03:13:51,862 --> 03:13:53,684
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I haven't installed that game yet.

2661
03:13:53,804 --> 03:13:54,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that game.

2662
03:13:55,025 --> 03:13:58,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have it too, but I'm afraid if I play it, Alan will be there with a camera.

2663
03:13:58,909 --> 03:13:59,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see you making that noise.

2664
03:13:59,930 --> 03:14:01,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to make that same noise.

2665
03:14:01,291 --> 03:14:02,653
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I'm not going to play it.

2666
03:14:07,446 --> 03:14:09,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so that's it for Last Minute Stories.

2667
03:14:10,107 --> 03:14:10,447
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2668
03:14:10,507 --> 03:14:13,648
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it for Twitter topics and that means that is it for the show.

2669
03:14:13,728 --> 03:14:17,750
[SPEAKER_10]: We are about on out of here but not before we get everybody's final thought.

2670
03:14:18,450 --> 03:14:21,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Alan, thank you so much for sitting in on the show tonight in place of DarkSakura.

2671
03:14:21,952 --> 03:14:22,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

2672
03:14:22,732 --> 03:14:23,572
[SPEAKER_10]: A pleasure as always.

2673
03:14:23,652 --> 03:14:25,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job and thanks for your insight.

2674
03:14:25,693 --> 03:14:26,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

2675
03:14:27,434 --> 03:14:28,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully we'll see you again.

2676
03:14:28,334 --> 03:14:28,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be a stranger.

2677
03:14:28,994 --> 03:14:33,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully you'll have more Sunday nights off in the future if your boss is listening.

2678
03:14:33,556 --> 03:14:34,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

2679
03:14:34,957 --> 03:14:35,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you like making the money too.

2680
03:14:36,808 --> 03:14:38,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any final thoughts for listeners?

2681
03:14:39,089 --> 03:14:41,450
[SPEAKER_10]: Hamburger Helper helps your hamburger make a great meal.

2682
03:14:43,051 --> 03:14:43,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2683
03:14:43,571 --> 03:14:44,211
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very deep.

2684
03:14:44,571 --> 03:14:45,292
[SPEAKER_10]: It's insightful.

2685
03:14:47,192 --> 03:14:48,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2686
03:14:49,033 --> 03:14:56,536
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is next week on Saturday I want to play some serious Call of Duty.

2687
03:14:58,797 --> 03:15:03,519
[SPEAKER_02]: And the week from that, or week from Wednesday, I want to play some serious Ritter Player One.

2688
03:15:04,369 --> 03:15:05,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff on the line.

2689
03:15:06,014 --> 03:15:06,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

2690
03:15:06,615 --> 03:15:07,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

2691
03:15:07,036 --> 03:15:07,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Win a DeLorean.

2692
03:15:07,818 --> 03:15:08,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Win a DeLorean.

2693
03:15:09,102 --> 03:15:09,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it.

2694
03:15:10,004 --> 03:15:12,531
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought tonight is Nutter Butter.

2695
03:15:14,144 --> 03:15:14,724
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's it.

2696
