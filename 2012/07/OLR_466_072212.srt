00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Tonight, July 22, 2012, has a hugely anticipated title being cancelled, Microsoft secretly

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:31,600
steps up security and Steam heads to another platform.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,700
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,820
Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,200
It is episode number 466 for this July the 22nd of 2012.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
We're here to talk about video games and the gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle with you

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,600
guys who are participating live at the VOG Network, live.vognetwork.com to get in the

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
chat room and chat with us.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,360
And of course, we want to acknowledge the folks listening along in the podcast form

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
as well.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,340
I know a lot of us listen to us on their Mondays to help get through the work day or throughout

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,480
the week or what have you.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,900
So thanks for tuning in and thanks for participating in the not-live format.

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,840
We just are very happy to have you all here.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,880
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,120
DarkSakra, not here tonight.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,880
She is in Las Vegas.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,920
I'll come back to that in just a minute, tell you a little more about that.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,360
But joining us tonight here in studio, we do have Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Hi.

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
How are you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm doing good.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
You are playing a game over there that you're giggling like crazy over.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
What is this?

25
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
I want to be the guy Gaiden.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Oh dear.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Oh dear.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,160
I remember I Want to Be the Guy was one of those like impossible games, right?

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,960
I just like the look of it now because it's all 16-bit-ish now and it's, you got a lot

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
of homages.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,480
Well, obviously the first one had a lot of homages to stuff, but I mean the first level

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,840
is it's bionic panda, so I mean it's pretty awesome.

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,080
What is the appeal of these games that are just impossible to beat?

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,400
Is it the whole- It's not impossible.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,800
They're just really hard.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Next to impossible.

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Well, here's the thing.

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,920
I have a couple reasons why I'm playing.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,480
One because it's fun.

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,820
Well, it's hard, but it's still fun.

41
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:16,600
Two because I'm thinking one of two things is going to happen for the next gate challenge

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,680
for Ready Player One stuff.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,320
It's going to either be a game that's hard like this or it's going to be a text adventure

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,960
game.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,780
Be my guess.

46
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm not good at either one of those.

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,400
It's time to go back and study up on Zork.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Pretty much, yeah, because that was one of the challenges in the book was Zork.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,120
Oh, okay.

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,140
You are standing in front of a White House.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,160
There is a mailbox here.

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,920
What do you do?

54
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Open mailbox.

55
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,260
Take letter.

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,080
You better read up on your FAQs for the old school Zork games.

57
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,640
All right.

58
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,660
Well, also joining us here, since Star Soccer is not here, we like to invite other people

59
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,000
to come on and host, and we have our old favorite standby host who doesn't have a choice because

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
he lives here.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Say hello to Allen.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hello.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How are you, Allen?

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm great.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Awesome.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,300
Thanks for coming back tonight.

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
You're welcome.

68
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
What's new with you?

69
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,080
You're like, I asked a bunch of people, I can't get a guest host.

70
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,720
You have to do it.

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,840
And I was like, oh, so I'm like sixth choice.

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,840
That's great to hear.

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,880
I asked one other person and then I was too lazy to ask anyone else.

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,080
So I just, you know, tap, tap, tap.

75
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,440
And the other person I asked was Flaco Jones, who, you know, to be fair, was here that night.

76
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
He's bad luck.

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
He's me.

78
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
He makes power go out.

79
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
Yeah, it's true.

80
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Maybe it's best you stay away.

81
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm kidding.

82
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm kidding.

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,440
I'm kidding.

84
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
But he has like babies and things.

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Yeah.

86
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,680
When you have babies and things that, you know, priorities and all this stuff.

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,080
I understand.

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,680
Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show at live.voggenetwork.com.

89
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
Act Def starts us off tonight.

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,840
Allen, the host without a choice.

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,760
All right.

92
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,800
Well, Dark Sakura isn't here tonight.

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,480
She's in Las Vegas and she's at a wedding.

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,780
She is at the wedding of Tiara and Dan.

95
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,560
And you may or may not recognize those names.

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Tiara is somebody, she's been on OLR before, but not like in a really long time, but she

97
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,800
came up here to Sacramento because Tiara and Jamie have been friends for a very long time.

98
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:28,160
But Tiara and Dan are both two of the big writers at the site Geek Life or geek-life.com.

99
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,940
And we've done a lot of stuff with them over the years.

100
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,640
They've been really wonderful in promoting us and we've tried to promote them where we

101
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,960
can.

102
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,640
They got married today, geek-life.com.

103
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,700
A geek wedding happened today in Las Vegas.

104
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,800
And of course, since Jamie and Tiara go way back, she flew down there for the wedding.

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
So I think that's great.

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
What geek theme do they have for the wedding?

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,000
I know they had like a giant doctor who doctor who everything.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
It's like they had like a giant doctor who TARDIS cardboard thing.

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,480
And the cake topper is them.

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Yes.

112
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Yeah.

113
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,400
Is it might be Amy and what's his name?

114
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,840
I think they're, yeah, it's kind of like, he's got red hair and TRS got red hair.

115
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
Exactly.

116
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
He's got his doctor who characters.

117
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,400
Well, you can read more about it at geek-life.com because Tiara does a series called Bride and

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,200
the Geek or is it Beauty and the Geek?

119
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,680
Now I sound like a terrible person because I don't know the name.

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,120
I think it's Beauty and the Geek, actually, but it's about them setting up and planning

121
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
their wedding.

122
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,800
And I thought it was a really cute series, even if the name escapes me right now, because

123
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm under pressure.

124
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,120
But Dark Sakura will be back next week.

125
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,520
But we can certainly understand she wanted to go to the bachelorette party, which looked

126
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,560
like it was last night.

127
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,040
And I think they checked into a chocolate place.

128
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,520
So you know, with girls, if they're not going to go see the stripper thing and do that,

129
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
what do girls love more than strippers?

130
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Chocolate.

131
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,920
So it makes sense that they would go to a chocolate place of which I guess there is

132
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,360
one in Vegas.

133
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Let's see.

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Immortal King in our chat room says Dark Sakura too busy dodging the bouquet.

135
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
You know, Dark Sakura is married.

136
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,040
She's talked about her husband, Dan, several times on the show.

137
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,920
I believe that makes you ineligible to even go out to the floor when they ask where the

138
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,760
single ladies put your hands up, you know, so Dark Sakura would not qualify to catch

139
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,320
the bouquet.

140
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,300
I will point out that I did catch the garter at a wedding a couple of years ago.

141
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
That was when Mel and Mel got married.

142
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,960
I caught the garter.

143
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,120
So still waiting.

144
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,000
That's all right, I've caught the garter before too.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,040
All right, um, let's see, uh, also in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, um, Tiger

146
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Claw says, what Sky is trying to say is tonight's show is a sausage fest, maybe, but we will

147
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,840
open it up to callers later on and maybe some lovely ladies will call in.

148
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,000
Cause I know we do have some gals that listen to OLR or maybe we'll get some emails or some

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,320
tweets from all genders later on.

150
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
So we'll find out.

151
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,400
We'll probably just get Jim Sally.

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,080
Jim Sally does have a baby girl.

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Maybe, maybe she'll get on the line and say, or something, whatever babies say.

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
All right.

155
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Anyhow.

156
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,400
Um, we always like to start off the show with a kickoff topic.

157
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't have anything too serious tonight, but I do have one thing that has been dominating

158
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:24,180
the gaming world this week, especially if you're a PC gamer, steam sale.

159
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,180
That's right.

160
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,920
I want to talk about how has the steam sale damaged your life or your wallet steam sale

161
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
going on.

162
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,640
I believe it ends tomorrow.

163
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,400
I don't know if that means tomorrow at 10 AM and it's done or if that means there's

164
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,320
like one last final hurrah where everything goes on sale or something.

165
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
I don't know.

166
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,760
I got my meta achievement of voting on the community's choice every day, the sale.

167
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,000
So that means today's last day.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's that.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,720
Well, it says prices through the 23rd so I think today's sales are going to run through

170
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,600
like 2 PM tomorrow and then I think it's going to be over right then it's over from yesterday

171
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,920
that expired in eight hours from when I bought them earlier.

172
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,880
Um, so probably, yeah, through tomorrow.

173
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,720
So I wanted to go around and see how did the steam sale wreck your wallet this week?

174
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,600
Uh, Loki, how did the steam sale wreck your wallet?

175
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Well, before I had purchased Skyrim and Borderlands, um, actually it was pretty good this week.

176
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,280
I almost bought, um, Earth Defense Force, Instinct Armageddon, but then I remembered

177
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,840
how much I'd, it was a fun game, but it's not worth owning twice unlike, you know, Earth

178
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,160
Defense Force 2017, which I owned a lot of times.

179
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:46,280
Um, and then I bought Arma 2, uh, the, uh, the pack they had, it was with, uh, Arma 2

180
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,280
and the expansion for like 20 bucks.

181
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:58,920
So I got that, almost, I almost considered Sandrais, but I don't want to, um, so we'll

182
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
see.

183
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
Um, I think, I think that's all I was going to get.

184
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,520
I almost bought Orange Box, but once again, you know, I just don't see myself playing

185
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
through Half Life.

186
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,680
I know it's a good game, but I just, when I had the Orange Box, I played Portal and

187
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,120
that was pretty much it.

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,420
Although Team Fortress 2 I hear is good, but that's free, so I don't really need the Orange

189
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
Box for that.

190
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,680
Um, but yeah, so Arma 2 is only the new thing that I bought, but, uh, I'm looking forward

191
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,120
to checking out DayZ, which is that zombie, uh, thing that they've got.

192
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,840
It's supposed to be all sorts of craziness and boring at the same time.

193
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,200
Isn't the Orange Box have like every Half Life thing in it?

194
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,760
Yeah, it's Half Life, Half Life 2 Episode 1 and Episode 2 and, well, and then the original

195
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,200
game, and then, uh, Portal and Team Fortress 2, but I don't need to play through Portal

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,760
again because I've played through that a few times.

197
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm pretty sure Alan would tell you Half Life is the best thing you're gonna get.

198
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,620
It's really, I play Half Life 2 and the episodes like twice a year.

199
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,080
But they, the thing is with that is they mark this stuff down all the time, so it's not

200
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,160
like, ooh, I missed my only opportunity for this.

201
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,400
I mean, seriously, they mark this stuff down all the time and I'm sure if I go to a GameStop

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,200
or something like that, I'm sure they got a copy of the Orange Box on PC or even Half

203
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Life 2 just sitting there rotting that I could probably take off their hands for, you know,

204
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
nothing.

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,880
Let me ask a completely random, tangible question because we were talking about Half Life and,

206
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,200
you know, I know that it seems like Valve is trolling you with Half Life 3, right Alan?

207
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,560
Either Half Life 3 or Half Life 2 Episode 3, whatever they wanna do.

208
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,320
But it seems like nothing's ever gonna happen, right?

209
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,880
Yeah, it's now been longer from Half Life Episode 2 today to current day than it was

210
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,040
from Half Life 1 to Half Life 2.

211
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,080
Do you worry that if, you know, Half Life 3 ever does come out at some point that it's

212
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,480
gonna be like Diablo 3 and what I mean by that is, I think most people, not all, but

213
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,520
most people kinda consider Diablo 3 a letdown for a variety of reasons, be it that auction

214
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,440
house or the lack of, you know, offline play or something.

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,600
I think the only reason why there hasn't been Half Life 3 is because they need to develop

216
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
a new engine.

217
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,920
I mean, they've been using the Source engine forever now, so it's time that they come out

218
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,640
with a new engine.

219
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,360
But let me go back to the question for Alan, do you worry that Half Life 3 may end up being

220
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
a disappointment?

221
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,160
Well, it kinda reminds me, you know the series Lost and how weird it was and there was a,

222
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,960
some of the fans were like, they totally know how it's gonna end and the other half of the

223
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,920
fans were like, they're making this shit up as they go along.

224
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,800
Half Life, I'm afraid the story might get too big for them to reign in and the story

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,200
might be weird, but otherwise, I mean, it's just gonna be a first person shooter.

226
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,440
It's Valve, Valve's pedigree is very high, so I don't really expect them to drop the

227
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,760
ball that much on it.

228
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,440
Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com seems to agree with Loki.

229
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,040
I think Half Life 3 will come out if and only if they create a new engine for their games.

230
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,600
They need a Source 2.

231
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,360
I think they are gonna create a new engine for their game because it's getting dated.

232
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,320
But I mean, it's good, they make good games and the engine still looks pretty nice, but

233
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,840
it's just, they're gonna need to come out with something at some point.

234
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,000
I mean, it's gonna have to happen because it's gonna get dated.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,800
Yeah, because Source as it is, which it's the first generation of it was 2003 or 2004

236
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
when Half Life 2 came out, it's been updated four or five times.

237
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Yeah.

238
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,240
But it's still the core engine.

239
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
Is that what's running Portal 2?

240
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Yes.

241
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Wow.

242
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,280
Yes, it's a modified Source and Left 4 Dead 2 is also a modified Source.

243
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,560
Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 are both, they both still look great, but I understand the

244
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
desire to...

245
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,280
It's the physics and stuff.

246
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
That's all the same.

247
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,000
Maybe Valve is waiting for the next wave of consoles, maybe at this point don't make a

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
PlayStation 3 game.

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,600
They just need to come out with a game that's just all the Source games kind of combined

250
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
in the one.

251
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,440
You got a little bit of Half Life, you got a little bit of Portal in there, a little

252
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,440
bit of Left 4 Dead, just a mix, you know, just a mixing of everything.

253
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,560
A little bit of Team Fortress 2.

254
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,600
Half Life 2 Episode 3 was supposed to heavily involve Aperture Science.

255
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:10,600
And because Portal was such a huge hit, it almost makes me wonder if they want to keep

256
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,120
those worlds separate now.

257
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,960
Because you're supposed to go up to like the North Pole or the South Pole to find the ship

258
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
and blah, blah, blah.

259
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,000
So yeah, Aperture Science was supposed to be in Episode 3 and now I don't know if they're

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,640
trying to write their way around that.

261
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,760
Because of all the story in Portal 2 about Aperture Science, certainly.

262
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Yeah.

263
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,040
That could be an interesting monkey wrench.

264
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,520
Anyhow, I didn't mean to get us too far on the tangent.

265
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,720
Let's go back to how Steam Sale wrecked your week.

266
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,720
Anything else, Loki, that you bought on the sale?

267
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
No, that was it.

268
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,000
Just those three games.

269
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,560
I'll go.

270
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,480
I bought Civilization V for Alan because just like how I bully him into coming on this show,

271
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,160
clearly, I'm going to talk to him about playing Civ V with me.

272
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
Aren't you excited?

273
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Yes.

274
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I installed it.

275
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Hooray!

276
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
That's progress.

277
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,480
I bought Civ V Gods and Kings for myself because it was like 20% off, which I figured for a

278
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,720
game that's only like two months old is probably as low as it's going to get.

279
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,960
So I bought that.

280
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:15,680
And I bought a four-pack of Dungeon Defenders because it was cheap and I heard it's kind

281
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,000
of good, so I bought that.

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,200
Why'd you buy four of them?

283
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,040
So that I could give Alan one and I gave one to another.

284
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I gave one to Shane.

285
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,640
What is Dungeon Defenders anyway?

286
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
I haven't decided what I'm doing with the fourth one yet.

287
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,080
It's co-op tower defense, I think.

288
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,840
That sounds fun.

289
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Do you not have it, Loki?

290
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
I don't have it.

291
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Well, now you do.

292
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
There's my fourth copy.

293
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
There you go.

294
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Sweet.

295
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
I bought it for Loki.

296
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
I did it for you, bro.

297
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Thank you.

298
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
All right.

299
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
There you go.

300
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
That's one genre I haven't really gotten into.

301
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Tower defense stuff.

302
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,840
Well, actually, I guess I have.

303
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,040
I play the stick war games on the IOS, but I kind of, I don't know, it'd be fun.

304
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
All right.

305
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
And I'm trying to think.

306
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
There was something else.

307
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Oh, yeah.

308
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,160
I bought Skyrim, which I think I talked about on last week's show.

309
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,920
My memory's a little fuzzy, but I bought Skyrim on PC just because I wanted to be able to

310
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
mod it.

311
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,120
And, you know, I had it on PlayStation 3, but it's just not, it's not PC.

312
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,200
And I got to say, after installing that high res texture pack and everything, very nice,

313
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,040
very nice, very nice looking game.

314
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,280
And all the mods are very cool and the Steam Workshop, and it's very easy to get that stuff

315
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
in there.

316
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,180
And Alan, Alan's great.

317
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,960
He sent me an email saying like, okay, here are the must have mods.

318
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,520
You need this and this and this and this, and he just gave me a list.

319
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,680
All quality of life stuff, like the default UI for inventory and spells is shit.

320
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,220
So here's a mod that makes it pretty.

321
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,960
Tiger Claw, who's participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com says, can your PC run

322
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,360
Skyrim fine?

323
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,940
Yeah, it's running great.

324
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,680
I don't think it's like the highest, highest settings, but my video card's fairly new.

325
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,600
It's only about a year old and, you know, I have a fairly powerful PC.

326
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
It's just very loud.

327
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,240
That's the only problem with my PC is that when the fans are running, you should hear

328
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,600
mine because it's under the desk.

329
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
That's why it's muted.

330
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
Mine's a beast.

331
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,640
Your PC is way better than mine and I run games fine, so you shouldn't have a problem.

332
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,000
My PC at home, I need to upgrade everything on it because, you know, it was back when

333
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,400
the 8800, you know, Nvidia cards were new.

334
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:23,840
So I have a dual 8800 GTS 512s running SLI and have a dual core because it was a core

335
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,860
2 dual before they had all these i5s, i7s and stuff like that.

336
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,920
But it's overclocked to almost 4 gigs.

337
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,560
But it's still, you know, those cards kind of hold it back.

338
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,480
Bobby Blackwolf who tapes before us at 5 o'clock Pacific 8 Eastern at VODnetwork.com every

339
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,920
Sunday night is sending a link that he, I saw your tweet on this earlier, Bobby.

340
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
That's how I know what this is.

341
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,840
It's the Minecraft mod for Skyrim that actually changes your companion to Steve the Minecraft

342
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
dude and all that.

343
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm just afraid once I do start modding this is it's going to get weird really fast because

344
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,200
I'm going to have to get, you know, the macho man dragon mod.

345
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,320
Oh, I got to get that still.

346
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,880
Thank you for reminding me.

347
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,200
That one also, a quick, I guess a, we actually have somebody in chat too named macho man,

348
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,840
so maybe you'll get an, oh yeah.

349
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,720
So there's also, you know, the, in case you're not a macho man fan, they have the My Little

350
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Pony ones that turn the dragons into that and the extra magic, the extra magic one is

351
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
pretty cool.

352
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,400
They have different, let's just be real.

353
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,160
It's for the weed smokers.

354
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,600
They have, they have the Brony mod for the weed smokers.

355
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,760
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

356
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,280
I'm just saying.

357
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,580
I just want to see what kind of, I mean it's going to look nothing like that.

358
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
That's the fun of it.

359
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
Like I've played Skyrim.

360
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,600
Skyrim is fun and I'm still playing it on 360.

361
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,040
I haven't, I haven't picked up DLC cause I think it's a waste of money right now.

362
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,980
But um, I just want to make the PC version look nothing like the original game and just

363
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,360
have it be frigging crazy.

364
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,360
Just batshit crazy.

365
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,820
Black Wolf is also asking in chat, can Alan post his essential Skyrim mod list to the

366
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
forums?

367
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,840
Well, I've actually been trying to nudge him into doing an article for the site on that.

368
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,500
Nudge, nudge, nudge, nudge.

369
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,360
Can I talk about the steam workshop?

370
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
Yes sir.

371
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,280
As someone who likes to mod PC games, the steam workshop is amazing and how incredibly

372
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,800
easy it is to just install a mod.

373
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,860
And if you don't like it, it's gone.

374
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,140
It's like a one click process within steam.

375
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,800
The problem that I have with it is that a lot of really awesome mod authors aren't on

376
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,980
it just because they don't, they're fine with nexus, which was the old school modding site.

377
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,600
So there's a lot of amazing Skyrim mods, especially UI and quality of life stuff that isn't on

378
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,020
the steam workshop.

379
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,600
So if I make a list, I can say, here's how you install stuff from nexus, but here's the

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,840
easy stuff from steam workshop.

381
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I don't know.

382
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,220
I think it's okay.

383
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,680
I have faith that most of our listeners could figure it out.

384
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,620
Well, yeah, a lot of people are intimidated by modding and the steam workshop is absolutely,

385
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,740
it's an amazing progression.

386
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,300
It's very innovative on that stuff, but it's kind of split the community up a bit because

387
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,160
now there's two different sources for mods.

388
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,420
ActDeft is trying to share this mod that he says I should get called the Yay mod.

389
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,700
He says, screw the Macho Man mod, get the Yay mod.

390
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,980
And I'm like, dear God, what is that?

391
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
And he sent me a YouTube.

392
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,220
Usually I don't play YouTube on the show without looking at them first, but for Yay mod, I'll

393
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,500
take a risk.

394
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
ActDeft don't ruin my show.

395
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Here we go.

396
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Let's see.

397
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:47,340
So the guys in the dungeon, see what happens.

398
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,140
If you don't know the elements of good cheer yet, you should try out these cheat codes.

399
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,740
I don't know what that's going to do.

400
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,220
All right.

401
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,940
ActDeft when does this get good?

402
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,260
Oh, the guy's typing it in.

403
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Let's see what happens.

404
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:08,540
I think it was only a minute and a half long.

405
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,460
Come on.

406
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,420
Okay.

407
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,540
Nothing good's happening.

408
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,460
ActDeft you should have just gave you a timestamp and said, bump it to like a minute, five

409
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,180
five.

410
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,860
I'm more interested in this because everything's in German right now.

411
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm sure dragon shouts in German are terrifying.

412
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:47,420
I just realized it says my little pony friendship is magic in the title, so I'm a little worried.

413
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,180
I might need to smoke a little bit of something before this will actually make sense.

414
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,340
Is that the trick?

415
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,060
It's probably a dragon shout that's my little pony.

416
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,540
There's now a dragon shout that says yay.

417
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:08,980
Now to the fun part with 10 seconds left in the video.

418
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,980
That's it?

419
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
Yay.

420
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,940
Oh, and I give that on a scale of one to 10, about a 1.5.

421
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,780
Sorry, ActDeft.

422
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,540
That was the stoppage of the show.

423
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,900
And Bobby Black Wolf in chat said, Wolf rather, that he's installed mods from Nexus.

424
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:33,060
Nexus does have its own little Nexus mod manager app, but a lot of people are like, I don't

425
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,120
want to install this five meg little weird ass app.

426
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,700
So it kind of has a Steam Workshop alternative, but yeah, I can post all that to the forums.

427
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Sounds good.

428
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Yeah.

429
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,460
Oh, and another thing about the Steam Workshop, and this is because I'm a huge pervert.

430
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,820
Sometimes mods, modders, especially in like the Grand Theft Auto franchise, like to make

431
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,260
people naked or make their clothes really slutty, even if you strip them and they still

432
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,740
have underwear on, just like cleavage and the big boobs, that stuff's not on Steam Workshop.

433
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,940
So if you want an NC-17 R-rated Skyrim, like I do, you're going to want to go to Nexus

434
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
for that.

435
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,220
Hey man, they do some good work on Lydia.

436
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,300
Yeah, there's a bunch of Lydia mods where it's not appropriate for this show.

437
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,900
That's what we're talking about, this show is appropriate for everything.

438
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,820
This isn't the Bobby Black Wolf show, Alan.

439
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,180
They have some deep cleavage for those characters.

440
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,580
All right, Alan, what was the damage for you this week, because I know you went shopping.

441
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,100
Oh yeah, I think from the very first day of the sale, I think it's dinged me collectively

442
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:50,660
for, I want to say 50 or 55 bucks, but it's $3.50 here, $8.99 here.

443
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,780
The big thing that I got was Saints Row 3 was knocked down to like $7.49 and then that

444
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,820
plus all of the DLC, all of it, I think was like $22.99.

445
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,700
So I picked that up, just inhaled all that down.

446
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:12,020
Spoiler, most of the DLC sucks, actually spoiler, all of the DLC sucks.

447
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:17,260
One thing I noticed, and you're the one who pointed this out, there's the daily sales

448
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,940
that actually last about two hours.

449
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,340
There are the flash sales and then there are the community vote sales.

450
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,420
Those prices have been cycling through every day or like twice a day every other day for

451
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,680
the whole sale.

452
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,100
It's a genius move on Valve's part because it makes it look like they're putting all

453
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,880
this stuff constantly on sale, but all it is, they have the daily sales and the votes

454
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,380
and the flash sales are just the same things as the daily sales, just cycling through at

455
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,380
random intervals.

456
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,380
It's genius.

457
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,580
If the thing that you voted on for the community sale didn't win, it's probably going to be

458
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,300
a part of the daily sale the next day or the day after, or it'll be one of the flash sales

459
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
at the bottom.

460
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,940
So you're going to get that game.

461
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:58,500
Well, remember that for Christmas because it's too late now.

462
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Because remember when Civ 5, I think, was like, what, eight bucks?

463
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,600
And people were like, fuck, I missed Civ 5 for eight bucks.

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,220
It's been eight bucks like three separate times since that you said that.

465
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,980
So they keep bringing those prices back and making us think they're unique.

466
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
All right.

467
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,920
So I think we've talked enough about our Steam addiction this week and the stuff we've bought.

468
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,320
Let's get into a similar topic because it's how we always start the show.

469
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,500
How was your gaming week?

470
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
What?

471
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,540
Because the Steam sale is just about buying a bunch of games.

472
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,100
It doesn't mean you're going to play them.

473
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,140
So what did you actually play this week?

474
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
How was your gaming week?

475
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Sorry.

476
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,460
I had to make one more purchase here real quick.

477
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
Oh, God.

478
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,460
What happened?

479
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Just Cause 2 is $3.74.

480
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,700
That game is fucking awesome.

481
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,460
And for $3.74, I have to buy that.

482
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Feed Gabe Newell.

483
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Feed him.

484
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
I can't stop.

485
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,900
See, like, before, like, was it the stupid indie?

486
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,100
I blame the humble indie bundles because, God damn it, I didn't have Steam and all this

487
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,540
shit before that.

488
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,500
And now, and now I'm sucked into this.

489
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
All right.

490
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,100
Well, I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but I am going to say pause for a minute

491
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,540
and tell us about your gaming week first.

492
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
All right.

493
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
All right.

494
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
Thanks.

495
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:12,100
So this week, I played Borderlands because I picked it up on the Steam sale on PC.

496
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,060
So I've been kind of going back and replaying that again since I want to kind of remember

497
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:21,980
a little bit what happens for the, you know, sequel so that I can, you know, bust that

498
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,740
out when it comes out in September.

499
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,420
And it's fun.

500
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I like it.

501
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,640
And of course, I went ahead and modded it again.

502
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,900
It's been a while since I've actually played that game.

503
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,700
So they've patched it a few more times and you can't do some of the really cool guns

504
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,080
that you had before.

505
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,700
But there's still, like, some pretty awesome ones in there that you can mod.

506
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
So I have some of those.

507
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,420
I have a pistol now that takes people's heads off and stuff.

508
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,660
Oh, how pleasant.

509
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,460
It just makes them explode, it's like, hi, mirror gun.

510
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
So there's that.

511
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,620
And then, let's see, besides Borderlands, I actually finished, I was installing a bunch

512
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,620
of stuff.

513
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:06,260
I have I Wanna Be The Guy, the original, played a little bit of that, just like maybe 15 minutes

514
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,260
of it.

515
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,860
And then I Wanna Be The Guy, I played a little bit of that.

516
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,740
The only thing I don't like about it, and I'm sure this is on purpose, is like the little,

517
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,340
they have this sort of Super Mario World world select screen or whatever that, of course,

518
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,700
you can die in because, you know, I want to be the guy.

519
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,460
And I don't like the fact that you can't stop moving in that because it's, you know, you

520
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,060
push left to right and your guy just keeps walking and there's a spot where you have

521
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,860
to kind of sit still before, you know, you do something.

522
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,540
So it's a little annoying, but I'm sure it's like that on purpose.

523
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,220
Then I played a little bit of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, we played the new terminal

524
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,820
map that they had, which was kind of a remake from Modern Warfare 2.

525
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,320
And it's a great map, so we've been enjoying that quite a bit.

526
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,200
Haven't really been practicing too much for the tournament coming up, although I have

527
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,780
been playing my class that I'm going to be using for the tournament because, like I mentioned

528
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,440
last week, I'm going to be entering a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 tournament one, almost

529
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,500
a week from today.

530
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,060
It's next Saturday, so I'm looking forward to that.

531
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,060
That'll be kind of fun.

532
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,580
Driving down to Stockton for those.

533
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,780
That's next week?

534
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
That's next week.

535
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
It's going to be a big week next week.

536
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Yeah.

537
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Excited.

538
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,780
I was going to do that.

539
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:30,700
Minecraft's been playing my new world I started with my coworker, and we've been playing that

540
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,140
just on Easy.

541
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,500
And it's kind of a different type of game.

542
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:45,540
I created a mob drowning machine thing, so it drowns some of the mobs and some of them

543
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,540
get through.

544
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,180
But it's kind of interesting.

545
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:58,660
And I don't know, just I think that was about, oh, I had been selling some stuff on eBay.

546
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,080
I guess I must have bought something on eBay not too long ago because I had like $6 worth

547
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:12,300
of, it was like $6.60 in eBay bucks that they have you earn like, I don't remember what

548
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,160
the ratio is, but you're in like free money basically.

549
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,820
So I was bored one day, I'm like, okay, I never really spend these, so I'm going to

550
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,660
find something that's gaming related under $6.60.

551
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,840
I'm going to try to find the best value for my money.

552
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,820
And so I was searching around and I actually found a digital copy of Child of Eden for

553
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,780
$6.

554
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,540
So I picked that up because that's a no brainer.

555
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,820
So hopefully I'll get back to playing that on the 360 again.

556
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,260
And I think that's all I played this week.

557
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Awesome.

558
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,300
I'll go next because I didn't play a lot of new games this week.

559
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,500
I mean, I think I talked about most of the stuff in the Steam sale.

560
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,020
I didn't play enough Dungeon Defenders to really review it yet.

561
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,860
So I'll come back to that next week.

562
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,180
I did play a little bit of Civ V Gods and Kings, but I didn't, like, you know, you have

563
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,060
to really book out a chunk of time to play that game.

564
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,340
And I started playing it and I didn't really have a whole lot of time and I was playing

565
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,340
sloppy.

566
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,140
And for some reason I decided to go for a military victory and I never do military victories.

567
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,660
And I was spreading myself too thin on all fronts.

568
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,420
So I was getting my butt kicked on like an easy level and I was like, forget it, stop,

569
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
delete.

570
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
I'll come back to this later.

571
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,420
So yeah.

572
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,860
Didn't really get to do a whole lot there.

573
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,940
Played a little bit of WoW, played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 online on PC.

574
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,780
And I got to admit, I'm a little disappointed.

575
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,620
I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.

576
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,620
You all know.

577
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Go ahead.

578
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,260
Double fold, there's two reasons, well, one reason for me, two reasons for you on why

579
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,020
it's shitty and why you're not going to play it anymore.

580
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,720
Well, I don't know, like I'm threatening not to play it anymore, but I think we all know

581
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,580
somebody will be like, please come play with me and I'll be like, okay.

582
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,980
But I'm just, I'm really frustrated and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.

583
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:04,740
Origin, and I hate to say this because I know people that work at Origin, but it's not good.

584
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,500
Like I'm sorry, I can't, I'm really frustrated with it.

585
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,340
And a lot of it has to do with connection issues.

586
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:14,420
I'm consistently having on Origin and this whole, Alan, you can explain it better than

587
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,420
I can, the two, two people in one place can't battle two people in another place.

588
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,380
So a very obvious four person setup, couple and couple playing the game together.

589
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
It won't, yeah.

590
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,380
It won't do it.

591
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
Origin won't let you do it.

592
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
Yeah.

593
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Cause we're, we play on NAT via router.

594
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,420
We just have the one IP and that's cool.

595
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,360
Rob and myself can go in, we can play our own separate matches.

596
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,540
We can do co-op with two public pugs that we let in through the like the public match.

597
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
That's fine.

598
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:50,780
But Origin, it's network kernel can only keep track of one IP with two sessions on it.

599
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,260
It can't do it for another IP with two sessions on it.

600
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:57,980
So when we try to play with our friends who are in the exact same setup as us, the third

601
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,620
person could get, could get on.

602
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,740
But when the fourth person tries, they time out.

603
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,820
Or if the match is already in progress, it will time out the person at their house while

604
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,020
the fourth person tries to get in.

605
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,940
I know this makes no sense at this point, but yeah, it's TLDR, it's shitty.

606
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,580
It's shitty and it's peer to peer, which is why it has this problem XBLA and I think PSN

607
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,820
is all server based.

608
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,260
So the matching service on Mass Effect 3 is, is peer to peer and that's why it has all

609
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,260
these problems.

610
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,300
And let me tell you what I've had to put up with to play what is otherwise a great game.

611
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:35,180
Again, I don't get into online shooter games ever, but Mass Effect 3, which isn't really

612
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,160
a shooter, but it kind of is, like it has defied that trend.

613
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,980
But what I have to do to play this fucking game on Origin, log into the game, wait while

614
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,780
it connects to Origin.

615
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,260
Okay, game is connected to Origin.

616
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:54,480
Now the menu is up, wait while it loads my galacticness ready, readiness rating or whatever

617
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
it's called.

618
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,460
Okay, now select multiplayer, wait for multiplayer to load.

619
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,180
All right, let me connect to my friend.

620
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
Wait to connect to the friend.

621
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,300
It takes like four minutes to get into a freaking match.

622
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,140
I bet what it's doing for those first two big lags when it opens up the galactic, I

623
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,460
bet that's all like the DRM, Origin security stuff going through.

624
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,700
It's gotta be.

625
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,740
Which is ridiculous.

626
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,660
Like it's stopped, like do it once, do it once every 10 connections just to stop bogging

627
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,100
my game down because it's really ruining it for me.

628
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,060
And then what really just set me over the edge was that we played a game the other night.

629
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,540
It was me, you and our friend Tim.

630
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,180
We were three manning some bronze maps, which we can do to full extraction.

631
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,440
And we were playing those online.

632
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,860
We played two matches and I got about 30,000 credits.

633
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,540
I leveled one guy from 19 to 20 and another, my engineer from like one to six.

634
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,740
Yeah, lost all that.

635
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,700
After I disconnected from the match, lost it all, rolled back, wrote EA customer support.

636
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,980
Please give me back what I lost.

637
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,420
I got a reply back, sorry, can't do that.

638
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,220
No, you can do it.

639
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,140
You don't want to because you think I'm trying to, you know, get it from you or steal it

640
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
from you.

641
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
This is ridiculous.

642
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
And I'm kind of over it.

643
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,140
Yeah.

644
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,900
Xbox has its share of connection problems too, honestly.

645
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,500
Cause with Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, aside from the galactic readiness and the first

646
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,580
player part of it, there's the challenge.

647
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,800
But then aside from the challenge of shooting shit, you get credits and you buy these goodie

648
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,100
packs and you unlock new characters.

649
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,860
That's why people play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is because they want to play as a Vortia.

650
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,940
They want to play as an Asari.

651
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:33,100
So if you're not getting your credits, that's, that's why you're playing is to buy it unless

652
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,300
you want to get Bioware points, but.

653
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,980
Which I refuse to, and then I have saved up for so many of these packs and then this gets

654
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,460
into a little bit of like, you know, it's not fair.

655
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
The game's not fair.

656
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,060
I have yet, I've unlocked two characters out of like the 40 there is.

657
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,340
And the way you unlock stuff is ridiculous because it's all RNG.

658
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,380
You buy a goodie box and then pray you get the shit you want in it.

659
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,780
And it's totally random.

660
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,860
So Osfer says in our chat room, just calm down and play the game on 360 after the show

661
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,860
tonight.

662
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,100
We'll have a proper multiplayer game.

663
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Yeah, I can play it on PC.

664
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,580
You can play it on 360.

665
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,580
Maybe.

666
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,420
I mean, I'm not saying no to like playing games on 360, but like all these issues, no

667
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,940
matter what platform, I'm kind of like over Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and I'm ready for

668
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,580
a new game and I'm ready for some single player content.

669
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,540
That's why we're going to play Borderlands, maybe.

670
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Maybe.

671
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
Or Civ V, maybe.

672
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:32,540
You do realize Borderlands 2, you can play split screen on one Xbox 360 system and then

673
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,420
also with that split screen play against other people.

674
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,820
You know, we can do co-op and you can both play on the same TV.

675
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,460
Come to Borderlands 2.

676
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,260
I want to check out Borderlands 1 again.

677
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,340
I only played it a little bit before and got distracted, so yeah, I'll definitely check

678
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
that out.

679
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Fantastic.

680
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,340
Yeah.

681
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,940
So, um, yeah, that's my little like origin rant and just, it's, it's, it's set me as

682
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:03,580
it is setting EA as a company back, but of course EA is doing it to themselves.

683
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,740
So you know, what can you do?

684
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,460
So um, let's see, I guess that's it for my gaming week.

685
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
I've ran it enough.

686
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Alan, how about you?

687
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:19,140
Um, Mass Effect 3, we already talked about that plenty, so I'm not going to get into

688
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
that.

689
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,900
LA Noire, which I've been playing, I'm almost near the end.

690
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,720
I kind of want to beat it, not because it's boring, but I am using a FAQ so I can get

691
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,500
everything the first time through and just follow the narrative of it.

692
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,100
And with the FAQ, that game's kind of boring, whereas other games, if you follow a FAQ,

693
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,700
you still have the, the mechanics of it keeping it fun.

694
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,660
So a shitload of LA Noire, um, thanks to the Steam sale, it was dirt cheap.

695
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,300
So I got it for like 10, 12 bucks with it and all the DLC cases, um, enjoying that.

696
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,820
Uh, I was playing Saints Row the third.

697
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,180
I'm on the mission where you parachute onto the top of the building and Kanye West is

698
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
playing.

699
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:08,340
Yeah, that's, it's like an hour or so or so in, um, played a lot with the character creator,

700
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,660
um, in that, uh, oh,

701
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,940
Oh, you have that game on PC, right?

702
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
Yeah.

703
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Yeah.

704
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,420
You might check a gentleman of the row.

705
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,780
They have a lot of cool enhancements and stuff for both Saints Row two and Saints Row the

706
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
third.

707
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,300
Have you been, uh, have you been laughing your ass off at Saints Row three?

708
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
Like I was especially that parachuting thing.

709
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Yeah.

710
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,300
It was funny.

711
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,500
Cause you throw Shonda, you're just like, I'll catch you later.

712
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,540
She's like, I'm dying.

713
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,680
We're falling towards the ground and yeah.

714
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,660
And people are shooting at you with no, no parachutes on.

715
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,780
They're killing themselves trying to kill you.

716
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:46,980
Um, I installed a game that I hadn't played in a couple of years, postal two for anyone

717
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:53,420
who remembers that it's actually, it's a really, it's incredibly vulgar and offensive in a

718
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,420
lot of ways, but it's a first person shooter.

719
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,340
It's, you know, data it's seven days of the week I got the expansion.

720
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,720
So I was playing postal two for some reason.

721
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,860
I'm like, I just want to play a really offensive, awful first person shooter.

722
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,700
I think, Oh, um, I guess I'll make this a part of my gaming week.

723
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:19,540
I decided to check out my PSP, my slim, which is, um, got custom firmware on it.

724
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,860
Just to see if there are any custom firmware updates, keep, you know, up to date, maybe

725
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,340
check out some of the UMDs I have.

726
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:32,700
And I noticed when I turned it on that there's this weird spotting discoloration splotches

727
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:37,260
around the border of my screen and I Googled it and it turns out this is a known issue

728
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,420
for older PSPs and we don't live here in Sacramento.

729
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,940
It's like 102 degrees outside right now.

730
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,980
I don't live in San Bruno anymore where it's, where it's foggy, but there's, this is a known

731
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
issue.

732
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,920
There's mold under my LCD between the glass and the backlit portion.

733
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,540
It's it's, it's just a slight discoloration.

734
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,860
If Jamie was here, I'd have her take a picture of it and put it on the flicker stream.

735
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,580
Hey, I saw someone else.

736
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,040
But I guess, yeah, this is a thing.

737
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,940
You get mold under your L it's when I'm actually playing, when I'm actually playing like a

738
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:17,420
bright game, like prep of the rapper, really any game, it's the colors and the movement

739
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,800
doesn't really notice.

740
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,780
I don't really notice it that much, but on like just the crossbar, the menu screen, I'm

741
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,500
like, this sucks.

742
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,900
I don't know if it's mold though cause it's, um, it's almost like just this, the LCD screen

743
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,980
just kind of going out or something cause you can see if you turn it, it changes the

744
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,260
colors and stuff of it.

745
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,340
It looks, and it's, Ooh, it's all splotchy.

746
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,340
Yeah.

747
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,340
Gross.

748
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,340
It's like a disease.

749
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,340
It looks like your PSP has shingles.

750
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,340
You want to put it down.

751
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,420
I don't want to get it.

752
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,280
So yeah, I've heard people say like, not that this is a fix for it, but someone, I was reading

753
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,940
a forum post and someone was like, what if you put it under a UV light for like a day?

754
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,900
Well, the UV light kill them, kill the fungus under there.

755
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,500
And I'm like, I'm not doing that, but yeah, it's, um, if you have a PSP and it's been

756
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,760
in your closet for a year cause you don't play PSP anymore, turn it on and see if it's

757
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,900
got weird splotches under it.

758
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,100
I got 2000 having a really powered it on a long time.

759
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,860
So yeah, my PSP has crud.

760
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Wow.

761
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
It needs antibiotics.

762
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,140
You can probably just get a new screen if you want.

763
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,140
All right.

764
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,240
Well, uh, it's not like you leave that thing in the bathroom.

765
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,660
You know, you would like in the bathroom, you might expect to get moldy cause you know,

766
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,020
the steam from the shower and all that, you know, in the living room on our shelf.

767
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,240
Yeah, that's weird.

768
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,060
And when I, when I last turned this on here, it's not even human.

769
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,440
When I, I think I turned this on last around Christmas and it was fine.

770
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,420
So it's something that's happened within the last six months.

771
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,420
Worry about my PSP now.

772
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,420
Yeah.

773
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,100
Cause that's, it's been years for yours and we need to watch the, or we need to turn on

774
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,940
the Vita every couple, you're still watching Netflix on the Vita, right?

775
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
Yeah.

776
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,940
All right.

777
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Good.

778
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
All right.

779
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,500
Um, well if that's it for your gaming week, let me get into housekeeping real quick and

780
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
then we'll get into the news.

781
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,780
Um, some quick housekeeping tonight.

782
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:09,220
Um, first off the summer fest for PlayStation home is next week.

783
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,420
You can read more about that at the VOG networks website, vog network.com, but we will be live

784
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,820
in PlayStation home kind of being there exploring in the Aurora's space and meeting some people

785
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,900
virtually as well as broadcasting at the same time.

786
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:29,120
Um, don't worry though if you don't even have a PlayStation three, nothing's going to change

787
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
for you.

788
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,020
You just, you know, you won't be able to participate in going into home, but you're not going to

789
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,020
miss anything.

790
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,300
We're still broadcasting the way we always do and all that.

791
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,460
It's just kind of like we'll have a second chat room and PlayStation home that night,

792
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,580
but we're looking forward to it.

793
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,900
It's kind of neat cause you get to involve games and the social aspect of it and maybe

794
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,560
meet some new listeners and some listeners that want to come into the home space.

795
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
So it's a lot of fun.

796
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,420
Uh, again, that's happening in the Aurora space during next week's Bobby Black Wolf

797
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,420
show and our show.

817
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,240
I feel like I'm forgetting something, but if I think of it, I'll, I'll come back to

818
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
it later.

819
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,760
So let's get started with tonight's news in the meantime, Loki.

820
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,280
So I'm sure this is going to come to a shock to a lot of people, but there's a rumor that

821
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,200
final fantasy 13 versus is dead.

822
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:31,640
I know shocking that, you know, a game that we haven't seen much of for six years, um,

823
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,260
not coming out, but, uh, yeah.

824
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:41,680
And this is coming from some inside sources, um, that apparently Kotaku is talking to.

825
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,400
And they're saying that, you know, it's officially canceled, but I mean, I don't know if it's

826
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,920
officially canceled or if it's just going to be retitled.

827
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,760
They haven't made a statement, right?

828
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,200
There's no been no PR bulletin or anything.

829
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Okay.

830
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
Yeah.

831
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,840
It's, it's, uh, the last thing I think it's, we, we're almost done with preparing our latest

832
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,160
info for the game because of a totally unrelated reason.

833
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,800
There are circumstances in which, uh, that info cannot be released.

834
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,780
So info for that game, maybe it's now no longer versus because honestly, 13 verses, it still

835
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,280
didn't make any sense to me why it's called that because both games, you know, it looks

836
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,040
nothing like final fantasy 13 at all.

837
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,180
And there's nothing so far that they've shown us.

838
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,240
That's led me to believe that's even in the same universe as 13.

839
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,400
I think some of the mythology is supposed to be the same, like the whole lacy and the

840
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,400
fallacy and all that.

841
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,320
I think it's supposed to be like a constant because it wasn't, I want to say it was a

842
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,080
trilogy, but there was the main story and then the two guidance side stories, one for

843
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,280
the PSP and then versus 13.

844
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
Yeah.

845
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,160
There's supposed to be some common thread, no matter, regardless of how thin tying it

846
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
all together.

847
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,520
Final fantasy, a guy toe or whatever it was called, excuse me, if I'm butchering that

848
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,960
name, it just became fun fancy type zero.

849
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,200
So why wouldn't find fancy 13 versus just become something else, which folks are speculating.

850
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,840
Including me on this show a couple months ago, I think I said, why don't they just make

851
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,840
it final fantasy 15 at this point, it would make a lot of sense because we're starting

852
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,920
to get into the next cycle of consoles yet.

853
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,020
We're supposed to get, I mean, you know, again, square can do whatever they want, but historically

854
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,720
there has always been three final fantasy games on every console.

855
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Think about it.

856
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,200
One through three was on the NES, even though two and three didn't come out here in America,

857
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,860
four or five and six was on the super Nintendo.

858
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,480
Even though five didn't come out in North America, but it did later seven, eight, nine,

859
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:36,440
PlayStation one, 10, 11, 12, PlayStation two, 13, 14, 13, two, 13, two.

860
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Yeah.

861
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,760
So, and technically 14 isn't out on consoles yet, although it's still slated, I mean, 14,

862
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,580
or we should say 11, two, because it's basically the 11 characters with their names changed.

863
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,280
So they could very well, instead of saying the falsy and lussy or whatever, they could

864
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,400
be like, they're the, we're just going to go back to espers.

865
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,720
They're espers now, or they're summons or they're, um, I don't know, let's make up another

866
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,720
name for summons.

867
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,320
Well, they could just, it's final fantasy blank.

868
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,320
They could think of a name for it, you know, just like there was final fantasy tactics.

869
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,240
It wasn't really a final fantasy game, but kind of in that universe, it was a great game.

870
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,380
Was that kind of a name?

871
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,680
So I don't know.

872
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,520
And you can't count 13, two really as a game in the, I mean, because then you'd have to

873
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,040
count 10, two, and then you'd have to count dirge of Cerberus and it throws everything

874
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,040
off.

875
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,040
So you can't do that.

876
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,280
Those are all spin-offs, but I guess we're going to have a definitive answer come what

877
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,440
September 1st, because there's supposed to be some Tokyo game show at least by then.

878
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,120
Well, square's doing some type of final fantasy.

879
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:45,820
Like they even said, what is next in the final fantasy 13 universe on September 1st.

880
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:55,600
And so either that's versus has a new name or it's, or all of this is proven false because

881
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,360
again, it is a rumor.

882
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:01,740
I mean it, you know, it's not like everything Kotaku's ever said has turned out to be true.

883
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,240
Think about it.

884
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,880
And there's also a possibility and a lot of people are saying, well, what else could they

885
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,880
do?

886
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,760
But final fantasy 13, three, wouldn't that be something?

887
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:22,360
Which is weird because if it's true that there's a final fantasy 13, three, which would make

888
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
a lot of sense.

889
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,000
I think 13 do did pretty good.

890
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,920
It probably wasn't as expensive to make because they made it on the same engine.

891
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,120
They had all that DLC for it, which I'm sure made them money too.

892
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,360
13, three actually makes a lot of sense for them to do.

893
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:42,660
But it's weird because final fantasy 13 was supposed to be three separate games.

894
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,560
And now final fantasy 13 might, if these theories prove to end up being three games that are

895
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,600
all just one, two, three, final fantasy 13, one, two, three.

896
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,360
It's kind of weird how it transformed like that.

897
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,240
Alan?

898
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,200
And I think the reason why a lot of people are invested in this story is for those who

899
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,200
don't follow Square Enix that closely.

900
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,400
The crew that like the director and the main crew who did the Kingdom Hearts console games

901
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,420
have been working on 13 versus 13 for however five, six years.

902
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,600
So for it to become vaporware maybe would piss a lot of people off because depending

903
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,880
on how tinfoil hat you want to get, the Kingdom Hearts console team has been working on it.

904
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,960
So they need to have a product out so they can work on the next Kingdom Hearts.

905
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,400
I just can't see Square just throwing it away.

906
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,900
I could see where Square has decided Kingdom Hearts three needs to happen now.

907
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,520
And so maybe they have maybe they've said, you know what, guys, you've had this game

908
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,400
for two F and long.

909
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,360
So we're taking it away from you and giving it to this other team.

910
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,880
And we're going to put it out under a new name and you guys go work on Kingdom Hearts

911
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
three.

912
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,280
I mean, anything is possible in that regard, but just for them to throw away six years

913
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,520
worth of work.

914
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,580
If you think about everybody's salary that gets paid for that, that's millions of dollars

915
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,580
they're throwing away.

916
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,580
If they do that.

917
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
And I highly doubt they're going to be thrown away.

918
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,840
A lot of final fantasy games before remember all that stuff that grin was working on, they

919
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,640
were working on a final fantasy game and that, but that was grin.

920
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,040
That wasn't, you know, I understand that, but they, they're not beyond throwing.

921
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,060
Although some things that they should really throw out 14, um, they just don't and they

922
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,060
hold on.

923
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,060
That's the other thing.

924
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,520
Maybe final, maybe they're realizing they need to rush 15 because 14, they need to erase

925
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,120
14 basically, which is still getting relaunched.

926
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:35,120
Well, I've also saw speculation that the reason why there's no press release saying yes versus

927
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,960
13, this is what's happened to it, whether it be canceled or whatever is because their

928
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,240
last year fiscally was so bad because of 14 shedding the bed that they're just not putting

929
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,420
out negative press releases anymore because of damage control from 14.

930
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,920
But that's kind of, I don't, that's a thought, um, I don't want to drag this out too long,

931
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,920
much longer.

932
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,680
I want to get to the next story, but I do want to kind of throw this idea out there

933
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,620
because somebody on Facebook had said this and I was like, Hmm, that's a good point.

934
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:07,480
Is that, well, if they canceled final fantasy 13 verses, why did they just release the theme

935
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,800
song for theater rhythm?

936
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,120
Because theater rhythm has that song as a downloadable song.

937
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,240
So why would they release that if they just canceled the game and tease this final fantasy

938
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,960
13 verses?

939
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,180
Of course, this could be the case of Square Enix being a giant company.

940
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:28,480
The left hand hasn't told the right hand theater rhythm DLC team what's going on, but I thought

941
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,720
it was an interesting point.

942
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,400
So, all right, let's move on to another story.

943
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,900
This is about the Xbox 360 and something that's developing on the 360, but we didn't hear

944
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,680
anything about it at E3, but this totally seems like the type of thing they would have

945
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,680
announced, but I guess they didn't.

946
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,280
It's something called Avatar fame stars.

947
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,640
Now a trademark for the game had turned up earlier in the year, but now we're starting

948
00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,960
to see this actually appear in games, such as Wreck-A-Tear, not to be confused with the

949
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,760
game that's on Steam.

950
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,400
This is Wreck, like Wreck-It Ralph, Wreck-A-Tear.

951
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:14,240
It is part of Microsoft Summer of Arcade series, and it is including this Avatar fame stars.

952
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
What is this?

953
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,060
Quote, Avatar fame stars is a new program for Microsoft Studios and is part of a select

954
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:24,840
group of games that delivers new and exciting ways to play online with your friends and

955
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,400
compete for social recognition, according to Microsoft.

956
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:36,640
I guess this is supposed to include in-game challenges, and this sounds kind of like rebranding

957
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,040
of shit that's already been there, because if you do these challenges, or I thought achievements,

958
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,760
in these Avatar fame star games, you get rewards based on your fame star points.

959
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,080
Oh, so like rewards for my avatar.

960
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,800
Doesn't that technology already exist on the 360?

961
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,920
Like I could swear that if you play, like, Super Meat Boy, you get a t-shirt, or Minecraft,

962
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,120
and there's tons of that type of stuff in games.

963
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,680
So I'm trying to figure out, like, what is this?

964
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,680
But I guess what they're doing is instead of it being game by game by game, this is

965
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,020
one gigantic pool.

966
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,760
So like, you know, if a game is participating in this pool, then you, you know, get the

967
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,240
points and the achievement points towards a common unlock.

968
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,920
That's like the difference, which is a little weird, but that's how it works.

969
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:28,520
So the rewards cross from game to game, as does the points total.

970
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,360
Avatar fame stars is locked to your Xbox 360.

971
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,240
They're saying it's possible this is something that could spill over to Windows 8, Surface

972
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,040
tablets, Windows phones, who knows.

973
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,980
Other games that will include Avatar fame star support, Full House Poker, World of Kieflings,

974
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:50,760
so games that already exist, it's gonna be kind of patched in, Fire Pro Wrestling, Home

975
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,360
Run stars, Avatar, Motocross, Madness.

976
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,700
We don't know when the already existing games will have it patched in or when all these

977
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:03,320
other games are coming out, but I guess if you're into collecting Avatar awards, there

978
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,520
you go.

979
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,280
I don't know about you guys, but pretty much every Avatar on my friends list is all wearing

980
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,500
Mass Effect garb.

981
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Not me, though.

982
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,600
I actually tried to make my Avatar look like me.

983
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:23,360
I was a sucker and I spent like 120 Microsoft points to get a stupid hat for my Avatar that

984
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:29,480
looks like a hat I would wear out to a club, because I am a sucker.

985
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:34,240
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

986
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,760
So Valve is always trying to do great and interesting things with Steam.

987
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,680
It's a gaming store and application.

988
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:47,960
They brought Steam to Mac and Apple platforms, and they also invented Steam Play, which is

989
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,040
where if you buy a license for one game on PC, you get it for Mac and vice versa, and

990
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,160
now they're bringing Steam to Linux.

991
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,420
So there's gonna be a Steam client for Linux.

992
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:05,780
They are using the Ubuntu distribution, and for people who aren't familiar with Linux,

993
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:11,880
there's different revisions of it based on which company wrote that build of it, and

994
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,080
there's Red Hat and Corel and Ubuntu.

995
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,000
So yeah, that's what they're going for, because it's sort of the popular make of it right

996
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
now.

997
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,120
And the first game that they're porting to, their first party title that they're bringing

998
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,240
to Steam Linux is Left 4 Dead 2.

999
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:38,800
And they've been working on it since last year, 2011, and I guess there will be an internal

1000
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,620
beta of Steam on Ubuntu in the near future.

1001
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:47,240
So they've announced that it is coming soon, and Left 4 Dead 2 is the first title they're

1002
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,680
bringing to it.

1003
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,960
If other developers want to port their games over to Linux, this Valve is making the distribution

1004
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
model for it.

1005
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,920
You ran a Linux box for a while, didn't you?

1006
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,920
Kind of, yeah.

1007
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,920
I had a FreeBSD box.

1008
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,040
That was a long time ago, back when I was trying to host my own domain name and be a

1009
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,640
super nerd.

1010
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Let me ask this question.

1011
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,400
I'm gonna take it back a huge step here.

1012
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,240
I'm gonna want to ask this question, because I seriously think a lot of people don't know

1013
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,240
the answer to this.

1014
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,040
And I think sometimes the hardcore computer people, super nerds, don't realize that a

1015
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,320
lot of people don't get this, or maybe they do, I don't know.

1016
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,520
But why would someone want to have a Linux machine?

1017
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,000
What does Linux do for you that Windows doesn't?

1018
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Uptime.

1019
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
A well-made Linux install.

1020
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,780
You just have your computer on all the time.

1021
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,500
You don't lose any performance.

1022
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,900
You can put...

1023
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,080
The terminology, I haven't touched this stuff in, seriously, like ten years.

1024
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,200
But it's not...

1025
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,360
When people think Linux or Unix, they think of sort of like MS-DOS prompt, like just a

1026
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,560
text terminal.

1027
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,600
But that's not the case.

1028
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:03,640
Linux has visual Windows-ish interfaces now.

1029
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,220
If you're into independent software, like really independent, Linux has got a huge community.

1030
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,840
People making apps for each other, I don't know, it's just all about the...

1031
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,200
If you do have a good internet connection, you wanna host your own email, host your own

1032
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:21,960
domain names, host your own web server, blah, blah, blah, you're gonna be running some flavor

1033
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,520
of Linux on that box, if you wanna do all that in-house.

1034
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,160
Look at all these nerds in our chat room, and I say that lovingly.

1035
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,360
Black Wolf says, I've had a free BSD server up for over 1,000 days.

1036
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
Uptime.

1037
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Uptime.

1038
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:40,120
My home box was up for 400 days until I rebooted it recently.

1039
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:44,760
Tiger Claw says Linux is commonly used to run servers, especially for online games.

1040
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,400
Game Guru says Linux is generally more secure than Windows.

1041
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,500
Is that though because just less people use it?

1042
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:56,000
It's kinda like the whole, well, Apple never gets hacked, because there's less people on

1043
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,920
those systems than there are on...

1044
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,680
Well, there was a problem in the early 2000s where certain distributions of Linux, if you

1045
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,020
just put it on a machine, would have its email relay turned on by default.

1046
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,160
So if someone found your IP address, they could just spam the shit out of everybody

1047
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,900
using your server, and you would never know.

1048
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:19,480
So if you don't know what you're doing, people can do nasty things on your Linux box.

1049
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:25,680
But then that's your problem, it's you being an idiot, not the software being built flawed.

1050
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,920
Well Technus says, I like Linux, I hate the elitist community that comes with it.

1051
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah, FreeBSD versus Linux, or just the StarBSD versus StarLinux, that's some Star Wars Star

1052
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Trek shit.

1053
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,200
Like, there's Switchblades, and people get shivved in alleyways, it's very brutal.

1054
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,480
So Steam on Linux, do you think that would be well received by the community?

1055
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,000
Or do you think it'll be like, ugh, commercialism?

1056
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,680
Well, they would have to run, if they really wanted to play Windows games on Linux, they

1057
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,640
would have to do, I think, it's called Wine, which is kind of like, I think, Bootcamp.

1058
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,440
A lot of people on the internet wine very well.

1059
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,720
It's like Bootcamp or Parallels, I think, on Mac, where you can run Windows through

1060
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,720
it.

1061
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:19,120
So if people wanted to play PC games, but they just, I don't want a PC box in my house,

1062
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,440
I don't want a partition of a hard drive, god damn it, this will allow them to do that,

1063
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,960
for at least for Left 4 Dead 2.

1064
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,520
Anything else, if they don't want to have a Windows box or a Windows partition, they're

1065
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,640
going to have to mess with it.

1066
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,800
Alright, BlackWolf says very clearly, Wine is not an emulator, it basically implements

1067
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,440
the Windows DLLs on Linux.

1068
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,440
Okay.

1069
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,440
Alright.

1070
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
It's a little correction.

1071
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
Yep.

1072
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,520
Because remember, Linux, elitist, right Bobby?

1073
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,080
I'm just, I'm giving him a hard time.

1074
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,320
Alright, GameGrew says Left 4 Dead 2 is a good choice, it's a rather complex source

1075
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
game.

1076
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,760
That's true, if you can get that on there, then that opens the door to a lot of other

1077
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
games.

1078
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:02,480
I want to go on to the next story, Loki, I want to, Wine actually stands for Wine is

1079
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
not an emulator.

1080
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,040
Yeah, I think I actually knew that, but I'm so far removed.

1081
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:07,720
10 years, just saying old age.

1082
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,720
Yeah.

1083
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,720
Alright.

1084
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,240
I want to go back to a comment that came up in chat earlier, because this is a very important

1085
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,200
clarification to something I had brought up a minute ago.

1086
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,680
Ospher in our chatroom says, for the Theatrhythm DLC for Somnus from Final Fantasy Versus 13,

1087
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,160
it labels the song as just from the Final Fantasy series, but not which one.

1088
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,680
Maybe that's a sign of the name change that they don't want to reveal yet.

1089
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,640
That is huge, that is a big deal, I think that's worth stating, so thank you for saying

1090
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,640
that, Ospher.

1091
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,400
I think that is, if they didn't label it as Versus 13, then yes, a name change is coming,

1092
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
or question mark, question mark.

1093
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
I think you're right.

1094
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
Very interesting.

1095
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,120
Alright, back to news, sorry, Loki.

1096
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:56,840
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Fez, and Fez had an issue with one of its

1097
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:03,760
recent patches, where not a lot of people, but some people were having issues with their

1098
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:11,960
save games being obliterated, and of course, because of that, Polytron pulled back the

1099
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:20,120
patch that they put out, and they were gonna release a second patch to fix that problem,

1100
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:27,280
however they said no, because it was gonna cost them $10,000 to get the game recertified

1101
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:33,840
by Microsoft, and so they're just saying, well, you know, if any players have an issue

1102
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:41,800
with the game, your save's being deleted since you're only like 1%, kinda tough luck, you're

1103
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,480
just gonna have to deal with it.

1104
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:50,520
So of course, they made the comment, you know, had Fez been released on Steam, we wouldn't

1105
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,160
have this issue, because updates are free.

1106
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:01,080
But I believe the designer of Fez said it's not a PC game, didn't want it on PCs, so...

1107
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,240
Exactly.

1108
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,440
And then they said no, well, does that mean a Steam version is in progress?

1109
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:12,480
Only a few months left for Xbox Live Arcade exclusivity, they said.

1110
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:18,400
Microsoft of course responded, saying, you know, that Polytron and their investors, Trapdoor,

1111
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,520
made the decision not to work on an additional title update for Fez.

1112
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:26,800
Microsoft Studios chose to support this decision based on the belief that Polytron slash Trapdoor

1113
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,840
were in the best position to determine what the acceptable quality level for their game

1114
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,040
is.

1115
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:38,000
And while we do not disclose the cost of title updates, we do offer, we did offer to work

1116
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,240
with Trapdoor and make sure that wasn't a blocking issue.

1117
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,860
We remain a huge fan of Fez.

1118
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:50,280
So I don't know if that means, okay, we're not gonna charge you 10,000, but we'll charge

1119
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,280
you 7,500.

1120
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
Discount!

1121
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,280
Discount.

1122
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,000
I mean, I don't really know what these issues...

1123
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,360
Apparently Microsoft patches are available in the Steam sale.

1124
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,360
But here's my thing.

1125
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:07,440
I mean, it's problems, first off, you know, it is closed system, so Microsoft can charge

1126
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,440
you whatever the hell you want.

1127
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,280
But when you make your game, you're well aware of what those costs are gonna be before you

1128
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,600
make your game.

1129
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,680
And they probably thought, okay, well that's no problem, we're not gonna have an issue

1130
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,680
with this stuff.

1131
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,980
But then some bugs went through, and so they released a patch, which obviously they did

1132
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,480
not test well enough.

1133
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,140
And if it's only having the 1% of the people at the time, see, I don't understand how a

1134
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:31,180
save game problem can only be having the 1% of the people, because that's, you're basically

1135
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,500
running on systems that are all the same.

1136
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,360
You know, I don't understand how it can affect one and not the other.

1137
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,760
But whatever.

1138
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:42,860
So they released a patch that they didn't test well enough, and now they're complaining

1139
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:48,320
that they would have to pay more money out of their pocket to, you know, fix the game.

1140
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,440
And I understand that this developer is not as big as, like, Activision, who releases

1141
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,560
like 13 goddamn patches for Call of Duty, and...

1142
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:00,280
But they were in Indie Movie the Game, surely they must be, er, Indie Game the Movie.

1143
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,280
Wow.

1144
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,920
They were in Indie Game the Movie, surely they must be rich.

1145
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:11,560
Well, I don't know if that's the case, but, you know, maybe $10,000 is too much.

1146
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:15,240
Maybe they're kind of like opportunity cost, we can either fix it for the 1%, but are we

1147
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,320
really gonna recruit this money in additional sales, or do we just leave it as it is, and

1148
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,520
hopefully it doesn't affect that many more people, and we'll just, you know, keep the

1149
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,520
money where we're at.

1150
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,260
I think that's kind of where they're at, is that they didn't want to spend the money.

1151
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,000
It's a tricky issue though, because like on one hand I'm like, wow, that's kind of fucked

1152
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,360
up of Microsoft to charge so much money, but on the other hand I'm like, well it also really

1153
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,920
encourages people to get it right the first time, so you can't blame them.

1154
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:43,340
As it is, games are patched left and right anyways, and, um, you know, I think that it's

1155
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:46,260
a good thing that they do charge that kind of money, because it does discourage them

1156
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,760
from like going, well fuck it, we didn't really test this game, so we're just gonna release

1157
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,720
it out there, we'll see what kind of bugs people run into, and then we'll go fix it.

1158
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,120
I should be able to get a refund when their game is buggy as hell.

1159
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,600
Although, granted, it's only affecting less than one, or whatever it is, 1% of people,

1160
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:07,600
but if I'm in that 1%, I should be able to get my money back, don't you think?

1161
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,160
You'd have to make the argument with Microsoft.

1162
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,520
Welcome to the world of digital distribution.

1163
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,400
Yeah.

1164
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,760
They just take customer service right on out of the picture.

1165
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:25,520
But to be fair, it's not necessarily Microsoft's fault that that game doesn't work.

1166
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,400
It's just being hosted on their servers, it's the developer and publisher that decided,

1167
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,280
hey, we don't want to pay money to fix this game, so you're gonna have to go ask them

1168
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,280
for your money back.

1169
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,720
Yeah, but it's on their system, it's only on their system, they kind of own it a little

1170
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,720
bit too.

1171
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
You know?

1172
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,720
I mean, whether they want to or not.

1173
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,720
But it's not their fault, though.

1174
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,720
I know.

1175
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:51,640
That's like saying, you know, oh, that game is, you know, this game is buggy, and just

1176
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:55,640
because it happens to be on Xbox 360, I'm gonna blame Microsoft for it.

1177
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,960
It doesn't make any sense, because they're just providing the system that it runs on.

1178
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,880
Their system's not causing the problem.

1179
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,520
At least I don't think it is.

1180
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:09,560
All right, well, let's move on to a different topic that apparently is causing a big problem

1181
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,760
in the iPad world, or iOS.

1182
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,400
But this particularly is for the iPad.

1183
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,060
And Alan, I'm pretty happy that Maruko in Sanrio, your cats, aren't into playing games

1184
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,060
on my iPad.

1185
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,060
Because apparently...

1186
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,060
They're too old.

1187
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,060
They don't care.

1188
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,060
They don't care anymore.

1189
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:30,400
Well, apparently, there is an iPad app out there called Games for Cats.

1190
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,040
It's an iPad game that is actually aimed at cats, you know, for them to, like, paw at

1191
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,040
the iPad.

1192
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,920
I would be worried about them scratching it up, but I guess it doesn't...

1193
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,400
Yeah, I'm incredibly against decline cats, because they actually remove, like, it's part

1194
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,400
of the bone.

1195
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Yeah.

1196
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,400
So you're taking off, like, half their finger.

1197
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,800
So I think that's wrong.

1198
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:53,120
But if you don't have a declawed cat, why is it pawing at your iPad?

1199
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,760
It costs, like, $800.

1200
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,760
What is wrong with you?

1201
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,720
I don't think the glass scratches that easy from cats scratching it.

1202
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,960
I mean, like, my cat scratches our LCD TV, and...

1203
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,880
I wouldn't want to take that chance, because I look at the sofa, and I'm like...

1204
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,960
Well, that's the sofa.

1205
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,440
That's where, you know, you've got material where the cat's claws are getting caught in.

1206
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,440
Cats have already...

1207
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,840
The cats have already fucked up the bed.

1208
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,840
I don't even...

1209
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,840
Yeah, but we're talking glass.

1210
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:19,280
We're talking glass that's meant to, you know, withstand, you know, quite a few scuffs.

1211
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,640
You know, obviously dropping it on something, or scraping it on something sharp, you know,

1212
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:24,640
might cause a scratch.

1213
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,640
But it's...

1214
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,720
The cat claws aren't strong enough to cause a lot of scratches.

1215
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,880
And there's folks in the chat saying they...

1216
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,760
Bobby Blackwolf says their claws don't scratch the screen.

1217
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
They've tested.

1218
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,760
Plus...

1219
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,760
I hear that.

1220
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,760
I just don't believe it.

1221
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,760
Plus the bottom of their feet.

1222
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,800
The bottom of their feet are nice and soft.

1223
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:43,040
So whatever scratches they put in there, they buff right out.

1224
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,040
So it's fun.

1225
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,400
Yeah, when a cat bats at something playfully, it doesn't have its claws out, but when it's

1226
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,720
trying to scratch, like when it's trying to fuck up a chair, it's trying to clean its

1227
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:54,720
claws on it.

1228
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,720
So yes, its claws are out.

1229
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,760
But it's not going to do that on an iPad.

1230
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,720
Unless they really hate Macs, or, you know, Apple.

1231
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,040
Well anyway, which maybe Sanrio hates Apple.

1232
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,560
I don't want her scratching the iPad.

1233
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:11,320
But anyway, all seriousness, back to the article.

1234
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,320
Games for Cats.

1235
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,480
It is an iPad game.

1236
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,800
It's, you know, of course, for cats.

1237
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,960
It, like everything else in the Apple world these days, has DLC.

1238
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,960
Double dippin'.

1239
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,960
Right?

1240
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,960
Charge you up front and then, hey, you want more levels for your cats?

1241
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,940
Ninety-nine cents for a new mouse level.

1242
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:29,940
What a surprise.

1243
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,840
But here's the real surprise.

1244
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,640
Cats bought it.

1245
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:42,900
Apparently, there's this epidemic where cats are inadvertently buying the DLC.

1246
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:49,640
And people are complaining that the design of the game fooled cats into buying it on

1247
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:50,640
purpose.

1248
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,040
Yeah, because there's probably some little mouse that says, buy more on it, that runs

1249
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,040
across the screen.

1250
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,480
And then the next one is, yes to check out.

1251
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:00,760
And that's it.

1252
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,800
You know, real hard stuff to code around.

1253
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,080
I thought that they had to put in passwords in order to get that stuff purchased.

1254
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,240
You can save those, apparently.

1255
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,960
Because I can't do that on my iPod.

1256
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,960
I have to, you know.

1257
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,560
No, you can save your password, so it never prompts you for that stuff.

1258
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,480
Well, then it's the fault of the owner.

1259
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,480
Well.

1260
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,160
And because you're buying games for your cat.

1261
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,120
Have you thought that maybe, you know, that's like a stupid thing?

1262
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:30,920
I'm gonna whip out my multi-hundred dollar device here so my cat can...

1263
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,520
Why is it stupid?

1264
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,960
We let our cats watch the TV.

1265
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,240
We, you know, why is it stupid?

1266
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,280
That's like, okay, this is basically like saying, hey, you know what, my cat likes the

1267
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,800
outdoors, I'm gonna buy it a car so it can drive down the street because it fucking likes

1268
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,800
the outdoors.

1269
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,800
Tootsies is real.

1270
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:52,720
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that I can see someone having a little

1271
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:57,280
swipe, you know, a little game visually for the cat on an iPad.

1272
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,280
That's fine.

1273
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,280
I can believe that.

1274
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,800
What I can't believe is someone going, hmm, Mittens was really into that game a week ago,

1275
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,040
but now she just doesn't care.

1276
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,600
I think she needs the DLC.

1277
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:12,200
I think she needs a new, a new, a new, a new stage for her to be interested in again.

1278
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:13,200
Yeah.

1279
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,080
No cats don't give a shit, right?

1280
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:21,120
I'm going to, yeah, for 99 cents you can get a shoestring and that will entertain your

1281
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,120
cat forever.

1282
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,320
The cat's not going to go, I already know how to chase the mouse on this maze.

1283
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:27,320
I need a new maze.

1284
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,640
She's just, I don't, she's not going to play anymore.

1285
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,940
These are cats that still chase laser pointers, even though like, you know, years and years

1286
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:37,220
and years of chasing it, they know they can't catch the fucking light, but they will still

1287
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,000
chase it because they're fucking stupid and they're like, I got to get that light.

1288
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I got to get the light.

1289
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
The light's delicious.

1290
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,760
Eat the light, light, light, chase the light, light.

1291
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,760
I'm going to get it.

1292
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,760
The light light.

1293
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,760
I got it.

1294
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:50,760
I got it.

1295
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:51,760
Oh damn it.

1296
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:52,760
It's on my paw.

1297
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Got it.

1298
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
Oh, so close.

1299
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Got it.

1300
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
Light light.

1301
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
Where'd it go?

1302
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,760
Where'd it go?

1303
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,760
Where'd it go?

1304
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,760
Where'd it go?

1305
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,760
Where'd it go?

1306
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,760
That can also be a dog too, by the way.

1307
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,760
Dogs do that.

1308
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,060
I used to love that cause like I'd played with the laser pointer with my dog and you'd see

1309
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,320
her just like twitching out for like an hour afterwards.

1310
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:12,160
Just like, what, what, what, what, what they're coming for me.

1311
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,160
Wait, wait.

1312
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,160
I put it right there.

1313
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,160
Where is it?

1314
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
All right.

1315
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:21,460
Uh, to answer the folks in chat hiccup is the company behind this game and an artist

1316
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:33,200
named TJ fuller, who did the artwork in games for cats said, quote, we got in a lot of trouble.

1317
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:38,660
So they have implemented a human check to fix the issue.

1318
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:45,260
You have to hold four fingers on touch points without moving them for a few seconds because

1319
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,560
the cat would never have that type of attention span to hold in four spots for a few seconds.

1320
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:58,080
Unless it's standing on top of the iPad.

1321
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,600
So just like you have to monitor your children when they're playing with the iPad, maybe

1322
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,900
you should monitor your cat because let's be real.

1323
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,120
You're not buying the app on the iPad for the cat's enjoyment.

1324
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,400
You're buying it for yours to watch the cat play it.

1325
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:19,680
Are you really get the cat away from you so they would stop bothering.

1326
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,440
Rama and chat says, this all reminds me of the Smurfs village fiasco.

1327
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,480
Yes, Rama.

1328
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,480
But those were children.

1329
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,480
This is a cat.

1330
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,480
It doesn't matter.

1331
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,760
They still have like 13 year olds.

1332
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,720
I didn't know that those Microsoft purchases were real money.

1333
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,720
Right.

1334
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
You didn't know that.

1335
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,720
Sure.

1336
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:43,360
Well, my, my fireworks are going, well, now you know who, what's the name of the really

1337
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:48,840
he's really old, uh, he's got the sunglasses, the fashion designer, Margaret show had a

1338
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,840
bit about him.

1339
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,440
Um, Carl Lagerfeld.

1340
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,520
Yes.

1341
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,880
His cat has a personal assistant and a Twitter and its own iPad.

1342
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,320
So let's put that out there.

1343
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,080
Carl Lagerfeld's cat has its own iPad.

1344
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:09,720
So that maybe that could be, you know, what have you done with your life?

1345
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,720
So that story, this story reminded me of that.

1346
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,720
Yeah.

1347
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,720
That's a real thing.

1348
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:14,920
What would you put on your resume?

1349
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:18,540
I, yeah, I w I was a personal assistant to this cat.

1350
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,040
That was my last, the cat fired me because I

1351
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:35,040
Toon says, the cat who could drive a car, he drives around all over the town, toon says,

1352
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,040
the cat who could drive a car.

1353
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,040
Don't just look at it.

1354
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,040
Let's be real.

1355
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:50,040
Toon says did a good thing by making sure Victoria Jackson was in that car.

1356
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,580
Agree.

1357
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,980
And poor Phil Hartman.

1358
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:54,980
Poor Phil Hartman.

1359
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:57,680
Rest in peace.

1360
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,220
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on vognetwork.com.

1361
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,040
Use the passphrase kitten.

1362
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,860
All right.

1363
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:07,860
Let's move on.

1364
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,860
Allen.

1365
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:09,860
Excuse me.

1366
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,500
I'm eating popcorn.

1367
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,900
So uh, what's going on?

1368
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:23,880
Sony is shutting down the online servers for two of its motor storm muddy truck games.

1369
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:28,320
Specifically its motor storm pacific rift, which came out in 2008.

1370
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,640
So that is four years old.

1371
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,000
And its PSP counterpart, motor storm arctic edge.

1372
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,720
So if you like to connect to PSN and do races, co-op or whatever with the matching service,

1373
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,240
that is all going away.

1374
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,880
As of, I think, October 1st.

1375
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,680
It's the last day, or I guess September 30th is the last day you have to enjoy that.

1376
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
October 1st.

1377
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,280
I'll give you a heads up.

1378
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,280
That was nice.

1379
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,160
Is there any of these games, online pass games or we know that's, we're not here.

1380
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:00,400
I didn't even get into it when I was bitching about mass effect three, by the way, I didn't

1381
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:05,120
even get into the online pass thing and how my $10 isn't paying for shit, but anyway,

1382
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,800
I'll just let that argument right itself, boys and girls, I just want to throw that

1383
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,520
out there, but I guess, yeah, it's a really short story.

1384
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,180
That's that's really it.

1385
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:21,160
Motorstorm Pacific Rift and Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is a PSP title, losing its Sony

1386
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,640
provided network while the machines are molding over anyway, so that one's not so bad, you

1387
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,640
know.

1388
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,280
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what

1389
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,880
games we can buy that will have their servers shut down in 2015.

1390
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,040
Well, I don't know if any of these games are going to have their servers shut down, but

1391
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,320
there is not really much coming out this week because it's kind of falling along the lines

1392
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:47,360
of July, the month with no game releases.

1393
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:53,620
But this week we do have, if you're feeling, you know, that you got to get in shape to

1394
01:13:53,620 --> 01:13:58,160
wear a bikini, you know, maybe not this year because you've procrastinated too long.

1395
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:06,120
But for next year, they've got the Adidas My Coach for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 move

1396
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,120
in.

1397
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,120
There's tons of preorders for that.

1398
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,520
Move and connect.

1399
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,880
That's coming out this week.

1400
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:18,080
Just on 3DS, you know, because there's actually people that were born well after that game

1401
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,580
came out.

1402
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:23,880
And Prototype 2 on PC finally making its way out.

1403
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:28,400
That was quite delayed.

1404
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,760
And then also I guess they have a move essential bundle for the PlayStation 3 with Just Dance

1405
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,240
3 thrown in there.

1406
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,120
All right.

1407
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,860
So that's it.

1408
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:43,240
Going to Japan this week in Japan.

1409
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,560
A couple more releases in Japan, but not a lot, but I know this one is extremely popular.

1410
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,200
Came up on the show a couple weeks ago.

1411
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:55,680
Persona 4, the ultimate in Mayanaka Arena, although remember that's the one that's region

1412
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,520
locked on PlayStation 3.

1413
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,800
It's also available on Xbox 360, which was always region locked.

1414
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,840
But that is out in Japan this week on July the 26th.

1415
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,840
Alice Madness Returns gets a price reduction on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1416
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:14,360
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Multi-Raid 2 HD version.

1417
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,160
That tells me this is a remake HD version.

1418
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,600
This is a remake of a title that was already out there.

1419
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,960
Trying to see if this is a game I recognize from here.

1420
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:28,860
It looks like, looks kind of like a Dynasty Warriors-esque game, but I don't think that's

1421
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:29,860
what it is.

1422
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:32,340
But like, you know, combo points and all that stuff.

1423
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,580
But it's HD version.

1424
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:41,120
Also coming out this week, the Super Dimension Fortress Macross Hybrid Pack, which I believe

1425
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,780
would mean it's the game and the Blu-ray making its way out in Japan this week.

1426
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,120
That's the 360 on the PlayStation 3.

1427
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,840
Let's take a look at the Vita real quick.

1428
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,200
Nothing really of note on the Vita this week.

1429
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,760
Some accessories, a new AC adapter, but that's not that exciting.

1430
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:03,180
So lastly on the 3DS this week, Cave Story 3D makes its way to Japan this week, as does

1431
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,720
a new pen in cobalt blue.

1432
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:06,720
Ooh-ah.

1433
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,720
That does it for Japanese releases.

1434
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,720
Alan, UK.

1435
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:15,680
UK and Europe, Prototype 2 on PC is coming out July 24th.

1436
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:23,000
July 25th, we have Wizorb, which I would recommend very much if you're into 16-bit retro sort

1437
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
of games.

1438
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,960
It's 2D, but it's an RPG Arkanoid Breakout mashup game.

1439
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,940
So it's got the Super NES graphics, and you're a little wizard playing Breakout, and it's

1440
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:32,940
really fun.

1441
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,940
You can have that on Steam.

1442
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:34,940
It's cute.

1443
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,940
Yeah.

1444
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:38,200
It's also, check out the Steam sale before it goes away, because I got it a couple days

1445
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,520
ago for like three bucks.

1446
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,120
And on the indie games for Xbox if you don't have that.

1447
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,120
Oh, nice.

1448
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:45,120
Yeah.

1449
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,960
So that's specifically on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PSP.

1450
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,760
Wizorb also on July 25th, Recettear, which is the game we were talking about earlier.

1451
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:01,720
July 27th, we have Inversion on PC, and Pokemon Conquest on DS, and then finally for this

1452
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:09,680
week on July 28th, Freaky Forms Deluxe Your Creations Alive, which is a very silly name.

1453
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:10,880
I don't know what that is.

1454
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,760
All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get into the classic game of

1455
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:16,760
the week.

1456
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,040
Dark Soccer may not be here to give a classic game out, but Salacious Pop will fill in,

1457
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,300
and we'll figure out what he picked in just a minute.

1458
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:24,800
For now, Loki.

1459
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,920
So this is kind of interesting.

1460
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:31,280
You may remember a few years ago, there was a class, I mean, there's always class action

1461
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:35,480
lawsuits when it comes to Madden and NCAA, but there's one that actually went to court,

1462
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,760
and they finally settled.

1463
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:45,520
So EA has reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that started in 2008 for $27

1464
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:46,840
million.

1465
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:54,280
Also part of that, they will not be able to renew their exclusive agreement with the NCAA,

1466
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,600
assuming that the court upholds that.

1467
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:04,800
And then of course, you know, because of that, those who were affected by it, who purchased

1468
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:18,200
a EA Sports NCAA game, will be entitled to anywhere from $6.79 per game on the GameCube,

1469
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:23,960
Xbox and Playstation 2, and $1.95 for the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3.

1470
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,560
And they're saying that also, EA has agreed to the stipulation on future license agreements

1471
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,680
as part of the proposed settlement.

1472
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,840
They will not make any exclusive licensing deals with the AFL for five years, and they

1473
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:40,040
will not renew their current agreement with the NCAA, and also they won't be able to enter

1474
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:46,120
another exclusive licensing agreement with the NCAA for five years.

1475
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:51,080
And the exclusive, I guess, well the trademarks for like the NFL and stuff are not affected

1476
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,000
by it because this is only the NCAA, but it's still interesting.

1477
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,400
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't follow sports titles as closely, you know, I think that's

1478
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,360
pretty obvious if you've listened to the show for a while, but obviously these are huge

1479
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,360
money games.

1480
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,240
I know EA's had a lot of, they've taken a lot of shit for their exclusive agreements

1481
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,280
in the past.

1482
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,000
This kind of seems like a big deal here.

1483
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,120
I mean, granted, the refunds that people get aren't that big a deal, although I heard that

1484
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:22,560
whatever people don't claim will go to child's play, which, that's great, but I'm talking

1485
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,320
more about the future, about how future licensing agreements work, that seems like it might

1486
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
be a big deal.

1487
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,480
Well, all it's going to mean is that they're not going to be exclusive, so they're still,

1488
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:35,600
I mean, this doesn't mean the NCAA football is going away anytime soon, it just means

1489
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,720
that there could be a version from 2K.

1490
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,160
That's huge, in my opinion, if 2K could do those.

1491
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:46,040
Well, I mean, remember they did all, was it, all pro football or something like that, it's

1492
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,160
sucked.

1493
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:53,800
Well, it sucked because it didn't have those licenses, so it didn't have as big of a budget.

1494
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,520
But it sucked as just a game, though.

1495
01:19:55,520 --> 01:20:00,120
I mean, not to say they couldn't pull something out, but I don't know.

1496
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:06,160
Then the other thing, too, is that this has to, they have to wait on approval from the

1497
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:10,440
court, which is going to happen on September 27th, so this is all, right now, the settlement,

1498
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:15,320
but the court has to say, okay, we agreed it, you know, the settlement's fine.

1499
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,240
So we'll just have to see what happens there.

1500
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:21,000
And we should say, again, the NFL trademark is not, it does not affect it.

1501
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,720
No, this does not affect Madden at all, so, um, but I just think it's funny, though, is

1502
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:28,920
that arena football is also, I mean, they haven't had an arena football game in forever.

1503
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,200
Although, I didn't remember, they did try that for a while, they had an arena football

1504
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,580
game for like two years.

1505
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,920
What about the XFL game?

1506
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,920
I'm just kidding.

1507
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,920
Hold on.

1508
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:38,920
Remember the XFL?

1509
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:39,920
Hold on.

1510
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,920
That was hilarious.

1511
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:47,120
You laugh, you laugh right now, but you know what league is considering a game, actually?

1512
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,640
Not necessarily EA publishing it, but there is a game coming for this league.

1513
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,640
Uh oh.

1514
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,000
The Lingerie Football League.

1515
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Fuck yeah.

1516
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,560
I'm telling you, that's a real thing.

1517
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,400
I might play that.

1518
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,400
That sounds awesome.

1519
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,080
You know the problem with those Lingerie Football Leagues and stuff like that?

1520
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:13,600
It's, I mean, the people watch it because they're hoping that, like, a top gets ripped

1521
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,600
off.

1522
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,600
It never fucking happens.

1523
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,720
So, cause, so that's my problem, it's not adult enough, you know?

1524
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,160
We need an adult game.

1525
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:24,400
I need an adult.

1526
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,280
There's only so much plausible deniability on why you're watching it before it's like,

1527
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,080
I could have looked at so much porn in the time that I've been watching this.

1528
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,080
I'm watching-

1529
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,480
Like, I'm just gonna take it that next step further.

1530
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,320
I'm watching this because I think they play really good football.

1531
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,400
No, no one's believing that.

1532
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,960
Yeah, so you're reading it for the articles.

1533
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,960
Yes, of course.

1534
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,200
I'm watching this for the articles.

1535
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,920
You know, you know what would make, you know, getting away from, you know, sexy women for

1536
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:48,920
a minute, you know what?

1537
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,040
They should license into a game.

1538
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,040
Puppy Bowl.

1539
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Yep.

1540
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,040
They've already done that because-

1541
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,040
Get out.

1542
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,040
No, no, it's not Puppy Bowl.

1543
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,480
But remember, there was, um, the, god, who was it?

1544
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,840
It wasn't Joe Montana.

1545
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:03,560
It was Jerry Rice Dog Football.

1546
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,680
It came out on the Wii last year, about a year ago, actually, because I remember-

1547
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:09,680
Okay.

1548
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,360
Well, the problem is that was Joe Montana, who's kind of, you know, he's long-

1549
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,360
It's Jerry Rice.

1550
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,360
Oh, sorry.

1551
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:20,960
Well, Jerry Rice also kind of, you know, it's, it's not that hot ass ref that they had on

1552
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,680
the Puppy Bowl the past couple years.

1553
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,680
Not this year.

1554
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,680
And really, you know why I failed?

1555
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,680
No kit in halftime.

1556
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,680
So that-

1557
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:28,680
Good point.

1558
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,680
Good point.

1559
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:33,760
Yeah, that night, his dog football was the, uh, game.

1560
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,280
The talk about, you know, chicks and football and all this has me thinking about one of

1561
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,360
my good friends, and, you know, I follow her on Facebook and all this.

1562
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,280
She's getting really into roller derby lately.

1563
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,400
Are there any good roller derby experiences on consoles?

1564
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:50,960
You know, I want to say, I thought there was a roller derby game, but, uh, probably not.

1565
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,080
I don't think there is a roller derby game.

1566
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,080
Which is sad.

1567
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,520
I mean, perhaps-

1568
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,400
There's quite a roller derby audience, though.

1569
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,280
She's got like a trading card and everything.

1570
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,280
Perhaps.

1571
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,280
Pretty cool.

1572
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:07,240
You know, they will come out with one because, um, you know, there was, uh, there's been

1573
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:16,320
plenty of games for, like, um, what was it, uh, uh, for lacrosse and, like, for rugby

1574
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,960
and that kind of stuff, so maybe we'll see that.

1575
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,920
Um, I am seeing, though, there is, uh, yeah, Jam City Roller Girls was actually a game

1576
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,120
that came out.

1577
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,120
Oh, okay.

1578
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:31,480
Um, it was on, I think, the Wii?

1579
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:36,240
Stan in our chat room says, you mean Asuka, who was, um, you know, she was the girl that

1580
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,000
was on the tester who was on the show about, what, six months ago at this point?

1581
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,840
Um, I follow her on Twitter, but not Facebook, and I forgot, she does roller derby, too,

1582
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:45,840
that's right.

1583
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,200
No, this is a different friend I'm thinking of, but-

1584
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,200
Yes, WiiWare.

1585
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,920
It was on WiiWare, Jam City Roller Girls is, it is an authentic, um, well, I don't know

1586
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,200
how authentic, but it is a roller derby game, so, uh, they do have one.

1587
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,680
All right.

1588
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:01,680
There's one.

1589
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,920
Which is, you know, they should have more than one.

1590
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:04,920
It looks decent.

1591
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,320
All right, let me move on.

1592
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,320
I gotta go to this.

1593
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,320
This is-

1594
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:16,200
Oh, God, I just, I'm just gonna put this out there, and Alan, I'll wait for you to make

1595
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,360
some smart-ass comments so you get ready, okay?

1596
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,840
I don't even really want to plug the website by saying its name, but I'm gonna have to

1597
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,280
too, so I want to just preface this by saying I ain't endorsing this shit, I just have to

1598
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,800
report on how ludicrous it is, all right?

1599
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:36,200
Um, there is a new website out there, and it's basically, from what it sounds like,

1600
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,600
it's kind of like adult friend finder, but for gamers.

1601
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,040
And it's called Shagga Gamer.

1602
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,600
It's launched in the United Kingdom.

1603
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,600
Sorry.

1604
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,600
Really?

1605
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
That's-

1606
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,600
Sorry, yes.

1607
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,320
I can't imagine that's in the United Kingdom with it being called Shagga Gamer, because

1608
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,960
I don't believe anybody uses the phrase Shag.

1609
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:55,480
Yes, they do.

1610
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,240
Every time they see Austin Powers, they want to see Shagga Gamer.

1611
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,680
Yes, Austin Powers, featuring a British spy.

1612
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,440
Yeah, baby!

1613
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:11,960
Wow, that's current, that's some current stuff there, current material you got working there.

1614
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:18,880
Austin Powers, a franchise that hasn't been around for years now.

1615
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,680
It is what they're calling the number one adult site for gamers.

1616
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,480
Of course they're calling it, yeah, we're number one.

1617
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,600
Well, who's their competition?

1618
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
Exactly.

1619
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,440
Who cares, I mean-

1620
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:38,640
They're offering their services to thousands of single gamers who want nothing more than

1621
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,240
a quick shag.

1622
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,120
Yeah, baby.

1623
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:50,800
For just 19.99 pounds a month, you get full access, this is a quote, quote, full access

1624
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:58,160
to young, old, exciting, sexy individuals wanting no strings sex.

1625
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,640
They're apparently coming soon as a Shagga Gamer TV as well.

1626
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:09,520
No, no, I do want to say, and this is important in their quote, they do not mention female

1627
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,520
gamers.

1628
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,840
She needs to be all dudes.

1629
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:20,600
So technically, yes, there are young, old gamers that want to have sex with no strings

1630
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,920
attached, but they're all dudes.

1631
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:29,720
The site continues, quote, quite simply, we are the best at matchmaking thousands of gamers.

1632
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:35,240
We are the same people behind Data Gamer, and we are the UK's biggest destination for

1633
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,300
single gamers and geeks.

1634
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:43,000
So when users are looking for a site to find the hottest gamer girls or the biggest number

1635
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,320
of gamers, that's why we are many people's number one choice.

1636
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:54,360
Now, it should be said that you can follow Shagga Gamer on Twitter, and out of all those

1637
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:03,080
thousands of people that are hooking up, they have 56 followers on their Twitter.

1638
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:08,280
I believe the OLR Twitter has something like 700 or 800 followers.

1639
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,480
So would it be fair to say that if suddenly we said, you know what, we don't want to be

1640
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,680
just an internet radio show anymore.

1641
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:17,260
We want to be a place for casual gamers to find a fuck.

1642
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:21,520
We would be able to say now we are the number one company.

1643
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:24,040
So suck it, Shagga Gamer.

1644
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,040
There's a problem with that.

1645
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,640
I don't give a fuck, so.

1646
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,680
Alan?

1647
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:35,120
This just makes me curious as to how many hookups happen at like E3 or PAX.

1648
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:36,640
Like do people get laid at those cons?

1649
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,640
I'm sure that PAX.

1650
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,640
Oh, sure they do.

1651
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:43,040
PAX, they actually, there's been articles where people will post Craigslist articles

1652
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:48,700
or notifications, it's a meetup for an orgy, basically, at PAX, and they will do that.

1653
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,160
So yes, they do that.

1654
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,400
And anime cons, and I mean there's a lot of like geek sex going on, but.

1655
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,800
Anything with a furry crossover, then yes, obviously.

1656
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,800
Dragon Con?

1657
01:27:58,800 --> 01:27:59,800
Yeah.

1658
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:00,800
I mean, but.

1659
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:02,520
Why do you think all the guys from VoG are going?

1660
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,520
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1661
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:08,160
I don't mean stuff that's set up like that on Craigslist, but just, oh hey, I see you

1662
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,160
at the Nintendogs.

1663
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,280
Oh, I'm in that hotel too.

1664
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,280
Room four?

1665
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,280
I got some wine.

1666
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:19,080
You know, they have a phrase for a reason, you know, a fool is money, you're easily parted.

1667
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,700
Don't be a sucker.

1668
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:24,960
Obviously there are not sites like this that are, there's just tons of hot gamer girls

1669
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,740
just waiting around for someone to just fuck them.

1670
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:33,640
Why aren't there any guys who the fuck me me misses attractive gaming loving girl with

1671
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,640
big titties?

1672
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:38,400
I'm sorry, that does not exist anywhere.

1673
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:43,200
So what, you know, all these sites that want to charge you money and stuff like that.

1674
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,320
Like for example, there's a perfect, what was it, remember the gaming one where you

1675
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:52,200
would join up and you'd play, you play games with hot gaming girls and stuff like that,

1676
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:58,640
and they would, you know, have video cam time with you and, um, they may undress somewhat

1677
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:01,120
when you're playing the old battleship or something.

1678
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:05,200
I don't know, Alan, I might shag that gamer.

1679
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:11,760
That image on their splash page is hilarious because I can't tell if it's just a really

1680
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:17,120
cheap stock image photo that they just photoshopped those shaggy gamer thing on his shirt or if

1681
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,120
that's an actual photo shoot.

1682
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,120
No, cause she has it too.

1683
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,120
She has it too.

1684
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,120
Yeah, I could shop that.

1685
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,120
That would be hard.

1686
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:27,520
That's a photo shoot that they had about as hard as that might be right there.

1687
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,520
What am I pointing at?

1688
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,520
Ellen?

1689
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,520
I know.

1690
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,520
Look how well defined that is.

1691
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:32,520
She's, she's lifting his shirt.

1692
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,520
Yeah.

1693
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,360
I think that's a photo shot at his junk, I guess, but you don't need to lift his shirts.

1694
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,840
I don't know what's going on in that picture, but then they show some of the actual users

1695
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,240
of the site and like, you know, Paula 25 she's waiting to get shagged.

1696
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:48,560
I'm sorry.

1697
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,560
Okay.

1698
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:55,880
Here's my question though.

1699
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,000
What is so gamer about this?

1700
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,640
I mean, is it like, you know, you want someone to fuck and then cuddle and play Skyrim with

1701
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:08,520
after, like, can't you just go on OkCupid and set gamer tags as your match?

1702
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:11,320
Like only show me people that have this filter.

1703
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,320
That's what I'm thinking.

1704
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,320
Yes, exactly.

1705
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,320
You can do that.

1706
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,720
Or there's even if you're looking to date somebody, there's even that geek to geek site,

1707
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,240
which I hear is okay.

1708
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:25,300
But you're better off, you know, with something like, you know, like an OkCupid or plenty

1709
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:30,380
of fish or something like that, where it doesn't really cost you anything to do it because

1710
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:34,280
these sites, they basically, oh yeah, it's free to sign up, free to sign up.

1711
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,440
And then you sign up and then you're like, oh, I want to talk to this person.

1712
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,000
I want to send them a message saying, yes, I would like to fuck you.

1713
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1714
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,680
That's going to cost you money.

1715
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,240
You're not a premium member.

1716
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,680
And then you become a premium member.

1717
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:50,080
So, uh, sorry, you're not blah, blah, blah.

1718
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,840
You need more money to do this.

1719
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:52,840
They put it this way.

1720
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:53,840
You know what?

1721
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,280
These people that they have, the models that they have here are not on their fucking site.

1722
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,280
Okay.

1723
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,280
Well, you know what they might do?

1724
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,120
I bet, and I bet a lot of websites like this do this.

1725
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,720
They probably partner with another site.

1726
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,000
Like the women probably didn't sign up for the site.

1727
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,860
The women signed up for some other site and the women signed up for a site that was like,

1728
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,080
find a nerdy guy or find a rich guy or something like that.

1729
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,320
Cause you know, all nerds are rich like, and I bet that's what it is.

1730
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,080
They do something to lure the women in and there's something really tiny, really tiny

1731
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:28,280
in the terms of agreement that is, Oh, your picture and profile may show up on our partner

1732
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,880
websites.

1733
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:35,500
So some of these women probably sign up for, you know, just, you know, fuck me and leave

1734
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,960
me.com or whatever.

1735
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,360
I don't know.

1736
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,720
And suddenly they're on Shagga gamer.

1737
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:41,720
I don't know.

1738
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:42,720
All right.

1739
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,160
I think we spent far too much time on this topic.

1740
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,160
Yeah.

1741
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:49,160
Just don't give them your time.

1742
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,880
I mean, that's basically the moral of the story.

1743
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,680
Go to Craigslist, but be careful.

1744
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,880
Like there's some real freaky people on Craigslist.

1745
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:04,240
Craigslist is just weird.

1746
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:07,400
Let's go to a time when games were a lot simpler.

1747
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:18,280
Back when we were innocent and we weren't thinking about such pervert things, the classic

1748
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,240
game of the week, every week, dark Sakura goes into the vault and finds a classic game

1749
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:28,760
that she deems worthy of you to revisit all over again.

1750
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:36,440
But since she's at a wedding, Alan's here and he dug into the shoebox to find the classic

1751
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,440
game that he thinks you all should play this week.

1752
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:44,320
Alan was the classic game of the week, classic game of the week is a Lucas arts game on the

1753
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,760
scum engine came out in 1993.

1754
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:49,680
It is maniac mansion day of the tentacle.

1755
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:50,680
Good pick.

1756
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,720
Got any audio for me?

1757
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:56,280
I'm getting some up right now.

1758
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:02,480
Oh, this amazing intro.

1759
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:08,360
So yes, this is the sequel to a previous classic game of the week, maniac mansion, which came

1760
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,980
out in 1987.

1761
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:15,240
You play Bernard, who was one of the cast members of the first game.

1762
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:24,000
You are called back to the mansion by totally blanking on his name, Dr. Fred, because the

1763
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,440
purple tentacle has drank some toxic sludge that made him super smart and he's going to

1764
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:35,120
take over the world, so you and your two friends have to go back in time to prevent him from

1765
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,440
drinking the slime and becoming super smart, but something goes horribly wrong with the

1766
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:47,880
time machines that are made out of porta potties, they're modified porta potties.

1767
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:57,880
Listen to the audio.

1768
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:05,240
The main directors of this game were Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, who had worked on the adventures

1769
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:10,500
of monkey island games, and they got their pedigree from that and Lucas Arts said, okay,

1770
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:14,280
you guys are going to helm this game and it's the sequel to maniac mansion.

1771
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,200
It's point and click style.

1772
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:23,940
They fixed the engine that they used in this for Sam and Max Hit the Road, which was the

1773
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:30,440
other game I was debating using tonight, but yeah, so you've got give, pick up, use, push,

1774
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:34,420
look at, open, and you just click that, you click on your verb and then you click on what

1775
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,000
you want and you interact with the puzzles that way.

1776
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:43,560
Bernard stays in present day, his sort of overweight rocker friend, very hair metal.

1777
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:49,000
Hoagie goes into the future and then she's kind of a Daria Morgendorfer, Ally Sheedy

1778
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,820
in the Breakfast Club, kind of spazzy girl.

1779
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:58,280
She goes back in time to the colonial ages, or do I have that backwards, I forget.

1780
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,280
She goes to the future, Hoagie goes to the past, that's right, sorry, I haven't played

1781
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:05,980
this game in years, but it's super awesome.

1782
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:10,480
They went and looked at a bunch of Warner Brothers cartoons for the visual, like how

1783
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:14,240
they wanted to do the art direction, and also a lot of the sound effects are taken directly

1784
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,480
from the cartoons as well.

1785
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:22,560
And yeah, it's got Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are some of the cameos that Hoagie

1786
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:30,420
has to deal with in the past, and it has a great endgame when it all comes together and

1787
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:34,480
all the three characters are joined again, it's just a lot of fun.

1788
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:40,000
This game also was one of the first few CD games, for one it was a computer game that

1789
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,440
came out on CD-ROM and also had full voice acting, which at the time, I think, King's

1790
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:50,300
Quest V, the Sierra game which came out I think in 91 also had voice acting, but a lot

1791
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,680
of it was really bad.

1792
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:58,080
The voice acting in these LucasArts games, even though for the early 90s, are phenomenal.

1793
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:02,000
Amazing voice acting considering that it was new technology, because when this came out

1794
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,160
on PC and PC were just getting talky video games, we were playing the Super Nintendo

1795
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,960
for about a year or two, because that came out in 91 to just show the timeline of how

1796
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,060
the technology was.

1797
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:21,220
But yeah, I actually installed, I still have this, I have the original instruction booklet

1798
01:36:21,220 --> 01:36:25,600
and the disc, and I installed DOSBox on my Windows 7 machine so I could play this in

1799
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,600
Sam & Max.

1800
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,440
Does this come on LucasArts' pack that's on Steam?

1801
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:34,000
Good old games has it, I want to say.

1802
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I don't know about Steam.

1803
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,160
I remember there was some type of LucasArts mega pack of adventure games it was on, that's

1804
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:42,440
how you could get Loom and shit.

1805
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:47,480
And for people who are into emulators, DOSBox is just, you still need the game with DOSBox,

1806
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:51,920
but if you have SCUM, SCUM is also an emulator specifically for LucasArts games that run

1807
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,920
on this engine.

1808
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:56,480
ActDeft clarifies, nope, it isn't on Steam at all.

1809
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,000
So it is not a part of that pack, go figure.

1810
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,960
Also some other comments on this game, Burr says, Day of the Tentacle is the best adventure

1811
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,600
game ever.

1812
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:10,080
Dungeon Buster says, this was LucasArts at the height of Awesome 2.

1813
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:14,200
This and Sam & Max, I don't want to try to put one over the other, but both of those

1814
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:21,640
games together are just phenomenal adventure games for that era of PC gaming.

1815
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:25,360
Anything else you want to say about Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle?

1816
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,360
Uh, hilarious.

1817
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:31,520
One of the funniest games they've ever played aside from Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity,

1818
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:36,000
which I'm sorry, my judge wrote the script, it's a hilarious game.

1819
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,520
You'll have to pick that next time.

1820
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:49,480
And I want to say, I'm trying to find the actual site for this rumor, but I think it

1821
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:57,640
might be Telltale Games, but someone somewhere wants to put out an episodic franchise that

1822
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:01,240
exists in the same universe that references Day of the Tentacle.

1823
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:05,300
I could see that, because as much as people loved this game, nothing ever really came

1824
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:06,300
after it, you know?

1825
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,640
Yeah, no, Maniac Mansion 3, do you think we'd get?

1826
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:13,040
Well, LucasArts has been all about, literally, Star Wars games, for what?

1827
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:16,360
Pretty much since, once this era ended, they've just been about Star Wars, really.

1828
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:21,480
And Grim Fandango was their last big splash in PC adventure games.

1829
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:24,960
But yeah, super awesome, people should check it out.

1830
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,560
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Maniac Mansion 2, Day of the Tentacle,

1831
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:31,880
or just Day of the Tentacle for short.

1832
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,240
Thank you, Alan, good pick.

1833
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,280
A good PC adventure game.

1834
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:39,160
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys, we have plenty more

1835
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:44,800
show when we come back, including rapid fire news, and we're gonna revisit Xbox security

1836
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,800
again.

1837
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,880
But this time, it might not be as much ranting as it's been in the past.

1838
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:59,640
We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1839
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:05,720
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on Sunday, July the 22nd of 2012,

1840
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,600
with episode number 466 of our show.

1841
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:14,080
DarkSakura, not here tonight, she is at a wedding in Las Vegas, the wedding of Tiara

1842
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:20,240
and Dan from Geek-Life.com, and we want to, once again, wish them a very happy wedding.

1843
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:25,040
I see the pictures are starting to show up on Facebook, and all I can say is, aw.

1844
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:32,080
Alright, I promised a giveaway here in part B, and again, this is a code generously donated

1845
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:36,960
to the show by Bashka, and you can visit his website, critcraft.blogspot.com, if you like

1846
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,120
World of Warcraft stuff.

1847
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,360
Even if you don't, he tends to have some, you know, some other little gaming things

1848
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,080
that sneak in there, too, and the types of stuff that a lot of OLR people, I bet, would

1849
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,840
be really into.

1850
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,760
What we are giving away, once again, it is a beta key for Ravaged.

1851
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:58,440
This is, I can play this little gameplay trailer here that he sent me there on the Facebooks.

1852
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,760
I guess there's some gameplay in this trailer here.

1853
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:07,120
It's a first-person shooter that is set in a world ravaged by a polar shift pitting scavengers

1854
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:14,200
versus the resistance, so as soon as this ad finishes playing, I'll play a little clip

1855
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:17,680
of the gameplay trailer, and we're going to give this away right now to somebody that

1856
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:23,880
is checked in at vognetwork.com and in our chat room, and of course, wants the code,

1857
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,200
because I'm going to send them a private message and be like, are you going to use this code?

1858
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:32,200
And if they, uh, they don't, then I'll give away to somebody else.

1859
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,200
I remember this one.

1860
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,200
Yeah, it looks like a lot.

1861
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,200
This is the game that was supposed to be like Rage, you know, how Rage is supposed to be.

1862
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:41,800
It's, you know, like fighting and bugging.

1863
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:46,160
Lots of like, do-buggies, planes, that type of stuff.

1864
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,280
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

1865
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,880
Might want a pretty decent computer in order to play this.

1866
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,280
All right, let's see who we're going to give that away to.

1867
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,240
We're going to do this live right now.

1868
01:40:57,240 --> 01:41:00,940
What I'm doing right now, I'm pulling up the list of people that are currently checked

1869
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,440
into the show.

1870
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:08,120
All right, so I need you, Loki, you checked in.

1871
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:09,320
Are you trying to win this too?

1872
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,320
No, I'm just checking all the time.

1873
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,760
All right, pick a number between one and 30.

1874
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:17,160
Uh, Alan, pick a number between one and 30.

1875
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,160
23.

1876
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:19,160
23.

1877
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:20,160
So that's 31-39-87-6543.

1878
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:29,200
I want to see if that person is in chat right now.

1879
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:32,200
Hopefully they have a similar name or I might not be able to identify them.

1880
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,800
I think you can just Google a random number generator and put in the one to 30.

1881
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,120
It's more fun if I ask you.

1882
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:44,560
Uh, I'm looking, I don't see that person in chat right now.

1883
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,040
Looking one more time.

1884
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,360
Just making sure.

1885
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,960
Okay, yeah, that person isn't in chat right now.

1886
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:52,960
So give me another number.

1887
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:53,960
12.

1888
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:54,960
12.

1889
01:41:54,960 --> 01:42:00,680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

1890
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:03,440
I'm pretty sure this person is in chat.

1891
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:04,720
It's Raginator.

1892
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:09,080
Let me see if he wants it.

1893
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:16,400
Okay, I'll let you guys know in a minute if Raginator is going to take the code or if

1894
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,880
somebody else will walk away with it.

1895
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,160
So I just sent him a private message.

1896
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,520
All right, let's move on in the meantime to rapid fire news.

1897
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,520
Loki.

1898
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:26,520
All right.

1899
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:31,120
So, um, as I mentioned, I was playing a game called, uh, you know, I want to be the guy

1900
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:35,160
Gaiden, uh, that's finally been released now, so you can check it out.

1901
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,200
It's a little buggy.

1902
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:41,420
It's just the first of a few episodic games that are going to be put out, but I mean,

1903
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,240
it's pretty hard, so it'll have to do.

1904
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:50,600
It's three levels long and you can check it out on, um, GameJolt has it, uh, so just go

1905
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:55,560
to GameJolt.com and look in their freeware section and they've got, you know, I want

1906
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,160
to be the guy Gaiden.

1907
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,560
It's pretty easy to find.

1908
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:06,940
Or you can go to, uh, Kaylin's, uh, or can site, uh, K A Y I N dot P Y O K O, uh, dot

1909
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:12,480
org slash I W B T G. I want to be the guy.

1910
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,800
So there you go.

1911
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,320
You can find all the information on that and it's pretty cool.

1912
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:17,600
So check it out.

1913
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,480
Um, this is kind of funny.

1914
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:23,880
You know, the game, uh, Tokyo jungle, the one that's basically a bunch of animals surviving

1915
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,680
in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo.

1916
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:27,160
It looked awesome.

1917
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,160
It looked awesome.

1918
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,680
Well, they're even making it a little, uh, stranger.

1919
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:36,640
They're adding Japanese businessmen to the game.

1920
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:43,680
There's DLC that's, uh, coming out that you can play as a salary man and you can, uh,

1921
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,160
well, businessman can be pretty Savage too.

1922
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,160
Let's be real.

1923
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:51,360
So you can play the game and God, I hope you don't have to mate them.

1924
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:52,360
That's going to be weird.

1925
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:55,400
Uh, but yes, so I'll be coming out.

1926
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:58,200
I'm looking forward to the game when it finally makes it over here.

1927
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:02,720
Uh, act deft and chat says, isn't it being localized for the U S yes, yes it is.

1928
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:03,720
It is.

1929
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:07,760
Uh, Ray dear at a live.vog network.com says, I want to be the guy.

1930
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,760
Damn it.

1931
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:12,920
I'm sure that's what a lot of people say playing that game.

1932
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:19,080
And then finally Manos, the hands of fate is coming out on iOS.

1933
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:25,120
They're making an eight bit type game for it and it is a 2d platform or it's a very

1934
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:30,940
retro and maybe we'll be on other platforms other than iOS at some point, but of course

1935
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:35,960
has all the, you know, infamous stuff from the series.

1936
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,840
And if you're not familiar with Manos stands of fate, but it's one of the worst movies

1937
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:44,160
ever made, you know, how bad is it?

1938
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,160
It's pretty bad.

1939
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:49,680
I've fallen asleep twice with trying to watch it once, uh, both times with, uh, mr.

1940
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:50,680
Sand, Seager 3000.

1941
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:51,680
Oh wow.

1942
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:52,680
And it was still bad.

1943
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:55,200
It was still so bad that I fell asleep.

1944
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:59,400
All right, well, let's move on to some other stories.

1945
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:02,240
First up, rock band blitz finally has a release date.

1946
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:05,960
Uh, they said it would come out this summer and we're already about halfway through summer.

1947
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:12,600
Well, we finally have a date for at PlayStation, August 28th, X-Box live, uh, a day later,

1948
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:19,040
August 29th, that's going to cost you 15 bucks for this game and some more songs were revealed

1949
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,040
for the game.

1950
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,040
We'll, that will be in the game.

1951
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:25,920
Cool and the gang's jungle boogie, my chemical romances sing funds.

1952
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,920
We are young.

1953
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:32,040
And that's like the song that won't go away off the radio at all, um, Avenged Sevenfold

1954
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,820
so far away also there.

1955
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,840
And a lot of people very excited about this.

1956
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,800
It uses all the DLC from rock band that you might have built up on your hard drive.

1957
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,840
And if you're like me, you have a lot.

1958
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,560
So it's pretty cool that you'll be able to use this in the game as well.

1959
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:48,960
Very cool.

1960
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:55,320
Uh, now, uh, Portal 2, if you've beaten Portal 2, then the joke, I'm in space, makes sense

1961
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,320
to you.

1962
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,520
If not, welp, sorry, I'm not going to spoil you, you'll just have to go back and beat

1963
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,520
it.

1964
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,160
But what's kind of funny is that things are about to get really meta because NASA is going

1965
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,920
to send Portal 2 to space.

1966
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:06,920
That's right.

1967
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:13,080
An anonymous tech at NASA laser engraved the space core on a part that is going to be flying

1968
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,560
on a resupply craft to the International Space Station.

1969
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,040
Valve posted about it on their official Portal blog on Friday.

1970
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,960
Uh, they don't know who did it.

1971
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:24,160
It was an anonymous tech at NASA.

1972
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:29,900
NASA did not endorse this, but it's happening because they actually laser engraved this

1973
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,520
little Wheatley in space.

1974
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:35,520
It's not Wheatley, it's a core.

1975
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,200
Yeah, it's a space core.

1976
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:38,920
It's the one that's in the Skyrim thing.

1977
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:39,920
Space.

1978
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,920
Space.

1979
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:41,920
Space.

1980
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:42,920
Space.

1981
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:43,920
Space.

1982
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,920
What is that Wheatley at the end of the game?

1983
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:45,920
He eventually went in the space.

1984
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:46,920
Oh, okay.

1985
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:48,240
He was all emo about it.

1986
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,240
All right, whatever.

1987
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:50,240
Oh, that's right.

1988
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:51,240
Okay.

1989
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,240
Yeah, right.

1990
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,240
I'm okay.

1991
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:54,240
Yeah.

1992
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,240
Wheatley's emo about it.

1993
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,240
And then there's the other guy in the background.

1994
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,240
Yeah.

1995
01:46:57,240 --> 01:46:58,240
Yeah.

1996
01:46:58,240 --> 01:46:59,240
Yeah.

1997
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:00,240
It's been a little while since I beat Portal 2.

1998
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,240
I beat it when it first came out.

1999
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,240
So anyhow.

2000
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,240
And if you're going to kill me because I gave a little spoiler there, you know what?

2001
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,680
Game's been out a year and it's been on sale for like five bucks lately.

2002
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:09,760
So I'm thinking you haven't played it at this point.

2003
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:15,600
Um, also lastly, uh, EA gets a lot of hate.

2004
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:17,560
But they did something that's pretty cool this week.

2005
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:23,280
Um, they joined Microsoft, Viacom, Google, Zynga, another company gets a lot of hate,

2006
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,720
and eBay on this that's pretty cool.

2007
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:31,660
It is a amicus brief that declares opposition to DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which

2008
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:34,820
legally defines marriage between a man and a woman.

2009
01:47:34,820 --> 01:47:39,380
And EA in a press release said, quote, DOMA presents a number of problems for businesses

2010
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:45,020
like EA as it creates regulatory tax and discrimination complications for employers.

2011
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:46,840
And that's why we're standing against it.

2012
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:51,240
The underlying lawsuit impacts all employers, no matter how big or small, and no matter

2013
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,240
the industry.

2014
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:55,480
And we encourage other businesses to join these efforts.

2015
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:56,480
And that's pretty cool.

2016
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,960
EA's, um, been pretty supportive of LGBT causes in the past.

2017
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:04,000
They actually marched in the Pride Parade in San Francisco and in Seattle.

2018
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,840
They've done their own It Gets Better campaign video that's available on YouTube as well.

2019
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:13,860
So a little less evil doing the right thing and standing against DOMA, which obviously

2020
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:17,580
we here at OLR also think is kind of crap.

2021
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:22,720
So let's move on with some more stories.

2022
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:29,520
The Los Angeles comedy club Laugh Factory, which is world famous, I think the first stand-up

2023
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:36,060
comedian that ever performed there was Richard Pryor, Dave Chappelle, and has done like six

2024
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:37,240
hour sets there.

2025
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:38,840
So yes, world famous.

2026
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:41,720
They have a charity to help kids and all this stuff.

2027
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:48,840
They are coming out with a streaming channel for PS3 on PlayStation Network, PS3 only from

2028
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,840
this story.

2029
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,560
$3 a month if you're a stand-up comedy nerd like myself and you listen to stand-up comic

2030
01:48:54,560 --> 01:49:00,040
podcasts like Greg Proops and Aisha Tyler like I do, you might like this.

2031
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:05,400
I know stand-up comedy isn't really as relevant now as it was in the 90s, but yeah, Laugh

2032
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:09,040
Factory, Los Angeles Club, $3 a month.

2033
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:12,520
Both pre-recorded and live performances from stand-ups.

2034
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:18,440
No real schedule yet on the content, but if you're a comedy nerd, you've got $3 a month

2035
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,440
to burn.

2036
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,440
It's kind of neat.

2037
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,440
Something different.

2038
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,440
Yeah.

2039
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:25,080
Although you can get it for free through some of those other podcasts you mentioned.

2040
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:26,080
Yeah.

2041
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,080
Well that's, yeah.

2042
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:34,360
And then also the Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio, very funky, amazing cell shaded game

2043
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:43,480
is coming to iOS and Android this summer to compliment the PC and Vita versions.

2044
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:49,280
So I remember the Dreamcast one, the original, and it was an amazing game.

2045
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,420
It eventually got too hard for me to like, I think by the time I unlocked the fourth

2046
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,880
or fifth character, it just got so hard I couldn't do it anymore.

2047
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:04,120
The learning curve for the controls was when you got it, you got it, but it took a while.

2048
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:08,720
I cannot imagine how this is going to play on a touch screen unless they really tweak

2049
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,720
the controls.

2050
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:16,760
But yeah, funky Jet Set Radio goodness coming to your phones this summer.

2051
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:17,760
All right.

2052
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,520
Before we get into the Fugu question of the week, guess what, Raginator never responded,

2053
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,160
meaning he's not there.

2054
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:28,160
And I seem to recall he said his PC is kind of challenged anyway, so I am regretfully

2055
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,240
going to have to pass the code to somebody else.

2056
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,680
So once again, I need a number between one and 30.

2057
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,960
Uh, hold on.

2058
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:36,960
What are you looking?

2059
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:37,960
No, don't.

2060
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,960
Just say something.

2061
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:39,960
Don't Google it.

2062
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,960
17.

2063
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:41,960
17.

2064
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:42,960
All right.

2065
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,960
So if Raginator was 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

2066
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:46,960
All right.

2067
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,680
I know that person's in chat and I know he'll respond.

2068
01:50:49,680 --> 01:51:01,240
That is VX Jason XV is number 17 to check in tonight.

2069
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:08,360
Hold on by me, by me a little time here, guys, while I send Jason a private message.

2070
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:09,360
Does he PC game?

2071
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,560
Cause he might be like, Hey, PC games.

2072
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,560
I think he does.

2073
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,080
Yeah, he does.

2074
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:16,080
So all right.

2075
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:20,280
Now I will give Jason like five minutes to respond and if he doesn't respond either,

2076
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:22,200
then we'll move on to somebody else.

2077
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,200
All right.

2078
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,200
All right.

2079
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:29,000
Uh, we're going to get into the Fugu question of the week here.

2080
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,800
Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and our Google plus, put them together

2081
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,280
and you get Fugu.

2082
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:38,320
I don't have the music queued up this week.

2083
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,320
Sorry.

2084
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:43,880
But, um, we read some, some of the responses here on the air.

2085
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:46,800
I don't think we'll get through all of them.

2086
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,920
There was a lot of responses tonight and there's no way I'm going to be able to read all of

2087
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:51,920
these.

2088
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,760
Please, please check out our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange launch radio

2089
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,340
and our Google plus.

2090
01:51:57,340 --> 01:52:00,160
There's a few responses over there too, believe it or not.

2091
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,560
Uh, I, I don't have a URL for it.

2092
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,960
One one zero nine four.

2093
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,960
No, I'm just kidding.

2094
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:05,960
I'm not going to read the whole thing.

2095
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,360
Just go to Google plus and search for orange launch radio.

2096
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,720
You'll find us there.

2097
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:11,080
Here's the question of the week.

2098
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:15,880
Kind of a tricky question because obviously there was a lot of really tough stuff that

2099
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:17,200
happened over the weekend.

2100
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:21,200
You know, just a lot of really unfortunate events.

2101
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:27,280
And when tragedy like this happens, unfortunately people like to point the finger at video games.

2102
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:32,280
And so I wanted to ask this question to our Facebook and Google communities and that is

2103
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:37,280
sometimes when tragedy happens, commentators on big news channels are quick to blame video

2104
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:40,240
games for a person being so deranged.

2105
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:45,280
What if anything can we do as a gaming community to stop this reputation and show that there

2106
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:50,040
are far more good people playing video games than bad?

2107
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:55,400
You know, because when that incident happened in Aurora, you know, over the weekend, which

2108
01:52:55,400 --> 01:53:01,120
was terrible, they splash that guy all over the news as the news tends to do, which is

2109
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:05,240
really unfortunate because they're just making him famous by doing that, which I hate.

2110
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:09,500
But you know, it should be the victims we should be remembering, but anyhow, they always

2111
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:13,960
bring these commentators on because everybody wants to know, why do you do it?

2112
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:14,960
Why do you do it?

2113
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:15,960
What was going on in his head?

2114
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,400
He was a quiet kid and he went crazy.

2115
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,400
Why do you do it?

2116
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,400
Why do you do it?

2117
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:25,360
And somebody always inevitably says video games, you know, which is ridiculous.

2118
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,360
Yeah.

2119
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:29,880
The problem with the video game, blame video games is it's as common now to be playing

2120
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,540
video games as the watch TV.

2121
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:33,200
So you can blame TV now too.

2122
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:37,600
Well, I mean, or you could, it was that rock music he was listening to, it was those comics

2123
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,600
he was reading.

2124
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:41,500
It was, you know, the TV he was watching is the movies he's watching.

2125
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:48,200
It was the drugs and some people blame Batman because he said when he got arrested or whatever

2126
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,880
that he was the joker.

2127
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:52,200
You know, it was the goddamn Batman.

2128
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:56,240
You know who, you know, who is to blame him.

2129
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,120
That's it.

2130
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:02,720
There was a fake article that circulated on Tumblr the night that it happened saying that

2131
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:07,740
he was arrested in like joker cosplay for, and which of course is full of shit.

2132
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,740
Not true.

2133
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:14,560
But it's like, why are people photoshopping fake newspapers to troll like literally an

2134
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,320
hour after it happened saying that he was dressed as the joker?

2135
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:21,960
Well, something about, I mean, again, I don't like talking about him, but I will entertain

2136
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:26,160
that something about he, there was a picture of him with crazy hair that was on the internet.

2137
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:30,720
Again, anything could be photoshopped, I guess, but well, it was on his, uh, adult friend

2138
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:31,720
finder.

2139
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,280
Oh, it's those sexual deviants.

2140
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,280
All right.

2141
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,880
Look, no, it was him.

2142
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,200
It was his fault.

2143
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:38,200
He did it.

2144
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:40,200
I mean, whatever.

2145
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:41,720
Anyway, two words.

2146
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,720
Fuck him.

2147
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,720
All right.

2148
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:44,720
Let's get to though.

2149
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,640
How do we keep the bad reputation off of gamers?

2150
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:50,960
Because there's far more good people playing video games than there are bad.

2151
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,080
Let me go to some of the answers on Facebook.

2152
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:54,360
Read the haze starts us off.

2153
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:59,480
The first thing we should do is not get online and attack the people who blame video games

2154
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,440
because it just proves them right.

2155
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:02,880
Think before you act.

2156
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,480
We need to bring ourselves out there and show our positive side and drown out the negative

2157
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:08,480
noise.

2158
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:12,960
Make a YouTube video or write up on how we are productive members of society.

2159
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,880
Just don't be an asshole on the internet.

2160
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,760
It's as simple as that.

2161
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,920
Or don't watch those news programs because they're sensationalists to get people to watch

2162
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:21,920
them.

2163
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:27,080
Ronnie B says, usually it's the news media, so I'd ask them how is their constant coverage

2164
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:32,680
endorsement of graphic stories 24-7 any less likely to drive someone mad than a video game?

2165
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:36,960
Even if the results of a tragic event is inspired by a video game, what can you do when the

2166
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,600
person is a grown adult?

2167
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:42,880
There is already the ESRB in the US, so I don't think you can really blame video games

2168
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,560
anymore, and I think that's the best argument.

2169
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:46,560
You know, that's true.

2170
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:50,840
A lot of people are driven to this sort of insanity because they think it's going to

2171
01:55:50,840 --> 01:55:53,960
make them famous, and I guess in some ways it does.

2172
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:57,440
And I'm always reminded of this.

2173
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:02,360
In Sacramento, we had a really unfortunate case where a guy shot people at a Jack in

2174
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:03,360
the Box.

2175
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:07,800
I mean, just, you know, another just crazy asshole goes into a store and shoots people.

2176
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:12,120
And part of the reason he did it was he said, I want to be famous.

2177
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,420
I know I'm going to be plastered all over the news.

2178
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:15,420
I'm going to be famous.

2179
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:16,420
I'm going to be the most famous.

2180
01:56:16,420 --> 01:56:18,360
And like, he said that.

2181
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:26,040
Well, in this interesting, ironic twist, that all happened on September 10th, 2001.

2182
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:30,200
So he wasn't famous for very long because the media hopped right onto something else.

2183
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,240
Well, he got his 15 minutes.

2184
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,400
I mean, and it's just like, I'm not trying to be funny.

2185
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:40,920
It's just this really hugely ironic thing, and it just kind of points out, I mean, God,

2186
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:44,200
I hate using that word in conjunction with such tragedy, but you guys know, you know

2187
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:45,520
what I'm getting at.

2188
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:52,200
It's that he, you know, was driven by fame.

2189
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,200
Attention whores.

2190
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,200
That's what they are.

2191
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,200
Yes, right here.

2192
01:56:55,200 --> 01:57:01,360
Um, let's see, uh, Clover N. Responds saying, promote all the charities connected to video

2193
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:02,360
gaming.

2194
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:05,200
I said, vampire says nothing.

2195
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:10,580
It's a waste of time trying to educate our tar to scapegoat.

2196
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:11,580
They do it on purpose.

2197
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:14,080
They do it on purpose because it's a sensational thing.

2198
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:15,240
It gets viewers.

2199
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:17,040
That's all in the end of the day.

2200
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,640
That's all the news programs want is they want more viewers.

2201
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:23,380
So whether that means recording or, you know, covering the news story first or covering

2202
01:57:23,380 --> 01:57:27,080
the most in centralized way, that's really what it is.

2203
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:32,000
They want viewership, so they get paid, add money, the end.

2204
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,280
Why not 18 is nine responds and says, parents, it's not the only solution, but a start on

2205
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,160
knowing what your kids are playing.

2206
01:57:39,160 --> 01:57:43,360
If there's a problem with the kid's brain, then a video game might be the start of stifling

2207
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,360
the problem.

2208
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:45,360
I could be wrong though.

2209
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,920
Great show guys.

2210
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:54,880
Um, Pika Uno says, as someone who works in the media, I can say it's not our, the gamers

2211
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,280
parentheses fault.

2212
01:57:56,280 --> 01:58:00,680
The news is now an entertainment show and entertainment shows need a running narrative.

2213
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:05,220
It's so much easier to just give the public what they want, an obvious scapegoat rather

2214
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:08,680
than to think about how the news itself is propagating this.

2215
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:13,320
If you're really interested in how TV really works from an insider's point of view, I urge

2216
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:19,020
you to watch Charlie Brooker's screen wipe, news wipe, and games wipe on YouTube.

2217
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:23,480
Very interesting comment from Pika Uno, kind of from the inside.

2218
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:27,280
Last one from Facebook, Cody T says, what we could do to get the media and other people

2219
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:31,520
blaming video games to understand that these people that act out in a violent way are not

2220
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,920
doing so because of video games, movies, et cetera.

2221
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:37,880
It has a lot to do with the thoughts they had from the time they were born.

2222
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:39,560
Some people to me are just bad apples.

2223
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:43,640
It has nothing to do with video games, movies, or any kind of medium like that.

2224
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:48,340
It's just easy for the media to pick an outside cause to what was actually in this person's

2225
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:50,020
mind their whole life.

2226
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:55,200
So in conclusion, there is no good or even great way to get media to stop blaming it

2227
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:57,760
on video games because media is media.

2228
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:04,980
And at the end of the day, true gamers know that it is not true.

2229
01:59:04,980 --> 01:59:05,980
Complicated issue.

2230
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:07,060
Before I go to Google, Alan?

2231
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:12,760
With all the, you know, with Chris Hardwick's franchise Nerdist and all this stuff, the

2232
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,160
progress that gamers have made with like PAX and just crossing into the mainstream and

2233
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:25,880
being more of an accessible thing for, you know, it's not as niche as it once was.

2234
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:30,660
But the reality is that it's still considered for the people like ages 45 and older who

2235
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:34,160
watch the news, who get really, you know, into this stuff.

2236
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:36,320
It's still a part of the counterculture, I guess.

2237
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,380
It's still something that a lot of people can't relate to.

2238
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:42,880
That makes it a magnet like Loki was saying about the sensationalism.

2239
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,800
If he was a huge sports nut who was a jock who got like super late in high school and

2240
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:54,220
he was just a big sports freak and did not even own a console, like they wouldn't pursue

2241
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:56,840
that angle because that's considered normal.

2242
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:01,280
They would pursue it as he was a sexual deviant because he had an adult friend finder profile.

2243
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:07,760
They would say, okay, well, what's the first thing we can find that's even a little bit

2244
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:11,100
like not as bland and as mainstream as possible?

2245
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:14,200
Video games is often that thing because a lot of people over a certain age don't understand

2246
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:15,200
it.

2247
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:16,200
Let me ask this question.

2248
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:21,680
And I'm taking a devil's advocate angle because I think a lot of the sensationalism happens

2249
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:26,360
because we just want to understand as a society, why?

2250
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:28,160
Why did this happen?

2251
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,240
Why did evil?

2252
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:31,640
There's no other word to describe it.

2253
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,760
Why did evil happen?

2254
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,960
Where did we as a society fail to allow this to happen?

2255
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:37,960
Well, they keep it.

2256
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:40,240
Here's the other thing too, is they keep saying he operated on his own, but how do you get

2257
02:00:40,240 --> 02:00:41,240
in the theater?

2258
02:00:41,240 --> 02:00:44,240
How do you get through the bought a ticket?

2259
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,240
You had to suit up though.

2260
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:46,240
Right?

2261
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:47,240
Did you hear what they got up to?

2262
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,840
Worrying how, where's he going to hide an air of 15 regardless.

2263
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:54,440
I mean, I believe I had heard something in red online.

2264
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:59,180
He used an emergency exit to go to his car and prompt it open so that he could get back

2265
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:01,000
in the theater regardless.

2266
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,600
The guy had his house booby trapped to the nines to try and kill some policemen too.

2267
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:09,160
I mean, he was clearly deranged in all sorts of way.

2268
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:10,600
He thought of a way.

2269
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,960
He thought of a way.

2270
02:01:11,960 --> 02:01:13,000
So whatever.

2271
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:17,800
I mean, but again, let me go back to the devil's advocate question.

2272
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:21,760
What's wrong with wanting to know where did we fail as a society?

2273
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:25,100
Well, that's the difficult question.

2274
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:31,640
The easy question is to just say, this terrifies me and I'm confused and hurting and this is

2275
02:01:31,640 --> 02:01:36,360
a horrible story, but the media is saying that it's video games and I'm old and I've

2276
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:39,880
never played those and I don't know anyone who plays those so I can see better at night

2277
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,240
knowing that it's that evil yucky thing that's influencing people to do this.

2278
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:47,920
It's the quickest way to get people to like they need to associate something because they

2279
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,840
just they don't understand it.

2280
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:55,320
And it's unfortunate that video games is often used because it's a billion dollar industry.

2281
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,700
It's everywhere.

2282
02:01:56,700 --> 02:02:00,720
People will pay attention if you obviously lie and say bullshitty things about the industry

2283
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:05,960
that aren't true because people that play games know that it's not like that.

2284
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:11,200
But people are desperate for an easy answer to feel better about the grief that they feel

2285
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:12,200
when they hear stories like this.

2286
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,800
I think that's a very valid answer.

2287
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,200
I think you're right on the money with that.

2288
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,200
I think you're right.

2289
02:02:16,200 --> 02:02:20,500
I think a lot of this tends to you know help people it's all to help people sleep better

2290
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:26,040
at night because hope it doesn't happen to them.

2291
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:29,200
You know because already people are like well was he mentally ill?

2292
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:32,100
Had he tried to get help before and then he was denied help?

2293
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:35,920
You know there are all these existential questions about what drives a person to do this but

2294
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:40,860
people need like they're like oh shit this like I'm terrified this is a horrible story.

2295
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:45,640
If they can just make that mental association of oh he was influenced because of this maybe

2296
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:49,300
and that's scary and weird because I'm old and I know I don't know what that is.

2297
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:51,520
They can they can get that.

2298
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,000
They can pin their terror to something.

2299
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And because I think there is a youth angle to video games that's a good go to for the

2300
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,640
media if I'm making sense.

2301
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:05,640
Absolutely.

2302
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:06,640
No you are.

2303
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,640
Absolutely.

2304
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:08,640
Absolutely.

2305
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:10,400
Osfer in chat says me and my mom went and saw the midnight showing of The Dark Knight

2306
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:11,400
Rises.

2307
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:15,440
A lot of people told us that they were glad that we were okay but I just shrugged it off.

2308
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:18,640
I'm not going to let one guy ruin my movie going experience.

2309
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:22,480
It's also funny how now when I tell people they should see the movie they tell me that

2310
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,480
they don't want to get shot.

2311
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:25,480
Absolutely ridiculous.

2312
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:26,480
Which I agree with.

2313
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:33,940
It had I mean unfortunately I mean what short term memory those people have because it's

2314
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:35,840
really unfortunate.

2315
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:40,600
Evil people killed people while they were working on 9-11.

2316
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:45,620
Evil people have shot people on college campuses and on high school campuses.

2317
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:48,000
Evil people have gone into fast food restaurants and shot people.

2318
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,800
I mean it doesn't it doesn't matter where you are.

2319
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,720
I mean that's just the sad reality of the situation.

2320
02:03:54,720 --> 02:03:58,480
To blame the movie and say I'm not going to go see a midnight movie because I might get

2321
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:06,240
shot is incredibly ignorant and disrespectful of all the history that came before.

2322
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:07,240
I think.

2323
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:08,240
Right?

2324
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,240
Am I right?

2325
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:10,240
Maybe?

2326
02:04:10,240 --> 02:04:14,040
You're more likely to get a heart attack from that bucket of popcorn than you are to get

2327
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:15,960
shot at the movie theater.

2328
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:21,560
It doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right that that happened or we should forgive it

2329
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:23,720
or shrug it off as well.

2330
02:04:23,720 --> 02:04:24,720
People getting shot.

2331
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,000
That's just something that happens.

2332
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,880
I'm not saying that.

2333
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:33,080
We need we still strive as a society to figure out where where were the warning signs so

2334
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:36,240
we can catch it before this happens again.

2335
02:04:36,240 --> 02:04:38,560
How do we stop it from happening again.

2336
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:46,000
Anyhow going to Google Plus quickly Wendy S. on Google Plus says we should point out

2337
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,080
that millions of people play these games and with the number of people playing games pointing

2338
02:04:50,080 --> 02:04:55,320
out that the bad guy played games is saying is like saying he watched TV they did in fact

2339
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:00,120
mention the bad guy in this case played role playing fantasy games ridiculous point in

2340
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:04,520
that millions play Skyrim or wow I have to agree with Mike which I'll read in a minute

2341
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:08,960
here that acting like ladies and gentlemen online and not accepting people being jerks

2342
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:13,400
will help as well so let me go to that comment from Act Def that said well for starters stop

2343
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:19,080
acting like dicks on online games or when gaming other people in general second stop

2344
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:22,680
acting like you're a badass know it all just because you play first person shooter games

2345
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:27,120
though this applies to other games to also educate the other people that aren't playing

2346
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:31,240
video games and pretty much state to them that video games do not cause violence and

2347
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:36,560
especially to parents proper education stops this kind of action luckily most people have

2348
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:40,960
stopped blaming video games for this type of situations at least in a general sense

2349
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:47,140
I'm a couple more comments quickly entertainment says we can point out how even the most level

2350
02:05:47,140 --> 02:05:51,800
headed and accepted comments can be wrong for example one of the most widely quoted

2351
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,960
statements from Bowling for Columbine was by Marilyn Manson he said that he wouldn't

2352
02:05:55,960 --> 02:06:01,080
say anything to the people who executed the Columbine attacks he would listen to them

2353
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:05,960
in David Cullen's book Columbine which in a review of the book is called the 9-11 Commission

2354
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:12,040
report for this tragedy a psychologist who treated Dylan Klebold's dismissed Manson comment

2355
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:17,200
as the wrong approach Klebold psychologist said that Dylan was a sociopath a manipulator

2356
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:22,580
a young man absolutely set in his goals allowing him to talk would not have allowed anyone

2357
02:06:22,580 --> 02:06:27,100
to get into this criminals mind he would have charmed them just as he did his parents his

2358
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:36,320
teachers and his psychologists oh my god Marilyn Manson then is on the warpath now he's been

2359
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:41,600
charmed there's a whole nother thing I mean Marilyn Manson has basically made a career

2360
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,300
off of attention-grabbing and it's the same thing many people have done in our culture

2361
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:53,760
they've made millions off of grabbing attention Alice Cooper Madonna Gaga kiss right okay

2362
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:58,760
lastly last comment Preston Evans says blame graduate studies for the shooting he was studying

2363
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:03,880
neuroscience that would do that to anyone psyche in reality there is no current way

2364
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:08,800
to stop ridicule of one small part of our society for one great event when all parties

2365
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:13,800
have a part in it it's too hard to fix that just throw one to the wolves instead of of

2366
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:20,840
all taking the slap on the cheek for your part in the grand planned all right I know

2367
02:07:20,840 --> 02:07:27,680
that's a tough topic guys but you know again on CNN and this happened on CNN within hours

2368
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:34,640
there's that pundit on the TV it's video games this is what we have to put up with as a culture

2369
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:40,400
so some different ideas from our listeners on how to stop it there you go our frugal

2370
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:46,960
question of the week all right let's try to lighten the mood up let's get back into video

2371
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:52,880
games talking about some less serious video games and so forth or in this case I guess

2372
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:59,360
this is something a little serious going on on Xbox right Loki exactly they've been secretly

2373
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:05,460
tightening their security and this started I guess with the spring update that we just

2374
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:11,440
had the one that prepped for you know the fall update that kind of thing right now says

2375
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:18,360
they are encouraging people to check their security information update their passwords

2376
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:24,760
and of course you know the the update they said built on security enhancements for the

2377
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:31,080
near future and so I guess they're working there might be something that they'll announce

2378
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:37,420
for like the fall update or something like that my thing is though it I know I understand

2379
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:41,940
that they're going to be secretly doing this stuff but why go such a secret route with

2380
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:47,320
it unless you know maybe they're worried that they're if they said oh yeah we're updating

2381
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:52,840
our security people ah so your security had issues that need to be addressed then you

2382
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:57,840
just wouldn't admit to it but the same time when they do it secretly it kind of makes

2383
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,240
me wonder they really did have issues that need to be addressed and they just didn't

2384
02:09:02,240 --> 02:09:06,760
want to cop to it so either way at least they're making it step in the right direction I guess

2385
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:11,120
but they really say what security measures are being put in place that weren't in place

2386
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:16,360
before and I can understand the secrecy behind me as critical as I've been of Microsoft on

2387
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:20,040
this whole issue in the past I can understand why they don't want to give it all away because

2388
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:24,160
they don't want to give the people that are hacking the accounts hints so I can understand

2389
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:28,200
why they're being very vague about it and I'm strangely okay with that I'm glad they

2390
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:34,320
have finally come out and said something finally and that they have said that they've taken

2391
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:40,000
the measures to stop it and I I honestly think that hacked on xbox.com and their whole little

2392
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:45,000
report about that they were working customer service I think that is directly to thank

2393
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:49,160
for this finally coming out finally um and then here's some of the details of stuff they

2394
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:54,080
do that we increase notifications to members whose accounts may be compromised to add proofs

2395
02:09:54,080 --> 02:10:00,240
update the passwords and if necessary or necessary uh contact xbox support this helps our team

2396
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:04,440
lock down an account quickly investigate and restore the account to its rightful owner

2397
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:10,600
uh we've taken legal action to pull down uh online posts of gamer tags usernames and passwords

2398
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:15,560
gathered from malware phishing schemes to help protect our members our live um spring

2399
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:19,680
update include me behind the scenes improvements to help us build on security enhancements

2400
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:24,680
for the near future we are sending unique codes to sec um security phone numbers and

2401
02:10:24,680 --> 02:10:30,960
secondary email addresses provided by members to verify authorization for xbox.com purchases

2402
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:36,400
um account change attempts uh not staying from members trusted device I can vouch for

2403
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:42,600
that for a fact because we've had to recently um because you know how much of a pain in

2404
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:47,560
the ass it is is to um stop their auto renew well we had some other co-workers I've created

2405
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:53,080
accounts for my old pc but since you know um you know I've worked at the company that

2406
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:58,280
I worked at uh my switch species and so they was asking me for a second verifiable thing

2407
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:01,440
problem is though is you can put any phone number you want in there and they'll just

2408
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:05,160
call you with the security thing so that doesn't really help you but I mean granted it will

2409
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:11,480
give you a phone number that they can send that to cool or text it to that's the other

2410
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:15,360
thing too so if like you know there's a lot of free texting programs out there that you

2411
02:11:15,360 --> 02:11:21,840
can get a disposable number for that so it's not it's an extra layer but it's not foolproof

2412
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,960
have they finally programmed it in on the xbox where it asks you for your card security

2413
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:30,040
code whenever you make a transaction because I know that's available on xbox.com no why

2414
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:35,320
don't they do that that would have helped so in so many situations because the hackers

2415
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:39,120
would not have all those card codes and only let a person do it like three times and then

2416
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:47,380
it removes the card from file it would seem super easy that's the way to do it am I crazy

2417
02:11:47,380 --> 02:11:52,840
well they wouldn't be as convenient to purchase stuff and that's well too fucking bad because

2418
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:57,680
it's the right thing to do well the right thing is not profitable and then of course

2419
02:11:57,680 --> 02:12:02,920
you know we're working on we're working to reduce market incentives for criminal activity

2420
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:07,520
engaging in identity theft trading and stolen accounts and committing credit card fraud

2421
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:13,880
are legal and violate our terms of use those involved in these activities blah blah blah

2422
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:19,960
so they get banned and blah but here's the thing though is reduce market incentives last

2423
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:25,440
I remember I believe Madden now started selling those cards too that FIFA was so popular for

2424
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:31,440
you know those the ones that you can exchange for real money or something basically you

2425
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:39,360
buy all these fun cards and sell the account so no you're not discouraging it in fact those

2426
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:45,160
companies are encouraging it by adding more games to that process so I don't think that's

2427
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:57,800
really going away but just change your passwords on a regular base all right moving on to another

2428
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:01,960
new story here and this has to do with the Wii U we haven't talked a lot about tonight

2429
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:06,000
but there's still some rumblings going on there's always new rumors every week and this

2430
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,800
time it's about Borderlands 2 but Gearbox actually the co-founder Brian Martell came

2431
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:17,640
out and said good things about the Wii U quote we really like the Wii U I think it's a really

2432
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:21,180
cool platform I like what they're doing obviously with the touchscreen and it will be interesting

2433
02:13:21,180 --> 02:13:25,880
to see what Microsoft does with their approach to that idea it's one of those problems of

2434
02:13:25,880 --> 02:13:31,200
the Wii the only people who have ever made a lot of money on the Wii is Nintendo if Borderlands

2435
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:37,160
2 was on the Wii U the thing I would most be excited about is inventory management it

2436
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:41,440
would be amazing on that it would just be fantastic and I think the artwork would look

2437
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:44,960
really good with the way they can deal with the resolution and textures I think it's a

2438
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:49,560
really good console so a lot of people are jumping ahead and saying confirmed Borderlands

2439
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:54,680
2 on Wii U well of course they want to port it to any system they can if it's easy to

2440
02:13:54,680 --> 02:14:00,200
port it over then cool but once again it's kind of running into that same issue with

2441
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:04,760
what did DS do all the time oh well put the pause screen stuff the inventory stuff on

2442
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:09,840
the bottom screen instead of you know having to be a separate screen so do I really want

2443
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:13,520
to buy another system so that I don't have to pause my game to change my inventory I

2444
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,040
don't fucking care I'll pause my game to change my inventory and not have to buy another system

2445
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:25,920
for $300 but that's assuming you know you're a person who doesn't end up buying it for

2446
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:30,720
some other reason I understand that but at the same time though you know all those inventory

2447
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:33,920
things at the bottom screen you still have to look away from the screen to do all that

2448
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:40,760
shit so I don't know oh well also in related news about the Wii U another Wii U game this

2449
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:46,160
one's called Rise of the Guardians has been given a November release date November 23rd

2453
02:15:09,320 --> 02:15:14,540

02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:20,000
to November 18th as the day I can't wait for it to not be that day I'm gonna play that

2457
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:41,240
because of three different skews we already covered this on another show go back in the

2458
02:15:41,240 --> 02:15:48,040
archives and find it all right Alan what do you got for us in the silly and weird lawsuit

2459
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:53,860
department there's the story that's come out company based out of out of Texas excuse me

2460
02:15:53,860 --> 02:16:00,320
I tech patent collector Unilock is the name of the company has filed suit against Mojang

2461
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:06,220
Mojang as some people may realize or remember is a Marcus persons company he's the developer

2462
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:15,840
and creator of Minecraft so this company Unilock is suing Mojang for and this is a typo in

2463
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:23,260
the thing that was put out to Mojang like the notice they're being sued Minecraft with

2464
02:16:23,260 --> 02:16:29,260
a D so there's a typo in the claim that gets the name of the product wrong specifically

2465
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:37,480
for the Android version of Minecraft the patent that it's been that they are accusing Mojang

2466
02:16:37,480 --> 02:16:43,720
of infringing is a system and method for preventing unauthorized access to electronic data isn't

2467
02:16:43,720 --> 02:16:49,080
that a password like I know I'm kind of ignorant about this this patent I haven't read the

2468
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:55,320
whole thing because it's very dry but specifically the filing references claim 107 of the patent

2469
02:16:55,320 --> 02:17:00,400
which covers a computer code executable on an electronic device to prevent unauthorized

2470
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:06,840
access to electronic data stored on the electronic device so I don't know if it's the certain

2471
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:11,760
system or style that Minecraft is doing this on the Android but they're saying oh yeah

2472
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:16,840
we did that and only we can do that so they're suing it and Notch has said unfortunately

2473
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:21,600
for them they are suing us over a software patent if needed I will throw piles of money

2474
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:27,040
making sure they don't get a cent software patents are plain evil innovation within software

2475
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:32,840
is basically free and it's growing incredibly rapid patents only slow it down Unilock is

2476
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:37,400
seeking damages compounded by both pre and post judgment interest as well as ongoing

2477
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:46,140
royalties from a Mojang so like what the fuck yeah and it's not not Minecraft the PC platform

2478
02:17:46,140 --> 02:18:00,380
but specifically the Android one for whatever reason and not just saying lol at you alright

2479
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:04,360
this does sound a little patent trollish to me right yeah it's just me because they got

2480
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:10,320
the name of the yeah I got the name of the product wrong in the in the suit wow yeah

2481
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:18,160
good luck with that guys moving on Loki people are really trying to give me the word that

2482
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:23,560
tingle suit it's not gonna happen not gonna happen remember you lost your opportunity

2483
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:29,280
should bought more copies of what was that again I don't remember the name and title

2484
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:38,920
oh yeah I have judgment brown eye of judgment so let's talk a little bit about oh yeah because

2485
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:46,680
you know it's been what a week so of course you know they were they've been doing updates

2486
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:51,760
on the Kickstarter one of the updates that they did to kind of get people to trust them

2487
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:56,600
a little more so that they let them know that one of the people on the production team is

2488
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:09,880
actually the guy that helped launch the Amazon Kindle line movie Dolly I believe godly how

2489
02:19:09,880 --> 02:19:15,880
you pronounce his last name anyways he was in charge of the Kindle line you know he's

2490
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:22,580
says you know he's basically his purpose there is to make sure that the system launches and

2491
02:19:22,580 --> 02:19:28,900
you know saying that you know my job is ensure that we meet the needs of gamers and developers

2492
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:35,000
and you know saying that they're trying to get out the software development kit as quickly

2493
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:40,860
as possible to perspective developers also that they're hiring engineers to join their

2494
02:19:40,860 --> 02:19:47,640
team as well some other announcements that they made regarding the oh yeah is that they're

2495
02:19:47,640 --> 02:19:53,280
going to have an exclusive game to it Robert Bulling's human element is going to have a

2496
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:58,320
prequel on the system human element is going to be a zombie game that's going to be coming

2497
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:07,960
out on consoles in 2015 that's a long time and he's going to have a prequel to be launching

2498
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:12,960
on oh yeah first actually at the launch of the console and it's going to kind of follow

2499
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:20,720
the the events that lead up to the actual human element game of course also you may

2500
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:27,920
remember Robert Bulling from well his new studio Robo Robo Toki and he originally you

2501
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:36,600
know was one developers for Call of Duty modern warfare so prequel and of course he also donated

2502
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:42,040
ten thousand dollars to the project as well so they've got lots of you know their people

2503
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:46,240
sign on there's actually a lot of indie developers that are kind of jumping on board as well

2504
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:51,560
a lot of them actually have kick-started projects as well so at least there's gonna be some

2505
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:56,720
games on there and they've been trying to answer questions and whatnot from the community

2506
02:20:56,720 --> 02:21:03,440
regarding why we've seen a controller and that kind of stuff so interest well now that

2507
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:08,440
they have a game finally to talk about what do you think I think it sounds like a cool

2508
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:12,520
game I don't know what kind of a game it is though but there's a lot of other like you

2509
02:21:12,520 --> 02:21:17,320
know people there in the Kickstarter you know world they're like that want to bring their

2510
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:26,080
games to the console like one they're gonna be talking about pretty soon watch the very

2511
02:21:26,080 --> 02:21:31,320
soon is another shadow run game that they're thinking about bringing that to oh yeah as

2512
02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:36,080
well there's a lot of games are right now saying hey you know if we get this game out

2513
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:42,920
we're gonna put it on you as well so they've got support it just I mean I think it's just

2514
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:47,720
really early still in the development stage as far as you know the design I mean obviously

2515
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:55,080
they haven't finalized a you know a controller yet but they're gonna have one it's just you

2516
02:21:55,080 --> 02:22:02,480
know they have a beta kit running or you know a prototype and that's it all right I'm gonna

2517
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:08,200
move on with another story here but first we finally gave that code away instead of

2518
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:12,960
doing it to just somebody random and unfortunately twice we hit people that weren't around I

2519
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:16,600
finally put a call out in chat and I said look if you're gonna use this code and you

2520
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:22,400
want the code send me a private message right now and I asked Alan to pick a random number

2521
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:29,240
and the winner was Ospher won the code and yes he's going to use it so congrats thanks

2522
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:33,760
again sorry that contest was a little bit of a mess but I thought I thought we do something

2523
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:38,800
fun with the new website registration but oops I guess people were were checking in

2524
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:43,920
and then leaving to get dinner so there you go at least we know it's gonna get some good

2525
02:22:43,920 --> 02:22:50,280
use because it was an opt-in thing that time all right let's move on to this I think this

2526
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:54,920
is a little bit of a follow-up from last week because I remember we brought the first part

2527
02:22:54,920 --> 02:23:00,320
of this up because remember it was about that game on the iPhone that was heavily borrowing

2528
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:07,640
quote-quote assets from torchlight and torchlight was pissed so they you know I guess they went

2529
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:11,680
and they went on a Twitter rampage and all this stuff but here's the interesting thing

2530
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:20,420
the company egls actually came out and made a statement I guess oh gosh where is this

2531
02:23:20,420 --> 02:23:27,600
here egls went to touch arcades and said we hardly agree with Travis Baldry from ruining

2532
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:35,320
games who judged the egls wholesale stole most of the assets from torchlight egls is

2533
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:40,080
entertainment game labs by the way who is the developer behind this only based on the

2534
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:47,800
similarity between several small monsters the judgment is simply untenable yeah except

2535
02:23:47,800 --> 02:23:53,720
there's a little more to that egls employees say they are quote both crazy game fans and

2536
02:23:53,720 --> 02:24:00,600
a static movie lovers so the comparisons are an accident at best arm heroes said the last

2537
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:05,880
time they checked was still available on itunes it's free to play with purchases well what

2538
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:11,100
ended up happening a little later egls did come out and say all right we'll remove some

2539
02:24:11,100 --> 02:24:15,900
parts of the game so they talk about that they are going to make some small changes

2540
02:24:15,900 --> 02:24:23,280
to the game they want he but runic games really wants egls to admit that they just told me

2541
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:27,320
well they did they actually stole even the audio from the game and really some unused

2542
02:24:27,320 --> 02:24:33,440
audio clips like a certain sort or something like that that they have in torchlight all

2543
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:37,960
the audio files were named exactly the same as torchlight all of them like even you know

2544
02:24:37,960 --> 02:24:41,840
stuff that they didn't use he said I also downloaded the app you can unzip them and

2545
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:45,880
look at any iphone app and there was a sound manifest that listed all the sound files that

2546
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:50,160
was in the game and they were verbatim all of our sound files including our own misspellings

2547
02:24:50,160 --> 02:25:01,040
uh oh yeah so they stole them yikes now armed heroes online is now down I guess runic filed

2548
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:05,840
a complaint and finally it got taken down but it took a little while that was on when

2549
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:13,120
did it finally get pulled july 19th that was thursday when it finally got pulled and we

2550
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:20,080
reported on that last week I wonder how many people uh grabbed that game black wolf in

2551
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:23,720
our chat room says they're in china so there was nothing legal they could do yeah they

2552
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:28,120
can't like they can't sue the company but they can fight them through apple that's what

2553
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:34,600
they did apparently they can also reinforce stereotypes regarding china what that it's

2554
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:41,680
thieves and gold farmers and all this remember mose and all this or what they copy they copy

2555
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:48,320
and you know counterfeit stuff well and it's any it seems like any story I read nowadays

2556
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:52,720
about a chinese company making a game it's oh okay would you counterfeit oh there it

2557
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:59,600
is hey look we stole stuff from team fortress 2 this time oh hey shana linko in our chat

2558
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:04,200
room says they also stole the warlock tier 10 gear for one of their classes from warcraft

2559
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:11,440
world of warcraft so it appears they like to borrow from lots of different places hmm

2560
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:16,160
but it's gone now and let's I wonder if apple actually like really hammered the ban hammer

2561
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:20,080
on them because you know apple usually when shit like this happens apple will just say

2562
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:24,920
you've lost your license done you're not getting to put publish anymore but most of them just

2563
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:28,520
come back under another name you're not gonna publish anymore until you pay another hundred

2564
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:33,360
dollars to buy a different license under a different name exactly all right every week

2565
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:38,840
we invite your emails at mailbag orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer she usually dives

2566
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:43,680
into the mailbag head first to read some of her favorite emails but in her absence she's

2567
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:48,320
loaned the hazmat suit to alan who will dive into the email bag i need to state this we

2568
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:54,200
received a lot of emails this week actually yeah there's a bunch um nine it's it's weird

2569
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:58,320
because usually we're sitting here with one or two going send us more well you sent more

2570
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:02,080
this week but here's what we're gonna do because we don't have enough time to read especially

2571
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:05,240
after some of the other segments now we don't have enough time to read all the emails i'm

2572
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:10,040
gonna have alan read the first half of the emails that came in we're gonna roll the second

2573
02:27:10,040 --> 02:27:15,780
half to next week okay uh it doesn't mean you can't email us still just send more emails

2574
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:20,080
mailbag orange lounge radio.com but i mean like i even tried to go in and screen the

2575
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:24,540
emails and like they're all valid they're all pretty good so we want to get to them

2576
02:27:24,540 --> 02:27:32,200
all just not all tonight first email is from robert m subject three questions this is robert

2577
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:37,480
m and i just had three somewhat quick questions or rather two and an observation first have

2578
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:42,440
you guys had the chance to check out spelunky yet i saw on a preview of the 360 version

2579
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:47,360
that someone did a mac port so it's one of my steam shortcuts now reportedly steam may

2580
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:52,140
be getting a version of the game with the 360s graphics and extra modes secondly if

2581
02:27:52,140 --> 02:27:58,600
you're too i haven't checked it out sorry blame the rest of the steam sale on that one

2582
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:04,440
yeah secondly if you're too busy with minecraft based on what you know do you see updates

2583
02:28:04,440 --> 02:28:10,440
for the ios version falling by the wayside uh with the android version because i don't

2584
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:15,080
really follow the minecraft forums enough to i haven't played the ios version at all

2585
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:19,360
it's kind of like for ios game it's kind of expensive which is ridiculous because i have

2586
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:23,080
like 19 credit on my itunes account right now thanks to gift cards but i don't know

2587
02:28:23,080 --> 02:28:27,860
i just i've kind of avoided it for some inexplicable reason but you have it don't you matt have

2588
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:36,840
what minecraft on ios uh i have it on android oh you have it on android i would think that

2589
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:42,760
i mean minecraft on pc is so popular because it's pretty it's like limitless right the

2590
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:47,200
world just goes on forever right i don't think you can do that on the phone and i think the

2591
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:50,960
the 360 has really taken off so maybe the phone's really limited what they've gotten

2592
02:28:50,960 --> 02:28:55,320
there's a lot of like there's object types that aren't there and there's a lot of things

2593
02:28:55,320 --> 02:29:01,720
that you have unlimited supplies of because they saw voice yeah technically the 360 version

2594
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:04,780
is limited too but there was a story that came out this week they've sold 3 million

2595
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:10,040
copies of that it's one of the biggest xbox live arcade titles ever crazy finally going

2596
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:14,360
back to the email finally not a question i came across a banner ad for one of those free

2597
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:20,360
to play empire building games with the mandatory woman in the image being anna williams as

2598
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:25,740
in literally the tekken 6 character art weird i'm almost certain amco has nothing to do

2599
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:32,760
with this ftp keep up it's probably from china i'm just saying i'm just gonna refer you

2600
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:37,660
to that story we just read i'm just gonna say just just rewind the podcast 10 minutes

2601
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:41,360
and go back to that last story and that's probably what's going on unless it's an amco

2602
02:29:41,360 --> 02:29:45,740
game but i kind of doubt that anna williams by the way was an amazing tekken character

2603
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:51,580
just saying okay this one i'm not going to read because i think that's an admin question

2604
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:59,260
for you oh yeah yeah don't read that one sorry that is one we can screen out okay um next

2605
02:29:59,260 --> 02:30:04,740
email from jeffrey help is there a support group to help me stop buying all of the games

2606
02:30:04,740 --> 02:30:09,940
in the summer steam sale maybe a transdermal patch to slowly meter out old video games

2607
02:30:09,940 --> 02:30:16,300
that i will probably never play well you came to the wrong place i've picked up a couple

2608
02:30:16,300 --> 02:30:21,700
indie bundles the thq pack and a few other odds and ends i most likely won't touch half

2609
02:30:21,700 --> 02:30:27,620
of the games included i'm just interjecting my own note here for all of the games that

2610
02:30:27,620 --> 02:30:31,680
i bought this weekend or on this week under the sale i don't have the hard drive space

2611
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:36,380
to install like half of them at once so yeah it's very easy to have hundreds of gigs of

2612
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:42,100
games in your library um i most likely won't touch half the games included now i see what

2613
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:47,980
happens to old people when they watch qvc that shit is no joke my mother is addicted

2614
02:30:47,980 --> 02:30:51,820
to qvc and she'll never admit it and she'll hate me for telling you very prescient and

2615
02:30:51,820 --> 02:30:58,940
terrifying observation and it is 100 correct oh my god steam is qvc without the host but

2616
02:30:58,940 --> 02:31:03,740
at least qvc has like marie osmond and shit true story you guys i think i've mentioned

2625
02:31:57,820 --> 02:32:02,780
30 minutes of the show here's here's what i would like to see happen um a little bit

2626
02:32:02,780 --> 02:32:09,440
more to help offset the whole buyer's remorse saying i would like to see more of like an

2627

2642
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:32,900

2643
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:37,140
only hope to be that energetic it's only gonna come out like sometime later and he's been

2644
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:42,220
on some sort of drug or something like that like he's just the only drug that man is on

2645
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:51,060
his penis okay he's on wow i'm just saying he's got a healthy dose of fabulous and there's

2646
02:33:51,060 --> 02:34:00,060
absolutely nothing wrong with that clearly hey right alan i'm just saying just saying

2647
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:06,300
out there i mean like if that if that's what's making him so spunky at like age 60 i'm sorry

2648
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:11,180
we need more i i'm be i'm being completely real i don't care travis you play this clip

2649
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:15,520
over and over on your show if you want i don't care make fun of me we need more people like

2650
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:19,180
richard simmons in the world really i mean there is there's nothing wrong with richard

2651
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:23,220
simmons richard simmons is the antithesis of the evil we were talking about earlier

2652
02:34:23,220 --> 02:34:31,340
right what's what is wrong with richard simmons nothing i hope nothing like what you were

2653
02:34:31,340 --> 02:34:34,460
talking about ever does come out because that would greatly disappoint me but i think he's

2654
02:34:34,460 --> 02:34:39,380
just a good person he's just trying to get old people not to die what's wrong with that

2655
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:48,800
we don't want grandma to die hi olr sorry tonic vision i got a chance yesterday to go

2656
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:53,840
check out the wii u in person they are doing a tensity tour and inviting club nintendo

2657
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:58,380
members and wanted to share my impressions with you to preface i would just like to say

2658
02:34:58,380 --> 02:35:02,780
that i don't consider myself to really be a fanboy of any particular system and don't

2659
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:07,160
really have a vested interest in one over another because to me they all have various

2660
02:35:07,160 --> 02:35:12,140
strengths and weaknesses i own basically every current system including the 3ds and the vita

2661
02:35:12,140 --> 02:35:17,880
and i'm generally excited enough by next generation hardware to be a consistent early adopter

2662
02:35:17,880 --> 02:35:22,300
with that said i really cannot find any way to get excited about the wii u even after

2663
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:27,860
hands-on play with each and every launch title why is this for me it is because of the following

2664
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:32,780
three reasons so this guy got an exclusive invite to some like top secret come play the

2665
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:36,580
wii u in an unmarked building type of thing speaking of which i may actually have an impression

2666
02:35:36,580 --> 02:35:44,060
of the wii u after this week oh our ubisoft guy may be bringing a wii u to our game conference

2667
02:35:44,060 --> 02:35:48,860
saying i think it's probably for just dance four but um is there a rabbids game on wii

2668
02:35:48,860 --> 02:35:54,860
u i'm sure there is may or may not he's trying to get a wii u dev kit out but we'll see hmm

2669
02:35:54,860 --> 02:36:00,500
all right sorry item one the name sucks plain and simple why is this a big deal it's a big

2670
02:36:00,500 --> 02:36:04,980
deal because it's indicative of the fact that nintendo has become a little too comfortable

2671
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:09,260
this is still a we folks yes it has a new controller and yes the graphics are prettier

2672
02:36:09,260 --> 02:36:13,620
but it is still a we at the end of the day what is my motivation for investing in a new

2673
02:36:13,620 --> 02:36:18,340
console when it's still in large part the old console this may make sense when you are

2674
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:22,220
buying a new smartphone and want those cool new features but you're going to be getting

2675
02:36:22,220 --> 02:36:26,580
a new one in a year anyway this console is going to be in your living room for at least

2676
02:36:26,580 --> 02:36:35,540
five years so why is essentially uh so why is essentially we the sequel two well you

2677
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:43,300
bought on super nintendo you take a playstation 3 and that's okay sequel sequels to consoles

2678
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:47,860
are fine there's nothing more buttons okay that was oh well fuck me i guess my whole

2679
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:54,200
point's invalid thank you loki i've seen the light well i i think he's saying that aside

2680
02:36:54,200 --> 02:36:59,620
from the the graphics hardware i mean the nintendo to the super nintendo was a huge

2681
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:07,820
step in audio visual mode 7 about your shit up all right all right rob rob yes if there's

2682
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:15,180
games on the like okay the jump from the no nes sns so you have zelda and mario brothers

2683
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:19,660
and then you had super mario world and you know zelda 3 links to the past which are two

2684
02:37:19,660 --> 02:37:24,460
like of the best games ever exactly exactly yeah those were amazing fucking games and

2685
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:29,700
look at how much better they are than the pre you know the previous system are we seeing

2686
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:33,300
that with the wii u that's the thing it's like we have a new mario game that's exactly

2687
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:36,900
like the fucking mario game that's already on the wii that's my thing if they came out

2688
02:37:36,900 --> 02:37:41,340
with a game that's like holy fucking shit that's goddamn amazing it's so much better

2689
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:44,860
than the previous mario game where oh my god look at the zelda game it's fucking amazing

2690
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:49,540
it's so much better than the one louis then maybe it'd be a different story but it's not

2691
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:56,660
they are the same fucking games slightly prettier but basically the same it is hard to argue

2692
02:37:56,660 --> 02:38:01,120
with that the only thing i could say is that the zelda game wasn't a launch title but granted

2693
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:09,700
the mario game was um maybe the best is yet to come i hope we'll see item two mario mario

2694
02:38:09,700 --> 02:38:15,540
mario enough we get it mario sells like crazy everyone loves mario we get it we expect a

2695
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:19,900
new mario title with the launch of a new nintendo system absolutely what we don't expect or

2696
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:24,780
deserve is a lazy reskin of a game that came out three years ago this is not enough to

2697
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:28,700
sell your system nintendo at least not to me it's like eating pizza for dinner does

2698
02:38:28,700 --> 02:38:33,100
it taste good absolutely do i want to eat it every day for the next 10 years hell no

2699
02:38:33,100 --> 02:38:37,940
so don't ask me to i would i was just telling alan last night we haven't ordered pizza in

2700
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:41,500
a long time and he's like oh you want to go to papa murphy's get a take and bake i'm like

2701
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:48,140
no i want no i can sausage that's right we are going like we're gonna call straw hat

2702
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:52,500
and we're gonna get it delivered in a box can you put a christmas ham just right on

2703
02:38:52,500 --> 02:38:57,160
the pizza when i worked at it when i worked at a pizza place i never got sick of pizza

2704
02:38:57,160 --> 02:39:03,220
i could eat pizza every goddamn day and and i would be happy eating pizza every day i

2705
02:39:03,220 --> 02:39:08,540
understand the point item three the technology isn't new i have played games on a touch screen

2706
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:12,340
and i've played games with motion control putting them together is not innovative and

2707
02:39:12,340 --> 02:39:16,460
really doesn't bring anything terribly exciting to the masses playing through each and every

2708
02:39:16,460 --> 02:39:21,180
launch title i can say for a fact that not one of these really do something unexpected

2709
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:25,460
with the marriage of these two technologies perhaps a year or so after launch there will

2710
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:29,340
be a handful of third-party titles that will push the envelope and do something daring

2711
02:39:29,340 --> 02:39:35,320
sadly nintendo certainly won't be leading by example for all of these excuse me for

2712
02:39:35,320 --> 02:39:39,140
all of these reasons i really find myself at a loss when attempting to justify this

2713
02:39:39,140 --> 02:39:44,860
purchase at launch or maybe at all sorry for the rant but that was the feeling i was left

2714
02:39:44,860 --> 02:39:50,500
with after two hours with the wii u and this i mean this guy is an uber nintendo fan because

2715
02:39:50,500 --> 02:39:55,220
you had to be to get in the click to go see the system right yeah but he said that he

2716
02:39:55,220 --> 02:39:59,820
doesn't he doesn't really stand for any console enthusiast enough well then he's kind of like

2717
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:06,820
any of us i mean i mean i like nintendo but i like sony and microsoft too you know some

2718
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:11,640
days it just depends who's pissing me off this week on a separate note i wanted to share

2728
02:40:59,740 --> 02:41:06,880
we have quite a few actually so uh i i expect a full report tap tap tap one more i'll do

2729
02:41:06,880 --> 02:41:10,020
one more and that's just gonna leave three left over we'll figure out what we do with

2730
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:16,380
those emails roll them over yep uh this is from nasty canasta evening olr crew among

2731
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:21,020
all the discussion about theaters pricing on your show bobby blackwolf sand around the

2732
02:41:21,020 --> 02:41:26,780
web i thought it was interesting that nobody considered to bring up the square enix tax

2733
02:41:26,780 --> 02:41:31,140
there have been instances where rpgs and related titles published by square enix especially

2734
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:36,980
rereleases have a price that is artificially raised above the norm take squenix's ps1 classics

2735
02:41:36,980 --> 02:41:42,840
catalog for example whereas most games are priced at 5.99 chrono cross chrono trigger

2736
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:48,220
all final fantasies and xenogears are worth nine are worth 9.99 to purchase oddly front

2737
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:54,780
know why that is you know why that is because you'll pay it plain and simple plane is i

2738
02:41:54,780 --> 02:41:58,140
mean i there there's really no other way to any any square fan is going to be this is

2739
02:41:58,140 --> 02:42:01,660
my own commentary any square fan is going to be cuckoo bananas about those games and

2740
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:06,140
i mean they're to be fair they're legendary larger games too because i know xeno gears

2741
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:11,740
was two discs yeah fantasy seven was three discs and file hasi eight was also three and

2742
02:42:11,740 --> 02:42:16,940
nine and chrono cross was two yeah so i mean yeah but i mean i don't know it's but yes

2743
02:42:16,940 --> 02:42:21,260
i understand this day and age that's kind of a weak argument oddly front mission three

2744
02:42:21,260 --> 02:42:25,580
and vagrant story do not have inflated prices despite both having rpg elements and those

2745
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:30,940
were more sleeper hits too or cult hits that is true for them um and those were also one

2746
02:42:30,940 --> 02:42:35,760
disc yeah i'm sure the tax also applies to titles available from nintendo's virtual console

2747
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:42,520
service at least in japan nasty canasta i love that name by the way and uh wasn't when

2748
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:47,660
secret of mana was ported to ios and put on the apple store wasn't it like really expensive

2749
02:42:47,660 --> 02:42:51,860
like it's four or five bucks which was outrageous for what it was just a port of the SNES i

2750
02:42:51,860 --> 02:42:57,420
want to say those games on nintendo and super nintendo virtual console were like 100 microsoft

2751
02:42:57,420 --> 02:43:05,260
points more or excuse me wow 100 nintendo points more i'm losing it tonight sorry i

2752
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:09,300
was distracted because look who came to say hello look who never comes out in the studio

2753
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:13,940
to say hello and look who's here it's maruko kitty kitty kitty do you have a comment maruko

2754
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:22,200
are you brown he's sniffing the microphone so how is your cat by the way um sanrio is

2755
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:29,180
doing much better she just needed a day to um have it basically she gets constipated

2756
02:43:29,180 --> 02:43:34,060
and when she has a really bad hairball and she's plugged up it'll tweak this nerve in

2757
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:38,820
her stomach and it completely like knocks her out for a day where she just she can't

2758
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:43,460
eat she's she gets dizzy if she walks she'll stumble and fall down she just needed a day

2759
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:50,260
to get better so kitty can't poop but she can poop now sorry for the tmi uh but yeah

2760
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:54,500
that it's really scary to see your cat like completely out of it you don't know what's

2761
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:59,020
wrong well and a really good friend of ours had to put down their cat this week and i

2762
02:43:59,020 --> 02:44:03,020
know that's like really difficult and it was it was a long time trying to get him better

2763
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:07,800
and figure out what was wrong with him so they finally had to it's yeah it's tough we

2764
02:44:07,800 --> 02:44:11,620
get really attached to our pets yeah so i love my kitty and i'm glad that she's better

2765
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:15,080
but i need to make sure that doesn't happen again because i don't like seeing her like

2766
02:44:15,080 --> 02:44:21,180
that um yeah that's it for emails all right let's get to the fus of the week it's the

2767
02:44:21,180 --> 02:44:25,460
part of the show where we rent why because we can it's our show

2768
02:44:25,460 --> 02:44:49,780
uh f you to people that change lanes without signaling there's a lot of you out there i

2769
02:44:49,780 --> 02:44:55,580
don't know why people do that it's really annoying um also f you to the steam sale for

2770
02:44:55,580 --> 02:45:01,300
i guess i should blame myself but i'm blaming the steam sale uh for having me spend way

2771
02:45:01,300 --> 02:45:07,860
more money than i i wanted to on this new sale and uh buying games that i i will probably

2772
02:45:07,860 --> 02:45:16,540
play but just right away and just adds more games to the list and then um yeah that's

2773
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:25,500
it uh alan you wanna go yeah on friday night my i have this gorgeous 25-inch hilt packard

2774
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:32,340
uh monitor for my pc the picture on it's amazing and on friday night it started to flicker

2775
02:45:32,340 --> 02:45:38,380
like there was maybe some emf interference from like a nearby appliance or maybe the

2776
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:42,340
backlight of the lcd was starting to go out which was terrifying because i don't want

2777
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:48,860
to buy a new monitor right now so that sucked but i replaced the i took it off hdmi cable

2778
02:45:48,860 --> 02:45:55,220
and i plugged it into my video card with a dvi cable and now it's fine so the hdmi cable

2779
02:45:55,220 --> 02:46:00,780
went bad so fu to shitty eight dollar amazon hdmi cables that make you think your monitor

2780
02:46:00,780 --> 02:46:04,740
is dead well you should have got a sixty dollar monster cable they're all the same just buy

2781
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:09,100
the cheapest possible cable yeah it was a belkin on amazon it lasted two years but i

2782
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:15,740
guess the hdmi cable went bad so f you to heart attacks that yeah over technology people

2783
02:46:15,740 --> 02:46:20,980
wholesale.com they're damn cheap and it's one day shipping to us that's where i get

2784
02:46:20,980 --> 02:46:28,540
cables when i get happy did they pay you for that ad no next time they should but they're

2785
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:32,180
so cal or actually no they're not so cal they're i don't know somewhere in the bay area or

2786
02:46:32,180 --> 02:46:37,660
something and so it's only my day not bad um i don't really have a lot of angst things

2787
02:46:37,660 --> 02:46:43,740
are going pretty good i i have a lot going on so fu to being really busy and i'm kind

2788
02:46:43,740 --> 02:46:47,260
of obligated to something over the next couple months is really gonna really cut into my

2789
02:46:47,260 --> 02:46:51,700
weekends which really stinks because i really need to like get back to san francisco and

2790
02:46:51,700 --> 02:46:57,220
see like grandpa warcraft and some other people over there and so on and fu to the fact that

2791
02:46:57,220 --> 02:47:02,260
the annual showing of showgirls which we must go to is the same day as another theater thing

2792
02:47:02,260 --> 02:47:08,460
i have here so i've got to make sure i can go because i love movie showgirls it's so

2793
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:20,380
bad it's good you don't know shit all right uh let's move on loki one more news story

2794
02:47:20,380 --> 02:47:24,540
for us then i've got something and then that's the part where we get to taking your calls

2795
02:47:24,540 --> 02:47:30,940
at 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge radio but after two more stories here

2796
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:38,780
so you can't go to both of those events because there are different places okay the same sorry

2797
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:44,380
i've seen that's good i'm happy you made a showgirls showgirls one too many times and

2798
02:47:44,380 --> 02:47:47,900
it was only because i want to see the boobies that's that's really the only reason to watch

2799
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:55,700
showgirls more than one time anyway so just saying um so let's talk a little bit about

2800
02:47:55,700 --> 02:48:00,060
kickstarter because why not we we always talk about kickstarter because it's in the news

2801
02:48:00,060 --> 02:48:05,140
all the time so a couple new games shadow run online i'm kind of excited about that

2802
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:10,180
because shadow runs pretty awesome um but they're starting a kickstarter they're looking

2803
02:48:10,180 --> 02:48:16,020
to raise half a million dollars by august 14th so you can go check them out at kickstarter

2804
02:48:16,020 --> 02:48:24,700
um i'd i'd be interested in seeing a shadow run game um that's online i've already backed

2805
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:30,440
the other one uh defense grid 2 if you're a fan of the tar defense games obviously you're

2806
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:35,740
probably familiar with defense grid um they're trying to get some funding for kickstarter

2807
02:48:35,740 --> 02:48:40,420
or from kickstarter as well they kind of went the whole penny arcade route where you know

2808
02:48:40,420 --> 02:48:46,400
they put the goal down as 250 000 but really they need 1 million dollars to fully fund

2809
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:51,300
the sequel otherwise you only get you know if they reach their goal of you know quarter

2810
02:48:51,300 --> 02:48:57,860
million dollars you get an expansion then if a half a million you get a remastered version

2811
02:48:57,860 --> 02:49:03,140
in the you know of the first game in the second game's engine and at you know three quarters

2812
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:08,180
of a million you get you know level editor and then 1 million you get a sequel it's kind

2813
02:49:08,180 --> 02:49:13,860
of lame but that's how they're doing it and then last but not least if you're looking

2814
02:49:13,860 --> 02:49:21,100
for a alternative to kickstarter uh the website games planet has launched a new service called

2815
02:49:21,100 --> 02:49:28,460
games planet lab it's basically a crowd uh funding service it's in the uk um which is

2816
02:49:28,460 --> 02:49:33,140
kind of cool because it's not us only because kickstarter is us only um so you have to have

2817
02:49:33,140 --> 02:49:38,580
you know a way to you know pay via amazon on that but it's based in europe and they

2818
02:49:38,580 --> 02:49:44,020
will have uh projects from around the world and uh already they've got a couple games

2819
02:49:44,020 --> 02:49:52,980
on um the service that you can fund one's magrunner it's a you know title from 3am studios

2820
02:49:52,980 --> 02:50:00,420
and uh it's like a first person puzzler game and then they've also got uh day one which

2821
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:08,100
is like an adult themed point and click adventure game like leisure suit larry uh they say it's

2822
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:15,340
uh heavily influenced by uh the devil's dictionary i don't know i've never never heard of that

2823
02:50:15,340 --> 02:50:21,660
so um can't really say i believe the difference so with this uh service as opposed to kickstart

2824
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:27,020
because i think one of the reasons uh people are kind of like i don't know about you know

2825
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:32,260
crowdfunding stuff you know how we know we're actually a game i think they have um like

2826
02:50:32,260 --> 02:50:38,460
a process that they actually kind of review these games before they you know allow them

2827
02:50:38,460 --> 02:50:42,740
to be on the service also it's only going to be games on this service since you know

2828
02:50:42,740 --> 02:50:52,040
it is game planet labs um so that's kind of neat i guess if they have that um so cool

2829
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:59,420
and so that's the alternative if you want to check it out it's i believe at lab.gamesplanet.com

2830
02:50:59,420 --> 02:51:08,020
want to say yeah lab.gamesplanet.com all right well uh since you just did a bunch of kickstarter-esque

2831
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:13,020
stuff here um this one is kind of another kickstarter inspired thing but like it or

2832
02:51:13,020 --> 02:51:18,020
not kickstarter is now kind of a part of pop culture right now and that's probably one

2833
02:51:18,020 --> 02:51:24,180
of those things that we'll look back on in 10 years and on the next vh1 i love the 2010

2834
02:51:24,180 --> 02:51:29,220
decade special you'll have you know someone there talking about how everybody was in the

2835
02:51:29,220 --> 02:51:33,700
kickstarter and the other stuff inspired and one of the things that kickstarter has inspired

2836
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:40,260
from namco bandai is nino starter and it has to do with the upcoming game nino kuni wrath

2837
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:45,020
of the white witch wizards edition we have talked about this collector's edition before

2838
02:51:45,020 --> 02:51:48,500
on the show and we talked about how it's going to come with the game and a 300 page book

2839
02:51:48,500 --> 02:51:54,500
a little doll and some dlc will all be included in this well now they're expanding this for

2840
02:51:54,500 --> 02:52:00,900
the us based on the number of pre-orders so it doesn't say though what they will keep

2841
02:52:00,900 --> 02:52:05,040
adding to it when they hit different levels but i'm going to the page right now which

2842
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:11,600
you can get at nino starter.com they don't say exactly what you will unlock but apparently

2843
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:14,660
if you hit these different pre-order goals they're going to add stuff to the collector's

2844
02:52:14,660 --> 02:52:21,420
edition which is kind of cool oh here it is the first one the first item is a set of five

2845
02:52:21,420 --> 02:52:28,740
nino kuni prince so little crappy little postcards basically you know if that's you know but

2846
02:52:28,740 --> 02:52:34,580
that's cool i like that they're adding more stuff based on the number of pre-orders that's

2847
02:52:34,580 --> 02:52:39,260
i kind of like that i gotta admit i mean it's so what if it's nothing that exciting it's

2848
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:43,680
still it's exciting to people that are really into this series i'd be all over this shit

2849
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:49,100
if warcraft did this you know what i mean so that's a cute a cute little thing that

2850
02:52:49,100 --> 02:52:53,900
kickstarters inspired yes yeah all right i think it'd be better if it was like the regular

2851
02:52:53,900 --> 02:52:59,860
game and you know the more people that pre-order the game like more free shit like they upgrade

2852
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:03,980
it for free like do a special edition or something like that and have crap that they throw in

2853
02:53:03,980 --> 02:53:07,740
there yeah that'd be a little bit better because collector's editions that's really a niche

2854
02:53:07,740 --> 02:53:13,340
niche niche audience you're you're not going to niche game with it now you know collector's

2855
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:17,020
edition that's going to be even more niche than that it's 99 dollars too if you want

2856
02:53:17,020 --> 02:53:20,900
that collector's edition fuck that well see here's the thing i believe it or not i'm tempted

2857
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:25,420
because i really do love you know the studio ghibli stuff and and the game looks good but

2858
02:53:25,420 --> 02:53:30,020
i just don't like i feel really weird taking that leap of faith when i don't really know

2859
02:53:30,020 --> 02:53:34,340
if the game's good or not i guess i could go a little japanese pretty good i know but

2860
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:38,340
just because it looks pretty good come on what have we learned sometimes games that

2861
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:45,100
look good don't really end up being very good or lasting a long time so i don't know but

2862
02:53:45,100 --> 02:53:52,820
i do think that doll is really cute though and the dlc might as well all right anyhow

2863
02:53:52,820 --> 02:53:58,140
uh we'll see we'll see if i get on board or not apparently uh you have until august 31st

2864
02:53:58,140 --> 02:54:02,720
to do this and they even have the little countdown clock there on nino starter.com it says right

2865
02:54:02,720 --> 02:54:09,020
now 2683 fans does that mean that many people are pre-ordered i'm assuming i don't know

2866
02:54:09,020 --> 02:54:14,500
maybe but uh little trailers available there and everything it's a cute little idea all

2867
02:54:14,500 --> 02:54:18,460
right we're going to open up the skype line at 1877 game olr or our username on skype

2868
02:54:18,460 --> 02:54:21,540
is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked

2869
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:27,420
about tonight or maybe there's a story you think we've missed the skype line is now open

2870
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:30,340
we'll get to last minute stories in a minute but i also want to read some of the tweets

2871
02:54:30,340 --> 02:54:35,340
that have come in at twitter.com slash olr and i'm going to start off tonight with a

2872
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:40,900
tweet from dave falcon tweets us and says a few days ago i picked up duke nukem forever

2873
02:54:40,900 --> 02:54:51,380
at game stop for $4.99 yeah wow my how the mighty have fallen and fallen quick would

2874
02:54:51,380 --> 02:54:59,980
you buy it for $4.99 no i'd be curious i got well maybe it was gearbox made borderlands

2875
02:54:59,980 --> 02:55:05,660
dude i understand that and it's really sad what they had to work with uh for duke nukem

2876
02:55:05,660 --> 02:55:08,980
uh that's i mean that was kind of one of the things too it's like they lost a lot of credit

2877
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:12,500
with that but borderlands 2 looks really awesome so all right let me go to the phones because

2878
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:16,260
we are getting a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is excellent

2879
02:55:16,260 --> 02:55:21,740
hey x-link buddy what's up nothing really too much hey loki i'm also hyped for borderlands

2880
02:55:21,740 --> 02:55:26,580
2 i'm so happy that ashley is actually going to have a role inside of it playing as tiny

2881
02:55:26,580 --> 02:55:31,700
tina which is absolutely great because i love watching uh hey ash what you're playing so

2882
02:55:31,700 --> 02:55:36,860
i i thought she was great doing those so it's going to be kind of intriguing to see uh how

2883
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:42,460
all that works out after after they uh bring everything to uh to it it's good to know too

2884
02:55:42,460 --> 02:55:45,740
that they actually have the game already done so hopefully they'll patch up any kind of

2885
02:55:45,740 --> 02:55:50,180
bugs or anything within that game so this hype train has me very interested with i'm

2886
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:54,660
a big big fan of the first one i have the first one with all the dlc and actually i

2887
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:58,620
would like to team up with some people go through the the arena part and get the rest

2888
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:02,920
of the humans i did the the first arena by myself but the other ones are just brutal

2889
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:07,780
after that so even with all my weapons i have so i swear i will try and play the game soon

2890
02:56:07,780 --> 02:56:12,700
i had to remove it from my hard drive because i needed the disk space but um it'll be back

2891
02:56:12,700 --> 02:56:18,500
uh really a couple things real quick chaos rings from uh square enix is 12.99 actually

2892
02:56:18,500 --> 02:56:23,260
on the uh is store right on the is store and then the sequel which came out not too long

2893
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:30,500
ago was actually 17.99 so those are really expensive compared to xeno gears and the rest

2894
02:56:30,500 --> 02:56:34,700
of those for 9.99 i'd rather get those anyways at least that way you know i would have a

2895
02:56:34,700 --> 02:56:40,820
copy i could always play um compared um you know because you know you know stuff happens

2896
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:44,820
you know this can break you know get scratched really easily um you know they're they're

2897
02:56:44,820 --> 02:56:49,020
very hard those are games also they were very hard to come by too you look on ebay you're

2898
02:56:49,020 --> 02:56:53,680
trying to find them they were going up to 50 70 80 a pop for some of those games so

2899
02:56:53,680 --> 02:56:59,340
um just to say oh well you know they're trying to you know gouge the price you know 10 bucks

2900
02:56:59,340 --> 02:57:04,460
it's a very simple price i'd rather pay 10 bucks than 50 or 60 you know wow yeah the

2901
02:57:04,460 --> 02:57:08,260
same thing it was the same thing with the seam sales you know i'm looking i bought uh

2902
02:57:08,260 --> 02:57:13,660
the dudgeon seed collection for seven dollars and 49 cents that was like 75 off i bought

2903
02:57:13,660 --> 02:57:19,020
a brink for five bucks i know that's a crappy game but i like these little person shooters

2904
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:22,460
from time and time after having a rough day of work coming home and shooting something

2905
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:26,620
it's really great to have some of this stuff and then of course i bought for my girlfriend

2906
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:33,620
uh the secret of the magic crystal for a dollar 25 so i mean you can't really beat those prices

2907
02:57:33,620 --> 02:57:38,020
for the for the sale so i'm looking at my ipad right now at the store and yeah i mean

2908
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:43,860
square really does charge a premium for some of their games final fantasy tactics 17.99

2909
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:49,740
yeah chaos rings 2 just like you said 19.99 on the ipad yeah i i'll pass on that you can

2910
02:57:49,740 --> 02:57:54,740
get imaginary range for free yeah i have my three i have my 3ds that can you know play

2911
02:57:54,740 --> 02:57:58,620
those games just some of those games just fine and you know i'd rather do it or something

2912
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:04,180
like that then you know i didn't worry about paying you know 18 19 bucks on a on an app

2913
02:58:04,180 --> 02:58:07,900
that when i'm middle doing something like you like you said basically for mass effect

2914
02:58:07,900 --> 02:58:15,300
3 is going to crash upon me you know i i pass on that so um oh it's absolutely 100 you know

2915
02:58:15,300 --> 02:58:20,220
bulletproof it's not going to crash or anything maybe but even then that's that's a considerable

2916
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:26,820
amount of money that's a big chunk so um especially since i have most of those games anyways and

2917
02:58:26,820 --> 02:58:31,180
it is everyone get the same thing you know i'm not i really don't feel like pay 17 18

2918
02:58:31,180 --> 02:58:37,500
bucks for it again i'm sorry so um and also about these shootings and you know they always

2919
02:58:37,500 --> 02:58:40,940
you know every time when some of this happens you know they're you know always blaming the

2920
02:58:40,940 --> 02:58:47,100
media some somehow whether it be video games uh movies you know uh music you know it's

2921
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:50,900
kind of weird they never mentioned books like what kind of books was a person reading what

2922
02:58:50,900 --> 02:58:55,780
kind of reading was the person doing to get to maybe even this frame of mind oh some books

2923
02:58:55,780 --> 02:58:59,780
are just as dangerous just as anything else some people still there's no moving objects

2924
02:58:59,780 --> 02:59:04,220
or anything within books excellent some people still blame books i mean you know granted

2925
02:59:04,220 --> 02:59:08,720
i'm getting a little historical here but fahrenheit 451 was a book ironically that was kind of

2926
02:59:08,720 --> 02:59:12,740
all about that and we still have this day and age you know people that try to ban books

2927
02:59:12,740 --> 02:59:17,080
from the public library you know what catcher in the rye always comes up on that list because

2928
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:23,340
yeah it's smut you know harry potter no but yeah yeah absolutely but you know what we

2929
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:28,660
need to do too is also look at the good stories look at the things i've done you know somebody

2930
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:32,940
saved you know a family or something from a building building you know maybe try to

2931
02:59:32,940 --> 02:59:36,740
try to twist out you know not really twist around a little bit maybe try to see if that

2932
02:59:36,740 --> 02:59:40,820
person is a gamer say hey look this person was a gamer this person just saved a family

2933
02:59:40,820 --> 02:59:45,380
you know he you know just because these people are gamers doesn't mean you know oh i like

2934
02:59:45,380 --> 02:59:49,940
halo and warcraft i don't go around you know decapitating people shooting people in the

2935
02:59:49,940 --> 02:59:53,900
head because you know i'm seeing this you know in the game and i'm going okay i think

2936
02:59:53,900 --> 02:59:58,620
this is okay you know it's what about all the good things gamers do do you know they

2937
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:02,700
always look for those little i understand me now i understand the way it works and the

2938
03:00:02,700 --> 03:00:07,500
way it runs i always i'm i help some local media outlets here and i understand that and

2939
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:11,300
it's always you know trying to get one step ahead of everybody else and try to look for

2940
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:17,580
that one little niche that you can go aha this is you know the reason though it's not

2941
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:24,180
even totally true but um you know m&m basically put it to words of best on the way i am and

2942
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:30,780
i love that lyric when he goes um they blame it on maryland and the heroin where will and

2943
03:00:30,780 --> 03:00:35,500
look where it's at and you know it's kind of funny because those little things it's

2944
03:00:35,500 --> 03:00:40,980
kind of like looking for that little niche looking for that little thing to to basically

2945
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:46,100
saying you know if these weren't here just what you know this would have you know would

2946
03:00:46,100 --> 03:00:50,380
never happen in the first place though it would and it's unfortunate too because it

2947
03:00:50,380 --> 03:00:55,540
you know happened in such a closed area but you know like i you know like you said before

2948
03:00:55,540 --> 03:00:59,540
i even after seeing these stories stuff happens i'm still going to go to libraries i'm still

2949
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:03,300
going to go to grocery stores i'm still going to go to movie theater watch my movies you

2950
03:01:03,300 --> 03:01:08,340
know i and i don't you know we should let these little things affect our everyday life

2975

hopefully it'll come back hey you still there uh yes we can hear you we're taping go ahead

2976
03:03:32,380 --> 03:03:36,380
and keep going with your question for the podcasties we're we're offline right now but

2977
03:03:36,380 --> 03:03:41,340
the podcasters are still hearing this so um i had asked you if there was anything that

2978
03:03:41,340 --> 03:03:47,920
you were wanting off of steam oh yeah yeah well i was like looking at um i'm tempted

2979
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:53,440
by amnesia and alan wake like alan wake won because i heard it's kind of silent hilly

2980
03:03:53,440 --> 03:03:59,300
and so i might like that and amnesia actually did i watched a group play through it and

2981
03:03:59,300 --> 03:04:03,020
i played like a little part of it myself but like there are some bits and pieces i missed

2982
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:07,940
so i should really get the full game but i don't know that game made me terrified at

2983
03:04:07,940 --> 03:04:11,540
some points like there's actually a video of me playing through it at one point and

2984
03:04:11,540 --> 03:04:16,780
i'm just like screaming when i do something blatantly obvious that hurts me and i don't

2985
03:04:16,780 --> 03:04:19,780
know it's a great game wait you're saying there's this video like it's out there on

2986
03:04:19,780 --> 03:04:28,260
youtube yes oh you need to give me the link uh okay here it's a video of like a bunch

2987
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:32,380
of people like in my group down at college we all get together and we play games late

2988
03:04:32,380 --> 03:04:38,260
at night and um that was one of them and it just has all the screen and you you film your

2989
03:04:38,260 --> 03:04:43,580
antics and put them up on youtube for your adoring public it wasn't me okay it was the

2990
03:04:43,580 --> 03:04:46,980
guy who was in our group he brings in his desktop and i even know this but he has like

2991
03:04:46,980 --> 03:04:51,900
a microphone sitting behind the desk that we're playing at and he's just recording everything

2992
03:04:51,900 --> 03:04:59,660
and so he takes the screen and then he like slows it down and it's pretty hilarious all

2993
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:02,580
right well while you're looking for that link for me is there anything else you want to

2994
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:10,780

2995
03:05:10,780 --> 03:05:15,340
my friend mass effect because he gets it gets really into it then he'll eventually get the

2996

are really funny i love the one that alan put on my wall on facebook of the guy playing

3004
03:05:58,860 --> 03:06:03,500
through amnesia where it just starts and like the first door opens he's like lol nope and

3005
03:06:03,500 --> 03:06:08,100
quits it's like a 10 second video all right let's go to the phones again and hope the

3006
03:06:08,100 --> 03:06:12,000
phone doesn't drop during the call hi you are on orange launch radio who's this you're

3007
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:18,940
such a hater about the mass effect 3 pc game it pisses me off how can you not be mad because

3008
03:06:18,940 --> 03:06:23,980
the xbox does the same exact thing you but you haven't no xbox hasn't robbed me of credits

3009
03:06:23,980 --> 03:06:31,180
yet it doesn't matter it robbed you of playing it on pc and that's a far worse offense what

3010
03:06:31,180 --> 03:06:36,060
what surely you didn't just call to complain what else did you call about um no actually

3011
03:06:36,060 --> 03:06:41,940
it was all complaining um because i'm mad you didn't play jack levin's theme during

3012
03:06:41,940 --> 03:06:46,300
that f-zero break when it's clearly the best song in the game the folks listening on the

3013
03:06:46,300 --> 03:06:50,820
podcast don't even know that we played f-zero music during the break i don't care they're

3014
03:06:50,820 --> 03:06:57,660
not special um they didn't get to hear f-zero music use an opinion of shane or shanes what

3015
03:06:57,660 --> 03:07:03,700
i'm just saying um anyway making sure the podcast listeners know you're a jerk there

3016
03:07:03,700 --> 03:07:09,380
you know that um and now i have to go find my copy of f-zero because i may need to play

long video oh good he linked me right to the right part good job osfer it's loading i'm

3029
03:08:19,060 --> 03:08:23,100
gonna have to wait for that to load it's buffering meanwhile we'll take one more call hi you're

3030
03:08:23,100 --> 03:08:27,820
on orange lawn's radio who's this what up guys it's zinek or the okc how you guys doing

3031
03:08:27,820 --> 03:08:33,260
hey i'm good how you doing zinek or hey no staying employed that's that in this economy

3032
03:08:33,260 --> 03:08:39,160
that's a hard thing to do yeah yeah actually i've been playing a hell of a lot of the streets

3033
03:08:39,160 --> 03:08:46,500
of rage v5 remake that got pushed out oh yeah did sega succeed in getting that pulled it

3034
03:08:46,500 --> 03:08:50,940
already escaped to the internet there's no stopping it that's right they may kill their

3035
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:57,080
own personal link but it's out in the wilds now that's very true so uh what made you decide

3036
03:08:57,080 --> 03:09:02,340
to play the play this remake you just love streets of rage dude they they did rearrangement

3037
03:09:02,340 --> 03:09:08,460
of usazuki's music what what version do you need you thought f0's music was good you put

3038
03:09:08,460 --> 03:09:12,060
that stuff on with real instruments and everything behind it it's amazing you want to put it

3039
03:09:12,060 --> 03:09:17,260
up in the club and just play all night so the soundtrack alone is worth checking it

3040
03:09:17,260 --> 03:09:21,340
out for that's cool yeah i ripped the whole thing it's already on my phone so i can listen

3041
03:09:21,340 --> 03:09:27,060
to it in my car when i'm driving awesome awesome yeah but it's actually a pretty faithful remake

3042
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:31,620
so it you know it's all pixelated and everything even if you make it full screen so it's almost

3043
03:09:31,620 --> 03:09:35,980
like playing on a on maim or something else like that but it's all custom so it did quite

3044
03:09:35,980 --> 03:09:42,340
a good job with it in fact that it's almost i i understand why sega might want to squash

3045
03:09:42,340 --> 03:09:45,980
it because it's almost a better version what they've been putting out for their games it's

3046
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:50,500
better than what they do to sonic in some ways exactly probably yeah i could see that

3047
03:09:50,500 --> 03:09:56,700
i could see that so uh what else is on your mind this week uh that's pretty much it i

3048
03:09:56,700 --> 03:10:00,440
mean yeah the steam's taking care of everything but they still can't lure me to skyrim until

3049
03:10:00,440 --> 03:10:04,140
they get a game of the year version so i can get all the dlc at once for one price thanks

3050
03:10:04,140 --> 03:10:10,180
very much there is no dlc on pc yet i believe uh the vampire dlc comes out when it's got

3051
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:15,140
to be really soon right yeah but they went sooner or later it will but i did pick up

3052
03:10:15,140 --> 03:10:21,340
the uh the uh arkham city dlc for three bucks so i played my two hours of that and was like

3053
03:10:21,340 --> 03:10:27,140
ah okay neat oh yeah that's right that just uh that was the big thing that was on sale

3054
03:10:27,140 --> 03:10:31,420
during the week too i forgot about that yeah almost all the dlc has their own little mini

3055
03:10:31,420 --> 03:10:34,660
sales you just got to go into the game to see them if they're not currently running

3056
03:10:34,660 --> 03:10:42,140

3066
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:30,100
let me uh read this real quick this is a link from tiger claw and i love this story microsoft

3067
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:39,260
had to apologize because a programmer hid the phrase big boobs in company software microsoft

3068
03:11:39,260 --> 03:11:44,700
apologized for the joke because it was an offensive string the computer did fix or did

3069
03:11:44,700 --> 03:11:49,660
fix the issue with a patch the offending code is within computer code that connects the

3070
03:11:49,660 --> 03:11:55,180
linux kernel to a microsoft virtualization product now apparently there's a string in

3071
03:11:55,180 --> 03:12:01,140
the hexadecimal computer language that says in hexadecimal big boobs if you can figure

3072
03:12:01,140 --> 03:12:05,940
out how to read it the code was spotted by programmers and caused controversy within

3073
03:12:05,940 --> 03:12:10,300
the community because of course they want to distance themselves from being just a all

3074
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:16,780
male pig-headed club but i don't know i think big big boobs is harmless that's funny i'm

3075
03:12:16,780 --> 03:12:23,620
sorry big boobs is funny even even women like boobs right yes if jamie were here she would

3076
03:12:23,620 --> 03:12:31,380
say yes trust me but they say oh it's childish humor da da da da da da da da it's just boobs

3077
03:12:31,380 --> 03:12:36,980
it's just boobs all right that's all i have for the tweets uh loki do you have any of
