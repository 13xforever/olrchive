Tonight, July 1, 2012, a full-time anime channel is console-bound, a classic edutainment title is set to become a movie, and one gaming company turns 40 years old.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming and have some lols and start 10 more years of the fun with my co-host.
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
Loki has curly fries.
I know, he always brings such yummy food and then waves it in front of us.
I think that he should give me one.
May I please have a curly fry?
Techmaster Loki here tonight.
What do you say?
Aw, he's handing one over.
Well, they gave me like small and a medium because they were out of large boxes.
So is that like jack-in-the-box math?
Small plus medium equals large?
Oh my god, grease.
Yeah, it's not worse.
Grease is truly the word.
Uh, joining us tonight, we have a special guest, um, somebody who hasn't been on the show in a while, but he's no stranger to OLR, but maybe some of you haven't heard him before.
Say hello to Alan!
Hello!
How are you doing?
I'm doing great.
Awesome.
Now, you're on the wonky mic tonight.
I might have to have you switch out, because I already heard some little crackle-shrackle.
So, yeah, chat, if I sound like crap, let us know.
Don't let me go through the whole show like this.
Or pretend he's a robot.
There you go.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
What's new with you since you were on the show last?
I don't even remember when you were actually on the show.
Well, you've made cameo appearances like one or two lines.
Yeah, I'll be in the office playing a game and then I will run out into the living room and just shout something that's relevant to the show when I'm not even on the show.
Does this microphone work?
It's not even plugged in.
It's muted.
I understand that, but would it work?
Yeah, in fact, the hissing is still happening, so I'm going to ask Alan to switch out the mic he's using and pick up that other one instead.
Let me actually mute that.
Live radio.
The choice of live radio at vognetwork.com.
Okay, try again.
Okay.
All right, you're just going to be a little quiet, so be sure you talk good and loud.
I'll turn up your gain a little bit, and that'll hopefully help.
Did you say you were going to turn up the gay a little bit?
No, the game.
Hey, girl.
Welcome to Orange Sound Radio.
What do?
Stop.
So I got a job in early May that has me working nights.
I work in a call center because it's an election year, doing political surveys.
And usually when OLR is taping for the last month and a half, I've been at work.
I get home at like 10 o'clock or like 9.30 when the show's wrapping up.
So...
Yeah, I got a little promotion, so I'm going to have later hours, but hopefully that doesn't start until next week.
So here I am, taking advantage.
So here you are, taking advantage of the week off that you have.
Yeah.
So, welcome.
All right, well, we are going to get in, of course, to all the news this week, or lack thereof.
Is it just me, or was it really kind of a slow news week?
I mean, when people are reporting on Twitter, that's usually an indication it's a slow week.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I want to read a conversation I was having with somebody online.
Now, I don't know this person super, super well, but they're a gamer and I'm a gamer, and I was kind of trying to figure out, okay, maybe there's a multiplayer game we play in common or whatever.
So I'm going to read this conversation that we have, and I want you guys to tell me what you think.
So he asked me, what games are you playing?
And I said, I've been stupid addicted to Mass Effect 3.
It's the first multiplayer game in a long time I can stand to play with strangers.
I just got into the whole series like three months ago, played all three games back to back.
And he replies, is that a first person shooter?
And I replied, it looks like one, but it doesn't really play like one.
On the easiest difficulty, your team does all the work for you.
I play a class that's more of a magic user, so I hang back, you know, I'm trying to kind of like put it in RPG terms.
JameemotionSick.com
First Person Shooters aren't real games, and the people who play them are not real gamers.
Those are fighting words.
Hold on, it gets better.
I replied, LOL, there's a big difference between Battlefield or Modern Warfare and Mass Effect, trust me.
No offense taken.
I know I'm a true gamer.
Happy face.
And the reply, LOL, if you say so.
I just feel fighting and first-person shooter games require no thought at all.
So yeah, LOL.
The amount of side-eye at this table right now, we're all just like, really?
Ask any of the people who play in the Street Fighter tournaments and how they obsess over their technique.
I was just really taken aback.
Well, anyway, I replied back.
I said, you know, I'm trying to be nice, but at this point I'm like, dude, what are you smoking?
So I'm like, fighting games is a pretty broad category.
I'm not very good at a lot of the modern ones, but in some ways, combat on the 2600 is a fighting game.
I'm kind of trying to say, dude, you're being ignorant right now.
So I asked back, I said, so what does make a real gamer?
No reply.
Of course.
Is this someone I know?
No, no.
This is people online.
You don't understand that you've been trolled.
No, I don't think so.
I think this person was very legitimate in their thinking.
But I was really surprised at how offended I was at that initial comment, like that first-person shooter players are not real gamers.
I don't play first-person shooters a lot, but I've played Quake.
I've played Doom.
I've played, you know...
Dictionary.com Gamer A person who plays games, especially computer or video games The end Do you play games on your computer?
Yeah, I was actually playing a couple earlier today Do you play games on a console?
But Jamie, one of them was a first person shooter
According to the dictionary, a gamer is one who plays games And you know, I played a fighting game before
I'm just trying to imagine this person playing Civ 2 or Civ 3 blindfolded with pins going into his body because the pain brings him closer to the experience.
So what kind of games does this person play?
I have no idea.
I asked.
I didn't get a reply.
I think this person gave up.
Because I'm just... Because clearly I'm ignorant.
Clearly I'm an idiot.
There's really all games out there have some sort of strategy or actual skill involved, except for pure random luck games like gambling a slot machine.
There's no sort of skill there.
So it's kind of stupid to say, oh, well, they're not really gamers.
Now, I understand that, yeah, you can get a lot of people button mashing first-person shooters and fighting games, but
Miriam Webster Dictionary Gamer A player who is game, especially an athlete who relishes competition A person who plays games, especially a person who regularly plays computer or video games
Marion Webster.
Now I'm going to try... What's the other one?
Webster.
Let's go to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show, live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate live here with our show.
And you can check in if you're listening live at vognetwork.com and get your points.
And I'm going to talk about check-ins in a little bit, but we've still got some ground to cover.
So reading from chat, I want to start with Burr tonight because...
This comment that he says here is it for me.
It's hitting the nail on the head.
Burr says, you're not a real gamer unless you only play what I play.
And that's, I think, exactly where this guy is at.
And I'm going to guess he didn't answer my question.
He's had a day and a half to answer and he's not answered.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I've been like, I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you.
Not really, but I'm gonna kill you with words.
He's wrong anyway.
He is, he is.
We have a dictionary definition, one who plays games.
And I would even expand on that, that there's tabletop gamers, you know?
We used to say, you know, when we talk about going to a tabletop game, we say we're going to game.
I mean, so it's the same thing.
A gamer is one who plays games.
Um, AcidicVampire in our chatroom says, seriously, tell that guy to play Bioshock and then we'll talk.
There's a really good example of a first-person shooter that's, like, definitely not Modern Warfare, Battlefield, like, you know... Or Portal.
Oh, yeah, Portal's a great... I mean...
And that actually doesn't make me motion sick.
Portal is an amazing first-person shooter, if you think about it.
Well, this is also exactly like, you know, you're not a real sports fan, you know, if you like hockey or soccer.
Football, though!
Real football.
Football.
I'm calling it soccer because I'm American.
I can do that.
I can be ignorant like that.
But we all know what I'm talking about.
Okay, so this guy is obviously often La La Land whatever.
There's a reason why I bring it up on the show, though, is because what is it about this gaming culture where we're so quick to judge other people and exclude them?
And I'm going to give you an example.
Going to our chat room, GameGuru says, The casual games are just extensions of genres from gaming's past.
For example, Bejeweled is a puzzle game like Tetris.
So GameGuru brought up casual games, to which I say, Alright, then Facebook games.
Sims?
They're kind of Sims?
Would somebody that plays The Sims Social and Cityville and Price is Right Slots, is that a gamer?
No.
The slots, no.
Because it's a slot machine type thing.
Well, isn't that a game?
This is how I look at it.
You have a gamer as a blanket, and then you have types of gamers.
You have casual gamers.
You have your RPG gamers.
You have your tabletop gamers, like I said earlier.
You've got your board gamers.
One who plays a game is a gamer.
It just depends on what they like.
But why do people feel the need then to assert that their way is the only way?
Because Catholics are like that too.
No, no, no.
I'm going somewhere with this.
It's like religion and politics.
Catholics think their way is the only way.
I'm using a blanket term.
The Southern Baptists, of course, think everyone else is going to hell.
It's that type of mentality.
We are better than you because you don't think the way that we do.
You have the Libertarians.
Oh, Lord, let's not go with the Libertarians.
You have the Socialists.
You've got Republicans, Democrats.
Everyone thinks that their way is the best, and anyone who is not in their group is immediately inferior because they're not in that group.
Alan?
My theory is, he's insecure, he's caught shit for the games that he's played before, he now has a support group, and he's old enough to play the games that he likes to play, where he doesn't give a fuck, and he doesn't get catch shit for it anymore, but he's still, because he's built that support group of like, these are the games I play, these are where my friends are, he's still got that insecurity, he only wants to relate to people that...
play the same stuff as him.
That's actually a fascinating way to look at it because you're essentially saying the reason why he's like that is because it happened to him in reverse.
That's essentially what you're saying, right?
Yeah.
He's insecure and he's got some lingering issues.
And I could see that.
He's caught shit for playing the games that he likes to play, but now he's fine.
But that's still his safe space.
I could totally see that because back when it was all about Dance Dance Revolution for us and so forth, there were people that said...
All they talk about is DDR.
It's not a video game show.
It's a DDR rave lights show.
Lights don't come through radio.
And I know that you love this game, so this is a bad example, but think back when you were crazy about DDR and someone was like, oh, I love music rhythm games.
And you're like, what?
And they say Parappa.
And you're all, okay.
He plays Parappa, guys!
Oh, here's a good example.
In the groove.
I'm just kidding.
I'm not going to fan those plays.
Let them die.
No, in the groove was fine.
I'm not even going to go there.
Just walk away.
Porkchop in chat asks, Sky, is this guy young or old?
It's a bit of a juvenile opinion.
Mid-twenties.
That's kind of mid... Especially nowadays with, you know... Nowadays, those whippersnappers... Basically, a lot of the people I interact with on forums that are of the teenage age range...
are pretty immature, and I can imagine that they, unless they finally grow up, that they kind of continue to go that way through their mid-20s.
It's like everybody's a decade behind nowadays.
Well, I think at the end of the day, if you guys are going to, you know, judge other people based on the games they play, just kind of, you know, watch yourself.
Watch yourself.
Because we're creating this cycle, right, where now, you know, that person that we point our fingers at will turn around and do it to somebody else.
It's like we should try to be more inclusive, right?
Am I being too much of a hippie?
Yeah.
I don't want to meet this guy because he's an idiot.
Yeah.
Bow Chicka Wow Wow
So this person is in the mindset where everything is right now, everything is immediate.
You don't like what I like, so I don't care about what you like.
What's in front of me is what's important to me.
And, you know, I'm sure that all of us understand that once you hit your 30s, you kind of don't give a crap about that kind of drama anymore.
So it's not as important.
I guarantee you this person, when he's in his 30s, is going to say, man, I was stupid.
It's like pulling up your live journal from six years ago and going, Oh God, I did that.
I wanted to go back in time and shoot myself.
All right, look, we got to move on with the show.
I just, you know, I was so struck by that conversation.
I was just like, oh, my God, I've got to bring it up on OLR.
And the one thing I did want to say, when I was talking to that guy, he did not know that I did this show, like that I've been doing it and so forth and where I'm coming from.
But it's, I don't know, it's kind of funny.
It pays to do your research, individual.
Facebook stalk me next time.
All right.
Moving on.
Let's talk about our gaming weeks because we're all gamers here at OLR and so are you guys in our chat room.
And if you're listening to this on the podcast feed, you must enjoy video games enough that you want to hear a bunch of strangers online talk about it.
And DDR Dollar Bill, I can't go back in time and shoot myself because I wouldn't be here.
So maybe I just smack myself around and then use that little men in black thing to make me forget.
You would have to be a looper in order to do that.
All right.
Gaming week.
Star Soccer.
Why don't you start us off?
You said something about being holed up in the Normandy.
Yeah, I was hanging out in the life support room and in the battery.
Were you getting it on with Dr. Chakwas?
Because that's what I've always wanted to do.
No, but it's funny when you go drinking with her and she starts doing the whole dancing thing.
It's pretty funny.
Blackwolf in our chatroom says Garrus isn't a gamer.
He plays some games.
Alright, moving on, moving on.
But yeah, I've been playing, I started Mass Effect 2 last weekend and I'm at the last set of missions now.
So, I haven't beaten a game that had that much stuff in it that quickly since Final Fantasy 6.
Or 3 when it was out.
So, that's saying something.
No, I take that back.
I played Dew Prism pretty quickly.
And the DLC, it's all really good, right?
They were all enjoyable.
Oh, hell yeah!
and yeah they were saying that the Overlord one was supposed to be like two and a half hours you said it was like two and a half hours
I took Samara, by the way, not Morinth, because Morinth was a bitch Which is the right thing to do, let's be real
Yeah.
But I have seen the Mournth seduction scene and that was pretty funny because dude Shep is just stupid.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Bad voice acting.
I'm totally going after Garrus but I have a save file to where I can go back for Thane if I wanted to.
The end.
So now I have to go buy Mass Effect 3 tomorrow.
Mass Effect, Mass Effect, more Mass Effect.
Loki!
Wait, wait, I did play some WoW for five minutes.
You gotta get use out of that annual pass.
Yeah, well I logged in so I wouldn't get kicked out of the guild.
Actually, I'm switching it up because I know Loki's about to go on a rant.
So let's go to Alan first.
Alan, how was your gaming week?
It was all right.
I checked in on my Minecraft world.
I have an article that I need to finish for VOG about Minecraft.
I'm playing in survival mode.
I finally found a world that has a terrain that I like.
And I'm playing on survival mode where you have to eat and there's supposed to be monsters, but I have it on peaceful.
And I thought, I'm going to play it on peaceful until I find a good cave and I build my house.
But I'm so into the exploration and creativity that every time I flip it from survival to easy so that the monsters will spawn, they just irritate me.
It's not like I'm afraid of dying.
It's like I'm trying to build an expansion in my house.
Fucking go away, creeper.
So I just turn the monsters off.
So maybe the whole combat aspect of Minecraft isn't for me.
I don't know.
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
I'm trying to unlock all the characters.
I've been working on my dude Paragon Mass Effect 3 because I've already seen my FemShep Renegade ending like a couple weeks ago and I logged I checked out Dragon Age 2 to see how long I had spent on it because I haven't touched that game since February and I had spent 14 hours and I deleted the save so I could start over because I don't remember a goddamn thing
And that's it.
Those are my three games.
All right.
Can I talk about how I obtained Mass Effect 3?
Yeah, actually.
Because it was legal, but it was one of those like, hmm.
I think Loki might remember this story, but a couple months ago when Battlefield 3 came out, there was this scandal where people had bought codes from overseas, like the China edition of a code for cheap, and EA wanted to disable the codes, something like that.
I don't remember that.
Okay.
Well, I was trying to price hunt Mass Effect 3 for Origin, thinking maybe Amazon or Best Buy or something had a code.
So I went to Google Shopping and I just said, Mass Effect 3 sale, Origin code.
And I found a site, and I'm not going to say what site it is because I don't want it to sound like that OLR is endorsing this.
But you just told everyone how to find it.
Sorry.
Yeah.
All right.
I get the code within a minute of submitting it and it's a little PNG file.
It's literally a scan of the code that you get on the back of the jewel case if you bought it.
I put it into Origin and it worked fine and then in Origin it says Mass Effect 3 Standard Edition US slash UK slash RU so it's some like European code.
So this site just bought a bunch of overseas codes in bulk.
I didn't have a problem with it.
Or picked them up out of a box that fell off a truck.
Well, actually, it depends on how the DLC goes out to the retailers because there's been times, and I still have hundreds of them left, that they will send you an Excel sheet with codes listed.
Okay, here's all the... You guys have X amount of copies that you've ordered from this company.
Here's the codes for your PS3 copies.
Here's the codes for your 360 copies.
Some of those may be going to rental stores or libraries or people that don't need the DLC codes and so there's a bunch of excess left over.
Now, I don't know about the ones that would be included in a package or whatever, but a lot of that stuff that goes to GameStop or even small mom and pop retailers, there could be a bunch of that stuff lying around out there because people didn't need them.
So I can play multiplayer fine on the official EA servers.
I'm not worried about the SWAT team rappelling down and crashing through the windows or Origin spontaneously just turning off my Mass Effect 3.
But yeah, I took a risk on one of these sites and spent $22 for a $59 game.
And I'm not saying I would do it again, but I didn't have a bad experience.
It worked out fine for me.
interesting see I'm trying to figure out like where does when I showed you the site because you're considering getting Mass Effect 3 for PC so that you could play with me which I ended up getting through Best Buy when they had a sale and you looked at the site and you're like honey this looks shady as fuck and I was like well I did Google the name of the site plus scam name of the site reviews to see if people have bad experiences and it looked legit so that's why I went for it but yeah there's something about the whole concept of buying overseas codes domestically for that cheap is weird but
Keep monitoring your credit card statements.
That's all I'm going to say.
That's why I use PayPal.
I wouldn't use my credit card.
I hope it was just excess copies in Russia or something that got unloaded on this site.
I really hope you don't get screwed.
We'll see.
I would never advise somebody to do that.
You're taking a huge, huge risk.
I know you obviously very well.
You weighed the pros and the cons and went for it.
Do you think you would buy another game this way?
Or do you think maybe it's worth the extra $10 or whatever next time to just have the peace of mind it's a legit place?
I would buy it through a legit or more legit like an actual game client like Steam or Origin or Amazon.
But because I'm so broke right now...
I absolutely wanted to pay money for the game.
I was just like, how cheap can I do this?
And I found a way that worked.
Well, and there's actually, on Amazon right now, there's a seller selling a boxed copy and everything for $28, and you pay $4 shipping, although I could pay $39 on Amazon right now and buy the boxed copy and get free shipping.
So, if I don't see it cheaper, it fries, pretty much.
Alright, well thank you for sharing your story Let's move on and talk about Loki's Gaming Week Which, as I understand from what we heard at the end of Bobby Blackwolf's show Was a little bit controversial, right Loki?
Well, yeah, some of it So, I played lots of Minecraft, which is part of the course Finished my Demon Head entrance to my volcanic lair type thing And it looks pretty awesome
Although one gripe I have about the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is, you know how you take screenshots and stuff and you can set your gamma settings so that you can actually see it on your TV?
It doesn't adjust for those settings when you take a screenshot.
So it was completely bright on my screen, but completely dark in the picture I took.
It's kind of annoying.
They should make it so that it shows what you have on your screen.
Um...
Then I played more Modern Warfare 3 and that was fun.
Still kicking ass.
Hopefully, they're supposed to be releasing a new free map soon for Terminal, which I believe is a remade Modern Warfare 2 map.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and all of them were supposed to be retro challenges kind of tied into like the whole, you know, book because it was all about, you know, old retro 80s games and stuff.
I mean, one of the challenges they had was, you know, playing Joust against this, you know, computer player and, you know, Zork and God, I can't remember the third challenge.
I think it was playing music or something.
Anyways, so stuff like that.
DarkSakura.com
The second gate, however, not quite along those lines.
Instead, it is go play this game that's created by Richard Garrett, the guy behind Ultima Online.
He's traveled the space and all that fun shit.
Ultimate Collector Garage Sale
Um, it's, of course, one of those free games that you would see on Facebook that, you know, nickel and dime you for every goddamn thing that you want to do in it.
And that's no different with this one.
Um, and it looks kind of like The Sims, but there's already people that have completed this challenge.
Um.
And I can tell you right now, having played this game for about four hours, there is no way you can do that in that time frame without paying money to get extra dollars or whatever to be able to cycle things faster, give yourself more energy, and that kind of thing.
So basically, they bought their way through this game.
And it's definitely proven in the screenshot of the first person that did finish it.
He had two credit cards sitting there right next to his computer monitor, so...
It's just kind of a really bad vibe.
I mean, they went from this really cool retro game challenge thing to, hey, play this Facebook game.
You know there's fucking money switching hands there.
And yeah, it's kind of cool that they hid some stuff in here, but I've played this game for, like I said, about four hours, and I've only come up with maybe two of the items I'm supposed to be finding for this thing, and there's like about, I think, 50-some items that you need to find.
And it's all random.
So there's no... I'll be lucky to finish it within a month's time, let alone knocking it out in a day, which I was hoping to be able to knock everything out in a day or so, because get a jump on it like I didn't quite do with the first gate, but...
It's really disappointing that this is what it's come down to, is that they have this crappy Facebook game.
And I hate playing Facebook games, or at least this type of game, where it's like, oh yeah, you know, you want to rummage through that box, well it's going to cost you one energy.
Oh, you don't have energy right now?
You can pay some money to get some energy.
Or hey, you don't have enough money to buy that upgrade.
The type of competition you guys are playing, that was a terrible idea.
It really was.
There's no skill in this.
The skill in this is having the patience to fucking wait this long.
They gotta pay for that DeLorean somehow.
He can pay for it with his book sales money.
I mean, he didn't have to do this.
Maybe the next contest will be getting to play Tabula Rasa, the other great Lord British game.
No, I shouldn't kick him when he's down.
Obviously, the Ultima series was phenomenal, so important to gaming history.
And I don't blame him at all.
It's not... You know, so what?
He wants to create a Facebook game, that's fine.
I have no problem with him creating a Facebook game.
I have a problem with him using this Facebook game in the state that it is.
It's not finished.
Using it to further this contest.
And yeah, it's cool that they hid all these different items in this game.
But it's not done.
It's buggy.
When I first started playing it, I ran into a glitch where I was selling stuff in my garage sale.
And the items disappeared.
And then those racks that I was using, I couldn't put anything on them.
And you're limited to a certain amount of racks that you have in your garage sale area, I guess.
and so it was stuck for a few days and I couldn't do anything.
And then they finally fixed it and then they had people having trouble logging into the server because the server was down because too many people were hammering it and then there was an issue where the link from the actual contest to the Facebook game was broken.
It's just as a... It's bad.
And I don't like, you know... I just don't like the way it's being handled right now but...
I'm still going to play it because I have to in order to get to the next gate or at least be able to be in the running still.
So it's just sad that I have to do this the hard way, whereas I see these guys, yeah, I beat it in four hours.
But it won't matter at the end of the day, right?
You just have to clear it in 30 days, right?
I just have to clear it within 30 days, but I just hope the last gate isn't anything like this bullshit.
Yeah, that would be a real stinker on the competition.
Yeah.
So that's that.
Anything else for your gaming week?
I think that's it.
Alright, so my gaming week.
A lot of the same old stuff.
I've been playing Mass Effect 3, a little bit of World of Warcraft.
I can't think of anything new that I tried this week.
I went back to a game from a couple years ago just because I just had an itch to play it and that's New Super Mario Bros.
Wii.
I don't know.
I just never finished it years ago.
I got really close and never finished it years and years ago.
So, I just went back and played it a little bit, and I was like, oh, it's actually a pretty good Mario game.
I forgot, like, how much of the Mario universe, not to be confused with the game, they kind of brought into this game.
So, you know, the fact that there's Yoshi and Fire Flowers and Ice Flowers, but anyway, it's an old game.
Either you've played it by now or you haven't, or you're waiting for the next one on Wii U, like I'm sure Loki is with great anticipation.
Okay.
So I promised a little while ago we could talk about a game that I've been playing that I didn't tell a lot of people that I was going to go play because it just kind of happened.
I've been having the codes sitting in my Steam account for probably about a year now because Alan trolled me.
when he used to hear me talk about this game an awful lot and he said, oh look, it's on sale on Steam right now for just like $9.99.
I'm going to buy these codes for you just to kind of troll you a little bit.
It was when the finances were better and all that stuff and we could throw $10 at each other to troll each other with stuff.
But I never used it.
I'm like, I'm too busy playing these other games.
I'm not going to go back and play this game.
I don't have the time to sink into this crap because this game is such a time sink.
I don't have time for it.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And I gotta tell you, yes, a lot has changed The game is drastically different Let me put this into perspective Loki, I know you played Final Fantasy XI for a long time So I know you'll be able to speak this language, you ready?
Do you know what I accomplished in three days of light gameplay on Final Fantasy XI?
No, what did you accomplish?
I am level 25 White Mage with a Black Mage subjob already leveled.
And I did the subjob quest.
That's pretty awesome.
It might have been over three days, but you and Nikolatov have been playing a lot in the last three days.
So don't say, like, casually in an hour.
You gained five levels.
Well, yes.
Once we figured out what we were doing, yes, it has been that fast.
I guess the thing is now, one of the things that was implemented in the game that changed things drastically is they put in these things called field manuals, which are these books that sit out in the open.
And you do what's called page burning.
You take a page and it'll say, kill six worms.
So you go out, you kill six worms, and you get bonus XP and you get bonus skill once every real world hour
I'm sorry, you get the bonus XP every time.
You get bonus gil and this other thing called tabs once every real world hour so that way you can't just be getting it and getting it.
So what people do now is one of the zones, Gusken Mines, one of the book burns is kill six skeletons.
So people go into parties there at level 10 and book burn over and over and over, just pull skeletons over and over in alliances of 18 people just pulling these skeletons over and over
and level, level, level, level, level, level.
You're just gaining levels that fast.
And apparently, you do it in Gusken Mines, you do it in Crawler's Nest, you do it in one of the dungeons, and you're all the way to 75 in a couple days.
That's what, like, the leveling game is gone in Final Fantasy XI.
It's just you sit there and collect XP.
People go AFK and just sit there and collect the XP.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
No, there isn't.
You get the XP every time.
Six skeletons, XP.
Six more, XP.
Six more, XP.
You get the gill and the tabs once an hour.
That just makes me think of that Eddie Izzard sketch.
You have crossed a bridge, champagne!
You have entered a shop, champagne!
You've left a shop, champagne!
You have fallen into a ditch, junk, champagne!
There actually is a zone called Sarah Magoo Champagne.
I just made a Final Fantasy XI joke.
I'm done with that game.
Anyhow.
Alright, so anyway, that's... Oh my god, something just popped into my head.
What?
A Mass Effect MMO.
Wouldn't it be awesome?
It would, but... BioWare, do it!
BioWare did the Star Trek MMO and it's having issues, so they've got to clear those up first.
Could I play an Elcor monk?
That would be great.
Anywhere.
Anyway.
That's really it.
I'm going to try to do some more writing for VOG and kind of write my thoughts a little bit more and put some screenshots up there so you guys have an idea of what's going on.
I've had a couple people in chat saying, you should go back and try it.
You should go back and try it.
A lot's changed.
Alright, so I finally went back.
I was slow in doing it.
It's like Jamie playing Mass Effect finally.
Took me a little while, but now that I'm doing it, yeah, I'm enjoying it.
Am I going to leave WoW for it?
No.
The only reason this is catching on right now is because there's not a lot to do in WoW right now.
But once the panda people hit, I'll probably be saying bye-bye to Final Fantasy XI.
A lot of it is really about the people, and I just don't know people in Final Fantasy XI.
Druid Guild.
We need a Druid Guild night.
All right, let me know when.
Anyhow.
I would not play a Turian, but I would romance a Turian.
Answering Tigerclaw.
I would play a Drell.
Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Although I haven't played it in years, I used to love Final Fantasy XI.
It has changed a lot, and I guess in some ways for the better, in some ways not for the better.
So, anyhow, that was my experiences with Final Fantasy XI and my gaming week.
All right, let's move on.
Housekeeping tonight.
I want to talk a little bit about something new on VOG Network.
First off, thank you to everybody.
The full website has been launched for 30 days now, and I can't believe it's only been a month.
It feels like it's kind of been a lot longer than that, but maybe I'm thinking about the temporary site we had and all that.
But the first month of VOG Network has been very successful.
Bobby wrote a whole little summary with number crunching like mad.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I want to make this clear.
For now, it's being tested.
We're calling July a test phase.
So it's only available on certain VOG shows.
It's only available on Bobby Blackwolf, our show, and it will be available next week on Understation Live.
That's it for right now.
But in the future, hopefully it'll work and we'll be able to roll it out to more shows in the future.
How the podcast check-ins work is that at some point throughout the show, and it's never going to be in the same place because we know how people like to work the system, at some point during the show, you will hear a little pre-recorded message.
And you know what?
For the podcast listeners, I'm going to make tonight's very, very easy.
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase ZONE.
Now for the live listeners, you didn't get to hear anything right there because this is for the podcast.
This is something they're going to have because you get to check into the shows when they're live.
But for the podcast, for whatever that word was that you just heard, you're going to go to vognetwork.com and you're going to put that word right there underneath the leaderboard and you'll be able to check into the show, get the same amount of points that the live listeners get for listening live.
Because the point is, live, podcast, you're participating, we still love you either way.
So we want you to get the points either way.
Now, if you listen live and you check in on the podcast, you're not going to get the points twice.
Sorry, we just thought that would be too much of an unfair advantage to the individuals that have the time for both.
But you might want to still consider doing it anyway if you do happen to listen to both or you listen to part of one and go back and listen to the podcast later.
I would encourage you to do it because it's still being tracked in case one day there is show specific loot for example we might give you some loot if you check into the podcast and the live show three weeks in a row or something like that I don't know hypothetical we haven't designed any of that yet
So, there you go.
That is now a feature that is available to you guys at vognetwork.com.
Podcast check-ins.
Trying to make sure if I'm forgetting anything.
I don't think so.
I think, again, it could be at any point throughout the show.
I'm not going to explain it every week.
If you want more of an explanation, one is available at vognetwork.com.
Right next to the little box where you put in the password to check in is a little thing that says, What's this?
and Bobby Blackwolf wrote a great little summary on the website at vognetwork.com and if you're listening live and you have no idea what the hell this is all about you're missing your chance buddy to collect some points and maybe some loot go to vognetwork.com register for the site and whenever we're live as we are right now you're going to see a link that says right there on the front page on the left side participate now and get points and you go and you get points for checking into the show super easy
Okay, I think that's that.
Let's move on with some gaming news.
I need to throw this out there, though.
Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, Google+, search for Orange Lounge Radio.
There you go.
Let's get into some actual gaming news.
Loki.
So, let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And the Wii U, Nintendo has already come out and said, Hey, you know what?
The Wii U, it's not going to be this really expensive system.
It's going to have a reasonable price.
And basically, Satoru Iwata, he said that the...
The initial price point of the 3DS was considered relatively high by consumers and that they won't make the same mistake with the Wii U. So I don't know.
What do you think?
I was privy to a little something Is this Secret Club?
Do we need to say don't tell other people this?
That you heard it here?
I don't know I think I've covered my Alright, let's go ahead and just make sure If you're going to tell other people this big piece of information Loki's about to share You didn't hear it here
Well, some of this is what it means.
So, the Wii U, I think, is a reasonable price.
It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.
There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with.
What's in those SKUs?
No idea.
What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.
So the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99.
So there's that.
The next price up, $299.99 and then $349.99 are the three different price points.
Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely speculative.
I don't know for a fact this is what it is.
249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.
So system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now, you have all those Wii remotes and... Go on the online shop and enjoy.
Yeah, nunchucks, done.
There you go, you've got a system, you're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.
299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then additional Wii Remote Plus and an Unchuck, kind of like the Wii had.
I bet it's going to be that other controller, the Xbox-y controller.
They'll throw that in, and I think that...
You give yours and then I'll give mine.
Never mind.
I'll shut up.
And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the GamePad controller, the Wii Remote Plus, the Nunchuck, and another pack-in game.
Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land.
It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.
Here's my guess.
I could be completely wrong, but I'm going to throw it out there.
$249.99, Bare Bones System.
$299, that's the one that's going to come.
Bare Bones System, Classic Controller Pro, or whatever that thing is called, and Nintendo Land.
I say you get the pack-in game at $299.
$349 will be, it will still have Nintendo Land, but it will not have the Classic Controller Pro.
Instead, it's going to have two Wii U tablets for all the games that don't use them.
700 bucks, blow up Miyamoto doll
Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September.
But there are the price points.
Release date is probably going to be the 18th of November.
So, hey, you figured it out two months before they're going to actually announce it.
So that's that.
I think it's somewhat reasonable.
Yeah, actually $249 is kind of lower than what I thought.
Not going to get one still, but it's... Has Nintendo launched with multiple SKUs like that since the original NES, which also came in three SKUs, funny enough?
I don't think so.
So, no.
And that's all I know of right now is that they've got three price points because that's what they want projections on unless they're shopping price points and seeing, okay, how many of this one are we going to sell?
How many of this one?
I don't think that they're like, we don't know what to charge for this.
$349 is way too much, I think, for the system to be out right now.
The thing that's going to be interesting, though, is that gives Microsoft and Sony enough time to where I think they could drop their console price again by the time that comes out.
And $249 would not be that much of a stretch.
That's another $50 price point.
I think it's another $50 drop.
Or are they $199, $299?
I can't remember right now.
They may be $199, $299.
or it could be onboard storage.
This system has more storage than this system.
Although, I mean, I wouldn't pay $50 more for onboard storage.
The Apple approach?
I don't know if they're going to do that.
Interesting.
I don't know.
We'll find out soon enough what they're going to be throwing in there and when it will be available.
But we have a pretty good hunch of what might be in there and when it might be available.
Did you talk about the online part yet?
Nope.
Online is going to be free.
And thank God, too, because like we've seen so far, we have no fucking clue what they're doing online.
So yeah, free sounds good.
I mean, because honestly, I haven't seen anything offered on it that was anything more than what's on the Wii.
Aside from, hey, now you can put forum posts on games and stuff.
You know, which...
Hooray?
I don't know.
Do you think they might go the route that PlayStation Plus went where, yeah, it's free, but maybe if you do give us money, we'll give you little freebies?
Because certainly there's enough of a back catalog of virtual console crap that they could give that shit out like candy.
They could do that, but I don't think they're organized well enough to do that right now.
That may be something that comes way later on.
I just think they're too late to... Something is not in the show world tonight.
I know they made a major hire this week with somebody from Disney Studios is in charge of their online now.
Disney had that unique thing that they did a while back where it was D Gamer or something like that.
It was kind of like their online hub thing.
They had avatars and stuff like that, and it was tied in with their DS Disney games, which probably no one remembers any of that stuff.
That was kind of cool and the offerings that they had in there were pretty cool.
But I hope they don't go that route because it was really stupid.
Doesn't Disney also have some fairly popular online games like Club Penguin I know is a pretty big deal.
And then like Pirates of the Caribbean.
I know their games are really big on having the phrases already there and you can only pick from those phrases to communicate with.
Like you can't type in your own stuff.
At least to keep it safe.
Cool.
Once again, I don't want to have this so chopped off at the balls, I guess, where it's...
Why would I want to buy a brand?
First off, why am I going to buy a brand new system that basically is as graphically powerful as my current Xbox 360?
Yeah, it may edge it out a little bit, but I don't think they're going to be really utilizing that.
I don't think you're going to see games on a Wii U right now that are going to be like, wow, that looks so much better than the Xbox 360 version.
You're not going to see that.
Actdeft brings up another good point in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
It says, Where's My Water is pretty awesome.
And that's right.
That reminded me.
I forgot.
Disney does have a pretty big footprint in the iOS app universe right now as well.
With that Nintendo thing being a tablet where you can be able to play games on it, that seems like an interesting little connection as well.
Because obviously Disney has the Where's My Water.
They have a couple other games too.
I know they own the TapTap brand now too.
That's all Disney.
I just, I don't know, I don't have very high expectations for them.
They're also supposed to be in September, they're supposed to be talking about 2013 titles for the Wii U, which honestly, I think that's, it's too, it's too early to be talking stuff for next year.
Is this the Parallel Tokyo Game Show conference they'll do?
I don't know, it's another one of their, like, five billion press conferences that I don't fucking care about because...
Like, seriously, just get all your shit out at one time, not this, well, today we're gonna talk about the first three digits of the price, and then maybe we'll have another press conference to talk about the last few digits, and then we're gonna give you the day of the week that the system's coming out, this press conference, and then the next we'll talk about which month it's coming out, and then maybe the hour or another, I mean, seriously, they waste so much fucking time with this stuff.
I mean, that's fine People keep talking about it They're like, hey, people keep covering our press conferences That's how you do it Yeah, but people keep covering it because they're like, wow, you didn't really announce anything That's fantastic that you didn't announce anything Very important
Well, you know, when there's not a lot of gaming news, you know, that's a great time to have a press conference.
Or it's a great time to report on people's Twitter activity.
And that's what I want to talk about here is game director Katsuhiro Harada.
He is the director of Tekken.
And he posted a very interesting rant this week on Twitter.
Now, I always thought Twitter was restricted to 140 characters, but he wrote a whole little essay on there thanks to...
TwitLonger, which apparently is a thing, twitlonger.com.
And he put this whole little rant about people who constantly tell him, switch back to the voice actors used previously.
I guess he's pretty pissed off about it.
He said in this, I'm going to quote some parts of this rant here on TwitLonger.
Quote, Quote, Quote,
Some might just say, just pay them to reuse the voice data, but often the voice actors decline this, or their agency declines.
Even so, some people said it is a different voice in Tekken 6 than the original.
It can't be helped.
They might think that.
Then he goes on to talk about the whole conversion process and so forth.
But I love this.
He says at the very end of this, he says, quote, After this lengthy explanation, I will be quite surprised if there are still people who still don't get it.
Thanks for understanding or not understanding.
Whatever.
Bro, you mad?
You real mad.
I guess this is starting to get to him.
But I can see where he's annoyed.
I can see where the fandom is like, don't change it.
It's perfect.
Don't change it.
Tekken 6 sucks.
I want Tekken 1.
I want the voice from Tekken 1.
But he does make a good point.
You have to license those voices every time.
And sometimes they say no.
I was going to say, voice actors can step out on a green light to cross the street and get hit by a bus.
What are you going to do?
People die.
I mean, what do they want?
You have to find replacements sometimes.
And honestly, if you like the voice acting better in Tekken 2, go play Tekken 2.
That's a good point, but I think the problem is too many people are playing Tekken 2 and not enough are playing Tekken 6.
Tekken 3 was the best.
Oh wait, here's another great quote.
I have even complied to the request of you all spamming me to bring back characters from previous installments.
You often say, let's show the dev team how sincere we are by buying two copies if they bring back character X. But did you really go through with it?
Expecting you to at least pre-order the game, I was met with more spam.
After you apparently didn't notice that June and Michelle actually returned.
I still have some characters left to be revealed that will comply with some of your requests, even bringing back several others.
Even so, none of them are paid DLC.
I will continue to sincerely comply with fan requests.
However, I can't continue to engage the negative ones that, without knowing what you are talking about or even thinking about when you're saying blindly repeat, bring back, bring back, bring back.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I kind of wish more people would tell off their fan bases.
That rant kind of makes me want to give Tekken 6 another chance, because we did try playing it, and it was kind of booby.
I didn't care for it.
Was that 5 or 6?
Wasn't it 6?
I guess, I don't know.
It was 6.
I've lost count.
It was 6.
I only had it via Gamefly for a day, but yeah, it was probably 6.
Anyway.
Alright, let's move on with some other news.
DarkSakura, we need to stop reporting on Twitter activity.
Okay, well, if it's any surprise, this is about Mass Effect 3, which no one's surprised, especially Rob, because he gave me the story.
Thank you.
Yeah, the Extended Cut DLC was out, and everybody is happy.
Well, okay, not everyone's happy.
There's still some people who are like, meh, which I had to stop myself from watching it, even though I watched some of it.
Okay.
Okay, so going forward, they're actually talking about already doing more download content that they're working on it right now.
So it was teased in a tweet that in regards to more download content, it said, that's a trick question, we'll save the future DLC for future chats.
Don't worry though, there's much more.
Mass Effect 2 had a DLC cycle that was a year and a half because Arrival came out I think March or April of 2011.
I think so.
It was a 2010 game, Mass Effect 2, so yeah, they need to, you know, DLC for the multiplayer would be nice and then what happens to Omega with Aria and there's definitely campaigns they can add.
I really hope the Omega thing.
I'd love to see more Aria.
I really hope they got Carrie Ann Moss to do additional dialogue so they could do that.
That would be great.
Well, given that I've only done a little bit in Mass Effect 2 of going to Omega, yeah.
So anyway, I kind of, I mean, I won't have much more of an opinion until I get into Mass Effect 3, but there's little side characters that I kind of liked that I wouldn't mind...
I'm all about extending the game's life with DLC.
BioWare said, they're not changing the ending.
They're going to just give you further details on the ending they made.
That's exactly what they did.
Although I understand they changed one thing.
There is one, well... They added something.
They added a big something that some people say is a giant F you to the fan base, and I say, deal with it.
I thought it was great.
And they did change some other things that they got called out by continuity cops.
Yeah, so apparently my big thing of wondering, this is just what was cleared up for me, that my big thing of wondering what are all of those Turians going to eat got fixed.
So I feel happy about that.
They made some stuff very clear.
Very clear.
Yeah, and as far as them adding details, it was a lot of details.
I think it left enough people satisfied that the people that are still furious about it are being brats.
But the content that we got on Tuesday should have been in it from day one.
It's not that spectacular where we can go, look, dipshits, it wasn't that hard.
This is good.
This should have been in the original product.
that's kind of the consensus overall that I'm getting from most people is that I'm happy with this I wish it had been this way the first time and if it had been there probably wouldn't have been as much butthurt and I'm okay with that for me it will be in it the first time there you go
and you know I think a lot of fans patience is a virtue a lot of fans should realize there are a lot of people like Jamie that still haven't played the entire series and you know Mass Effect will continue to kind of grow in the fans and so forth I will say this because this isn't really a spoiler
One thing I noticed they did add at the very, very, very end after the credits and after everything is they put a little pop-up message that says, you know, thank you for playing Mass Effect.
We really appreciate all your feedback and your comment, you know, kind of the PC thing they have to say, over the years.
And we hope you've enjoyed Mass Effect 3.
We can't wait to, you know, see you for whatever Mass Effect has in store next type of thing.
So they do basically say, this is not the last Mass Effect.
They don't say Mass Effect 4, but they basically say...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Well, Arrival is also truly a bridge between 2 and 3.
And it was the very last DLC to come out.
Mass Effect 3 starts immediately referencing what happens to Shepard in Arrival.
See, that's what I had heard.
And so that's why I thought, okay, that's good.
I mean, it's all stuff that ties right back in.
So I'm pretty happy.
I mean, I get to play through Mass Effect 3 with the true ending.
I mean, in my head.
You'll never experience that hurt again.
Keep in mind that some of it got spoiled for me.
I'm going to punch you so you can experience some of the hurt.
That's okay, Rob.
I'm fine with not being punched.
All right.
Vandy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, referencing something you brought up earlier, Mass Effect MMO.
Who knows?
I would quit WoW in a second for a Mass Effect MMO.
I don't think it's in the cards for BioWare after what's happened to Star Wars.
I mean, if Star Wars can somehow be salvaged, maybe, but... It should just be converted into Mass Effect MMO.
No!
No, it should not.
They can do better, even better.
Well, I meant take the base engine and futz with it some.
Alright, let's move on with more gaming news.
Loki.
Alright.
So let's talk a little bit about the future.
And this is kind of cool.
MercurySteam, the team behind the Lords of Shadows game.
Yeah, it's part of Castlevania.
Because, you know, they didn't think it could stand on its own.
They're ready to basically call it...
move on from the Castlevania franchise after the new 3DS game and Lords of Shadow 2.
They said, well, I think it's about wanting to leave a legacy, and I don't want to be in charge of a series that perhaps over a certain time is going to decline.
I'd rather go out with a bang and leave our legacy in the Castlevania universe.
And then, of course, they also said they don't want to be known as Mr. Castlevania, and...
Should Lords of Shadow 2 be very successful, they'd have another team do a sequel.
Of course they were teasing that perhaps Contra is the next series that they will work on.
That'd be pretty cool.
New Contra game.
I'd like to see Contra make a comeback.
Contra should make a comeback.
But it's one of those games, like, it could easily be so fucked up.
Like, they could really botch it bad.
But, I mean, you know.
What was it?
Was it Contra?
Would they call it on the Xbox Live Arcade one, the anime?
Oh, Hardcore Uprising.
Yeah, Hardcore Uprising.
That was pretty rad.
I liked that one.
So, even though that wasn't really Contra, but it was.
Well, yeah.
I mean, Hardcore Uprising is basically Contra.
I think it did have some of the music.
Anyway, if you like that anime-style look to Hardcore Uprising and some of those other online games, maybe you are an anime fan.
And maybe you'll be excited to hear that Viz Media is launching a subscription-based service called Neon Alley.
And it's going to be on consoles this fall.
It's a 24-hour anime network.
Viz Media is the localization company that did stuff like Bleach, Naruto, and a lot of similar things.
Taking it way back, they did Ranma.
Yeah, so they brought all that stateside.
They've already said it's going to cost $6.99 a month.
It will not be an on-demand streaming app, which I find kind of strange because people are paying for it, but I guess they're taking the HBO approach.
It will be an actual TV channel with schedules and all that stuff, uncensored content, HD, but it will always be dubbed in English.
I don't care anymore.
This is the other thing.
There will be advertisements even though there is a subscription fee.
The ads will be limited and they're there to keep the cost below $10.
Some of the programming coming to the channel.
Naruto Shippuden, Inuyasha, The Final Act, Death Note.
Those are all coming to this network.
But they don't say exactly what consoles or how, but I guess we're left to assume it would be very easy for it to be a PlayStation 3 app akin to the Netflix or Hulu Plus or Vudu or any of that stuff.
and then we have on the Xbox 360 obviously those content channels are very easy to make and we've seen a lot of those so it'll be a Comcast-esque style channel still very interesting because I can't think of any other on-demand channel that's run like an old-school TV network that's only available on a game console very interesting interesting to see what could be in the future
You know what?
I'm still going to stick with fansubs.
Would you pay $6.99 a month for VOG TV?
Well, yeah, because we're far superior.
And we'll play it in Japanese.
I don't care.
I know you would think if it's all online, it would be super easy to just have one channel in English and one in Japanese.
That seems, you know, that's weird.
I don't like Laserdisc.
Play it in digital or analog.
Exactly, I think.
Alan, I know you're in anime.
In fact, you know way more about it than I do.
I used to be.
You used to be, but you... Okay, just the other day, I'm telling this on air, we were at a Sanrio store and there was a Sailor Moon backpack and you pointed at it.
Yeah, because it reminds me of when I was 17 and not quite out yet, but clearly gay and Sailor Moon was awesome.
It's pretty.
You know what?
We should just marathon the entire thing from beginning to end.
I need to convert my awesome fan subs of the last three seasons I have on tape to something digital.
I've got rips of them.
Yeah, Rob.
Would you pay $6.99 a month for this anime TV with commercials in English only?
Given that I haven't really watched anime with any type of seriousness in like 10 years, no, but...
From 98 to about 2003, fuck yeah.
I just remembered what the last series I actually paid to have shipped to me from fansubbed was, on tape, was Mamote Shugogeten.
Was it worth it?
Well, I had watched a lot of it raw, because a friend of mine taped some off the TV for me, and then I watched most of it, and then it came out in the US, and I was like, well, crap.
I hardly ever watch anime.
I think the last one I watched, seriously, was a vampire.
Was it Helsing?
Helsing, maybe.
I think it was the last one I watched.
We watched that over at Jessica's Old Place after watching Shock Treatment.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
With the projector that Evan had hooked up.
I remember that.
I have boxes of Laserdiscs.
you know what we need to do have an anime convention but like not restricted to anime we need to just have a convention where it's like everybody just fucking show up here and we're gonna do awesome things and if you don't like it get the fuck out you know what I take that back you know what the last series I actually downloaded everything was Supernatural
Oh, because they have anime, yeah.
And it's done by Studio Madhouse.
It's an OVA, right?
It's like a miniseries?
No, it's like a whole season of stuff.
And the X-Men one, which was really good.
Because I think that was also Madhouse.
But anyway.
GTFO con.
If you don't like it, GTFO.
But be proud of me.
Be either proud or sad for me.
I broke out my Gatchaman episodes from 1972 and was like singing along with it because I will always sing along with the Gatchaman theme.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, there's a game that's been announced for PC, but it was originally a smartphone game.
It's called Death Rally.
It just has the best name ever.
So it's being rebuilt for the PC with a new engine, camera, new controls.
Well, of course, it's going to be new controls since it was a phone game before.
And it's going to have a new track and the Shadow Man from the 1996 version.
So you should see it on Steam for $10.
Death Rally Universal Healthcare
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates coming to a country near you.
Possibly Finnish release dates.
We might cover that in a minute.
But first, the U.S.
Did you know that's true though?
That as far as like international happiness level, Finland was rated number one.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Don't do that.
This is awesome.
Very cool.
We had Fushigi Yugi like this for a while back in the day.
Every episode of Fushigi Yugi.
The Secret World, which is a new MMO being launched.
That's coming out on PC.
That looked interesting.
That could be the Jack.
And then Theaterhythm, Final Fantasy for the 3DS.
Thanks for watching!
Rhythm Thief
I don't know.
Chatters, what do you think?
Which of those games sounds more exciting?
Secret World or Theatrhythm?
I want to know.
Live.vognetwork.com Meanwhile, Japanese release dates.
Let's talk what's happening over there.
July 5th, a little more exciting in Japan.
On the Xbox 360, Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon gets a price reduction.
Max Anarchy is a new game from Sega coming out on the 360.
And there's also Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier comes out in Japan as well.
Yeah, I really wish I was coming out over here.
Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns over here.
I was going to say, it's Anarchy Reigns, right?
Yeah, I got delayed next year.
Oh, wow, really?
Yeah.
So you're going to have to import it, I guess, if you want to play it.
Because it is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week, which, as you know, PS3 is a region free, so if you really wanted to play it, you could.
Other games out on the PS3 this week, Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Tactical Assault Commander 3 gets a price reduction, or it's, I guess, the camouflage version?
Oh, no, that's $129.
That's not a price reduction.
I don't know what that is oh this is a never mind you know what that is that's a freaking uh uh it's one of those little uh mech warrior mouse slash number pad slash draw it's one of these things look it's one of those it's not a game it's a peripheral that has the mouse but it's for the ps3 which is interesting so it's definitely for um more tactical based strategy games
Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City get price reductions in Japan this week as they are released into the PS3 The Best Collection looking at the handhelds real quick on the Vita you have a game called Dokuro comes out this week I do not know I'm trying to think what this game is over here I thought I saw a preview for this and I can't think of what this is called over here I've seen this somewhere yeah
Nightmare Before Christmas Nightmare Before Christmas
Lastly, on the 3DS this week, there are some more peripherals, but as far as games go, we have Sekaiju no Meikyuu 4 Denshu no Kaioujin comes out this week, and that is a game where you make your own character and set up a team of explorers and go through labyrinths.
Hey Rob, it's an anime.
Is it?
Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan.
Oh, thank you.
Dokuro means skull.
Maybe that's why it looks familiar, is that like I've seen like a cartoon version or something on YouTube.
Alright, and lastly on the 3DS this week, Danball Senkai Baku Boost comes out this week from level 5.
This is, I believe it's... I think it means skull.
On the 3rd, The Secret World And on the 4th, Rainbow Moon, which makes me now think of Sailor Moon Thank you, Alan On the 6th, we have Beat the Beat, Rhythm Paradise Test Drive, Ferrari Racing Legends And Theatrhythm, Final Fantasy
Some feedback on the release dates from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Stan says, I want to play Max Anarchy Bayonetta's in it S is the guy from Mad World He's one of the main characters in it In fact, I think a lot of the characters from Mad World are in there I want to say a lot of the villains are It looks interesting Why isn't Bayonetta 2 already a thing that came out in Japan last year?
That's a great question.
Why is that not a thing?
It's because the developer probably wants to make it, but I don't think it was profitable.
I mean, it was somewhat profitable, but it's still a niche title, but I think that they totally would do that.
Because it's the guy who left Capcom Platinum Games.
It's his studio that made it, and they're working on something else big now.
Metal Gear Rising.
Okay, yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC just came out this week and apparently it is really buggy
A bunch of the PC users have kind of gathered on the Ubisoft forums and made a bug report for them.
Letting them know, you know, what exactly the issues are.
And, you know, apparently it ranges from everything that, you know,
I don't know.
It's just kind of bad, I guess.
I don't know.
I'm not much of a PC player.
I would have thought, though, they took the extra time to get the PC version right.
I mean, because this game came out back in May, and the PC version not until the end of June.
And so now they just kind of, eh.
I don't know.
Test your shit.
I mean, seriously.
They literally have broken it down.
They've broken it down.
Hardware compatibility, input, FPS resolution, graphic issues in game, online, audio, menus, and other.
Why is it that these companies treat gamers like they're beta testers and not like they're fucking...
You know, customers.
I mean, that's stupid.
Because we let them.
We pre-order anyway.
We didn't know those tires fell off of the car.
I mean, if we had driven it, we would have surely noticed that that was the case.
Your steering wheel only turns to the left.
Well, that's unfortunate.
Thankfully, our track, you know, we turned to the left.
And so, yeah, that's.
Well, now we talked a little bit before about anime, and I may not be the biggest anime fan in the world, I mean, it's alright, but one thing I do love is I love the stuff that comes from Miyazaki and all that stuff.
So you know I'm looking forward to Ni no Kuni, which is the, or I guess that's already out in Japan actually, but the English translation is coming out soon.
Finally, soon, and in Europe, there is going to be a Wizards edition that comes out, and it's going to have a copy of what's called the Wizards Companion, which is the spellbook used in game.
There's a Drippy doll.
It doesn't actually drip.
Drippy is the little character that comes with it.
You get some other DLC stuff with this.
And that will be out when the game comes out on January 25th.
And some good news, it was announced for North America shortly afterwards.
However, you can only get it on Namco's online shop at store.namcobandaigames.com It will set you back $99.99.
But I gotta say, looks pretty awesome.
I'm really looking forward to this game.
So that's one I'll be playing early next year for sure.
Ni no kuni.
I think I'm sort of past that phase where I'm buying special editions of just about everything.
Yeah, me too.
And I hate the DLC stuff.
I think my burn phase was when I bought the Cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast, paid 90 bucks for a plate and a clock and a fork and a spoon.
And a pillowcase.
If the collector's edition is $10 more or $20 maybe tops and it's a series I really love, then maybe.
But you are asking me to take a big risk here on Ni No Kune.
Sometimes this collector's edition kind of bombed too, like the Tron video game.
I see this collector's edition still on clearance.
It's been almost, it's been what, a year and a half since the movie and the game?
So people are still trying to unload those collector's editions.
Even popular ones like Halo Reach and stuff.
That's true.
A ton of those.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, let's go back to a time when things were simpler.
And we didn't have $400 collector's editions of games or games that come with leather jackets, which I think was a thing a couple weeks ago.
DarkSakura.com
Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
Ninja Gaiden for the NES.
Specifically, the NES version.
It's hard as fuck.
In Japan, it was called Ninja Ryukenden, which is Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword.
And in Europe, it was Shadow Warriors because there was this big taboo about using the word ninja.
For example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles over there.
There you go.
I know my stuff.
So, it was a little platformer where you beat people up and chopped them in half with your sword.
And it was ported to the PC Engine.
Actually, let me start back.
It came out in December 1988 in Japan, March 1989 in North America.
and September 1991 in Europe.
There was a PC Engine version in 1992 and a Super NES version as part of the Ninja Gaiden trilogy in 1995.
And there's been mobile phone versions with episodic content.
And it's now on the Virtual Console as of 2007.
So you play as Ryu Hayabusa, who we might also know from Dead or Alive and the current Ninja Gaiden games.
So he's learned that someone named the Jackio plans to take control of the world by using demon power.
Ooh.
So you have to go through, and you go through all the different acts, and you have 20 levels, and it's hard.
Hard, hard, hard, hard.
More than that, the big thing is that it had such an elaborate story, and used cinematic cutscenes, you know, as far as an 8-bit system could handle.
Which were epic as fuck at the time.
Yes, they were.
Seriously, seriously.
And it even had a novelization done in... Oh, it was one of the FX9 books, wasn't it?
Yeah, The Worlds of Power.
Oh, that's right.
And he actually kind of had something to write off of.
He had to just make shit up for games like Simon's Quest, where the story for Simon's Quest was really strange.
But yeah, he actually was able to keep the Ninja Gaiden one pretty close to the cinematics.
Yeah.
So, I mean, basically, it's just, it's super hard.
Like, this is a game I haven't beaten.
You know, you can use shuriken, you can use your spiritual strength power, you also get shuriken that work like boomerangs, you get different types of things that will freeze your enemies, the fire wheels, you know, all kinds of neat stuff.
And even with that, no one can beat it.
Sorry, it's impossible.
Just won't happen.
I know people who have beaten it.
But I don't think Dan's beaten it.
I've gotten to the last fucking stage and there's a jump that is so hard like it was controller throwing, rage inducing Alan knows what I'm like when I'm mad and that was one of them that made me mad it's like you would jump if anyone wants to see the best rendition of how every gamer feels playing this game look at the Angry Video Game Nerds little video about this game that is everybody playing this game
My one difficult NES game triumph is that I beat the original Ninja Turtles NES game, which also has a rep for being hard as hell, even though it's an American-made game.
I beat that twice, and all the other times I couldn't get past the final boss, but yeah.
And Ninja Gaiden is harder than that, so that's some scary shit.
Well, it was developed by Tecmo, and another series back in the day that Tecmo did was Rygar, which I don't know if I've done on Classic Game before, but Rygar is a pretty good game.
Of course, Tecmo Bowl.
So, this one also had an arcade version that was a beat-em-up, but they weren't really ports of each other, they were kind of different.
And the developer said that the term ninja was gaining popularity in North America, so that's why they made the game with the ninja.
And actually, the NES version was developed by Hideo Yoshizawa, who was listed as Sakurazaki in the credits.
So you can see that if you look at the arcade credits and the NES credits, completely different development teams.
So, basically, that's where the differences came in with the two versions.
So, it's just really supposed to be more like you're playing a manga, is what they were going for.
That you were involved in the story of the game as well as playing the game itself.
So, because the game's title was actually too difficult for English audiences, that's why they changed it to Ninja Gaiden.
And they were going to call it Dragon Ninja, but Ninja Gaiden just worked.
And it actually literally means Ninja Side Story.
But it's not intended to be a spin-off of the arcade version.
God, I remember these bosses.
Some of them were hard as fuck.
The first two were like easy mode, but then the third one is like, ah.
Sorry.
Super Nintendo Compilation
Well, this game had so much featuring in Nintendo Power in 89 and 90.
It was on the March-April 89 cover and referenced in Howard and Esther.
I used to read a bunch of Howard and Esther.
Just saying.
And it was also in the May-June 1989 issue.
It had complete walkthroughs.
There was stuff in the Counselor's Corner.
It debuted number three in the top 30 list for July and August in 89, just behind Zelda 2 and Super Mario 2.
You know what they need?
Reg and Nestor.
No.
Just sayin'.
So, I mean, basically, going back from this in 2004, Tecmo did episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for the AT&T and Verizon phones that used the Brew and Java platform.
And the second installment was going to be released in North America, and it just didn't come out.
They didn't keep up with it.
and um you know that magazine that Dan and I are into Retro Gamer which is a UK magazine um they did a review um and a look back on Ninja Gaiden in uh the March 2004 issue when the 2004 Xbox remake came out so I mean
This game has really spawned a legacy.
It gave us, you know, you keep going and it's given us, like, we have characters that are alive, we've had, and going from that we've got the newer versions, which some are good and some are not, and the big glowing red scarf.
And there's also soundtracks.
You can get the soundtracks.
The first one came out in 1989.
So there you go.
There it is, your classic game of the week, a real classic, Ninja Gaiden.
On the NES, not to be confused with the arcade version, which I personally did not care for nearly as much.
It was just too different, as you touched on there.
But I seriously recommend to everybody, when we're done with the show, go watch the Angry Video Game Nerds version of this.
And then play Ninja Gaiden.
And then play it.
And play the sequel.
And then scream.
And play the third one.
Because the second one introduces the Shadow Ninjas, which weren't in the first one.
I would like to see how bloody knuckles people get from punching the wall while playing this game.
AcidicVampire in our chatroom says, Heard the most recent Ninja Gaiden is shit.
Yeah, that's what I heard too.
I tried not to get into the new series as much, but I hear they're hard too.
Is the latest one 3 or 2?
I think it's 3.
Because each one got released like 3 times with the Black Omega Ultra Hyper Edition.
Well, I remember it was a big deal because it was on Xbox.
The first Xbox.
It was a big deal.
All right.
Anyhow, we're going to take a break so we can do break-type things like refill our drinks and all that stuff.
But don't go anywhere.
There is plenty more to go when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to have the Fugle Question of the Week, of course, your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR, Rapid Fire News.
And you know what?
Last week, we didn't get to do any of our big segments because we were busy celebrating with the 10 years and everything.
So I think we should play a game tonight.
So we're going to do listless tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Stay tuned.
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live on this Sunday night, July the 1st of 2012 with the 463rd episode of our show taping live at vognetwork.com.
If you're just now joining us live, well, hello.
Come on by the chat room and say hi at live.vognetwork.com.
and if you're listening on the podcast I hope you didn't fall asleep when I was talking about podcast check-ins earlier because now you can get VOG points just for visiting vognetwork.com log it in and put in your password you might get some loot you might but we don't give away all the secrets on how to do that
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here in the Fugle Question of the Week and all that good stuff.
But first, Alan, you're here on the show tonight, and I always like to let the guests plug things.
I know you don't run a website of your own or anything, but you do have something you do want to plug tonight, yes?
Yes, I'm selling off more video games.
eBay batch.
So I was selling off duplicates, now I'm selling off stuff that was once, you know, normally something I wouldn't part with, but makes some extra money.
No one's obligated to bid on it, but I thought the OL Army might want to see what I have up for grabs.
I'm going to put a link in chat.
Excellent.
So eBay games.
What kind of stuff are you selling, just to kind of give the impression?
Most... Almost entirely handheld stuff.
Game Boy Advance is the bulk of it.
Am I not coming through on audio?
No, it's just... The chat room, sometimes you guys send me mixed signals because... And you guys in studio, don't... You're like a psycho girlfriend.
I don't want to sound mean, but don't always take what chat says at face value.
Multiple people have to say it before it's an issue.
And then when you guys get in on it because one person's saying it in chat, I get really confused.
Two people have to say it in chat before it's really an issue.
Because like...
I don't know.
I can only see the little waveforms going here.
So I could tell Alan's mic was off.
And I'm sorry.
I ran away to turn on a light somewhere else.
So I didn't see that his stuff wasn't getting through.
Yeah, Rob.
But anyway, now we got it.
So I just totally ruined your plug.
But that's what I do.
I ruin your life.
That's my role.
So how do people find your auctions?
There's a link in chat right now.
It's a goo.goal link.
And also if you check the OLR Twitter feed, I don't know if you RT'd it, retweeted it, but if you check the Orange Sons Radio Twitter feed and just scroll down if you're a podcast listener listening to this, they end Thursday nights.
You've got four days.
I didn't retweet it on OLR because I was like, ooh, I shouldn't use the business thing for that, but it is on my personal Twitter.
I just retweeted it at twitter.com slash S-K-I-E.
Yeah, so check Sky's Twitter.
It should be a couple posts down.
Okay, awesome.
Do we get some of the games named already?
Sorry, I got confused with it.
Some of the games that you are selling?
Oh, I haven't listed any of them off, but let me do that real quick.
I wish you had told me about some of these first.
I would have just given you straight up cash.
Final Fantasy 5 and 6 Game Boy Advance.
Those are the ones that have extra maps and espers and job classes.
Advance Wars 1 and 2 bundled together.
Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, Force Hordes, Game Boy Advance.
Final Fantasy 3 DS.
Final Fantasy 2 PSP.
Final Fantasy 4 DS.
Elite Beat Agents.
uh Super Smash Brothers Melee GameCube and Final Fantasy Legend 3 for Game Boy that game is 20 years old I didn't tell you to name them all goddamn I'm just kidding it's fine all right I got going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com rdgsing says do we get a discount if we mention OLR at the eBay checkout uh no and I have to make sure make make very clear this money is going to
Alan, this money is not going to OLR.
Yeah, this is not some VOG fundraiser.
This is me just selling games.
But he can plug his stuff because he's sitting here on the show tonight.
However, I will say this.
If you do mention OLR at checkout, we will throw in something small.
Like, we'll throw in something from the OLR vault here.
Just a something small little trinket.
Maybe an autographed picture of myself.
and I just want I'll give you something better I just want Acidic Vampire to know that Final Fantasy 6 is super awesome but I'm never gonna play a Game Boy Advance again and Final Fantasy 6 is available like for other different ways so plus I have a Super Nintendo sitting right over there and I'm pretty sure there's a Final Fantasy 3 cartridge somewhere which is a pretty decent way to play it yeah I realize it has the wrong number in front but you know what deal
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick news stories tonight.
Loki.
So this shouldn't come as much of a surprise since we were just talking about all the trouble with the PC version of Ghost Recon Future Soldier.
But yeah, Ghost Recon Arctic Strike, which was going to be the expansion for Future Soldier, has been delayed.
It's not coming out this week like it was going to.
Um, they're citing polish as the reason to hold it up.
Yes, the polish or, hey, let's not release it with a million bugs like we did with the PC version.
So, gotta have to wait.
Um, there's a new LEGO MMO coming.
Hopefully this one will last a little longer than the last one.
and it is coming from Funcom so they kind of know their way around an MMO and they haven't really said exactly what this MMO is going to be but they have some Lego minifigs online and it's going to be based on that franchise I didn't realize they had so many different Lego minifigs they actually have one with like bunny ears and stuff and a little red riding hood it's kind of crazy um
Family friendly game and it's going to be coming out at some point.
Lego minifigs.
Well, since it didn't work the last time.
And then last but not least, there is a big action movie coming out this summer.
It doesn't feature Batman, but it features a whole ton of 80s action stars, including Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff like that.
The Expendables 2, and it is coming out as a video game, which was kind of leaked out before.
I think it was on the Germans rating board and stuff like that.
But it is going to be a PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade game and PC game.
Coming out probably around the time of the movie.
It's a four-player co-op shooter.
I don't know.
It looks neat.
I'm trying to see if this is more of like a... I think this might be like an arcade-type game.
Like a time crisis or something like that.
and obviously it's based on the movie which I saw the trailer for not that long ago it's not like Time Crisis but it's like NOM it reminds me of the NOM game that they had on Neo Geo where you have your character run across the screen it's sort of a shooter but not do you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character?
I don't know if you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character seriously, fuck that guy
Valve
You want to make some more in-game movies?
Things in Team Fortress 2, which by the way, after last week where I was like, oh, I want to play some more first-person shooters and stuff.
I'm probably getting more recommendations for Team Fortress 2 than anything else, just so you guys know.
So I probably will have to check that out at some point.
But anyway, Team Fortress 2 is one of the games that you can make movies with now with the Valve Source Filmmaker.
I guess one of the videos they were showing off was this Meet the Pyro video.
I haven't watched this myself yet.
Yeah, it's a brand new one.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Garry's Mod Garry's Mod
So, anyhow, you can sign up for the filmmaker beta at www.sourcefilmmaker.com And I guess right now it's only really Team Fortress 2, but I'm assuming there will be other games later.
And plenty of fake Half-Life 3 trailers to hit the web soon.
Now, if you're more of a Portal fan, Jamie, maybe this is something that will interest you.
A Portal turret mini-replica.
Don't you want a turret in your house, DarkSakura?
You can get a blow-up turret.
Well, this is not a blow-up.
It is an actual mini-model of the Aperture Sentry turret.
It's a 16-inch tall.
This company, Gaming Heads, is only making 350 of them.
You can pre-order it right now for release in quarter four of 2012 for the low, low price of $330.
Excuse me, $325.
Full-size.
Yes.
Not 60 inches.
I would just make one.
I've made one in Maya.
I've rendered one in 3D.
So, yeah, I don't know if it will actually shoot guns, but apparently it does have a sound module that plays the activation search, auto search, disabled, and all those sounds.
Just trying to get to that baby.
Your funeral.
And lastly, some people are very excited about this MMO.
It's Guild Wars 2.
And I gotta admit, I'm pretty curious.
I want to check it out.
The launch date has been announced.
Get ready to lose sleep the night of Tuesday, August 28th.
That is the day that Guild Wars 2 is launching.
The next and final beta weekend event is planned for July 20th through 22nd if you want another little sneak peek.
Although I do believe you have to have pre-ordered the game to be in the beta, but you never know.
You might have a friend or something that can show the game to you.
Tuesday, August 28th is the day that that launches.
Moving on, DarkSakra.
Well, you know how there was that whole thing that was Kusu that got the Minecraft Lego set made?
There's Portal 1 now.
It's got GLaDOS's chamber, the modular testing chamber with turrets, cubes, portal gun, and more.
So you can go to lego.kusuo.com I don't want to say Kuso because that's Japanese for shit.
slash idea slash view slash 18258 pound as in the pound symbol.
Then Gunlord for Dreamcast.
Yes, there's still Dreamcast games being made and you can get it for 40 bucks or you get a limited edition for 50 bucks.
It has a dragon box for 120 bucks.
So yeah, yeah, Dreamcast.
I love the Dreamcast shit.
and then finally Sony says that their new racing wheel is going to have double the accuracy of a DualShock and it's kind of a weird spaceship shaped freaky ass controller thing that uses the move and that's how they're marketing it it's gonna be 40 bucks seriously this thing is fucking weird it uses the move as well so if you don't have a move you gotta get one of those too
Don't have him move your SOL.
Just don't buy it.
I mean, seriously, just don't buy the steering wheel thing.
Let's be honest, how many more racing games that are going to utilize that are going to come out on the PS3 before the next system comes out?
Probably like one or two.
I'm linking this ugly-ass thing in the chat room, and Ranma, if you'll please put this on our Tumblr, it's just completely hideous.
It looks actually kind of like a really weird sex toy.
Which the move looks like anyway.
Let's get into the Fugle Question of the Week.
Every week we ask you guys a question on Facebook and the same question on Google+.
Put them together and you get Fugle.
That's why we call it the Fugle Question of the Week.
And because I can't let this topic go...
The question of the week this week was very simple.
And the question is, what is a gamer?
Actdeft says...
I'm an angel, but I'm a demon
Pretty in line with what we were saying earlier.
Flaco Jones replied and said, Anyone who games and is willing to identify themselves as a gamer.
I like that little kind of second twist there.
Willing to identify themselves as a gamer.
Maybe some folks on Facebook don't want to be gamers.
They just want to play their Price is Right slots.
Surtur says, A gamer is someone that includes video games, phone, handheld PC, and or console as part of their entertainment consumption.
So does that mean someone who budgets money for games?
Look at my house, gamer.
Alright, going to Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Ragenator says, A miserable sack of lies.
Oh, there it is.
Another Castlevania joke.
Oh wait, never mind.
That's the answer to what is a man.
Well, actually it's a miserable little pile of secrets.
But anyway...
Well, in simplest terms, a gamer is one who plays games, regardless of the form they take.
Video games, CCGs, tabletop, pen and paper RPGs, etc.
Usually, and more often than not, those that play video games pretty much come to mind first and foremost.
You know, Ragenator reminded me of the Twitter rant I wrote on that whole conversation the first time it came up.
And I said something about...
This guy has probably never played Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition Come back when you've calculated a THACO, bitch
RedTheHaze says, It's a person who enjoys video games as a hobby.
I won't distinguish between who's hardcore or not since that's a very hipster douche sort of thing that was being done before it was cool.
It's video games, it's for fun, and we should all get along.
I like his answer.
It's very hippie and non-hippie at the same time.
Get along or I will fucking kill you.
Kinda.
I'm embellishing.
Picaruno says, I'd argue that there's no such thing as a gamer.
It's as redundant a term as breather or eater since everyone plays some form of game whether you're aware of it or not.
Unless you're supremely boring.
Unless you play first person shooters, no offense.
I think he's being funny, not serious.
Well, there's mouth breather, but, you know, that's something different.
Porkchop says, obviously, a gamer is someone who plays games, but to go all Mr. Miyagi, a gamer has the ability to disconnect from reality, to travel to other worlds, whether it be to solve puzzles, explore uncharted lands, or battle formidable foes, a gamer can become one with their environment and achieve greatness through hard work and dedication among their peers, or something like that.
Somehow, I just, like, thought at the end of that statement there, it should be, and enjoy a book at your local library.
You know, it's like, something like that.
It was a very zen answer.
It was, it was very, like, then you see the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland taking a big poof off the hookah.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I just thought that was... Like, why even have... Why would there need to be stock... I need... I need a picture of a nerdy girl sitting awkwardly on a couch while her friend smokes a hookah.
I need this now as stock footage.
They're high on life, Loki.
I just don't know why you'd need that.
Lastly, TigerClaw says, a gamer is a person who plays not just video games, but all sorts of games, be it board games, the pen and paper, role-playing games, or card games.
And lastly, Chiggers says, here's the real short answer, one who games.
I think we can all accept that answer thank you everybody for listening or thank you everybody for well thanks for listening sure but thanks for responding as well contributing on Facebook and plus participating is the big word we use at VOG Network yes participating but contributing too stop giving me the death stare why are you giving me the death stare I'm not giving you the death stare you are giving me a little bit of death stare no no no no no hey Jamie Jamie Jamie what Garris
Well, that's like a new thing.
The first 10 years were Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, what?
The second 10 years will be Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.
Garris.
Teehee.
Loki.
So, apparently Hollywood's next big idea to bring to theaters, since they're adapting all sorts of properties, be it board game and movie title or comic book or, you know...
I don't know, all these reboots and stuff.
Now they're going to bring back Carmen Sandiego.
As in, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?
You're journeying into geography.
You know a story like this is just begging for it.
It is.
It's just begging for it.
It is.
It's begging for it.
One, two, three.
And really any movie needs...
I don't want to hear the dubstep version of this though.
No, nothing beats dubstep.
That would be kind of funny.
We need to have a serious moment.
This is a for real serious moment.
I don't care if you have to blow all five of these men to get this to happen.
This movie is null and void if that song is not in it.
Can we all agree on that?
Play it in the credits.
Credits is fine.
It doesn't have to be the first or second song in the credits.
It's like the last song in the credits or second to last.
Have Carmen Sandiego be in New York City and these guys standing on the street do...
There's a hilarious cameo they could do.
She shows up in Disneyland and it's the Dapper Dance.
Fine.
I don't care how you do it, and I don't care if these guys have aged 20 years.
Get a new Rockapella.
If they can keep doing Minuto over and over, then they can do new Rockapella.
I agree with SSJ100, Matt.
Rockapella needs to be on standby at all times.
Here's the weird thing, though, about it, though, is it sounds like this is going to be based on... Granted, it's been a very long time since I played the PC game.
I don't remember if you were also a...
I think, weren't you part of the ACME agency or something like that?
Yes.
Because she was part of the ACME agency and then she turned to the life of crime or something like that.
She went rogue.
She went rogue.
Was there really a fucking backstory to Carmen Sandiego?
Yes, there apparently was.
I thought it was just like, we gotta capture this bitch.
The old version of the game, it's like, why are we looking for her?
She's bad.
Get her.
It was the whole story.
There was a cartoon series.
The cartoon series wasn't bad, I thought.
I played the crap out of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.
But anyways, the story, it's being penned by Darren Lemke, who did Shrek Forever After, and Jack the Giant Killer, I guess that's coming out soon.
Sounds great.
And then, of course, the movie involves Carmen Sandiego, who's turned from the greatest detective to an infamous criminal, and then her former colleagues try to hunt her down, and she...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and Angelina Jolie would go topless.
There's nothing wrong with a little gratuitous nudity.
I do believe that they're trying to make it a family.
She's naked under that red trench coat.
In my head, she always was naked under that red trench coat.
I believe that they're trying to make it a little family friendly, but I would be down for the topless uncut edition.
Uncut edition, exactly.
Unrated.
Family Friendly or Full On Big Breasted Nudity Sounds wonderful to me I look forward to the success of this movie and hopefully the Oregon Trail movie and Number Munchers the movie Hollywood is really out of ideas I think that's what we've come down to is that they're out of ideas
You know what's sad, though?
There was one essential character in the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego TV show.
Oh, you're not going to be able to hear this.
It's very quiet on this movie here, but it's the Chief.
You can hear that in the background.
Remember the Chief?
She was great.
She was great, and she was a character in the video games that they had and everything, but unfortunately that actress, Lynn Thigpen, she passed away a couple years ago, so unfortunately they would have to put somebody new in her role.
or somebody old in her role.
Perhaps somebody from the SimCity series that could maybe do some news reporting or something like that.
Yeah, but that wasn't a sassy black woman.
I don't care.
It's still alright.
It could be Samuel L. Jackson, a sassy black man.
Although, since race isn't an issue, if you want to talk about somebody old, Betty White would make a great chief.
Oh, I don't care.
Just run her over with a truck.
Just get the one chick from the community.
She's a sassy black woman that could play the role.
I think it'd work.
Or what's her name from Reno 911?
Maybe.
Wanda Sykes because, God, she can't be in more annoying roles out there.
Wanda Sykes is the chief.
Oh man, we probably should have done the listless tonight.
Sassy black woman you would have liked to have had as the chief, but unfortunately we have a different topic tonight.
That's a little specific.
Old edutainment game that needs to become a movie.
Kathy Griffin, because she identifies as a strong black woman.
Turtle, the movie.
Vandy has a great one, Medea as the chief.
All right, and since you all brought it up, the one actress who could be the new chief from Sin City Action News.
Carol Davenport here with a special report.
Tornado!
Sin City!
Big Wings!
Cars!
Trailer!
Sin City Animal Park!
Gone!
Forget it!
We're partly my hands!
We went to the Sin City Animal Park yesterday!
She literally disappeared off the face of the earth.
She is such a great actress.
I mean, you know somebody was just standing there off camera with a tornado blowing it in her face, and she was doing all that acting for the tornado.
It was just bravo.
Bravo, Carol Davenport.
Bravo.
And you know, back when I was kind of toying with the idea of FMV actors, where are they now?
She is not easy to find.
She isn't.
I tried to find her, too.
That's the interview I want more than any other.
Find me.
Find her and bring her to me.
SSJ100 Matt says he's still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo.
And Tiger Call recommended Zoe Saldana for Carmen Sandiego and that woman needs to eat some tacos.
I like her though.
She needs to eat something.
I love her in Star Trek.
She still needs to eat.
Uhura had some back, sorry.
We're going to go topless in Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
I'd even be fine with Mila Kunis doing the role.
I would pay to see that.
She is a gamer, isn't she?
She would be familiar with the subject material.
They've done fake topless with her, but it's time.
It's time in your career to elevate it to the next plateau.
Let's go.
If Halle Berry could go topless and win an Oscar, just saying.
How would you work a topless scene into Carameldansen?
I would even be fine with Halle Berry doing topless chief, you know?
She could be a sassy black woman.
For me, see, Halle Berry's not very sassy to me.
I always picture Monsters Ball, but I don't know.
And then Storm.
But anyway.
Okay.
No, Natalie Portman would not make Carmen Sandiego, sorry.
Here's how you work a topless scene into the Carmen Sandiego movie, is that she's hiding out in Monaco at the beach.
Because I think that was a scene in, what was that movie with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo that was basically James Bond, but it wasn't?
It was, um...
I'm not James Bond
She's just... I mean, come on, if Holly Berry's taking it off in Swordfish... Swordfish!
I mean, a movie that really didn't need that.
But she did it.
Thank you, Acidic Vampire, The Thomas Crown Affair.
That was it.
Uh... Remember?
All right.
Anyhow, what are you snickering at over there, DarkSakura?
Oh, one of my friends posted one of those demotivational posters of two midgets getting into a fight and says, I have a feeling this is going to be a short fight.
Oh, stop.
All right.
Thanks for watching!
40 years ago was when Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney got together and founded Atari.
At the time, it was Sigi.
I guess that's what they wanted to call it, but they couldn't get that name, so they went with Atari.
Great runner-up.
So yeah, that's awesome.
40 year anniversary for Atari.
And yeah, they did a little infographic.
1972 is when it was founded.
That's when Pong came out.
Breakout was 76.
The original Atari 2600 or the Atari VCS, 1977.
Let's see.
Of course, they don't mention the big video game crash in here.
Oh no, they do.
1983.
Revenues dropped 97%.
Later on, the Atari greatest hits on the iPad, which, by the way, on the 40th anniversary, they just made all the games free.
So I actually played, I didn't talk about it in my gaming week, because, like, LOL, Atari 2600, but I played, like, Combat 2.
I played Sword Quest, which was an amazing... There was a Combat 2?
It was a prototype that was never actually released, and it's in that iPad 1.
Is it any good?
No.
No.
Well, on the iPad, no.
But if it had come out many years ago, yes.
Because the terrain is different.
There's trees, which is different colored blocks that you can shoot through.
And it kind of has a more natural look.
Kind of like River Raid, but combat.
If that makes any sense at all.
Yes, Atari is 40 years old.
And I thought, you know, to celebrate Atari's birthday, maybe we could throw them a listless party!
That's right, we're going to play Listless, which we haven't done in a few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.
So let me explain how Listless works with you guys.
We are going to be coming up with the definitive list, and it's a highly scientific process we go through.
First, let me give you the topic.
Tonight's topic is... What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?
because let's be real, Atari slipped a little bit over the years.
Did any of you play Driver 3?
Did anybody actually own a Jaguar besides DarkSakura?
No, I haven't owned a Jaguar.
Really?
Because the only two games that were good on it, I actually owned on Sega Saturn.
So anyhow, we want to do a topic, what could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?
What we're going to do, each of us will go around here in studio, myself, Loki, DarkSakura, and special guest Alan tonight, and we're going to give our top three answers.
That's going to leave us with a list of 12.
And then the hard part, it's not fun, but science isn't easy, you guys.
It's not easy.
So we're going to have to go around and each person will take one item off the list.
That leaves us with a list of eight that those of you in our chat room live at live.vognetwork.com can vote on to make the definitive list.
Now, if you guys have suggestions, yell them out in our chat room because if one of our hosts decides they suddenly don't like one of the answers they wrote down before the show...
or one of the answers gets duplicated or they simply like your answer better then they will use it and hopefully give you credit unless they just happen to have wrote the same thing down already because I see one of my answers already got written down in chat so we'll see what happens oops it would help if I didn't leave the chat room all right I'm an idiot okay
Let's start the list.
Of course, I can't start the list until I open up WordPad.
There we go.
All right, let's start off the list.
Alan, you're the guest tonight, so you'll start us off.
Alan, your number three option.
How could Atari be relevant today like it was 1982?
Combat as a Facebook game with real money microtransactions to rotate more than once a day.
DarkSakura, we'll let ladies go next.
Your number three answer.
Atari Presents Pizza Time Theater The Game I see.
Wasn't Chuck E. Cheese at one time Pizza Time Theater?
No, additional.
I see.
So what would happen in Pizza Time Theater The Game?
You'd vomit.
And you'd have to shoot the animatronics with a pizza gun.
Did the animatronics go bad at night?
And then you'd have to run away from the employees and hide in the pole position machine so they don't kick you out.
Alright.
Let's see.
Stupid helicopter.
I'll go next.
I'll let Loki go last.
My answer for the thing that they could do, Garrus 2600.
This is my answer.
It would just be a brand new Atari 2600 game that is Garrus' face.
And that's all it can mouth things to.
And then that horrible, horrible 2600 chip.
So Garrus 2600.
All right, Loki, your number three answer for how could Atari be relevant today?
Marvel Madness 2.
Oh, a serious answer from Loki.
That's a good one.
That's a damn good answer.
Give me a new Marvel Madness game.
That's awesome.
Well, true, we did get Super Monkey Ball, but that's not quite... Not even close.
Marvel Madness 2.
All right.
So, so far we have Combat on Facebook, Pizza Time, Theater of the Game, Garrus 2600, and Marble Madness 2.
Let's go to the number two answers.
Alan?
Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition for Steam, XBLA, and iOS
And how would Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition work?
Just meows and he'd bounce around in his little suit.
Instead of going boop, boop, it goes meow, meow.
No, it would be meow, meow, meow.
And the little Pong thing would leave rainbow trails.
Perfect, right?
President Cat.
All right.
Loki, or excuse me, DarkSakura, your number two answer.
working 5200 controllers working 5200 controllers if anyone has ever owned one or more Atari 5200 you know the controllers are shit and even aftermarket controllers are kind of shit if they just had real 5200 controllers that you didn't have to hold a screwdriver to the contact to get it to hit start on your damn game
Then maybe the 5200 might have lived longer.
Maybe it might have caught on.
Because it has the best home version of Kix ever.
Can you tell that this is a sore point?
Maybe a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Alright, my answer is kind of similar to what we already heard, but it's what I wrote down.
I'm running with it.
I said remake E.T.
as a PlayStation Network Xbox Live Arcade game.
I had E.T.
the extraterrestrial 30 year anniversary HD remake pre-order bonus via GameStop exclusives.
I was gonna say remake Yars Revenge, and then I was like, oh, wait, they actually did that.
And, well, yeah, we're sitting here now.
So, uh, I say E.T.
It was just misunderstood.
If they would just have made it a little more difficult to fall in those fucking holes, it would have been so bad.
I played the hell out of that game, and I was seven, and children are stupid.
laughter
E.T.
was not that bad.
There were far worse games on the 2600.
Pac-Man being one of them.
Excuse me.
That game was shit.
Alright, at least E.T.
had that cool neck thing.
Alright, Loki, your number two answer.
My number two answer would be a sequel to Adventure in the Style of Skyrim.
Could that be awesome?
Yeah, it's like Atari has the most generic fucking name for an RPG ever.
They own that trademark.
Unless they sold it years ago, which is possible.
But they could make a sequel to Adventure.
Because remember, there was Adventure.
That's true.
Wasn't there a prototype for Adventure 2?
I want to say I've heard of one somewhere.
I think maybe.
I think there was.
No.
But what they need is they need Adventure with blood.
Like, when you kill those dragons, I want to feel it.
I want that shit that's in the Dawnguard expansion where swords go through heads and all that stuff and all that crazy, violent stuff from Skyrim.
Adventure with Violence.
Okay, number one answer time.
Adventure 2 was on the 5200 and it was a proto.
So I'm not crazy, but it was 5200, which far less people own than the 2600.
I've got two of them.
Give me one.
All right.
Alan, your number one answer for How Could Atari Be Relevant Like It Was 1982.
It was originally going to be the ET1, but that's yours now.
So I'm going to say finish what Custer's Revenge started and find a way to break into the adult entertainment industry.
You know, I think there's a hint of realness to that answer because it's like the one place that no one else would dare to go.
But Atari could have a future in pornography, except maybe it could be less racist next time.
That should have been my number three answer because it's more silly, but I was pressed for an idea.
Let's understand.
Did you get that one from Chad or did you make that up?
I made it up.
Oh, good times.
Good job.
All right.
DarkSakura, your number one pick.
You know this one because I said it before we even started this.
A new console, the Atari 1090.
Why 1090?
I don't know.
It sounds good.
We had the 7800 and I was going to do the 1080, but I don't know.
You've got 10 extra points of definition.
It's 1090 points of awesome Atari 1090.
So all those blocks will be super sharp and not too pixely.
All right.
My number one answer for how could Atari be relevant like it was in 1982.
More Tempest 2000.
Yes.
Yes, I agree with that, Rob.
More Tempest 2000.
And you know what?
You should recharge my Super Zapper.
Yeah, they did Tempest 3000.
Yes, I do.
That was supposed to be on the Jaguar.
I played it at Atari Party two years ago.
Nice.
Freaking awesome.
But we need more Tempest 2000.
Heck yeah.
I don't...
It wasn't on 2600, it was on the Jaguar.
And the Sega Saturn.
And then Tempest X was the PlayStation version.
And it had the most awesome soundtrack that ever awesomed.
I'll play you a clip later.
I'll play you a clip later.
Alright, but first we have to get the last answer.
Loki's number one answer.
Loki?
A combat MMO done in the style of 2600, but since they've got planes and tanks and stuff like that, imagine armies of tanks and planes and stuff like that fighting each other.
Kind of like the big open warfare that they have in Battlefield 3 or something like that, but with really 4-bit tanks.
I love it.
I love it.
Combat the MMO.
Sure.
I had to shorten it, sorry.
Alright, so let's recap the list before we get to the eliminations.
Combat as a Facebook game to rotate more than once a day.
I don't know why I wrote it that way, but that's what it says.
Pizza Time Theater the Game, Garrus 2600, Marvel Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, a working 5200 controller,
Remake ET is the PSN XBLA game, sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming, a new console, the Atari 1090, more Tempest 2000, or Combat the MMO.
This is a tricky one.
These are all really good answers.
I don't know if I'm going to be able to eliminate one, but it's got to happen.
It's part of the process.
So, Alan, we start with you.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
Oh, boy.
Come on, let's see.
See if I can do this without chat wanting to kill me.
I'm going to say...
Pizza Time Theater, The Game, because I don't know what that is.
Oh, it's Chuck E. Cheese.
Chuck E. Cheese and Chewbacca Pizza.
Okay.
But it is removed from the list.
It's a hard one.
Well, DarkSakura, you can get revenge right here and take one of his off, but maybe you'll find one you want more.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
Actually, Rob, I'm going to say Garrus 2600.
What?
Because I don't want anything to mar my Mass Effect prettiness.
by pixelating it.
Sorry.
I like my high-res Garrus.
Fine.
Garrus 2600 is stricken from the list.
I am going to remove... I'm going to remove... I'm sorry, Alan.
Don't withhold, but I'm going to remove Combat as a Facebook game because we kind of have two answers involving Combat and I think Atari is kind of already on Facebook and they suck, so that's not going to save them.
It is stricken from the list.
Sorry.
Alan!
Oh, he already removed.
Never mind.
Loki, your turn then.
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
The Atari 1090, because I don't know what the hell that is.
You don't understand where the extra 10 is.
I don't know.
All I see is it's a lot less powerful than the 2600.
All right.
That could be bad.
It's just like, okay.
I have an extra zero.
Sorry.
This half of the screen is black.
This half of the screen is white.
Oh, wait.
They switched.
Something's happening.
All right.
It is stricken from the list.
So here we go.
This is what I'm going to post into chat.
You're going to send a private message to Sky in chat if you're listening live.
Type slash MSG space SKIE space your number one and number two answers.
We will tally them up.
Here we go.
Marvel Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, Working 5200 Controllers, Remake ET is a PSNX BLA game, Sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, Finish What Custer's Revenge Started and Break into Adult Gaming, More Tempest 2000, or Combat the MMO.
There it is.
We're going to tally up your votes and we will read the answers a little later in the show.
First, let me read some of the answers that the chatters came up with here.
Frisbee says, bring back those Sword Quest games with the contest they had in them.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
so let's see moving on let's see TigerClaw says remake Pac-Man 2600 with better graphics well that would be Pac-Man Legend of Zaku says ET remake with new super secret level where ET and Elliot recover the surplus codes or surplus copies from the New Mexico landfill where they lie today that's a good answer better yet the cartridges come back as zombies yeah
They rise from the grave.
Rise from your grave.
E.T., kill.
Hey, here's a bit of trivia for you.
What?
E.T.
's design was based off of a hairless, airless cat.
Really?
Yes, really.
I remember back in the day watching an HBO special with my mother and they showed how the sketches of a cat and then it was naked and everything.
Well, it does explain how he had so much control over Elliot then.
DarkSakura, I think we left off with one of your stories.
He did?
I forgot.
Yeah.
How about something about you, Suzuki?
Okay, sure.
He's announced a smartphone game called Gan Gan Pirates.
Yay!
It's a pirate-themed arcade-style shoot-em-up that is also competitive and cooperative multiplayer.
And it will be free-to-play.
It launches in Japan for iOS and Android in September.
And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and get it over here, too.
But nothing quite yet.
Who knows?
Gone Gone Pirates!
Is this a game you'd want to play?
If it's Yu Suzuki, heck yeah.
You know, I have a photo of him and my husband.
Yes, you have that up on your wall very proudly.
Yes.
Good times.
Loki?
So, EA's come out making bold claims and... I don't know.
They keep coming out.
Listen, if you're a company that's kind of the number two company right now as far as digital distribution goes, stop dogging on number one because going out there and saying, hey, we're going to be better than Steam.
We're going to do things Steam doesn't do, like not put things on sale.
How do you like that shit?
I mean, it...
Come out sounding stupid.
We're going to take everything that makes Steam successful and not do it, and we're going to kick their ass.
Fourth of July sale on Steam this week.
Just saying.
Let's pray.
Prayer circle.
Did it really start?
I know it hasn't started yet.
Let's form a prayer circle, everybody.
for a kick-ass Steam sale.
Actually, maybe that shouldn't happen because I'll end up spending $100.
I thought the pressure goal was going to be that they don't have a kick-ass sale so that we don't waste all of our money on it.
Yeah, that's true.
But anyways, so yeah, they basically said they want to be the Facebook of digital distribution compared to Valve's MySpace.
First off... That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, it is the stupidest thing ever.
They're basically...
It's not gonna fucking happen, okay?
You're gonna talk all this shit, but no one is gonna fucking go to Origin over Steam.
I mean, granted, you're saying, oh, hey, look, you know, look at how well Origin's doing because all these people are signed up on it.
Yeah, because all your fucking EA games require it.
Even the ones that aren't even on PC.
You have to have a fucking Origin login.
Yeah.
So, yeah, you have a lot more users or people that are signed up.
Doesn't mean they're fucking buying things.
Well, to be fair, Valve did the same shit, and we all let it slip off.
Yes, but how many games does Valve release versus how many games EA releases?
Valve games are like once in a decade.
I don't know.
It's a fucking event.
Yes, exactly.
Because when Valve did it with Half-Life 2, no one knew what the fuck Steam was, and people were pissed about it.
But we've all forgiven them because they're Valve.
and Steam of course took a couple years to become fucking awesome so Origin is still a turd.
Yeah, but it's the turd that I'm hoping puts Mass Effect 3 on sale Tuesday.
Okay, so let me quote what they said here.
EA is really in an interesting place.
We have this bar that is set so high so that whether it is any of our games or services, we want to be 90-plus Metacritic at everything.
Origin is moving in that direction.
We are not there yet.
We understand that, but we're going to get there soon.
Thank you for watching!
MySpace is getting into that I love the 90s type of thing.
Or better yet, I love the 70s or something where it's like, oh, remember when everybody had a pet rock?
I'm not exactly going to go out and buy a pet rock, but I look back on it with fond memories.
Remember when people used to post blingies on your profile and they were funny?
That's MySpace.
That was never attractive, Rob.
That was never attractive.
It was always hilarious.
But like, you know, seriously, just... I just... What are they gonna start doing on Origin?
Are they gonna start, you know, adding these at Origin.com, you know, email addresses and stuff like that without telling you and making those public, you know, so people can message you without, you know, you knowing them?
Are they gonna start, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
So maybe you should consider not comparing yourself to that.
And then also not comparing yourself to the top provider of anything until you become the top provider of that.
Just saying.
Just saying.
I mean, obviously, yes, we aim to be better than our competition.
Cool, but don't talk so much shit until you have something to back it up with.
All right.
Before we get into the listless results and the mailbag tonight, let's get into one more story here about Blizzard because they make some pretty popular PC games.
I don't know if you've ever heard of Diablo, but that is kind of a big deal or World of Warcraft.
Blizzard has told us about what games will be coming to Gamescom 2012.
Mists of Pandaria will have its opening cinematic debuted and there will be a hands-on demo there.
Also multiplayer for Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm.
Also Diablo 3 will still be there in full display and all that but they're not really announcing anything with Diablo 3.
The other thing I want to say is that Gamescom 2012 is August 16th through 19th.
A lot of people theorizing that Mists of Pandaria's release date clearly will not be before that, but probably won't be long after that.
Because if they were debuting the cinematic then, well shit, the game's not out obviously before that.
So a lot of people are theorizing at this point late September 15th.
for the Mists of Pandaria expansion.
So it wasn't a full year of having to raid Dragon's Soul, but pretty fucking close.
Just saying.
Anyhow, let's open the mailbag.
Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives in the mailbag head first, pick a few of her favorite emails, and reads them for you live on air.
Eh.
Okay.
First email.
Garris.
That's actually what it says.
Howdy!
First of all, a belated congratulations on your 10 year anniversary.
It's not late.
Congratulations.
One year I got a card for my birthday, which is in August, when I visited my grandparents for Christmas.
That is late.
Anyway, like many lemmings, I've been following the news of Microsoft's Surface announcement.
At first, I didn't think much of this announcement.
Then it dawned on me.
If pulled off correctly, Microsoft Surface can do what tablets, netbooks, and the iPad have been able to do.
Bring PC titles to the portable market.
Now, I'm not talking about the latest and greatest titles, but games from several years ago that people can still appreciate.
Hell, if they could get a good version of The Sims or WoW working on the thing, Microsoft Surface can take off.
Stay Black, Red Entertainment, Garris.
Sent from my iPad.
So clearly he's interested in the Surface if he sent it from his iPad.
Unless that was a joke, I don't know.
The Surface, the press conference was a little bit of a letdown.
I think we were expecting something bigger.
For me, I have one of the new iPads now, so I'm not really interested in a tablet for another three years at least.
They do some interesting things with it, that's for sure.
And I mean, if I was going to buy a tablet, I would probably get one of those, but...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So the next email comes from rdgsingh.
So small news for those into Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.
A recent fan-made patch was released that removes a set of in-game rules called laws allowing the player to play in more inventive ways.
And you can find an article on that on romhacking.net.
Okay, cool.
Next email.
Hey, OLR, this is Blade 3, a.k.a.
The Honey Badger.
What, because you don't give a fuck?
I just wanted to say congratulations on your 10th anniversary and so sorry I cannot participate live.
Also, I was chatting through Steam with Nick Crafter from Video Game Show, another show syndicated by All Games.
Um, um,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
are the hosts of this show, Bobby Blackwolf Show, and sometimes hosts of other shows depending on the network already, depending on what the topic is.
But if you really want to talk to somebody in charge, you need to talk to one of us or Bobby.
So just putting that out there because I don't
Ever, ever, ever want somebody to promise something on behalf of VOG we can't deliver on.
Just to make that very clear.
I'm not saying no in this case, but I can say we are looking for more stuff than just video games.
Although I am familiar with this show, and it's a pretty kick-ass show, and I'd be happy to work with them in some capacity.
But we'd definitely like more shows on comic books,
P.S.
I have been listening since 2004 when I got my first iPod, the iPod Mini.
I have grown up on your show as I was only 10 years old when I began listening and I am now 18.
Thanks for everything.
I cannot tell you what it would be like without your show.
DarkSakura.com
few websites have mentioned a Sega rep state of the game could be localized if there was an interest I tried to contact Sega's community folks but got no response what do you think could be done to get Sega's attention on bringing Project Diva over here hit them on Twitter hit them on Facebook hit them through the forums get other people to do it too and why not make a stupid online petition I don't know
get enough people to say something to them start a Facebook community get out there and pick it with signs yeah Facebook is a pretty decent way to be visible in this day and age and that's not a bad idea because that also gives them numbers which they can then take back to management and say look 15,000 people want this game and that'll help so anyhow
Next email?
Next email is from... No, not next email.
There's more to this email.
There were more questions.
Rob, jumping to conclusions.
For shame, for shame.
What is everyone's thoughts on Microsoft Surface?
I have no thoughts on this.
Oh, didn't we just talk about that a little bit?
We did.
So we can defer to the prior conversation.
Okay, Sky.
Uh-oh.
Since you express interest in first-party shooters, do give Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 a try on PC.
Each of Team Fortress 2's nine classes have play styles that don't always rely on having pinpoint accuracy.
On the other hand, Left 4 Dead 2 should help you improve your aim a bit.
I have played a little bit of Left 4 Dead 1 and it was fun.
Alan and I played that a little bit.
Right, Alan?
And we had some good times with that.
Left 4 Dead.
I was really, really bad at it.
It was kind of fun.
Have a good evening and may a visit to Pinkberry be in your futures.
And that comes from the nasty Canasta.
P.S.
Garris and Tali too.
And there are no more emails.
Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us another email for a future week.
Alright, let's do a few more stories.
Oh no, the FUs of the week.
We gotta get our angst out.
It's time to get ranty.
Why?
Because we can.
F you to Gluten for making me freaking sick all day yesterday to where I couldn't even leave the house.
I bet the pizza was so good.
Alan.
So once my new job starts and I'm fully trained and I'm actually allowed to do it by myself, it's like super late night shift depending on how shitty things are.
So won't be able to leave work until possibly 11 or midnight, which means I'm going to have to get a car at some point.
Someone's not going to pick my ass up all the time that late when they have a morning job.
So I guess FU to the reality that I might have to have a car and a license by the end of the year.
You should get a Vespa.
And yes, I know that I'm nearly 34 with no license and a car, and there's a very long history behind it.
Like, my family never had a car growing up, and I just thought that it's expensive and scary and shitty.
You know, I finally have to do it.
Well, like I told you before, my mom had a lot of the same thoughts you did, and she didn't end up getting a license until she was 37, and pretty much had to.
But she takes back roads everywhere, she just didn't have to touch the freeway.
Growing up in the East Bay and on the peninsula of San Francisco, the transit...
A joke compared to, like, New York, but it was good enough that I made it work.
Up here in Sacramento, transit sucks, so... Yeah.
Alright, Loki.
Uh, fuck you to the sudden bursting water pipe that we had at our house.
Thankfully we caught it right when it happened, so there wasn't any damage, but...
Still, the whole process is fucking annoying.
We have a giant dehumidifier, which is the size of a small fridge.
It sounds like a loud can opener.
I was reading about that on Nelly's Facebook.
Sorry that happened to you guys.
At least we were home.
She was about to leave.
I had to talk to some people that they were not home when that happened.
That was not fun.
Alright, let's see.
My FU of the week goes to the fact, this is easy, the fact that I was sick on my birthday.
That's right.
I don't know how, but I caught some type of sinus-y infection thingy.
You might hear it in my voice still, actually.
I sound a little different tonight.
I've been trying to kick this for about a week, which included on my birthday.
So thank you, Mother Nature, for that little present.
Really appreciate it.
Speaking of presents, just to let you know, I've got presents coming for both of you.
I have to finish making them.
Very cool.
But there are presents coming, and they are for you both.
Aw, yay.
The next OLR is going to be on my birthday.
Oh my god.
Oh shit, that means I can't do it, huh?
No, we don't have to do anything out for my birthday.
We'll figure something out.
We'll do it before or after.
But I'll have to bring it then.
You'll probably have to work anyway.
Oh wait, no, maybe not on the 8th.
Yeah.
Oh well, we'll figure something out.
Yeah.
We'll throw a party on air just for you.
Maybe you'll have to come right back next week.
Wicked says F you to being bad at Cataheroics.
And I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have been so mercenary in saying how could anyone die on Benedictus.
Because I have been in a fail party that died on Benedictus.
Not through anything I did.
Through everybody else sucking.
So...
Only the WoW players know what I'm talking about.
Just make sure you don't stand in stuff and dodge the waves.
Okay, I have an F you to add.
What?
To the add-on GTFO for being annoying.
You're standing in shit.
You need to tell it to GTFO.
I thought it would help, and it just was annoying.
Alright, let's get to the listless results.
You've all been dying to hear it.
What is the definitive answer, kids, to the list?
Thing that Atari 2600, or excuse me, Atari in general...
could do to be relevant like they were in the 2600 days?
How could a 40-year-old company be as relevant as they were in 1982?
Here it is, the top three answers, as mentioned, nominated by the hosts and voted on by chat.
Number three.
Number three answer is... Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.
Yay!
Y'all are pervs.
That's the number three answer.
The number two answer tonight... Marble Madness 2.
That's the game people want.
That's definitely a game people want.
And the number one answer... What do you most want...
A sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim.
That is what will save Atari's ass.
And I still say it could be a launch title for the Atari 1090.
I do.
So there it is.
Your top three answers.
Thanks for playing.
Here's a lifetime supply of turtle wax.
All right, let's move on.
And Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat.
The other thing they could do that would be kind of funny is like an arcade game that's basically an Atari 2600.
But you know how they have that giant Tetris machine with the controller that's really huge?
You do one even better.
My God, I played that at Golf Land like a week or two ago.
I think it was scary.
The Atari 2600 controller is really simple.
It's just a giant button and basically a giant joystick.
you have this giant foam joystick that you can kind of swing on or whatever and a giant button and so you play 2600 games on a giant screen with the giant controller it would be funny a giant 2600 that would be great actually hilarious
Alright, so we talked a little bit about the Wii U, and of course there's all different companies promising to bring various games to the platform.
One of which is actually, well, they do have a game coming to the Wii U at launch.
Their Ninja Gaiden 3 is getting a port, but...
Team Ninja is also thinking about Dead or Alive 5 for the Wii U and that makes sense because if you think about it they're doing Ninja Gaiden 3 there's already Tekken Tag Tournament 2 so it wouldn't be that difficult to port a game over I think from the Playstation 3 or 360 to the Wii U and they're saying right now we're doing our best to get ready for Playstation 3 and 360 for the version of Dead or Alive 5 but we want to hear what players think about
and, you know, the Wii U version or if they'd be interested in it.
So, I could see that happening, especially like with a Game of the Year edition or something like that.
They could do it.
That could be pretty awesome, actually.
You know, because it's a fun series and it's always hilarious in this day and age to see very adult games on a Nintendo platform.
I'd be curious what the tablet would be for.
How about Boob Cam?
Boob Cam.
Well, they do have photo mode.
Do they?
Yes, they do.
Nice.
And remember, not only do they have photo mode, but I believe this game had transparent clothing.
You could actually get water or something like that on different parts of the clothing, and it would be the correct transparency and stuff like that.
Or maybe it was ripping clothing.
Something to the effect of you see more boobies.
Do you think Team Ninja would feel burned at all over the reception over Metroid Other M?
Or do you think it's kind of like, eh, you know?
I think, if anything, they're going to be more burned at the fact that Ninja Gaiden 3 sucks and that, you know, it's going to be launched out for the Wii U and people won't give a shit.
Aw.
Sorry.
Unless they go back and fix the game, I don't think people are going to give a shit.
All right.
One more news story for you guys.
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to add us on Skype.
Do remember, we appreciate if you check Echo 1-2-3 first before using Skype.
Think outside the box.
You can also use Skype on a Vita.
You can use Skype on an iOS device or I'm pretty sure Android has it too.
Many ways you can install Skype and call the show or
Or you can just pick up a damn telephone.
If you still have one of those telephones on your wall with a rotary dial, it will work.
1-877-GAME-OLR You just will probably have to dial a lot.
So get your finger ready.
But first, one more story, and this has to do with Retro City Rampage.
Some folks looking forward to this game because it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.
God, when the hell is that coming out?
If it was on the NES.
No answer, but what I can tell you, it's going to support cross-play on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
So meaning if you buy it on one platform, you get it on the other.
And you can play across the two.
Well, do you get it on the other or do you have to buy both and then you can play?
Nope.
You get one and you unlock the other.
So it's one game for both.
That's awesome.
One payment, both versions.
Hooray.
I know I will be getting it for the Vita.
As reported by IndieGames.com.
It's the pay once, cross play deal.
Uh, said by, uh, who is this guy?
Martin Turton, who's with Clever Beans, putting this game out.
Quote,
Basically, we want to price the game in a way that would attract us to buy it ourselves.
Very interesting tactic.
They're basically saying, you know what?
Yeah, we could double dip people, but if we don't and we make it free, it's going to attract more people to the game because it's like, hey, free game.
Well, I was originally going to get it on 360, although I might still buy it on PlayStation Network and 360 because...
It could be fun.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Start with Evita.
So that's pretty cool.
So good job on you, Retro City Rampage.
Some good news to end with tonight.
We're going to open up Skypline.
It's open.
If you want to call, do it now.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
I'm logging into Twitter right now.
Yeah, Rob, on your Twitter as I check my Facebook.
Let's go to some tweets while we wait for calls.
Again, Skype line is open.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Easy name on Skype.
Orange on radio.
YYR says, Ask Dark Tetsuya.
That's the person right below.
Sorry.
That's not me.
Ask Dark Sakura.
to give Fernando, the main character in Bungie Ferret Tossing, or BFD, a last name.
He's French-Canadian, and then get back to me.
Well shit, this could have been the listless tonight, but oops.
Fernando needs a last name.
He is French-Canadian.
Cocteau.
I was going to say an amalgamation of Celine Dion.
She's French-Canadian.
Fernando Celine Dion?
Fernando C. Dion.
All right, never mind.
That's stupid.
Yeah, that is.
Oh, poor Alan.
No, I mean, I was trying to think of a way to make it work like Ceci Dion.
You think about that, DarkSakura, while I take this call.
Poisson.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
No, I thought of it.
Poisson.
I'm taking a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, what's up?
This is John, a.k.a.
Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network.
What is up, John, a.k.a.
Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network?
Indie podcast, holla.
What's up, Robert?
What's up?
This is the first time I've actually been in the chat listening to the show live, but I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now.
Awesome!
Well, thank you for joining us live, and I'm happy we could pop your Skype cherry tonight.
Definitely.
I meant to come in last week, but, you know, wow.
Don't you say anything.
It was kind of a pain in the ass to get through last week, so it's a lot clearer tonight.
Definitely.
I just wanted to say hi to everybody there, and just kind of slightly promote Nerdgasm Network a little bit, but I do have a little bit of discussion.
It's not shameless self-promotion completely.
All right.
Okay, first discussion, then shameless self-promotion.
Gotcha.
Okay.
There were some talks with the Wii U earlier, and I mentioned this inside the chat, and I kind of want to get your guys' opinion on this, but it seems like Nintendo's not really kind of learning from their old mistakes, because the Wii kind of came out before the 360 and the PS3, I believe, and you can obviously tell by comparison that the Wii is not the strongest graphically of the three systems.
and sadly, it seems like the Wii U is going to come out again and while it's going to be superior to the 360 and the PS3 as far as graphics and check and everything, it's still going to vastly be inferior to, you know, whatever the Microsoft Sony platform is going to be.
I'm just wondering, do you think Nintendo...
Should have even, like, brought this out now?
Or do you think they probably should have waited a year and tried to equalize it?
I mean, do they understand that they're going to, you know, that they're essentially going to repeat the path?
Here's the thing, and, you know, in theory, what you're saying, it sounds good, and to me, as somebody who's been gaming for many, many years, it makes a lot of sense, and I always want the best technology and all that.
However, there's one big flaw, and that is the Wii sold fuck-tons.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The theory that you do have here is right, in that the technology will lose steam, and it will lose steam fast.
That's the problem, is that the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, they're continuing to sell, in some ways, Sony better than ever, but Nintendo...
Thanks for watching!
The Wii U with an extra tablet controller.
People are familiar with tablets.
I don't think they're going to give a shit that it's slightly better graphics and it has a tablet controller on it.
They're going to be like, why do I need this?
I can buy a Wii.
And honestly, they can.
They can buy a Wii and New Super Mario Bros.
and they have pretty much the same offering as New Super Mario Bros.
U and a Wii U. Except they don't have the extra tablet controller and the graphics are slightly prettier, I guess.
I guess at the end of the day it also comes down to how badly do soccer moms across America want a sequel to New Super Mario Bros.
Wii because it's about the most exciting original IP that Nintendo unveiled for that thing.
And it's not even that original, but it's a successful formula.
That's what this is all about.
And sadly, I think software might end up playing a big issue, especially, I mean, it's Nintendo, so obviously third-party software is going to be a big issue.
Especially because when they first originally announced the Wii U, one of the big titles they were toting was Batman Arkham City.
And the thing is, that's already been out for about a year, and the Wii U still isn't even out yet.
So are they still really going to be toting a two-year-old game?
Well, sadly if E3 is any indication, yes.
But it's got a cool new mechanism.
But I don't think that's necessarily a big game for them.
Because, I mean, yeah, it's cool that they have Batman Arkham City, but there's plenty of other games that are coming out around the same time, like Assassin's Creed 3, which will be pretty big.
And then they've got a lot of exclusives for the system as well.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
That's just... It seems like easy money.
Unless I can finally romance some of the characters I've been wanting to romance.
Like who?
It's my secret.
Chakwas.
I can see him doing a Game of the Year edition with Mass Effect, although that would be pretty quick.
She is a bit of a cougar, isn't she?
Exactly.
Self-promotion time, so we can wrap up and get more calls.
Self-promotion.
We like to support indie podcasts, so please plug away.
Alright, I got three podcasts I want to plug.
Obviously, my home at nerdgasmnetwork.com.
We got great discussions going on.
We got a video game podcast that I co-host with Ryan, Josh, Patrick, a few other people.
They also have a new movie podcast where it's kind of like a riff track where they watch a movie and they kind of discuss, like, they kind of poke fun at it, but they also kind of discuss, you know,
That's a great idea.
I've heard other people talking about that sort of thing.
I don't want to call it a Riff Trax podcast, but that's kind of what heavily inspires this sort of thing to play along with the movie.
I'm glad somebody is doing it and not just talking about it.
It's great.
Yeah, we're just having issues with the YouTube channel because that's where we're uploading the films plus the commentary and we're getting some issues with that.
But we're working on it.
But you know, there's nothing wrong with putting just the commentary out there and say, okay, press play in 3, 2, 1, go.
And you can watch the movie along, especially if it's titles available on Netflix.
Tons of people have Netflix.
It'd be super easy.
Yeah, that'd be something to work on.
Also, Nerdgasm Network is home to the bi-weekly Beercasm, where Ryan and some more select group review beer.
Well, my gosh, you don't just have a podcast, you have a whole freaking network over there, but that sounds, that's awesome.
Yeah, there's also a couple other shows coming down the pipeline.
We've got a music podcast, there's going to be a tech, kind of an overall tech podcast coming up as well.
But yeah, nerdgasmnetwork.com, that's...
Like you said, indie podcast all the way.
That's right.
And I got one more site I kind of want to pimp out.
I'm sure you know these guys.
Slykick and Spike, the host of GameBooey.org.
That's right.
It's a newer show, but it's a lot of fun.
I used to go to high school with Spike, so I'm really good friends with him.
Slykick used to be a guest on my old podcast, Geeks or Fans, but that
Don't.
But, yeah, no, Spike and Slykicker, too, very, very good friends of mine.
And I've been begging them to come up and be on OLR forever.
So, open invite, guys.
You want to come pimp your show, get your butt up here to Sacramento.
It's not China.
It's not that far of a foreign land.
Yeah, well, try getting them to even get the stock.
I've been trying to get them to come out here for, like, 12 years now.
Alright, we'll both keep pestering him and one of us will win eventually.
Definitely.
In fact, I actually started listening to Lawrence Vondredio because of Horde House because Slidekick actually promoted a couple episodes he was on on Horde House.
Indie podcast promotion, it works.
It works.
Yeah, definitely.
Those are the two podcast sites that you guys should check out.
GameBlue.org and, of course, NerdGazzaNetwork.com.
All right.
If I let you plug anymore, I'm going to have to make you pay for it.
All right.
Have a good one, buddy.
I've got to take more calls, but thank you for your call.
All right.
No problem.
And keep listening to OR.
All right.
Will do.
By the way, I have decided on a last name thanks to Alan.
Oh, okay.
Bye.
Take care.
Yes.
You have a last name.
Thanks to Alan.
Poutine.
Poutine.
So the name will be Fernando Poutine.
Fernando Poutine.
All right.
There it is.
That's the name.
Fernando Poutine.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
It's Shane.
Hey, Shane.
What's up?
Me.
I'm awake.
Is there anything you wanted to call to share with us tonight?
Yes.
I want to talk about Mass Effect.
Yay!
My favorite topic!
It's mine too!
What a coincidence.
You know, it's weird.
So, I'll get it out of the way.
First of all, I do like the extended cut stuff, despite a lot of people hating it.
And I understand their complaints, but I like all the happy and sad parts of it, so it's cool.
But I think...
either Bioware is really stupid and the fans are brilliant or Bioware is an evil genius because I'm finding even more people starting to subscribe to the indoctrination theory after the extended cut now.
And there's all these new things that they put in the extended cut that point to it.
And it's getting ridiculous.
And I don't, I'm torn because I used to believe in it.
I still kind of do.
don't want to keep going with it if you want something to be true bad enough you'll find a way to make it true in your mind you know yes but there's videos and sound files again that's all part of they're just wishing really hard wishing I want it to be true click my heels three times there's no place like indoctrination theory there's no place like something like that
I don't think they would ever really say that.
I did.
Okay, well, so it hasn't just been about Mass Effect this week, though, but you also have been playing Final Fantasy XI with me.
And for a change, I started playing the game first and peer pressured you into buying it.
So what did you think about the return to Final Fantasy XI?
It was a nice homecoming sort of feeling, and I like that everything's familiar, but at the same time they've changed it enough that it's still interesting.
So it's not just the same, let's go to the dunes and level for four hours, but only get 50% of the way through a level because we died seven times.
I still really need to play Skyrim, even though I've been hearing kind of tepid reception of the DLC I never did beat the freaking campaign mode in the first game, I need to go back and do that
That's right.
I started replaying that last night because I got really bored and it was still okay.
But I'm not going to download any DLC because it's an Elder Scrolls game and they're generally awful.
So I don't care.
It's hit and miss.
It's hit and miss.
All right.
Well, anything else you want to share with us tonight, Shane?
No, because I'm sure I'll just talk more about Mass Effect on Horde House.
Well, like I was bugging you last night, just put the pen to paper and write up something to post on vognetwork.com.
Actually, Shane, I have to ask you a question.
I have an answer, what's up?
What do you think of my idea for an MMO for Mass Effect?
I would drop all my games to play it, but I also don't know how it would work.
Like, especially with the current universe the way it is, I don't know what we would really base the MMO off of.
I have to finish the third one before I can decide, but I'm sort of thinking, you know, post-endgame.
And then you have to figure out which ending's canon, then.
Prequel!
Prequel, prequel, prequel!
You just don't do it in the same storyline.
Nobody wants a prequel because then if you do a prequel and if you set it too far back, then you'd be stuck on Earth, which would be boring.
Easy-ass prequel because with the whole horde alliance, two-faction type of thing, Turian War.
You set the MMO during Turian War.
No, that's terrible.
I disagree.
Only because you wouldn't be able to romance a Turian.
Shut up.
Unless you were a Turian.
Because it's true.
It might be the first time we see female Turians, so that might make it worth it alone.
They were apparently in the comic, and they look horrible, so no.
That's not what female Turians look like in my head.
Alright.
Before this turns into the Mass Effect show, I gotta let you go, Shane.
Shane, we should do that, a Mass Effect show.
He's already pitched one to me.
Yeah, I already have.
And I say, produce a pilot.
All right.
All right.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.
I did tweet YYR back.
Hopefully he got it.
Because you're confusing the poor guy.
Because you sent him something else first, I think.
Poutine.
It is poutine.
I stick with poutine.
All right.
The final answer.
because that's a good idea because it's kind of disgusting looking but delicious.
Like a ferret?
Ferrets aren't delicious.
I've never had ferrets.
Alright, we have another call coming in.
Let's take it.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Sorry, this is Techie Q. Say that again?
Sorry, this is Techie Q. Techie Q?
Techie Q. Techie Q. I gotcha.
Techie Q. What's on your mind, buddy?
Hi, welcome to the show.
Um...
Two things.
One, congratulations on your 10th year since I didn't get to call in last week.
The phone lines were absolutely bonkers last week, but we appreciate it.
We like the fact that our birthday can last across multiple weeks.
And also, I want to gloat on the classic game of the week.
I'm one of the few people that beat Ninja Gaiden without cheating.
Well, look at you!
Mad props, seriously.
I do want to shake your hand.
I'm giving you a virtual handshake right now.
He really did.
He held his hand up in front of the monitor.
I did.
I was looking for an emote icon that I could possibly send over, but that'll have to do.
There he is.
A thumbs up.
I just sent him.
I mean, seriously, it's really damn difficult to beat that game.
It is.
So anyone who has, hey, you get notice from me.
Especially like the last level, it's like an endurance run.
And isn't it just the biggest exercise in frustration?
For the first hour it is.
Back to three bosses you have to beat three times.
I'll put it this way.
Even beating Ghosts and Goblins isn't nearly as frustrating as Ninja Gaiden.
Let me ask you this question, Techie Q. Do you like the new Ninja Gaiden games?
Because clearly you're a fan of the old ones.
But do you think they got it right with the newer ones?
I don't like the third one.
It really dimmed it down.
Nobody does.
Let's be real.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, that's crazy.
I think it's the humor in the 80s satire that
People miss out if you don't play enough of the game.
Yeah.
I think you'd like it too, right?
Because it's got a lot of 80s satire, and they did a Commodore 64 segment.
I'm going to have to check that out.
And boobies, right?
I heard there's lots of... Is there lots of boobies?
If you get the right costume, you get a grand for it.
There you go.
All right.
Alright, well, take a cue, I gotta let you go, but Lollipop Chainsaw, check it out.
Let you know what I think in a future week.
Okay, take care.
Take care.
Alright, bye.
Alright, I'm gonna have to close up the Skype line just because we're running a little long, but I still gotta get last minute stories and tweets.
You know what I want?
What?
Poutine.
I've had it before.
It's really good.
It is really good.
It is really good.
If you ask really, really nicely, maybe Alan will get you a little spoon and there's some strawberry pinkberry in the freezer.
All right.
Don't give her too much because I want some later.
One spoonful.
No, I'm kidding.
All right.
Zeeba tweets us saying,
But based on the first episode of Tron Uprising that I saw, yeah, it was pretty good.
I enjoyed it.
I was going to give it a positive review.
It wasn't perfect.
I felt the storyline was a little bit cliche and predictable.
But, you know, it is a cartoon.
Let's not be too harsh on it.
And I liked the whole, like, dark style of it.
You know, it was a very Batman animated series look.
Because, you know, Batman was always a black canvas as opposed to a white canvas.
And I'm pretty sure Tron is done very similarly.
You really liked it too, right?
Yeah, I watched the first three episodes.
It was good.
I've liked it so far.
I still need to catch up on some of them that I missed.
Alright.
DarkTetsuya says he's going to make good on President Cat Pong.
Google Nexus 7 GameStop
That story's been making the rounds this week.
It actually doesn't surprise me too much because GameStop has been openly like, trade us your iPhone, trade us your iPad.
They want to get into that market and I think it's because they're trying, you know, as much as I am personally not a fan of GameStop, I can appreciate that they're trying to stay a step ahead and like, oh shit, if everything goes digital distribution, our market's going to be hardware.
You know, we're going to be fucked soon.
So they're trying to get their fingers in other pie's
So that they don't go completely out of business.
So you know what?
It makes sense.
Honestly, I think it's because they're trying to get more reasons for people to trade in their stuff.
And some people want to trade in games to buy tablets and stuff.
And so that way they can sell more used games.
Interesting.
Because there's no markup in hardware.
I'm not sure about consumer electronics, but I know for game hardware there's no markup.
What I said has to be some of it, right?
I mean, that they're trying to get into other stuff than just the games.
They're not worried about it because of who they are.
One other tweet from TigerClaw, and this will be the last tweet, and then we can go to last-minute stories.
I don't know even if you have any.
The shutdown law in South Korea.
We reported on this either last week or the week before.
Some folks are challenging it.
NCSoft being one of them, according to this news story from GamesIndustry.biz that TigerClaw sent me on Twitter.
South Korea's shutdown law has been called into question by citizens and game companies.
Two lawsuits have been filed against the law.
One is a Korean organization representing parents and children who says the law undermines parental rights to educate their children We need that organization here
Agreed.
The second lawsuit was filed by game publishers NCSoft, Neowiz, and Nexon and they just argued the law itself is illegal.
The lawsuits were filed last fall and the arguments are currently being heard etc.
etc.
So we'll get more news on that in the coming weeks.
There you go.
That's it for tweets.
How about last minute stories tonight, Loki?
The voice actor for Duke Nukem is bitching that some of the voice acting work in video games goes over to film actors.
And he says, film actors do not need voice acting roles in video games or commercial projects.
These roles are for voice actors, not Hollywood celebrities, and when you consider the amount of money they make for each and every film project, it's unfair for those of us who have struggled to make ends meet in our chosen profession.
I have trained and worked hard for nearly 30 years as a voice actor, and when film stars land a role in either game or commercial project, they earn far more than I do, even though I am a SAG Afro...
I really hate to say it, but I think this guy is just... I mean, the reality is he needs to ask the question, well, why do celebrities get in Shrek?
and why are they in the Disney movies and why are they you know because unfortunately star power and the names behind it mean a lot and as much it's it sucks because this guy does have an iconic voice in many ways the voice of Duke Nukem right hail to the king baby and all that stuff right nobody knows his name maybe that's what needs to change maybe there needs to be more recognition about who you are
and then you build that star power.
I think that's the problem.
It just made me think about something, though, back to Mass Effect, how you've got Martin Sheen as the elusive man and modeled on him and everything.
You've got all of these actors, you know, Seth Green in it, but the main characters, well, yeah, main characters there, but the main character is a well-noted voice actor.
I'm actually thinking of the female Shepard character.
who's done like fantastic roles was in the Avengers cartoon was in X-Men in all kinds of stuff and you've got the talents going in that one where they're best directed and I think that that's really the approach that should be taken that everyone should be done by their merits what are their skills as a voice actor Martin Sheen sounds like Martin Sheen he's not hiding that this is Martin Sheen playing a role but I doubt he'd be able to go in and be a different voice than Martin Sheen you know what I mean
That's my point.
So I kind of agree and kind of don't.
Just saying.
Just saying.
All right.
Well, any other last-minute stories to share tonight?
Um, there's a new Kickstarter for a game that's, I guess, being built on the Rage engine.
And it's called Ravaged.
And I guess it's supposed to be like a multiplayer type game.
I guess Rage, you know, they were kind of promising this big multiplayer thing and it never really happened.
um so now it's this um oh it's being based in unreal 3 and it's gonna look like rage though so ravaged multiplayer kind of rage type game post-apocalyptic car racing gun fighting looks neat
Oh, and speaking of Kickstarter, that retro... Was it the Retro Game 101?
Yeah, you mentioned that last week.
Already hit it, right?
Yeah, they already hit it.
I'm surprised.
So Kickstarter is still working for some folks.
Yeah.
Some of us thought it would be a fad, but it's still going for some.
Yeah, speaking of Kickstarter, episode 8 out of 9 for Video Game High School.
So the last episode of this season is going to be on Thursday.
Can't wait, because it's been kind of frustrating.
And hopefully it's going to turn around for the last episode.
But yeah, I've liked it so far, though.
All right.
Well, that is going to bring to close another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
But before we say goodnight, of course, we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and say goodnight.
Alan, I want to thank you for joining us in studio tonight.
And your wit and humor is always appreciated on the show.
Thank you.
Bring more of it next time.
You're really funny.
Yeah.
I want the listeners to hear more of it.
I've been making dinner for like the last 20 minutes.
Understandable.
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
Um, Strawberry Pinkberry in the freezer.
It's awesome.
And the apartment is really clean and I have laundry to fold.
That's it.
And that was really all you.
I was a lazy bitch today and Alan was like, I'm gonna clean.
Although I did get the bed propped up and you know, all that stuff, so.
And we need more people on our Origin friends list for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
Soon, soon.
If you're in the all army, message me or Sky.
Do you have your name?
I'm AlanAlchemy78 on Origin.
So play with us.
Play with me.
Although my galaxy is already at 100%.
still, multiplayer is really fun especially with friends anyhow, Loki, your final thought tonight I don't even know how much money those guys must have thrown at this crappy game in order to get it finished in that amount of time because I'm on the first challenge right now which is to find 4 80s themed lunch boxes and I found one in like the last 3 hours I don't even know how it's possible, they must have spent hundreds of dollars on this
And it's fucking boring.
I hate this game.
So much.
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
I have a little bit of brain freeze.
And Garrus.
My final thought tonight is happy Canada Day.
First, I would like to learn how to speak.
Poutine!
Second, happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.
I'm hoping to come visit your country again.
I had an absolute blast time in my life last time I was there, which was six years ago, which was far too long.
And last time was Vancouver, and next time I'm thinking Toronto.
Right, Alan?
Yes, yes.
So we'll see.
So yes, happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there and the not so beautiful ones too.
Although I saw nothing but good looking people when I was in Vancouver.
I will also say happy 4th of July to my fellow Americans this week.
Be safe.
Please do not set people's roofs on fire.
If you're going to do fireworks, especially illegal ones, have your bucket of water ready and just...
Freaking be safe with it.
Don't blow your finger off.
Don't be stupid.
The 4th of July is not to celebrate stupidity.
What up?
G asked if you ever said what the secret was.
What secret?
You said that you had a secret.
That I went back to Final Fantasy XI.
Oh, okay.
Did you know that before tonight?
Yeah, actually I did.
How did you know?
Because I saw your thing pop up.
Sky is playing...
Oh, I would have thought you would have said something if that was the case, like addict.
Didn't care.
Loki didn't know.
All right.
Sorry.
If someone does want to help me with this, all they have to do is they can play the app Ultimate Collector and then send me energy or money.
I got a frown from Acidic Vampire because I'm only talking about PC Mass Effect and you only plug the PC Mass Effect.
Of course I still play on 360 too.
In fact, my unlocks on 360 are way better.
And guess what I did?
What?
I brought back your game.
Yay!
You know what's sad?
Even though I have 1 and 2 on PC now, I think I'm going to do the replays on Xbox to get the rest of the achievements because I'm sad.
Whore.
Alright, that's it.
If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you didn't, help spread the word.
That's all we ask.
We don't put commercials in the show.
All we ask, spread the word.
Tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.
Help grow our family.
We had a new caller tonight.
We had some new faces tonight in chat.
I really want to thank all you guys for taking the time out to listen to Orange Lounge Radio and help grow.
10 more years started tonight, and it'll continue next week on Alan's Birthday Show!
Yay!
Except, not really, but that's what we're gonna call it anyway.
Have a great night, everybody.
