Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, July 29th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
Will one new non-MMO game require a monthly fee?

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Game developers speak up on Windows 8

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And could used digital games soon be a reality in the US?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
It is episode number 467 for this July 29th, 2012

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
To talk about video games, gaming culture, you know, our community

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
And cool things, and off-topic things

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
With my co-hosts, say hello to the one and only

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
How are you? Welcome back

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hi

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
How was the wedding? You were in Vegas last week for a wedding, right?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It was very lovely

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
And very Jewish

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Congratulations to Dan and Tiara once again

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Even though we said it about five times last week

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
There was an open bar

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Was there?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, then you had a blast at the wedding

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
I had many, many amaretto sours and raspberry vodka with cranberry sauce

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Cranberry juice

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Cranberries, gross

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
And mudslides and other things that people just put in front of me

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
And said, here, drink this, and champagne

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
So you'll drink anything someone puts in front of you?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
No

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Oh

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
People that I know and trust to put liquor in front of me

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Nice, nice

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
It was very good, it had a very good time

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
And it was good to see everybody

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
And get my nails did

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
So, yeah

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Awesome

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Alright, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Hi

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
How are you, Loki?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm doing good

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Good times

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I like your shirt, by the way

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
You're wearing a shirt that actually says, Loki Charms

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Yes, it was the ripped apparel shirt from a couple days ago

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I like it

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Or actually about a week ago

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Oh, yeah?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Alright

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
We have a special guest joining us tonight here in studio

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
And some of you old school Orange Lounge Radio fans might remember her

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Because she has been on the show before, but it's been a very long time

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I am so happy to welcome back to the show

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Marissa

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Hello

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
How are you, Marissa?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm great, how are you?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
I am fantastic

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Thank you so much for coming back to Orange Lounge Radio

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Great to be here

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
For those who don't remember

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
All you need to see are her boobies

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
They are very nice breasts

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
And I don't mean to sound like a pig or whatever

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
But, I mean, seriously, girl

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
They entered the room before me

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Don't forget to talk right into that microphone

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Because it's not very sensitive, unfortunately

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
So they can barely hear you

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
It's not nearly as sensitive as Rob

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I mean, I have to do it because it's been years later

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Why am I not, I'm not here

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Is the mic on?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Testes one, two

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
I don't know, it's like very quiet for some reason

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Why don't you just pick up Loki's mic?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Hello, hello?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Hello, is that better?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Much better, now I can actually hear you

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Alright, how are you Marissa?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm great, thank you

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Despite the technical failure

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Why don't you tell the boys and girls listening at home

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
And in PlayStation Home, which I'll get to in a minute

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I haven't forgotten you guys

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Why don't you tell them about yourself real quick

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Well, I'm a music geek

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Singer-songwriter and, you know, collector of vinyl

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
And all sorts of music

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
And I also, as far with regard to gaming

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm an adventure game geek

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
You know, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And King's Quest and, you know, things as such

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I'm not really that up to date with the modern stuff

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
But there have been some recent, you know, not that recent

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
But, you know, adventure games

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
You hear a little blip about them every now and again

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
They're having a nice little renaissance

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Thanks to, kind of, a lot of the stuff that Telltale's been doing

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
And the indie community especially has been very big on this

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Like, I know there was the King's Quest fan thing

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
The silver lining, which was really awesome

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And, you know, the fan community's just great for that stuff

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
That was great

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
So, actually, I came up here specifically to see this band, Prilosis

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And if any of the buddies in Sacramento, I highly recommend that you check them out

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
They're a metal band

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
They're also actually hilarious

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
They have a great YouTube channel

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
It's P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
And that's also Prilosis.com

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And for anybody that's into metal music, I just had to recommend them

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Because that was a lot of fun and they're fantastic

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
But that's more music geekery for me

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
That's no problem because now the network is about everything geek

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It's voice of geeks

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So, a little music geekery on our show, it's A-OK

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Especially for metal fans

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
You know, I'm not even actually a metal fan by nature

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
But I really enjoyed it

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
They're really melodic

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
And it's just amazing, though, how one can expand your horizons

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Especially when it involves people that are really musically gifted

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
But you do a lot of music playing yourself, right?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I do a little bit of singer-songwriter stuff

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Bitching about ex-boyfriends with an acoustic guitar and stuff like that

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So you're like a Lilith Fair, basically

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Not that bad, but

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm doing a lot of jazz covers recently

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I have a guitar player and it's been a lot of fun

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Hanging out at this place called Kulak's Woodshed North Hollywood

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
And they webcast actually live all their shows

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Nice

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And it's kind of a singer-songwriter deal as well

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Very cool

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, welcome all the way from LA

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Appreciate you stopping by tonight

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So happy to see everyone

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Speaking of live webcasting, I'm going to transition to this

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
This is going on tonight, a little special event

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
The VOG Network got asked to be a part of

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
PlayStation Home Summerfest is going on right now, live

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
And I know we have some new listeners tonight

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Because of the PlayStation Home Summerfest

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I will say this is an unofficial event

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
It's not something that Sony is really sponsoring

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
But I bet they're really happy it's going on

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Because there's lots of people

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
It's fan-organized and lots of different communities

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Be they gaming communities or PlayStation Home specific communities

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And so forth are coming together

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
To basically put on a week-long event of

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Hey, let's get a bunch of awesome people together

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And, you know, dance, have contests

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Talk to each other, kind of get a chance to meet new people

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
And I spent all of the last hour during Bobby Blackwolf's show

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Because he's before us live at vognetwork.com on Sunday nights

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, right before us

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
I was in PlayStation Home during his show

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
And just kind of really seeing the community

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
It was almost like watching an episode of Cheers

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Where people would show up

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Norm!

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Everybody seemed to know each other

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I thought it was really cool

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
In a way I felt like an outsider

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
But everybody was super welcoming

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
It was like saying hello when I was talking about VOG

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And people were actually pretty receptive

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
During Bobby's show he got a caller from somebody

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
That had never listened to VOG before

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
But was listening because of PlayStation Home

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And I just thought that was a great cross-promotional opportunity

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
So if you are listening live

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And you are in PlayStation Home

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I do want to point out Bobby Blackwolf is in there now

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
And he's going to be feeding me comments from PlayStation Home

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
To possibly read during the show

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
He just got there

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
So give him a big hello

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
And be sure to shout out hogwash for him

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
So he can see

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
That's become the rally cry of tonight in PlayStation Home

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
I noticed that during Bobby's show earlier

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
Of course if you want to do things the old fashioned way

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Nothing wrong with that

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
I'm not going to ignore you guys

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
In our always present chat room

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Live.vognetwork.com

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Is where the traditional IRC based chat room is

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
If you want to join that and chat along with the show

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
You can also check in to the show at VOG Network

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
As we are live here and get your VOG points

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
And maybe a little bit of loot

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Alright

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Stan in our chat room

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
At live.vognetwork.com starts us off tonight saying

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Rob is there a way to stream the live podcast

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
On PlayStation Home

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Cause I'll switch if I can

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
You know sadly I don't think that's something that's possible yet

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Because I don't think you can really do

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Like streaming music or any of that yet

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
We should all let Sony know that's something we want in the future though

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Cause how awesome would it be if in that VOG Network clubhouse

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
We could actually have like a VOG Network feed

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
That would be like the best thing ever

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
So who knows anything's possible in the future

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
So BlackWolf is reporting that

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
From PlayStation Home

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
That the club channels just died again

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Our party is crashing the servers y'all

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Do we know how to party or what?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
Alright

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Anyhow so yes again a big hello to you guys

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
At PlayStation Home who are listening tonight

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Let me throw out some names I remember from before

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Manda Panda

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Jay

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Steven

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Junebug

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
That guy who had the 91 on the back of his shirt

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
That made me feel insignificant no just kidding

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
But yeah I want to say hi to all you guys who are

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Listening right now

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Alright

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And also some of the

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
OL Army and VOG regulars

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Are in Home Summerfest right now

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I saw Tigerclaw in there earlier and I saw

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Spaznators and some of the other people

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So that's pretty cool there's kind of the cross

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Promotion stuff going on so that's what it's all about

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
It's just promoting community and

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And cool people meeting other cool people

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
I know PlayStation Home

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Has had it's share of you know

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Some people still don't get it

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And I even admit I've sometimes

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Been a little critical of Home on the show

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
But that has nothing to do with the community

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
That's only about the software

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
That sometimes it can be a little slow

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And tough to connect to things but

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It really has changed a lot

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Since that first beta

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So if you haven't checked out PlayStation Home in the past three years

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Seriously there's like a million mini

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Games now tons of prizes you can

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Get for your avatar and just like cool little

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Knick knacks it really is worth checking

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Out if for nothing else than just to

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Meet some of the awesome people that are on

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
The PlayStation Home community

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Alright

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Before we get started with

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Tonight's show I wanted to do a quick

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Kickoff topic which I think might have

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Been just saying hello to Marissa and

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Interviewing her a little bit

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Let's see Marissa

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
So you like adventure games

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
What is your favorite video game

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Ever?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
It really does have to be Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I really just love that game

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Do you have a thing for Harrison Ford? Let's be real

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
No but I have a thing for fedoras

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I really do

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Damn I left mine out in the car

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
No true story

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
One of my other passions besides internet radio and video games

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
I have been a member of like live shadow casting

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
For midnight movies like Rocky Horror Picture

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Show especially right for like

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
12 years well lately

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I've started doing stuff with Repo the genetic

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Opera which is you know one of this

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Yeah that's kind of I hate

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Calling it the new Rocky Horror because it's not

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It's just a new

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Cool phenomenon that also happens to be

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
At midnight

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Exactly it's kind of like the shadow casting

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Thing of the now and last night

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
They did the 80's repo show

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
And I got to do Indiana Jones in a

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Special cameo which was awesome

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Did you bring your whip?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
They did a joke

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Where the Paris Hilton

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Character Amber Sweet is kind of like a dominatrix

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
So they did a joke where I came out

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
As Indiana Jones

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
And she stole my whip

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
That was kind of the joke which was super cute

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
But the audience cheered

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And I felt hot

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Awesome

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It was a good time anyhow

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Let's get to video games

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Speaking of games I know where to start

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
This week Loki I want to talk to you for a minute

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Alright so you've been talking

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
For weeks about this

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Contest this competition you

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Were going to be at this weekend

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Let's hear about it how did it go?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It was terrible

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Ok what was this that you went to?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Ok so I went to a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Contest it was going to be 2 on 2

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And you know for a while I was trying

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
To find someone to go with and I had my

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
One of my friends brothers was going to go

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
With me and so everything sounded

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Cool because he plays a lot of you know

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Call of Duty I play

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Quite a bit and you know

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
The rules were a little weird

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
It was basically custom classes

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
But there were certain restrictions on what kind

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Of loadout you can have and that was fine

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
I practiced with you know the loadout

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
That I could

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
Work with in the

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Rules of the

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Tournament and so I was kind of ready

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I had everything set up

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Ok so here comes Friday

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
You know the Friday before

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
The tournament

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Literally about 2 o'clock

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
My co-op

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Partner drops out

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
So I have no one to go with

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
So I'm like fantastic ok

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
So I you know I

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Call my friend Sean I'm like hey

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Does your other brother play

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Because you know and he's like yeah he plays

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Let me see if he can go

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
No he's got things he's

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Doing ok fine

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
Alright that's fine you know

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I'll just find someone to play

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
With when I go down there or

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I will just you know

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I'll play one against two

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
That should be ok with you know I'll take them both on

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Exactly with the loadout I had

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
So I drive these guys are gonna all be what

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
16 I'll take them all

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
So I drove down there

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Like an hour and a half down to

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Stockton and

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
So I'm

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
At the shopping center where this place is

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
And I can't find it at first so I

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Look up on Facebook because

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
This plaza is actually

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
On both sides of the street I'm like oh that's probably

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
On the other side of the street let me just look up where it's at

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
So when I go to look it up

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
I notice that there's an update in the events

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Oh by the way

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
We changed all the rules

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Oh how convenient thank you

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
How convenient so they're all oh by the way

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Now we're not doing custom classes we're just doing

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
The standard classes that are there

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
And with no restrictions I'm like

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
You gotta be fucking

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Kidding me I drove all I'm like fine

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
You know what I drove all this way

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
I'm gonna play at least

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So I get there sign up and everything oh by the way

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Now we're gonna not do kill streaks

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
So it's like what the fuck

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
So ok so fine whatever I'll play

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
So I got hooked up with somebody else

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
And then it was just kind of it just kept going

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Downhill from there oh yeah

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
We don't have headphones for

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Anybody so you can't really hear what's going on in the game

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Oh um

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
The person that we

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
Put you with he doesn't even

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Really understand what kind of tournament it is

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
And he thinks it's a free for all tournament

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
First and then finally figures out

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
It's a co-op tournament so at this point

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm like there's no fucking way we're gonna even win

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
One round and that's exactly what happened we played

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
First and we lost both of our rounds immediately

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Because it was just a clusterfuck

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
I guess I had been practicing

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
With a certain class all week long

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Per expectations to the tournament

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And then they fucking switched it all up on me

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
So I'm like god damn it I don't know what fucking class I'm gonna play

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
And did they ask you, you mad bra?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Oh no oh it gets better than that

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It gets better I'm like ok so what the hell

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I mean why did you guys change the instructions

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh well it's actually supposed to be standard classes

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
All along but that's what we've been telling everybody

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
That's been coming in here you know the past few weeks

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Oh the past few weeks so you've known

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
About this shit and you've been telling everybody

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Oh but you fucking failed to update it

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
On Facebook so that you know people that were

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Coming out of town would know anything about it

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Well I don't know I'm just

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I'm just working here

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
It was a big fucking mess

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
So yes I didn't enjoy

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
Myself but at least you know what at least I didn't

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Spend that much time in Stockton

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I played for a few minutes

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I got to meet with my customer and devs

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Down there and I left and that was it

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Dungeonbuster in our chat room at

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Live.vognetwork.com says the rage

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Gauge is nearing critical

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
DJ Morpheus is counting the number of F bombs

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
That you're dropping I do want to

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Because we do have an influx of new listeners

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Tonight thanks in part in

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Large part to the Playstation Home Summerfest

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I just want to remind everybody it is a mature

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Audiences show so please put the kids to

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Bed or put headphones on

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Let's be honest I mean come on I mean there's

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
People that I've been to video game tournaments

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Before you don't go to a tournament

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
That changes the fucking rules

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Nah that's messed up like 10 minutes before the

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Tournament starts like back in the day if it was like a

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
DDR tournament like oh man

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
That tournament would have been smeared on DDR

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
The next day yeah it's just it's

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
The next day the same day

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
The same day it was ridiculous

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
We couldn't we didn't have live blogging back

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
In that day but we had laptops at

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Tournaments there was but see no one else was

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Pissed there except for me because everybody else

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Everybody else there was local and so they

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Had been in the shop at least a couple times

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Before you know tournaments started so they

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Were aware of the the change in the rules

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
But no one fucking mentioned it

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
At all it was just

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It was really annoying but whatever you know what

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I I even like

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I contemplate I'm like do I really want to drive down

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Stockton since it's just going to be myself you know

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I do want to point out Wicked is in our

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Chat room right now saying yay Loki

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Was in my neck of the woods

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
So you are bashing one of our listeners

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Hometowns right now but let's be real

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Dude bro you live in Stockton

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You know what though

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Your city's bankrupt

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Let me put it this way it at least

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
The tournament was in a

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Seemed like a good portion of Stockton like the

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
The shopping mall was actually pretty

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Nice I mean so

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
A compliment from Loki everybody

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
The mall was nice

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Was it by the S Mart?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I don't know where the S Mart is but

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
But there you know in the game

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Store was nice it's just I'm unfortunately

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
You have an idiot running your goddamn tournaments

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That's the only problem and I don't know

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It may very well be that this guy

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Is new to running tournaments because I hear

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
That their fighting game tournaments run okay

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
But then again I'm sure they're not switching up

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Rules you know it'd be funny

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Hey let's go play

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 tournament

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Oh and the reason too

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
The reason that they changed up all the rules is because

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Oh well we didn't want someone to say

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Oh well the only reason you won is because you got this kill streak

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And the helicopter killed me

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Too fucking bad you can get the kill streak too

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Damn it that's what I was planning

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Exactly too fucking bad if you get killed by something

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Or a certain gun or something

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
That classes have

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
You have all of these guns available to you

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And you're playing by the same rules

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Why can't you fucking just suck it up

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
That you just sucked instead of

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Forcing these people

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Which I say to just succumb to their peer pressure

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
To change the rules at the very last second

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Because

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Oh we don't want to hear someone bitching wine

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Well you know what you're fucking hearing me bitching wine about it now

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Because I had to drive 90 fucking minutes

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
To your stupid tournament

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
Which I will

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Oh and by the way

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I love my customer but

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
I'm like so are you coming back for Stockton Fest

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I'm like no I'm not fucking coming back to Stockton Fest

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I am not driving to Stockton ever again

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
When I drive to LA

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I will drive around Stockton

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The last time I went to Stockton someone stole my Xbox

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
This time I went to Stockton

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Fucking tournament sucked

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm not coming back to Stockton

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
There will not be a three strike law here

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
This is two strikes we're done

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I'm not going back to Stockton

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Wicked in our chat says

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Trust me if I didn't have to live here

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
I wouldn't

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Hey trust me

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I'm sure it's just

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
It has nothing to do with Stockton

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
This could have been run in Sacramento and had an idiot running tournament

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
It doesn't matter

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You don't fucking change the rules

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
At the last second

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Okay if you're going to change the rules

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I can understand if it was like

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Hey you know what you guys

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
We said all these restrictions

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Are in place

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
But we're just going to lift the restrictions now

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Okay that's not so bad

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Because I can still play with the class I had

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Or I can change it up a little bit

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Instead of oh by the way now you have to stick to one of these

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Six classes

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Oh and you know that sucked

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And you can at least get some killstreaks and stuff

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
But we're going to take those away too

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Wicked in our chat room says

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Aw you won't come back to Stockton

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Not even if I bake cookies

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
No

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Sorry

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm going to vomit all over the entire town

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
We're going to have to broker like a Loki Stockton

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Peace Summit in like Lodi or something

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I don't know

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
We're going to have to figure that one out

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Alright look we're too many local jokes

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It's a worldwide show

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
The rule I mean just

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The lesson to be learned here is

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
You got to be I guess you have to be aware of how the

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Wherever local stores

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Are running a tournament

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
How they handle things

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Because I mean honestly no one should be changing the rules

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And I noticed they deleted the event

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
On Facebook so no one can comment

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
On it or anything

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
They must have had a few

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Angry people

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Who won?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
I don't care I wasn't going to stick around

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Who cares like I felt bad for the guy

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
That was playing with me I'm like well

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Like is it like the second game

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Basically it was

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Oh and that was the other thing they changed too because it was single

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Elimination first and then it was like oh best two out of three now

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I'm like is it best two out of three or single

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Elimination well it's best two out of three then

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
If you lose once then you're out

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Okay fine

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That doesn't even make sense

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Whoever loses the best two out of three

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
And then or wins the best two out of three moves on

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Then the loser is done

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
They so we did this

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
So we lost our first round because it was like okay

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Let's try to get ahead and we were doing alright

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I mean it wasn't like we lost by a whole

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Ton

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
It's still you know quite a few

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Points but it wasn't like you know

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We had 100 points and they had

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
2500 or something it was pretty decent

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
But

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
You know we had already lost our first game so that put us at a disadvantage

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
For the second round because the second round it's like well

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
We have to come to them because they're not

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
You know in order to

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Win this and so it just unfortunately

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
We had the advantage there

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Alright we have a comment coming out of Playstation Home

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
The man Bobby Black Wolf is in he does

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
The show before us Sunday nights

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
On VOG Network he is in Playstation Home

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Right now feeding me comments because I can't

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I can't see the TV it's too far away

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I'm in there doing the running man I can see everybody

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
In the circle doing the running man which was

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Cracking Marissa up when she walked through the door

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
But I can't actually read

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The chat because it's too far away

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
But Black Wolf says the spasinator

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
In Home says if Loki vomited

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
All over Stockton he'd probably

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Improve the place

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
A circle of running men just sounds

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Dirty too

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Alright

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Let's talk about our gaming

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Weeks and the other actual games

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
We've been playing this week hopefully not at

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Tournaments in Stockton that caused us to rage

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Dark Soccer we'll start with you tonight

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
How was your gaming week?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It was Mass Effect-y

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
That was really about it

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Because that's really about all I played that and

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Some words with friends

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Ewww Zynga game

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Whatever Judging you

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Whatever No I know it's popular

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It's real popular I don't care if it's popular

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's addicting I've been playing a really

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Addicted game I mean I'm like cutting and talking

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
About something in my week real quick but I've been

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Playing well no this is important

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I've been playing when don't I ever

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Make a topic about me Dark Soccer

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Even over what 10 years alright

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
More than that

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
There's a game on iPhone called

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Song Pop I think is the name of it right

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Now and it's really fun it's like guess the song

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
As fast as you can like it's like

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Name that tune yeah yeah right

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
So you gotta check this out but here's

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
The problem we're all just looking at our

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Watches counting down how long before

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Zynga buys them

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
How long before Zynga buys them

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Well Zynga's already getting burned because I think they're

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Starting to realize that's ooh

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I heard there's like all this I don't think it's

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
In our show tonight there's like all this scandal

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Like the guy sold his stock like the CEO

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Sold like a bunch of his stock like two months

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Ago and then they had the report

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Like you know insider trading

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Investigation since you interrupted I'm gonna

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Interrupt you as well that's cool since we're talking

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
About Facebook games and stuff

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Let's talk about Facebook real quick

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Facebook in case anyone

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Hasn't fucking noticed

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Is a little broken right now

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Because you cannot

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Unsubscribe from people's comments and likes

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Or updates by games

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
I try I don't fucking care about

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Your stupid song game or whatever

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I'm trying to hide that shit but Facebook

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Does not want to let you know what's funny I thought

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I set all that shit to private

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Like are you seeing my song song other people

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Oh okay Bobby

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
It's alright and you know I don't mind

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
That kind of stuff it's mainly people

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Commenting on other people's like cat photos

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
I really don't care if you think that's a cute cat

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Or not but it's it's up

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
It's Facebook's problem because all that stuff

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Was hidden before and now it's not

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I just want to make it known that this is an

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Issue so everybody can also make it

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Known to their friends that this is an issue because

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
It no one seems to be fixing it

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
It's been like this for a week I think the real

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Issue is that I heard this one into

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Place a couple weeks ago like if in group

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Let's say you're in a group and you make

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
A post in that group now

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
You can see when everybody

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Read that post uh-huh

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I kind of think that's like a privacy violation

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
In messages surprise

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I want to be able to stalk people with

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Impunity

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Exactly I can see that too with

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Messages direct messages that you send to people

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
On Facebook you can see if they've read it or not

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Whatever happened

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
To good old fashioned anonymous ignoring you

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
It's just like those emails with read

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Receipts and stuff like that I love deleting

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Those before they get sent

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It's terrible well actually

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I mean I have to

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Bitch about Facebook too because they're totally

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
Fucking over page owners right now

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I mean I would I understand

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
That you know that they're a for profit entity

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And they have to make money but I operate I operate

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Several pages myself for musicians

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And one for a venue that I work for

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
And you know it's very important for our

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
That mic is cutting in and out sorry about that

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Live radio kids hello love ya

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Okay burning with fire

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
I know um

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah I operate several pages for musicians

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And for venues and for a venue that I work for

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And um I completely

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Understand that Facebook is a for profit

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Entity and they need to make money

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
So I'd be happy to pay for extra features

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
However to pay for just

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Basic exposure that would normally if you were

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
On a friends page would just go out to all of

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Your friends is bullshit I'm sorry

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
On Facebook you pay with your

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Soul this is true

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm not gonna how do you like your Farmville

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Now

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I completely agree

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
But yeah I mean page owners if you didn't know that already

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Your um your posts

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Aren't getting Zuckerberg is watching you

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Masturbate Shalom

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I'm allowed

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
To say that

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
For the record

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
But yeah

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I mean if you

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
For any page owners that didn't know this earlier

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Unless you're you know paying for their extra services

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
You make a post to um on your page

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It's not going to reach your whole audience

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
At all Marissa we really just need

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
To show on vog where we giggle for an hour

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
This is true

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Giggle time

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Oh dear what have I started

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Tickle fest

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Yay

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Alright

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Oh yeah this was Dark Soccer's gaming week at one point

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Well fuck all that I'm looking up

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Mass Effect t-shirts

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I was not familiar with Mass Effect

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
And Jamie did introduce me to that character

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Glorious Baritone he is lovely

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Oh he's a lovely voice

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
The guy that was his voice actor was on

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
An episode of Buffy as like this real douchebag

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Who was like this horrible character

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Oh really? Yeah it was in season 7

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
So it doesn't count

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Can you celebrate your heart?

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
He has a very nice lower register that's all I can say

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Well then Marissa I'll ask you about your gaming week

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
It sounds like you got exposed to Mass Effect

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
A little bit

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
My new wallpaper by the way is the

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Citadel smooch

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That's it? Watching other people

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Play Modern Warfare and then getting

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yelled at for stealing their bandwidth

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Has pretty much been the rest of my gaming week

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
God dammit are you on the internet

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Sorry

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
That's like Sunday nights at OLR

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
When Alan mistakenly

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Downloads BitTorrents God dammit are you getting porn?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Trying to do a show

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I'm trying to

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Hack into our neighbor's connection

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
His connection's name is Mr. Touchy's

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Uncle Touchy's puzzle basement

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
But I haven't been able to figure out his code yet

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
It's a Patton Oswalt joke

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
As long as it's

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
You won't wear a shirt and you'll cry

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
You can hack it pretty easy

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I can send you the link

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Lifehacker had an article on it

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Alright

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
We'll go move on to Loki

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Loki how was your gaming week besides Stockton?

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Hey Stockton just was unfortunate

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
But this week

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
I didn't even finish mine

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
I thought you were done

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Fuck you fuck everybody

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm bi

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Alright you're done

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Okay so um

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
No no no no no hold on

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I had to walk away so I wouldn't time out of home

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
You said and I quote

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
I've just been playing Mass Effect

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I might have played other things

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
But when you say

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I just played Mass Effect

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Well I did just play Mass Effect before we left the house

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
That is true

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
She made it sound like

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Oh forget it I'm not having a grammar war

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
With this woman

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Fine lady how was the rest of your gaming week?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Uneventful

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
She is a level

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
She is a level 50 grammar knight by the way

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
She's a level 50 bitch right now

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
No Rob 69

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I'm sorry bitch it's a subclass

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
You need to put a B in a circle on the back of your shirt

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
When you go into Playstation home

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Alright Loki how was your gaming week?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Now do I have permission to move on to the show?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Carry on carry on

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Thank you

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
How are you enjoying hosting the Olympics your queen?

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
All these countries used to be mine

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
No I have to do

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I have to do the proper

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
All of these countries used to be mine

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
We are not amused

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
May the odds be ever in your favor

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Okay alright Loki

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Now you may proceed

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So this week I played well Call of Duty

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Of course

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Also played a little bit of Borderlands

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
And a little bit of Just Cause 2

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Had to stop playing Just Cause 2

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Cause my computer felt like it was gonna melt down

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Which means I had to

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Make some modifications

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
It ended up that my cat apparently

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Was using the inside of my

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Or the heat fins for my

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Cooler inside my

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Laptop as a lint

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Collector and so there was a

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Nice layer of cat hair in there that I

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Found when I

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Disassembled everything so

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Thankfully that was easily remedied and then

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I drilled holes in the bottom of it

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Because

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
These Asus laptops, the older ones

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Just had really piss poor

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Cooling so it's actually helped

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
A lot and um

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
It doesn't feel like I'm shooting fire

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Out of the side of my laptop right now

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Um and then

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I got

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
It's never good to have a hot laptop on your crotch

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Because then you really get fire crotch

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Well then you have

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Roasted sausage

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
No no I used to

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I have a cooling pad

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
They put on there but yes before when I

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Icy hot?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
A metal

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Metal pad with fans in it

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Anyways um no but when I had

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Before I had all the

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Cooling modifications to it I would burn my

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Legs playing games on

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
My laptop so yes that's

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
It is possible to do that

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And it got so hot too that

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Like I was burning my hands not

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Touching my laptop on top of

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
My keys it was just getting that hot

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
I'm like okay starting to smell things

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Burning probably should cool it off

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Wow um so yeah

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
So I think we're good we're in a good spot

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Now because all the other spots that I haven't

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Drilled holes in don't really have any processors

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Underneath them so it's probably not

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Necessary um and then

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Played Minecraft a bit more of that that's

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
Kind of fun we just started kind of exploring

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
The area and the new

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
What was it uh

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Octocock Minecraft

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Scene um

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
It's actually a very boring map so

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I might want to start another one

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Um and then

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Um what else

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Oh I have a beta key

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
For the little big planet carding thing

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
I haven't gotten a chance to try yet

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Thank you Loki by the way

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
No problem um

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
And

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
That's pretty much it I just have a lot of stuff

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm you know a lot of it was just

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Hinging on cooling my laptop down so I can play

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
More Borderlands again because it was just getting

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
So hot I'm like I don't want to break anything

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
In there alright

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Talking about my gaming week um I played

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Borderlands a little bit I was really

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Busy during the weekend because of the shadow casting

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Events going on this weekend but um earlier in the week

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
I played Borderlands like a little more

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Seriously this time I mean not

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
A lot a lot I only probably got to like level

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
10 or 11 which you know is is

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Change in the scope of things but it gave

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Me enough time to get a better feel for the game than what I

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Played of it before and I like it it's

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Kind of like I think

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
The description of World of Warcraft

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
As a first person shooter is somewhat

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Accurate except it's not really an MMO

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
But you can play the multiplayer

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
That was the only thing that felt a little

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Disjointed for me and like this is gonna

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Sound negative but it's really not like I do really

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Enjoy the game you guys but I kind of thought

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
It was weird that like it's the same you can use

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
The same character in your single player

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And in multiplayer I know

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
You can use different too but it was

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
It just felt a little disjointed like here I

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Am doing some quests in single player and then here

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
We are multiplayer and so

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And so is kind of off doing this and so is off doing

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
This and kind of like we're all completing quests

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm not able to really follow along I'm not

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Able to get into it as easy so it's kind of like

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I feel the need to play through this game

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Once single player just

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
To like know the story

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And know everything and then go back and do

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Multiplayer and

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Okay for real GameSpy

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Is the multiplayer client like what is this

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
1998

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
But

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Okay I realize the game is a few years old

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm not gonna I'm hoping Borderlands

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm hoping Borderlands 2 uses

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Something a little more modern

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
That just kind of surprised me I'm like

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
You know I'm missing origin

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Right about now Maybe it runs really well

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Because no one uses GameSpy anymore

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Maybe maybe maybe that's the secret

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
I don't know but yeah I mean

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Borderlands was it's fun I mean

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
It's more of an actual

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Like shooter than like Mass Effect

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Which I was talking about before that

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
You know remember I said I was playing a lot of Mass Effect

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Multiplayer and it makes me want to play a first person shooter

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Because I'm really enjoying Mass Effect

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
And the most people suggested I play Borderlands

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
I think it was a great suggestion

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
It is a little more first person shootery than I'm used to

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
And I was surprised I couldn't dumb the difficulty

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Down because I like to play my shooters in

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Easy noob noob mode

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
But there is no difficulty

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah you gotta hax it though

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You gotta hax it

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I didn't want to do that

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm doing alright so far

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Multiplayer kicked our butt

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Like because the enemies get so much stronger

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
And now it's not just one guy running around

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Not knowing what they're doing it's three

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
This is me and two buddies of mine

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
We can certainly play later on

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I know Bobby's got it, Allen's got it now

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Lots of people in the Borderlands

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Otherwise for me I've been playing

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
A lot of the same stuff

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Otherwise not a lot of new new stuff

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
This week you know World of Warcraft

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
And all that good stuff

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I'm eagerly awaiting

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Thanks to Loki I got a beta test code

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
For the little big planet karting

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Super excited to try that out

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Play it as quickly as possible because it ends like Wednesday

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Oh no I'll download it tonight

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Play it Monday and Tuesday night or something

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Let you guys know my impressions on that next week

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
That ought to be of interest to the Playstation home folks

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Because that's a Sony exclusive

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
We got some codes that we can give away too

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
You say we have extra codes to give away?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Yeah we do

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Maybe we need to do a giveaway tonight

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
In the Playstation home clubhouse

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
That'd be fun

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I think like three extra codes

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
We'll think of a way to do a contest

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
I don't want to ignore the folks in our live chat room either

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Maybe we'll give some codes away in some different places tonight

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Guess Marissa's cup size is the contest?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I can guess what it is

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I told you

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I don't know about that

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Alright

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I gotta keep it

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
We might be a mature show

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
But I want to keep it somewhat

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
PG-13 at least in home

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Out of respect to the community

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Keep it a little PG-13 there

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Too big is the answer

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Alright

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Shane is messaging me

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Going I want a freaking code

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Well Shane that's what you get for bragging about

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
The Playstation all stars

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Network battle

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Royale thingy that you were in the beta for

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
And I was like let me play

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You know what his answer was? No

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
Alright

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Let's move on

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I think we covered everybody's gaming week

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Yes yes yes alright

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Housekeeping

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I want to talk about this

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
This is something a little special

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
No this is serious for a minute

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
A little special and unique on the VoG network

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
And I think this is really cool

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And kind of shows some of the different stuff we can do

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
So next week after Orange Lounge Radio

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
That's right after Orange Lounge Radio

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I think we've been doing this show like 10 years

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Have we ever had another show follow us?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Like usually we're the last show of the night right?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Because it's like 1am on the east coast by the time

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
We're done sometimes

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Well next week there is going to be a special

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Show following us

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
At VoG network.com

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I know it's very late

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I know it's a long time to stay up

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
But this is very cool

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Travis Donovan from Understation Live

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
Is going to be doing a special live

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
VoG coverage of the Mars

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
City Landing

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
So I think that's really cool

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Like Travis if you listen to

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Understation Live at all which is on Saturday nights

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
At VoG 7 o'clock Pacific

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
He loves space

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
He loves NASA he loves the space program

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Is he the best at space?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
He might be which by the way before I forget

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Rest in peace Sally Ride for real

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Sally Ride

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Not just all the stuff that came out afterwards

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
But just Sally Ride

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I was around 5 or 6 when she first went into space

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
And I don't

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
I don't even know

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
How to put this like at such a young

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Age you're like even so happy

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
To see like a female go

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Into space like

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
And you kind of wonder as a kid

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Like on one hand you wonder why is it

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Such a big deal but on the other hand

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
You're like you feel like a lot of like happiness

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
And pride for kind of like that equality

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I remember feeling that at a young age

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And I'm not even a girl like I guess I was a feminist

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
At 5 years old who knew but

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
Anyway Sally Ride

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Amazing inspiration to men and women

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Everywhere

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Out of current events I didn't realize

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
We had set up another

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Like

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
That's just a one time special

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
No not that I'm talking about

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Sending something to Mars

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
I didn't even realize that we had

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Sent anything else to Mars

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I thought they were like ahhhh

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
We fucked up that last rover

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
We're done

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I mean that's cool

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Well you know what you should

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Tune in to Travis' special

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Next week you might learn something

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Makes sense that now they have all these Mars landing games

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Like who cares about landing on Mars now

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I mean that's like so old

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And what the hell is the world turning to when I'm learning things

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
From Travis Donovan

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Love you

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Alright

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
So I did want to plug that

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Of course I want to plug our Facebook community

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
We are on Twitter as well

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
You can follow us at at OLR

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Or you can follow the voice of geeks network as a whole

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
VOG network

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
VOG network did grow in the past couple weeks

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
With a few new shows

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Critical Myth and British Invaders

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Want to give them a shout out

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Great great television and discussion shows

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
They're both fantastic shows

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And so happy to have them on the lineup

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And of course one more shout out

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
To the folks right now doing the running man

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Or just hanging out whatever they're doing

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Playstation Summerfest is going on right now

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Looks like it's thinned out a little bit

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
There was a lot more people in there during Bobby's show

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
But you know it's getting late

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
On the east coast

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Some people got to go to bed sometimes

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Alright moving on

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Let's get into some gaming news

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I think we're just on the other side of the camera

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh was the camera just facing the wrong way?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Oh my god someone made

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
A chibi garris plushie

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
I see from back here I see it

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Junebug says thank you everyone very much

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Awesome job vog

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Thank you Junebug!

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
She won a $20 gift card during Bobby Black Wolf's show tonight

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
For Playstation Network and she called in

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And I thought that was amazing

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Shout out Junebug

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Loki starting us off tonight

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
With exclusive news

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Maybe?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I don't have all the details on this yet

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
But it was interesting

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
It's a test that they're doing

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Apparently it was that new

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Nike Plus

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
A fitness game for Kinect

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
That's coming out this fall

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Is going to require a subscription

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Service

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
In order to play the game

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Now I'm not sure exactly how that works

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Because I was asking him some questions

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
He was basically

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
The rep we had at Microsoft

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Was kind of using this

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Hey we can sell some more points cards using this

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm like aren't people going to be kind of pissed off

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
That you guys are charging 400 Microsoft points a month

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
For the service

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
I guess it's for stat tracking

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
And something like that

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Now he said

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Because I don't know too much about this game

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
He said that the game will not work unless you pay

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
This monthly fee

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
So I'm not sure what exactly

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Is entailed there

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
If it's just going to not track your progress

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
That's what the monthly fee is for

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Or if it's just

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Going to plain straight up not work

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Unless you have like

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
A pass or something

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
If you don't pay us

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You will get fat

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I don't know

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
See my thought is

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
I was just kind of

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Why

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Why are you guys doing this

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Aren't people going to look at this kind of negative

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Because I even brought up the typical things

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
I love that you called him out on it

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
You guys

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
You have your gold service that people are paying for

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Aren't you guys kind of worried that

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
This might look bad

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
They're charging a fee

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
On top of this

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
It's just a test right now

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
So I don't know

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
This is a test

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
This is only a test

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
That's me sucking money out of your wallet

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
We'll have to see what

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
We'll have to see what exactly this is

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
When it comes out

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Because I'm sure that he didn't have all the details

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Trust me, I know reps for companies

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
That don't know what the fuck they're talking about

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
When it comes to product

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
And so

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
It's very possible that he got some stuff wrong

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Or just wasn't clear on things

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Maybe it's just this whole

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Stat tracking thing that's extra

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Or something

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
But I still don't like the fact that a game

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Is requiring you for a monthly fee

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
For something that should be

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
In my opinion included with it

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
So

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
We will see when this comes out

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And if it does require this

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
That kind of sucks for them

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
There's plenty of fitness games out there

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
For the Xbox 360

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
This has to be something super special

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
The Nike Plus has

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
That whole

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Will it integrate with the shoes?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
It's going to integrate with that stuff

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Maybe that's what it is

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
I don't know if Nike Plus

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
As a service

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
The one with your shoes

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
If that requires a fee

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Maybe it's something like that

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
All I know is they're saying

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
So

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
Yep

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Five bucks a month

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I wonder if that will have to be right

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
There on the front of the box

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
That they're going to be charging that

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It won't be

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
That's scary

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Then what are you getting?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
I can see if there's a premium club

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I guess that's no different from Call of Duty

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
That's what it's going to be

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Maybe

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
If you subscribe to this

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
And you're out of it

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
That would make sense to me

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
It would be a huge mistake

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
To say this game requires

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
All this DLC

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
But that's how he phrased it

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Maybe it's just

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Him misinterpreting

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
The information he's been given

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
It's possible

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
But I'm just reporting

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
What I've been told

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
400 Microsoft Points a month

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Some people have mixed success

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Rates with those fitness games

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Brad is talking to me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Right now and he says

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Talking about fitness games

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Christina got a

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Your shape game

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
And while doing one of the initial

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Setup scans it told her

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Straighten your back

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And they cracked up because she has scoliosis

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
So her response was

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Good luck with that

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
Marissa you're...

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I can imagine Marissa playing

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
The Your Shape game

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
You seem a little top heavy

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I can't straighten my back either

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I have thighs

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Put down your groceries

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
Stop carrying that baby

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Please put down the watermelons

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Please

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I'll do ooches braziers later

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Alright

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Anything else on this topic

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Low key or can I move on

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
One more thing I forgot

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
I mentioned this week

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
I played Dead or Alive 5

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
The near final build of that

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
That's kind of cool

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
But I don't play Dead or Alive

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
So it was button mash fest

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
I didn't do very well with that until I switched to Ryu

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And then I fucking kicked ass

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
He apparently is pretty conducive for button mashing

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
It looks pretty though

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Is Dead or Alive

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I made a huge faux pas by the way

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Christina is a girlfriend not a wife

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
My bad

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Awkward

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Sorry guys

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
Back and away

46:16.000 --> 46:22.000
Did I mention what a great show pod culture is

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And you should all listen to it

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
So that I can be forgiven

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
Monday nights 6 o'clock

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
Awkward time at the dinner table

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Rob is red now

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Don't worry it's just like when people say

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
So Alan's your roommate?

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Well yeah we do live together

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
In the same room

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
And have mating practices

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
Alright hey let's move on to Windows 8

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
Marissa it's going to turn into the giggle show

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
She's over there making like she's digging a hole

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
Let's talk about someone who's almost as awesome as Brad from pod culture

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Gabe Newell

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
And he's talking about Windows 8

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
He's not a fan

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
You know Windows 8 is coming out towards the end of the year

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I believe it's been a year

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
I believe it's been officially dated for October 26

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
And it's going to be coming out

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
And a lot of people are excited about Windows 8

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
But one of them that is not excited about Windows 8

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Gabe Newell

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
He says quote a catastrophe

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
He just straight up called it a catastrophe

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
And that's according to all things D

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I think we'll lose some of the top tier PC OEMs

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Who will exit the market

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I think margins will be destroyed

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
For a bunch of people

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
If that's true then it will be good to have alternatives to hedge

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Against that eventually

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
And that is a follow up to Steam being on Linux

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
That is actually

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Now that you kind of hear that

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
You're like damn that's genius

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
That's a proactive move by Steam

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Just in case Windows 8 is a gigantic fucking bomb

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
That it turns people off

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
That's a pretty big risk in a way

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
I mean I'm sure the Linux folks are happy

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
That's crazy that all of a sudden old versions of Windows 8

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
Just disappear and become Windows 8

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That is a little interesting but

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
I mean gee what's going to happen to all those computers

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Running those older OS's

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
And people not upgrading

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Oh I guess everything will work as usual

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
That's odd

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Alright

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
But hey I guess you know you've got to be prepared

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
For the apocalypse

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
I want to come back to what Gabe Newell said in a minute

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Because he said something else

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
That was really fascinating

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
And I definitely want Jamie to hear it

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
But in the meantime I want to talk about Blizzard

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You know the makers of World of Warcraft

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
And Starcraft, Diablo

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
You might have heard of these games

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
They're kind of big in PC

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Just if you haven't heard

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
They have a new game coming out this year

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
Pandaria right

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Ok so

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Blizzard is kind of on board with this

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
It was according to Twitter

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
And a comment from game designer

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Rob Pardo

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
He said on Twitter

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
Nice interview with Gabe Newell

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Not awesome for Blizzard either

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Now keep in mind

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
This is one guy at Blizzard

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
But when he is a game designer

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Yeah

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
So there you go

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
Not some good early feedback

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
I'm hoping this isn't going to go over

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Windows ME or something

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Or Windows Vista

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Even Marista

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
The non-gamer is sitting over there going

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Oh so cold, so cold

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Wait give Marista the mic

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Marista you are not a fan of Windows ME

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
No I've actually had it in many offices

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
I've been the legal secretary

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
At many points in my life

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
And attorneys are very cheap

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
I've had to try to work with Windows ME

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
I still have nightmares

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Alright

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Let me go back to the Gabe Newell thing in a minute

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Alright Jamie listen up

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
I know this is software that is a big part

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Of what you do

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Because Gabe Newell kind of alluded

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
To programs like Adobe

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Like Photoshop

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
That causes us to have conversations

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
With Adobe and we say

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
The next version of Photoshop

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Should look like a free to play game

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
And they say

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
We have absolutely no idea what you are talking about

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
But it sounds really bad

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
And what he means by that

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Is that he is saying you know

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
People make money on things like

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Team Fortress

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Team Fortress 2 excuse me that are free to play

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
One steam user apparently making

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
$150,000 a year selling hats

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
In Team Fortress 2

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
So he sort of goes to something like Adobe Photoshop

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
And says what if your platform

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
Was free

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
But you sold the little bits

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
That's at least what I am reading into this

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
You sell the little bits and pieces

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
You sell the advanced filters

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
And all of that

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
How would you feel if Photoshop looked like that?

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
Dark Sakura?

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Well there are other programs that look like that

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
And that's why I don't use them

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Oh really?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Yeah I mean I could use GIMP

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
I love GIMP too

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
But I want what Photoshop does

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
So I use Photoshop

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Let's have real talk for a minute

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Aren't there a lot of people that just pirate Photoshop

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I mean isn't that what

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Isn't that what Newell is kind of

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Trying to get at

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Well people are

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
Pirating it anyway

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
So why don't you just make it free for everybody

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
And then add the features

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Because that's not going to work

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
There's plenty of companies that are still going to

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Buy the official ones for their

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
Designers

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
At a design firm

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
There are plenty of professionals who are going to have licensed copies

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Because they can't produce

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Work for a profit situation

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
If they are using a pirated

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Version

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
They have to have licensing

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Even free to play stuff

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
Sometimes has that pay tier

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Like a lot of MMOs

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Like Star Trek Online or DC Universe or whatever

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Yeah it's free but then if you pay the monthly fee

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
You get your Uber access or whatever

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
Yeah Marisa

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
I would be happy to pay

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
If it was a little more reasonable

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
For those of us who aren't using it under a professional capacity

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Well that's what surprised me about

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
Windows 8

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
The price, you know a lot of people are shocked about

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Windows 8 price but some people

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Infer that that's coming from the Mac side of things

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Where you know I think the latest Mac upgrade

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Was what 20, 30 bucks

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
Don't quote me on that because I don't have a Mac to upgrade

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Right now

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
But yeah a lot of people are saying that

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
Windows 8 is a cheap upgrade because of that

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
So interesting counter move

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I like 7

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
7 does what it needs to do

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
And it

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I just think that

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
And this is the whole reason why more and more

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
People you know basically are leaving

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
The PC and Mac universe to

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Head over to Linux because they want

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
To have the control over what they install

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
In their systems like I love

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Linux because if I want my

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
System to be optimized for graphics

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Over like say sound

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
All I have to do is install a new kernel

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
That's optimized for graphics

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Done

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Or optimized for system speed

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
Done. I can switch between the two

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
If I want to

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
You know I have all of my programs

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I can download them through one place

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
Yes but they've been tested and

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Worked for my system I can still

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
Go through other means to download the programs

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
That I want. I love Linux

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
I'm running Linux Mint right now

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
On my netbook which

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
You know was half the size of the Windows

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Install that came on it

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
And it uses I think

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
A third of the memory resources

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
That Windows does

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
But is it efficient for porn?

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Yes I can watch porn on it

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
He's efficient for porn

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Hey porno box I love you Linux

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
I just got done

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Looking up a bunch of mass effect porn

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I mean

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You mean deviantart research

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Whatever

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
I'm

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I'm doing

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Work

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
If a computer from

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Back in the 90's is efficient for porn

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Which mine was

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
They're slow let's be real

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
A netbook can easily look up porn

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I mean Loki I know you were the kid

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Like me who dialed into all the BBS's

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
To download porn? It took time

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
That was dedication because if that picture

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Because if that picture

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Sucked then oh my god

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
You've just wasted a good like

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
30 minutes

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
And we were thankful back in my day

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Pornography

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Was logging onto the local

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
BBS to see Snow White

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Gangbanged by seven dwarves

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Animated gifs

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
They

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Weren't even animated it was just

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
A regular gif

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
And you what you know what

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
You were lucky if it was in 256

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Colors because look at those boobies

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
In 16 colors and you'll like it

55:08.000 --> 55:18.000
Two miles uphill in the snow

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Go find an old abandonware

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Archive somewhere and download an old

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
School strip poker game from like 1984

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
For what was called

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Now kids I know you might not have heard of this

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
But for what's called a CGA monitor

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Does anybody know

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
What a CGA monitor does

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
And then we had EGA

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Okay I have a dirty

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Porn story

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
My favorite

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Safe for your audience though but it's funny that you mention

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That you know with you know with the

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Internet and internet pornography it's amazing

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Actually how much of a backlog

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And you know things that run on VHS

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
That are on the internet I found out

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
That a friend of mine

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Had a

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
A gentleman had done

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Porn and

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I was there for this this was funny

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
She found out while she was here

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Yeah and um

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
The Wii came out

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Yeah and um

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Now I understand why when we were doing

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
The whole cute little like find out your porn star

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Name game now I understand why he thought that game

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Was so funny

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Now I understand like he didn't

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Yeah well I managed to

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Look it up and uh

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I found it it was like 94

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
I also found out that he hadn't changed his

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Comforter and I had house sat for him once

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
And I was grossed out

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Because they shot it at his house

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Did you run and take a shower immediately?

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Yes

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
He had a chair it was just so comfort

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I slept in the bed I was watching his house

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
And I took a screenshot of his own face

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
And I sent it to all his friends

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Wow

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
That is a cunty thing to do

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Oh my god

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
I'm sorry if that word offends you

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Alright I didn't want to go there

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
That is like drag queen level

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
See you next Tuesday

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
That would be the truth

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
But the problem was Rob

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You sent a picture of his own face to all of his friends

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I had dated him

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
And he did not tell me

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Okay

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I didn't want to

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
I didn't want to have to make that confession

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
But yes

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I have fucked a porn star

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Congratulations

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Yay

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
The things we learned on Orange Lounge Radio

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
In retrospect his technique

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Makes a lot more sense now

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Now I look back

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Oh

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
By technique meaning

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
That he uses the same techniques that butchers use

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
For like tenderizing meats

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Or perhaps that you're like

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Man were you like a butter churner

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
In your past life or something

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I just want to give another hello to the Playstation

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Homers joining us for the first time

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
At the Voice of Geeks Network

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
These are the things geeks have to say

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Who knew? Well you know what

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
There's a comment coming from Playstation Home

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
From Manda Panda 1979

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Snow White banging the seven dwarves

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Hot!

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
It really wasn't that hot

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
But yet we were 13 and loved it

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
One of the days of the pornos he was in

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Was called Country Western Cuties

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Nude pie eating contest

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
And he

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And he

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Bob is on the floor literally

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
He was actually

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
A country singer songwriter

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
That's how I knew him

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Okay for the record

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I had just broken up with my boyfriend

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
It was a very dark time for me

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
And now I

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
So how about video games?

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
That email actually said to all my friends

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Had said I have a present for you

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
And I had the

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Screen cap of Zo face and in

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Porny font it said you're welcome

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
It's a pie eating contest

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I'm

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
So sorry

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Oh yeah and by the way I actually had asked

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
A bunch of my friends to tune in

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
This evening

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Who were not aware of the story

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
So now they know a lot more about me

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Than I never cared to have them know

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
I'm surprised that that's the title of it

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
That's actually pretty

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
You know

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
It's not bad for a porn title

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I mean there's

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
No we're talking like actual pies

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
And not like pies in the

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Pornographic sense

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
That's where my mind went

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I've been literally rolling on the floor laughing

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
So hard

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
You're welcome

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I apologize

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I'd like to take this moment to apologize

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Can we get to the games please?

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Maybe

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Chigurh says

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
That I'm going all Anderson Cooper right now

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Rob was

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Literally on the floor

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
You know what's funny is I had some people

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Come up to you during the game summit thing

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
That we had at our work and everything

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
And they're like hey so I have some libraries

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And stuff that might be interesting in podcast

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And I'm like did you realize this is a pretty adult podcast

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Like we use some colorful languages

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And they're like yeah that's okay

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Are you sure you know what you're getting into?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Well if Catcher in the Rye is at the library

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I mean

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
They're not my customers

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Okay

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Says I'm so glad this is

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
The OLR live I get to

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Come back to after so much time away

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Please don't put this on the wiki

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Somehow

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Windows 8 led to that

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Discussion

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
To register

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Participation for this week's episode of Orange

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Use the passphrase

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Olive

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
So DarkSakura

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Why don't you try to bring us back to games

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Here with another story

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
More porn please

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
No not that

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Square

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Is saying that

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Versus 13

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Is going to still be out

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
And they still are not showing shit about it

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
But they are watching porn

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
No

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
There was basically

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
A statement by

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Yoichi Wada saying that

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Someone was spreading a rumor about Versus being

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Cancelled

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
They said that he just left a regularly scheduled

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Meeting for Versus and quote says

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
If you were to see

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
The city

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Etc presented today

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You wouldn't be able to stand

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
From surprise

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Because everybody thinks the game is dead

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Yeah

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Could it be though I mean okay

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Cancelled but weren't there a lot of

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
You know kind of rumor I mean granted this is

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
All rumors or whatever that it could be a different

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Name now

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I don't know they just said that they're still

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Running it under the luminous engine

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Well I know that's a lot of what we talked about because when the story

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Came up last week we were here but

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We hypothesized

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
It doesn't say anything about it

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Final Fantasy 13 a sequel

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Reborn

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I see what you did there

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
We'll come back to that

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Dark Sakura what do you think of Final Fantasy 13

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Versus does it look like something you play?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Given that I didn't play the first 13 more than

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The level then I kind of

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I'm not interested in it

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Well keep in mind Versus is more Kingdom Hearts ish

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
In the way it plays then I play Kingdom Hearts

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I mean seriously

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I'm kind of spent on the Final Fantasy

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Franchise I kind of don't care

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
About it anymore

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
14 didn't help but we'll get back to that later

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I didn't play 12

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I tried to play 13 and I thought it wasn't

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Great and I'm really not

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Invested in the universe so

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I think honestly between

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
13 and 13

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Versus is pretty much just like

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Joel Schumacher Batman and

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
You know

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
A different Batman Final Fantasy 14

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Was kind of the Batman and Robin of the series

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Right now it's kind of like

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
We had to hire

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Who's like a big

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
We had to hire Steven Spielberg to redo

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Batman and Robin like that's what's going

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
On in Final Fantasy 14 right now

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Alright let's move on with

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Some more news while I get a drink of water

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Because my face still hurts from laughing so hard

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Damn you Marissa this is why

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You haven't been on this show because you kill me

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Every time

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I'm trying to take

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I'm on the Facebook app right now

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I'm trying to take down the leak I sent all my friends

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Inviting them to listen in

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Not all of them knew that

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's okay though it is funny

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I love you so much right now

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I can't even

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Alright so what was his porn star name?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
No

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Everybody's gonna

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Google it now

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Let's move on

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Games, video games, gaming culture

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
That's what we do here at O.L.R.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Alright

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
So let's talk about Ouya

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Ouya is that you know

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Wonderful 99 dollar console that's being

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Created through Kickstarter of course

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
And they made some announcements

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Including that the streaming service

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
OnLive will be coming to the system

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
As well, not a big surprise since

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
OnLive runs on Android and it's an Android

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Device so it makes sense to me

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
That it would be on there

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
But of course OnLive has been

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
They committed that they will deliver a full console class

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Experience and bring hundreds

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Of top tier games for more than

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
80 publishers, more marketing speak

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Marketing speak, marketing speak

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And then of course at the same time

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
They also showed the second half of that

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Concept picture for

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
The Ouya controller and

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah looks like the second half of the controller

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
What do you expect

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And of course everyone's like oh I don't like that d-pad

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Well everything's still not finalized

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
It's just a concept picture

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
But now you have your second half and wow

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It looks like what you thought it would look like

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
The Ouya, the OnLive

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Everything is a really interesting back door

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
To get the big games on

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Ouya because you remember a couple

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Of weeks ago we were you know kind of having our

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Skepticism chat about should we fund

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
This or not and we were talking about

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You know how they're doing this poll to see what

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Games people want on Ouya and it's all this

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
First party stuff is what people really want

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
It's like dude this box is not going to be powerful enough

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
To run you know Mass Effect 3

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Or something like that but

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Thanks to OnLive technology

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
I mean you could play Assassin's Creed

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Or you know whatever the games are

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That are on Ouya

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Borderlands is one of them I know that

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And I don't believe

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
A publisher can say

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
No we don't want our game pushed to

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Such and such I don't think

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Yeah so that is

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I gotta say that's a really

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Smart partnership

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Because you're using a technology

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
That's gonna be able to

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
You're using

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
A technology that your system can accommodate

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
To kind of use those

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Big games and I think that's a

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Really brilliant idea on their part

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Yeah and then of course

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I think we may have mentioned this last week

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
That they're getting the prequel to

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The human element

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Is gonna be an exclusive thing on there

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Considering that that game doesn't come out in 2015

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I don't even know how

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Why would you even announce a game that's gonna come out that far

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
From now I mean

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Cool you got a game coming out in 2015

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I won't remember by the time I get to 2015

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
At live.vognetwork.com

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Who earlier told me they were

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Feeling ignored because of all the

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Attention I'm giving the Playstation home tonight

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I'd love you guys too

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
At the regular chatroom live.vognetwork.com

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Tigerclaw says

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
On live is on Android

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
So it coming to Ouya was a no brainer

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Well if you said that last week

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Tigerclaw you would really look like a

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Games analyst but now

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I mean

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm not surprised because even if

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It wasn't on there they could have easily

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Just you know side loaded it

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
On there and game guru reminds us

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
On live already has

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
A set top box you know so it's

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Already available out there

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
True I think their set top box is like 50 bucks

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Too but at least

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
This you'll get a set top box that'll

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Do that and other

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Things it'd be cool

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
If it's compatible with the on live controllers

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I'm hoping that it's going to be compatible

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
With any bluetooth controller because then

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
I can use my PS3 controller

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Which isn't getting a whole ton of use right now

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Except for

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
You know browsing porn

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
On the PS3

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
What else do we use

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Our devices for alright

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Before I get into the next story I have some

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I'm sorry home this is

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
These comments are a little bit delayed

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
But I think you can tell what segment of the show

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
These comments are from

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
PSV J style

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
In the Playstation home

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Chat room Aurora 1.5 space

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Tonight during summer fest says

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Are you listening to this

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
LOL and

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Fizz Liz says giggle time

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
So apparently

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Now it's the running man and giggle fits

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
In Playstation home summer fest

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Awesome

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Are you going to do the Carlton next?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I don't think the Carlton is one of the

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Dances it might be

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
You know what's great

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Tangent time you ready for a

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Random rob tangent

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
They upgraded the lotus notes system

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
At my work yes my work is one of the few

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
That uses lotus notes as opposed to

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Outlook the other one right

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So we use lotus notes and one of the huge new

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Features is

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Customizable emote icons

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So now when you do the

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Instant message you can have like your own emote icons

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And one of the most popular ones right

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Now that has been passed around

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
At the work place that we send to each other

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Is the Carlton gift

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
When something goes well

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You can add any animated gift

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
To the emote icon system which is amazing

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Please tell me you added the table flipping or something

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
I don't have a table flipping

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But I have a cat jumping out a window

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It looks

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
It's a safe cat don't worry

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
It looks like a great distance but it's not

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's just like jumping into the backyard or something

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But it's funny

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Some things

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Coming to

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I feel bad that on the Sony Playstation home night

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
We have all this Microsoft news but

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
We do have some Sony news coming up a little later

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
But

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
This is an interesting experience on the Xbox

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
360

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
There's some new TV experiences

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Coming later this year

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
They are Connect Sesame Street

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
TV not to be confused

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
With the game that already came out

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
And Connect National Geographic

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
TV which I think they're just calling

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Nat Geo because I guess that's what the hip kids call it

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Nat Geo

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Alright

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
They will be $29.99

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
That's 2400 Microsoft

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Points for 8

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
30 minute episodes

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Apparently they are interactive

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
TV shows though

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
They will be available at retail

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
And Xbox Live under the

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Season Pass

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I don't know how the interactive

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Episode works but I imagine maybe you will like

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Sesame Street like they count along

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
You interact with Connect stuff

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Like Elmo will tell you

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Hey toss me my

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Teddy bear and you make the motion like you're tossing

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The teddy bear and if you don't it will

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Still play on as well

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
It's like optional

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I gotta say if I had kids that

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Does sound pretty rad

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Have you thought about something like this for Josh?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I've definitely thought about it

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I may pick it up

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
How does Nat Geo work?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
You point to

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I want to see the topless natives point

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I think it's animals

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Not topless natives

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It's more like

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Can you spot the

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Giraffe or something like that

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Given a thing you have to find

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I found it right there

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Trivia and stuff like that

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The other thing too is those are also

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Rentable

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I was going to get to that

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
For five bucks

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
That's 400 Microsoft points

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
September 18th is when this all starts

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
That's the purchase

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Renting them is 240 Microsoft points

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Each

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
That might be worth checking out

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
You should definitely put Josh

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
To the test there and see if it happens

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It's hard to say

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
He probably won't know what to do

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
He's still a little young

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
If they tell him jump up and down

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Sing a song

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Sit there and eat a cracker

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
He's like no

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm not going to do that

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Skullking in

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
PlayStation Home says

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Will this Sesame Street game be like Dora the

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Explorer? If so I'm down

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
That's kind of how

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That show works

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
A little bit

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
But it's for real

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Maybe that will be the next thing that comes to connect

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
If these do well

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
It's all about how well these do

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
As iconic as it is

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I imagine it's got to be pretty cheap

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
To reduce

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Since this is all PBS programming

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Fuck Dora the Explorer

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
She's on Nickelodeon

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
You know what it's all about?

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Fucking Carmen Sandiego

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Ghost writer on there

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
No

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
No

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Reading Rainbow

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I want LeVar Burton

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
To read to me on my

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
360 and that sexy sexy voice

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Ah PBS

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Mr. Rogers neighborhood

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I know Mr. Rogers is long gone

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Maybe a live interaction with King Friday

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And what was that lady's

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
name? She was kind of a bitch

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
The lady that had the

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
museum or something, the carousel

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Yeah you lost me

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Somebody with me here, come on

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
That's Sharon Lewis and Bram's elephant show

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
We were listening to the theme song

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
yesterday

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Two elephants went out to

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
play upon a

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
spider's web one day

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
where the hell is my god damn

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Bob Ross painting game that I was promised

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
at the launch of the Wii

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Huh? Please tell me you heard that new

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Bob Ross remix Yeah it was alright

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
It's nice

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Alright

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Lady Elaine, thank you DJ Morpheus

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I knew somebody in chat

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
would know it Lady Jane

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Frisbee gives the full name

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Lady Elaine Fairchild

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
That was it Lady Fairchild

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
She was

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
kind of a bitch

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
What do you want?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
In the land of make believe

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I would give a fuck

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Make believe I'm gonna kick your ass

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I made believe you weren't talking to me

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Hold on sorry dead air but I'm trying to look

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
up right now on

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
the YouTubes

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
If I can get a clip here

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Oh fuck yes here we go

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Oh damn it that's like a song or something

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
That's a creepy puppet is what that is

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It had a picture on it but

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Is she a creepy puppet?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
She was a creepy puppet

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Alright forget it

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Although maybe if that pop song is any good

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I can put that in a vog network rotation

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Anyhow let's move on with some more stories

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Dark Sakura

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Well how

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
about a survival

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
game called Pulse

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
It's free and it was put out

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
by the Vancouver film school

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Well because you know students

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
student work has often played

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
into many a modern video

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
game like

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Portal

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
You know

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Anyway this game called Pulse

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
is a first person survival suspense

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
game so you play as a blind

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
girl who has to go through

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
a cave by throwing around

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
four sprites

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Splat!

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Splat!

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And the sounds

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
they make help her see the world

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
around her kind of you know daredevil like

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
So she has sonar

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
She has sonar by throwing fairies into the wall

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I like that

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And it's done by Pixel

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Pie Team and it's

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
very artsy, colorful

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
cartoony

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
but it's very very grim

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
and actually

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
they want to

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
expand it beyond the free version

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
but for now I think

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
if you want to get it you can go to their

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
official site

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
which is Team Pixel Pie

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
as in 3.14

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
.com

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I'm going to get it when I get home

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Very cool, I'm glad these students

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
had time to produce this you know

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
And the site is really pretty

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I love the color scheme in this

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It really is just very

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
different

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Well congrats to the folks at the very original school

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Well there's another one too

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
There's one called the Mask of Key QI

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
which is a third person platformer

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
that has a master flying squirrel

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
and it's done by

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Team Kronk and it's another

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
freebie

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Alright let's travel around the world

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
and check out release dates of some more

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
traditional retail games coming to a store

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
near you this week. Loki?

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Not a lot of big things but

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
a couple big games that you'll probably be interested in

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
starting off with Risen 2

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Dark Waters on Playstation 3

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Xbox 360

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
and I believe PC

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and then for 3DS owners

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
finally getting your copy of

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
in 3D

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
on 3DS

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
You don't say? Yes I do say

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
and

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think that's pretty much it

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I mean at least those are the big ones this week

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Well the Kingdom Hearts game is kind of a big deal

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
so that's cool

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Yeah that'd be it

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Let's travel- Oh Grow Lancers

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Grow Lancers way far over time

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Forgot the Atlas PSP title

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Alright moving to Japan

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
and checking out the release dates over there

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
The Idolmaster 2 gets a price

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
reduction this week on the Xbox 360

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
That's not a new release but

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
if you like to save money that will be going

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
into effect this week. On the Playstation 3

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
things are a little more exciting

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
when you have Tales of Vesperia also

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
getting a price reduction and

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Tales of Graces F also

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
getting a price reduction and

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Troy Musu getting a

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
price reduction as well as Idolmaster

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
2. There's lots of price reductions. Oh

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Battlefield Bad Company 2

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's like a Playstation 3 sale but

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
sadly no new games to report on either of those

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
systems this week in Japan

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Looking at the Playstation Vita

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
there is a game called Momo

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Daisensu Gen Daiban

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
comes out this week in a regular

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
and premium edition that's a game on

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
the Vita. I don't know if that's

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
based off an anime or what

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
but it's from SystemSoft and

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
it kind of looks like these

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I don't know, one chick kind of looks like an army girl

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
and another kind of looks like Sailor Moon-ish

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
but she's got like a microphone

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
so I'm not sure what this game is all about

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
there is no description

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
about if it's based off a series

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
or what have you. I have to randomly add

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
that Chris always compliments your Japanese

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
pronunciation. He's always

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
impressed by it. Don't listen to early

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
episodes of the show because it was a hot

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
mess. Never had a class

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Well I did have Jamie sitting over here

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
to slap me on the back of the head when I'd get one wrong

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I can't do it right now. You put the embosses

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
in the wrong syllable

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
On the 3DS this

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
week, more exciting

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
games like Smile Pre-Cure

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Let's Go Marching World

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
that's what it's called. Madagascar 3

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
and Wan Nyan

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Dobutsu Buyan 2

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Sorry that's not a Nyan

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
cat game, it just happens to have that in the name

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
but there is a cat and a dog in it

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I think it's like a pet dog

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Wan Nyan

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Midnight Maximum Tune

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
or something like that

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
A crazy drift racing

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Nyan cat

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Starring Tunes is the driving cat

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
This actually looks

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
super cute. It looks like a pet

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
hospital kind of game because the front cover

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
has all this guy

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
and ladies in lab long white

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
coats that you'd see veterinarians wear

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
and it's all kitties and puppies

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and that guy in the back

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Oh my god this is perfect

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Shane if you're listening you need to see this

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Dude in the back with blue hair holding a corgi

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
That's like

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It's Shane personified right there

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I'm going to send him a link to this in case he's listening

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Alright

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Moving on

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I'm sorry I'm busy calibrating

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Who are you? Garris?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Let's do UK releases

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Okay well in the UK

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
I'm going to have to reload the page but on the 30th

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
we have Orcs Must Die

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
and now I have to go back

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
to the top of the page and load it next month

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
So

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
They freaking changed how

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
their things work so whatever

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Um

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Where's fucking August

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Fuck. Okay August

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I can't help it

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Stop judging me

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Okay on August 1st

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Deadlight and Puddle

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
On August 3rd Risen 2

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Dark Waters and then that's all and if there's anything else

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I don't care

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Sorry

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
folks overseas but Dark Soccer doesn't

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
care. No that's all that

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Eurogamer told me there was

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Alright a couple more news stories

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
I couldn't be bothered

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
A couple more news stories for you guys and then

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
the classic game of the week we're going to take a trip down

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
memory lane and revisit a game from the past

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
that you should check out

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
because Dark Soccer told you to

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
but first a couple more news stories

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
In this case because Dan told me to tell you to

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Okay. Alright so apparently GameStop

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
CEO Paul Rains

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
He made a comment regarding

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
the possibility of a used

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
digital

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
downloads

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
format. Basically

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
the whole

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
lawsuit that happened in the UK

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
kind of set an interest

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
well it didn't really set a precedent but it was interesting

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
that they kind of favored

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
towards that that you should be able to get

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
refunds for used games

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
when you're done using them

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Basically calling and saying

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
interesting. It's not a

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
meaningful business yet

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Right now we're not seeing

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
that as a huge market but I think

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
we're on the leading edge. There are a few companies

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
a few startups out there that we

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
talked to that are doing this

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
and of course they just purchased

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Impulse which is

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
originally from Stardock

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
and they kind of have a similar service

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
on there where you can

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
use it as

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
goo to create used

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
PC licenses for different

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
games

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
and they say no we don't see

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
a lot of interest in the model from our publishing

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
partners

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
but definitely something

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
that they're interested in looking at when

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
that time comes. I guess it makes sense

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
if everything is going to go digital and stuff

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
and they do eventually have a

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
way to revoke licenses which would be

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
pretty cool. I mean especially some of the

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
stuff I have on like steam

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
and stuff if I could sell some of the

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
things that you know I'm not playing

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
and I got in some of these indie bundles that would be

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
kind of cool

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
to trade it in for

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
other things

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
but of course you know if it

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
has anything to do with used game sales they're probably

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
all over it. Do you think this could

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
work? It could work but

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
it involves all the

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
publishers having to agree on that kind of thing and that's

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
kind of basically green to

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
having a used marketplace and isn't

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
that what they're kind of trying to get rid of already

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
so that's

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I don't think that this is ever

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
going to

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
hit full force

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
anytime soon. There's a part

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
of me that thinks a system like

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
this is just begging to be hacked

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
like I kind of

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
think they might try to implement well then again

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I don't know steam works alright like

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
they haven't been able to hack steam right

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
but I don't know something like this

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
just seems like

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
it's begging to be worked around

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
there's ways to hack game not that I'm saying

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
you should do it but it definitely is one of the

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
things that's got to be giving publishers pause

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I just think a lot of these systems are

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
going to be closed and then the

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
other thing too is like say I

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
have a PS3 game or something like that and I want

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
to trade my digital copy in for something

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
what if I want to get a 360 game with that

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
or am I going to be able to do that? The system is going to be

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
separate and you have different rules I mean there's a whole

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
lot of things going in

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
going on there and it's just

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
that's probably why this isn't

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
they're trying to get rid of used game sales they're not

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
going to try to all of a sudden say hey

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
yeah we're going to go digital but we're

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
bringing used games back that's not going to happen

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I mean come on they're doing this to get people

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
to buy new games in the first place

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
they're not going to all of a sudden

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
flip a 180 and just say hey

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
by the way used games are awesome

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
no it's not going to happen

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
alright one more story for you guys here

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
before the classic game of the week and it has to do

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
with Final Fantasy 14

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
yes we do want to do a little

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
reporting on Final Fantasy 14 because

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
you know very interesting

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
MMO this is a I mean

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
it wasn't that great when it came out

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
let's be real if you played it on PC especially

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
when it first came out it was a really

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
crap game there have been

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
improvements since it first launched

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
and they're promising even more before

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
the big launch on Playstation 3

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
later this year well they now

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
are officially calling it

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Final Fantasy 14

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
A Realm Reborn that is

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
the version 2.0 of the game

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
that's going to be coming out later this year

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
I don't think it's coming out later this year

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
oh really? yeah

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I have a TBA 2013

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
date right now for it really

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
well they did put out a trailer

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
this week I haven't even watched this

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
trailer yet but I'm told there's no

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
gameplay in it it's just CGI

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
really Final Fantasy trailer no gameplay

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
in it I know right but color me shocked

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
apparently a lot of this has to do

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
with like

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
it's basically Final Fantasy

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
14 Cataclysm to put

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I mean look you can see we're watching

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
the trailer here and you can probably hear a little bit of the audio

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
coming through the feed but we're

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
looking at you know missiles flying from the

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
sky and basically destroying

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
things you see all these like warriors

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
suiting up and putting up shields but it's

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
very obvious the world is being hit

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
so that tells me that's their

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
you know just like they did in World of Warcraft

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
that's their way to

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
change the look of the world and so

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
forth but I gotta say you know

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
the CGI heavy or not

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
it looks great

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
of course the original trailer for 14 looked

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
awesome I remember that original

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
trailer at E3 gave me chills

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
just because I spent so many years with

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Final Fantasy 11 I was like legit that

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
excited and then when I played the game

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I had different type of chills so cold

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
so cold it's so bad

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
why is this allowed to be released

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
he touched me in a dirty place

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
but see that looks pretty rad doesn't it

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I don't know

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I'm just looking here at the end I'm trying to see if there's actually a date

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
nope coming soon

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
I don't have a date coming soon to PlayStation 3

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
and PC December 31st

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
2013 is what the placeholder

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
date is right now which means

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
TVA 2013

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
if it's TVA 2012 then yeah maybe later this year

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Akuma JP

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
says Meteo maybe

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
that's a reference to what you might be seeing

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
there in the trailer very interesting thought

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Monty Boggs says Final Fantasy

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
the new 52

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
in parentheses online players

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
via PlayStation 3

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I see what you did there

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
yeah Akuma JP is putting it

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
together saying there's a red meteor in the sky

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
so he thinks it's gonna involve Meteo

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I gotta say

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Final Fantasy 14 at least the look of it

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
fits in very well with the series

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
it's just kinda you know

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
the game was kinda crap

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Final Fantasy 11

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
a game report into Final Fantasy

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
version 2

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
alright look let's take a step

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
back to a time when games are a lot more simple

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
they weren't so flashy

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
there was no CGI trailer for this game

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
we're about to talk about and if there had been

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
it would have been all kinds of awesome

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Dark Sakura

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
is gonna step into the vault as she always

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
does and she'll go

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
this is crunchy

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
and this will say Dan

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
game

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
and get a classic game of the week

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
suggestion Dark Sakura what is this

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
classic game of the week? Roadblasters

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
good pick

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
yeah I know

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
it's an arcade game that came out by Atari

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
games in 1987

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
when I was still in

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
middle school

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
basically

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
it is a game where you drive

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
a sports car through 50 different

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
rally races and you have to get to the end

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
without running out of fuel

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
so you have to complete all 50 of those

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
races

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
you can basically have as many vehicles

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
as you want to complete the rally

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
but you have to have gas

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
in the arcade

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
the Sega

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
and the Lynx version

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
you could start the game

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
at a higher rally and get more

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
opportunities to jump levels

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
and you can continue the game from where

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
you left off but you only have

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
one chance to complete the 50th and

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
final rally

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
so you have four ways that you can get in this game

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
by green globes, red globes, a checkpoint

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
and the rally point

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
green globes are on the road and they fill

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
your main tank, red globes

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
are getting by shooting enemies

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
on the road and after

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
you complete the rally you get an extra

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
fuel reserve depending on how many

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
enemies you destroyed

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
so you get fuel by blowing shit up

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
each consecutive kill shot increases

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
your multiplier one up to ten

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
and this lowers your multiplier by one

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
so whatever your multiplier

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
is that when you cross the line

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
you get

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
that much fuel

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
so

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
excuse me, I just finished my coffee

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
wow girl, shut up

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
it's your coffee

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
like I said you have

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
a checkpoint, a midway point

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
where

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
when you cross that line you actually get

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
the amount of fuel in the main tank restored

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
to what it was at the beginning of the rally

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
but your reserve

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
tank is not restored so it's just basically

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
like you get a quick

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
fill up, quick fill up

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
so you've got different cars in there, you have the stingers

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
which are orange, command cars

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
which are purple, they have bulletproof bumpers

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
and must be killed by a cruise missile

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
or an electro shield, you have cycles

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
rat jeeps, they come in from the left

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
stop it and swerve to the right, so basically

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
they're like knights in chess

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
gun turrets, you have mines

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
on the road, you cannot destroy

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
them but you get alarms that let you

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
know where they are, and toxic

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
spills, you get special weapons

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
you get the UZ cannon

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
it's a rapid fire gun that does not

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
deplete your multiplier

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
but they have limited ammo, you have a cruise

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
missile which kaboom you get three missiles

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
a nitro inject

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
which increases your speed from 210

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
to 298

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
kilometers per hour

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
electro shield

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
which lets you drive through the enemy

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
unharmed for a short distance and you get three

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
to a pack

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
they wanted

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
though, now this is a little bit of

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
information about the production which actually this little bit

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I did not know

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
the creators wanted to have an electronic

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
version of Mr. Sandman

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
to play on one of the levels

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
but they never put it in

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
that's kind of weird

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
no, this is weird

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
it had a promo with the original arcade game

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
where you can send in your score when all 50 levels

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
are completed to get a free road

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
blasters t-shirt

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
it had a toy tie-in by Matchbox

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
so you get die-cast cars

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
that can be customized with armor

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
lasers, machine guns, rocket launchers

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
and jet engines, there were the

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
turbo force and the motor boards

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
during the gameplay you would get

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
a slightly robotic sounding female voice

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
that gives you advice

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
and it has different phrases

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
including hit it and eat

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
lead road hog

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
and when you use your nitro inject

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
you get, now that's cruising

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
a guy with a last name that I can't pronounce

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I'm guessing it's a Polish name

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Stan Szczepanski

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
holds the

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
official Guinness World Record

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
for roadblaster

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
at 2,216,120 points

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
if you beat this

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
we'll give you some air

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
and that's it, roadblasters

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
alright

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
good classic game of the week, I remember

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
many bowling alley trips to play

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
roadblasters, among other things

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
alright, let me shut up

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
ok, be quiet roadblasters, we're done with you

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
for now, alright

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
we're gonna take a quick break guys

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
we're not done, we're just gonna take a little break

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
to rest ourselves, bathroom break

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
and what have you, more coffee for dark soccer

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
no, break or whatever she might need

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
garris break

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
we will be back though in about 6 minutes

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
or if you're listening to us on the podcast

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
we'll be back in like 6 seconds

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
and of course we got the rapid fire news

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
we've got your phone calls

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
your tweets, your emails

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
and lord knows what else

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
from Marissa

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
in just about 6 minutes

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
here live at the VOG

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
network, the voice of geeks network

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
we'll be back after

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
this with more of Orange Lounge Radio, don't go anywhere

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Radio, the show where every gamer has

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
a voice, we are live here on

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
July the 29th of 2012

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
with the 467th episode of our show

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
already in progress

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
big night tonight

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I was laughing so hard

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
in part A that it hurts, if you have no idea

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
what I'm talking about

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
I guess you'll have to tune in to the podcast later

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
which Marissa will not be plugging on her Facebook

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
just for the record

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
but Marissa is in studio joining us tonight

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
and hopefully above all else

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
having a good time, I hope so

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
not just

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Marissa having a good time with our show

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
but the folks participating in

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
PlayStation Home Summerfest

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
the fan event going on

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
right now, we are in the Aurora

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
1.5 space, but to make sure

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
you're in the right instance

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
you do want to make sure you follow somebody

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
there, I think Home Event Bot

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
is no longer in there if I was looking

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
correctly earlier, but you could

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
follow Black Wolf, he is in

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
there right now, and so

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
am I

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Green Sky with IE

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
at the end, you can follow either one of us

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
into the appropriate event space

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
there, it looks like Tiger Claw is in there as well

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
so hopefully you can follow a friend

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
into PlayStation Home

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
it has thinned out a little bit

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
it is getting later and later on the east coast

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
some people have some other things to do tonight

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
but to all of you that are still there dancing

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
and chatting along there

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
a big thank you to staying up

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
late with us here at the Voice of

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Geeks Network and listening to Orange Lounge Radio

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Black Wolf is in

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
VoG chat and he's

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
in the PlayStation Home space right

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
now saying, they are bubbling me in Home

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
now, I don't want to know what that means

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
what about bubbling somebody

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
isn't it? I don't know

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
is it what the floor was doing?

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
no, the floor makes those pretty effects

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
alright, I'm being told to pick a number

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
between 1 and 100

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
and say it on the air for another

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Blender giveaway, he was awesome enough

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
to give something away during

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
R

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
the letter R will not work

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
he was awesome enough to give something away during the Bobby Black Wolf show

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and he's giving something away now, who knows what it could be

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
but I will let the lovely Marissa

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
she's here tonight, pick that number between

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
1 and 100, Marissa what's it going to be?

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
3

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
3, she's low balling it

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
alright, 1 and 100

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
please don't make any references to balls with me after the first one

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
3

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
balls Marissa?

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Marissa, 3 balls?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
really?

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
alright, 3 it is, that's the magic number

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
good luck, hope it's you

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
I don't know what that's

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
going to pick, but Blender will let us know

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
alright, meanwhile

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
we're going to get back

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
into some rapid fire news

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
and some quick news stories

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
and then the FUGL question of the week

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
and I'll explain that for those that are new to the show

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I do want to once again welcome any new

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
listeners who you might have this week because of Summerfest

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
or whatever, if you don't know Orange Lounge

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Radio, we've been around for 10 years, believe it or not

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
we started the show back in

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
2002, in June

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
of 2002, it was back

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
then, a show we created

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
in support of the

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
music gaming community

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
especially games like Dance Dance Revolution

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Beatmania, Bust a Move

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
or Bust a Groove, depending on what country you're from

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
that whole series

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
everything music game related

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
especially DDR was the big arcade game

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Dark Soccer, Loki and myself

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
all met playing DDR, if you can believe it

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
at a place called Golfland

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
or, you know, sometimes we'd

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
go to the bowling alley, or we'd drive all the way

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
to Stockton, Loki, remember

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
we'd drive all the way to Stockton Golfland

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
to play DDR Fifth Mix when they had that

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
but as the years went on

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
we decided, you know what, yes we love DDR

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
but we love all video games as well

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
and our show became about all video games, especially

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
the community, because the style of our show

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
has always been

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
you know, we would do these arcade

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
nights where we play DDR, and then we'd go

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
to a restaurant called Brookfields

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
a local place here afterwards, and

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
just have dinner and talk shit about things we

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
liked and didn't like, and that's kind of

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
the atmosphere we bring to the show

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
is we literally sit around a big table

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and talk some shit, but you guys get to

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
talk with us in the chat room

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
via Skype, via the mailbag

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
and all of that good stuff

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
and we really do care about what you guys have to say

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
and that's why we call it a show where every gamer

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
has a voice. Anyhow

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
alright, after that little reintroduction

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
just for the folks new to our show tonight

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
let's go to some rapid fire news

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and talk some shit, Loki

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I'm good at that, you know, talking

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
shit and stuff, so let's talk about

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
one of my games that I'm very

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
happy about, Grand Theft Auto 3

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
coming back to the

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Playstation on the Playstation Network

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
has a downloadable title

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
and it will be coming this Tuesday

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
and that is the first

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
of the kind of

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Playstation 2

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Grand Theft Auto games, so pretty awesome

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
it's gonna be 10 bucks, so check that out

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
if you can

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
or if you're like me, just buy the old copy

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
because I have an original Playstation 3

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
rub it in, rub it in, rub it in

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
so I can play my original copy of

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
with hot coffee

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
can't wait, you know what I'm waiting for

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
speaking of Grand Theft Auto, aside from 5

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
where the fuck is Retro City Rampage?

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I want that game now

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
supposed to be this summer

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
question mark

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
and then completely

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
off topic

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I watched some video in 1080p

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
from our Activision rep for

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Black Ops 2, I need that

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
game now

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
that is a sexy game

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
we went and saw, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
because it's not really a game, but we finally went and saw Batman

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
on Tuesday, and they played a

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
trailer for that, they played

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
a video game trailer before the movie, which I thought was

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
interesting, it wasn't like a

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
you know how movie theaters do this now

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I'm sure every movie theater in America does this now

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
like you go to the movie and

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
before the trailer starts, there's just the

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
20 minutes of basically commercials

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
that they call like, what is it, First Look

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
or the 20 or something where it's just

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
it's just commercials

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
get here early and see our

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
ads, yeah you consumer whore

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
and they were

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
showing a trailer for that Modern Warfare 2

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
and Alan

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
leans over to me and goes, this looks bad

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
this doesn't look good, and I'm like

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
it's a shoot em game, honey, you wouldn't like it

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
it's a great game, he doesn't know what he's

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
talking about

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
no seriously, the new one's actually being

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
kind of ties in with Batman because it's being written

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
by the guy that did

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
yes, I was in the ads

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
it looks good, there's some new

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
stuff that they're adding

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
it'll be the first Modern Warfare game

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
that I'm actually going to get at launch

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I'm finally caught up

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
except it's not really Modern Warfare

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
I mean it's Future Warfare

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
anyways, so let's talk a little bit about

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
arcade games, and I actually have

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Double Fish on my arcade cabinet

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I haven't really played a whole ton of it

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
but I have it emulated

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
and it was a game

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
that was on Sammy's

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Autonomous Wave

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Autonomous Wave arcade

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
hardware, they had a lot of other stuff like

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Dolphin Blue and stuff

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
and it was a fighting game, it was pretty awesome

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
well, Dimps

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
the company behind it

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I guess, picked up the rights to it and now

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
they're going to be re-releasing it on

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
consoles

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
not consoles, I'm sorry, arcades

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and they're bringing Rumble Fish 2

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
to arcades

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
which was

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
in 2005, and now it's coming back

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
and I guess

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
it's on this new

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Nesica Live

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
or Nesica Cross Live

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
it's a

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
not a streaming platform, but it's a

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
platform where arcade

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
owners

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
can actually download

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
games to cabinets

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
digital download of arcade games

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I'm surprised

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
that's only just now becoming a thing

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
because that makes an awful lot of sense

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I forgot a shoutout I wanted to do at Start A Part B

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I'm so sorry, this is so important

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I'm so pissed I didn't get to go this year

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I mean, I just, juggling priorities

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
California Extreme

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
was this weekend, and I got

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
sent pictures and video

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
and apparently they had a full on

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, I don't know if it was Chuck E. Cheese

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
but one of the likes, animatronic band

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
that would sit there and creepily play songs

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
cause I got sent a video of one

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
that's awesome, so I mean

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
you never really think of that cause there's a lot of Chuck E. Cheese's

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
that have closed down

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
or just upgraded and stuff

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I hope I didn't get that wrong

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
but it's that style

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I would love to have the old

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Bullwinkles stuff

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
maybe that's what this is, I don't know, anyway

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I'm gonna hand that to Marissa, hit play

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
so that Loki can see it too

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
that way you guys can kind of check that out

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
that's why it was sent from California Extreme

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
and they're singing

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Total Eclipse of the Heart

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
that is pretty amazing

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I was sent

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Neil sent that there

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I would just put that out in my front yard

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
all year round

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
he had a animatronic band

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
it's Halloween, put a fucking

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
pumpkin in front of them

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
it's Christmas, put

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Santa hats on them

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
so shout out to California Extreme

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it this year

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
the shadow casting was this weekend too

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
it would only make that thing better

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
if they would fucking just

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
totally get some

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
brick rolling going on there

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
never gonna give you up

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
oh boy

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
anyway, so we're at

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Rebel Fish

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I think it's pretty cool that they have arcade hardware

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
you can download games for

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
if it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy some

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
arcade hardware I could download games to

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
well, I have arcade hardware I guess I could download games to

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
not entirely legally

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
but you know

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
still, that's a cool idea

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I guess

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
alright

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
and then of course, this is kind of cool

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I know a game that we kind of liked

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
a while back

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Puzzle Quest, they put out a couple games

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
and kind of disappeared

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
but now Puzzle Quest is coming back

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
apparently this is kind of

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
because

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Firemint, the company that

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
put out the game

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I guess they

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
or they just

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Firemint is now

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
putting out the game because they purchased

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Infinite Interactive, which was the original creator of the game

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
and so now it's

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
coming back

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Puzzle Quest 2 is pretty awesome, it was on like every system out there

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and I'm not talking about the galactic one

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
that didn't do so well

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
but Puzzle Quest 2 is really good

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Puzzle Quest is a pretty cool game

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I wasn't a fan of the galactic one but

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
I would be, I'd be down for more

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
of the old Puzzle Quest

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
heck yeah

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
alright I got a few stories for you guys as well

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
or Puzzle Pirates, I'd be down for that too on consoles

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Puzzle Pirates, Puzzle Pirates

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
you can do Puzzle Pirates on Steam

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
for what it's worth, it's free to play MMO right now

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
you didn't know that?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
yeah, it's on Steam

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
yeah, but no one's playing it anymore

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
they will play it if you will play it Logie

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
we will be Puzzle Pirates together

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
alright, I got a couple stories for you guys here

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
first one is about

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Super, or excuse me, New Super Mario

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Brothers 2, did you know I had a

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
working title called New Super Mario

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Brothers Gold, in fact that was

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
supposed to be the name, and you know they've kind of

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
been saying this a lot, this is, even at E3

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
when they were talking about it, what does Mario

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
love more than anything? Gold coins

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
and this new game's all about coins

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
well, apparently

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
it was about

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
excuse me, it was

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
it was so much a part of the game

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
that it was originally going to be

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
called New Super Mario

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Brothers Gold, but

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
yeah, they went back and called it New Super Mario Brothers 2

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
but they were worried too many people would think it's just

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
you know, a cheapy, or a cheap

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
cash-in on the first one

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
of the first one, yeah, but hey, switching

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
out gold and putting two in there, that totally

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
you know, gets rid of the whole

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
thought that it's a cheap cash-in on the first one

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
it's now about, it's all about the coins

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
now, Loki

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
oh yeah, it's all about that, it's totally

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
different than the last game

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
alright, a

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
comment from Crytek is our next story

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
about the Wii U

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
you know, we've been getting more and more developers commenting

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
on this, producer Mike Reed

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
mentioned that

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Crytek is talking about working with

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Nintendo, a version of Crysis 3

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
for Wii U should not

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
be ruled out, he would not

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
confirm if it's in development

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
or not, but it's sounding pretty

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
likely, and here's a quote

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
from ComputerVideoGames.com

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
I wouldn't say there's no chance

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I wouldn't say no chance, I mean the Wii U

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
still doesn't have any kind of release date

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
attached to it at this point, who knows what the

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
future will bring with it, I can definitely say

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
that we are working with Nintendo, and that's about all

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I can say on that front, I wouldn't rule it

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
out, but there really has been no official releases

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
associated with the Wii U yet, and

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
given that we're releasing Crysis in an 8 month

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
time period in February of 2013

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
we can't play off of what their

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
schedules are, I wouldn't rule it out, but you know

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
it's a possibility.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I mean come on, their

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
hardware is pretty much

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
on par with the current consoles, it's

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
not that hard to port that over, I mean

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
they're porting other games over, so

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
yes, of course there's gonna be that

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I think what the stipulation is

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
gonna be, you know, what's Nintendo require

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
from these people putting out stuff

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
for their platform, are they making them

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
hey, you gotta have some unique gameplay that

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
involves their tablet, and

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
them figuring out, well, how are we going

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
to

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
fit this

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
tablet gameplay into

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Crysis 3?

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
One more story about

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
the Nintendo Wii, with no

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
U attached to it,

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
apparently some retailers are out of stock

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
right now on the Wii, GameStop,

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Target apparently reported some of them

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
have the console back ordered,

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
some Best Buys and so forth are just now

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
getting stock in again. Here's the thing

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
though, most people are drawing from

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
this that either Nintendo's about to do a new

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
holiday bundle, so they're trying to get rid of what's on

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
shelves now, or this is

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
in preparation for the Wii U, they

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
might be trying to clean out the old stuff a little bit

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
to make room for the Wii U.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Loki, any insider thoughts

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
from your perspective?

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I haven't seen a lot of demand for the systems,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I would think if they're trying to clear out

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
the stock that they wouldn't be on back order,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
they would be in

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
plentiful supply because they're trying to

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
get rid of them. I don't think that they

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
have a problem with, I don't think Nintendo's sitting

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
on consoles right now,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
it could just be that they're

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
just switching production from

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
you know,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
who knows how long, I'm assuming

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
that they've got to start producing these consoles,

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
so maybe they're starting to switch

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
over some of those manufacturers that are doing

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
the Wii to making the Wii U

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
system instead, just to get prepared.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Before we get to Dark

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Sakura's stories, let me talk

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
some comments from our chat room at

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
live.vognetwork.com

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Tigerclaw says, you know with all those gold coins

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Mario has collected, you think he would use those

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
coins to build a high end security to protect

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Princess Peach?

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Gameguru says, why isn't Wario the villain here?

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
He loves coins.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
And we have an update from Bobby Blackwolf at

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
PlayStation Home Summerfest, going on right

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
now in Aurora 1.5 space,

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
saying that the random

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
number contest ended up being

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
that you had to use the random number

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
action, and whoever hit 3,

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Marissa's number first, won a

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
gift from the Lockwood gift machine, and

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
the winner was GTIVW1975.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So congrats!

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
A clap for you.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Golf clap.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Golf clap. Golf clap.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Alright.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Let's move on, Dark Sakura.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
Well we have a few goodies.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
What we have is Little Big Planet 2

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
getting Disney Princess

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
edition, where they all look

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
kind of bizarre.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But I think everything in Little Big Planet

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
looks bizarre. So there's two different

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
DLC packs. One of them, like I said,

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
is the Disney Princesses.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
The costume pack one has

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Aurora, Cinderella, Jasmine, and Snow White.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And then the second one is Belle,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Tiana, Rapunzel, and

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Ariel. Yay.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Then,

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
we have some information

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
about Dance Central 3.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
We have

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
the songs

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
that are going to be out on it.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
As some of these people

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I really do not know who they are.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I'm assuming some of them I do.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
To anyone, whoever the fuck that is,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I am the best. We have Alice DJ,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Better Off Alone, fucking love that song.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Backstreet Boys,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
JJ Fad,

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Lil Jon,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Eastside Boys featuring Nyan Nyan Twins,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
whatever.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
LMFAO, Lost Del Rio,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
we have

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Maroon 5 with moves like Jagger.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
I actually really like that song.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
We have Ice Ice Baby.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
We have Vicky Sue Robinson,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Turn the Beat Around, and Village People

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
YMCA.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Whatever happened to Alice DJ?

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
That was like my college

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
years right there. Alice DJ is Better Off Alone.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Apparently.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And then, last but

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
never least, the Nintendo 3DS

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
XL UK

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
price.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
This is going to be $179.99.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Again, that's in

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
pounds.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Tesco's, however, will be offering

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
the device for

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
£175.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
So, you want it cheap, get it at

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Tesco's.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Game, one more,

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
has a trade-in deal that for $79.99

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
you can trade in an old boxed

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
3DS and

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
get the 3DS XL.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So that's it.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Alright.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Moving on, we have a segment

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
we always do here on Orange Lawns Radio

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
called the Fugal Question of the Week.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
You might be asking yourself,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
what the hell is a Fugal?

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Put Facebook

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
and Google Plus together

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
and you get Fugal. That is what it is.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
We ask a question each week in our Facebook

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
and Google Plus communities

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
and you guys answer it. Here's this week's question.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
There's a couple betas

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
going on right now, including Guild Wars 2,

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Little Big Planet Karting, and

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Sony PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
just to name a few. Have you

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
ever made a decision whether or not

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
to buy a game based off the beta?

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Considering that betas are

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
unfinished products, do you think that

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
it was a fair decision

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
or should a company not put it out there

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
if it's not ready to be judged?

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
I thought it was a good question

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
not just because I thought of it.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
So let's get to some of these comments

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
here. I want to

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
start with Google

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Plus tonight.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And yes, there are people posting on Google Plus.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
My quick impression of Google Plus.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Hello! Hello!

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
No, we have

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
two comments from Google Plus

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
tonight. There's

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
at least two people using Google Plus.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Some weeks we get four.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
All right, Reddertainment says

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
no, but I did buy

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
cakes prolonging the magic after

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
listening to Alpha Beta Parking Lot,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
which I...is he plugging something?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I don't know what the...

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
had nothing to do with the question, sir.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
However, Flaco Jones responded

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
saying, I knew after playing all the

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
starting areas in the Final Fantasy 14 beta

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
that it wasn't worth buying.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I do think that was a fair decision

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
since the game came out a month later

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
and was reportedly as bad as the beta

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
was. Yeah, that was

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
a beta that ended up being pretty accurate

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
I gotta say. Good reminder

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Flaco Jones.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Going to Facebook for some of the comments from Facebook.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Amanda, Amanda R says

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I've played in betas that were out only

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
a couple weeks before game release

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and by this time, these are mostly

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
finished products with only minor tweaks

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
being made. I have made the decision

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
to not buy a game when it came out because

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
the beta was just not fun and with

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
that close to the release, not

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
enough changes were going to be made to change the game

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
in any significant way.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Cody T says, I've played betas of

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
a million games and I think I've bought

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
most. I think betas are more for the

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
developer than for the consumer. It's a cheap

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
way to see exactly what is wrong with the game

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
by the best judge, us.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
And it's a way for the gamer to be involved in the actual

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
development of the game.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Nick M. responds

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
saying, I believe a public or

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
large closed beta is the only responsible

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
decision for game companies if their game

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
relies heavily on multiplayer

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
due to the large number of, excuse me

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
large amount of problems that will often

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
otherwise show their head on launch day.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
However, more often than not, betas

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
talk me out of buying games that I'm already

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
on the fence about.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Boschka responded

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
and said, yes, the only game

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I have ever done it for is a game that's

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
actually free when it comes out.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Path of Exile. Think Diablo 2 and new features

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
and updated graphics. I donated

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
$10 not only to get a second beta

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
key for a friend, but because I love

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
what they're doing with that game. If I could get more

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
I would. Blizzard just take some

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
notes on how to make a good action RPG.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Ooh, sick burn.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
I think it's fair. People

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
have to learn what a beta is for. It's not

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
a demo. You're testing buggy code.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
You're testing builds that are normally

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
four to five builds behind what the devs

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
have. Some games basically require

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
betas based on the sheer size. For example,

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
in the Mists of Pandaria beta

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
they changed one ability for a

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
boss fight and the next thing you know there's an

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
elevator coming out of the ground on another continent.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
If the company says before

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
that it's not a demo, it's a beta, I think

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
that is completely fair. If you don't get the

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
difference, you're not the type of tester they want anyway.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
A long but good comment from

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Boschka.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Let's see.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Wicked says, I believe betas are an

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
integral part of games development.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
It gives the fan base an inside look at

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
what is to come and also gives

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
the developers instant public feedback to

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
work out any bugs the game may have.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
However, game companies should be wary

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
about using open betas as it sometimes

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
gives the gaming community expectations

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
they may not have had before, positive

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
or negative.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Sometimes the game does not live up to the

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
over-hype that sometimes follows certain

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
open betas or some good games

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
could easily be overlooked due to

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
negative reactions to betas. So

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
while betas can easily help a game's

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
development, it could easily skew the game's

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
anticipation in the public eye.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
And lastly, Chiggers

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
responds saying, I've bought games based on

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
the demos. Does that count?

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Kind of. Demos

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
are a little different than betas. I think

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
kind of going back to the other points, like betas

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
are put out there

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
because they're not supposed to be demos. They're

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
supposed to be tests for the developers. But

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
kind of where I was trying to go with the question

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
is that a lot of people look at betas as

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
demos in this day and age. Is that fair?

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Or should the developers be real

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
and realize that's how most people

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
are going to view it? Anyhow,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
thanks for all those answers on Facebook at

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I didn't read them all

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
so please go check out the post to read

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
some of the other great insights from

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
this week. Really appreciate it guys. Sorry

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
I couldn't read them all, but it's only

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
a three hour show.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Alright.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Oh, by the way, XLink

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
giving me the update in our chat

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
room at live dot vog network dot com.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Here's what happened to Alice DJ.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Quote,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
after the group went their

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
separate ways, Prank decided

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
to move on to other ventures by putting her

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
music career aside to become a makeup

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
artist and beauty fashion consultant.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I remember

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
the video. She was a

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
very hip looking gal. I remember

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
that. They actually had like two

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
videos for that song, Better Off Alone.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Anyhow, well, I learned something

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
tonight about Alice DJ. Who knew?

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I've learned about pornography

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
and I've learned about Alice DJ. Who

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
knew? Marissa's

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
hiding her head. This is adorable.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Loki,

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
what do you got for us next in

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
other gaming news?

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Alright, so let's talk a little

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
bit about

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
you know, rock band. And this is kind of funny

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
because I don't know

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
if you guys remember, a couple months back we had a

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
scare where, hey, guess what?

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
You know rock band that you purchased

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
on IOS and stuff like that?

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
It's being delisted. It's being taken away.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
And you know that game you just

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
purchased? Well, now it's going to be completely useless

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
because you're not going to

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
be able to get anything anymore for it.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
It's just, it's going to be gone.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Well, and you may remember

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
that they came out and said, oh, no, no, no.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
That's not happening. That message was

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
sent in error. Well, the error was that

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
it was sent two months early.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Because now, yes, they are actually

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
delisting the game.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Well, I don't think people were mad

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
that the game was being delisted. I mean,

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
whatever. People are pissed if it wouldn't

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
work anymore. That was the

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
original, like, scare campaign going around is that

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
haha, you just bought this game and none of

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
your DLC or anything is going to work anymore.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
LOL, bye. You know,

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
but that doesn't appear to be the case. I mean,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
if they're just pulling it from the store, then whatever.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Well, they're pulling basically the

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
rock band, um, IOS game

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
and rock band reloaded IOS game

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
and all the, um, I think

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
all the DLC for it as well.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Yes, you will not be able

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
to purchase any more DLC for it.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
So,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
and that's supposed to happen effective

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
July 31st.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
So, a couple days from now.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Well, yeah.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
As a musician, like,

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
yeah, um,

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
which, I'm sorry,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I'm actually just being unemployed.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
But,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
with regard to the, um,

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
the music games, it's actually, especially

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
guitar players, like, games like Guitar Hero,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
especially at the time, it was at its height,

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
really enraged.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
You know, musicians, they got so angry,

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
especially since a lot of people were misinformed

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
and they, you know, you,

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I even heard a lot of people

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
ignorantly at GameStop believing that it could teach

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
you how to play guitar. However,

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
um, I ended up, um,

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
my friend's mother ended up winning a free copy

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
of Rocksmith, so we played it.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And, um, that was actually one where you, uh,

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
they gave you, you know, an XLR cable, and you actually,

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
you could actually plug in your guitar to the Xbox.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
And that actually was a pretty good game, and then

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
actually, I mean, you plug in your own guitar to it, and that actually,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
um, I had

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
guitar players play it, and they actually found it challenging

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and interesting, and it actually, you know,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
accurately, you know, presented theory and things like that.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
You know, I'm glad you said that.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And you don't, you didn't

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
know this before you said that, but I usually have to

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
refrain from comment on that game, because

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
a really good friend of mine knows somebody

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
that's a big part of the development of that

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
game, so I usually don't try

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
to avoid the topic on the show because of

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
conflict, but, uh, I'm glad you said that.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I'm sure that'll make somebody very happy to know that.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Yeah, I didn't get that far into

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
the game, but I mean, I enjoyed it, and I think

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
that, um, you know,

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
it's not gonna turn you into a virtuoso,

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
but I mean, um, you know,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
if you're too cheap to go, to go get lessons

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
immediately, it's a good place to start, just to get, like,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
a very basic foundation, and it's fun.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Yeah, I understand that game does

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
have kind of quite a bit of, like, a cultish

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
audience, I don't know what it sounds like, but, like,

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
a lot of the makeup of, I

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
think, who's into that game is kind of like people

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
who are rediscovering

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
getting into music maybe at a later age.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Like, it's not like kids and teenagers

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
and so forth playing it that rock band

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
tends to skew towards, like college parties and stuff,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
but, like, Rocksmith is, like, 30-somethings

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
who always wanted to learn to play

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
an instrument that never did.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
I wish that they had, um, I guess it didn't be

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
That's my impression, it's not, like, just my impression of it.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
I, um, I guess it didn't, you know,

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
my understanding is, you know, it didn't

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
blow up, necessarily, but, I mean, I wish

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
that they had a, um,

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
a wider, um, library

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
of music, you know, it started to when it came

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
out, they started releasing stuff all the time, but I wish it had

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
more, you know, but, you know, that's just selfishly

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
excited, you know, it'd be fun to play.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Well, they do DLC pretty regularly.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
And you're in luck, because they have Rocksmith

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
and Bass, or Guitar and

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Bass coming out, uh, this October.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
You don't need a game

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
You don't need a game to teach you bass, no.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I'm kidding.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I'm kidding, actually.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
It does require

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
talent. Just not a lot.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
You don't have to be a

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
retarded monkey.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
No, actually, though, I have friends like

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Freebo. I have friends who are excellent bass players.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
And all the running musicians joke, making fun of

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
bass players. Good times,

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
good times.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
It's just, are you a fan of Green Day?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Like, I like Green Day,

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
but let's be real, a lot of their songs are kind of like

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
the same chord over and over, and it cracked

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
me up, because he was sitting there, he's

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
gonna be the guy that's lead singer in the band

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
is gonna be one of the, not like a judge,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
but like a mentor or something on The Voice.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
But he's working with Christina

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Aguilera. And I don't know why,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
but I found that to be like the funniest thing I'd heard

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
all week. Okay. You're not gonna

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
appreciate this, but any other

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
musicians listening to this

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
and the

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
band that now

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
knows my embarrassing past that I've told

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
to tune into will appreciate this.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Green Day is

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
kind of like the Creedence Clearwater

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
of their time.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
I know that sounds obtuse,

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
but there's always this joke that like

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Creedence Clearwater songs and John Fogerty's songs

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
only require three chords to play.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
And that is essentially, I mean, there is

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
something to be said about, you know, Green Day's later

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
artistic merit, you know, and there are things

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
to be appreciated about it, but

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
do I think that they should be

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
held in that high of a regard?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
No. Well, I'm not a member

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
of the cult though, you know.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I appreciate some of the things that they've done,

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
but I'm not a cult member or anything.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
You know, and it's amazing where they've come, you know,

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
singing songs about acne and masturbation

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
to

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
guitars that were out of tune.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
To like commentary on President Bush and so

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
forth, and that Broadway play.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
They've come so, oh god.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Rissa, you alright over there?

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I feel like, you know, like

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Green Day songs with, you know,

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Fosse moves.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Uh,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Stan in our chat rooms, you are

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
spurring some music discussion in our chat rooms.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Stan says, same with Hansen.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Bop is only three chords.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
They didn't even have three hits.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
They had like 30

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
babies between them all though.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
The girl in Hansen's

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
pretty cute.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
No, they're actually all from evangelicals.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
That means Justin Bieber

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
is like the Hansen of our

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
time, basically.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Justin Bieber has his own video game now too.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Oh god, I hope not.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
People don't understand. Teenage girls

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
are stupid. I said this is

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
a former teenage girl.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
As one who was once

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
a teenage girl. I was there, I was there.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
I have authority on this subject.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
I do. I mean, granted,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I never had bop posters on my wall

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
or anything. No, no, no, no, no, dear.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
This is what you get for being younger than me.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
I had new kids on the block.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Everyone can shut up.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I was, the kids

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
in my school called Victoria.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
So,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
so I was very much the

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
anti that, but the thing that people don't get

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
about this, and of course, yes, it's interesting

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
how the media will exploit everything when it comes

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
to a tween star like this, including

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
the areas of video games and apps

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
and all this crap, but it's just

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
just, they just

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
found a boy to fill

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
the slot of cute teenage boys

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
singing songs to seduce, it could

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
have been anyone, you know. They just,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
you just put him in the spot and they put the marketing

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
movement behind him and done.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
It could have been anybody. It had nothing to do with

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
who Justin Bieber is. Nothing.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Sorry. It fascinates me at what musicians

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
get movies, too.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Like, Justin Bieber

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
gets his movie at like the Megaplex and so forth

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
and then fucking Katy Perry

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
has this big,

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
uh oh, uh oh.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
I just opened Pandora's box.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
If Katy Perry

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
gets her own movie,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I should have, you know,

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
my own, you know, like quadruple

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
sequel and then mini

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
series and TV shows.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Let's face it, she got the movie

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
because of her titties, okay?

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I mean, she has some cute

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
songs, blah, blah, blah, but mainly it's because

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
she's beautiful, you know, and people

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
like talking about her boobies, apparently.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
So, that's why she- And Elmo.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
So, I deserve my own series.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
You should be a Star Trek next to that.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
You should be like four TV

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
series, what is it, like

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
nine movies and fanfic.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
If her movies alone get her

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
a movie, I deserve so much more.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
But then, here's

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
what fascinates me, like, yeah,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Katy Perry has some catchy songs, whatever.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
When you're drunk at a gay bar, you

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
don't care. Oh, Katy Perry, I love her!

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
You know? She's a big marketing team

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
too. But, I mean, she's kind of a tool.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
But then, you have, like,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
LCD sound system had, like,

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
their big, you know, farewell thing and all that

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
and like, what did they get? They got

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
like, they got a Fathom event.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
They got like, their movies

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
like one night only at the local

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
cinema.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Life is not fair. Before the Metropolitan

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Opera, you know, movie theater

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
night, you know?

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Poor guys. Alright.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Anyhow.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
ActDeft in our chatroom says, Marissa

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
the movie 2, electit boobaloo.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
That should be the name of your next album.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Alright, moving

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
on.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
That's how Katy Perry sells shit, I can do it too.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
You just,

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
you gotta get out of the little affair

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
and get into the pop music.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
All I need is some vocorder and some autotune.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Just whine about a boy who broke up with you

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
years ago or something, you know?

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Just sing about Dave Coulier.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
You know?

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Insult the women that actually are gay

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
and can't help it and pretend to be a lesbian

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and, you know, to amuse men.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
It's great. Get in a

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
pillow fight, braid somebody's hair.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Oh my god!

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Free someone's bra. We used to do

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
that dip of bra and orange juice and put it in the freezer

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
for the first girl who fell asleep.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
Yes.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
That's hot. Keep talking. Alright.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Moving on.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Okay, this is bad.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Because we're going to go from such humorous, happy

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
discussions to really unfortunate

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
situations.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
I'm about to Debbie

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Downer the show a little bit.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And talk about some layoffs.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Stop laughing, Marissa.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Stop laughing, Marissa. Inappropriate.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
No, this news really does

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
suck. Maybe we should skip

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
this story.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Read it already.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
We need variety.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Uh oh, Marissa's choking.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Alright.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Serious face.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
Microsoft laid off a

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
small, as they put it, number of positions

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
at their Vancouver based development

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
studio. This is because Project

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Columbia, whatever this was, we

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
don't know what the real name was, it got

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
cancelled. It's off the

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
books now. It was supposed to be an educational

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Connect title. It was going to educate

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
young people. It was going to pair books with

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
music and illustrations. I guess

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
it had something to do with the Sesame

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Workshop as well. That doesn't necessarily

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
mean it was a Sesame Street game. But it

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
sounds like it was something that was kind of geared towards kids.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Or the like.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Wonder Book Connect.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
And then they saw the Wonder Book presentation like, wow.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
That looks like shit.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
And then they're like, woo. Scrap that.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Perhaps. But layoffs are

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
never good news. Especially

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
also when they hit Warner Brothers. Seattle

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
also had some layoffs hit them this

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
week. They were currently working on

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Lord of the Rings Guardians of Middle Earth.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
And if you might be thinking to yourself, God, they're

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
still making Lord of the Rings games? Well,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
there's a Hobbit movie coming out at the end of the year. You might have

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
heard of it. It's a big deal. So yeah.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Moolah moolah. Unfortunately,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
not enough moolah, apparently.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Layoffs hit the studio once back in

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
November that was supposed to be 60 people.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
And a statement from WB

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
says, quote, due to shifting business

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
imperatives, Warner Brothers Game

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Seattle has made staff reductions. The

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
group will continue to remain an integral part of

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Yikes. Now,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
since I would like to end with a little bit of a positive,

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
id Software,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
id Software, you know,

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
they made like Doom and shit.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
They are actually hiring

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
right now. They are

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
hiring on their website for a

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
UI programmer job for, quote,

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
an unannounced game on future

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
generation consoles.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
So could it be something that

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
is a sequel to one of the past

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
franchises? Possibly, because the listing

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
actually says, quote, familiarity with

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
id Software games, characters, brands,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
and universes. So who knows?

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
It could be a new Quake. It could be a sequel

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
to Rage. It could be a game with

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Space Marines versus either

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
demons or

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
aliens. It could be Commander Keen

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
6 or 7 or

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
whatever they're on now for all we know. So

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
there you go. Anyhow,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
that's it for

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
that story. Let's move on. Dark

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Soccer. Okay, well, in other

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
news, how about

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
something about that PlayStation

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
All-Stars crap that's coming out?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Oh, you think it's crap?

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I don't know.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
We're gonna, actually, we're gonna have Beta, somebody

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
we know very well has been in the Beta.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
We're gonna have Beta impressions in a little bit.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Well, I'm not necessarily going to call it

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
crap. I'm gonna call it potential crap.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
So, um,

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
there are some, uh,

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
people who have gone through the data

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
files for PlayStation All-Stars Battle

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Royale and has nine

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
stages, eight characters, and a bunch of other

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
stuff. So what we have

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
is a Bioshock Infinite stage,

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
um, Sir Daniel

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
is it Fortesca Fortescue

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
from Medieval?

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Dante from Devil May Cry, Spike

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
from Ape Escape, Raiden from Metal Gear Solid,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
um, Nariko

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
from, uh, Heavenly Sword,

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
and, um,

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
we've got David Hayter saying he's

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
recording dialogue.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
So, and he's, um, sorry,

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
he's Snake, so.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
I believe all the characters that you

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
mentioned, but they're new characters that haven't been

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
released yet. Well, yeah. Well, I'm gonna go through the whole list.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
This is the, the new stuff, okay?

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
We have Dante, Evil Cole,

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
um, Nariko, Raiden, Sackboy,

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Ratchet and Clank, Sir Daniel

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Fortescue, and Spike.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
And then for items,

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
there's an Atomizer,

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
the Balmusu Axe,

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Boots of Hermes,

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Freeze Missile, Golf Club

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
from Hot Shots Golf, Gravity Shield

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
from Wipeout, Hedgehog, um,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Grenade, uh, the Dovat

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Leech Beam, Murder of Crows

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Railgun, Razor Claws,

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
RPG, Scythe, Spear,

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Sonic Rift, and Sackbot.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
And then, supporting

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
characters, as in minions, Captain

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Quark, Kai from Heavenly

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Sword, Kat from Devil May Cry, Kia,

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Monkey from Ape Escape,

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Nyx, Pierre from

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Doko Demolisho, um,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Sackbot, and Sam

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
from Metal Gear Rising.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
And then it says, there's, like, just a bunch

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
of modes, but as far as stage goes,

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Alden's Tower, Black Rock Stadium,

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Columbia,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
uh, Franzia from Locoroco,

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
that actually looks pretty neat. Um,

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Is it Franzia boxed wine as well?

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
No, that's Franzia. This is

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Franzia. Well, my bad.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Marissa's, Marissa and I

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
think alike. Paris, tip it!

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Tip it, Kathleen, tip it!

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
We think, like, old 50-year-old. I'm sorry, I think of

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Kathleen Griffin.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
I do too. I have San Francisco from

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Resistance, um, Stillaways from Uncharted,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Time Station from Ape Escape.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
So, yeah, I'm most excited about Locoroco

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
stage, really.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And all these were from, hacked from files

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
from the beta. Yes.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Hackers gonna hack! Exactly!

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
People should know that by now.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Hack like what? I'm looking forward

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
to playing as Parappa. I think the

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
game looks fun. Yeah.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I, I heard, I'll let the,

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
the person who's gonna review the beta in a minute here,

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
which we just talked about, you shouldn't

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
do that, but hey! And that is, I believe,

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
against the, uh, end-user license

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
agreement, or the, uh, was it the, um,

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
confidentiality agreement?

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
This... We ain't the

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
ones gonna get sued out for it!

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Ain't our asses! It's not me! It's not me

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
playing it! I got a special tipster.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
We'll, we'll break out the,

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
the voice, uh,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
disguiser, and the shadow,

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
everything for, so they aren't

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
identified. Well, tech,

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
this person's using someone else's beta.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
So, it's even, like,

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I know, right? A woo-woo!

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Anyhow.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Um,

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
moving on. Loki.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I wish I was in a

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
beta test for that game.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Looks awesome. I try,

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
I was like, give me, give me the logon

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
and password so I can get into.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Um,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
so there was a hack that was, um,

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
demonstrated by a Russian hacker,

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
uh,

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
using, uh,

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
basically a way to spoof the

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
iOS, or the Apple Store,

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
um, servers

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
to allow him to make

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
free in-app purchases.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Pretty much, um, they say,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
uh, you know, he

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
enabled, I guess, 8.4 million

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
fake in-app purchases.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Over 115 games were affected,

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
including, um, you know,

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
all the big stuff, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja,

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Infinity Blade, Plants vs. Zombies,

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
uh, that kind of stuff. And,

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
um, apparently, Apple, though,

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
is, of course, gonna fix this. They say

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
the fix will check whether in-app

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
downloads were valid, and

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
fake purchases will be wiped from the

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
device. In other words,

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
it's gonna slow everything down.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
So, thank you

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
for ruining it for everybody. Appreciate that.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Of course, you know, um, it's gonna require

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
that, you know, these people that publish

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
these apps are gonna need to update, um,

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
their apps with a new API for it.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Um,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I don't know how they're gonna, how's that

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
really gonna work? Like, say, for example, I

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
use that glitch or whatever,

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
or that exploit to purchase

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
a bunch of tower bucks or something in

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Tiny Tower, and then I spend

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
all of them. How are you gonna take

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
that away? I mean,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
I don't see how it's gonna work. I don't

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
think you can at that point. I don't think

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
for consumables like that, I don't think you can

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
actually do anything. I see, like,

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
okay, if I purchase, you know,

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
songs from Rock Band or something like that,

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
make sure that I actually purchase those

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
and then go from there,

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
but...

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Maybe the game could break?

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Like, if it takes you into negative tower bucks

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
or whatever, it just says, fuck you,

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I'm out. Then the game stops

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
working or something. I don't know.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
From what I'm aware, though, the hacker, I don't think

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
has released, um, the method

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
of how that's done, although

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
it's just being done, like, um,

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
somehow, I guess, he just spoofed

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
the, um, response from those

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
servers. Very interesting.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Hmm.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Alright, well, moving on to a different topic, this

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
has to do with Sonic and All-Stars

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
Racing Transformed. This is that Sonic

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
game that has all the really interesting characters,

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
like Danica Patrick is, like, a playable

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
character, and then we talked to Wreck-It Ralph,

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
uh, last week. Well, um,

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
apparently, there is, uh, an interesting comment

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
that was made this week. Uh, this was

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
by the digital, or, excuse me,

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
the executive producer, Steve

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Lysette, who's with Sumo Digital.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Uh, he's basically implying that the

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
characters could be different

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
depending on which platform you purchased the game

02:15:50.000 --> 02:16:18.000
on.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Why is this? Well, some platforms

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
have characters that are unique to that platform.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
I'm not gonna say which, that's part

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
of the fun of the reveals. Some are

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Sega characters, some are not.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Don't bother asking.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
This has a lot of people speculating

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
that maybe the Wreck-It Ralph

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
will end up being a Nintendo exclusive

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
guy because of all

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
those, you know, stories about how

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
the Nintendo characters are the ones in the movie,

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
and apparently, the Wreck-It Ralph

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
official game is only gonna be on the Nintendo

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
consoles. It's kind of leading people down

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
those lines. We won't really know until

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
the rosters are revealed for all three platforms,

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
but, interesting speculation.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
And I believe the reason why,

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
uh, well, the reason why it's

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
exclusive on the Nintendo platforms is also

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
they're kicking in some money for marketing as

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
well, um, for the Activision

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
game, so, it makes sense.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
It does, it does.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Alright, well, let's

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
take a look at our

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
mailbag.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Music

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
mailbag head first and reads a few emails

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
for you. Mailbag at

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Now, Dark Sakura, when you weren't here last week,

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
there was, like, eight emails sent to the show.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
So, we only read half of them,

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
and we saved the other half for you. Well, there's

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
three that I saw.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
These might be the leftovers from last week, I know.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Well, this is July 22nd, so.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Um, greetings, OLR.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle. I just wanted to

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
share how much I love Steam sales, and boo

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
to Origin. As someone

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
who doesn't need many games on

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
release days, I always wait for the

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Steam sales. I can't wait for this holiday.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
If you want, please share the damage

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
that Steam did, um, to each of you.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Your loyal turtle and Philly series turtle.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
And I think I just bought, uh,

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Borderlands, that's all. We ended up, uh, actually

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
talking about the Steam sale last week a little bit,

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
so I'll, uh, kind of point you back

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
to that show, but Dark Sakura, that was the only

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
damage they did to you, was Borderlands?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Yeah, pretty much. Oh, we'll have to play together sometime.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I have to actually install it.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Marissa, you ever use Steam? I know you're not,

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
you're not a huge, huge gamer girl, but you,

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
you like the adventure games. I gotta say, Steam is

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
a good place to look for some of the newer stuff,

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
if you're into adventure games. I don't know.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I have not, but I probably should, because I have had

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
the same recommendation as well. Yeah, because some

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
of that stuff goes on sale, like, dirt cheap

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
sometimes, and it's like, if you, they actually

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
have a Lucas Arts pack. I

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
don't, something's missing from it, it was just

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
probably, oh yeah, Maniac Mansion, because that was the Game of the Week

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
last, or the Maniac Mansion sequel

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
was the Game of the Week last week, and,

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
um, because we let Alan pick when you were out, and he

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
picked the Day of the Tentacle, and that was one of the

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Lucas Arts games that's missing from that pack.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
But you can get, I think it has, like,

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Loom and some of the other things that Dark Sakura's picked

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
in the past. That's one of the big things on there,

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
so, yeah, pretty cool.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Alright.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Oh, yes, next email.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Um, the theme,

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
the subject is Garris.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
And it starts off, Garris.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Hello sentient creatures. There is a media

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
event that I'm sure you are aware of. This is something

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
that people have been eagerly anticipating,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
and have been looking forward to

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
for a while. I'm also sure that many of us

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
out there saw this media event.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
However, there are some of us who haven't seen

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
the media event, or have

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
yet to see this media event in

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
its entirety. It is for this reason

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
that I email you today. Please, for the

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
sake of all of us who haven't seen it, please don't spoil

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
the British Open. Stay black,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
redertainment, Garris.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Or the Olympics. I think the joke

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
might have been Batman, Dark Knight Rises.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I saw it.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
It wasn't bad.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
It had some really slow parts,

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
though. It did have some slow parts,

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
but I was okay with it in the scope of the

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
big picture. I'm not gonna spoil.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I'm not gonna do that to you guys. I have one question

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
from that movie. What? Why did Bane

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
sound Belgian?

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Is it just me, or did he sound Belgian?

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I do not think you should talk about

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
his voice in a negative manner.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
He sounded like Count von Count to me.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
He sounded Belgian.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
He sounded...

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
With that same pleasant

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Belgian... I liked his

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
voice, even if it was a little silly.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
He sounded very pleasant. I'm glad

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
they changed it from that trailer, though.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Like in the trailer, Bane sounded

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
like this.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Okay, Tom Hardy.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Tom Hardy is...

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
I'm just saying this.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
As your resident gay gamer,

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I'm just putting this out there. Tom Hardy

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
is so fucking hot. Like, I can't

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
even. I can't even.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
He's no Bruce

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Campbell, I'm sorry.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
He wasn't that hot as Bane.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Oh, the movie. The movie, can I just say?

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
It wasn't as good as the last

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
one. I didn't say the last one. The Dark Knight

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
will probably be the best comic book

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
movie they ever freakin' make.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
But, I honestly

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
think Dark Knight was better than Avengers. Don't get me wrong,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
I love the Avengers, but Dark Knight was off-manning.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
DC fails.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
This new movie was pretty good, except

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
the tw...

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I liked Catwoman. There was a twist.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I was pleasantly surprised with Catwoman.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Anne Hathaway is a goddess.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Let's just be real. Anne Hathaway deserves

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
to have statues built of her. The ending twist, I should have seen

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
coming because I saw the casting.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
But, it still threw me.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Even though I knew!

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Couple twists, and one of them I

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
saw within like five seconds of the character

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
showing up. I'm like, oh, not

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
that. That's the one I probably

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
should have seen coming because I knew better. Anyway, yeah.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Okay.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
So, next email. I don't want to spoil anything.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Hi again, OLR. Well, Rob,

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
I wrote in last week requesting all your knowledge

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
on Final Fantasy XI as we ventured

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
into Van... Van...

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Vanidel is how he wrote it. I guess it's

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Vanidel. Oh, Vanidel. Whatever.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
To say stepping foot

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
back into that world again was fresh

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
and very nostalgic. I was greeted with many open

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
arms and more than a few people to help me

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
get my gears back in line to play.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Although, after playing for about

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
six hours in between two days, I found myself

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
wishing there were more wowish things

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
about it. Oh well, I guess

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
all other MMOs

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
were the gateway drug to the ultra drug

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
wow as we know it. As a sucker

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
that is on the annual pass plan,

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
I guess I'll go roll a new

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
toon and start my adventure all over again.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Just so I don't feel like I'm

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
giving charity money to Blizzard.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Just

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
really hoping something fresh comes

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
from Guild Wars 2. Not being

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
a hater or a troll, but it

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
would be exciting to see a new MMO

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
come out and be the prolific wow killer.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Your thoughts? And this is from

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Travis. I'm gonna

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
use this opportunity to give a cheap plug

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
to the best little Horde house in Azeroth.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
www.hordehouse.com. It's the

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
other show that I'm on on

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
VOG Network that debuts Wednesdays

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
here at VOG.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I will say this about World

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
of Warcraft. And I've said

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
this many times on Horde House. The

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
game that will kill World of

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Warcraft is

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
World of Warcraft. That's right.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
That's gonna be the thing that kills World

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
of Warcraft is itself. Because

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
this is the type of thing that inevitably happens.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
What's killing Diablo 3?

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Question mark.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Itself. So

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I think the only thing that's gonna

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
really kill World of Warcraft is itself.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Not that that's never gonna happen.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I mean the steam's gonna run out someday.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
And I guess maybe I

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
should say instead of itself I should say Blizzard.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Because whatever Blizzard's next

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
MMO ends up being will probably be

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
I mean as long as they

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
don't make some of the mistakes they made with Diablo 3

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
which I think is inevitably gonna

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
push back Titan or whatever this

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
new MMO ends up being.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
I think it could have

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
a large impact on WoW's user

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
base. But I think World of Warcraft's gonna be around

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
for a long time to come.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Because so many people have invested so much into it.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
It's just the way it is.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
Anyhow. That was it.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Oh that's it. Well then you should send more

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
emails for next week. Mailbag

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
at OrangeloungeRadio.com

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
I wanna hear from some of you PlayStation home folks.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Give us some PlayStation

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
related questions and so forth.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Or I

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
here's a serious question

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
for the home people. Do you think the PlayStation

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
home gets a bad rap? Because there's a lot

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
of people that don't

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
take home very seriously or

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
don't get home. And I'm gonna open in

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Liam Mill. We've been kind of those types of skeptics

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
on the show in the past. Because

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
you know home was kind of

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
plugged as this big

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
centerpiece gateway

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
that you know instead of like the cross

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
bar on your PlayStation it would be home.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
You would walk into home and you would have that

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
you know trophy case filled

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
with all your trophies and so forth. And

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
you know maybe the way we envision home

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
in our mind hasn't actually been

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
what's executed. Do you think

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
your place has gotten

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
a bad rap? I will say

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
this. The community of course is wonderful

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
and events and things like this. And I think home

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
is a lot better

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
now than it was three years ago. And there is

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
a lot to unlock in there.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
And fun stuff. But you know

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
kind of wanna throw that out

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
there. I wanna hear from some of you at our mailbag.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Alright.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
And Black Wolf is reporting

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
from live within PlayStation Home that

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
the PlayStation Home folks agree

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
that Avengers was better than Dark Knight.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Thank you.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
I love you all. I love you all my children.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Cause I mean

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
fucking Hawkeye. Sorry Hawkeye.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Or as

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I've heard

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
one smaller child say not

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Becky's son but like a seven year old

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Hawkeye.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Alright.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Moving on. It's time

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
for us to get angsty in a segment

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
we call the FUs of the Week.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Why do we have a segment called

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
the FUs of the Week? Cause we can.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:18.000
FU.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
While driving to San Francisco

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
yesterday I was

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
on this little bit where the

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
carpool lane splits off

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
to sort of bypass the

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
rest of traffic to get to the

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
just past Emeryville

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
to get to where you pay the tolls.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
And some

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
sixty year old Asian man

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
and now I normally

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
do not support stereotypes

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
but sometimes they exist for a reason.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
There

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
has to be something that

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
enabled the stereotype to

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
exist. Why it's you know usually accepted.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Well definitely driving while Asian.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
In his little Mazda

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
MPV

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
decides that he's going to change

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
lanes right where I am.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
And as

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Marissa is my witness cause she was sitting

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
there in the back. I beat

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Luckily

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
she had some airbags to protect

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
her. I

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
beeped my horn. I flicked

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
my lights.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
And definitely screamed

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
what the fuck are you doing?

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Several times in the car.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
And Becky was in the front seat. She was

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
a mess after

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
cause he ran right into where she was.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Luckily he wasn't going very quickly. We were

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
going at speed. I was at going

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
sixty five because

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
of the way traffic was moving. And some other guy was on my ass

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
so I couldn't slow down.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
There was no right to merge.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
And on top of that he was trying

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
to cross and right where the line was starting to go solid.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Moving that fast

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
having a collision that fast

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I mean no matter what

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
it's lucky. I would have been

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
like Becky. I would have been hysterics like

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I would have been me. She was just tensed up.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Oh no I would have been full on tears.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Well here's what happened.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Me when I panic I either

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
cry or scream.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
And I opted for screaming.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You're very good at it.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
So here's what happened. He basically

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
thankfully

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I guess he

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
got defensive enough or something

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
and I honestly think that he started to pull over when I was

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
in his blind spot. He knocked

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
my passenger side

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
rear view mirror off.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Which I'm very pissed off about because you know I love my car.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I love the Pontiota

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
the rally vibe whatever we call it.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
And scraped up the side of my car

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
I mean it's not bad damage. The car

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
drove perfectly fine after that.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
But um

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
so we stopped in the little divider like right where the

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
lane split. So it was

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
we had room to move around there.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
And

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
he comes out of his car yelling at me.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
So I'm like what the

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
fuck dude you broke my car you

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
still have a mirror.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
And just I was like

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
and he was like yelling

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
stuff I couldn't understand. Like please speak with

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
some intelligence I can't understand you.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
his wife was definitely a lot

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
more reasonable than he was. And we got it worked

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
out and it's funny

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
we're both through AAA for our insurance.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
So I just had to say oh he's with AAA here's his

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
number. Because I'm with AAA.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Oh he's got his record right now.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I've got photos because I

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
am like that and take photos.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Well on my

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
phone.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
And now here's

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
what the stupid thing was in his little

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Mazda MPV

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
he had mattresses

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
stacked right behind

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
their heads to block his rear view mirror.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Including blocking

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
his blind spot.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Which is not illegal

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
but definitely not safe.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
And not good for his insurance.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
And I have photos of it.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Because I'm kind

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
of an anal bitch that way.

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
So um

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
the other parts of

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
my F.U. now go to the California

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Highway Patrol. Now the guy didn't take a

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
report because nobody was injured.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
The cars were relatively

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
fine.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Well

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
they can

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
but at this point

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I was just like fuck it dude I'm hungry

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
and I'm

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
and I'm you know I was

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
you know how I get when I get on that

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
verge of anxiety

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
where I'm just kind of shaky

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
and don't want to deal with shit. That was me.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
So um

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
I stopped and

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
did some deep breathing and but this is

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
funny because we kept seeing people pulled over

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
the whole fucking way from Sacramento

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
to San Francisco and back.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
The highway patrol is everywhere

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
we wait like 20 minutes

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
for them to show up.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Giving out chicken shit tickets

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
is serious business. Very important.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Well it's like

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
and I

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
I have to say that my defensive

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
driving is pretty good.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Except the thing is that I couldn't

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
swerve to the side because there was a wall

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
next to me and it would have been

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
worse to run into the wall

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
than have the dude run into me and I

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I tried to speed up to get around him

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
which is I honestly think that

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
me speeding up was why the

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
collision wasn't worse because

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
and it's like his mirror was just like

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
tipped up just a little bit just tipped

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
up a little bit. Mine was gone.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Mine is somewhere in Emeryville right now.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
So fuck him.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Um now

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
this is the other part of the fuck you.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Fuck everybody on the road who was beeping

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
at us and going nice job.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Didn't help when I

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
got out of the car either.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Keep it classy California.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Well one of the guys managed to

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
stop like slow down

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
just enough for me to go

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
you get out here and fix it then.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And he rolled

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
up his window.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Bastard.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I love it when your anger isn't directed at me.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Alright. Well it's

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
just

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I don't you know I don't get

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
and you know the lady at Allstate

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
she was like oh it's always the people who

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
were at fault that do the yelling. You mean AAA?

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
AAA. Yeah I called Allstate first because

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I was so well when I got home I was

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
every time I looked over to look

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
in my rearview mirror and didn't see it

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
not there I just get pissed again.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
So when I get home I'm so pissed off and shaky

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
and you can ask Marissa. I was pissed

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
off and shaky. I

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
went to Allstate instead of AAA.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Oops. Nice. So

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I'm on the phone with freaking

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Allstate and they're trying to find information for me

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
like wait I'm with AAA. Hang up.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
Well Misty in our chat room

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
at live.vognetwork.com says if I find it

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
when I pass through Emeryville next time I'll get it back

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
for you.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I've got I will

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
share a picture from my Facebook with everyone.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Alright Loki I don't know how you're gonna follow that

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
but good luck. FU?

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
FU to

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
people that change up tournament rules

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
15 minutes before the tournament starts.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Come on. That's a little ridiculous.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Thankfully I'm patient. If my wife had it

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
her way I'd be

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
trying to get my money back.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
I'd be trying to get money for the gas. I'd be

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
trying to deface their

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
website and smear them

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
all over all the other sites. I just

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
I don't I don't want to put

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
that much effort. Thank God Nelly wasn't in

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Jamie's car. You should break off his rearview mirror.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
To kind of go a little bit

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
with what Jamie said. FU

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
to people that change lanes without signaling.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
And there's a lot of them.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
This guy didn't signal either.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
It's like dude you're like

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
and they were elderly people

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
but it's not just elderly people.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
All shapes and sizes.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
In my case it's elderly Asians.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
But seriously I mean and the people that

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
are older

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
not necessarily elderly but like at least

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
in their 50s. Dude how long have you been

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
fucking driving? Really is the

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
turn signal like a new thing to you just now?

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
You haven't figured out how to fucking use it?

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
That's just sheer laziness is what

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
it is. And the fact that you don't signal

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
means probably not looking either so

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
you know fuck those people because

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
they're the ones that are dangerous out there like

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
not paying attention to anything

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
or drifting into other lanes.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
I hate that too. Or when you make a

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
fucking left turn and the guy just like

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
I'm gonna take a really wide turn

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
so I have to go into like the median just to get

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
away from the guy. So fuck people

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
that just don't pay attention

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
on the road.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Well I'll go next.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I don't know I don't really have any traffic I've used

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
this week. Sorry to break form here but

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
I will say this. F you to the

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
fact that I kind of hurt my knee pretty bad

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
last week because in my role

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
that I was playing in Repo the genetic opera

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
I got to die three times

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
as three different cops. So

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
one of the times I died

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I hit the ground pretty hard and I

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
kind of fucked up my knee doing that.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Maybe I should actually wear the knee pads next time

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
but I didn't have time when I changed my

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
costume to get them on because they can

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
kind of be a pain in the ass. So F you to the fact

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
that I fucked up my knee. Oops

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
not that music. This music. Oh yeah one other thing

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
F you to the hills in San Francisco

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
and having to walk uphill both ways.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Just saying. Through the snow. Walking from

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
complain about anything traffic you

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
people are crazy in L.A. You're just

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
constantly in the upright position on the

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
road out there.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Nice. Oh yeah well I

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
earlier.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
But I don't want to

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000

but yeah so yeah F you to

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Well played.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Reminds me of a time when like one of the

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
first times we went out there for

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
I think it was

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
yeah it was for one of the our first E3

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
out there I'll never forget we were driving

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I think to the Final Fantasy

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
concert or something like that.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Something that was on the freeway and I remember

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
we saw someone passing on

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
the right of us we were in the right lane by the way

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
passing on the right they were actually

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
off roading to pass us

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
on the right in the right most lane

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
of the freeway.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
That's that's that's

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
that's ballsy.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
All right two more stories for you guys then we're gonna

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
get to the Skype line at one eight seven

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
seven game O.L.R. but not just yet

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
because we have a few more stories

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
starting with Loki. Yes so one of

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
the games that's being kick started right now is

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
actually another Shadowrun game Shadowrun Online

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
and they talked a little bit more

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
details about their game and showed a little

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
bit of game play which looks pretty awesome it kind of

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
it's like a high res

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
HD version of like the top down

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Shadowrun game on you know Super

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Nintendo except you know the way you shine

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
your graphics and stuff. The game

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
though is gonna be kind of set up like

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Guild Wars where you pay once and

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
basically you're

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
playing the game. There's no month to month fees

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
however of course there's gonna be like micro

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
transactions later on down the line if you want to

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
buy special things and

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
stuff. And also they're showing

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
some of the different things in there

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
they have a portion of the game where

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
okay you go these hub worlds and you get

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
your mission and there's a part of

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
the mission that requires

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
you to do the investigation work and

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
leg work and so if your leg work

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
isn't very good you may not know that hey

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
there's an easier way to get into this

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
you know location

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
in order to get this information or hey

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
this is gonna be heavily guarded by something

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
so you'll kind of you know

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
know a little bit about it

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
but

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
that's kind of cool. And then of course they're saying

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
that the game at launch is gonna

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
retail for $39.99 of course

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
if you back the Kickstarter you'll

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
get the game at $25

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
at that donation level

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
and

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
I guess a new campaign

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
they're gonna be launching every three to

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
four months for $15

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
so it could be kind of add on

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
expansions.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Sound like something you might be putting money down for?

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Maybe, I mean

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I've already backed one

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Kickstarter Shadowrun game

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
so I'd be kind of curious

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
but once again I don't have time for MMOs

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
but the game sounds like

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
it's more

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
single player with other

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
people at the same

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
time kind of I don't know

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
you can play it single player

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
you can play it you know co-op

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
or you can do PVP

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
so it'll be neat

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
I mean I'll have to see when it comes out

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
I'm probably not gonna back it though. Alright

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
just because I've backed too much stuff recently

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
so. Alright one more story

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Skype line and this has to do with

Okay I'm getting a message

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
via Black Wolf from

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
PlayStation Home. Blender wants

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
to do another contest. Pick an animal

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
and the first person to type that animal

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
wins another prize in home. So

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
an animal. What animal

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
are we going to pick? Should we go obvious?

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Dark

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Sakura why don't you pick for us?

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
What animal do you think they should type

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
in the home chat?

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
I can't tell them that though. They have to

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
guess right?

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Pick an animal. Wait

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
wait are we

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
You're going to have to clarify.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Do we say it?

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Do we say it or are they supposed to

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
guess? Okay yeah

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Black Wolf says yes. Say it.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Lemur. A lemur.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Alright there you go.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
I didn't say ferret so all you people who

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
were trying to get the jump know.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Alright a lemur.

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000

You know what else is cute?

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Baby sloths.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
Come on baby sloths are adorable.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
So whatever.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
And no Garris is not an animal.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Garris is

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
turian.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Alright and remember

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
He just said that.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
I'm risking an animal

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
in the sack.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
This is all I hear

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
from people that play Mass Effect so

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Remember. No it's

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
Kayden for me.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
If you talk to the gays they'll all say

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Kayden.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Kayden's an ass

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
who actually his

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
model is like the guy he's modeled

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
after and who did all the face cap and stuff

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
is like a gay partender from the abbey.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
And he's hot.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Oh my god.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
I gotta admit he was easy on the eyes.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Alright Skull King

But you know what he deserves it for

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
for helping support the

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
I gotta open that up 1877 Game OLR

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
The Skyplane is open right now

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
for you guys to give us

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
a call and if you wanna call us

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
from Playstation Home awesome.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
If you're one of our regular listeners who wants to call us

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
that's awesome too. We will talk to you

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
at 1877 Game OLR.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Meanwhile let me get

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
to some Twitter topics. We have a few things

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
that were sent to us via Twitter

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
and I wanna look at this from Tigerclaw

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
cause this tweet here from Tigerclaw just

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
jumps out at me it's like wah wah what?

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Irrational Games

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Job lists 85

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
plus Metacritic score as

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
a requirement.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
This is the developer of Bioshock

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
and Bioshock Infinite. It's Irrational

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Games. They posted a job listing

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
for a design manager

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
and apparently one of their

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
resume or whatever has to have a past

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
work that has a high score

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
on Metacritic. That's

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
kinda surprising. It's posted on the Gamasutra

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
job boards. Credit on at

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
least one game with an 85 plus

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
average Metacritic review score.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
How do you feel

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
about Metacritic score having

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
such weight especially when you consider the games

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
like Child of Eden got an 84

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Mirror's Edge got an 81

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
hmm

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Remember that whole controversy over

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Fallout New Vegas and the bonus they didn't get

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
because it was an 84?

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
hmm

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
So what's

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
the job requirement is that they've had to publish

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
or worked on the game that received

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Metacritic over 85?

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
You have to have some credit. Alright well

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
let's go to the phones. What if like their co-worker

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Bob just really bombed

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
when it came to like you know

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
it's like yeah we did all this really good work but man

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
he just like he's made fart noises

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
into a microphone for all the dialogue in

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
the game and it just

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
really hurt us.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Alright let's go to the phones. Hi

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Hey it's Oscar. Hey Oscar

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Thanks for sitting there waiting while

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
we got through that last conversation.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
What's on your mind buddy?

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Oh that's fine.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
I just wanted to say that this past Thursday

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I made the 6 hour drive

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
back and forth for 12

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
hours total to Virginia

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
like right outside of the DC area to see

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
the Zelda Symphony.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Oh my gosh you drove 12

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
hours to see the Zelda Symphony.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
Well I went to... It was well

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
worth it. I went to LA to see

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
the Dear Friends concert so

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
yeah it's about the same. It was worth it?

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Yeah definitely. Tell us a little bit

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
about the experience.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Like um I don't know did any of you guys buy

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Skyward Sword and like see how they had the orchestra

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
CD packaged in with the game? Sadly

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
no I never got around to that one

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
sadly. Alright well like

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
it has like 7 or 8 or so tracks

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
on that CD and

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
it's

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
they played pretty much most of those but there were so

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
much more like they had complete like symphonic

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
movements in each of the game. Like there was

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Ocarina of Time movement, a Twilight Princess

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
movement, a movement from

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Link to the Past and oh my god

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
the friggin Link to the Past one like I

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
teared up at one part where they did the credits

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
music cause I just forgot about that.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
That game is so good.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Yeah

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
like don't get me wrong Ocarina of Time is my

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
favorite but that game has some moments

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
so that just I don't know.

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
So you didn't just

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
go by yourself I imagine you went with friends.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
Yeah I had a couple friends with me

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
that went like um

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
actually it was one of my friends who posted on Facebook

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
I'm buying tickets today who wants to go

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
and like I was one of the first people to respond

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
and so he bought my ticket

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
which was only $65

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
for that theater it was like the Wolf Trap

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Theater near DC.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
They were really good

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
seats actually like they were pretty

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
close. So you drove from

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
where? You live in Ohio?

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
Michigan? Yeah well I live

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
in Northeast Ohio but my friend

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
who bought the tickets lives down in

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Athens Ohio which is like the Southeastern portion

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
of it so

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
like I had to go down

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
there anyway to like move stuff out of my apartment

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
for the next year

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
so it was no big deal

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
driving down there myself but then

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
he drove to DC for the most part.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Wow that's a long

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
drive but that's awesome

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
I mean sounds like it was quite the experience.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
What was the crowd like?

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Um

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
it was a mixed bag

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
like I thought it was going to be a lot of kids but actually

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
it was only a few

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
and like a lot of teenagers to adults

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
and like

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
the kids that were there like I saw their

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
dads that were with them all had their 3DS's

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
out like it was just a street pass fest

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
like just non-stop I

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
probably got 100 during the course of the day.

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Oh my yeah you probably could have beat

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
find me in

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
one sitting there that's awesome.

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Oh definitely it was

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
I don't know you need to go

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
like you really should like um

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I do if they come back through here.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
The last concert was in San Jose on December

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
14th did you try to link that one?

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Is it? I might just do

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
that actually what day of the week is December

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
14th let's see the 6th is umlaut

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
and that says Thursday so

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
that sounds like it would be a Wednesday no it's a Friday

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
hmm maybe

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
that would be great.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Go to zelda-symphony.com

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
and there should be a link to the schedule up there

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
and you can check it all out. Anyone want to go?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Alright we'll see I'll find

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
maybe Alan will want to go we'll make it a

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
trip I have friends in San Jose too

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Mel and Mel live there and you know them from this show

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
and it would be cool to go see something

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
like that so yeah well thanks

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
for the tip and I'm glad to hear you had a good

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
time. Yeah

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
I just hope that they release like

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
another orchestrated CD like maybe after

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
the tour is done because some of those songs I

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
just really want to hear again. I'm sure

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
they'll be another Zelda pre-order disc in the future.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Yeah there has

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
to be. Alright well

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Osfer I'm going to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
okay? Alright no problem.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Alrighty 1877

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Game OLR our username on Skype is

OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
give us a call. Meanwhile

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
some other tweets

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
one more from Tigerclaw I let people have

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
two tweets just a kind of a quick

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
headline here Microsoft halts

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
further development on what was to be the

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
free-to-play game Flight

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
it was supposed to be a free-to-play entry

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
in Microsoft's Flight Simulator

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
franchise I wonder if that has to

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
do with the Vancouver layoffs we heard about earlier

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
well

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
I don't know it's

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
it's I like the Flight Simulator

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
games back in the day but I mean they're

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
so intricate now like I don't actually

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
know how to fly a plane people

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
but it looked fun and pretty

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
I remember those used to be like the graph that the

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
high-end graphic games with the Flight Simulator

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
games yes Marissa? Well I mean if you

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
really wanted to make them properly accurate you need to have

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
bitchy flight attendants

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
that's a real flight simulator

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
I want to join the Mile High Club

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
that's right so you're about to violate every NDA

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
in the world it's not my NDA

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
it's my friend's NDA

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
I'm violating his NDA sounds very dirty

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
technically by letting you play he's already violated

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
the NDA there you go

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
alright well given I'm not giving out

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
his PSN I'm not giving out my PSN

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
name so go tie it back

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
to me Sony go well I

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
I wouldn't throw down a challenge like that actually

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
but so let's that was a joke

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
so please don't you have

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
allegedly played the beta

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
yes allegedly

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
so why don't you give us allegedly your thoughts

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
um

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
so right now the beta

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
that I allegedly played

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
very much feels like

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
a lifeless Smash Brothers

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
clone which you know

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
not terrible I guess but it's not

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
really fun yet which

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
I think games are supposed to be fun

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
last I heard why wasn't it fun?

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
um

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
because there's no charm to it yet

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
even having Parappa

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
in the beta the beta is only like six characters

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
um and

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
I've only seen two different stages so far

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
but there's

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
just I don't know it's

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
a boring game

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
and Smash Brothers to me is pretty boring to begin

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
with so maybe I'm biased but

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
I expected more you were telling

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
me that the beta is only multiplayer

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
correct? yeah I have to connect

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
to somebody else I can't play against computer players

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
now I have not tried to see if I could

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
play like two people on the same console

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
but part of the problem in the beta

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
right now is you know when you play Smash

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Brothers and you get like every

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
person in like a tight area

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
the camera zooms in it doesn't

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
do that well in this game so

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
it doesn't matter how close you are to the action

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
your character is still really far away

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
and it can make it very hard to figure out what's going

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
on at any given time do you think

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
that might have hurt your impressions a little bit though

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
the fact you couldn't fuck around in single player

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
at all? um

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
no because

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
ideally that style of game is

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
just really

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
multiplayer based I feel like

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Smash Brothers isn't fun by yourself

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
at all let's be real though

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
being able to play online multiplayer is a

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
feature that Smash Brothers I guess the

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
one on the Wii had it but it didn't do it very

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
well it was terrible it didn't really do it very well

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
but to Smash Brothers credit

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
and I'm not like you I like the

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
Smash Brothers games a lot but I

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
think they're bad games I just I think they're overrated

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
let's say that here's the thing

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
that what I always loved about Smash Brothers is that

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
they're very robust packages

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
like there is

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
so much in especially those

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
most recent Smash Brothers games

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
so many unlocks so many other modes

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
so many like mini games and other

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
things to experience you know and a lot

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
of that was brought into Kid Icarus too

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
so I think you know the projects

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
that that team does tend to be very

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
robust experiences

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
and I think if Sony doesn't

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
offer fans that same

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
really rich experience

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
which you're not going to see

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
in such a limited beta I think

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
you are going to feel short changed a little bit

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
well and then

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
one of the things I feel like they really get right

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
are the stages I really

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
like the fact that they change

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
and kind of mix up

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
different games in one stage like I was playing

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
a god of no I was playing

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
the Ratchet and Clank stage and all of a sudden

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
it turned into God of War which is

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
really cool and then

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
one turned into like Padapon

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
I don't remember which stage it also was but

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
I really enjoyed that feature

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
I just after now

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
I didn't know about that leaked list of characters

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
that people you know

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
datamined from the beta I'm kind of sad

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
that there aren't those real

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
robust options

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
that Smash Brothers offers but

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
I will probably get it because

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
I love that Dante and I will

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
play as him even if he's a terrible character

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
so despite everything you just said

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
about not feeling super great about it

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
you're going to buy it anyway

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
because they're adding that Dante that's really really hot

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
it was good enough to make you want to buy it

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
in the end

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
yes well I think it has potential and I think

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
you know I'm not judging

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
really purchasing it based on the beta

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
because you can tell that the

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
beta whatever build they're using is really

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
early on there's a lot of like

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
barren features

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
in it so

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I don't know I just

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
I'm not going to hate the game yet

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
but it still needs to do more to wow me

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I think they can pull it off though

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
well we'll see what happens in the coming months

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
hopefully there's a lot of good stuff to be

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
unlocked and things we haven't seen yet

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
and some of these characters in the leak sound

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
potential which by the way I think

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Shane coming on here and giving his

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
alleged thoughts on the beta he may have allegedly

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
played is a whole lot less of an infraction

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
than whoever hacked the damn files

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
to pull out those unlockable characters

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
yeah and they had pictures of the stages too

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
I kind of thought those stages were neat

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
as the illegal secretary I approve

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
of your legalese ass covering

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
thank you

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
I appreciate that

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
I think we need to hire Marissa as a consultant for other

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
shows in the future

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
oh and Prab is awesome in it like

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
he's really cool

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
do you get to actually rap?

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
no but okay remember

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
that stupid boombox

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
in the game that

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
okay you get to throw him around

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
and I like that because I hate that boombox

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
is there a stage that's you waiting to use

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
the toilet?

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
not in the beta at least

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
because that was like the funniest stage from the first

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Parappa game remember? I love Parappa

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
why won't they do another Parappa game?

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
I need to go just as bad as you

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
it seems like the perfect Playstation Network game

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
the perfect goldmine for Sony is a

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Parappa online game

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
with little minisodes and stuff like that

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
why is Sony not doing this?

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
because Parappa 2 was not that

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
good, they should do another Umjammer

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Lammy because that game was amazing

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
alright I'll take that, Umjammer Lammy is pretty

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
fucking good

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
I'm sad that she's not a leaked character, that would be really cool

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
you know there's always

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
DLC

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
I will buy Umjammer Lammy DLC

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
if I could get the one stage that everybody

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
except for me hates as

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
a stage you can play in the game I would be

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
so excited

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
shame before I let you go

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
we have a question for you from

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
playstation home summerfest

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
blackwolf in

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
playstation home says where is your

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
rhythm thief review?

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
in written form

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
no no no no no no don't spoil it here

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
I want it in written form

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
no I'm not going to spoil my review

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
here's the thing

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
my 3DS is busted

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
so yeah

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
for some reason when I hit the B button

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
it turns off which is usually the

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
function of the off button

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
but um

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
don't say Alan, I can hear Alan

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
laughing at what you just said all the way from the kitchen

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
hello

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
why?

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
because the B button is, nevermind, forget it

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
it sounds like you've got a short

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
is what it sounds like yeah it does

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
sometimes when I hold it funny it turns off

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
I'm like whatever I just don't even want to play you

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
um something inside there

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
yeah and I couldn't find a screwdriver to open up

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
because I would open it up

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
wait yes you did spill something on your 3DS?

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
no no no I didn't spill anything no no

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
did the dog try to eat it?

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
I've got all these tri-wing screwdrivers just sitting in my house

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
aw too bad he lives in Kansas

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
um what I was going to say is

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
I will probably be getting an XL

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
in two weeks thanks to my job

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
so I'll start playing it again

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
which we can't talk about

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
any further on the show but I will

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
talk to the other host about it off air

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
it's like the 3DS but

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
bigger

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
alright moving on uh

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
I guess that's it so when you get your

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
3DS situation figured out we want the review

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
now that it's not timely

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
not

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
my fault I can't even play

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Pokemon do you know what a like a

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
pain that is to me we really need more

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
written content at VoG and granted I'm

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
responsible for this too but I mean

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
I've just had so much going on this week

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
um but uh yeah if you have some time

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
and you're interested in writing for VoG

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
it doesn't have to be about video games it could be anything

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
geeky movies books I would love

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
somebody who reads a lot of books

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
and even comic books and manga

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I bought a book Rob

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
I bought um one of the Vampire

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Hunter D novels that I hadn't read yet

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
it doesn't have to be geeky books because my wife reads a lot of books

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
but I mean like right now she does read

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
a lot of geeky books she reads a lot of

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
you know what your wife

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
is hilarious so yes I don't

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
care what it is she should do book reviews

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
I should say this funny enough

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
I'm seeking a book review

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
I actually am doing one for

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
a friend site of VoG

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
I'm just not done with the book yet but

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out who

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
but I'm hoping to have that done with him next week

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
This is Fifty Shades of Grey

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
It is not Fifty Shades of Grey

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Then you need to redo your review

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
We're like Fifty Shades of Shit

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Fifty Shades of I'm Hanging Up On You Bye

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Bye

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Alright

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Oh lordy how about one more call

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
I don't think he mentioned Mass Effect at all

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
He didn't

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
That's awesome

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Gotcha Shane

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Who's this?

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
This is Azoramay

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Say that one more time?

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Azoramay? Azoramay? What's on your mind tonight?

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
I just wanted to

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
I just noticed that

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
there's going to be like a Final Fantasy 11

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
like revival

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
of music

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
concert going on in your area

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
and I was just wondering if you were aware of that

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
I am very aware of that and I

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
kind of sort of want to go actually

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
it's just about you know if I can convince

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
somebody else to go with me so I don't have to go

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
by myself but yeah it's in Berkeley

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
they're doing like a Final Fantasy 11

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
You know what's funny? When I signed back up for the game

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
about a month ago like I got those emails right away

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
and then that's the log on message

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
I don't know if everybody sees that or I just see it

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
because I'm in the area

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
but when I log into the game it says don't forget

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
you have tickets on sale now for the Final Fantasy 11

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
event in Berkeley!

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
That is so funny because

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
I'm a fan of it

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
but I haven't really logged on it for a while

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
I mean I got a letter

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
via email about it

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
I was really thinking about going

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
but I'm on the East Coast in New York

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
and I actually went to go see

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
the

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Distant Worlds at the Brooklyn Academy of Music

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
and it was really great

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
but like I said I have the same problem

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
as you do trying to convince

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
friends to actually go ahead and see it

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
it's like a once in a lifetime

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
opportunity

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Would you think they're

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
going to bring it out here at all?

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
It really depends on this first one and if it does

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
well that's kind of the deal if it makes money

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
it'll tour

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Here's something else to consider

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
we're going back years and years

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
so you can't really judge what's going on

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
at Square now to these standards

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
but when that first Dear Friends concert

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
happened which was what? That was the first year

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
I went to E3 so that was what? 04 I think?

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
04 or 05? It was 04

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
was Dear Friends

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
and that Dear Friends concert

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
was so good and so well received

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
and so amazing and that

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
in turn had been inspired by that

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
what was it? It was the 222

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
2002 concert they had in Japan

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
that had the CD

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
it did so well that they took that around

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
the country and it was a

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
good show and they took it to a lot of

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
big cities however the next year

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
they did a new show called More Friends

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
that was at the Gibson Amphitheater

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
I think at Universal Studios

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
and I went to that as well because I

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
loved the first one so much and More Friends

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
wasn't good I mean

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
it's not really the fault

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
I don't want to fault the musicians

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
I don't want to fault the guest stars

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
I don't want to fault the talent behind it

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
but just the production of it was

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
really not good and a lot

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
of that was acoustic problems

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
and a lot of the sound problems

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
and there was a lot of live issues and I heard

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
you know I don't know how much truth

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
there is to this stuff but I heard some dude

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
got fired on the spot by Nobui

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Matsu for how freaking terrible

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
More Friends was and

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Oh really? Wow I didn't know that

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
They didn't take that on tour

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
So it was like a once in a

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
lifetime event

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
Yes I can say it was a once

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
in a lifetime event that I got to go to and

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
I do consider myself lucky even though it was a bad

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
show they actually had like the

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
and I forget her name maybe you know it

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
the lady from Final Fantasy 10 who sang

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
that

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
I can't remember the name of the song

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
I'm sorry I can't say it again

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Thank you

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Yeah she was there singing it

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
and so to hear that live was really

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
amazing but that's

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
you know and so I'm thankful

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
for moments like that but

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
I realize you know

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:56.000
overall unfortunately the show was not a success

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Oh okay well I mean that's kind of like

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
all I really had to

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
really ask Hey no it's a great question

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
I'm tempted I will say

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
I'm very very tempted we'll see I'll let you know

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
what I end up deciding

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
Alright thank you Alright take care

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
Take care Bye guy

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Alright thank you so much for the calls tonight

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through but send us an email

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
if you have a comment you want us to read on a future show

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
when he phrases it that way

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
he says it's a once in a lifetime opportunity

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
and I do have to realize this is

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
it might not be like totally my backyard

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
but Xtaphir lives in

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Oakland Berkeley now I could totally like go stay with him

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
for a night and go to the concert

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
so maybe I should

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
you know might not get the chance again

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
and for somebody that wasn't a Final Fantasy 11 for so many years

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
you give me a lot to think about

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
a phone call to

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Orangelaungeradio might just have sent me back about 50 bucks

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
for a ticket we'll see

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000

mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
it does mean we are getting very close

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
to the end of the show

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
we're getting close to the end of the party

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
at Summerfest and Playstation Home

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
last call last call everybody

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
before we close

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
out tonight I'm gonna ask

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Loki if he has any last minute stories

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
nope wow

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
I didn't even look

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
shame on you

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
I couldn't think of anything that we didn't cover

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
that was really really big

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
I do have one of the tweet I will read that

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
and that was from actdeft and it also reminds me to talk about this

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
actdeft tweeted the show and said

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
played beat hazard during the

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
o-l-r break and start of part b

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
quite fun and then he linked

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
it on the steam community or he linked his

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
picture on the steam community

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
this was something I posted on the vog network

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
forums if you're a fan of the game

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
beat hazard and you have it on pc

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
it is very easy to

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
mod the game and it's not like

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
you're not doing a bad thing you are editing

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
text files to the developers like put instructions

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
on how to edit it in there

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
you can actually add your own internet

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
radio feeds cause beat hazard you can play the

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
internet radio and it's very easy to add

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
vog network as a radio feed

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
so yes you could play beat hazard

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
to my voice

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
but it's you know when there

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
is no live or taped program on

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
the voice of geeks network there is a music

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
feed so it's really meant for that

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
but some people are playing along to our voices which I think

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
is kind of funny too so uh you can do

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
that marathon mode

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
so if you like yell something really fast

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
or something that gets harder is that yes yes

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
anti-disestablishmentarianism

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:44.000
I actually do know what it means

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
swear in Jewish frantically there might

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
be a there might be a boss

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:54.000
God that's hot

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
you know it's funny that people think like oh you're Jewish

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
you must have like grown up learning this no I know

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
because I grew up in Los Angeles

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
you know

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
nice

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
alright um

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
if you need more information on how to mod that

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
I posted something on our forums if you're not registered

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000

and so forth misty in chat says

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
Sky's voice the game goes beat hazard

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
alright

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
well with all those tweets and all those

around one last time to get everybody's final

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
thought starting with Marissa tonight

Marissa thank you so much for being on the show

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
that you don't play a whole lot of games you're a

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
nerdy enough girl and I mean that in the best

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000

final thoughts for our listeners? I do take it as a high fob one actually I do

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
I feel like I might need to explain

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
myself a little bit to the audience especially all those

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
new listeners please do

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000

large breasted yappy singer-songwriter

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
slutbag

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
I am a recovering

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
comedian

codes right there in the chat room

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000

that's alright if you don't get one through there

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000

more final thoughts Loki your final

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
thought since you have the mic

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
speaking of Wednesday

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Adams Wednesday happens to be

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
August 1st

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
happens to be when the 3rd gate opens

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
oh shit the race is on

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
do you have time off from work to do it?

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
I took the day off well for multiple reasons I took the day off

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
to take Josh

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
cause it's his second

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
birthday but also

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
because I'm going to be staying up all night long finishing

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
whatever game they have

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
same reason I took

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
September 25th off work

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
understandable

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
I hope

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
the game is not hard enough

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
for me where I can't finish it in one night

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
cause I'm going to be disappointed if

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
I have to stop

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
playing to sleep or

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
do other things

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
but um

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
I don't know

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
who knows what it is no one knows I just hope it's not a crappy

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
Facebook game please not be a crappy Facebook

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
game cause that was already a

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
crappy Facebook game for Gate 2 and I

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
can't take another one I will just say

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
I will throw over a table and just say fuck it

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:42.000
I'm going to sleep

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
