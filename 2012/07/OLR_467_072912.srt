Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

Tonight, July 29th, 2012

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Will one new non-MMO game require a monthly fee?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Game developers speak up on Windows 8

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could used digital games soon be a reality in the US?

Orange Lounge Radio

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is episode number 467 for this July 29th, 2012

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
To talk about video games, gaming culture, you know, our community

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And cool things, and off-topic things

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
With my co-hosts, say hello to the one and only

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How are you? Welcome back

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hi

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How was the wedding? You were in Vegas last week for a wedding, right?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was very lovely

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And very Jewish

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Congratulations to Dan and Tiara once again

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Even though we said it about five times last week

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There was an open bar

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Was there?

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, then you had a blast at the wedding

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I had many, many amaretto sours and raspberry vodka with cranberry sauce

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Cranberry juice

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Cranberries, gross

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And mudslides and other things that people just put in front of me

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And said, here, drink this, and champagne

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So you'll drink anything someone puts in front of you?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
People that I know and trust to put liquor in front of me

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Nice, nice

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was very good, it had a very good time

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And it was good to see everybody

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And get my nails did

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, yeah

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Awesome

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hi

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How are you, Loki?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm doing good

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Good times

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I like your shirt, by the way

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're wearing a shirt that actually says, Loki Charms

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes, it was the ripped apparel shirt from a couple days ago

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I like it

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or actually about a week ago

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, yeah?

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We have a special guest joining us tonight here in studio

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And some of you old school Orange Lounge Radio fans might remember her

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because she has been on the show before, but it's been a very long time

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am so happy to welcome back to the show

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Marissa

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello

66
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How are you, Marissa?

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm great, how are you?

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I am fantastic

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you so much for coming back to Orange Lounge Radio

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Great to be here

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
For those who don't remember

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All you need to see are her boobies

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They are very nice breasts

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And I don't mean to sound like a pig or whatever

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But, I mean, seriously, girl

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They entered the room before me

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't forget to talk right into that microphone

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Because it's not very sensitive, unfortunately

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So they can barely hear you

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's not nearly as sensitive as Rob

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I mean, I have to do it because it's been years later

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why am I not, I'm not here

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is the mic on?

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Testes one, two

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't know, it's like very quiet for some reason

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why don't you just pick up Loki's mic?

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hello, hello?

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello, is that better?

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Much better, now I can actually hear you

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Alright, how are you Marissa?

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm great, thank you

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Despite the technical failure

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why don't you tell the boys and girls listening at home

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And in PlayStation Home, which I'll get to in a minute

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I haven't forgotten you guys

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why don't you tell them about yourself real quick

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, I'm a music geek

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Singer-songwriter and, you know, collector of vinyl

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And all sorts of music

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And I also, as far with regard to gaming

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm an adventure game geek

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You know, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

103
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And King's Quest and, you know, things as such

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm not really that up to date with the modern stuff

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But there have been some recent, you know, not that recent

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But, you know, adventure games

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You hear a little blip about them every now and again

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They're having a nice little renaissance

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thanks to, kind of, a lot of the stuff that Telltale's been doing

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And the indie community especially has been very big on this

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like, I know there was the King's Quest fan thing

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The silver lining, which was really awesome

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And, you know, the fan community's just great for that stuff

114
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That was great

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, actually, I came up here specifically to see this band, Prilosis

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And if any of the buddies in Sacramento, I highly recommend that you check them out

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They're a metal band

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They're also actually hilarious

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They have a great YouTube channel

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And that's also Prilosis.com

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And for anybody that's into metal music, I just had to recommend them

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because that was a lot of fun and they're fantastic

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But that's more music geekery for me

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's no problem because now the network is about everything geek

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's voice of geeks

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, a little music geekery on our show, it's A-OK

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Especially for metal fans

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, I'm not even actually a metal fan by nature

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But I really enjoyed it

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They're really melodic

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And it's just amazing, though, how one can expand your horizons

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Especially when it involves people that are really musically gifted

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But you do a lot of music playing yourself, right?

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I do a little bit of singer-songwriter stuff

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Bitching about ex-boyfriends with an acoustic guitar and stuff like that

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you're like a Lilith Fair, basically

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Not that bad, but

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm doing a lot of jazz covers recently

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have a guitar player and it's been a lot of fun

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hanging out at this place called Kulak's Woodshed North Hollywood

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And they webcast actually live all their shows

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Nice

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And it's kind of a singer-songwriter deal as well

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Very cool

146
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, welcome all the way from LA

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Appreciate you stopping by tonight

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So happy to see everyone

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Speaking of live webcasting, I'm going to transition to this

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is going on tonight, a little special event

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The VOG Network got asked to be a part of

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
PlayStation Home Summerfest is going on right now, live

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I know we have some new listeners tonight

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because of the PlayStation Home Summerfest

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will say this is an unofficial event

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's not something that Sony is really sponsoring

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But I bet they're really happy it's going on

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Because there's lots of people

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's fan-organized and lots of different communities

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Be they gaming communities or PlayStation Home specific communities

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so forth are coming together

162
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
To basically put on a week-long event of

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey, let's get a bunch of awesome people together

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And, you know, dance, have contests

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Talk to each other, kind of get a chance to meet new people

166
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I spent all of the last hour during Bobby Blackwolf's show

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because he's before us live at vognetwork.com on Sunday nights

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, right before us

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I was in PlayStation Home during his show

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And just kind of really seeing the community

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It was almost like watching an episode of Cheers

172
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Where people would show up

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Norm!

174
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Everybody seemed to know each other

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I thought it was really cool

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In a way I felt like an outsider

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But everybody was super welcoming

178
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was like saying hello when I was talking about VOG

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And people were actually pretty receptive

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
During Bobby's show he got a caller from somebody

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That had never listened to VOG before

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But was listening because of PlayStation Home

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I just thought that was a great cross-promotional opportunity

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So if you are listening live

185
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And you are in PlayStation Home

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I do want to point out Bobby Blackwolf is in there now

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And he's going to be feeding me comments from PlayStation Home

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
To possibly read during the show

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He just got there

190
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So give him a big hello

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And be sure to shout out hogwash for him

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So he can see

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's become the rally cry of tonight in PlayStation Home

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I noticed that during Bobby's show earlier

195
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Of course if you want to do things the old fashioned way

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Nothing wrong with that

197
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not going to ignore you guys

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In our always present chat room

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Live.vognetwork.com

200
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is where the traditional IRC based chat room is

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you want to join that and chat along with the show

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can also check in to the show at VOG Network

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
As we are live here and get your VOG points

204
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And maybe a little bit of loot

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Alright

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Stan in our chat room

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
At live.vognetwork.com starts us off tonight saying

208
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Rob is there a way to stream the live podcast

209
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
On PlayStation Home

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Cause I'll switch if I can

211
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know sadly I don't think that's something that's possible yet

212
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Because I don't think you can really do

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like streaming music or any of that yet

214
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We should all let Sony know that's something we want in the future though

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Cause how awesome would it be if in that VOG Network clubhouse

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We could actually have like a VOG Network feed

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That would be like the best thing ever

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So who knows anything's possible in the future

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So BlackWolf is reporting that

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
From PlayStation Home

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That the club channels just died again

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Our party is crashing the servers y'all

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do we know how to party or what?

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Alright

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Anyhow so yes again a big hello to you guys

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
At PlayStation Home who are listening tonight

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let me throw out some names I remember from before

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Manda Panda

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Jay

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Steven

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Junebug

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That guy who had the 91 on the back of his shirt

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That made me feel insignificant no just kidding

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But yeah I want to say hi to all you guys who are

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Listening right now

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Alright

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And also some of the

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OL Army and VOG regulars

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Are in Home Summerfest right now

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I saw Tigerclaw in there earlier and I saw

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Spaznators and some of the other people

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So that's pretty cool there's kind of the cross

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Promotion stuff going on so that's what it's all about

244
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's just promoting community and

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And cool people meeting other cool people

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I know PlayStation Home

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Has had it's share of you know

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Some people still don't get it

249
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And I even admit I've sometimes

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Been a little critical of Home on the show

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But that has nothing to do with the community

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's only about the software

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That sometimes it can be a little slow

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And tough to connect to things but

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It really has changed a lot

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Since that first beta

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So if you haven't checked out PlayStation Home in the past three years

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Seriously there's like a million mini

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Games now tons of prizes you can

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Get for your avatar and just like cool little

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Knick knacks it really is worth checking

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Out if for nothing else than just to

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Meet some of the awesome people that are on

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The PlayStation Home community

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Alright

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Before we get started with

267
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Tonight's show I wanted to do a quick

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Kickoff topic which I think might have

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Been just saying hello to Marissa and

270
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Interviewing her a little bit

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's see Marissa

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So you like adventure games

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What is your favorite video game

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ever?

275
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It really does have to be Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I really just love that game

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you have a thing for Harrison Ford? Let's be real

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No but I have a thing for fedoras

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I really do

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Damn I left mine out in the car

281
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No true story

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
One of my other passions besides internet radio and video games

283
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have been a member of like live shadow casting

284
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
For midnight movies like Rocky Horror Picture

285
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Show especially right for like

286
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
12 years well lately

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've started doing stuff with Repo the genetic

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Opera which is you know one of this

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah that's kind of I hate

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Calling it the new Rocky Horror because it's not

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's just a new

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Cool phenomenon that also happens to be

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
At midnight

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Exactly it's kind of like the shadow casting

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Thing of the now and last night

296
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They did the 80's repo show

297
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And I got to do Indiana Jones in a

298
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Special cameo which was awesome

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Did you bring your whip?

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They did a joke

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Where the Paris Hilton

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Character Amber Sweet is kind of like a dominatrix

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So they did a joke where I came out

304
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
As Indiana Jones

305
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And she stole my whip

306
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That was kind of the joke which was super cute

307
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But the audience cheered

308
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I felt hot

309
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Awesome

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It was a good time anyhow

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's get to video games

312
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Speaking of games I know where to start

313
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This week Loki I want to talk to you for a minute

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright so you've been talking

315
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
For weeks about this

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Contest this competition you

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Were going to be at this weekend

318
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's hear about it how did it go?

319
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was terrible

320
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ok what was this that you went to?

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ok so I went to a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

322
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Contest it was going to be 2 on 2

323
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you know for a while I was trying

324
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
To find someone to go with and I had my

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
One of my friends brothers was going to go

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
With me and so everything sounded

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Cool because he plays a lot of you know

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Call of Duty I play

329
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Quite a bit and you know

330
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The rules were a little weird

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It was basically custom classes

332
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But there were certain restrictions on what kind

333
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Of loadout you can have and that was fine

334
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I practiced with you know the loadout

335
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That I could

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Work with in the

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Rules of the

338
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Tournament and so I was kind of ready

339
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I had everything set up

340
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ok so here comes Friday

341
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You know the Friday before

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The tournament

343
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Literally about 2 o'clock

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
My co-op

345
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Partner drops out

346
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So I have no one to go with

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So I'm like fantastic ok

348
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So I you know I

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000

Because you know and he's like yeah he plays

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let me see if he can go

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000

Alright that's fine you know

That should be ok with you know I'll take them both on

361

So I drove down there

Like an hour and a half down to

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Stockton and

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So I'm

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
At the shopping center where this place is

369
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And I can't find it at first so I

370
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Look up on Facebook because

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This plaza is actually

372
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
On both sides of the street I'm like oh that's probably

373
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
On the other side of the street let me just look up where it's at

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So when I go to look it up

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I notice that there's an update in the events

376
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh by the way

377
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We changed all the rules

378
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh how convenient thank you

379
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How convenient so they're all oh by the way

380
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Now we're not doing custom classes we're just doing

381
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The standard classes that are there

382
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And with no restrictions I'm like

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You gotta be fucking

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Kidding me I drove all I'm like fine

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You know what I drove all this way

386
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm gonna play at least

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So I get there sign up and everything oh by the way

388
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Now we're gonna not do kill streaks

389
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So it's like what the fuck

390
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So ok so fine whatever I'll play

391
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So I got hooked up with somebody else

392
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And then it was just kind of it just kept going

393
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Downhill from there oh yeah

394
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We don't have headphones for

395
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Anybody so you can't really hear what's going on in the game

396
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Oh um

397
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The person that we

398
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Put you with he doesn't even

399
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Really understand what kind of tournament it is

400
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And he thinks it's a free for all tournament

401
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
First and then finally figures out

402
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a co-op tournament so at this point

403
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm like there's no fucking way we're gonna even win

404
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
One round and that's exactly what happened we played

405
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
First and we lost both of our rounds immediately

406
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Because it was just a clusterfuck

407
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I guess I had been practicing

408
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
With a certain class all week long

409
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Per expectations to the tournament

410
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And then they fucking switched it all up on me

411
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So I'm like god damn it I don't know what fucking class I'm gonna play

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And did they ask you, you mad bra?

413
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Oh no oh it gets better than that

414
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It gets better I'm like ok so what the hell

415
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean why did you guys change the instructions

416
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh well it's actually supposed to be standard classes

417
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
All along but that's what we've been telling everybody

418
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's been coming in here you know the past few weeks

419
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh the past few weeks so you've known

420
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
About this shit and you've been telling everybody

421
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh but you fucking failed to update it

422
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
On Facebook so that you know people that were

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Coming out of town would know anything about it

424
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well I don't know I'm just

425
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm just working here

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It was a big fucking mess

427
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So yes I didn't enjoy

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Myself but at least you know what at least I didn't

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Spend that much time in Stockton

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I played for a few minutes

431
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I got to meet with my customer and devs

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Down there and I left and that was it

433
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Dungeonbuster in our chat room at

434
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Live.vognetwork.com says the rage

435
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Gauge is nearing critical

436
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
DJ Morpheus is counting the number of F bombs

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That you're dropping I do want to

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because we do have an influx of new listeners

439
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Tonight thanks in part in

440
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Large part to the Playstation Home Summerfest

441
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I just want to remind everybody it is a mature

442
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Audiences show so please put the kids to

443
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Bed or put headphones on

444
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's be honest I mean come on I mean there's

445
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
People that I've been to video game tournaments

446
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Before you don't go to a tournament

447
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That changes the fucking rules

448
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Nah that's messed up like 10 minutes before the

449
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Tournament starts like back in the day if it was like a

450
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
DDR tournament like oh man

451
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That tournament would have been smeared on DDR

452
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The next day yeah it's just it's

453
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The next day the same day

454
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The same day it was ridiculous

455
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We couldn't we didn't have live blogging back

456
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
In that day but we had laptops at

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Tournaments there was but see no one else was

458
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Pissed there except for me because everybody else

459
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Everybody else there was local and so they

460
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Had been in the shop at least a couple times

461
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Before you know tournaments started so they

462
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Were aware of the the change in the rules

463
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But no one fucking mentioned it

464
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
At all it was just

465
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It was really annoying but whatever you know what

466
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I I even like

467
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I contemplate I'm like do I really want to drive down

468
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Stockton since it's just going to be myself you know

469
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I do want to point out Wicked is in our

470
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Chat room right now saying yay Loki

471
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Was in my neck of the woods

472
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So you are bashing one of our listeners

473
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hometowns right now but let's be real

474
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Dude bro you live in Stockton

475
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You know what though

476
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Your city's bankrupt

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let me put it this way it at least

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The tournament was in a

479
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Seemed like a good portion of Stockton like the

480
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The shopping mall was actually pretty

481
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Nice I mean so

482
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A compliment from Loki everybody

483
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The mall was nice

484
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Was it by the S Mart?

485
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't know where the S Mart is but

486
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But there you know in the game

487
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Store was nice it's just I'm unfortunately

488
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You have an idiot running your goddamn tournaments

489
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's the only problem and I don't know

490
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It may very well be that this guy

491
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Is new to running tournaments because I hear

492
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That their fighting game tournaments run okay

493
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But then again I'm sure they're not switching up

494
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Rules you know it'd be funny

495
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hey let's go play

496
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Marvel vs Capcom 3 tournament

497
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh and the reason too

498
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The reason that they changed up all the rules is because

499
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oh well we didn't want someone to say

500
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh well the only reason you won is because you got this kill streak

501
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And the helicopter killed me

502
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Too fucking bad you can get the kill streak too

503
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Damn it that's what I was planning

504
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Exactly too fucking bad if you get killed by something

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Or a certain gun or something

506
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That classes have

507
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You have all of these guns available to you

508
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And you're playing by the same rules

509
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Why can't you fucking just suck it up

510
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That you just sucked instead of

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Forcing these people

512
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Which I say to just succumb to their peer pressure

513
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
To change the rules at the very last second

514
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Because

515
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh we don't want to hear someone bitching wine

516
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well you know what you're fucking hearing me bitching wine about it now

517
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Because I had to drive 90 fucking minutes

518
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
To your stupid tournament

519
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Which I will

520
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh and by the way

521
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I love my customer but

522
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm like so are you coming back for Stockton Fest

523
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm like no I'm not fucking coming back to Stockton Fest

524
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I am not driving to Stockton ever again

525
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
When I drive to LA

526
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I will drive around Stockton

527
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The last time I went to Stockton someone stole my Xbox

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This time I went to Stockton

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Fucking tournament sucked

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm not coming back to Stockton

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There will not be a three strike law here

532
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is two strikes we're done

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm not going back to Stockton

534
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Wicked in our chat says

535
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Trust me if I didn't have to live here

536
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I wouldn't

537
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hey trust me

538
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm sure it's just

539
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It has nothing to do with Stockton

540
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This could have been run in Sacramento and had an idiot running tournament

541
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It doesn't matter

542
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You don't fucking change the rules

543
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
At the last second

544
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay if you're going to change the rules

545
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can understand if it was like

546
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey you know what you guys

547
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We said all these restrictions

548
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Are in place

549
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But we're just going to lift the restrictions now

550
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay that's not so bad

551
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because I can still play with the class I had

552
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Or I can change it up a little bit

553
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Instead of oh by the way now you have to stick to one of these

554
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Six classes

555
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh and you know that sucked

556
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And you can at least get some killstreaks and stuff

557
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But we're going to take those away too

558
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Wicked in our chat room says

559
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Aw you won't come back to Stockton

560
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Not even if I bake cookies

561
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No

562
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Sorry

563
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm going to vomit all over the entire town

564
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We're going to have to broker like a Loki Stockton

565
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Peace Summit in like Lodi or something

566
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know

567
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We're going to have to figure that one out

568
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Alright look we're too many local jokes

569
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's a worldwide show

570
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The rule I mean just

571
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The lesson to be learned here is

572
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You got to be I guess you have to be aware of how the

573
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Wherever local stores

574
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are running a tournament

575
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
How they handle things

576
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Because I mean honestly no one should be changing the rules

577
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And I noticed they deleted the event

578
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
On Facebook so no one can comment

579
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
On it or anything

580
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They must have had a few

581
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Angry people

582
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Who won?

583
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't care I wasn't going to stick around

584
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Who cares like I felt bad for the guy

585
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That was playing with me I'm like well

586
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like is it like the second game

587
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Basically it was

588
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh and that was the other thing they changed too because it was single

589
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Elimination first and then it was like oh best two out of three now

590
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm like is it best two out of three or single

591
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Elimination well it's best two out of three then

592
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If you lose once then you're out

593
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay fine

594
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That doesn't even make sense

595
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Whoever loses the best two out of three

596
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And then or wins the best two out of three moves on

597
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Then the loser is done

598
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So

599
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
They so we did this

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
So we lost our first round because it was like okay

601
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's try to get ahead and we were doing alright

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I mean it wasn't like we lost by a whole

603
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Ton

604
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's still you know quite a few

605
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Points but it wasn't like you know

606
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We had 100 points and they had

607
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
2500 or something it was pretty decent

608
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But

609
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You know we had already lost our first game so that put us at a disadvantage

610
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
For the second round because the second round it's like well

611
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We have to come to them because they're not

612
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You know in order to

613
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Win this and so it just unfortunately

614
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
We had the advantage there

615
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Alright we have a comment coming out of Playstation Home

616
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The man Bobby Black Wolf is in he does

617
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The show before us Sunday nights

618
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
On VOG Network he is in Playstation Home

619
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Right now feeding me comments because I can't

620
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I can't see the TV it's too far away

621
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm in there doing the running man I can see everybody

622
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
In the circle doing the running man which was

623
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Cracking Marissa up when she walked through the door

624
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But I can't actually read

625
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The chat because it's too far away

626
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But Black Wolf says the spasinator

627
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
In Home says if Loki vomited

628
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
All over Stockton he'd probably

629
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Improve the place

630
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
A circle of running men just sounds

631
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Dirty too

632
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Alright

633
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Let's talk about our gaming

634
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Weeks and the other actual games

635
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We've been playing this week hopefully not at

636
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Tournaments in Stockton that caused us to rage

637
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Dark Soccer we'll start with you tonight

638
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How was your gaming week?

639
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It was Mass Effect-y

640
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That was really about it

641
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Because that's really about all I played that and

642
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Some words with friends

643
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Ewww Zynga game

644
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Whatever Judging you

645
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Whatever No I know it's popular

646
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's real popular I don't care if it's popular

647
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's addicting I've been playing a really

648
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Addicted game I mean I'm like cutting and talking

649
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
About something in my week real quick but I've been

650
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Playing well no this is important

651
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I've been playing when don't I ever

652
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Make a topic about me Dark Soccer

653
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Even over what 10 years alright

654
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
More than that

655
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There's a game on iPhone called

656
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Song Pop I think is the name of it right

657
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Now and it's really fun it's like guess the song

658
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
As fast as you can like it's like

659
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Name that tune yeah yeah right

660
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So you gotta check this out but here's

661
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The problem we're all just looking at our

662
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Watches counting down how long before

663
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Zynga buys them

664
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
How long before Zynga buys them

665
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well Zynga's already getting burned because I think they're

666
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Starting to realize that's ooh

667
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I heard there's like all this I don't think it's

668
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
In our show tonight there's like all this scandal

669
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Like the guy sold his stock like the CEO

670
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Sold like a bunch of his stock like two months

671
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Ago and then they had the report

672
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Like you know insider trading

673
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Investigation since you interrupted I'm gonna

674
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Interrupt you as well that's cool since we're talking

675
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
About Facebook games and stuff

676
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let's talk about Facebook real quick

677
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Facebook in case anyone

678
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Hasn't fucking noticed

679
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Is a little broken right now

680
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because you cannot

681
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Unsubscribe from people's comments and likes

682
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Or updates by games

683
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I try I don't fucking care about

684
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Your stupid song game or whatever

685
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm trying to hide that shit but Facebook

686
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Does not want to let you know what's funny I thought

687
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I set all that shit to private

688
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like are you seeing my song song other people

689
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Oh okay Bobby

690
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's alright and you know I don't mind

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That kind of stuff it's mainly people

692
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Commenting on other people's like cat photos

693
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I really don't care if you think that's a cute cat

694
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Or not but it's it's up

695
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's Facebook's problem because all that stuff

696
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Was hidden before and now it's not

697
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I just want to make it known that this is an

698
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Issue so everybody can also make it

699
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Known to their friends that this is an issue because

700
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It no one seems to be fixing it

701
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
It's been like this for a week I think the real

702
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Issue is that I heard this one into

703
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Place a couple weeks ago like if in group

704
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's say you're in a group and you make

705
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
A post in that group now

706
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You can see when everybody

707
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Read that post uh-huh

708
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I kind of think that's like a privacy violation

709
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
In messages surprise

710
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I want to be able to stalk people with

711
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Impunity

712
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Exactly I can see that too with

713
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Messages direct messages that you send to people

714
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
On Facebook you can see if they've read it or not

715
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Whatever happened

716
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
To good old fashioned anonymous ignoring you

717
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's just like those emails with read

718
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Receipts and stuff like that I love deleting

719
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Those before they get sent

720
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's terrible well actually

721
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I mean I have to

722
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Bitch about Facebook too because they're totally

723
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Fucking over page owners right now

724
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I mean I would I understand

725
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That you know that they're a for profit entity

726
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And they have to make money but I operate I operate

727
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Several pages myself for musicians

728
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And one for a venue that I work for

729
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And you know it's very important for our

730
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That mic is cutting in and out sorry about that

731
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Live radio kids hello love ya

732
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Okay burning with fire

733
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I know um

734
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah I operate several pages for musicians

735
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And for venues and for a venue that I work for

736
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And um I completely

737
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Understand that Facebook is a for profit

738
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Entity and they need to make money

739
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So I'd be happy to pay for extra features

740
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
However to pay for just

741
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Basic exposure that would normally if you were

742
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
On a friends page would just go out to all of

743
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Your friends is bullshit I'm sorry

744
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
On Facebook you pay with your

745
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Soul this is true

746
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm not gonna how do you like your Farmville

747
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Now

748
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I completely agree

749
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But yeah I mean page owners if you didn't know that already

750
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Your um your posts

751
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Aren't getting Zuckerberg is watching you

752
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Masturbate Shalom

753
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm allowed

754
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
To say that

755
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
For the record

756
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But yeah

757
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I mean if you

758
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
For any page owners that didn't know this earlier

759
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Unless you're you know paying for their extra services

760
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
You make a post to um on your page

761
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's not going to reach your whole audience

762
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
At all Marissa we really just need

763
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
To show on vog where we giggle for an hour

764
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This is true

765
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Giggle time

766
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Oh dear what have I started

767
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Tickle fest

768
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yay

769
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Alright

770
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh yeah this was Dark Soccer's gaming week at one point

771
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Well fuck all that I'm looking up

772
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Mass Effect t-shirts

773
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I was not familiar with Mass Effect

774
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And Jamie did introduce me to that character

775
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Glorious Baritone he is lovely

776
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh he's a lovely voice

777
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
The guy that was his voice actor was on

778
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
An episode of Buffy as like this real douchebag

779
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Who was like this horrible character

780
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh really? Yeah it was in season 7

781
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So it doesn't count

782
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Can you celebrate your heart?

783
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He has a very nice lower register that's all I can say

784
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Well then Marissa I'll ask you about your gaming week

785
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
It sounds like you got exposed to Mass Effect

786
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
A little bit

787
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
My new wallpaper by the way is the

788
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Citadel smooch

789
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's it? Watching other people

790
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Play Modern Warfare and then getting

791
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yelled at for stealing their bandwidth

792
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Has pretty much been the rest of my gaming week

793
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
God dammit are you on the internet

794
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sorry

795
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's like Sunday nights at OLR

796
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
When Alan mistakenly

797
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Downloads BitTorrents God dammit are you getting porn?

798
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Trying to do a show

799
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm trying to

800
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Hack into our neighbor's connection

801
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
His connection's name is Mr. Touchy's

802
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Uncle Touchy's puzzle basement

803
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But I haven't been able to figure out his code yet

804
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
It's a Patton Oswalt joke

805
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
As long as it's

806
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You won't wear a shirt and you'll cry

807
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You can hack it pretty easy

808
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I can send you the link

809
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Lifehacker had an article on it

810
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Alright

811
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
We'll go move on to Loki

812
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Loki how was your gaming week besides Stockton?

813
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hey Stockton just was unfortunate

814
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But this week

815
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I didn't even finish mine

816
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I thought you were done

817
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Fuck you fuck everybody

818
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm bi

819
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Alright you're done

820
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Okay so um

821
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
No no no no no hold on

822
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I had to walk away so I wouldn't time out of home

823
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You said and I quote

824
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I've just been playing Mass Effect

825
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I might have played other things

826
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But when you say

827
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I just played Mass Effect

828
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Well I did just play Mass Effect before we left the house

829
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
That is true

830
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
She made it sound like

831
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Oh forget it I'm not having a grammar war

832
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
With this woman

833
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Fine lady how was the rest of your gaming week?

834
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Uneventful

835
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
She is a level

836
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
She is a level 50 grammar knight by the way

837
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
She's a level 50 bitch right now

838
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
No Rob 69

839
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm sorry bitch it's a subclass

840
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You need to put a B in a circle on the back of your shirt

841
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
When you go into Playstation home

842
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Alright Loki how was your gaming week?

843
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Now do I have permission to move on to the show?

844
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Carry on carry on

845
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Thank you

846
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
How are you enjoying hosting the Olympics your queen?

847
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
All these countries used to be mine

848
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
No I have to do

849
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I have to do the proper

850
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
All of these countries used to be mine

851
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
We are not amused

852
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
May the odds be ever in your favor

853
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Okay alright Loki

854
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Now you may proceed

855
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So this week I played well Call of Duty

856
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Of course

857
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Also played a little bit of Borderlands

858
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And a little bit of Just Cause 2

859
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Had to stop playing Just Cause 2

860
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Cause my computer felt like it was gonna melt down

861
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Which means I had to

862
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Make some modifications

863
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It ended up that my cat apparently

864
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Was using the inside of my

865
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Or the heat fins for my

866
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Cooler inside my

867
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Laptop as a lint

868
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Collector and so there was a

869
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Nice layer of cat hair in there that I

870
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Found when I

871
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Disassembled everything so

872
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Thankfully that was easily remedied and then

873
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I drilled holes in the bottom of it

874
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Because

875
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
These Asus laptops, the older ones

876
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Just had really piss poor

877
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Cooling so it's actually helped

878
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
A lot and um

879
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It doesn't feel like I'm shooting fire

880
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Out of the side of my laptop right now

881
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Um and then

882
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I got

883
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It's never good to have a hot laptop on your crotch

884
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Because then you really get fire crotch

885
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Well then you have

886
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Roasted sausage

887
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No no I used to

888
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I have a cooling pad

889
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
They put on there but yes before when I

890
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Icy hot?

891
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
A metal

892
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Metal pad with fans in it

893
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Anyways um no but when I had

894
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Before I had all the

895
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Cooling modifications to it I would burn my

896
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Legs playing games on

897
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
My laptop so yes that's

898
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It is possible to do that

899
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And it got so hot too that

900
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Like I was burning my hands not

901
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Touching my laptop on top of

902
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
My keys it was just getting that hot

903
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm like okay starting to smell things

904
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Burning probably should cool it off

905
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Wow um so yeah

906
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So I think we're good we're in a good spot

907
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Now because all the other spots that I haven't

908
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Drilled holes in don't really have any processors

909
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Underneath them so it's probably not

910
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Necessary um and then

911
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Played Minecraft a bit more of that that's

912
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Kind of fun we just started kind of exploring

913
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
The area and the new

914
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
What was it uh

915
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Octocock Minecraft

916
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Scene um

917
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's actually a very boring map so

918
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I might want to start another one

919
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Um and then

920
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Um what else

921
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh I have a beta key

922
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
For the little big planet carding thing

923
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I haven't gotten a chance to try yet

924
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Thank you Loki by the way

925
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No problem um

926
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And

927
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's pretty much it I just have a lot of stuff

928
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I'm you know a lot of it was just

929
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Hinging on cooling my laptop down so I can play

930
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
More Borderlands again because it was just getting

931
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So hot I'm like I don't want to break anything

932
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
In there alright

933
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Talking about my gaming week um I played

934
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Borderlands a little bit I was really

935
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Busy during the weekend because of the shadow casting

936
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Events going on this weekend but um earlier in the week

937
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I played Borderlands like a little more

938
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Seriously this time I mean not

939
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
A lot a lot I only probably got to like level

940
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
10 or 11 which you know is is

941
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Change in the scope of things but it gave

942
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Me enough time to get a better feel for the game than what I

943
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Played of it before and I like it it's

944
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Kind of like I think

945
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
The description of World of Warcraft

946
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
As a first person shooter is somewhat

947
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Accurate except it's not really an MMO

948
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But you can play the multiplayer

949
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That was the only thing that felt a little

950
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Disjointed for me and like this is gonna

951
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Sound negative but it's really not like I do really

952
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Enjoy the game you guys but I kind of thought

953
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It was weird that like it's the same you can use

954
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
The same character in your single player

955
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And in multiplayer I know

956
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You can use different too but it was

957
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It just felt a little disjointed like here I

958
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Am doing some quests in single player and then here

959
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We are multiplayer and so

960
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And so is kind of off doing this and so is off doing

961
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This and kind of like we're all completing quests

962
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm not able to really follow along I'm not

963
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Able to get into it as easy so it's kind of like

964
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I feel the need to play through this game

965
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Once single player just

966
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
To like know the story

967
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And know everything and then go back and do

968
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Multiplayer and

969
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Okay for real GameSpy

970
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Is the multiplayer client like what is this

971
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
1998

972
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But

973
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay I realize the game is a few years old

974
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm not gonna I'm hoping Borderlands

975
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm hoping Borderlands 2 uses

976
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Something a little more modern

977
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That just kind of surprised me I'm like

978
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You know I'm missing origin

979
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Right about now Maybe it runs really well

980
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Because no one uses GameSpy anymore

981
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Maybe maybe maybe that's the secret

982
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I don't know but yeah I mean

983
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Borderlands was it's fun I mean

984
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's more of an actual

985
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Like shooter than like Mass Effect

986
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Which I was talking about before that

987
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You know remember I said I was playing a lot of Mass Effect

988
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Multiplayer and it makes me want to play a first person shooter

989
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Because I'm really enjoying Mass Effect

990
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And the most people suggested I play Borderlands

991
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I think it was a great suggestion

992
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
It is a little more first person shootery than I'm used to

993
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And I was surprised I couldn't dumb the difficulty

994
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Down because I like to play my shooters in

995
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Easy noob noob mode

996
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
But there is no difficulty

997
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah you gotta hax it though

998
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You gotta hax it

999
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I didn't want to do that

1000
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm doing alright so far

1001
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Multiplayer kicked our butt

1002
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Like because the enemies get so much stronger

1003
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And now it's not just one guy running around

1004
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Not knowing what they're doing it's three

1005
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This is me and two buddies of mine

1006
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
We can certainly play later on

1007
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I know Bobby's got it, Allen's got it now

1008
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Lots of people in the Borderlands

1009
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Otherwise for me I've been playing

1010
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
A lot of the same stuff

1011
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Otherwise not a lot of new new stuff

1012
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This week you know World of Warcraft

1013
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And all that good stuff

1014
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm eagerly awaiting

1015
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Thanks to Loki I got a beta test code

1016
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
For the little big planet karting

1017
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Super excited to try that out

1018
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Play it as quickly as possible because it ends like Wednesday

1019
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh no I'll download it tonight

1020
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Play it Monday and Tuesday night or something

1021
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Let you guys know my impressions on that next week

1022
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That ought to be of interest to the Playstation home folks

1023
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Because that's a Sony exclusive

1024
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
We got some codes that we can give away too

1025
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You say we have extra codes to give away?

1026
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Yeah we do

1027
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Maybe we need to do a giveaway tonight

1028
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
In the Playstation home clubhouse

1029
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That'd be fun

1030
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think like three extra codes

1031
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
We'll think of a way to do a contest

1032
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I don't want to ignore the folks in our live chat room either

1033
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Maybe we'll give some codes away in some different places tonight

1034
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Guess Marissa's cup size is the contest?

1035
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I can guess what it is

1036
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I told you

1037
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't know about that

1038
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Alright

1039
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I gotta keep it

1040
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We might be a mature show

1041
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But I want to keep it somewhat

1042
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
PG-13 at least in home

1043
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Out of respect to the community

1044
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Keep it a little PG-13 there

1045
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Too big is the answer

1046
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Alright

1047
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Shane is messaging me

1048
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Going I want a freaking code

1049
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Well Shane that's what you get for bragging about

1050
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The Playstation all stars

1051
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Network battle

1052
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Royale thingy that you were in the beta for

1053
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And I was like let me play

1054
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You know what his answer was? No

1055
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Alright

1056
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Let's move on

1057
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I think we covered everybody's gaming week

1058
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yes yes yes alright

1059
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Housekeeping

1060
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I want to talk about this

1061
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
This is something a little special

1062
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
No this is serious for a minute

1063
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
A little special and unique on the VoG network

1064
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And I think this is really cool

1065
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And kind of shows some of the different stuff we can do

1066
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So next week after Orange Lounge Radio

1067
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That's right after Orange Lounge Radio

1068
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I think we've been doing this show like 10 years

1069
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Have we ever had another show follow us?

1070
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Like usually we're the last show of the night right?

1071
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Because it's like 1am on the east coast by the time

1072
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
We're done sometimes

1073
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well next week there is going to be a special

1074
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Show following us

1075
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
At VoG network.com

1076
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I know it's very late

1077
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I know it's a long time to stay up

1078
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But this is very cool

1079
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Travis Donovan from Understation Live

1080
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Is going to be doing a special live

1081
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
VoG coverage of the Mars

1082
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
City Landing

1083
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So I think that's really cool

1084
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Like Travis if you listen to

1085
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Understation Live at all which is on Saturday nights

1086
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
At VoG 7 o'clock Pacific

1087
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He loves space

1088
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
He loves NASA he loves the space program

1089
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Is he the best at space?

1090
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
He might be which by the way before I forget

1091
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Rest in peace Sally Ride for real

1092
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Sally Ride

1093
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Not just all the stuff that came out afterwards

1094
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But just Sally Ride

1095
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I was around 5 or 6 when she first went into space

1096
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And I don't

1097
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I don't even know

1098
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
How to put this like at such a young

1099
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Age you're like even so happy

1100
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
To see like a female go

1101
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Into space like

1102
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And you kind of wonder as a kid

1103
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Like on one hand you wonder why is it

1104
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Such a big deal but on the other hand

1105
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You're like you feel like a lot of like happiness

1106
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And pride for kind of like that equality

1107
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I remember feeling that at a young age

1108
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And I'm not even a girl like I guess I was a feminist

1109
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
At 5 years old who knew but

1110
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Anyway Sally Ride

1111
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Amazing inspiration to men and women

1112
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Everywhere

1113
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Out of current events I didn't realize

1114
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
We had set up another

1115
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like

1116
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
That's just a one time special

1117
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
No not that I'm talking about

1118
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Sending something to Mars

1119
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I didn't even realize that we had

1120
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Sent anything else to Mars

1121
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I thought they were like ahhhh

1122
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We fucked up that last rover

1123
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We're done

1124
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I mean that's cool

1125
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Well you know what you should

1126
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Tune in to Travis' special

1127
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Next week you might learn something

1128
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Makes sense that now they have all these Mars landing games

1129
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Like who cares about landing on Mars now

1130
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I mean that's like so old

1131
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And what the hell is the world turning to when I'm learning things

1132
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
From Travis Donovan

1133
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Love you

1134
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Alright

1135
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So I did want to plug that

1136
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Of course I want to plug our Facebook community

1137
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

1138
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We are on Twitter as well

1139
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You can follow us at at OLR

1140
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Or you can follow the voice of geeks network as a whole

1141
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
VOG network

1142
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
VOG network did grow in the past couple weeks

1143
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
With a few new shows

1144
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Critical Myth and British Invaders

1145
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Want to give them a shout out

1146
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Great great television and discussion shows

1147
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They're both fantastic shows

1148
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And so happy to have them on the lineup

1149
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And of course one more shout out

1150
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
To the folks right now doing the running man

1151
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Or just hanging out whatever they're doing

1152
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Playstation Summerfest is going on right now

1153
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Looks like it's thinned out a little bit

1154
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
There was a lot more people in there during Bobby's show

1155
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But you know it's getting late

1156
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
On the east coast

1157
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Some people got to go to bed sometimes

1158
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Alright moving on

1159
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Let's get into some gaming news

1160
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think we're just on the other side of the camera

1161
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh was the camera just facing the wrong way?

1162
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh my god someone made

1163
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A chibi garris plushie

1164
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I see from back here I see it

1165
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Junebug says thank you everyone very much

1166
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Awesome job vog

1167
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Thank you Junebug!

1168
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
She won a $20 gift card during Bobby Black Wolf's show tonight

1169
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
For Playstation Network and she called in

1170
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And I thought that was amazing

1171
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Shout out Junebug

1172
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Loki starting us off tonight

1173
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
With exclusive news

1174
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Maybe?

1175
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I don't have all the details on this yet

1176
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But it was interesting

1177
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It's a test that they're doing

1178
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Apparently it was that new

1179
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Nike Plus

1180
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
A fitness game for Kinect

1181
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That's coming out this fall

1182
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Is going to require a subscription

1183
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Service

1184
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
In order to play the game

1185
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Now I'm not sure exactly how that works

1186
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Because I was asking him some questions

1187
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
He was basically

1188
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
The rep we had at Microsoft

1189
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Was kind of using this

1190
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Hey we can sell some more points cards using this

1191
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm like aren't people going to be kind of pissed off

1192
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That you guys are charging 400 Microsoft points a month

1193
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
For the service

1194
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I guess it's for stat tracking

1195
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And something like that

1196
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Now he said

1197
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Because I don't know too much about this game

1198
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
He said that the game will not work unless you pay

1199
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
This monthly fee

1200
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So I'm not sure what exactly

1201
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Is entailed there

1202
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If it's just going to not track your progress

1203
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
That's what the monthly fee is for

1204
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Or if it's just

1205
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Going to plain straight up not work

1206
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Unless you have like

1207
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
A pass or something

1208
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If you don't pay us

1209
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You will get fat

1210
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I don't know

1211
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
See my thought is

1212
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I was just kind of

1213
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Why

1214
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Why are you guys doing this

1215
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Aren't people going to look at this kind of negative

1216
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Because I even brought up the typical things

1217
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I love that you called him out on it

1218
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You guys

1219
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You have your gold service that people are paying for

1220
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Aren't you guys kind of worried that

1221
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This might look bad

1222
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They're charging a fee

1223
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
On top of this

1224
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
It's just a test right now

1225
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So I don't know

1226
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This is a test

1227
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This is only a test

1228
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's me sucking money out of your wallet

1229
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
We'll have to see what

1230
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We'll have to see what exactly this is

1231
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
When it comes out

1232
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because I'm sure that he didn't have all the details

1233
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Trust me, I know reps for companies

1234
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That don't know what the fuck they're talking about

1235
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
When it comes to product

1236
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And so

1237
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's very possible that he got some stuff wrong

1238
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Or just wasn't clear on things

1239
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Maybe it's just this whole

1240
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Stat tracking thing that's extra

1241
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Or something

1242
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But I still don't like the fact that a game

1243
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Is requiring you for a monthly fee

1244
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
For something that should be

1245
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
In my opinion included with it

1246
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So

1247
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
We will see when this comes out

1248
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And if it does require this

1249
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That kind of sucks for them

1250
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
There's plenty of fitness games out there

1251
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
For the Xbox 360

1252
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This has to be something super special

1253
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The Nike Plus has

1254
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
That whole

1255
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Will it integrate with the shoes?

1256
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's going to integrate with that stuff

1257
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Maybe that's what it is

1258
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't know if Nike Plus

1259
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
As a service

1260
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The one with your shoes

1261
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
If that requires a fee

1262
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Maybe it's something like that

1263
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
All I know is they're saying

1264
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So

1265
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Yep

1266
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Five bucks a month

1267
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I wonder if that will have to be right

1268
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
There on the front of the box

1269
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That they're going to be charging that

1270
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It won't be

1271
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That's scary

1272
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then what are you getting?

1273
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I can see if there's a premium club

1274
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I guess that's no different from Call of Duty

1275
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
That's what it's going to be

1276
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Maybe

1277
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
If you subscribe to this

1278
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And you're out of it

1279
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
That would make sense to me

1280
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It would be a huge mistake

1281
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
To say this game requires

1282
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
All this DLC

1283
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But that's how he phrased it

1284
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Maybe it's just

1285
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Him misinterpreting

1286
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The information he's been given

1287
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
It's possible

1288
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But I'm just reporting

1289
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What I've been told

1290
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
400 Microsoft Points a month

1291
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Some people have mixed success

1292
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Rates with those fitness games

1293
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Brad is talking to me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1294
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Right now and he says

1295
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Talking about fitness games

1296
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Christina got a

1297
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Your shape game

1298
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And while doing one of the initial

1299
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Setup scans it told her

1300
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Straighten your back

1301
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And they cracked up because she has scoliosis

1302
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So her response was

1303
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Good luck with that

1304
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Marissa you're...

1305
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I can imagine Marissa playing

1306
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The Your Shape game

1307
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You seem a little top heavy

1308
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I can't straighten my back either

1309
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I have thighs

1310
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Put down your groceries

1311
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Stop carrying that baby

1312
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Please put down the watermelons

1313
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Please

1314
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'll do ooches braziers later

1315
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Alright

1316
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Anything else on this topic

1317
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Low key or can I move on

1318
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
One more thing I forgot

1319
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
I mentioned this week

1320
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I played Dead or Alive 5

1321
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
The near final build of that

1322
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
That's kind of cool

1323
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
But I don't play Dead or Alive

1324
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
So it was button mash fest

1325
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I didn't do very well with that until I switched to Ryu

1326
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And then I fucking kicked ass

1327
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
He apparently is pretty conducive for button mashing

1328
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It looks pretty though

1329
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Is Dead or Alive

1330
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I made a huge faux pas by the way

1331
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Christina is a girlfriend not a wife

1332
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
My bad

1333
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Awkward

1334
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Sorry guys

1335
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Back and away

1336
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Did I mention what a great show pod culture is

1337
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And you should all listen to it

1338
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So that I can be forgiven

1339
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Monday nights 6 o'clock

1340
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Awkward time at the dinner table

1341
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Rob is red now

1342
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Don't worry it's just like when people say

1343
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So Alan's your roommate?

1344
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Well yeah we do live together

1345
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
In the same room

1346
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And have mating practices

1347
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Alright hey let's move on to Windows 8

1348
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Marissa it's going to turn into the giggle show

1349
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
She's over there making like she's digging a hole

1350
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Let's talk about someone who's almost as awesome as Brad from pod culture

1351
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Gabe Newell

1352
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And he's talking about Windows 8

1353
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
He's not a fan

1354
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You know Windows 8 is coming out towards the end of the year

1355
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I believe it's been a year

1356
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I believe it's been officially dated for October 26

1357
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And it's going to be coming out

1358
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And a lot of people are excited about Windows 8

1359
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But one of them that is not excited about Windows 8

1360
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Gabe Newell

1361
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
He says quote a catastrophe

1362
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
He just straight up called it a catastrophe

1363
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And that's according to all things D

1364
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space

1365
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I think we'll lose some of the top tier PC OEMs

1366
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Who will exit the market

1367
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I think margins will be destroyed

1368
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
For a bunch of people

1369
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
If that's true then it will be good to have alternatives to hedge

1370
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Against that eventually

1371
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
And that is a follow up to Steam being on Linux

1372
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
That is actually

1373
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Now that you kind of hear that

1374
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You're like damn that's genius

1375
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
That's a proactive move by Steam

1376
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Just in case Windows 8 is a gigantic fucking bomb

1377
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
That it turns people off

1378
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
That's a pretty big risk in a way

1379
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I mean I'm sure the Linux folks are happy

1380
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That's crazy that all of a sudden old versions of Windows 8

1381
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Just disappear and become Windows 8

1382
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That is a little interesting but

1383
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I mean gee what's going to happen to all those computers

1384
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Running those older OS's

1385
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And people not upgrading

1386
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh I guess everything will work as usual

1387
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's odd

1388
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Alright

1389
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But hey I guess you know you've got to be prepared

1390
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
For the apocalypse

1391
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I want to come back to what Gabe Newell said in a minute

1392
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Because he said something else

1393
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
That was really fascinating

1394
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And I definitely want Jamie to hear it

1395
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
But in the meantime I want to talk about Blizzard

1396
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You know the makers of World of Warcraft

1397
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
And Starcraft, Diablo

1398
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You might have heard of these games

1399
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
They're kind of big in PC

1400
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Just if you haven't heard

1401
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They have a new game coming out this year

1402
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Pandaria right

1403
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Ok so

1404
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Blizzard is kind of on board with this

1405
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
It was according to Twitter

1406
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And a comment from game designer

1407
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Rob Pardo

1408
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
He said on Twitter

1409
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Nice interview with Gabe Newell

1410
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space

1411
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Not awesome for Blizzard either

1412
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Now keep in mind

1413
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
This is one guy at Blizzard

1414
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
But when he is a game designer

1415
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Yeah

1416
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So there you go

1417
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Not some good early feedback

1418
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I'm hoping this isn't going to go over

1419
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Windows ME or something

1420
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Or Windows Vista

1421
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Even Marista

1422
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
The non-gamer is sitting over there going

1423
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh so cold, so cold

1424
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Wait give Marista the mic

1425
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Marista you are not a fan of Windows ME

1426
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
No I've actually had it in many offices

1427
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I've been the legal secretary

1428
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
At many points in my life

1429
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And attorneys are very cheap

1430
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I've had to try to work with Windows ME

1431
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I still have nightmares

1432
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Alright

1433
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Let me go back to the Gabe Newell thing in a minute

1434
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Alright Jamie listen up

1435
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I know this is software that is a big part

1436
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Of what you do

1437
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Because Gabe Newell kind of alluded

1438
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
To programs like Adobe

1439
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Like Photoshop

1440
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
That causes us to have conversations

1441
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
With Adobe and we say

1442
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
The next version of Photoshop

1443
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Should look like a free to play game

1444
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And they say

1445
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
We have absolutely no idea what you are talking about

1446
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But it sounds really bad

1447
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And what he means by that

1448
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Is that he is saying you know

1449
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
People make money on things like

1450
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Team Fortress

1451
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Team Fortress 2 excuse me that are free to play

1452
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
One steam user apparently making

1453
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
$150,000 a year selling hats

1454
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
In Team Fortress 2

1455
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So he sort of goes to something like Adobe Photoshop

1456
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
And says what if your platform

1457
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Was free

1458
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
But you sold the little bits

1459
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That's at least what I am reading into this

1460
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
You sell the little bits and pieces

1461
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You sell the advanced filters

1462
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And all of that

1463
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
How would you feel if Photoshop looked like that?

1464
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Dark Sakura?

1465
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Well there are other programs that look like that

1466
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And that's why I don't use them

1467
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh really?

1468
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah I mean I could use GIMP

1469
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I love GIMP too

1470
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
But I want what Photoshop does

1471
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So I use Photoshop

1472
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Let's have real talk for a minute

1473
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Aren't there a lot of people that just pirate Photoshop

1474
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I mean isn't that what

1475
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Isn't that what Newell is kind of

1476
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Trying to get at

1477
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Well people are

1478
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Pirating it anyway

1479
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So why don't you just make it free for everybody

1480
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And then add the features

1481
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Because that's not going to work

1482
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
There's plenty of companies that are still going to

1483
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Buy the official ones for their

1484
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Designers

1485
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
At a design firm

1486
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
There are plenty of professionals who are going to have licensed copies

1487
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because they can't produce

1488
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Work for a profit situation

1489
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
If they are using a pirated

1490
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Version

1491
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They have to have licensing

1492
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Even free to play stuff

1493
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Sometimes has that pay tier

1494
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Like a lot of MMOs

1495
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Like Star Trek Online or DC Universe or whatever

1496
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah it's free but then if you pay the monthly fee

1497
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
You get your Uber access or whatever

1498
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah Marisa

1499
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I would be happy to pay

1500
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
If it was a little more reasonable

1501
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
For those of us who aren't using it under a professional capacity

1502
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Well that's what surprised me about

1503
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Windows 8

1504
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
The price, you know a lot of people are shocked about

1505
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Windows 8 price but some people

1506
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Infer that that's coming from the Mac side of things

1507
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Where you know I think the latest Mac upgrade

1508
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Was what 20, 30 bucks

1509
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Don't quote me on that because I don't have a Mac to upgrade

1510
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Right now

1511
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But yeah a lot of people are saying that

1512
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Windows 8 is a cheap upgrade because of that

1513
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So interesting counter move

1514
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I like 7

1515
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
7 does what it needs to do

1516
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And it

1517
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I just think that

1518
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And this is the whole reason why more and more

1519
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
People you know basically are leaving

1520
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The PC and Mac universe to

1521
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Head over to Linux because they want

1522
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
To have the control over what they install

1523
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
In their systems like I love

1524
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Linux because if I want my

1525
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
System to be optimized for graphics

1526
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Over like say sound

1527
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
All I have to do is install a new kernel

1528
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
That's optimized for graphics

1529
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Done

1530
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Or optimized for system speed

1531
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Done. I can switch between the two

1532
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
If I want to

1533
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You know I have all of my programs

1534
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I can download them through one place

1535
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Yes but they've been tested and

1536
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Worked for my system I can still

1537
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Go through other means to download the programs

1538
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
That I want. I love Linux

1539
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I'm running Linux Mint right now

1540
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
On my netbook which

1541
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
You know was half the size of the Windows

1542
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Install that came on it

1543
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And it uses I think

1544
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
A third of the memory resources

1545
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
That Windows does

1546
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But is it efficient for porn?

1547
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yes I can watch porn on it

1548
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
He's efficient for porn

1549
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Hey porno box I love you Linux

1550
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I just got done

1551
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Looking up a bunch of mass effect porn

1552
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I mean

1553
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You mean deviantart research

1554
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Whatever

1555
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I'm

1556
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm doing

1557
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Work

1558
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
If a computer from

1559
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Back in the 90's is efficient for porn

1560
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Which mine was

1561
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
They're slow let's be real

1562
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
A netbook can easily look up porn

1563
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I mean Loki I know you were the kid

1564
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Like me who dialed into all the BBS's

1565
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
To download porn? It took time

1566
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
That was dedication because if that picture

1567
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Because if that picture

1568
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Sucked then oh my god

1569
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You've just wasted a good like

1570
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
30 minutes

1571
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And we were thankful back in my day

1572
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Pornography

1573
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Was logging onto the local

1574
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
BBS to see Snow White

1575
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Gangbanged by seven dwarves

1576
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Animated gifs

1577
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
They

1578
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Weren't even animated it was just

1579
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
A regular gif

1580
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And you what you know what

1581
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You were lucky if it was in 256

1582
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Colors because look at those boobies

1583
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
In 16 colors and you'll like it

1584
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Two miles uphill in the snow

1585
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Go find an old abandonware

1586
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Archive somewhere and download an old

1587
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
School strip poker game from like 1984

1588
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
For what was called

1589
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Now kids I know you might not have heard of this

1590
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But for what's called a CGA monitor

1591
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Does anybody know

1592
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
What a CGA monitor does

1593
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And then we had EGA

1594
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Okay I have a dirty

1595
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Porn story

1596
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
My favorite

1597
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Safe for your audience though but it's funny that you mention

1598
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That you know with you know with the

1599
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Internet and internet pornography it's amazing

1600
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Actually how much of a backlog

1601
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And you know things that run on VHS

1602
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That are on the internet I found out

1603
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That a friend of mine

1604
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Had a

1605
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
A gentleman had done

1606
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Porn and

1607
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I was there for this this was funny

1608
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
She found out while she was here

1609
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah and um

1610
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The Wii came out

1611
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah and um

1612
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Now I understand why when we were doing

1613
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
The whole cute little like find out your porn star

1614
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Name game now I understand why he thought that game

1615
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Was so funny

1616
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Now I understand like he didn't

1617
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah well I managed to

1618
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Look it up and uh

1619
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I found it it was like 94

1620
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I also found out that he hadn't changed his

1621
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Comforter and I had house sat for him once

1622
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And I was grossed out

1623
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Because they shot it at his house

1624
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Did you run and take a shower immediately?

1625
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yes

1626
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
He had a chair it was just so comfort

1627
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I slept in the bed I was watching his house

1628
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And I took a screenshot of his own face

1629
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And I sent it to all his friends

1630
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Wow

1631
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That is a cunty thing to do

1632
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh my god

1633
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I'm sorry if that word offends you

1634
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Alright I didn't want to go there

1635
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That is like drag queen level

1636
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
See you next Tuesday

1637
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
That would be the truth

1638
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But the problem was Rob

1639
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You sent a picture of his own face to all of his friends

1640
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I had dated him

1641
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And he did not tell me

1642
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Okay

1643
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I didn't want to

1644
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
I didn't want to have to make that confession

1645
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
But yes

1646
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I have fucked a porn star

1647
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Congratulations

1648
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yay

1649
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The things we learned on Orange Lounge Radio

1650
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
In retrospect his technique

1651
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Makes a lot more sense now

1652
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Now I look back

1653
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Oh

1654
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
By technique meaning

1655
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That he uses the same techniques that butchers use

1656
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
For like tenderizing meats

1657
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Or perhaps that you're like

1658
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Man were you like a butter churner

1659
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
In your past life or something

1660
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I just want to give another hello to the Playstation

1661
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Homers joining us for the first time

1662
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
At the Voice of Geeks Network

1663
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
These are the things geeks have to say

1664
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Who knew? Well you know what

1665
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
There's a comment coming from Playstation Home

1666
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
From Manda Panda 1979

1667
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Snow White banging the seven dwarves

1668
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Hot!

1669
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It really wasn't that hot

1670
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But yet we were 13 and loved it

1671
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
One of the days of the pornos he was in

1672
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Was called Country Western Cuties

1673
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Nude pie eating contest

1674
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And he

1675
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And he

1676
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Bob is on the floor literally

1677
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
He was actually

1678
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
A country singer songwriter

1679
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
That's how I knew him

1680
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay for the record

1681
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I had just broken up with my boyfriend

1682
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
It was a very dark time for me

1683
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And now I

1684
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So how about video games?

1685
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
That email actually said to all my friends

1686
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Had said I have a present for you

1687
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
And I had the

1688
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Screen cap of Zo face and in

1689
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Porny font it said you're welcome

1690
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It's a pie eating contest

1691
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm

1692
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
So sorry

1693
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh yeah and by the way I actually had asked

1694
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
A bunch of my friends to tune in

1695
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
This evening

1696
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Who were not aware of the story

1697
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So now they know a lot more about me

1698
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Than I never cared to have them know

1699
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
I'm surprised that that's the title of it

1700
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That's actually pretty

1701
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know

1702
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It's not bad for a porn title

1703
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I mean there's

1704
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
No we're talking like actual pies

1705
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And not like pies in the

1706
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Pornographic sense

1707
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That's where my mind went

1708
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I've been literally rolling on the floor laughing

1709
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So hard

1710
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You're welcome

1711
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I apologize

1712
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'd like to take this moment to apologize

1713
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Can we get to the games please?

1714
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Maybe

1715
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Chigurh says

1716
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
That I'm going all Anderson Cooper right now

1717
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Rob was

1718
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Literally on the floor

1719
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know what's funny is I had some people

1720
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Come up to you during the game summit thing

1721
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That we had at our work and everything

1722
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And they're like hey so I have some libraries

1723
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And stuff that might be interesting in podcast

1724
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And I'm like did you realize this is a pretty adult podcast

1725
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Like we use some colorful languages

1726
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And they're like yeah that's okay

1727
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Are you sure you know what you're getting into?

1728
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Well if Catcher in the Rye is at the library

1729
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I mean

1730
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
They're not my customers

1731
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Okay

1732
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1733
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Says I'm so glad this is

1734
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
The OLR live I get to

1735
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Come back to after so much time away

1736
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Please don't put this on the wiki

1737
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Somehow

1738
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Windows 8 led to that

1739
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Discussion

1740
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
To register

1741
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Participation for this week's episode of Orange

1742
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com

1743
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Use the passphrase

1744
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Olive

1745
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
So DarkSakura

1746
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Why don't you try to bring us back to games

1747
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Here with another story

1748
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
More porn please

1749
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
No not that

1750
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Square

1751
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Is saying that

1752
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Versus 13

1753
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Is going to still be out

1754
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And they still are not showing shit about it

1755
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
But they are watching porn

1756
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
No

1757
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
There was basically

1758
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
A statement by

1759
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Yoichi Wada saying that

1760
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Someone was spreading a rumor about Versus being

1761
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Cancelled

1762
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
They said that he just left a regularly scheduled

1763
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Meeting for Versus and quote says

1764
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
If you were to see

1765
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
The city

1766
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Etc presented today

1767
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
You wouldn't be able to stand

1768
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
From surprise

1769
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Because everybody thinks the game is dead

1770
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Yeah

1771
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Could it be though I mean okay

1772
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Cancelled but weren't there a lot of

1773
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You know kind of rumor I mean granted this is

1774
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
All rumors or whatever that it could be a different

1775
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Name now

1776
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't know they just said that they're still

1777
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Running it under the luminous engine

1778
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Well I know that's a lot of what we talked about because when the story

1779
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Came up last week we were here but

1780
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We hypothesized

1781
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
It doesn't say anything about it

1782
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Final Fantasy 13 a sequel

1783
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Reborn

1784
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I see what you did there

1785
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
We'll come back to that

1786
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Dark Sakura what do you think of Final Fantasy 13

1787
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Versus does it look like something you play?

1788
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Given that I didn't play the first 13 more than

1789
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The level then I kind of

1790
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I'm not interested in it

1791
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Well keep in mind Versus is more Kingdom Hearts ish

1792
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
In the way it plays then I play Kingdom Hearts

1793
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I mean seriously

1794
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm kind of spent on the Final Fantasy

1795
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Franchise I kind of don't care

1796
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
About it anymore

1797
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
14 didn't help but we'll get back to that later

1798
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I didn't play 12

1799
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I tried to play 13 and I thought it wasn't

1800
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Great and I'm really not

1801
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Invested in the universe so

1802
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I think honestly between

1803
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
13 and 13

1804
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Versus is pretty much just like

1805
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Joel Schumacher Batman and

1806
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You know

1807
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
A different Batman Final Fantasy 14

1808
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Was kind of the Batman and Robin of the series

1809
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Right now it's kind of like

1810
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
We had to hire

1811
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Who's like a big

1812
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
We had to hire Steven Spielberg to redo

1813
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Batman and Robin like that's what's going

1814
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
On in Final Fantasy 14 right now

1815
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Alright let's move on with

1816
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Some more news while I get a drink of water

1817
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Because my face still hurts from laughing so hard

1818
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Damn you Marissa this is why

1819
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You haven't been on this show because you kill me

1820
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Every time

1821
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I'm trying to take

1822
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm on the Facebook app right now

1823
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm trying to take down the leak I sent all my friends

1824
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Inviting them to listen in

1825
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Not all of them knew that

1826
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's okay though it is funny

1827
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I love you so much right now

1828
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I can't even

1829
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Alright so what was his porn star name?

1830
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
No

1831
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Everybody's gonna

1832
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Google it now

1833
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Let's move on

1834
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Games, video games, gaming culture

1835
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's what we do here at O.L.R.

1836
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Alright

1837
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So let's talk about Ouya

1838
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Ouya is that you know

1839
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Wonderful 99 dollar console that's being

1840
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Created through Kickstarter of course

1841
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And they made some announcements

1842
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Including that the streaming service

1843
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
OnLive will be coming to the system

1844
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
As well, not a big surprise since

1845
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
OnLive runs on Android and it's an Android

1846
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Device so it makes sense to me

1847
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That it would be on there

1848
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But of course OnLive has been

1849
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
They committed that they will deliver a full console class

1850
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Experience and bring hundreds

1851
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Of top tier games for more than

1852
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
80 publishers, more marketing speak

1853
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Marketing speak, marketing speak

1854
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And then of course at the same time

1855
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
They also showed the second half of that

1856
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Concept picture for

1857
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
The Ouya controller and

1858
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah looks like the second half of the controller

1859
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
What do you expect

1860
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And of course everyone's like oh I don't like that d-pad

1861
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Well everything's still not finalized

1862
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's just a concept picture

1863
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But now you have your second half and wow

1864
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It looks like what you thought it would look like

1865
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
The Ouya, the OnLive

1866
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Everything is a really interesting back door

1867
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
To get the big games on

1868
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Ouya because you remember a couple

1869
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Of weeks ago we were you know kind of having our

1870
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Skepticism chat about should we fund

1871
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
This or not and we were talking about

1872
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
You know how they're doing this poll to see what

1873
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Games people want on Ouya and it's all this

1874
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
First party stuff is what people really want

1875
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
It's like dude this box is not going to be powerful enough

1876
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
To run you know Mass Effect 3

1877
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Or something like that but

1878
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Thanks to OnLive technology

1879
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
I mean you could play Assassin's Creed

1880
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Or you know whatever the games are

1881
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That are on Ouya

1882
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Borderlands is one of them I know that

1883
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I don't believe

1884
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
A publisher can say

1885
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
No we don't want our game pushed to

1886
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Such and such I don't think

1887
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Yeah so that is

1888
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I gotta say that's a really

1889
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Smart partnership

1890
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Because you're using a technology

1891
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That's gonna be able to

1892
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You're using

1893
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
A technology that your system can accommodate

1894
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
To kind of use those

1895
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Big games and I think that's a

1896
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Really brilliant idea on their part

1897
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yeah and then of course

1898
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I think we may have mentioned this last week

1899
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That they're getting the prequel to

1900
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The human element

1901
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Is gonna be an exclusive thing on there

1902
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Considering that that game doesn't come out in 2015

1903
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I don't even know how

1904
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Why would you even announce a game that's gonna come out that far

1905
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
From now I mean

1906
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Cool you got a game coming out in 2015

1907
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I won't remember by the time I get to 2015

1908
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Tigerclaw in our chatroom

1909
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
At live.vognetwork.com

1910
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Who earlier told me they were

1911
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Feeling ignored because of all the

1912
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Attention I'm giving the Playstation home tonight

1913
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'd love you guys too

1914
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
At the regular chatroom live.vognetwork.com

1915
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Tigerclaw says

1916
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
On live is on Android

1917
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
So it coming to Ouya was a no brainer

1918
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Well if you said that last week

1919
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Tigerclaw you would really look like a

1920
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Games analyst but now

1921
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I mean

1922
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm not surprised because even if

1923
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It wasn't on there they could have easily

1924
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Just you know side loaded it

1925
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
On there and game guru reminds us

1926
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
On live already has

1927
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
A set top box you know so it's

1928
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Already available out there

1929
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
True I think their set top box is like 50 bucks

1930
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Too but at least

1931
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
This you'll get a set top box that'll

1932
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Do that and other

1933
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Things it'd be cool

1934
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
If it's compatible with the on live controllers

1935
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I'm hoping that it's going to be compatible

1936
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
With any bluetooth controller because then

1937
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I can use my PS3 controller

1938
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Which isn't getting a whole ton of use right now

1939
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Except for

1940
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
You know browsing porn

1941
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
On the PS3

1942
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
What else do we use

1943
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Our devices for alright

1944
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Before I get into the next story I have some

1945
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I'm sorry home this is

1946
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
These comments are a little bit delayed

1947
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But I think you can tell what segment of the show

1948
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
These comments are from

1949
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
PSV J style

1950
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
In the Playstation home

1951
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Chat room Aurora 1.5 space

1952
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Tonight during summer fest says

1953
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Are you listening to this

1954
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
LOL and

1955
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Fizz Liz says giggle time

1956
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So apparently

1957
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Now it's the running man and giggle fits

1958
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
In Playstation home summer fest

1959
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Awesome

1960
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Are you going to do the Carlton next?

1961
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I don't think the Carlton is one of the

1962
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Dances it might be

1963
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You know what's great

1964
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Tangent time you ready for a

1965
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Random rob tangent

1966
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
They upgraded the lotus notes system

1967
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
At my work yes my work is one of the few

1968
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
That uses lotus notes as opposed to

1969
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Outlook the other one right

1970
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So we use lotus notes and one of the huge new

1971
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Features is

1972
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Customizable emote icons

1973
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So now when you do the

1974
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Instant message you can have like your own emote icons

1975
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And one of the most popular ones right

1976
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Now that has been passed around

1977
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
At the work place that we send to each other

1978
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Is the Carlton gift

1979
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
When something goes well

1980
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You can add any animated gift

1981
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
To the emote icon system which is amazing

1982
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Please tell me you added the table flipping or something

1983
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I don't have a table flipping

1984
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But I have a cat jumping out a window

1985
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
It looks

1986
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It's a safe cat don't worry

1987
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It looks like a great distance but it's not

1988
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's just like jumping into the backyard or something

1989
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But it's funny

1990
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Some things

1991
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Coming to

1992
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I feel bad that on the Sony Playstation home night

1993
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
We have all this Microsoft news but

1994
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
We do have some Sony news coming up a little later

1995
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But

1996
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
This is an interesting experience on the Xbox

1997
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
360

1998
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
There's some new TV experiences

1999
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Coming later this year

2000
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
They are Connect Sesame Street

2001
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
TV not to be confused

2002
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
With the game that already came out

2003
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And Connect National Geographic

2004
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
TV which I think they're just calling

2005
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Nat Geo because I guess that's what the hip kids call it

2006
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Nat Geo

2007
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Alright

2008
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
They will be $29.99

2009
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That's 2400 Microsoft

2010
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Points for 8

2011
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
30 minute episodes

2012
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Apparently they are interactive

2013
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
TV shows though

2014
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
They will be available at retail

2015
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
And Xbox Live under the

2016
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Season Pass

2017
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't know how the interactive

2018
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Episode works but I imagine maybe you will like

2019
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Sesame Street like they count along

2020
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
You interact with Connect stuff

2021
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Like Elmo will tell you

2022
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Hey toss me my

2023
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Teddy bear and you make the motion like you're tossing

2024
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
The teddy bear and if you don't it will

2025
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Still play on as well

2026
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
It's like optional

2027
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I gotta say if I had kids that

2028
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Does sound pretty rad

2029
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Have you thought about something like this for Josh?

2030
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I've definitely thought about it

2031
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I may pick it up

2032
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
How does Nat Geo work?

2033
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
You point to

2034
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I want to see the topless natives point

2035
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I think it's animals

2036
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Not topless natives

2037
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It's more like

2038
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Can you spot the

2039
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Giraffe or something like that

2040
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Given a thing you have to find

2041
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I found it right there

2042
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Trivia and stuff like that

2043
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The other thing too is those are also

2044
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Rentable

2045
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I was going to get to that

2046
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
For five bucks

2047
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
That's 400 Microsoft points

2048
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
September 18th is when this all starts

2049
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That's the purchase

2050
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Renting them is 240 Microsoft points

2051
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Each

2052
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
That might be worth checking out

2053
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
You should definitely put Josh

2054
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
To the test there and see if it happens

2055
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It's hard to say

2056
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
He probably won't know what to do

2057
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
He's still a little young

2058
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
If they tell him jump up and down

2059
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Sing a song

2060
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Sit there and eat a cracker

2061
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
He's like no

2062
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I'm not going to do that

2063
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Skullking in

2064
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
PlayStation Home says

2065
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Will this Sesame Street game be like Dora the

2066
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Explorer? If so I'm down

2067
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
That's kind of how

2068
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That show works

2069
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
A little bit

2070
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
But it's for real

2071
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Maybe that will be the next thing that comes to connect

2072
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
If these do well

2073
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It's all about how well these do

2074
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
As iconic as it is

2075
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I imagine it's got to be pretty cheap

2076
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
To reduce

2077
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Since this is all PBS programming

2078
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Fuck Dora the Explorer

2079
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
She's on Nickelodeon

2080
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
You know what it's all about?

2081
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Fucking Carmen Sandiego

2082
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Ghost writer on there

2083
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
No

2084
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
No

2085
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Reading Rainbow

2086
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I want LeVar Burton

2087
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
To read to me on my

2088
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
360 and that sexy sexy voice

2089
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Ah PBS

2090
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Mr. Rogers neighborhood

2091
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I know Mr. Rogers is long gone

2092
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Maybe a live interaction with King Friday

2093
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And what was that lady's

2094
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
name? She was kind of a bitch

2095
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
The lady that had the

2096
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
museum or something, the carousel

2097
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yeah you lost me

2098
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Somebody with me here, come on

2099
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
That's Sharon Lewis and Bram's elephant show

2100
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
We were listening to the theme song

2101
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
yesterday

2102
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Two elephants went out to

2103
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
play upon a

2104
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
spider's web one day

2105
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And

2106
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
where the hell is my god damn

2107
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Bob Ross painting game that I was promised

2108
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
at the launch of the Wii

2109
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Huh? Please tell me you heard that new

2110
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Bob Ross remix Yeah it was alright

2111
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
It's nice

2112
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Alright

2113
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Lady Elaine, thank you DJ Morpheus

2114
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I knew somebody in chat

2115
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
would know it Lady Jane

2116
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Frisbee gives the full name

2117
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Lady Elaine Fairchild

2118
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
That was it Lady Fairchild

2119
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
She was

2120
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
kind of a bitch

2121
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
What do you want?

2122
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
In the land of make believe

2123
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I would give a fuck

2124
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Make believe I'm gonna kick your ass

2125
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I made believe you weren't talking to me

2126
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Hold on sorry dead air but I'm trying to look

2127
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
up right now on

2128
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
the YouTubes

2129
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
If I can get a clip here

2130
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Oh fuck yes here we go

2131
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh damn it that's like a song or something

2132
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
That's a creepy puppet is what that is

2133
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
It had a picture on it but

2134
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Is she a creepy puppet?

2135
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
She was a creepy puppet

2136
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Alright forget it

2137
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Although maybe if that pop song is any good

2138
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I can put that in a vog network rotation

2139
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Anyhow let's move on with some more stories

2140
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Dark Sakura

2141
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Well how

2142
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
about a survival

2143
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
game called Pulse

2144
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
It's free and it was put out

2145
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
by the Vancouver film school

2146
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Well because you know students

2147
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
student work has often played

2148
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
into many a modern video

2149
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
game like

2150
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Portal

2151
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
You know

2152
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Anyway this game called Pulse

2153
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
is a first person survival suspense

2154
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
game so you play as a blind

2155
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
girl who has to go through

2156
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
a cave by throwing around

2157
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
four sprites

2158
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Splat!

2159
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Splat!

2160
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And the sounds

2161
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
they make help her see the world

2162
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
around her kind of you know daredevil like

2163
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
So she has sonar

2164
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
She has sonar by throwing fairies into the wall

2165
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I like that

2166
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And it's done by Pixel

2167
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Pie Team and it's

2168
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
very artsy, colorful

2169
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
cartoony

2170
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
but it's very very grim

2171
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and actually

2172
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
they want to

2173
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
expand it beyond the free version

2174
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
but for now I think

2175
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
if you want to get it you can go to their

2176
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
official site

2177
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
which is Team Pixel Pie

2178
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
as in 3.14

2179
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
.com

2180
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm going to get it when I get home

2181
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Very cool, I'm glad these students

2182
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
had time to produce this you know

2183
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
And the site is really pretty

2184
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I love the color scheme in this

2185
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
It really is just very

2186
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
different

2187
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Well congrats to the folks at the very original school

2188
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Well there's another one too

2189
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
There's one called the Mask of Key QI

2190
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
which is a third person platformer

2191
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
that has a master flying squirrel

2192
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
and it's done by

2193
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Team Kronk and it's another

2194
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
freebie

2195
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Alright let's travel around the world

2196
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
and check out release dates of some more

2197
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
traditional retail games coming to a store

2198
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
near you this week. Loki?

2199
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Not a lot of big things but

2200
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
a couple big games that you'll probably be interested in

2201
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
starting off with Risen 2

2202
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Dark Waters on Playstation 3

2203
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Xbox 360

2204
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
and I believe PC

2205
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and then for 3DS owners

2206
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
finally getting your copy of

2207
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance

2208
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
in 3D

2209
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
on 3DS

2210
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
You don't say? Yes I do say

2211
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and

2212
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I think that's pretty much it

2213
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I mean at least those are the big ones this week

2214
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Well the Kingdom Hearts game is kind of a big deal

2215
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
so that's cool

2216
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Yeah that'd be it

2217
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Let's travel- Oh Grow Lancers

2218
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Grow Lancers way far over time

2219
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Forgot the Atlas PSP title

2220
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Alright moving to Japan

2221
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
and checking out the release dates over there

2222
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
The Idolmaster 2 gets a price

2223
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
reduction this week on the Xbox 360

2224
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
That's not a new release but

2225
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
if you like to save money that will be going

2226
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
into effect this week. On the Playstation 3

2227
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
things are a little more exciting

2228
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
when you have Tales of Vesperia also

2229
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
getting a price reduction and

2230
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Tales of Graces F also

2231
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
getting a price reduction and

2232
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Troy Musu getting a

2233
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
price reduction as well as Idolmaster

2234
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
2. There's lots of price reductions. Oh

2235
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Battlefield Bad Company 2

2236
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's like a Playstation 3 sale but

2237
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
sadly no new games to report on either of those

2238
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
systems this week in Japan

2239
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Looking at the Playstation Vita

2240
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
there is a game called Momo

2241
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Daisensu Gen Daiban

2242
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
comes out this week in a regular

2243
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and premium edition that's a game on

2244
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
the Vita. I don't know if that's

2245
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
based off an anime or what

2246
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
but it's from SystemSoft and

2247
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
it kind of looks like these

2248
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I don't know, one chick kind of looks like an army girl

2249
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
and another kind of looks like Sailor Moon-ish

2250
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
but she's got like a microphone

2251
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
so I'm not sure what this game is all about

2252
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
there is no description

2253
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
about if it's based off a series

2254
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
or what have you. I have to randomly add

2255
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
that Chris always compliments your Japanese

2256
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
pronunciation. He's always

2257
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
impressed by it. Don't listen to early

2258
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
episodes of the show because it was a hot

2259
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
mess. Never had a class

2260
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Well I did have Jamie sitting over here

2261
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
to slap me on the back of the head when I'd get one wrong

2262
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I can't do it right now. You put the embosses

2263
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
in the wrong syllable

2264
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
On the 3DS this

2265
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
week, more exciting

2266
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
games like Smile Pre-Cure

2267
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Let's Go Marching World

2268
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
that's what it's called. Madagascar 3

2269
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
and Wan Nyan

2270
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Dobutsu Buyan 2

2271
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Sorry that's not a Nyan

2272
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
cat game, it just happens to have that in the name

2273
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
but there is a cat and a dog in it

2274
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I think it's like a pet dog

2275
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Wan Nyan

2276
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Midnight Maximum Tune

2277
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
or something like that

2278
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
A crazy drift racing

2279
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Nyan cat

2280
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Starring Tunes is the driving cat

2281
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
This actually looks

2282
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
super cute. It looks like a pet

2283
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
hospital kind of game because the front cover

2284
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
has all this guy

2285
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
and ladies in lab long white

2286
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
coats that you'd see veterinarians wear

2287
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and it's all kitties and puppies

2288
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
and that guy in the back

2289
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Oh my god this is perfect

2290
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Shane if you're listening you need to see this

2291
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Dude in the back with blue hair holding a corgi

2292
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
That's like

2293
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It's Shane personified right there

2294
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I'm going to send him a link to this in case he's listening

2295
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Alright

2296
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Moving on

2297
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I'm sorry I'm busy calibrating

2298
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Who are you? Garris?

2299
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Let's do UK releases

2300
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Okay well in the UK

2301
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm going to have to reload the page but on the 30th

2302
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
we have Orcs Must Die

2303
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
and now I have to go back

2304
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
to the top of the page and load it next month

2305
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
So

2306
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
They freaking changed how

2307
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
their things work so whatever

2308
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Um

2309
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Where's fucking August

2310
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Fuck. Okay August

2311
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I can't help it

2312
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Stop judging me

2313
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Okay on August 1st

2314
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Deadlight and Puddle

2315
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
On August 3rd Risen 2

2316
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Dark Waters and then that's all and if there's anything else

2317
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I don't care

2318
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Sorry

2319
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
folks overseas but Dark Soccer doesn't

2320
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
care. No that's all that

2321
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Eurogamer told me there was

2322
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Alright a couple more news stories

2323
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I couldn't be bothered

2324
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
A couple more news stories for you guys and then

2325
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
the classic game of the week we're going to take a trip down

2326
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
memory lane and revisit a game from the past

2327
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
that you should check out

2328
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
because Dark Soccer told you to

2329
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
but first a couple more news stories

2330
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
In this case because Dan told me to tell you to

2331
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Okay. Alright so apparently GameStop

2332
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
CEO Paul Rains

2333
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
He made a comment regarding

2334
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
the possibility of a used

2335
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
digital

2336
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
downloads

2337
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
format. Basically

2338
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
the whole

2339
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
lawsuit that happened in the UK

2340
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
kind of set an interest

2341
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
well it didn't really set a precedent but it was interesting

2342
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
that they kind of favored

2343
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
towards that that you should be able to get

2344
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
refunds for used games

2345
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
when you're done using them

2346
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Basically calling and saying

2347
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
interesting. It's not a

2348
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
meaningful business yet

2349
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Right now we're not seeing

2350
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
that as a huge market but I think

2351
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
we're on the leading edge. There are a few companies

2352
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
a few startups out there that we

2353
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
talked to that are doing this

2354
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
and of course they just purchased

2355
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Impulse which is

2356
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
originally from Stardock

2357
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
and they kind of have a similar service

2358
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
on there where you can

2359
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
use it as

2360
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
goo to create used

2361
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
PC licenses for different

2362
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
games

2363
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
and they say no we don't see

2364
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
a lot of interest in the model from our publishing

2365
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
partners

2366
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but definitely something

2367
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
that they're interested in looking at when

2368
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
that time comes. I guess it makes sense

2369
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
if everything is going to go digital and stuff

2370
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
and they do eventually have a

2371
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
way to revoke licenses which would be

2372
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
pretty cool. I mean especially some of the

2373
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
stuff I have on like steam

2374
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
and stuff if I could sell some of the

2375
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
things that you know I'm not playing

2376
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
and I got in some of these indie bundles that would be

2377
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
kind of cool

2378
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
to trade it in for

2379
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
other things

2380
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
but of course you know if it

2381
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
has anything to do with used game sales they're probably

2382
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
all over it. Do you think this could

2383
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
work? It could work but

2384
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
it involves all the

2385
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
publishers having to agree on that kind of thing and that's

2386
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
kind of basically green to

2387
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
having a used marketplace and isn't

2388
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
that what they're kind of trying to get rid of already

2389
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
so that's

2390
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I don't think that this is ever

2391
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
going to

2392
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
hit full force

2393
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
anytime soon. There's a part

2394
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
of me that thinks a system like

2395
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
this is just begging to be hacked

2396
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
like I kind of

2397
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
think they might try to implement well then again

2398
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
I don't know steam works alright like

2399
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
they haven't been able to hack steam right

2400
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
but I don't know something like this

2401
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
just seems like

2402
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
it's begging to be worked around

2403
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
there's ways to hack game not that I'm saying

2404
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
you should do it but it definitely is one of the

2405
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
things that's got to be giving publishers pause

2406
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I just think a lot of these systems are

2407
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
going to be closed and then the

2408
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
other thing too is like say I

2409
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
have a PS3 game or something like that and I want

2410
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
to trade my digital copy in for something

2411
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
what if I want to get a 360 game with that

2412
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
or am I going to be able to do that? The system is going to be

2413
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
separate and you have different rules I mean there's a whole

2414
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
lot of things going in

2415
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
going on there and it's just

2416
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
that's probably why this isn't

2417
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
they're trying to get rid of used game sales they're not

2418
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
going to try to all of a sudden say hey

2419
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
yeah we're going to go digital but we're

2420
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
bringing used games back that's not going to happen

2421
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I mean come on they're doing this to get people

2422
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
to buy new games in the first place

2423
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
they're not going to all of a sudden

2424
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
flip a 180 and just say hey

2425
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
by the way used games are awesome

2426
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
no it's not going to happen

2427
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
alright one more story for you guys here

2428
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
before the classic game of the week and it has to do

2429
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
with Final Fantasy 14

2430
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
yes we do want to do a little

2431
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
reporting on Final Fantasy 14 because

2432
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
you know very interesting

2433
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
MMO this is a I mean

2434
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
it wasn't that great when it came out

2435
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
let's be real if you played it on PC especially

2436
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
when it first came out it was a really

2437
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
crap game there have been

2438
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
improvements since it first launched

2439
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and they're promising even more before

2440
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
the big launch on Playstation 3

2441
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
later this year well they now

2442
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
are officially calling it

2443
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Final Fantasy 14

2444
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
A Realm Reborn that is

2445
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
the version 2.0 of the game

2446
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
that's going to be coming out later this year

2447
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I don't think it's coming out later this year

2448
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
oh really? yeah

2449
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I have a TBA 2013

2450
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
date right now for it really

2451
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
well they did put out a trailer

2452
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
this week I haven't even watched this

2453
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
trailer yet but I'm told there's no

2454
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
gameplay in it it's just CGI

2455
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
really Final Fantasy trailer no gameplay

2456
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
in it I know right but color me shocked

2457
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
apparently a lot of this has to do

2458
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
with like

2459
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
it's basically Final Fantasy

2460
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
14 Cataclysm to put

2461
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I mean look you can see we're watching

2462
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
the trailer here and you can probably hear a little bit of the audio

2463
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
coming through the feed but we're

2464
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
looking at you know missiles flying from the

2465
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
sky and basically destroying

2466
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
things you see all these like warriors

2467
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
suiting up and putting up shields but it's

2468
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
very obvious the world is being hit

2469
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
so that tells me that's their

2470
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
you know just like they did in World of Warcraft

2471
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
that's their way to

2472
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
change the look of the world and so

2473
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
forth but I gotta say you know

2474
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
the CGI heavy or not

2475
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
it looks great

2476
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
of course the original trailer for 14 looked

2477
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
awesome I remember that original

2478
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
trailer at E3 gave me chills

2479
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
just because I spent so many years with

2480
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Final Fantasy 11 I was like legit that

2481
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
excited and then when I played the game

2482
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I had different type of chills so cold

2483
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
so cold it's so bad

2484
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
why is this allowed to be released

2485
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
he touched me in a dirty place

2486
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
but see that looks pretty rad doesn't it

2487
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I don't know

2488
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I'm just looking here at the end I'm trying to see if there's actually a date

2489
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
nope coming soon

2490
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I don't have a date coming soon to PlayStation 3

2491
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
and PC December 31st

2492
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
2013 is what the placeholder

2493
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
date is right now which means

2494
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
TVA 2013

2495
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
if it's TVA 2012 then yeah maybe later this year

2496
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Akuma JP

2497
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
says Meteo maybe

2498
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
that's a reference to what you might be seeing

2499
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
there in the trailer very interesting thought

2500
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Monty Boggs says Final Fantasy

2501
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
the new 52

2502
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
in parentheses online players

2503
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
via PlayStation 3

2504
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I see what you did there

2505
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
yeah Akuma JP is putting it

2506
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
together saying there's a red meteor in the sky

2507
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
so he thinks it's gonna involve Meteo

2508
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I gotta say

2509
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Final Fantasy 14 at least the look of it

2510
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
fits in very well with the series

2511
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
it's just kinda you know

2512
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
the game was kinda crap

2513
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Final Fantasy 11

2514
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
a game report into Final Fantasy

2515
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
version 2

2516
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
alright look let's take a step

2517
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
back to a time when games are a lot more simple

2518
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
they weren't so flashy

2519
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
there was no CGI trailer for this game

2520
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
we're about to talk about and if there had been

2521
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
it would have been all kinds of awesome

2522
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Dark Sakura

2523
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
is gonna step into the vault as she always

2524
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
does and she'll go

2525
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
this is crunchy

2526
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
and this will say Dan

2527
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
game

2528
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
and get a classic game of the week

2529
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
suggestion Dark Sakura what is this

2530
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
classic game of the week? Roadblasters

2531
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
good pick

2532
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
yeah I know

2533
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
it's an arcade game that came out by Atari

2534
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
games in 1987

2535
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
when I was still in

2536
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
middle school

2537
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
basically

2538
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
it is a game where you drive

2539
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
a sports car through 50 different

2540
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
rally races and you have to get to the end

2541
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
without running out of fuel

2542
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
so you have to complete all 50 of those

2543
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
races

2544
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
you can basically have as many vehicles

2545
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
as you want to complete the rally

2546
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
but you have to have gas

2547
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
in the arcade

2548
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
the Sega

2549
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
and the Lynx version

2550
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
you could start the game

2551
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
at a higher rally and get more

2552
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
opportunities to jump levels

2553
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
and you can continue the game from where

2554
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
you left off but you only have

2555
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
one chance to complete the 50th and

2556
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
final rally

2557
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
so you have four ways that you can get in this game

2558
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
by green globes, red globes, a checkpoint

2559
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
and the rally point

2560
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
green globes are on the road and they fill

2561
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
your main tank, red globes

2562
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
are getting by shooting enemies

2563
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
on the road and after

2564
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
you complete the rally you get an extra

2565
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
fuel reserve depending on how many

2566
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
enemies you destroyed

2567
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
so you get fuel by blowing shit up

2568
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
each consecutive kill shot increases

2569
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
your multiplier one up to ten

2570
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and this lowers your multiplier by one

2571
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
so whatever your multiplier

2572
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
is that when you cross the line

2573
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
you get

2574
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
that much fuel

2575
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
so

2576
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
excuse me, I just finished my coffee

2577
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
wow girl, shut up

2578
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
it's your coffee

2579
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
like I said you have

2580
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
a checkpoint, a midway point

2581
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
where

2582
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
when you cross that line you actually get

2583
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
the amount of fuel in the main tank restored

2584
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
to what it was at the beginning of the rally

2585
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
but your reserve

2586
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
tank is not restored so it's just basically

2587
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
like you get a quick

2588
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
fill up, quick fill up

2589
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
so you've got different cars in there, you have the stingers

2590
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
which are orange, command cars

2591
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
which are purple, they have bulletproof bumpers

2592
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and must be killed by a cruise missile

2593
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
or an electro shield, you have cycles

2594
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
rat jeeps, they come in from the left

2595
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
stop it and swerve to the right, so basically

2596
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
they're like knights in chess

2597
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
gun turrets, you have mines

2598
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
on the road, you cannot destroy

2599
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
them but you get alarms that let you

2600
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
know where they are, and toxic

2601
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
spills, you get special weapons

2602
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
you get the UZ cannon

2603
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
it's a rapid fire gun that does not

2604
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
deplete your multiplier

2605
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
but they have limited ammo, you have a cruise

2606
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
missile which kaboom you get three missiles

2607
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
a nitro inject

2608
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
which increases your speed from 210

2609
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
to 298

2610
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
kilometers per hour

2611
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
electro shield

2612
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
which lets you drive through the enemy

2613
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
unharmed for a short distance and you get three

2614
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
to a pack

2615
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
they wanted

2616
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
though, now this is a little bit of

2617
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
information about the production which actually this little bit

2618
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I did not know

2619
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
the creators wanted to have an electronic

2620
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
version of Mr. Sandman

2621
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
to play on one of the levels

2622
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
but they never put it in

2623
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
that's kind of weird

2624
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
no, this is weird

2625
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
it had a promo with the original arcade game

2626
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
where you can send in your score when all 50 levels

2627
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
are completed to get a free road

2628
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
blasters t-shirt

2629
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
it had a toy tie-in by Matchbox

2630
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
so you get die-cast cars

2631
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
that can be customized with armor

2632
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
lasers, machine guns, rocket launchers

2633
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
and jet engines, there were the

2634
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
turbo force and the motor boards

2635
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
during the gameplay you would get

2636
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
a slightly robotic sounding female voice

2637
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
that gives you advice

2638
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
and it has different phrases

2639
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
including hit it and eat

2640
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
lead road hog

2641
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
and when you use your nitro inject

2642
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
you get, now that's cruising

2643
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
a guy with a last name that I can't pronounce

2644
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I'm guessing it's a Polish name

2645
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Stan Szczepanski

2646
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
holds the

2647
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
official Guinness World Record

2648
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
for roadblaster

2649
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
at 2,216,120 points

2650
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
if you beat this

2651
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
we'll give you some air

2652
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
and that's it, roadblasters

2653
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
alright

2654
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
good classic game of the week, I remember

2655
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
many bowling alley trips to play

2656
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
roadblasters, among other things

2657
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
alright, let me shut up

2658
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
ok, be quiet roadblasters, we're done with you

2659
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
for now, alright

2660
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
we're gonna take a quick break guys

2661
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
we're not done, we're just gonna take a little break

2662
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
to rest ourselves, bathroom break

2663
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
and what have you, more coffee for dark soccer

2664
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
no, break or whatever she might need

2665
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
garris break

2666
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
we will be back though in about 6 minutes

2667
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000

01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
we'll be back in like 6 seconds

here live at the VOG

2677
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
network, the voice of geeks network

2678
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
we'll be back after

2679
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000

welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge

2681
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Radio, the show where every gamer has

2682
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
a voice, we are live here on

2683
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
July the 29th of 2012

2684
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
with the 467th episode of our show

2685
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
already in progress

2686
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
big night tonight

2687
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I was laughing so hard

2688
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
in part A that it hurts, if you have no idea

2689
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
what I'm talking about

2690
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I guess you'll have to tune in to the podcast later

2691
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
which Marissa will not be plugging on her Facebook

2692
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
just for the record

2693
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
but Marissa is in studio joining us tonight

2694
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
and hopefully above all else

2695
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
having a good time, I hope so

2696
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
not just

2697
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Marissa having a good time with our show

2698
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
but the folks participating in

2699
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
PlayStation Home Summerfest

2700
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
the fan event going on

2701
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
right now, we are in the Aurora

2702
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
1.5 space, but to make sure

2703
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
you're in the right instance

2704
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
you do want to make sure you follow somebody

2705
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
there, I think Home Event Bot

2706
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
is no longer in there if I was looking

2707
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
correctly earlier, but you could

2708
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
follow Black Wolf, he is in

2709
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
there right now, and so

2710
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
am I

2711
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Green Sky with IE

2712
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
at the end, you can follow either one of us

2713
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
into the appropriate event space

2714
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
there, it looks like Tiger Claw is in there as well

2715
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
so hopefully you can follow a friend

2716
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
into PlayStation Home

2717
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
it has thinned out a little bit

2718
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
it is getting later and later on the east coast

2719
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
some people have some other things to do tonight

2720
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
but to all of you that are still there dancing

2721
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
and chatting along there

2722
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
a big thank you to staying up

2723
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
late with us here at the Voice of

2724
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Geeks Network and listening to Orange Lounge Radio

2725
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Black Wolf is in

2726
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
VoG chat and he's

2727
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
in the PlayStation Home space right

2728
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
now saying, they are bubbling me in Home

2729
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
now, I don't want to know what that means

2730
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
what about bubbling somebody

2731
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
isn't it? I don't know

2732
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
is it what the floor was doing?

2733
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
no, the floor makes those pretty effects

2734
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
alright, I'm being told to pick a number

2735
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
between 1 and 100

2736
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
and say it on the air for another

2737
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Blender giveaway, he was awesome enough

2738
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
to give something away during

2739
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
R

2740
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
the letter R will not work

2741
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
he was awesome enough to give something away during the Bobby Black Wolf show

2742
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and he's giving something away now, who knows what it could be

2743
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
but I will let the lovely Marissa

2744
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
she's here tonight, pick that number between

2745
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
1 and 100, Marissa what's it going to be?

2746
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
3

2747
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
3, she's low balling it

2748
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
alright, 1 and 100

2749
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
please don't make any references to balls with me after the first one

2750
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
3

2751
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
balls Marissa?

2752
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Marissa, 3 balls?

2753
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
really?

2754
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
alright, 3 it is, that's the magic number

2755
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
good luck, hope it's you

2756
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
I don't know what that's

2757
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
going to pick, but Blender will let us know

2758
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
alright, meanwhile

2759
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
we're going to get back

2760
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
into some rapid fire news

2761
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
and some quick news stories

2762
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
and then the FUGL question of the week

2763
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
and I'll explain that for those that are new to the show

2764
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I do want to once again welcome any new

2765
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
listeners who you might have this week because of Summerfest

2766
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
or whatever, if you don't know Orange Lounge

2767
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Radio, we've been around for 10 years, believe it or not

2768
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
we started the show back in

2769
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
2002, in June

2770
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
of 2002, it was back

2771
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
then, a show we created

2772
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
in support of the

2773
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
music gaming community

2774
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
especially games like Dance Dance Revolution

2775
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Beatmania, Bust a Move

2776
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
or Bust a Groove, depending on what country you're from

2777
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
that whole series

2778
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
everything music game related

2779
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
especially DDR was the big arcade game

2780
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Dark Soccer, Loki and myself

2781
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
all met playing DDR, if you can believe it

2782
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
at a place called Golfland

2783
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
or, you know, sometimes we'd

2784
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
go to the bowling alley, or we'd drive all the way

2785
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
to Stockton, Loki, remember

2786
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
we'd drive all the way to Stockton Golfland

2787
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
to play DDR Fifth Mix when they had that

2788
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
but as the years went on

2789
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
we decided, you know what, yes we love DDR

2790
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
but we love all video games as well

2791
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and our show became about all video games, especially

2792
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
the community, because the style of our show

2793
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
has always been

2794
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
you know, we would do these arcade

2795
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
nights where we play DDR, and then we'd go

2796
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
to a restaurant called Brookfields

2797
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
a local place here afterwards, and

2798
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
just have dinner and talk shit about things we

2799
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
liked and didn't like, and that's kind of

2800
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
the atmosphere we bring to the show

2801
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
is we literally sit around a big table

2802
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
and talk some shit, but you guys get to

2803
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
talk with us in the chat room

2804
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
via Skype, via the mailbag

2805
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
and all of that good stuff

2806
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
and we really do care about what you guys have to say

2807
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
and that's why we call it a show where every gamer

2808
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
has a voice. Anyhow

2809
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
alright, after that little reintroduction

2810
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
just for the folks new to our show tonight

2811
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
let's go to some rapid fire news

2812
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and talk some shit, Loki

2813
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I'm good at that, you know, talking

2814
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
shit and stuff, so let's talk about

2815
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
one of my games that I'm very

2816
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
happy about, Grand Theft Auto 3

2817
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
coming back to the

2818
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Playstation on the Playstation Network

2819
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
has a downloadable title

2820
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and it will be coming this Tuesday

2821
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and that is the first

2822
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
of the kind of

2823
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Playstation 2

2824
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Grand Theft Auto games, so pretty awesome

2825
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
it's gonna be 10 bucks, so check that out

2826
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
if you can

2827
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
or if you're like me, just buy the old copy

2828
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
because I have an original Playstation 3

2829
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
rub it in, rub it in, rub it in

2830
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
so I can play my original copy of

2831
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

2832
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
with hot coffee

2833
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
can't wait, you know what I'm waiting for

2834
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
speaking of Grand Theft Auto, aside from 5

2835
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
where the fuck is Retro City Rampage?

2836
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
I want that game now

2837
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
supposed to be this summer

2838
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
question mark

2839
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and then completely

2840
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
off topic

2841
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
I watched some video in 1080p

2842
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
from our Activision rep for

2843
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Black Ops 2, I need that

2844
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
game now

2845
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
that is a sexy game

2846
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
we went and saw, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week

2847
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
because it's not really a game, but we finally went and saw Batman

2848
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
on Tuesday, and they played a

2849
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
trailer for that, they played

2850
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
a video game trailer before the movie, which I thought was

2851
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
interesting, it wasn't like a

2852
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
you know how movie theaters do this now

2853
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
I'm sure every movie theater in America does this now

2854
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
like you go to the movie and

2855
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
before the trailer starts, there's just the

2856
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
20 minutes of basically commercials

2857
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
that they call like, what is it, First Look

2858
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
or the 20 or something where it's just

2859
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
it's just commercials

2860
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
get here early and see our

2861
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
ads, yeah you consumer whore

2862
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and they were

2863
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
showing a trailer for that Modern Warfare 2

2864
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
and Alan

2865
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
leans over to me and goes, this looks bad

2866
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
this doesn't look good, and I'm like

2867
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
it's a shoot em game, honey, you wouldn't like it

2868
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
it's a great game, he doesn't know what he's

2869
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
talking about

2870
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
no seriously, the new one's actually being

2871
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
kind of ties in with Batman because it's being written

2872
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
by the guy that did

2873
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
yes, I was in the ads

2874
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
it looks good, there's some new

2875
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
stuff that they're adding

2876
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
it'll be the first Modern Warfare game

2877
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
that I'm actually going to get at launch

2878
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm finally caught up

2879
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
except it's not really Modern Warfare

2880
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
I mean it's Future Warfare

2881
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
anyways, so let's talk a little bit about

2882
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
arcade games, and I actually have

2883
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Double Fish on my arcade cabinet

2884
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I haven't really played a whole ton of it

2885
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
but I have it emulated

2886
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
and it was a game

2887
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
that was on Sammy's

2888
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Autonomous Wave

2889
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Autonomous Wave arcade

2890
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
hardware, they had a lot of other stuff like

2891
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Dolphin Blue and stuff

2892
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
and it was a fighting game, it was pretty awesome

2893
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
well, Dimps

2894
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
the company behind it

2895
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I guess, picked up the rights to it and now

2896
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
they're going to be re-releasing it on

2897
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
consoles

2898
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
not consoles, I'm sorry, arcades

2899
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and they're bringing Rumble Fish 2

2900
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
to arcades

2901
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
which was

2902
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
in 2005, and now it's coming back

2903
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
and I guess

2904
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
it's on this new

2905
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Nesica Live

2906
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
or Nesica Cross Live

2907
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
it's a

2908
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
not a streaming platform, but it's a

2909
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
platform where arcade

2910
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
owners

2911
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
can actually download

2912
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
games to cabinets

2913
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
digital download of arcade games

2914
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I'm surprised

2915
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
that's only just now becoming a thing

2916
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
because that makes an awful lot of sense

2917
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I forgot a shoutout I wanted to do at Start A Part B

2918
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm so sorry, this is so important

2919
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I'm so pissed I didn't get to go this year

2920
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I mean, I just, juggling priorities

2921
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
California Extreme

2922
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
was this weekend, and I got

2923
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
sent pictures and video

2924
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
and apparently they had a full on

2925
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, I don't know if it was Chuck E. Cheese

2926
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
but one of the likes, animatronic band

2927
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
that would sit there and creepily play songs

2928
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
cause I got sent a video of one

2929
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
that's awesome, so I mean

2930
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
you never really think of that cause there's a lot of Chuck E. Cheese's

2931
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
that have closed down

2932
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
or just upgraded and stuff

2933
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I hope I didn't get that wrong

2934
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
but it's that style

2935
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I would love to have the old

2936
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Bullwinkles stuff

2937
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
maybe that's what this is, I don't know, anyway

2938
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I'm gonna hand that to Marissa, hit play

2939
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
so that Loki can see it too

2940
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
that way you guys can kind of check that out

2941
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
that's why it was sent from California Extreme

2942
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
and they're singing

2943
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Total Eclipse of the Heart

2944
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
that is pretty amazing

2945
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I was sent

2946
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Neil sent that there

2947
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I would just put that out in my front yard

2948
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
all year round

2949
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
he had a animatronic band

2950
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
it's Halloween, put a fucking

2951
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
pumpkin in front of them

2952
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
it's Christmas, put

2953
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Santa hats on them

2954
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
so shout out to California Extreme

2955
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I'm so sorry I couldn't make it this year

2956
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
the shadow casting was this weekend too

2957
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
it would only make that thing better

2958
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
if they would fucking just

2959
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
totally get some

2960
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
brick rolling going on there

2961
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
never gonna give you up

2962
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
oh boy

2963
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
anyway, so we're at

2964
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Rebel Fish

2965
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I think it's pretty cool that they have arcade hardware

2966
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
you can download games for

2967
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
if it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy some

2968
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
arcade hardware I could download games to

2969
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
well, I have arcade hardware I guess I could download games to

2970
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
not entirely legally

2971
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
but you know

2972
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
still, that's a cool idea

2973
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I guess

2974
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
alright

2975
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
and then of course, this is kind of cool

2976
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I know a game that we kind of liked

2977
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
a while back

2978
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Puzzle Quest, they put out a couple games

2979
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
and kind of disappeared

2980
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
but now Puzzle Quest is coming back

2981
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
apparently this is kind of

2982
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
because

2983
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Firemint, the company that

2984
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
put out the game

2985
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I guess they

2986
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
or they just

2987
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Firemint is now

2988
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
putting out the game because they purchased

2989
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Infinite Interactive, which was the original creator of the game

2990
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
and so now it's

2991
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
coming back

2992
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Puzzle Quest 2 is pretty awesome, it was on like every system out there

2993
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
and I'm not talking about the galactic one

2994
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
that didn't do so well

2995
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
but Puzzle Quest 2 is really good

2996
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Puzzle Quest is a pretty cool game

2997
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I wasn't a fan of the galactic one but

2998
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I would be, I'd be down for more

2999
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
of the old Puzzle Quest

3000
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
heck yeah

3001
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
alright I got a few stories for you guys as well

3002
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
or Puzzle Pirates, I'd be down for that too on consoles

3003
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Puzzle Pirates, Puzzle Pirates

3004
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
you can do Puzzle Pirates on Steam

3005
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
for what it's worth, it's free to play MMO right now

3006
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
you didn't know that?

3007
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
yeah, it's on Steam

3008
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
yeah, but no one's playing it anymore

3009
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
they will play it if you will play it Logie

3010
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
we will be Puzzle Pirates together

3011
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
alright, I got a couple stories for you guys here

3012
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
first one is about

3013
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Super, or excuse me, New Super Mario

3014
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Brothers 2, did you know I had a

3015
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
working title called New Super Mario

3016
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Brothers Gold, in fact that was

3017
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
supposed to be the name, and you know they've kind of

3018
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
been saying this a lot, this is, even at E3

3019
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
when they were talking about it, what does Mario

3020
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
love more than anything? Gold coins

3021
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
and this new game's all about coins

3022
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
well, apparently

3023
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
it was about

3024
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
excuse me, it was

3025
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
it was so much a part of the game

3026
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
that it was originally going to be

3027
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
called New Super Mario

3028
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Brothers Gold, but

3029
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
yeah, they went back and called it New Super Mario Brothers 2

3030
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
but they were worried too many people would think it's just

3031
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
you know, a cheapy, or a cheap

3032
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
cash-in on the first one

3033
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
of the first one, yeah, but hey, switching

3034
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
out gold and putting two in there, that totally

3035
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
you know, gets rid of the whole

3036
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
thought that it's a cheap cash-in on the first one

3037
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
it's now about, it's all about the coins

3038
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
now, Loki

3039
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
oh yeah, it's all about that, it's totally

3040
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
different than the last game

3041
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
alright, a

3042
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
comment from Crytek is our next story

3043
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
about the Wii U

3044
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
you know, we've been getting more and more developers commenting

3045
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
on this, producer Mike Reed

3046
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
mentioned that

3047
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Crytek is talking about working with

3048
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Nintendo, a version of Crysis 3

3049
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
for Wii U should not

3050
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
be ruled out, he would not

3051
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
confirm if it's in development

3052
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
or not, but it's sounding pretty

3053
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
likely, and here's a quote

3054
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
from ComputerVideoGames.com

3055
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I wouldn't say there's no chance

3056
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I wouldn't say no chance, I mean the Wii U

3057
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
still doesn't have any kind of release date

3058
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
attached to it at this point, who knows what the

3059
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
future will bring with it, I can definitely say

3060
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
that we are working with Nintendo, and that's about all

3061
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I can say on that front, I wouldn't rule it

3062
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
out, but there really has been no official releases

3063
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
associated with the Wii U yet, and

3064
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
given that we're releasing Crysis in an 8 month

3065
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
time period in February of 2013

3066
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
we can't play off of what their

3067
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
schedules are, I wouldn't rule it out, but you know

3068
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
it's a possibility.

3069
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I mean come on, their

3070
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
hardware is pretty much

3071
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
on par with the current consoles, it's

3072
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
not that hard to port that over, I mean

3073
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
they're porting other games over, so

3074
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
yes, of course there's gonna be that

3075
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I think what the stipulation is

3076
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
gonna be, you know, what's Nintendo require

3077
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
from these people putting out stuff

3078
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
for their platform, are they making them

3079
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
hey, you gotta have some unique gameplay that

3080
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
involves their tablet, and

3081
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
them figuring out, well, how are we going

3082
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
to

3083
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
fit this

3084
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
tablet gameplay into

3085
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Crysis 3?

3086
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
One more story about

3087
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
the Nintendo Wii, with no

3088
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
U attached to it,

3089
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
apparently some retailers are out of stock

3090
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
right now on the Wii, GameStop,

3091
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Target apparently reported some of them

3092
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
have the console back ordered,

3093
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
some Best Buys and so forth are just now

3094
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
getting stock in again. Here's the thing

3095
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
though, most people are drawing from

3096
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
this that either Nintendo's about to do a new

3097
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
holiday bundle, so they're trying to get rid of what's on

3098
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
shelves now, or this is

3099
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
in preparation for the Wii U, they

3100
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
might be trying to clean out the old stuff a little bit

3101
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
to make room for the Wii U.

3102
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Loki, any insider thoughts

3103
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
from your perspective?

3104
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
I haven't seen a lot of demand for the systems,

3105
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I would think if they're trying to clear out

3106
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
the stock that they wouldn't be on back order,

3107
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
they would be in

3108
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
plentiful supply because they're trying to

3109
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
get rid of them. I don't think that they

3110
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
have a problem with, I don't think Nintendo's sitting

3111
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
on consoles right now,

3112
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
it could just be that they're

3113
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
just switching production from

3114
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
you know,

3115
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
who knows how long, I'm assuming

3116
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
that they've got to start producing these consoles,

3117
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
so maybe they're starting to switch

3118
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
over some of those manufacturers that are doing

3119
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
the Wii to making the Wii U

3120
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
system instead, just to get prepared.

3121
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Before we get to Dark

3122
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Sakura's stories, let me talk

3123
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
some comments from our chat room at

3124
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
live.vognetwork.com

3125
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Tigerclaw says, you know with all those gold coins

3126
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Mario has collected, you think he would use those

3127
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
coins to build a high end security to protect

3128
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Princess Peach?

3129
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Gameguru says, why isn't Wario the villain here?

3130
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
He loves coins.

3131
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
And we have an update from Bobby Blackwolf at

3132
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
PlayStation Home Summerfest, going on right

3133
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
now in Aurora 1.5 space,

3134
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
saying that the random

3135
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
number contest ended up being

3136
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
that you had to use the random number

3137
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
action, and whoever hit 3,

3138
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Marissa's number first, won a

3139
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
gift from the Lockwood gift machine, and

3140
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
the winner was GTIVW1975.

3141
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So congrats!

3142
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
A clap for you.

3143
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Golf clap.

3144
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Golf clap. Golf clap.

3145
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Alright.

3146
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Let's move on, Dark Sakura.

3147
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Well we have a few goodies.

3148
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
What we have is Little Big Planet 2

3149
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
getting Disney Princess

3150
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
edition, where they all look

3151
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
kind of bizarre.

3152
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But I think everything in Little Big Planet

3153
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
looks bizarre. So there's two different

3154
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
DLC packs. One of them, like I said,

3155
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
is the Disney Princesses.

3156
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
The costume pack one has

3157
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Aurora, Cinderella, Jasmine, and Snow White.

3158
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And then the second one is Belle,

3159
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Tiana, Rapunzel, and

3160
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Ariel. Yay.

3161
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Then,

3162
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
we have some information

3163
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
about Dance Central 3.

3164
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
We have

3165
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
the songs

3166
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
that are going to be out on it.

3167
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
As some of these people

3168
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I really do not know who they are.

3169
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I'm assuming some of them I do.

3170
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
To anyone, whoever the fuck that is,

3171
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I am the best. We have Alice DJ,

3172
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Better Off Alone, fucking love that song.

3173
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Backstreet Boys,

3174
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
JJ Fad,

3175
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Lil Jon,

3176
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Eastside Boys featuring Nyan Nyan Twins,

3177
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
whatever.

3178
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
LMFAO, Lost Del Rio,

3179
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
we have

3180
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Maroon 5 with moves like Jagger.

3181
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I actually really like that song.

3182
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
We have Ice Ice Baby.

3183
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
We have Vicky Sue Robinson,

3184
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Turn the Beat Around, and Village People

3185
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
YMCA.

3186
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Whatever happened to Alice DJ?

3187
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
That was like my college

3188
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
years right there. Alice DJ is Better Off Alone.

3189
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Apparently.

3190
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And then, last but

3191
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
never least, the Nintendo 3DS

3192
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
XL UK

3193
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
price.

3194
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
This is going to be $179.99.

3195
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Again, that's in

3196
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
pounds.

3197
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Tesco's, however, will be offering

3198
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
the device for

3199
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
£175.

3200
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
So, you want it cheap, get it at

3201
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Tesco's.

3202
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Game, one more,

3203
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
has a trade-in deal that for $79.99

3204
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
you can trade in an old boxed

3205
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
3DS and

3206
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
get the 3DS XL.

3207
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So that's it.

3208
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.

3209
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Alright.

3210
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Moving on, we have a segment

3211
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
we always do here on Orange Lawns Radio

3212
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
called the Fugal Question of the Week.

3213
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You might be asking yourself,

3214
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
what the hell is a Fugal?

3215
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Put Facebook

3216
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
and Google Plus together

3217
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
and you get Fugal. That is what it is.

3218
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
We ask a question each week in our Facebook

3219
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
and Google Plus communities

3220
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
and you guys answer it. Here's this week's question.

3221
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
There's a couple betas

3222
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
going on right now, including Guild Wars 2,

3223
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Little Big Planet Karting, and

3224
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Sony PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,

3225
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
just to name a few. Have you

3226
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
ever made a decision whether or not

3227
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
to buy a game based off the beta?

3228
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Considering that betas are

3229
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
unfinished products, do you think that

3230
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
it was a fair decision

3231
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
or should a company not put it out there

3232
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
if it's not ready to be judged?

3233
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I thought it was a good question

3234
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
not just because I thought of it.

3235
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
So let's get to some of these comments

3236
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
here. I want to

3237
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
start with Google

3238
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Plus tonight.

3239
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
And yes, there are people posting on Google Plus.

3240
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
My quick impression of Google Plus.

3241
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Hello! Hello!

3242
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
No, we have

3243
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
two comments from Google Plus

3244
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
tonight. There's

3245
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
at least two people using Google Plus.

3246
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Some weeks we get four.

3247
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
All right, Reddertainment says

3248
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
no, but I did buy

3249
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
cakes prolonging the magic after

3250
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
listening to Alpha Beta Parking Lot,

3251
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
which I...is he plugging something?

3252
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I don't know what the...

3253
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
had nothing to do with the question, sir.

3254
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
However, Flaco Jones responded

3255
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
saying, I knew after playing all the

3256
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
starting areas in the Final Fantasy 14 beta

3257
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
that it wasn't worth buying.

3258
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I do think that was a fair decision

3259
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
since the game came out a month later

3260
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
and was reportedly as bad as the beta

3261
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
was. Yeah, that was

3262
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
a beta that ended up being pretty accurate

3263
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
I gotta say. Good reminder

3264
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Flaco Jones.

3265
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Going to Facebook for some of the comments from Facebook.

3266
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Amanda, Amanda R says

3267
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I've played in betas that were out only

3268
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
a couple weeks before game release

3269
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and by this time, these are mostly

3270
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
finished products with only minor tweaks

3271
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
being made. I have made the decision

3272
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
to not buy a game when it came out because

3273
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
the beta was just not fun and with

3274
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
that close to the release, not

3275
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
enough changes were going to be made to change the game

3276
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
in any significant way.

3277
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Cody T says, I've played betas of

3278
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
a million games and I think I've bought

3279
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
most. I think betas are more for the

3280
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
developer than for the consumer. It's a cheap

3281
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
way to see exactly what is wrong with the game

3282
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
by the best judge, us.

3283
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
And it's a way for the gamer to be involved in the actual

3284
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
development of the game.

3285
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Nick M. responds

3286
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
saying, I believe a public or

3287
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
large closed beta is the only responsible

3288
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
decision for game companies if their game

3289
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
relies heavily on multiplayer

3290
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
due to the large number of, excuse me

3291
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
large amount of problems that will often

3292
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
otherwise show their head on launch day.

3293
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
However, more often than not, betas

3294
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
talk me out of buying games that I'm already

3295
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
on the fence about.

3296
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Boschka responded

3297
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
and said, yes, the only game

3298
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I have ever done it for is a game that's

3299
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
actually free when it comes out.

3300
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Path of Exile. Think Diablo 2 and new features

3301
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
and updated graphics. I donated

3302
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
$10 not only to get a second beta

3303
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
key for a friend, but because I love

3304
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
what they're doing with that game. If I could get more

3305
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I would. Blizzard just take some

3306
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
notes on how to make a good action RPG.

3307
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Ooh, sick burn.

3308
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I think it's fair. People

3309
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
have to learn what a beta is for. It's not

3310
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
a demo. You're testing buggy code.

3311
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
You're testing builds that are normally

3312
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
four to five builds behind what the devs

3313
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
have. Some games basically require

3314
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
betas based on the sheer size. For example,

3315
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
in the Mists of Pandaria beta

3316
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
they changed one ability for a

3317
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
boss fight and the next thing you know there's an

3318
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
elevator coming out of the ground on another continent.

3319
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
If the company says before

3320
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
that it's not a demo, it's a beta, I think

3321
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
that is completely fair. If you don't get the

3322
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
difference, you're not the type of tester they want anyway.

3323
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
A long but good comment from

3324
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Boschka.

3325
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Let's see.

3326
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Wicked says, I believe betas are an

3327
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
integral part of games development.

3328
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
It gives the fan base an inside look at

3329
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
what is to come and also gives

3330
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
the developers instant public feedback to

3331
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
work out any bugs the game may have.

3332
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
However, game companies should be wary

3333
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
about using open betas as it sometimes

3334
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
gives the gaming community expectations

3335
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
they may not have had before, positive

3336
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
or negative.

3337
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Sometimes the game does not live up to the

3338
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
over-hype that sometimes follows certain

3339
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
open betas or some good games

3340
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
could easily be overlooked due to

3341
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
negative reactions to betas. So

3342
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
while betas can easily help a game's

3343
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
development, it could easily skew the game's

3344
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
anticipation in the public eye.

3345
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And lastly, Chiggers

3346
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
responds saying, I've bought games based on

3347
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
the demos. Does that count?

3348
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Kind of. Demos

3349
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
are a little different than betas. I think

3350
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
kind of going back to the other points, like betas

3351
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
are put out there

3352
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
because they're not supposed to be demos. They're

3353
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
supposed to be tests for the developers. But

3354
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
kind of where I was trying to go with the question

3355
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
is that a lot of people look at betas as

3356
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
demos in this day and age. Is that fair?

3357
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Or should the developers be real

3358
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
and realize that's how most people

3359
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
are going to view it? Anyhow,

3360
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
thanks for all those answers on Facebook at

3361
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

3362
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
I didn't read them all

3363
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
so please go check out the post to read

3364
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
some of the other great insights from

3365
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
this week. Really appreciate it guys. Sorry

3366
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I couldn't read them all, but it's only

3367
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
a three hour show.

3368
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Alright.

3369
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Oh, by the way, XLink

3370
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
giving me the update in our chat

3371
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
room at live dot vog network dot com.

3372
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Here's what happened to Alice DJ.

3373
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Quote,

3374
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
after the group went their

3375
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
separate ways, Prank decided

3376
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
to move on to other ventures by putting her

3377
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
music career aside to become a makeup

3378
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
artist and beauty fashion consultant.

3379
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I remember

3380
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
the video. She was a

3381
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
very hip looking gal. I remember

3382
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
that. They actually had like two

3383
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
videos for that song, Better Off Alone.

3384
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Anyhow, well, I learned something

3385
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
tonight about Alice DJ. Who knew?

3386
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I've learned about pornography

3387
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
and I've learned about Alice DJ. Who

3388
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
knew? Marissa's

3389
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
hiding her head. This is adorable.

3390
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Loki,

3391
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
what do you got for us next in

3392
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
other gaming news?

3393
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Alright, so let's talk a little

3394
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
bit about

3395
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
you know, rock band. And this is kind of funny

3396
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
because I don't know

3397
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
if you guys remember, a couple months back we had a

3398
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
scare where, hey, guess what?

3399
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
You know rock band that you purchased

3400
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
on IOS and stuff like that?

3401
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
It's being delisted. It's being taken away.

3402
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
And you know that game you just

3403
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
purchased? Well, now it's going to be completely useless

3404
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
because you're not going to

3405
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
be able to get anything anymore for it.

3406
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
It's just, it's going to be gone.

3407
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Well, and you may remember

3408
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
that they came out and said, oh, no, no, no.

3409
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
That's not happening. That message was

3410
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
sent in error. Well, the error was that

3411
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
it was sent two months early.

3412
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Because now, yes, they are actually

3413
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
delisting the game.

3414
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Well, I don't think people were mad

3415
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
that the game was being delisted. I mean,

3416
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
whatever. People are pissed if it wouldn't

3417
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
work anymore. That was the

3418
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
original, like, scare campaign going around is that

3419
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
haha, you just bought this game and none of

3420
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
your DLC or anything is going to work anymore.

3421
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
LOL, bye. You know,

3422
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
but that doesn't appear to be the case. I mean,

3423
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
if they're just pulling it from the store, then whatever.

3424
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Well, they're pulling basically the

3425
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
rock band, um, IOS game

3426
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and rock band reloaded IOS game

3427
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
and all the, um, I think

3428
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
all the DLC for it as well.

3429
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Yes, you will not be able

3430
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
to purchase any more DLC for it.

3431
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
So,

3432
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
and that's supposed to happen effective

3433
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
July 31st.

3434
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
So, a couple days from now.

3435
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Well, yeah.

3436
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
As a musician, like,

3437
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
yeah, um,

3438
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
which, I'm sorry,

3439
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm actually just being unemployed.

3440
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
But,

3441
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
with regard to the, um,

3442
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
the music games, it's actually, especially

3443
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
guitar players, like, games like Guitar Hero,

3444
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
especially at the time, it was at its height,

3445
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
really enraged.

3446
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
You know, musicians, they got so angry,

3447
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
especially since a lot of people were misinformed

3448
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
and they, you know, you,

3449
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I even heard a lot of people

3450
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
ignorantly at GameStop believing that it could teach

3451
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
you how to play guitar. However,

3452
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
um, I ended up, um,

3453
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
my friend's mother ended up winning a free copy

3454
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
of Rocksmith, so we played it.

3455
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And, um, that was actually one where you, uh,

3456
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
they gave you, you know, an XLR cable, and you actually,

3457
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
you could actually plug in your guitar to the Xbox.

3458
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
And that actually was a pretty good game, and then

3459
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
actually, I mean, you plug in your own guitar to it, and that actually,

3460
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
um, I had

3461
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
guitar players play it, and they actually found it challenging

3462
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
and interesting, and it actually, you know,

3463
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
accurately, you know, presented theory and things like that.

3464
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
You know, I'm glad you said that.

3465
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
And you don't, you didn't

3466
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
know this before you said that, but I usually have to

3467
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
refrain from comment on that game, because

3468
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
a really good friend of mine knows somebody

3469
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
that's a big part of the development of that

3470
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
game, so I usually don't try

3471
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
to avoid the topic on the show because of

3472
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
conflict, but, uh, I'm glad you said that.

3473
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I'm sure that'll make somebody very happy to know that.

3474
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Yeah, I didn't get that far into

3475
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
the game, but I mean, I enjoyed it, and I think

3476
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
that, um, you know,

3477
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
it's not gonna turn you into a virtuoso,

3478
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
but I mean, um, you know,

3479
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
if you're too cheap to go, to go get lessons

3480
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
immediately, it's a good place to start, just to get, like,

3481
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
a very basic foundation, and it's fun.

3482
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Yeah, I understand that game does

3483
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
have kind of quite a bit of, like, a cultish

3484
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
audience, I don't know what it sounds like, but, like,

3485
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
a lot of the makeup of, I

3486
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
think, who's into that game is kind of like people

3487
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
who are rediscovering

3488
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
getting into music maybe at a later age.

3489
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Like, it's not like kids and teenagers

3490
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
and so forth playing it that rock band

3491
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
tends to skew towards, like college parties and stuff,

3492
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
but, like, Rocksmith is, like, 30-somethings

3493
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
who always wanted to learn to play

3494
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
an instrument that never did.

3495
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I wish that they had, um, I guess it didn't be

3496
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
That's my impression, it's not, like, just my impression of it.

3497
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I, um, I guess it didn't, you know,

3498
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
my understanding is, you know, it didn't

3499
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
blow up, necessarily, but, I mean, I wish

3500
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
that they had a, um,

3501
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
a wider, um, library

3502
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
of music, you know, it started to when it came

3503
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
out, they started releasing stuff all the time, but I wish it had

3504
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
more, you know, but, you know, that's just selfishly

3505
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
excited, you know, it'd be fun to play.

3506
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Well, they do DLC pretty regularly.

3507
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
And you're in luck, because they have Rocksmith

3508
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
and Bass, or Guitar and

3509
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Bass coming out, uh, this October.

3510
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
You don't need a game

3511
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
You don't need a game to teach you bass, no.

3512
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I'm kidding.

3513
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I'm kidding, actually.

3514
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
It does require

3515
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
talent. Just not a lot.

3516
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
You don't have to be a

3517
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
retarded monkey.

3518
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
No, actually, though, I have friends like

3519
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Freebo. I have friends who are excellent bass players.

3520
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
And all the running musicians joke, making fun of

3521
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
bass players. Good times,

3522
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
good times.

3523
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
It's just, are you a fan of Green Day?

3524
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Like, I like Green Day,

3525
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
but let's be real, a lot of their songs are kind of like

3526
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
the same chord over and over, and it cracked

3527
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
me up, because he was sitting there, he's

3528
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
gonna be the guy that's lead singer in the band

3529
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
is gonna be one of the, not like a judge,

3530
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
but like a mentor or something on The Voice.

3531
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
But he's working with Christina

3532
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Aguilera. And I don't know why,

3533
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
but I found that to be like the funniest thing I'd heard

3534
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
all week. Okay. You're not gonna

3535
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
appreciate this, but any other

3536
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
musicians listening to this

3537
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
and the

3538
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
band that now

3539
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
knows my embarrassing past that I've told

3540
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
to tune into will appreciate this.

3541
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Green Day is

3542
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
kind of like the Creedence Clearwater

3543
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
of their time.

3544
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I know that sounds obtuse,

3545
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
but there's always this joke that like

3546
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Creedence Clearwater songs and John Fogerty's songs

3547
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
only require three chords to play.

3548
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And that is essentially, I mean, there is

3549
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
something to be said about, you know, Green Day's later

3550
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
artistic merit, you know, and there are things

3551
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
to be appreciated about it, but

3552
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
do I think that they should be

3553
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
held in that high of a regard?

3554
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
No. Well, I'm not a member

3555
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
of the cult though, you know.

3556
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I appreciate some of the things that they've done,

3557
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
but I'm not a cult member or anything.

3558
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
You know, and it's amazing where they've come, you know,

3559
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
singing songs about acne and masturbation

3560
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
to

3561
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
guitars that were out of tune.

3562
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
To like commentary on President Bush and so

3563
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
forth, and that Broadway play.

3564
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
They've come so, oh god.

3565
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Rissa, you alright over there?

3566
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I feel like, you know, like

3567
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Green Day songs with, you know,

3568
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Fosse moves.

3569
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Uh,

3570
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Stan in our chat rooms, you are

3571
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
spurring some music discussion in our chat rooms.

3572
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Stan says, same with Hansen.

3573
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Bop is only three chords.

3574
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
They didn't even have three hits.

3575
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
They had like 30

3576
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
babies between them all though.

3577
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
The girl in Hansen's

3578
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
pretty cute.

3579
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
No, they're actually all from evangelicals.

3580
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
That means Justin Bieber

3581
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
is like the Hansen of our

3582
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
time, basically.

3583
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Justin Bieber has his own video game now too.

3584
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Oh god, I hope not.

3585
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
People don't understand. Teenage girls

3586
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
are stupid. I said this is

3587
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
a former teenage girl.

3588
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
As one who was once

3589
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
a teenage girl. I was there, I was there.

3590
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
I have authority on this subject.

3591
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I do. I mean, granted,

3592
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I never had bop posters on my wall

3593
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
or anything. No, no, no, no, no, dear.

3594
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
This is what you get for being younger than me.

3595
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I had new kids on the block.

3596
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Everyone can shut up.

3597
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I was, the kids

3598
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
in my school called Victoria.

3599
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
So,

3600
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
so I was very much the

3601
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
anti that, but the thing that people don't get

3602
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
about this, and of course, yes, it's interesting

3603
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
how the media will exploit everything when it comes

3604
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
to a tween star like this, including

3605
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
the areas of video games and apps

3606
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
and all this crap, but it's just

3607
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
just, they just

3608
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
found a boy to fill

3609
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
the slot of cute teenage boys

3610
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
singing songs to seduce, it could

3611
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
have been anyone, you know. They just,

3612
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
you just put him in the spot and they put the marketing

3613
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
movement behind him and done.

3614
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It could have been anybody. It had nothing to do with

3615
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
who Justin Bieber is. Nothing.

3616
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Sorry. It fascinates me at what musicians

3617
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
get movies, too.

3618
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Like, Justin Bieber

3619
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
gets his movie at like the Megaplex and so forth

3620
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
and then fucking Katy Perry

3621
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
has this big,

3622
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
uh oh, uh oh.

3623
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I just opened Pandora's box.

3624
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
If Katy Perry

3625
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
gets her own movie,

3626
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I should have, you know,

3627
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
my own, you know, like quadruple

3628
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
sequel and then mini

3629
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
series and TV shows.

3630
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Let's face it, she got the movie

3631
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
because of her titties, okay?

3632
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I mean, she has some cute

3633
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
songs, blah, blah, blah, but mainly it's because

3634
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
she's beautiful, you know, and people

3635
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
like talking about her boobies, apparently.

3636
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
So, that's why she- And Elmo.

3637
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
So, I deserve my own series.

3638
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
You should be a Star Trek next to that.

3639
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
You should be like four TV

3640
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
series, what is it, like

3641
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
nine movies and fanfic.

3642
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
If her movies alone get her

3643
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
a movie, I deserve so much more.

3644
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
But then, here's

3645
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
what fascinates me, like, yeah,

3646
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Katy Perry has some catchy songs, whatever.

3647
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
When you're drunk at a gay bar, you

3648
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
don't care. Oh, Katy Perry, I love her!

3649
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
You know? She's a big marketing team

3650
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
too. But, I mean, she's kind of a tool.

3651
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
But then, you have, like,

3652
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
LCD sound system had, like,

3653
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
their big, you know, farewell thing and all that

3654
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
and like, what did they get? They got

3655
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
like, they got a Fathom event.

3656
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
They got like, their movies

3657
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
like one night only at the local

3658
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
cinema.

3659
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Life is not fair. Before the Metropolitan

3660
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Opera, you know, movie theater

3661
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
night, you know?

3662
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Poor guys. Alright.

3663
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Anyhow.

3664
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
ActDeft in our chatroom says, Marissa

3665
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
the movie 2, electit boobaloo.

3666
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
That should be the name of your next album.

3667
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Alright, moving

3668
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
on.

3669
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
That's how Katy Perry sells shit, I can do it too.

3670
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
You just,

3671
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
you gotta get out of the little affair

3672
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and get into the pop music.

3673
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
All I need is some vocorder and some autotune.

3674
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Just whine about a boy who broke up with you

3675
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
years ago or something, you know?

3676
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Just sing about Dave Coulier.

3677
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
You know?

3678
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Insult the women that actually are gay

3679
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
and can't help it and pretend to be a lesbian

3680
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
and, you know, to amuse men.

3681
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
It's great. Get in a

3682
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
pillow fight, braid somebody's hair.

3683
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Oh my god!

3684
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Free someone's bra. We used to do

3685
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
that dip of bra and orange juice and put it in the freezer

3686
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
for the first girl who fell asleep.

3687
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Yes.

3688
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
That's hot. Keep talking. Alright.

3689
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Moving on.

3690
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Okay, this is bad.

3691
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Because we're going to go from such humorous, happy

3692
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
discussions to really unfortunate

3693
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
situations.

3694
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I'm about to Debbie

3695
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Downer the show a little bit.

3696
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And talk about some layoffs.

3697
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Stop laughing, Marissa.

3698
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
Stop laughing, Marissa. Inappropriate.

3699
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
No, this news really does

3700
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
suck. Maybe we should skip

3701
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
this story.

3702
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Read it already.

3703
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
We need variety.

3704
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Uh oh, Marissa's choking.

3705
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Alright.

3706
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Serious face.

3707
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Microsoft laid off a

3708
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
small, as they put it, number of positions

3709
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
at their Vancouver based development

3710
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
studio. This is because Project

3711
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Columbia, whatever this was, we

3712
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
don't know what the real name was, it got

3713
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
cancelled. It's off the

3714
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
books now. It was supposed to be an educational

3715
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Connect title. It was going to educate

3716
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
young people. It was going to pair books with

3717
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
music and illustrations. I guess

3718
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
it had something to do with the Sesame

3719
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Workshop as well. That doesn't necessarily

3720
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
mean it was a Sesame Street game. But it

3721
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
sounds like it was something that was kind of geared towards kids.

3722
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Or the like.

3723
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Wonder Book Connect.

3724
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
And then they saw the Wonder Book presentation like, wow.

3725
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
That looks like shit.

3726
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And then they're like, woo. Scrap that.

3727
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Perhaps. But layoffs are

3728
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
never good news. Especially

3729
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
also when they hit Warner Brothers. Seattle

3730
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
also had some layoffs hit them this

3731
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
week. They were currently working on

3732
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Lord of the Rings Guardians of Middle Earth.

3733
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
And if you might be thinking to yourself, God, they're

3734
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
still making Lord of the Rings games? Well,

3735
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
there's a Hobbit movie coming out at the end of the year. You might have

3736
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
heard of it. It's a big deal. So yeah.

3737
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Moolah moolah. Unfortunately,

3738
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
not enough moolah, apparently.

3739
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Layoffs hit the studio once back in

3740
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
November that was supposed to be 60 people.

3741
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
And a statement from WB

3742
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
says, quote, due to shifting business

3743
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
imperatives, Warner Brothers Game

3744
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Seattle has made staff reductions. The

3745
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
group will continue to remain an integral part of

3746
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment.

3747
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Yikes. Now,

3748
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
since I would like to end with a little bit of a positive,

3749
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
id Software,

3750
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
id Software, you know,

3751
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
they made like Doom and shit.

3752
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
They are actually hiring

3753
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
right now. They are

3754
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
hiring on their website for a

3755
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
UI programmer job for, quote,

3756
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
an unannounced game on future

3757
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
generation consoles.

3758
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
So could it be something that

3759
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
is a sequel to one of the past

3760
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
franchises? Possibly, because the listing

3761
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
actually says, quote, familiarity with

3762
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
id Software games, characters, brands,

3763
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
and universes. So who knows?

3764
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
It could be a new Quake. It could be a sequel

3765
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
to Rage. It could be a game with

3766
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Space Marines versus either

3767
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
demons or

3768
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
aliens. It could be Commander Keen

3769
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
6 or 7 or

3770
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
whatever they're on now for all we know. So

3771
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
there you go. Anyhow,

3772
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
that's it for

3773
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
that story. Let's move on. Dark

3774
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Soccer. Okay, well, in other

3775
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
news, how about

3776
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
something about that PlayStation

3777
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
All-Stars crap that's coming out?

3778
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Oh, you think it's crap?

3779
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I don't know.

3780
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
We're gonna, actually, we're gonna have Beta, somebody

3781
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
we know very well has been in the Beta.

3782
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
We're gonna have Beta impressions in a little bit.

3783
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Well, I'm not necessarily going to call it

3784
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
crap. I'm gonna call it potential crap.

3785
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
So, um,

3786
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
there are some, uh,

3787
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
people who have gone through the data

3788
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
files for PlayStation All-Stars Battle

3789
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Royale and has nine

3790
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
stages, eight characters, and a bunch of other

3791
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
stuff. So what we have

3792
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
is a Bioshock Infinite stage,

3793
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
um, Sir Daniel

3794
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
is it Fortesca Fortescue

3795
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
from Medieval?

3796
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Dante from Devil May Cry, Spike

3797
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
from Ape Escape, Raiden from Metal Gear Solid,

3798
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
um, Nariko

3799
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
from, uh, Heavenly Sword,

3800
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
and, um,

3801
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
we've got David Hayter saying he's

3802
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
recording dialogue.

3803
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
So, and he's, um, sorry,

3804
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
he's Snake, so.

3805
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I believe all the characters that you

3806
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
mentioned, but they're new characters that haven't been

3807
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
released yet. Well, yeah. Well, I'm gonna go through the whole list.

3808
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
This is the, the new stuff, okay?

3809
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000

And then, supporting

3828
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
characters, as in minions, Captain

from Metal Gear Rising.

3836
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
And then it says, there's, like, just a bunch

3837
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
of modes, but as far as stage goes,

3838
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Alden's Tower, Black Rock Stadium,

3839
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Columbia,

3840
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
uh, Franzia from Locoroco,

3841
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
that actually looks pretty neat. Um,

3842
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Is it Franzia boxed wine as well?

3843
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
No, that's Franzia. This is

3844
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Franzia. Well, my bad.

3845
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Marissa's, Marissa and I

3846
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
think alike. Paris, tip it!

3847
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Tip it, Kathleen, tip it!

3848
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
We think, like, old 50-year-old. I'm sorry, I think of

3849
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Kathleen Griffin.

3850
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
I do too. I have San Francisco from

3851
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Resistance, um, Stillaways from Uncharted,

3852
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Time Station from Ape Escape.

3853
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
So, yeah, I'm most excited about Locoroco

3854
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
stage, really.

3855
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And all these were from, hacked from files

3856
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
from the beta. Yes.

3857
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Hackers gonna hack! Exactly!

3858
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
People should know that by now.

3859
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Hack like what? I'm looking forward

3860
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
to playing as Parappa. I think the

3861
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
game looks fun. Yeah.

3862
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I, I heard, I'll let the,

3863
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
the person who's gonna review the beta in a minute here,

3864
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
which we just talked about, you shouldn't

3865
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
do that, but hey! And that is, I believe,

3866
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
against the, uh, end-user license

3867
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
agreement, or the, uh, was it the, um,

3868
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
confidentiality agreement?

3869
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
This... We ain't the

3870
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
ones gonna get sued out for it!

3871
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Ain't our asses! It's not me! It's not me

3872
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
playing it! I got a special tipster.

3873
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
We'll, we'll break out the,

3874
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
the voice, uh,

3875
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
disguiser, and the shadow,

3876
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
everything for, so they aren't

3877
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
identified. Well, tech,

3878
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
this person's using someone else's beta.

3879
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
So, it's even, like,

3880
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I know, right? A woo-woo!

3881
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Anyhow.

3882
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Um,

3883
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
moving on. Loki.

3884
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I wish I was in a

3885
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
beta test for that game.

3886
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Looks awesome. I try,

3887
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I was like, give me, give me the logon

3888
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
and password so I can get into.

3889
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Um,

3890
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
so there was a hack that was, um,

3891
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
demonstrated by a Russian hacker,

3892
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
uh,

3893
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
using, uh,

3894
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
basically a way to spoof the

3895
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
iOS, or the Apple Store,

3896
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
um, servers

3897
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
to allow him to make

3898
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
free in-app purchases.

3899
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Pretty much, um, they say,

3900
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
uh, you know, he

3901
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
enabled, I guess, 8.4 million

3902
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
fake in-app purchases.

3903
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Over 115 games were affected,

3904
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
including, um, you know,

3905
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
all the big stuff, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja,

3906
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Infinity Blade, Plants vs. Zombies,

3907
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
uh, that kind of stuff. And,

3908
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
um, apparently, Apple, though,

3909
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
is, of course, gonna fix this. They say

3910
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
the fix will check whether in-app

3911
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
downloads were valid, and

3912
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
fake purchases will be wiped from the

3913
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
device. In other words,

3914
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
it's gonna slow everything down.

3915
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
So, thank you

3916
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
for ruining it for everybody. Appreciate that.

3917
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Of course, you know, um, it's gonna require

3918
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
that, you know, these people that publish

3919
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
these apps are gonna need to update, um,

3920
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
their apps with a new API for it.

3921
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Um,

3922
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I don't know how they're gonna, how's that

3923
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
really gonna work? Like, say, for example, I

3924
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
use that glitch or whatever,

3925
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
or that exploit to purchase

3926
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
a bunch of tower bucks or something in

3927
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Tiny Tower, and then I spend

3928
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
all of them. How are you gonna take

3929
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
that away? I mean,

3930
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I don't see how it's gonna work. I don't

3931
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
think you can at that point. I don't think

3932
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
for consumables like that, I don't think you can

3933
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
actually do anything. I see, like,

3934
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
okay, if I purchase, you know,

3935
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
songs from Rock Band or something like that,

3936
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
make sure that I actually purchase those

3937
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
and then go from there,

3938
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
but...

3939
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Maybe the game could break?

3940
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Like, if it takes you into negative tower bucks

3941
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
or whatever, it just says, fuck you,

3942
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I'm out. Then the game stops

3943
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
working or something. I don't know.

3944
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
From what I'm aware, though, the hacker, I don't think

3945
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
has released, um, the method

3946
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
of how that's done, although

3947
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
it's just being done, like, um,

3948
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
somehow, I guess, he just spoofed

3949
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
the, um, response from those

3950
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
servers. Very interesting.

3951
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Hmm.

3952
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Alright, well, moving on to a different topic, this

3953
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
has to do with Sonic and All-Stars

3954
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Racing Transformed. This is that Sonic

3955
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
game that has all the really interesting characters,

3956
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
like Danica Patrick is, like, a playable

3957
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
character, and then we talked to Wreck-It Ralph,

3958
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
uh, last week. Well, um,

3959
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
apparently, there is, uh, an interesting comment

3960
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
that was made this week. Uh, this was

3961
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
by the digital, or, excuse me,

3962
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
the executive producer, Steve

3963
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Lysette, who's with Sumo Digital.

3964
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Uh, he's basically implying that the

3965
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
characters could be different

3966
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
depending on which platform you purchased the game

3967
02:15:50,000 --> 02:16:18,000
on.

3968
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Why is this? Well, some platforms

3969
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
have characters that are unique to that platform.

3970
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I'm not gonna say which, that's part

3971
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
of the fun of the reveals. Some are

3972
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Sega characters, some are not.

3973
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Don't bother asking.

3974
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
This has a lot of people speculating

3975
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
that maybe the Wreck-It Ralph

3976
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
will end up being a Nintendo exclusive

3977
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
guy because of all

3978
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
those, you know, stories about how

3979
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
the Nintendo characters are the ones in the movie,

3980
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
and apparently, the Wreck-It Ralph

3981
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
official game is only gonna be on the Nintendo

3982
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
consoles. It's kind of leading people down

3983
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
those lines. We won't really know until

3984
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
the rosters are revealed for all three platforms,

3985
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
but, interesting speculation.

3986
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
And I believe the reason why,

3987
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
uh, well, the reason why it's

3988
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
exclusive on the Nintendo platforms is also

3989
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
they're kicking in some money for marketing as

3990
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
well, um, for the Activision

3991
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
game, so, it makes sense.

3992
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
It does, it does.

3993
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Alright, well, let's

3994
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
take a look at our

3995
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
mailbag.

3996
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Music

3997
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the

3998
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
mailbag head first and reads a few emails

3999
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
for you. Mailbag at

4000
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4001
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Now, Dark Sakura, when you weren't here last week,

4002
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
there was, like, eight emails sent to the show.

4003
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
So, we only read half of them,

4004
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
and we saved the other half for you. Well, there's

4005
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
three that I saw.

4006
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
These might be the leftovers from last week, I know.

4007
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Well, this is July 22nd, so.

4008
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Um, greetings, OLR.

4009
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle. I just wanted to

4010
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
share how much I love Steam sales, and boo

4011
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
to Origin. As someone

4012
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
who doesn't need many games on

4013
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
release days, I always wait for the

4014
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Steam sales. I can't wait for this holiday.

4015
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
If you want, please share the damage

4016
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
that Steam did, um, to each of you.

4017
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Your loyal turtle and Philly series turtle.

4018
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
And I think I just bought, uh,

4019
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Borderlands, that's all. We ended up, uh, actually

4020
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
talking about the Steam sale last week a little bit,

4021
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
so I'll, uh, kind of point you back

4022
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
to that show, but Dark Sakura, that was the only

4023
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
damage they did to you, was Borderlands?

4024
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Yeah, pretty much. Oh, we'll have to play together sometime.

4025
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I have to actually install it.

4026
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Marissa, you ever use Steam? I know you're not,

4027
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
you're not a huge, huge gamer girl, but you,

4028
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
you like the adventure games. I gotta say, Steam is

4029
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
a good place to look for some of the newer stuff,

4030
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
if you're into adventure games. I don't know.

4031
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I have not, but I probably should, because I have had

4032
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
the same recommendation as well. Yeah, because some

4033
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
of that stuff goes on sale, like, dirt cheap

4034
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
sometimes, and it's like, if you, they actually

4035
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
have a Lucas Arts pack. I

4036
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
don't, something's missing from it, it was just

4037
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
probably, oh yeah, Maniac Mansion, because that was the Game of the Week

4038
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
last, or the Maniac Mansion sequel

4039
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
was the Game of the Week last week, and,

4040
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
um, because we let Alan pick when you were out, and he

4041
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
picked the Day of the Tentacle, and that was one of the

4042
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Lucas Arts games that's missing from that pack.

4043
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
But you can get, I think it has, like,

4044
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Loom and some of the other things that Dark Sakura's picked

4045
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
in the past. That's one of the big things on there,

4046
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
so, yeah, pretty cool.

4047
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Alright.

4048
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Oh, yes, next email.

4049
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Um, the theme,

4050
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
the subject is Garris.

4051
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
And it starts off, Garris.

4052
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Hello sentient creatures. There is a media

4053
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
event that I'm sure you are aware of. This is something

4054
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
that people have been eagerly anticipating,

4055
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
and have been looking forward to

4056
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
for a while. I'm also sure that many of us

4057
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
out there saw this media event.

4058
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
However, there are some of us who haven't seen

4059
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
the media event, or have

4060
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
yet to see this media event in

4061
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
its entirety. It is for this reason

4062
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
that I email you today. Please, for the

4063
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
sake of all of us who haven't seen it, please don't spoil

4064
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
the British Open. Stay black,

4065
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
redertainment, Garris.

4066
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Or the Olympics. I think the joke

4067
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
might have been Batman, Dark Knight Rises.

4068
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I saw it.

4069
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
It wasn't bad.

4070
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
It had some really slow parts,

4071
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
though. It did have some slow parts,

4072
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
but I was okay with it in the scope of the

4073
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
big picture. I'm not gonna spoil.

4074
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I'm not gonna do that to you guys. I have one question

4075
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
from that movie. What? Why did Bane

4076
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
sound Belgian?

4077
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Is it just me, or did he sound Belgian?

4078
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I do not think you should talk about

4079
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
his voice in a negative manner.

4080
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
He sounded like Count von Count to me.

4081
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
He sounded Belgian.

4082
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
He sounded...

4083
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
With that same pleasant

4084
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Belgian... I liked his

4085
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
voice, even if it was a little silly.

4086
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
He sounded very pleasant. I'm glad

4087
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
they changed it from that trailer, though.

4088
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Like in the trailer, Bane sounded

4089
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
like this.

4090
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Okay, Tom Hardy.

4091
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Tom Hardy is...

4092
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I'm just saying this.

4093
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
As your resident gay gamer,

4094
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I'm just putting this out there. Tom Hardy

4095
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
is so fucking hot. Like, I can't

4096
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
even. I can't even.

4097
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
He's no Bruce

4098
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Campbell, I'm sorry.

4099
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
He wasn't that hot as Bane.

4100
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Oh, the movie. The movie, can I just say?

4101
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
It wasn't as good as the last

4102
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
one. I didn't say the last one. The Dark Knight

4103
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
will probably be the best comic book

4104
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
movie they ever freakin' make.

4105
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
But, I honestly

4106
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
think Dark Knight was better than Avengers. Don't get me wrong,

4107
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
I love the Avengers, but Dark Knight was off-manning.

4108
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
DC fails.

4109
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
This new movie was pretty good, except

4110
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
the tw...

4111
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I liked Catwoman. There was a twist.

4112
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
I was pleasantly surprised with Catwoman.

4113
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Anne Hathaway is a goddess.

4114
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Let's just be real. Anne Hathaway deserves

4115
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
to have statues built of her. The ending twist, I should have seen

4116
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
coming because I saw the casting.

4117
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
But, it still threw me.

4118
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Even though I knew!

4119
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Couple twists, and one of them I

4120
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
saw within like five seconds of the character

4121
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
showing up. I'm like, oh, not

4122
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
that. That's the one I probably

4123
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
should have seen coming because I knew better. Anyway, yeah.

4124
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Okay.

4125
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So, next email. I don't want to spoil anything.

4126
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Hi again, OLR. Well, Rob,

4127
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I wrote in last week requesting all your knowledge

4128
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
on Final Fantasy XI as we ventured

4129
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
into Van... Van...

4130
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Vanidel is how he wrote it. I guess it's

4131
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Vanidel. Oh, Vanidel. Whatever.

4132
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
To say stepping foot

4133
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
back into that world again was fresh

4134
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
and very nostalgic. I was greeted with many open

4135
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
arms and more than a few people to help me

4136
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
get my gears back in line to play.

4137
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Although, after playing for about

4138
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
six hours in between two days, I found myself

4139
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
wishing there were more wowish things

4140
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
about it. Oh well, I guess

4141
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
all other MMOs

4142
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
were the gateway drug to the ultra drug

4143
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
wow as we know it. As a sucker

4144
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
that is on the annual pass plan,

4145
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I guess I'll go roll a new

4146
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
toon and start my adventure all over again.

4147
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Just so I don't feel like I'm

4148
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
giving charity money to Blizzard.

4149
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Just

4150
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
really hoping something fresh comes

4151
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
from Guild Wars 2. Not being

4152
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
a hater or a troll, but it

4153
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
would be exciting to see a new MMO

4154
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
come out and be the prolific wow killer.

4155
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Your thoughts? And this is from

4156
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Travis. I'm gonna

4157
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
use this opportunity to give a cheap plug

4158
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
to the best little Horde house in Azeroth.

4159
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
www.hordehouse.com. It's the

4160
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
other show that I'm on on

4161
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
VOG Network that debuts Wednesdays

4162
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
here at VOG.

4163
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I will say this about World

4164
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
of Warcraft. And I've said

4165
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
this many times on Horde House. The

4166
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
game that will kill World of

4167
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Warcraft is

4168
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
World of Warcraft. That's right.

4169
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
That's gonna be the thing that kills World

4170
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
of Warcraft is itself. Because

4171
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
this is the type of thing that inevitably happens.

4172
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
What's killing Diablo 3?

4173
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Question mark.

4174
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Itself. So

4175
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I think the only thing that's gonna

4176
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
really kill World of Warcraft is itself.

4177
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Not that that's never gonna happen.

4178
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I mean the steam's gonna run out someday.

4179
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
And I guess maybe I

4180
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
should say instead of itself I should say Blizzard.

4181
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Because whatever Blizzard's next

4182
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
MMO ends up being will probably be

4183
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
I mean as long as they

4184
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
don't make some of the mistakes they made with Diablo 3

4185
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
which I think is inevitably gonna

4186
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
push back Titan or whatever this

4187
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
new MMO ends up being.

4188
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I think it could have

4189
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
a large impact on WoW's user

4190
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
base. But I think World of Warcraft's gonna be around

4191
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
for a long time to come.

4192
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Because so many people have invested so much into it.

4193
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
It's just the way it is.

4194
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Anyhow. That was it.

4195
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Oh that's it. Well then you should send more

4196
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
emails for next week. Mailbag

4197
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
at OrangeloungeRadio.com

4198
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
I wanna hear from some of you PlayStation home folks.

4199
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Give us some PlayStation

4200
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
related questions and so forth.

4201
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Or I

4202
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
here's a serious question

4203
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
for the home people. Do you think the PlayStation

4204
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
home gets a bad rap? Because there's a lot

4205
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
of people that don't

4206
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
take home very seriously or

4207
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
don't get home. And I'm gonna open in

4208
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Liam Mill. We've been kind of those types of skeptics

4209
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
on the show in the past. Because

4210
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
you know home was kind of

4211
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
plugged as this big

4212
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
centerpiece gateway

4213
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
that you know instead of like the cross

4214
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
bar on your PlayStation it would be home.

4215
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
You would walk into home and you would have that

4216
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
you know trophy case filled

4217
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
with all your trophies and so forth. And

4218
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
you know maybe the way we envision home

4219
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
in our mind hasn't actually been

4220
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
what's executed. Do you think

4221
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
your place has gotten

4222
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
a bad rap? I will say

4223
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
this. The community of course is wonderful

4224
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
and events and things like this. And I think home

4225
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
is a lot better

4226
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
now than it was three years ago. And there is

4227
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
a lot to unlock in there.

4228
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
And fun stuff. But you know

4229
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
kind of wanna throw that out

4230
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
there. I wanna hear from some of you at our mailbag.

4231
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4232
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Alright.

4233
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
And Black Wolf is reporting

4234
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
from live within PlayStation Home that

4235
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
the PlayStation Home folks agree

4236
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
that Avengers was better than Dark Knight.

4237
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Thank you.

4238
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I love you all. I love you all my children.

4239
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Cause I mean

4240
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
fucking Hawkeye. Sorry Hawkeye.

4241
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Or as

4242
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I've heard

4243
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
one smaller child say not

4244
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Becky's son but like a seven year old

4245
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Hawkeye.

4246
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Alright.

4247
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Moving on. It's time

4248
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
for us to get angsty in a segment

4249
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
we call the FUs of the Week.

4250
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Why do we have a segment called

4251
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
the FUs of the Week? Cause we can.

4252
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:18,000
FU.

4253
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
While driving to San Francisco

4254
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
yesterday I was

4255
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
on this little bit where the

4256
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
carpool lane splits off

4257
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
to sort of bypass the

4258
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
rest of traffic to get to the

4259
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
just past Emeryville

4260
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
to get to where you pay the tolls.

4261
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
And some

4262
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
sixty year old Asian man

4263
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
and now I normally

4264
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
do not support stereotypes

4265
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
but sometimes they exist for a reason.

4266
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
There

4267
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
has to be something that

4268
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
enabled the stereotype to

4269
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
exist. Why it's you know usually accepted.

4270
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Well definitely driving while Asian.

4271
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
In his little Mazda

4272
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
MPV

4273
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
decides that he's going to change

4274
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
lanes right where I am.

4275
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
And as

4276
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Marissa is my witness cause she was sitting

4277
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
there in the back. I beat

4278
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Luckily

4279
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
she had some airbags to protect

4280
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
her. I

4281
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
beeped my horn. I flicked

4282
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
my lights.

4283
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And definitely screamed

4284
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
what the fuck are you doing?

4285
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Several times in the car.

4286
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
And Becky was in the front seat. She was

4287
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
a mess after

4288
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
cause he ran right into where she was.

4289
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Luckily he wasn't going very quickly. We were

4290
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
going at speed. I was at going

4291
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
sixty five because

4292
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
of the way traffic was moving. And some other guy was on my ass

4293
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
so I couldn't slow down.

4294
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
There was no right to merge.

4295
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
And on top of that he was trying

4296
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
to cross and right where the line was starting to go solid.

4297
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Moving that fast

4298
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
having a collision that fast

4299
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
I mean no matter what

4300
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
it's lucky. I would have been

4301
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
like Becky. I would have been hysterics like

4302
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I would have been me. She was just tensed up.

4303
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Oh no I would have been full on tears.

4304
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Well here's what happened.

4305
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Me when I panic I either

4306
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
cry or scream.

4307
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
And I opted for screaming.

4308
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
You're very good at it.

4309
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
So here's what happened. He basically

4310
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
thankfully

4311
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I guess he

4312
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
got defensive enough or something

4313
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
and I honestly think that he started to pull over when I was

4314
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
in his blind spot. He knocked

4315
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
my passenger side

4316
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
rear view mirror off.

4317
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Which I'm very pissed off about because you know I love my car.

4318
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I love the Pontiota

4319
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
the rally vibe whatever we call it.

4320
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
And scraped up the side of my car

4321
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
I mean it's not bad damage. The car

4322
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
drove perfectly fine after that.

4323
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
But um

4324
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
so we stopped in the little divider like right where the

4325
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
lane split. So it was

4326
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
we had room to move around there.

4327
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And

4328
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
he comes out of his car yelling at me.

4329
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
So I'm like what the

4330
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
fuck dude you broke my car you

4331
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
still have a mirror.

4332
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
And just I was like

4333
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
and he was like yelling

4334
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
stuff I couldn't understand. Like please speak with

4335
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
some intelligence I can't understand you.

4336
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
And

4337
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
his wife was definitely a lot

4338
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
more reasonable than he was. And we got it worked

4339
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
out and it's funny

4340
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
we're both through AAA for our insurance.

4341
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
So I just had to say oh he's with AAA here's his

4342
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
number. Because I'm with AAA.

4343
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Oh he's got his record right now.

4344
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I've got photos because I

4345
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
am like that and take photos.

4346
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Well on my

4347
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
phone.

4348
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
And now here's

4349
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
what the stupid thing was in his little

4350
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Mazda MPV

4351
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
he had mattresses

4352
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
stacked right behind

4353
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
their heads to block his rear view mirror.

4354
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Including blocking

4355
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
his blind spot.

4356
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Which is not illegal

4357
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
but definitely not safe.

4358
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
And not good for his insurance.

4359
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
And I have photos of it.

4360
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Because I'm kind

4361
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
of an anal bitch that way.

4362
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
So um

4363
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
the other parts of

4364
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
my F.U. now go to the California

4365
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Highway Patrol. Now the guy didn't take a

4366
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
report because nobody was injured.

4367
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
The cars were relatively

4368
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
fine.

4369
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Well

4370
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
they can

4371
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
but at this point

4372
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I was just like fuck it dude I'm hungry

4373
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
and I'm

4374
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
and I'm you know I was

4375
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
you know how I get when I get on that

4376
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
verge of anxiety

4377
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
where I'm just kind of shaky

4378
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
and don't want to deal with shit. That was me.

4379
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
So um

4380
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
I stopped and

4381
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
did some deep breathing and but this is

4382
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
funny because we kept seeing people pulled over

4383
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
the whole fucking way from Sacramento

4384
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
to San Francisco and back.

4385
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
The highway patrol is everywhere

4386
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
we wait like 20 minutes

4387
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
for them to show up.

4388
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Giving out chicken shit tickets

4389
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
is serious business. Very important.

4390
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Well it's like

4391
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
and I

4392
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I have to say that my defensive

4393
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
driving is pretty good.

4394
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Except the thing is that I couldn't

4395
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
swerve to the side because there was a wall

4396
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
next to me and it would have been

4397
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
worse to run into the wall

4398
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
than have the dude run into me and I

4399
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
I tried to speed up to get around him

4400
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
which is I honestly think that

4401
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
me speeding up was why the

4402
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
collision wasn't worse because

4403
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
and it's like his mirror was just like

4404
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
tipped up just a little bit just tipped

4405
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
up a little bit. Mine was gone.

4406
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Mine is somewhere in Emeryville right now.

4407
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
So fuck him.

4408
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Um now

4409
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
this is the other part of the fuck you.

4410
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Fuck everybody on the road who was beeping

4411
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
at us and going nice job.

4412
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Didn't help when I

4413
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
got out of the car either.

4414
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Keep it classy California.

4415
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Well one of the guys managed to

4416
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
stop like slow down

4417
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
just enough for me to go

4418
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
you get out here and fix it then.

4419
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And he rolled

4420
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
up his window.

4421
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Bastard.

4422
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I love it when your anger isn't directed at me.

4423
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Alright. Well it's

4424
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
just

4425
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
I don't you know I don't get

4426
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
and you know the lady at Allstate

4427
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
she was like oh it's always the people who

4428
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
were at fault that do the yelling. You mean AAA?

4429
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
AAA. Yeah I called Allstate first because

4430
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
I was so well when I got home I was

4431
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
every time I looked over to look

4432
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
in my rearview mirror and didn't see it

4433
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
not there I just get pissed again.

4434
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
So when I get home I'm so pissed off and shaky

4435
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
and you can ask Marissa. I was pissed

4436
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
off and shaky. I

4437
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
went to Allstate instead of AAA.

4438
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Oops. Nice. So

4439
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm on the phone with freaking

4440
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Allstate and they're trying to find information for me

4441
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
like wait I'm with AAA. Hang up.

4442
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Well Misty in our chat room

4443
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
at live.vognetwork.com says if I find it

4444
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
when I pass through Emeryville next time I'll get it back

4445
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
for you.

4446
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
I've got I will

4447
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
share a picture from my Facebook with everyone.

4448
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Alright Loki I don't know how you're gonna follow that

4449
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
but good luck. FU?

4450
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
FU to

4451
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
people that change up tournament rules

4452
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
15 minutes before the tournament starts.

4453
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Come on. That's a little ridiculous.

4454
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Thankfully I'm patient. If my wife had it

4455
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
her way I'd be

4456
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
trying to get my money back.

4457
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I'd be trying to get money for the gas. I'd be

4458
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
trying to deface their

4459
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
website and smear them

4460
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
all over all the other sites. I just

4461
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
I don't I don't want to put

4462
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
that much effort. Thank God Nelly wasn't in

4463
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Jamie's car. You should break off his rearview mirror.

4464
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
To kind of go a little bit

4465
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
with what Jamie said. FU

4466
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
to people that change lanes without signaling.

4467
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
And there's a lot of them.

4468
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
This guy didn't signal either.

4469
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
It's like dude you're like

4470
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
and they were elderly people

4471
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
but it's not just elderly people.

4472
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
All shapes and sizes.

4473
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
In my case it's elderly Asians.

4474
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
But seriously I mean and the people that

4475
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
are older

4476
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
not necessarily elderly but like at least

4477
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
in their 50s. Dude how long have you been

4478
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
fucking driving? Really is the

4479
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
turn signal like a new thing to you just now?

4480
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
You haven't figured out how to fucking use it?

4481
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
That's just sheer laziness is what

4482
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
it is. And the fact that you don't signal

4483
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
means probably not looking either so

4484
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
you know fuck those people because

4485
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
they're the ones that are dangerous out there like

4486
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
not paying attention to anything

4487
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
or drifting into other lanes.

4488
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
I hate that too. Or when you make a

4489
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
fucking left turn and the guy just like

4490
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
I'm gonna take a really wide turn

4491
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
so I have to go into like the median just to get

4492
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
away from the guy. So fuck people

4493
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
that just don't pay attention

4494
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
on the road.

4495
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Well I'll go next.

4496
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I don't know I don't really have any traffic I've used

4497
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
this week. Sorry to break form here but

4498
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
I will say this. F you to the

4499
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
fact that I kind of hurt my knee pretty bad

4500
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
last week because in my role

4501
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
that I was playing in Repo the genetic opera

4502
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
I got to die three times

4503
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
as three different cops. So

4504
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
one of the times I died

4505
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
I hit the ground pretty hard and I

4506
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
kind of fucked up my knee doing that.

4507
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Maybe I should actually wear the knee pads next time

4508
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
but I didn't have time when I changed my

4509
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
costume to get them on because they can

4510
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
kind of be a pain in the ass. So F you to the fact

4511
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
that I fucked up my knee. Oops

4512
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
not that music. This music. Oh yeah one other thing

4513
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
F you to the hills in San Francisco

4514
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
and having to walk uphill both ways.

4515
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Just saying. Through the snow. Walking from

4516
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Japan town to the Castro

4517
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
L and back. Marissa

02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
you know. You can't fucking

4531
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
complain about anything traffic you

4532
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
people are crazy in L.A. You're just

4533
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
constantly in the upright position on the

4534
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
road out there.

4535
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Nice. Oh yeah well I

4536
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
would say F you to the gentleman I mentioned

4537
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
earlier.

4538
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
But I don't want to

4539
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
never mind because that involves F you.

4540
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000

Well played.

4544
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Reminds me of a time when like one of the

4545
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
first times we went out there for

4546
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I think it was

4547
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
yeah it was for one of the our first E3

4548
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
out there I'll never forget we were driving

4549
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I think to the Final Fantasy

4550
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
concert or something like that.

4551
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
Something that was on the freeway and I remember

4552
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
we saw someone passing on

4553
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
the right of us we were in the right lane by the way

4554
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
passing on the right they were actually

4555
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
off roading to pass us

4556
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
on the right in the right most lane

4557
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
of the freeway.

4558
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
That's that's that's

4559
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
that's ballsy.

4560
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
All right two more stories for you guys then we're gonna

4561
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
get to the Skype line at one eight seven

4562
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
seven game O.L.R. but not just yet

4563
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
because we have a few more stories

4564
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
starting with Loki. Yes so one of

4565
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
the games that's being kick started right now is

4566
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
actually another Shadowrun game Shadowrun Online

4567
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
and they talked a little bit more

4568
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
details about their game and showed a little

4569
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
bit of game play which looks pretty awesome it kind of

4570
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
it's like a high res

4571
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
HD version of like the top down

4572
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Shadowrun game on you know Super

4573
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Nintendo except you know the way you shine

4574
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
your graphics and stuff. The game

4575
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
though is gonna be kind of set up like

4576
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Guild Wars where you pay once and

4577
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
basically you're

4578
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
playing the game. There's no month to month fees

4579
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
however of course there's gonna be like micro

4580
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
transactions later on down the line if you want to

4581
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
buy special things and

4582
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
stuff. And also they're showing

4583
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
some of the different things in there

4584
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
they have a portion of the game where

4585
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
okay you go these hub worlds and you get

4586
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
your mission and there's a part of

4587
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
the mission that requires

4588
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
you to do the investigation work and

4589
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
leg work and so if your leg work

4590
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
isn't very good you may not know that hey

4591
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
there's an easier way to get into this

4592
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
you know location

4593
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
in order to get this information or hey

4594
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
this is gonna be heavily guarded by something

4595
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
so you'll kind of you know

4596
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
know a little bit about it

4597
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
but

4598
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
that's kind of cool. And then of course they're saying

4599
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
that the game at launch is gonna

4600
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
retail for $39.99 of course

4601
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
if you back the Kickstarter you'll

4602
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
get the game at $25

4603
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
at that donation level

4604
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
and

4605
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I guess a new campaign

4606
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
they're gonna be launching every three to

4607
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
four months for $15

4608
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
so it could be kind of add on

4609
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
expansions.

4610
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Sound like something you might be putting money down for?

4611
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Maybe, I mean

4612
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I've already backed one

4613
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Kickstarter Shadowrun game

4614
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
so I'd be kind of curious

4615
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
but once again I don't have time for MMOs

4616
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
but the game sounds like

4617
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
it's more

4618
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
single player with other

4619
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
people at the same

4620
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
time kind of I don't know

4621
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
you can play it single player

4622
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
you can play it you know co-op

4623
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
or you can do PVP

4624
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
so it'll be neat

4625
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I mean I'll have to see when it comes out

4626
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
I'm probably not gonna back it though. Alright

4627
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
just because I've backed too much stuff recently

4628
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
so. Alright one more story

4629
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000

Okay I'm getting a message

4666
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
via Black Wolf from

4667
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
PlayStation Home. Blender wants

4668
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
to do another contest. Pick an animal

4669
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
and the first person to type that animal

4670
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
into the home space

4671
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
wins another prize in home. So

4672
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
an animal. What animal

4673
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
are we going to pick? Should we go obvious?

4674
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Dark

4675
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Sakura why don't you pick for us?

4676
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
What animal do you think they should type

4677
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
in the home chat?

4678
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I can't tell them that though. They have to

4679
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
guess right?

4680
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Pick an animal. Wait

4681
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
wait are we

4682
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
You're going to have to clarify.

4683
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Do we say it?

4684
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Do we say it or are they supposed to

4685
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
guess? Okay yeah

4686
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Black Wolf says yes. Say it.

4687
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Lemur. A lemur.

02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Alright there you go.

02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Come on baby sloths are adorable.

4700
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
So whatever.

4701
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
And no Garris is not an animal.

4702
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Garris is

4703
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
turian.

4704
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Alright and remember

4705
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
He just said that.

4706
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
I'm risking an animal

4707
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
in the sack.

4708
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
This is all I hear

4709
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
from people that play Mass Effect so

4710
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Remember. No it's

4711
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Kayden for me.

4712
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
If you talk to the gays they'll all say

4713
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Kayden.

4714
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Kayden's an ass

4715
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
who actually his

4716
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
model is like the guy he's modeled

4717
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
after and who did all the face cap and stuff

4718
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
is like a gay partender from the abbey.

4719
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
And he's hot.

4720
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Oh my god.

4721
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
I gotta admit he was easy on the eyes.

4722
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Alright Skull King

4723
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
won of course he did.

4724
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Of course he won.

4725
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
But you know what he deserves it for

4726
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
for helping support the

4727
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
vog

4728
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
participation with Summerfest.

4729
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Lemurs lemurs cutie furry lemurs.

4730
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Alright let's move on

4731
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
to the Skyplane.

4732
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
I gotta open that up 1877 Game OLR

4733
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
The Skyplane is open right now

4734
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
for you guys to give us

4735
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
a call and if you wanna call us

4736
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
from Playstation Home awesome.

4737
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
If you're one of our regular listeners who wants to call us

4738
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
that's awesome too. We will talk to you

4739
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
at 1877 Game OLR.

4740
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Meanwhile let me get

4741
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
to some Twitter topics. We have a few things

4742
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
that were sent to us via Twitter

4743
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
and I wanna look at this from Tigerclaw

4744
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
cause this tweet here from Tigerclaw just

4745
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
jumps out at me it's like wah wah what?

4746
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Irrational Games

4747
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Job lists 85

4748
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
plus Metacritic score as

4749
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
a requirement.

4750
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
This is the developer of Bioshock

4751
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
and Bioshock Infinite. It's Irrational

4752
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Games. They posted a job listing

4753
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
for a design manager

4754
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
and apparently one of their

4755
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
resume or whatever has to have a past

4756
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
work that has a high score

4757
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
on Metacritic. That's

4758
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
kinda surprising. It's posted on the Gamasutra

4759
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
job boards. Credit on at

4760
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
least one game with an 85 plus

4761
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
average Metacritic review score.

4762
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
How do you feel

4763
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
about Metacritic score having

4764
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
such weight especially when you consider the games

4765
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
like Child of Eden got an 84

4766
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Mirror's Edge got an 81

4767
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
hmm

4768
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Remember that whole controversy over

4769
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Fallout New Vegas and the bonus they didn't get

4770
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
because it was an 84?

4771
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
hmm

4772
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
So what's

4773
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
the job requirement is that they've had to publish

4774
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
or worked on the game that received

4775
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Metacritic over 85?

4776
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
You have to have some credit. Alright well

4777
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
let's go to the phones. What if like their co-worker

4778
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Bob just really bombed

4779
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
when it came to like you know

4780
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
it's like yeah we did all this really good work but man

4781
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
he just like he's made fart noises

4782
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
into a microphone for all the dialogue in

4783
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
the game and it just

4784
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
really hurt us.

4785
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Alright let's go to the phones. Hi

4786
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

4787
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Hey it's Oscar. Hey Oscar

4788
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Thanks for sitting there waiting while

4789
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
we got through that last conversation.

4790
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
What's on your mind buddy?

4791
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Oh that's fine.

4792
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I just wanted to say that this past Thursday

4793
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I made the 6 hour drive

4794
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
back and forth for 12

4795
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
hours total to Virginia

4796
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
like right outside of the DC area to see

4797
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
the Zelda Symphony.

4798
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Oh my gosh you drove 12

4799
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
hours to see the Zelda Symphony.

4800
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Well I went to... It was well

4801
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
worth it. I went to LA to see

4802
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
the Dear Friends concert so

4803
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
yeah it's about the same. It was worth it?

4804
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Yeah definitely. Tell us a little bit

4805
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
about the experience.

4806
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Like um I don't know did any of you guys buy

4807
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Skyward Sword and like see how they had the orchestra

4808
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
CD packaged in with the game? Sadly

4809
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
no I never got around to that one

4810
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
sadly. Alright well like

4811
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
it has like 7 or 8 or so tracks

4812
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
on that CD and

4813
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
it's

4814
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
they played pretty much most of those but there were so

4815
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
much more like they had complete like symphonic

4816
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
movements in each of the game. Like there was

4817
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Ocarina of Time movement, a Twilight Princess

4818
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
movement, a movement from

4819
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Link to the Past and oh my god

4820
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
the friggin Link to the Past one like I

4821
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
teared up at one part where they did the credits

4822
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
music cause I just forgot about that.

4823
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
That game is so good.

4824
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Yeah

4825
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
like don't get me wrong Ocarina of Time is my

4826
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
favorite but that game has some moments

4827
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
so that just I don't know.

4828
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
So you didn't just

4829
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
go by yourself I imagine you went with friends.

4830
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Yeah I had a couple friends with me

4831
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
that went like um

4832
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
actually it was one of my friends who posted on Facebook

4833
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I'm buying tickets today who wants to go

4834
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
and like I was one of the first people to respond

4835
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
and so he bought my ticket

4836
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
which was only $65

4837
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
for that theater it was like the Wolf Trap

4838
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Theater near DC.

4839
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
They were really good

4840
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
seats actually like they were pretty

4841
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
close. So you drove from

4842
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
where? You live in Ohio?

4843
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Michigan? Yeah well I live

4844
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
in Northeast Ohio but my friend

4845
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
who bought the tickets lives down in

4846
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Athens Ohio which is like the Southeastern portion

4847
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
of it so

4848
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
like I had to go down

4849
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
there anyway to like move stuff out of my apartment

4850
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
for the next year

4851
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
so it was no big deal

4852
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
driving down there myself but then

4853
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
he drove to DC for the most part.

4854
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Wow that's a long

4855
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
drive but that's awesome

4856
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
I mean sounds like it was quite the experience.

4857
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
What was the crowd like?

4858
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Um

4859
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
it was a mixed bag

4860
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
like I thought it was going to be a lot of kids but actually

4861
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
it was only a few

4862
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
and like a lot of teenagers to adults

4863
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
and like

4864
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
the kids that were there like I saw their

4865
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
dads that were with them all had their 3DS's

4866
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
out like it was just a street pass fest

4867
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
like just non-stop I

4868
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
probably got 100 during the course of the day.

4869
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Oh my yeah you probably could have beat

4870
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
find me in

4871
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
one sitting there that's awesome.

4872
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Oh definitely it was

4873
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
I don't know you need to go

4874
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
like you really should like um

4875
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I do if they come back through here.

4876
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
The last concert was in San Jose on December

4877
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
14th did you try to link that one?

4878
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Is it? I might just do

4879
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
that actually what day of the week is December

4880
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
14th let's see the 6th is umlaut

4881
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
and that says Thursday so

4882
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
that sounds like it would be a Wednesday no it's a Friday

4883
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
hmm maybe

4884
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
that would be great.

4885
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Go to zelda-symphony.com

4886
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
and there should be a link to the schedule up there

4887
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
and you can check it all out. Anyone want to go?

4888
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?

4889
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Alright we'll see I'll find

4890
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
maybe Alan will want to go we'll make it a

4891
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
trip I have friends in San Jose too

4892
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Mel and Mel live there and you know them from this show

4893
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
and it would be cool to go see something

4894
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
like that so yeah well thanks

4895
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
for the tip and I'm glad to hear you had a good

4896
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
time. Yeah

4897
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
I just hope that they release like

4898
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
another orchestrated CD like maybe after

4899
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
the tour is done because some of those songs I

4900
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
just really want to hear again. I'm sure

4901
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
they'll be another Zelda pre-order disc in the future.

4902
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Yeah there has

4903
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
to be. Alright well

4904
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Osfer I'm going to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call

4905
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
okay? Alright no problem.

4906
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Alrighty 1877

4907
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Game OLR our username on Skype is

4908
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to

4909
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
give us a call. Meanwhile

4910
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
some other tweets

4911
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
one more from Tigerclaw I let people have

4912
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
two tweets just a kind of a quick

4913
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
headline here Microsoft halts

4914
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
further development on what was to be the

4915
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
free-to-play game Flight

4916
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
it was supposed to be a free-to-play entry

4917
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
in Microsoft's Flight Simulator

4918
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
franchise I wonder if that has to

4919
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
do with the Vancouver layoffs we heard about earlier

4920
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
well

4921
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
I don't know it's

4922
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
it's I like the Flight Simulator

4923
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
games back in the day but I mean they're

4924
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
so intricate now like I don't actually

4925
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
know how to fly a plane people

4926
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
but it looked fun and pretty

4927
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
I remember those used to be like the graph that the

4928
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
high-end graphic games with the Flight Simulator

4929
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
games yes Marissa? Well I mean if you

4930
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
really wanted to make them properly accurate you need to have

4931
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
bitchy flight attendants

4932
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
that's a real flight simulator

4933
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
I want to join the Mile High Club

4934
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
you know bathroom

4935
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
alright we got another phone call hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

4936
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
who's this? It's Shane

4937
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
with a very bad voice right now because I'm

4938
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Flemmy

4939
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Hi Flemmy

4940
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
so what's on your mind tonight?

4941
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
The PlayStation All-Stars

4942
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
thingy majigger

4943
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
that's right so you're about to violate every NDA

4944
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
in the world it's not my NDA

4945
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
it's my friend's NDA

4946
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
I'm violating his NDA sounds very dirty

4947
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
technically by letting you play he's already violated

4948
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
the NDA there you go

4949
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
alright well given I'm not giving out

4950
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
his PSN I'm not giving out my PSN

4951
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
name so go tie it back

4952
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
to me Sony go well I

4953
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
I wouldn't throw down a challenge like that actually

4954
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
but so let's that was a joke

4955
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
so please don't you have

4956
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
allegedly played the beta

4957
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
yes allegedly

4958
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
so why don't you give us allegedly your thoughts

4959
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
um

4960
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
so right now the beta

4961
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
that I allegedly played

4962
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
very much feels like

4963
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
a lifeless Smash Brothers

4964
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
clone which you know

4965
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
not terrible I guess but it's not

4966
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
really fun yet which

4967
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
I think games are supposed to be fun

4968
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
last I heard why wasn't it fun?

4969
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
um

4970
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
because there's no charm to it yet

4971
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
even having Parappa

4972
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
in the beta the beta is only like six characters

4973
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
um and

4974
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
I've only seen two different stages so far

4975
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
but there's

4976
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
just I don't know it's

4977
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
a boring game

4978
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
and Smash Brothers to me is pretty boring to begin

4979
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
with so maybe I'm biased but

4980
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
I expected more you were telling

4981
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
me that the beta is only multiplayer

4982
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
correct? yeah I have to connect

4983
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
to somebody else I can't play against computer players

4984
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
now I have not tried to see if I could

4985
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
play like two people on the same console

4986
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
but part of the problem in the beta

4987
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
right now is you know when you play Smash

4988
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Brothers and you get like every

4989
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
person in like a tight area

4990
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
the camera zooms in it doesn't

4991
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
do that well in this game so

4992
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
it doesn't matter how close you are to the action

4993
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
your character is still really far away

4994
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
and it can make it very hard to figure out what's going

4995
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
on at any given time do you think

4996
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
that might have hurt your impressions a little bit though

4997
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
the fact you couldn't fuck around in single player

4998
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
at all? um

4999
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
no because

5000
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
ideally that style of game is

5001
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
just really

5002
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
multiplayer based I feel like

5003
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Smash Brothers isn't fun by yourself

5004
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
at all let's be real though

5005
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
being able to play online multiplayer is a

5006
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
feature that Smash Brothers I guess the

5007
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
one on the Wii had it but it didn't do it very

5008
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
well it was terrible it didn't really do it very well

5009
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
but to Smash Brothers credit

5010
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
and I'm not like you I like the

5011
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Smash Brothers games a lot but I

5012
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
think they're bad games I just I think they're overrated

5013
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
let's say that here's the thing

5014
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
that what I always loved about Smash Brothers is that

5015
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
they're very robust packages

5016
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
like there is

5017
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
so much in especially those

5018
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
most recent Smash Brothers games

5019
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
so many unlocks so many other modes

5020
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
so many like mini games and other

5021
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
things to experience you know and a lot

5022
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
of that was brought into Kid Icarus too

5023
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
so I think you know the projects

5024
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
that that team does tend to be very

5025
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
robust experiences

5026
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
and I think if Sony doesn't

5027
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
offer fans that same

5028
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
really rich experience

5029
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
which you're not going to see

5030
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
in such a limited beta I think

5031
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
you are going to feel short changed a little bit

5032
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
well and then

5033
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
one of the things I feel like they really get right

5034
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
are the stages I really

5035
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
like the fact that they change

5036
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
and kind of mix up

5037
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
different games in one stage like I was playing

5038
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
a god of no I was playing

5039
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
the Ratchet and Clank stage and all of a sudden

5040
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
it turned into God of War which is

5041
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
really cool and then

5042
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
one turned into like Padapon

5043
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
I don't remember which stage it also was but

5044
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
I really enjoyed that feature

5045
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
I just after now

5046
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
I didn't know about that leaked list of characters

5047
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
that people you know

5048
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
datamined from the beta I'm kind of sad

5049
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
that there aren't those real

5050
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
robust options

5051
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
that Smash Brothers offers but

5052
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I will probably get it because

5053
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I love that Dante and I will

5054
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
play as him even if he's a terrible character

5055
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
so despite everything you just said

5056
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
about not feeling super great about it

5057
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
you're going to buy it anyway

5058
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
because they're adding that Dante that's really really hot

5059
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
it was good enough to make you want to buy it

5060
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
in the end

5061
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
yes well I think it has potential and I think

5062
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
you know I'm not judging

5063
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
really purchasing it based on the beta

5064
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
because you can tell that the

5065
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
beta whatever build they're using is really

5066
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
early on there's a lot of like

5067
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
barren features

5068
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
in it so

5069
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
I don't know I just

5070
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
I'm not going to hate the game yet

5071
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
but it still needs to do more to wow me

5072
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I think they can pull it off though

5073
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
well we'll see what happens in the coming months

5074
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
hopefully there's a lot of good stuff to be

5075
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
unlocked and things we haven't seen yet

5076
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
and some of these characters in the leak sound

5077
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
potential which by the way I think

5078
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Shane coming on here and giving his

5079
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
alleged thoughts on the beta he may have allegedly

5080
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
played is a whole lot less of an infraction

5081
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
than whoever hacked the damn files

5082
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
to pull out those unlockable characters

5083
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
yeah and they had pictures of the stages too

5084
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
I kind of thought those stages were neat

5085
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
as the illegal secretary I approve

5086
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
of your legalese ass covering

5087
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
thank you

5088
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
I appreciate that

5089
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
I think we need to hire Marissa as a consultant for other

5090
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
shows in the future

5091
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
oh and Prab is awesome in it like

5092
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
he's really cool

5093
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
do you get to actually rap?

5094
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
no but okay remember

5095
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
that stupid boombox

5096
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
in the game that

5097
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
okay you get to throw him around

5098
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
and I like that because I hate that boombox

5099
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
is there a stage that's you waiting to use

5100
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
the toilet?

5101
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
not in the beta at least

5102
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
because that was like the funniest stage from the first

5103
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Parappa game remember? I love Parappa

5104
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
why won't they do another Parappa game?

5105
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
I need to go just as bad as you

5106
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
it seems like the perfect Playstation Network game

5107
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
the perfect goldmine for Sony is a

5108
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Parappa online game

5109
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
with little minisodes and stuff like that

5110
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
why is Sony not doing this?

5111
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
because Parappa 2 was not that

5112
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
good, they should do another Umjammer

5113
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Lammy because that game was amazing

5114
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
alright I'll take that, Umjammer Lammy is pretty

5115
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
fucking good

5116
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
I'm sad that she's not a leaked character, that would be really cool

5117
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
you know there's always

5118
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
DLC

5119
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
I will buy Umjammer Lammy DLC

5120
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
if I could get the one stage that everybody

5121
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
except for me hates as

5122
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
a stage you can play in the game I would be

5123
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
so excited

5124
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
shame before I let you go

5125
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
we have a question for you from

5126
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
playstation home summerfest

5127
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
blackwolf in

5128
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
playstation home says where is your

5129
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
rhythm thief review?

5130
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
in written form

5131
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
no no no no no no don't spoil it here

5132
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
I want it in written form

5133
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
no I'm not going to spoil my review

5134
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
here's the thing

5135
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
my 3DS is busted

5136
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
so yeah

5137
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
for some reason when I hit the B button

5138
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
it turns off which is usually the

5139
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
function of the off button

5140
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
but um

5141
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
don't say Alan, I can hear Alan

5142
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
laughing at what you just said all the way from the kitchen

5143
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
hello

5144
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
why?

5145
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
because the B button is, nevermind, forget it

5146
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
it sounds like you've got a short

5147
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
is what it sounds like yeah it does

5148
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
sometimes when I hold it funny it turns off

5149
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
I'm like whatever I just don't even want to play you

5150
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
um something inside there

5151
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
yeah and I couldn't find a screwdriver to open up

5152
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
because I would open it up

5153
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
wait yes you did spill something on your 3DS?

5154
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
no no no I didn't spill anything no no

5155
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
did the dog try to eat it?

5156
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I've got all these tri-wing screwdrivers just sitting in my house

5157
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
aw too bad he lives in Kansas

5158
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
um what I was going to say is

5159
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I will probably be getting an XL

5160
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
in two weeks thanks to my job

5161
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
so I'll start playing it again

5162
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
which we can't talk about

5163
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
any further on the show but I will

5164
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
talk to the other host about it off air

5165
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
it's like the 3DS but

5166
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
bigger

5167
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
alright moving on uh

5168
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
I guess that's it so when you get your

5169
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
3DS situation figured out we want the review

5170
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
now that it's not timely

5171
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
not

5172
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
my fault I can't even play

5173
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Pokemon do you know what a like a

5174
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
pain that is to me we really need more

5175
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
written content at VoG and granted I'm

5176
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
responsible for this too but I mean

5177
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
I've just had so much going on this week

5178
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
um but uh yeah if you have some time

5179
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
and you're interested in writing for VoG

5180
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
it doesn't have to be about video games it could be anything

5181
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
geeky movies books I would love

5182
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
somebody who reads a lot of books

5183
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
and even comic books and manga

5184
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I bought a book Rob

5185
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I bought um one of the Vampire

5186
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Hunter D novels that I hadn't read yet

5187
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
it doesn't have to be geeky books because my wife reads a lot of books

5188
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
but I mean like right now she does read

5189
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
a lot of geeky books she reads a lot of

5190
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
you know what your wife

5191
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
is hilarious so yes I don't

5192
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
care what it is she should do book reviews

5193
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
I should say this funny enough

5194
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
I'm seeking a book review

5195
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I actually am doing one for

5196
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
a friend site of VoG

5197
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
I'm just not done with the book yet but

5198
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out who

5199
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
but I'm hoping to have that done with him next week

5200
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
This is Fifty Shades of Grey

5201
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
It is not Fifty Shades of Grey

5202
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Then you need to redo your review

5203
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
We're like Fifty Shades of Shit

5204
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Fifty Shades of I'm Hanging Up On You Bye

5205
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Bye

5206
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Alright

5207
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Oh lordy how about one more call

5208
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
I don't think he mentioned Mass Effect at all

5209
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
He didn't

5210
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
That's awesome

5211
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Gotcha Shane

5212
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio

5213
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Who's this?

5214
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
This is Azoramay

5215
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Say that one more time?

5216
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Azoramay? Azoramay? What's on your mind tonight?

5217
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
I just wanted to

5218
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
I just noticed that

5219
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
there's going to be like a Final Fantasy 11

5220
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
like revival

5221
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
of music

5222
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
concert going on in your area

5223
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
and I was just wondering if you were aware of that

5224
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
I am very aware of that and I

5225
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
kind of sort of want to go actually

5226
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
it's just about you know if I can convince

5227
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
somebody else to go with me so I don't have to go

5228
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
by myself but yeah it's in Berkeley

5229
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
they're doing like a Final Fantasy 11

5230
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
You know what's funny? When I signed back up for the game

5231
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
about a month ago like I got those emails right away

5232
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
and then that's the log on message

5233
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
I don't know if everybody sees that or I just see it

5234
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
because I'm in the area

5235
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
but when I log into the game it says don't forget

5236
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
you have tickets on sale now for the Final Fantasy 11

5237
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
event in Berkeley!

5238
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
That is so funny because

5239
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
I'm a fan of it

5240
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
but I haven't really logged on it for a while

5241
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
I mean I got a letter

5242
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
via email about it

5243
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
I was really thinking about going

5244
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
but I'm on the East Coast in New York

5245
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
and I actually went to go see

5246
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
the

5247
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Distant Worlds at the Brooklyn Academy of Music

5248
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
and it was really great

5249
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
but like I said I have the same problem

5250
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
as you do trying to convince

5251
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
friends to actually go ahead and see it

5252
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
it's like a once in a lifetime

5253
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
opportunity

5254
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Would you think they're

5255
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
going to bring it out here at all?

5256
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
It really depends on this first one and if it does

5257
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
well that's kind of the deal if it makes money

5258
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
it'll tour

5259
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Here's something else to consider

5260
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
we're going back years and years

5261
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
so you can't really judge what's going on

5262
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
at Square now to these standards

5263
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
but when that first Dear Friends concert

5264
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
happened which was what? That was the first year

5265
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
I went to E3 so that was what? 04 I think?

5266
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
04 or 05? It was 04

5267
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
was Dear Friends

5268
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
and that Dear Friends concert

5269
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
was so good and so well received

5270
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
and so amazing and that

5271
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
in turn had been inspired by that

5272
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
what was it? It was the 222

5273
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
2002 concert they had in Japan

5274
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
that had the CD

5275
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
it did so well that they took that around

5276
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
the country and it was a

5277
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
good show and they took it to a lot of

5278
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
big cities however the next year

5279
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
they did a new show called More Friends

5280
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
that was at the Gibson Amphitheater

5281
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
I think at Universal Studios

5282
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
and I went to that as well because I

5283
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
loved the first one so much and More Friends

5284
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
wasn't good I mean

5285
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
it's not really the fault

5286
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
I don't want to fault the musicians

5287
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
I don't want to fault the guest stars

5288
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
I don't want to fault the talent behind it

5289
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
but just the production of it was

5290
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
really not good and a lot

5291
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
of that was acoustic problems

5292
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
and a lot of the sound problems

5293
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
and there was a lot of live issues and I heard

5294
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
you know I don't know how much truth

5295
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
there is to this stuff but I heard some dude

5296
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
got fired on the spot by Nobui

5297
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Matsu for how freaking terrible

5298
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
More Friends was and

5299
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Oh really? Wow I didn't know that

5300
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
They didn't take that on tour

5301
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
So it was like a once in a

5302
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
lifetime event

5303
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
Yes I can say it was a once

5304
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
in a lifetime event that I got to go to and

5305
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
I do consider myself lucky even though it was a bad

5306
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
show they actually had like the

5307
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
and I forget her name maybe you know it

5308
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
the lady from Final Fantasy 10 who sang

5309
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
that

5310
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
I can't remember the name of the song

5311
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
I'm sorry I can't say it again

5312
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Thank you

5313
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Yeah she was there singing it

5314
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
and so to hear that live was really

5315
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
amazing but that's

5316
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
you know and so I'm thankful

5317
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
for moments like that but

5318
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
I realize you know

5319
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:56,000
overall unfortunately the show was not a success

5320
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Oh okay well I mean that's kind of like

5321
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
all I really had to

5322
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
really ask Hey no it's a great question

5323
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
I'm tempted I will say

5324
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I'm very very tempted we'll see I'll let you know

5325
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
what I end up deciding

5326
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Alright thank you Alright take care

5327
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Take care Bye guy

5328
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Alright thank you so much for the calls tonight

5329
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through but send us an email

5330
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

5331
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
if you have a comment you want us to read on a future show

5332
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
when he phrases it that way

5333
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
he says it's a once in a lifetime opportunity

5334
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
and I do have to realize this is

5335
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
it might not be like totally my backyard

5336
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
but Xtaphir lives in

5337
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
Oakland Berkeley now I could totally like go stay with him

5338
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
for a night and go to the concert

5339
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
so maybe I should

5340
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
you know might not get the chance again

5341
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
and for somebody that wasn't a Final Fantasy 11 for so many years

5342
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
you give me a lot to think about

5343
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
a phone call to

5344
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Orangelaungeradio might just have sent me back about 50 bucks

5345
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
for a ticket we'll see

5346
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
we'll see

5347
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000

mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com

5351
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
it does mean we are getting very close

5352
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
to the end of the show

5353
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
we're getting close to the end of the party

5354
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
at Summerfest and Playstation Home

5355
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
last call last call everybody

5356
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
before we close

5357
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
out tonight I'm gonna ask

5358
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Loki if he has any last minute stories

5359
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
nope wow

5360
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
I didn't even look

5361
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
shame on you

5362
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
I couldn't think of anything that we didn't cover

5363
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
that was really really big

5364
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
I do have one of the tweet I will read that

5365
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
and that was from actdeft and it also reminds me to talk about this

5366
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
actdeft tweeted the show and said

5367
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
played beat hazard during the

5368
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
o-l-r break and start of part b

5369
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
quite fun and then he linked

5370
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
it on the steam community or he linked his

5371
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
picture on the steam community

5372
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
this was something I posted on the vog network

5373
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
forums if you're a fan of the game

5374
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
beat hazard and you have it on pc

5375
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
it is very easy to

5376
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
mod the game and it's not like

5377
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
you're not doing a bad thing you are editing

5378
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
text files to the developers like put instructions

5379
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
on how to edit it in there

5380
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
you can actually add your own internet

5381
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
radio feeds cause beat hazard you can play the

5382
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
internet radio and it's very easy to add

5383
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
vog network as a radio feed

5384
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
so yes you could play beat hazard

5385
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
to my voice

5386
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
but it's you know when there

5387
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
is no live or taped program on

5388
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
the voice of geeks network there is a music

5389
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
feed so it's really meant for that

5390
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
but some people are playing along to our voices which I think

5391
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
is kind of funny too so uh you can do

5392
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
that marathon mode

5393
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
so if you like yell something really fast

5394
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
or something that gets harder is that yes yes

5395
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
anti-disestablishmentarianism

5396
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:44,000
I actually do know what it means

5397
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
swear in Jewish frantically there might

5398
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
be a there might be a boss

5399
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:54,000
God that's hot

5400
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
you know it's funny that people think like oh you're Jewish

5401
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
you must have like grown up learning this no I know

5402
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
because I grew up in Los Angeles

5403
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
you know

5404
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
nice

5405
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
alright um

5406
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
if you need more information on how to mod that

5407
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
I posted something on our forums if you're not registered

5408
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
at vognetwork.com why not

5409
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
go get your loot at vognetwork.com

5410
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000

5411
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
further with the show in the forums

5412
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
and so forth misty in chat says

5413
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
Sky's voice the game goes beat hazard

5414
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
let's hope not

5415
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000

get to the end of the show but we are gonna go

5419
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
around one last time to get everybody's final

5420
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
thought starting with Marissa tonight

5421
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Marissa thank you so much for being on the show

5422
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
tonight and I think it is a-ok

5423
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
that you don't play a whole lot of games you're a

5424
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
nerdy enough girl and I mean that in the best

5425
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
possible way to fit right in with the family

5426
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
here at Orange Lawns Radio thank you for making

5427
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
me literally literally

5428
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
laugh my ass off tonight

5429
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
you're the best Marissa do you have any

5430
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
final thoughts for our listeners? I do take it as a high fob one actually I do

5431
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
I feel like I might need to explain

5432
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
myself a little bit to the audience especially all those

5433
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
new listeners please do

5434
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
I know some of you must be thinking who is this

5435
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
large breasted yappy singer-songwriter

5436
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
slutbag

5437
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
in reality

5438
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
I actually have a major confession to make

5439
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
I am a recovering

5440
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
comedian

5441
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
so that

5442
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
explains the majority of the material tonight

5443
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000

03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000

03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
codes right there in the chat room

5471
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000

03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
gotta get em go get em sorry

5473
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
I didn't think of a way to give em away earlier

5474
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
that's alright if you don't get one through there

5475
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
go to Joystiq they had an article a couple pages

5476
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
back that you can generate free codes

5477
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000

5478
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000

more final thoughts Loki your final

5481
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
thought since you have the mic

5482
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
speaking of Wednesday

5483
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Adams Wednesday happens to be

5484
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
August 1st

5485
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
happens to be when the 3rd gate opens

5486
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
oh shit the race is on

5487
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
do you have time off from work to do it?

5488
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
I took the day off well for multiple reasons I took the day off

5489
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
to take Josh

5490
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
cause it's his second

5491
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
birthday but also

5492
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
because I'm going to be staying up all night long finishing

5493
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
whatever game they have

5494
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
same reason I took

5495
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
September 25th off work

5496
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
understandable

5497
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
I hope

5498
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
the game is not hard enough

5499
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
for me where I can't finish it in one night

5500
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
cause I'm going to be disappointed if

5501
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
I have to stop

5502
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
playing to sleep or

5503
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
do other things

5504
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
but um

5505
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
I don't know

5506
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
who knows what it is no one knows I just hope it's not a crappy

5507
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
Facebook game please not be a crappy Facebook

5508
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
game cause that was already a

5509
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
crappy Facebook game for Gate 2 and I

5510
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
can't take another one I will just say

5511
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
I will throw over a table and just say fuck it

5512
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:42,000
