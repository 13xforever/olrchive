[SPEAKER_09]: They are very nice breasts.

45
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:48,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't mean to sound like a pig or whatever, but, I mean, seriously, girl.

46
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:51,649
[SPEAKER_04]: They entered the room before me.

47
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't forget to talk right into that microphone because it's not very sensitive, unfortunately, so they can barely hear you.

48
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,372
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not nearly as sensitive as Robb.

49
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:01,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Why am I not?

50
00:03:01,478 --> 00:03:01,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not here.

51
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the mic on over there?

52
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,861
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like very quiet for some reason.

54
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you just pick up Loki's mic?

55
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:09,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

56
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:09,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

57
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:11,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

58
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:11,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that better?

59
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:12,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Much better.

60
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:13,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I can actually hear you.

61
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:13,905
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

62
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:14,566
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you, Marissa?

63
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:15,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm great.

64
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:15,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

65
00:03:15,767 --> 00:03:17,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Despite the technical failure.

66
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:23,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you tell the boys and girls listening at home and in PlayStation Home, which I'll get to in a minute.

67
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:23,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't forgot you guys.

68
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:25,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you tell them about yourself real quick?

69
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:33,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm a music geek, singer-songwriter and collector of vinyl and all sorts of music.

70
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:38,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also, as far with regard to gaming, I'm an adventure game geek.

71
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and King's Quest and things as such.

72
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:52,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really that up to date with the modern stuff, but there have been some recent, not that recent, but adventure games, you hear a little blip about them every now and again.

73
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:59,461
[SPEAKER_09]: They're having a nice little renaissance thanks to a lot of the stuff that Telltale's been doing and the indie community especially has been very big on this.

74
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:04,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was the King's Quest fan thing, the silver lining, which was really awesome.

75
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:06,809
[SPEAKER_09]: The fan community is just great for that stuff.

76
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

77
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

78
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:12,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually I came up here specifically to see this band, Prylosis.

79
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:16,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anybody's in Sacramento, I highly recommend that you check them out.

80
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:17,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a metal band.

81
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,694
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also actually hilarious.

82
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:20,954
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a great YouTube channel.

83
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:25,315
[SPEAKER_04]: It's P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S.

84
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:28,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also Prylosis.com.

85
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:32,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And for anybody that's into metal music, I just had to recommend them because that was a lot of fun and they're fantastic.

86
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:35,878
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's more music geekery for me.

87
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:39,360
[SPEAKER_09]: That's no problem because now the network is about everything geek.

88
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Voice of Geeks.

89
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So a little music geekery on our show.

90
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,943
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a-okay, especially for metal fans.

91
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:51,306
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not even actually a metal fan by nature, but I really enjoyed it.

92
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:59,111
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really melodic, and it's just amazing, though, how one can expand your horizons, especially when it involves people that are really musically gifted.

93
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,892
[SPEAKER_09]: You do a lot of music playing yourself, right?

94
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I do a little bit of singer-songwriter stuff.

95
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitching about ex-boyfriends with an acoustic guitar and stuff like that.

96
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:10,077
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're like a Lilith Fair, basically.

97
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:14,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that bad, but... I'm doing a lot of jazz covers recently.

98
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a guitar player, and it's been a lot of fun.

99
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:21,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hanging out at this place called Kulak's Woodshed in North Hollywood, and they webcast actually live all their shows.

100
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:22,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

101
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of a singer-songwriter deal as well.

102
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:26,568
[SPEAKER_09]: PlayStation Home Summerfest PlayStation Home Summerfest

103
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:49,009
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

104
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:07,229
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

105
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:33,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in PlayStation Home during his show and just kind of really seeing the community.

106
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,138
[SPEAKER_09]: It was almost like watching an episode of Cheers where people would show up.

107
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:41,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Norm!

108
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody really seemed to know each other.

109
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:43,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was really cool.

110
00:06:44,745 --> 00:07:13,501
[SPEAKER_09]: and I in a way I felt like an outsider but like everybody was super welcoming it was like saying hello and I was talking about VOG and people were actually pretty receptive during Bobby's show he got a caller from somebody that had like never listened to VOG before but was listening because of PlayStation Home and I just thought that was like a great cross promotional opportunity so if you are listening live and you are in PlayStation Home I do want to point out Bobby Blackwolf is in there now and he's going to be feeding me comments about

111
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

112
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:52,287
[SPEAKER_09]: of course if you want to do things the old fashioned way nothing wrong with that I'm not going to ignore you guys in our always present chat room live.vognetwork.com is where the traditional IRC based chat room is if you want to join that and chat along with the show you can also check in to the show at VOG Network as we are live here and get your VOG points and maybe a little bit of loot

113
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:53,708
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

114
00:07:54,469 --> 00:08:02,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Stan in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com starts us off tonight saying, Rob, is there a way to stream the live podcast on PlayStation Home?

115
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:03,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'll switch if I can.

116
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:11,099
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, sadly, I don't think that's something that's possible yet because I don't think you can really do like streaming music or any of that yet.

117
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:19,265
[SPEAKER_09]: We should all let Sony know that's something we want in the future though because how awesome would it be if in that VOG Network clubhouse we could actually have like a VOG Network feed.

118
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:20,726
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be like the best thing ever.

119
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,227
[SPEAKER_09]: So who knows?

120
00:08:22,267 --> 00:08:23,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything's possible in the future.

121
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:30,954
[SPEAKER_09]: So Blackwolf is reporting that from PlayStation Home that the club channels just died again.

122
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:33,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Our party is crashing the servers, y'all.

123
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know how to party or what?

124
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, so yes, again, a big hello to you guys at PlayStation Home who are listening tonight.

125
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me throw out some names I remember from before.

126
00:08:47,381 --> 00:08:57,523
[SPEAKER_09]: MandaPanda, Jay, Steven, Junebug, that guy who had the 91 on the back of his shirt that made me feel insignificant.

127
00:08:57,643 --> 00:08:58,123
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just kidding.

128
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:02,824
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I want to say hi to all you guys who are listening right now.

129
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:29,566
[SPEAKER_09]: all right um and also some of the uh OL Army and VOG regulars are in home summer fest right now I saw Tiger Claw in there earlier and I saw um Spaznator and some of the other people so that's pretty cool there's kind of the cross promotion stuff going on so that's what it's all about it's just promoting community and and cool people meeting other cool people I know PlayStation Home has had its share of you know some people still don't get it and I even admit I I've

130
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:30,666
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

131
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:00,749
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

132
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:11,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we get started with tonight's show, I wanted to do a quick kickoff topic, which I think might have been just saying hello to Marissa and interviewing her a little bit.

133
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:13,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, Marissa.

134
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So you like adventure games.

135
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:15,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

136
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,417
[SPEAKER_09]: What is your favorite video game ever?

137
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does have to be Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

138
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I really just love that game.

139
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a thing for Harrison Ford?

140
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:25,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be real.

141
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:27,851
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I have a thing for fedoras.

142
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,073
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.

143
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:30,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, I left mine out in the car.

144
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,177
[SPEAKER_09]: No, true story.

145
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:41,149
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my other passions besides like internet radio and video games and all that, I have been a member of like live shadow casting for midnight movies like Rocky Horror Picture Show especially, right?

146
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:41,870
[SPEAKER_09]: For like

147
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,030
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 years.

148
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:52,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, lately I've started doing stuff with Repo the Genetic Opera, which is, you know, one of the, yeah, that's kind of, I hate, I hate calling it the new Rocky Horror because it's not.

149
00:10:52,373 --> 00:10:56,555
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a new, cool phenomenon that also happens to be at midnight.

150
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Delays in shadow casting.

151
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:58,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

152
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,756
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like the shadow casting thing of the now.

153
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:07,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And last night they did the 80s Repo show and I got to do Indiana Jones in a special cameo, which was awesome.

154
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:09,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bring your whip?

155
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,299
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

156
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:37,976
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a joke where the Paris Hilton character, Amber Sweet, is kind of like a dominatrix So they did a joke where I came out as Indiana Jones and she stole my whip That was kind of the joke, which was super cute But the audience cheered and I felt hot Awesome It was a good time Anyhow, let's get to video games Speaking of games, I know where to start this week Loki, I want to talk to you for a minute

157
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:45,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so, you've been talking for weeks about this contest, this competition you were going to be at this weekend.

158
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear about it.

159
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,120
[SPEAKER_09]: How did it go?

160
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It was terrible.

161
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what was this that you went to?

162
00:11:50,723 --> 00:11:53,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I went to a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 contest.

163
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:54,805
[SPEAKER_06]: It was going to be two on two.

164
00:11:55,806 --> 00:12:02,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, for a while I was trying to find someone to go with and I had my, one of my friend's brothers was going to go with me.

165
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And so everything sounded cool because he plays a lot of, you know, Call of Duty.

166
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:09,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, I play quite a bit and, you know,

167
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:11,856
[SPEAKER_06]: The rules were a little weird.

168
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:17,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It was basically custom classes, but there were certain restrictions on what kind of loadout you can have.

169
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:18,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was fine.

170
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:26,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I practiced with the loadout that I could work with in the rules of the tournament.

171
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:28,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was kind of ready.

172
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:29,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I had everything set up.

173
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so here comes Friday.

174
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:34,663
[SPEAKER_06]: The Friday before the tournament.

175
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:40,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally about 2 o'clock, my co-op partner drops out.

176
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:43,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have no one to go with.

177
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:45,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, fantastic.

178
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I call my friend Sean.

179
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:52,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, hey, does your other brother play?

180
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:54,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, yeah, he plays.

181
00:12:55,286 --> 00:12:56,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if he can go.

182
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,407
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he's got things he's doing.

183
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

184
00:13:00,687 --> 00:13:01,608
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's fine.

185
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:09,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just find someone to play with when I go down there, or I'll play one against two.

186
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:10,755
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be okay.

187
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take them both on.

188
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:14,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, with the loadout I had.

189
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,740
[SPEAKER_09]: These guys are going to all be, what, 16?

190
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take them all.

191
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:45,120
[SPEAKER_06]: So I drove down there, like an hour and a half down to Stockton And so I'm at the shopping center where this place is and I can't find it at first So I look up on Facebook because this plaza is actually on both sides of the street I'm like, oh, it's probably on the other side of the street, let me just look up where it's at So when I go to look it up, I notice that there's an update in the events Oh, by the way, we changed all the rules

192
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:47,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, how convenient!

193
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you!

194
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:48,867
[SPEAKER_06]: How convenient!

195
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're all, oh, by the way, now we're not doing custom classes, we're just doing the standard classes that are there.

196
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And with no restrictions.

197
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:58,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

198
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I drove all the, I'm like, fine.

199
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:00,814
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

200
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I drove all this way, I'm gonna play at least.

201
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So I get there, sign up and everything.

202
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:07,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, now we're gonna not do killstreaks.

203
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

204
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

205
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:54,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I had been practicing with a certain class all week long per expectations to a tournament and then they fucking switched it all up on me so I'm like god damn it I don't know what fucking class I'm going to play.

206
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:56,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And did they ask you, you mad, brah?

207
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, oh, it gets better than that.

208
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets better.

209
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, so what the hell?

210
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you guys change the instructions?

211
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:08,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, it's actually supposed to be standard classes all along, but that's what we've been telling everybody that's been coming in here, you know, the past few weeks.

212
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:17,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the past few weeks, so you've known about this shit, and you've been telling everybody, oh, but you fucking failed to update it on Facebook so that, you know, people that were coming out of town would know anything about it.

213
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:22,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know, I'm just working here.

214
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a big fucking mess.

215
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:29,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, I didn't enjoy myself, but at least I didn't spend that much time in Stockton.

216
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So I played for a few minutes, I got to meet with my customer that was down there, and I left, and that was it.

217
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:57,308
[SPEAKER_09]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the rage gauge is nearing critical DJ Morpheus is counting the number of F-bombs that you're dropping I do want to remind, because we do have an influx of new listeners tonight thanks in large part to the PlayStation Home Summerfest I just want to remind everybody it is a mature audiences show so please put the kids to bed or put headphones on

218
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:58,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be honest.

219
00:15:58,794 --> 00:15:59,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

220
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:02,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's people that I've been to video game tournaments before.

221
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:05,923
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't go to a tournament that changes the fucking rules.

222
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:06,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, that's messed up.

223
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:08,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 10 minutes before the tournament starts.

224
00:16:08,446 --> 00:16:14,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Like back in the day, if it was like a DDR tournament, like, oh man, that tournament would have been smeared on DDR Freak the next day.

225
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:16,577
[SPEAKER_06]: The next day?

226
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:17,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The same day.

227
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:18,638
[SPEAKER_09]: The same day.

228
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:20,259
[SPEAKER_09]: It was ridiculous.

229
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't have live blogging back in that day.

230
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,420
[SPEAKER_09]: But we had laptops at tournaments.

231
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,482
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, no one else was pissed there except for me because everybody else there was local.

232
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:33,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they had been in the shop at least a couple times before tournaments started.

233
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:36,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were aware of the change in the rules.

234
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But no one fucking mentioned it at all.

235
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,866
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really annoying.

236
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:41,606
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever.

237
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:42,066
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

238
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:44,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I contemplate.

239
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, do I really want to drive down to Stockton since it's just going to be myself?

240
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:53,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to point out, Wicked is in our chat room right now saying, yay, Loki was in my neck of the woods.

241
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:56,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So you are bashing one of our listeners' hometowns right now.

242
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:57,393
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's be real.

243
00:16:58,073 --> 00:17:00,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, bro, you live in Stockton.

244
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:01,774
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

245
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Your city's bankrupt.

246
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it this way.

247
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,696
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the tournament seemed like a good portion of Stockton.

248
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:12,516
[SPEAKER_06]: The shopping mall was actually pretty nice.

249
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:15,657
[SPEAKER_06]: A compliment from Loki, everybody!

250
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,357
[SPEAKER_06]: The mall was nice!

251
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it by the S-Mart?

252
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:23,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the S-Mart is.

253
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:24,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And the game store was nice.

254
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:27,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, unfortunately, you have an idiot running your goddamn tournaments.

255
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,699
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only problem.

256
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:35,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, it may very well be that this guy's new to running tournaments because I hear that their fighting game tournaments run okay.

257
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, I'm sure they're not switching up the rules.

258
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,467
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be funny.

259
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:43,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, let's go play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 tournament.

260
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:52,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and the reason, too, the reason that they changed up all the rules is because, oh, well, we didn't want someone to say, oh, well, the only reason you won is because you got this kill streak and the helicopter killed me.

261
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,171
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

262
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,883
[SPEAKER_06]: to change the rules at the very last second because, oh, we don't want to hear someone bitch and whine.

263
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:22,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

264
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:29,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fucking hearing me bitch and whine about it now because I had to drive 90 fucking minutes to your stupid tournament, which I will.

265
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:35,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and by the way, I love my customer, but she's like, so are you coming back for Stockton Fest?

266
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:38,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, no, I'm not fucking coming back to Stockton Fest.

267
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not driving to Stockton ever again.

268
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:45,855
[SPEAKER_09]: When I drive to LA, I will drive around Stockton.

269
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,635
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time I went to Stockton, someone stole my Xbox.

270
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,736
[SPEAKER_06]: This time I went to Stockton, fucking tournaments sucked.

271
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not coming back to Stockton.

272
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:56,497
[SPEAKER_06]: There will not be a three strike law here.

273
00:18:56,557 --> 00:18:58,158
[SPEAKER_06]: This is two strikes, we're done.

274
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going back to Stockton.

275
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:04,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Wicked in our chat says, trust me, if I didn't have to live here, I wouldn't.

276
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, trust me, I'm sure, it's just, it has nothing to do with Stockton, this could have been run in Sacramento and had an idiot running tournament, it doesn't matter, it's just, you don't fucking change the rules at the last second.

277
00:19:20,603 --> 00:19:25,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And okay, if you're going to change the rule, I can understand if it was like, hey, you know what, you guys?

278
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:32,353
[SPEAKER_06]: We said all these restrictions are in place, but we're just going to lift the restrictions now.

279
00:19:32,634 --> 00:19:40,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's not so bad because I can still play with the class I had or I can change it up a little bit instead of, oh, by the way, now you have to stick to one of these six classes.

280
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:46,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and that sucked and you can at least get some killstreaks and stuff, but we're going to take those away too.

281
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:50,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Wicked in our chat room says, Aw, you won't come back to Stockton?

282
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:52,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even if I bake cookies?

283
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:52,748
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

284
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:54,189
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

285
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

286
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:55,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

287
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,653
[SPEAKER_03]: With his luck, he'd probably get food poisoning and vomit all over the entire town.

288
00:19:59,673 --> 00:20:04,396
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna have to broker like a Loki Stockton peace summit in like Lodi or something.

289
00:20:06,112 --> 00:20:06,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

290
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,273
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have to figure that one out.

291
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:08,753
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, look.

292
00:20:09,193 --> 00:20:10,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Too many local jokes.

293
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:12,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a worldwide show.

294
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:22,759
[SPEAKER_06]: The rule, I mean, just the lesson to be learned here is just you got to be, I guess you have to be aware of how the, whatever local store is running a tournament, how they handle things.

295
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, I mean, and honestly, no one should be changing rules last second.

296
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:31,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed they deleted the event on Facebook so no one can comment on it or anything.

297
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:34,965
[SPEAKER_09]: They must have had a few angry people.

298
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:36,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Who won?

299
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:38,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

300
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:39,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't going to stick around.

301
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:40,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, who cares?

302
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt bad for the guy that was playing.

303
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:45,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, well, because it's like the second game.

304
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:51,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it was... Oh, and that was the other thing they changed, too, because it was single elimination first, and then it was like, oh, best two out of three now.

305
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, is it best two out of three or single elimination?

306
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's best two out of three, then if you lose once, then you're out.

307
00:20:57,951 --> 00:20:58,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

308
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,072
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

309
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:01,433
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't even make sense.

310
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:07,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoever loses the best two out of three or wins the best two out of three moves on, then the loser is done.

311
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:14,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So we lost our first round because it was like, okay, let's try to get ahead.

312
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were doing all right.

313
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it wasn't like we lost by a whole ton.

314
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:26,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still quite a few points, but it wasn't like we had 100 points and they had 2,500 or something.

315
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty decent.

316
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:32,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had already lost our first game, so that put us at a disadvantage for the second round.

317
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:38,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the second round, it's like, well, we have to come to them because they're not, you know, in order to win this.

318
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:41,056
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it just, unfortunately, we had the advantage there.

319
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,457
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we have a comment coming out of PlayStation Home.

320
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:45,297
[SPEAKER_09]: The man Bobby Blackwolf is in.

321
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,859
[SPEAKER_09]: He does the show before us Sunday nights on VOG Network.

322
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:53,360
[SPEAKER_09]: He is in PlayStation Home right now feeding me comments because I can't see the TV.

323
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,961
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too far away.

324
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:54,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in there doing the running.

325
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,002
[SPEAKER_09]: A circle of running men just sounds dirty too.

326
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,232
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

327
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:39,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew, Zynga game.

328
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:41,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

329
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:41,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Judging you.

330
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:42,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

331
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:43,959
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know it's popular.

332
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:44,920
[SPEAKER_09]: It's real popular.

333
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's popular.

334
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,042
[SPEAKER_02]: It's addicting.

335
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:48,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing a really addictive game.

336
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:53,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm like cutting and talking about something in my week real quick, but I've been playing... Well, no, this is important.

337
00:22:53,927 --> 00:22:57,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing... When don't I ever make a topic about me, DarkSakura?

338
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though I've been, what, 10 years?

339
00:22:59,272 --> 00:22:59,532
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

340
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:00,693
[SPEAKER_09]: More than that.

341
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,637
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a game on iPhone called SongPop.

342
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:05,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Zynga

343
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:21,915
[SPEAKER_09]: How long before Zynga buys them?

344
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:57,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about Facebook real quick Facebook, in case anyone hasn't fucking noticed is a little broken right now because you cannot unsubscribe from people's comments and likes or updates by games

345
00:23:58,141 --> 00:23:58,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I try.

346
00:23:58,942 --> 00:24:01,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't fucking care about your stupid song game or whatever.

347
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:04,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to hide that shit, but Facebook does not want to let me do it.

348
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:05,426
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny?

349
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:07,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I set all that shit to private.

350
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:09,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, are you seeing my song pop shit?

351
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:10,149
[SPEAKER_06]: No, other people.

352
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:10,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

353
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:10,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby.

354
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:16,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mind that kind of stuff.

355
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:19,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mainly people commenting on other people's cat photos.

356
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:22,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I really don't care if you think that's a cute cat or not.

357
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:27,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Facebook's problem because all that stuff was hidden before and now it's not.

358
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:33,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make it known that this is an issue so everybody can also make it known to their friends that this is an issue because...

359
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:36,083
[SPEAKER_06]: No one seems to be fixing it.

360
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been like this for a week.

361
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:40,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the real issue is that I heard this went into place a couple weeks ago.

362
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:45,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say you're in a group and you make a post in that group.

363
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:48,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can see when everybody read that post.

364
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:52,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think that's like a privacy violation.

365
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Surprise!

366
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to stalk people with impunity.

367
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:58,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly!

368
00:24:58,673 --> 00:25:00,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see that too with messages.

369
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:02,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Direct messages that you send to people on Facebook.

370
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see if they've read it or not.

371
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:08,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to good old-fashioned anonymous ignoring you?

372
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:14,089
[SPEAKER_04]: How are people going to be able to check in on their ex and then be upset if they're living a nice life?

373
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:17,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like those emails with read receipts and stuff like that.

374
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:19,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I love deleting those before they get sent.

375
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,280
[SPEAKER_04]: That's terrible.

376
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:27,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, I have to bitch about Facebook, too, because they're totally fucking over page owners right now.

377
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:37,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that they're a for-profit entity and they have to make money, but I operate several pages myself for musicians and one for a venue that I work for.

378
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,038
[SPEAKER_09]: That mic is cutting in and out.

379
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:41,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.

380
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:43,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Live radio, kids.

381
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:46,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Love ya.

382
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:52,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I operate several pages for musicians and for venues that I work for.

383
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:57,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely understand that Facebook is a for-profit entity and they need to make money.

384
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:59,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be happy to pay for extra features.

385
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:07,369
[SPEAKER_04]: However, to pay for just basic exposure that would normally, if you were on a friend's page, would just go out to all of your friends is bullshit.

386
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:07,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

387
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,651
[SPEAKER_09]: On Facebook, you pay with your soul.

388
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:11,931
[SPEAKER_04]: This is true.

389
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:12,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to argue that.

390
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,433
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you like your Farmville now?

391
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:17,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree.

392
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:22,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, page owners, if you didn't know that already, your posts aren't getting completed.

393
00:26:23,018 --> 00:26:24,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Zuckerberg is watching you masturbate.

394
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:25,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Shalom.

395
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:28,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm allowed to say that.

396
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:31,851
For the record.

397
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:44,620
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I mean, for any page owners that didn't know this earlier, unless you're paying for their extra services, you make a post on your page, it's not going to reach your whole audience at all.

398
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, we really just need a show on VOG where we giggle for an hour.

399
00:26:48,062 --> 00:26:50,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Giggle time!

400
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Giggle time!

401
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dear, what have I started?

402
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Tickle Fest!

403
00:26:58,331 --> 00:26:58,491
Yay!

404
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:00,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

405
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:01,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, I found a Garrus shirt.

406
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, this was DarkSakura's gaming week at one point.

407
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:04,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck all that.

408
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking up Mass Effect t-shirts.

409
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:13,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Jamie did introduce... I was not familiar with Mass Effect, and Jamie did introduce me to that character's glorious baritone.

410
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,900
[SPEAKER_04]: He is lovely.

411
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lovely voice.

412
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:22,126
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that was his voice actor was on an episode of Buffy as like this real douchebag who was like this horrible character.

413
00:27:22,286 --> 00:27:22,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

414
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was in season seven, so it doesn't count.

415
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:26,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you let Garrus calibrate your heart?

416
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:29,870
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a very nice lower register, that's all I can say.

417
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then, Marissa, I'll ask you about your gaming week.

418
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:34,473
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like you got exposed to Mass Effect a little bit.

419
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:34,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

420
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:38,376
[SPEAKER_03]: My new wallpaper, by the way, is the Citadel smooch.

421
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:40,417
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?

422
00:27:40,697 --> 00:27:47,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching other people play Modern Warfare and then getting yelled at for stealing their bandwidth has pretty much been the rest of my gaming week.

423
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:50,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddammit, are you on the internet?

424
00:27:50,063 --> 00:27:50,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

425
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:57,075
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like Sunday nights at OLR when Alan mistakenly downloads BitTorrents.

426
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:58,256
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn it, are you getting porn?

427
00:27:58,876 --> 00:27:59,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to do a show.

428
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to hack into our neighbor's connection.

429
00:28:03,878 --> 00:28:07,399
[SPEAKER_04]: His connection's name is Uncle Touchy's Puzzle Basement.

430
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,499
[SPEAKER_04]: But I haven't been able to figure out his code yet.

431
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:11,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Pat Moswell joke.

432
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm like... As long as it's WP or WBA, you can hack it pretty easy.

433
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

434
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:19,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I can send you the link.

435
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:21,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Lifehacker had an article on it.

436
00:28:22,374 --> 00:28:22,694
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

437
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,055
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go move on to Loki.

438
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week besides Stockton?

439
00:28:28,617 --> 00:28:30,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Stockton just was unfortunate.

440
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even finish mine.

441
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:34,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were done.

442
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you.

443
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck everybody.

444
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

445
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:40,401
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

446
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:40,981
[SPEAKER_06]: You're done.

447
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:41,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so...

448
00:28:45,606 --> 00:28:47,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to walk away so I wouldn't time out of home.

449
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,229
[SPEAKER_09]: You said, and I quote, I've just been playing Mass Effect.

450
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I might have played other things.

451
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you say, I just played Mass Effect.

452
00:28:57,672 --> 00:29:00,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I did just play Mass Effect before we left the house.

453
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,074
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.

454
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,915
[SPEAKER_09]: She made it sound like just in... Oh, forget it.

455
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:06,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not having a grammar war with this woman.

456
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:07,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, lady.

457
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:09,978
[SPEAKER_09]: How was the rest of your gaming week?

458
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:10,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Uneventful.

459
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:15,523
[SPEAKER_06]: She is a level 50 grammar knight, by the way.

460
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:19,564
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a level 50 bitch right now is what she is.

461
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Rob.

462
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:20,084
69.

463
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:20,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

464
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:21,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch is a subclass.

465
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:25,806
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to put a B in a circle on the back of your shirt when you go into PlayStation Home.

466
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:26,266
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

467
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:28,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

468
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, do I have permission to move on to the show?

469
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Carry on.

470
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:32,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Carry on.

471
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:32,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

472
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:33,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

473
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:36,070
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you enjoying hosting the Olympics, your queen?

474
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,671
[SPEAKER_09]: All these countries used to be mine.

475
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:48,955
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have to do the proper All of these countries used to be mine We are not amused

476
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,026
[SPEAKER_09]: May the odds be ever in your favor!

477
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:14,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

478
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:43,675
[SPEAKER_06]: FireCrotch

479
00:30:58,722 --> 00:31:00,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have roasted sausage.

480
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:07,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, now, now, I used to, I have a cooling pad they put on there, but yes, before when I used to.

481
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:08,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Icy hot?

482
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:13,948
[SPEAKER_06]: No, a metal pad with fans in it.

483
00:31:14,428 --> 00:31:23,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, no, but when I had, before I had all the cooling modifications to it, I would burn my legs playing games on my laptop.

484
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,313
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, that's, it is possible to do that.

485
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:55,395
[SPEAKER_06]: and it got so hot too that like I was burning my hands not touching my laptop on top of my keys it was just getting that hot I'm like okay starting to smell things burning probably should cool it off wow so yeah so I think we're good we're in a good spot now because all the other spots that I haven't drilled holes in don't really have any processors underneath them so it's probably not necessary and then played Minecraft a bit more of that that's kind of fun we just started kind of exploring the area and the new

486
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Octocock Minecraft Scene Beta Key for LittleBigPlanet

487
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:18,930
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

488
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty much it.

489
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:24,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a lot of stuff.

490
00:32:25,296 --> 00:32:30,541
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of it was just hinging on cooling my laptop down so I can play more Borderlands again because it's just getting so hot.

491
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I don't want to break anything in there.

492
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:33,270
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

493
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let me talk about my gaming week.

494
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:37,331
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Borderlands a little bit.

495
00:32:37,431 --> 00:32:40,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really busy during the weekend because of the shadow casting events going on this weekend.

496
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:44,813
[SPEAKER_09]: But earlier in the week, I played Borderlands like a little more seriously this time.

497
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:46,753
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not a lot, a lot.

498
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:51,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I only probably got to like level 10 or 11, which, you know, is chump change in the scope of things.

499
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:54,695
[SPEAKER_09]: But it gave me enough time to get a better feel for the game than what I'd played of it before.

500
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:55,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like it.

501
00:32:55,776 --> 00:32:56,436
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like...

502
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:05,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the description of World of Warcraft as a first-person shooter is somewhat accurate, except it's not really an MMO, but you can play the multiplayer.

503
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:11,221
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the only thing that felt a little disjointed for me, and this is going to sound negative, but it's really not.

504
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:18,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I do really enjoy the game, you guys, but I kind of thought it was weird that you can use the same character in your single-player and in multiplayer.

505
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:45,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you can use different too but it was it just felt a little disjointed like here I am doing some quests as single player and then here we are multiplayer and so-and-so's kind of off doing this and so-and-so's off doing this and kind of like we're all completing quests I'm not able to really follow along I'm not able to get into it as easy so it's kind of like I feel the need to play through this game once single player just to like know the story and know everything and then go back and do multiplayer and I

506
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, for real, GameSpy is the multiplayer client?

507
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:49,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what is this, 1998?

508
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:56,040
[SPEAKER_09]: But okay, I realize the game is a few years old.

509
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:01,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping Borderlands 2 uses something a little more modern.

510
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:01,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

511
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:04,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

512
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:50,233
[SPEAKER_09]: that you know remember I said I was playing a lot of Mass Effect multiplayer and it makes me want to play a first-person shooter because I really enjoy Mass Effect and the most people suggested I play Borderlands I think it was a great suggestion it is a little more first-person shootery than I'm used to and I was surprised I couldn't dumb the difficulty down because I like to play my shooters in easy noob noob mode but there is no difficulty you can do that yeah you gotta hacks it though you gotta hacks it I don't want to do that it's it's all right I didn't want to do that it's

513
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:51,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing alright so far.

514
00:34:51,534 --> 00:34:53,836
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just multiplayer kicked our butt.

515
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:55,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, because the enemies get so much stronger.

516
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:58,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's not just one guy running around not knowing what they're doing.

517
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It's three.

518
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:00,682
[SPEAKER_09]: This is me and two buddies of mine.

519
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:01,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to play.

520
00:35:02,323 --> 00:35:04,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, we can certainly play later on.

521
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:05,406
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Bobby's got it.

522
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:06,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan's got it now.

523
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:08,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of people in the borderlands.

524
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:12,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, for me, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff.

525
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, not a lot of new, new stuff this week.

526
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:17,113
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, World of Warcraft and all that good stuff.

527
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:23,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm eagerly awaiting, thanks to Loki, I got a beta test code for the little big planet karting.

528
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Super excited to try that out.

529
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Play it as quickly as possible because it ends, like, Wednesday.

530
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:27,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no!

531
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:29,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll download it tonight.

532
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:31,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Play it Monday and Tuesday night or something.

533
00:35:31,442 --> 00:35:33,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Let you guys know my impressions on that next week.

534
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:37,565
[SPEAKER_09]: That ought to be of interest to the PlayStation Home folks, because that's a Sony exclusive.

535
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:39,725
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some codes that we can give away too.

536
00:35:39,825 --> 00:35:41,266
[SPEAKER_09]: You say we have extra codes to give away?

537
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:41,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we do.

538
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:48,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we need to do a giveaway tonight in the PlayStation Home clubhouse.

539
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:49,629
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be fun.

540
00:35:50,988 --> 00:35:52,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like three extra codes?

541
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:55,133
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll think of a way to do a contest.

542
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:57,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to ignore the folks in our live chat room either.

543
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll give some codes away in some different places tonight.

544
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess Marissa's cup size is the contest?

545
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:07,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I can guess what it is.

546
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:11,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that, alright.

547
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:20,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta keep it, we might be a mature show, but I wanna keep it somewhat PG-13 at least at home.

548
00:36:20,532 --> 00:36:23,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of respect to the community, I wanna keep it a little PG-13 there.

549
00:36:23,977 --> 00:36:26,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Too big is the answer.

550
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:26,981
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

551
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:31,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane is messaging me going, I want a freaking code.

552
00:36:32,226 --> 00:36:40,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Shane, that's what you get for bragging about the PlayStation All-Stars Network Battle Royale thingy that you were in the beta for.

553
00:36:40,414 --> 00:36:41,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, let me play.

554
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:42,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what his answer was?

555
00:36:42,997 --> 00:36:43,157
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

556
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:43,678
No.

557
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:48,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Geras Geras Geras

558
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:13,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So next week, after Orange Lounge Radio, that's right, after Orange Lounge Radio, I think we've been doing this show like 10 years.

559
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we ever had another show follow us?

560
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:17,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Like usually we're the last show of the night, right?

561
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:18,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Because like 1 a.m.

562
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:20,904
[SPEAKER_09]: on the East Coast by the time we're done sometimes.

563
00:37:21,284 --> 00:37:27,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, next week, there is going to be a special show following us at vognetwork.com.

564
00:37:27,726 --> 00:37:28,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's very late.

565
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:31,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a long time to stay up, but this is very cool.

566
00:37:32,248 --> 00:37:34,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Travis Donovan from Under Sedation Live.

567
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:40,636
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to be doing a special live VOG coverage of the Mars Curiosity landing.

568
00:37:41,077 --> 00:37:42,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's really cool.

569
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:43,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, it's a little bit of space.

570
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:50,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Travis, if you listen to Under Station Live at all, which is on Saturday nights at VOG, 7 o'clock Pacific, he loves space.

571
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,530
[SPEAKER_09]: He loves NASA.

572
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:52,452
[SPEAKER_09]: He loves the space program.

573
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he the best at space?

574
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:54,053
[SPEAKER_09]: He might be.

575
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:56,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, by the way, before I forget, rest in peace, Sally Ride.

576
00:37:56,655 --> 00:37:57,035
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

577
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:57,735
[SPEAKER_09]: For real.

578
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Sally Ride.

579
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:04,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, not just all the stuff that came out afterwards, but just Sally Ride.

580
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:07,581
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I was around like five or six when she first went into space.

581
00:38:08,382 --> 00:38:08,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

582
00:38:10,152 --> 00:38:12,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how to put this.

583
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:18,655
[SPEAKER_09]: At such a young age, you're even so happy to see a female go into space.

584
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:24,677
[SPEAKER_09]: You kind of wonder as a kid, on one hand, you wonder, why is it such a big deal?

585
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:29,479
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the other hand, you feel a lot of happiness and pride for that equality.

586
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:31,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember feeling that at a young age.

587
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,800
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not even a girl.

588
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I was a feminist at five years old.

589
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:35,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knew?

590
00:38:35,341 --> 00:38:36,902
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, Sally Ride.

591
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing inspiration to men and women everywhere.

592
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:48,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I really that out of current events that I didn't realize that we had sent another, like... Oh, another show.

593
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,333
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a one-time special.

594
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:50,794
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

595
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:51,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that.

596
00:38:51,235 --> 00:38:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about sending something to Mars.

597
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:57,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even realize that we had sent anything else to Mars.

598
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:01,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were like, ah, we fucked up that last rover.

599
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:02,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

600
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:03,266
I mean...

601
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:04,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's cool.

602
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:06,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's amazing.

603
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

604
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:10,537
[SPEAKER_09]: You should tune in to Travis' special next week.

605
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:11,717
[SPEAKER_09]: You might learn something.

606
00:39:11,737 --> 00:39:14,138
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes sense that now they have all these Mars landing games.

607
00:39:14,158 --> 00:39:16,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, who cares about landing on Mars now?

608
00:39:16,078 --> 00:39:17,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's like so old.

609
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:21,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And what the hell is the world turning to when I'm learning things from Travis Donovan?

610
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:23,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you.

611
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:24,415
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

612
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:27,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did want to plug that.

613
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:31,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, I want to plug our Facebook community, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

614
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are on Twitter as well.

615
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:38,264
[SPEAKER_09]: You can follow us at OLR or you can follow the Voice of Geeks Network as a whole, VOG Network.

616
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:43,467
[SPEAKER_09]: VOG Network did grow in the past couple weeks with a few new shows, Critical Myth and British Invaders.

617
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:44,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to give them a shout out.

618
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:48,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, great television and discussion shows.

619
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:51,873
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both fantastic shows and so happy to have them on the lineup.

620
00:39:52,353 --> 00:40:11,173
[SPEAKER_09]: and of course one more shout out to the folks right now doing the running man or just hanging out whatever they're doing in Aurora 1.5 where PlayStation Summerfest is going on right now looks like it's thinned out a little bit there was a lot more people in there during Bobby's show but you know it's getting late on the East Coast some people got to go to bed sometimes

621
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

622
00:40:14,356 --> 00:40:15,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some gaming news.

623
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:17,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're just on the other side of the camera.

624
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:18,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, was the camera just facing that way?

625
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, someone made a Chibi Garrus plushie.

626
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I see, from back here, I see a Junebug.

627
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:28,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Says, thank you everyone very much.

628
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:30,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome job, VOG.

629
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:31,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Junebug.

630
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,854
[SPEAKER_09]: She won a $20 gift card during Bobby Blackwolf's show tonight for PlayStation Network, and she called in.

631
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:37,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was amazing.

632
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:38,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out, Junebug.

633
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:39,776
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

634
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:44,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, starting us off tonight with exclusive news, maybe?

635
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:45,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

636
00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:49,860
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I don't have all the details on this yet, but it was interesting.

637
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,081
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a test that they're doing.

638
00:40:51,541 --> 00:41:04,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, that new Nike Plus Fitness game for Kinect that's coming out this fall is going to require a subscription service in order to play the game.

639
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:10,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm not sure exactly how that works in... Because I was asking him some questions.

640
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:14,297
[SPEAKER_06]: He was basically... The rep we had at Microsoft was kind of using this.

641
00:41:14,337 --> 00:41:16,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we can sell some more points cards using this.

642
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:17,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like...

643
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:24,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Are people going to be kind of pissed off that you guys are charging 400 Microsoft points a month for the service?

644
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:26,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it's for stat tracking and something like that.

645
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:35,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, he said, because I don't know too much about this game, he said that the game will not work unless you pay this monthly fee.

646
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:39,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure what exactly is entailed there.

647
00:41:39,694 --> 00:41:42,635
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's just going to not track your progress...

648
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:52,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the monthly fee's for, or if it's just gonna plain, straight up not work unless you have, like, a pass or something to this.

649
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,461
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't pay us, you will get fat.

650
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:58,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't know.

651
00:41:58,463 --> 00:42:01,565
[SPEAKER_06]: See, my thought is, you know, I was just kind of...

652
00:42:02,945 --> 00:42:05,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you guys doing this?

653
00:42:05,146 --> 00:42:08,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, aren't people going to look at this kind of negative?

654
00:42:08,127 --> 00:42:09,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I even brought up the typical things.

655
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that you called them out on it.

656
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:15,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys, you have your gold service that people are paying for.

657
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you guys kind of worried that this might look bad since they're charging a fee on top of this?

658
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:25,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said it's just a test right now.

659
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:27,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

660
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:29,634
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a test.

661
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:30,814
[SPEAKER_09]: This is only a test.

662
00:42:32,555 --> 00:42:35,176
[SPEAKER_09]: That's me sucking money out of your wallet.

663
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:47,462
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to see what exactly this is when it comes out because I'm sure that he didn't have all the details because trust me, I know reps for companies that don't know what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to product.

664
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:53,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very possible that he got some stuff wrong or just wasn't clear on things.

665
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:58,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's just this whole stat tracking thing that's extra or something.

666
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:07,422
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still don't like the fact that a game is requiring you for a monthly fee for something that should be, in my opinion, included with it.

667
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:11,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we will see when this comes out.

668
00:43:11,741 --> 00:43:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it does require this, I mean, that kind of sucks for them because there's plenty of fitness games out there for the Xbox 360.

669
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, this has to be something, like, super special.

670
00:43:21,273 --> 00:43:26,820
[SPEAKER_09]: But then the Nike Plus has that whole, like, will it integrate with the shoes?

671
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

672
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:27,841
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

673
00:43:50,638 --> 00:43:53,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that'll have to be like right there on the front of the box.

674
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That they're going to be charging that.

675
00:43:56,403 --> 00:43:56,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be.

676
00:43:56,903 --> 00:43:57,804
[SPEAKER_09]: That's scary.

677
00:43:57,944 --> 00:43:59,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, then what are you getting?

678
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:03,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I can see if there's like a premium club or something.

679
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:07,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess that's no different from what Call of Duty... I'm guessing that's what it's going to be maybe.

680
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:12,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It's some sort of like, you know, if you subscribe to this, you'll get more out of it or something.

681
00:44:12,855 --> 00:44:15,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that would make sense to me.

682
00:44:15,217 --> 00:44:15,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I would...

683
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:37,302
[SPEAKER_06]: it would be a huge mistake to say okay this game requires all this DLC but that's how he phrased it like I said you know maybe it's just him misinterpreting you know the information that he's been given it's possible but I just am reporting what I've been told so 400 Microsoft points a month

684
00:44:38,182 --> 00:44:41,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people have mixed success rates with those fitness games.

685
00:44:41,725 --> 00:44:59,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Brad is talking to me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com right now, and he says, talking about fitness games, Christina got a Your Shape game, and while doing one of the initial setup scans, it told her, straighten your back, and they cracked up because she has scoliosis.

686
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:02,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So her response was, good luck with that.

687
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh dear, Marissa.

688
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:13,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I can imagine Marissa playing the Your Shape game.

689
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:15,110
[SPEAKER_09]: You seem a little top heavy.

690
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:18,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't straighten my back either.

691
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Put down your groceries.

692
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:24,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop carrying that baby.

693
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:25,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Please put down the watermelons.

694
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:31,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do Ooch's brassieres later.

695
00:45:32,949 --> 00:45:33,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

696
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else on this topic?

697
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, can I move on?

698
00:45:39,093 --> 00:45:42,716
[SPEAKER_06]: One more thing I forgot to mention this week on my gaming week.

699
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:43,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Dead or Alive 5.

700
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:45,918
[SPEAKER_06]: The near final build of that.

701
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:46,899
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

702
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,302
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't play Dead or Alive so it was button mash fest.

703
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:57,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do very well at that until I switched to Ryu and then I fucking kicked ass because he apparently is pretty conducive for button mashing.

704
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:00,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty, though.

705
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:01,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Dead or Alive?

706
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:04,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I made a huge faux pas, by the way.

707
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:06,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Christina's a girlfriend, not a wife.

708
00:46:06,336 --> 00:46:06,716
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

709
00:46:08,618 --> 00:46:09,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Awkward!

710
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

711
00:46:15,165 --> 00:46:15,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Back and away.

712
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I mention what a great show PodCulture is?

713
00:46:21,972 --> 00:46:28,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And you should all listen to it so that I can be forgiven Monday nights at 6 o'clock.

714
00:46:31,499 --> 00:46:34,561
[SPEAKER_04]: He offered time at the dinner table.

715
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:39,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob is rad now.

716
00:46:40,706 --> 00:46:41,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.

717
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:43,508
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like when people say, so Alan's your roommate?

718
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:48,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, we do live together.

719
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,740
[SPEAKER_03]: In the same room.

720
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:55,762
[SPEAKER_03]: And have mating practices.

721
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:57,522
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

722
00:46:57,842 --> 00:46:59,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, let's move on to Windows 8.

723
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, it's going to turn into the Giggle Show.

724
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:05,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop.

725
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:06,204
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

726
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,565
[SPEAKER_02]: She's over there making like she's digging a hole.

727
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:15,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about someone who's almost as awesome as Brad from PodCulture, Gabe Newell.

728
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:18,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's talking about Windows 8.

729
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:20,834
[SPEAKER_09]: He's not a fan.

730
00:47:21,234 --> 00:47:23,095
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Windows 8 is coming out towards the end of the year.

731
00:47:23,175 --> 00:47:28,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's been officially dated for October 26th.

732
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:31,937
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be coming out, and a lot of people are excited about Windows 8.

733
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:34,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of them that's not excited about Windows 8, Gabe Newell.

734
00:47:35,998 --> 00:47:37,940
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, quote, a catastrophe.

735
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,282
[SPEAKER_09]: He just straight up called it a catastrophe and that's according to AllThingsD.

736
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:45,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space.

737
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:49,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we'll lose some of the top tier PC OEMs who will exit the market.

738
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:51,349
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

739
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:16,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty big risk in a way.

740
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:18,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm sure the Linux folks are happy.

741
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy that all of a sudden old versions of Windows will just disappear and become Windows 8.

742
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:30,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a little interesting, but... I mean, gee, what's going to happen to all those computers running those older OSs and people not upgrading?

743
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:32,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I guess everything will work as usual.

744
00:48:33,435 --> 00:48:34,476
[SPEAKER_06]: That's odd.

745
00:48:35,116 --> 00:48:35,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

746
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:37,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard

747
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard is on board with this.

748
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:13,978
[SPEAKER_09]: It was according to Twitter and a comment from game designer Rob Pardo.

749
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:17,121
[SPEAKER_09]: He said on Twitter, Nice interview with Gabe Newell.

750
00:49:17,401 --> 00:49:20,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space.

751
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Not awesome for Blizzard either.

752
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:27,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Now keep in mind, this is one guy at Blizzard, but when he is a game designer...

753
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:32,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so there you go.

754
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Not some good early feedback.

755
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:38,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping this isn't going to go over like Windows ME or something or Windows Vista.

756
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:39,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, right?

757
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:44,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Even Marista, the non-gamer, is sitting over there going, oh, so cold, so cold.

758
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, give Marista the mic a minute.

759
00:49:47,311 --> 00:49:48,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Marista, you were not a fan of Windows ME?

760
00:49:48,773 --> 00:49:48,813
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

761
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,712
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've actually had it in many offices.

762
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:57,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been a legal secretary at many points in my life, and attorneys are very cheap.

763
00:49:57,775 --> 00:49:59,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had to try to work with Windows MA.

764
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:02,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have nightmares.

765
00:50:05,189 --> 00:50:08,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let me go back to the Gabe Newell thing a minute.

766
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:12,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Jamie, listen up, because I know this is software that is a big part of what you do.

767
00:50:13,517 --> 00:50:18,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Gabe Newell kind of alluded to programs like Adobe Photoshop.

768
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,593
[SPEAKER_09]: That causes us to have conversations with Adobe.

769
00:50:22,973 --> 00:50:28,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And we say the next version of Photoshop should look like a free to play game.

770
00:50:28,698 --> 00:50:34,443
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say, we have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, but it sounds really bad.

771
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:36,866
[SPEAKER_09]: And what he means by that is that he's saying, you know,

772
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:43,452
[SPEAKER_09]: People make money on things like Team Fortress 2 that are free to play.

773
00:50:43,973 --> 00:50:49,038
[SPEAKER_09]: One Steam user apparently making $150,000 a year selling hats in Team Fortress 2.

774
00:50:49,438 --> 00:50:55,284
[SPEAKER_09]: So he sort of goes to something like Adobe Photoshop and says, what if your platform was free

775
00:50:55,945 --> 00:50:56,746
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

776
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I could use GIMP.

777
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:21,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I love GIMP too, but I want what Photoshop does, so I use Photoshop.

778
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:25,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't there a lot, I mean, let's have real talk for a minute.

779
00:51:26,162 --> 00:51:28,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't there a lot of people that just pirate Photoshop?

780
00:51:28,683 --> 00:51:33,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, isn't that what Newell's kind of trying to get at?

781
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:34,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

782
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:41,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, people are pirating it anyway, so why don't you just make it free for everybody and then add the features?

783
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:43,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's not going to work.

784
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:50,418
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of companies that are still going to buy the official ones for their designers at a design firm.

785
00:51:50,939 --> 00:52:00,525
[SPEAKER_03]: There are plenty of professionals who are going to have licensed copies because they can't produce work for a profit situation if they are using a pirated version.

786
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:18,342
[SPEAKER_09]: they have to have licensing even free to play stuff sometimes has that pay tier you know like a lot of MMOs like you know Star Trek Online or DC Universe or whatever yeah it's free but then if you pay the monthly fee you get your you know uber access or whatever yeah Marissa let's give yeah

787
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:24,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be happy to pay if it was a little more reasonable for those of us who aren't using it under a professional capacity.

788
00:52:25,747 --> 00:52:28,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's what surprised me about Windows 8 is the price.

789
00:52:28,588 --> 00:52:36,489
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people are shocked about Windows 8 price, but some people infer that that's coming from the Mac side of things where I think the latest Mac upgrade was, what, $20, $30?

790
00:52:38,069 --> 00:52:40,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't quote me on that because I don't have a Mac to upgrade right now.

791
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,211
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, a lot of people are saying that Windows 8 is a cheap upgrade because of that.

792
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:49,617
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an interesting counter move.

793
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:49,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I like 7.

794
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:52,959
[SPEAKER_03]: 7 does what it needs to do.

795
00:52:53,560 --> 00:53:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the whole reason why more and more people are leaving the PC and Mac universe to head over to Linux because they want to have the control over what they install in their systems.

796
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:13,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Linux because if I want my system to be optimized for graphics over, say, sound...

797
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:17,718
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have to do is install a new kernel that's optimized for graphics.

798
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:18,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

799
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Or optimized for system speed.

800
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:21,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

801
00:53:22,482 --> 00:53:24,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I can switch between the two if I want to.

802
00:53:26,604 --> 00:53:28,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I have all of my programs.

803
00:53:28,185 --> 00:53:32,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I can download them through one place, yes, but they've been tested and work for my system.

804
00:53:33,309 --> 00:53:36,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still go through other means to download the programs that I want.

805
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:44,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running Linux Mint right now on my netbook, which was half the size of the Windows install that came on it.

806
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:50,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And it uses, I think, a third of the memory resources that Windows does.

807
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:53,310
[SPEAKER_09]: But is it efficient for porn?

808
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:55,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can watch porn on it, Rob.

809
00:53:55,939 --> 00:53:57,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything's efficient for porn.

810
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, Pornobox!

811
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:00,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you, Linux!

812
00:54:00,982 --> 00:54:03,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just gotten done looking up a bunch of Mass Effect porn.

813
00:54:03,964 --> 00:54:07,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean... You mean DeviantArt.

814
00:54:07,746 --> 00:54:08,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

815
00:54:10,806 --> 00:54:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I'm, I'm, I'm doing work.

816
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:15,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura.

817
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:21,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Any computer, if a computer from back in the 90s is efficient enough for porn, which mine was.

818
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: They're slow, let's be real.

819
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:25,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a netbook can easily look up porn.

820
00:54:25,234 --> 00:54:29,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Loki, I know you were the kid like me who dialed into all the BBSs.

821
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:30,638
[SPEAKER_06]: To download porn?

822
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:31,278
[SPEAKER_06]: To download porn!

823
00:54:31,298 --> 00:54:31,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It took time!

824
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:34,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That was dedication, because if that picture...

825
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:36,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were thankful Animated GIFs That's right

826
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:01,206
[SPEAKER_06]: and you what?

827
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:01,847
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

828
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:07,770
[SPEAKER_06]: You were lucky if it was in 256 colors because You look at those boobies in 16 colors and you'll like it.

829
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:30,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Go find an old Abandonware archive somewhere and download an old school strip poker game from like 1984 for what was called, now kids, I know you might not have heard of this, but for what's called a CGA monitor.

830
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody know what a CGA monitor does?

831
00:55:34,393 --> 00:55:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had EGA.

832
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:36,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

833
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:38,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a dirty porn story.

834
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:40,959
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite!

835
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:44,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Safe for your audience though, but it's funny that you mention that.

836
00:55:45,202 --> 00:55:52,607
[SPEAKER_04]: With the internet and internet pornography, it's amazing actually how much of a backlog and things that were on VHS that are on the internet.

837
00:55:53,287 --> 00:56:00,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I found out that a friend of mine, a gentleman, had done porn.

838
00:56:01,193 --> 00:56:02,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there for this.

839
00:56:03,014 --> 00:56:03,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you live in L.A.,

840
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:07,621
[SPEAKER_09]: She found out while she was here.

841
00:56:08,441 --> 00:56:10,042
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii came out.

842
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:16,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I understand why when we were doing the whole cute little find out your porn star name game.

843
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:19,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I understand why he thought that game was so funny.

844
00:56:20,489 --> 00:56:21,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I understand.

845
00:56:23,391 --> 00:56:27,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I managed to look it up and I found it.

846
00:56:27,194 --> 00:56:28,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 94.

847
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:30,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I also found out that he hadn't changed his comforter.

848
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:35,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I had house sat for him once and I was grossed out because they shot it at his house.

849
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you run and take a shower immediately?

850
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:37,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

851
00:56:38,281 --> 00:56:40,462
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a chair.

852
00:56:40,502 --> 00:56:42,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the same comfort.

853
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:43,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I slept in the bed.

854
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:47,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching his house and I took a screenshot of his own face and I sent it to all his friends.

855
00:56:48,626 --> 00:56:49,106
Wow!

856
00:56:50,527 --> 00:56:52,708
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a cunty thing to do!

857
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:53,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

858
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:55,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry if that word offends you.

859
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:55,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

860
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to go there.

861
00:56:58,231 --> 00:57:01,293
[SPEAKER_09]: That is like drag queen level see you next Tuesday.

862
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:02,694
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the truth.

863
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:06,898
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem was, Rob... You sent a picture of his O-face to all of his friends.

864
00:57:06,918 --> 00:57:07,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the problem.

865
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:09,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I had dated him.

866
00:57:10,781 --> 00:57:12,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did not tell me.

867
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:20,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I didn't want to have to make that confession, but yes, I have fucked a porn star.

868
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,194
Congratulations.

869
00:57:24,214 --> 00:57:24,495
Yay!

870
00:57:24,997 --> 00:57:27,399
[SPEAKER_09]: The things we learned on Orange Lounge Radio.

871
00:57:27,479 --> 00:57:28,540
[SPEAKER_04]: The more you know.

872
00:57:28,801 --> 00:57:32,124
[SPEAKER_04]: In retrospect, his technique makes a lot more sense now.

873
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:43,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I look back and... By technique meaning that he used the same techniques that butchers use for tenderizing meats?

874
00:57:45,236 --> 00:57:49,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Or perhaps that you're like, man, were you like a butter churner in your past life or something?

875
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

876
00:57:52,281 --> 00:57:58,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to give another hello to the PlayStation homers joining us for the first time at the Voice of Geeks Network.

877
00:57:58,264 --> 00:57:59,744
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the things geeks have to say.

878
00:57:59,804 --> 00:58:00,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knew?

879
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:01,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what?

880
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:08,268
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a comment coming from PlayStation Home from MandaPanda1979 Snow White banging the seven dwarves hot.

881
00:58:09,388 --> 00:58:13,070
[SPEAKER_09]: It really wasn't that hot, but yet we were 13 and loved it.

882
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:19,092
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the days of the pornos he was in was called Country Western Cuties Nude Pie Eating Contest.

883
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob is on the floor, literally.

884
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:29,864
[SPEAKER_04]: He was actually a country singer-songwriter.

885
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:30,904
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I knew him.

886
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:35,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, for the record, I had just broken up with my boyfriend.

887
00:58:36,348 --> 00:58:37,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very dark time for me.

888
00:58:40,202 --> 00:58:41,564
[SPEAKER_03]: So how about video games?

889
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:43,446
[SPEAKER_04]: That email actually sent them all.

890
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:46,231
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends had said, I have a present for you.

891
00:58:46,932 --> 00:58:51,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had the screen cap of his own face and in porny font it said, you're welcome.

892
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pie-eating gun.

893
00:58:55,924 --> 00:58:56,725
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry!

894
00:58:57,485 --> 00:59:05,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, and by the way, I actually had asked a bunch of my friends to tune in this evening who are not aware of this story.

895
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:09,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they know a lot more about me than I'd ever cared to have them know.

896
00:59:09,733 --> 00:59:17,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised that that's the title of it because that's actually, that's pretty, you know, it's not bad for a porn title.

897
00:59:17,478 --> 00:59:17,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's...

898
00:59:20,535 --> 00:59:24,596
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're talking like actual pies and not like pies in the pornographic sense.

899
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:26,396
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my mind went.

900
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:31,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been literally rolling on the floor laughing so hard.

901
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:33,117
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

902
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:36,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to take this moment to apologize.

903
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get to the games, please?

904
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:41,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

905
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:46,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Chiggers says that I'm going all Anderson Cooper right now.

906
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:49,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob was literally on the floor.

907
00:59:49,602 --> 00:59:54,526
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny is I had some people come up to you during the game summit thing that we had at our work and everything.

908
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:59,050
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, hey, so I have some libraries and stuff that might be interesting in your podcast.

909
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, you do realize this is a pretty adult podcast.

910
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we use some colorful languages and stuff.

911
01:00:03,373 --> 01:00:04,394
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, yeah, that's okay.

912
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:08,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, are you sure you know what you're getting into?

913
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:10,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if Catcher in the Rye is at the library, I mean.

914
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:11,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, you know.

915
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:12,361
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

916
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:13,181
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not my customers.

917
01:00:13,201 --> 01:00:13,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

918
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:24,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm so glad this is the OLR live I get to come back to after so much time away.

919
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't put this on the wiki.

920
01:00:27,943 --> 01:00:30,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow Windows 8 led to that discussion.

921
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:40,414
[SPEAKER_09]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Olive.

922
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:46,882
[SPEAKER_09]: So DarkSakura, why don't you try to bring us back to games here with another story?

923
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:47,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.

924
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:48,644
[SPEAKER_09]: More porn, please.

925
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:49,585
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, not that.

926
01:00:51,966 --> 01:01:01,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Square is saying that Versus 13 is going to still be out and they still are not showing shit about it.

927
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:04,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are watching porn!

928
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:04,530
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

929
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:14,433
[SPEAKER_03]: There was basically a statement by Yoichi Wada saying that someone was spreading a rumor about Versus being cancelled.

930
01:01:15,534 --> 01:01:28,884
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that he just left a regularly scheduled meeting for Versus and quote says, if you were to see the city, et cetera, presented today, you wouldn't be able to stand from surprise.

931
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Because everybody thinks the game is dead.

932
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:32,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

933
01:01:33,187 --> 01:01:42,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Could it be though, I mean, okay, so it's not canceled, but weren't there a lot of, you know, kind of rumor, I mean, granted, this is all rumors or whatever, that it could be a different name now?

934
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:44,440
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

935
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:47,562
[SPEAKER_03]: They just said that they're still running it under the luminous engine.

936
01:01:48,362 --> 01:01:48,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know.

937
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:49,443
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of what we talked about.

938
01:01:49,463 --> 01:01:54,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when this story came up last week, you weren't here, but we hypothesized that it could be 15.

939
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:55,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say anything about it.

940
01:01:55,527 --> 01:01:58,209
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be Final Fantasy XIII, a sequel reborn.

941
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:01,470
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what you did there.

942
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:02,570
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll come back to that.

943
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:07,251
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what do you think of Final Fantasy XIII Versus?

944
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:13,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Given that I didn't play the first XIII more than the level, then I kind of am not interested in it.

945
01:02:13,412 --> 01:02:16,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, keep in mind, Versus is more Kingdom Hearts-ish in the way it plays.

946
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I play Kingdom Hearts.

947
01:02:18,993 --> 01:02:22,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, I'm kind of spent on the Final Fantasy franchise.

948
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:24,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of don't care about it anymore.

949
01:02:25,515 --> 01:02:27,695
[SPEAKER_09]: XIV didn't help, but we'll get back to that later.

950
01:02:28,334 --> 01:02:28,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play 12.

951
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:35,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play 13 and I thought it wasn't great and I'm really not invested in the universe.

952
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:35,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

953
01:02:37,077 --> 01:03:01,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I think honestly between 13 and 13 verses it's pretty much just like Joel Schumacher Batman and you know a different Batman Final Fantasy 14 was kind of the Batman and Robin of the series right now it's kind of like we had to hire who's like a big we had to hire Steven Spielberg to redo Batman and Robin like that's what's going on in Final Fantasy 14 right now

954
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:08,182
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's move on with some more news while I get a drink of water because my face still hurts from laughing so hard.

955
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:09,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you, Marissa.

956
01:03:09,543 --> 01:03:12,485
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why you haven't been on this show because you kill me every time.

957
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:16,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to take... I'm on the Facebook app right now.

958
01:03:17,128 --> 01:03:21,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to take down the link I'd sent to all my friends inviting them to listen in.

959
01:03:25,032 --> 01:03:25,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm turning to the pod.

960
01:03:26,233 --> 01:03:27,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all of them knew that.

961
01:03:28,254 --> 01:03:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay, though.

962
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It is funny.

963
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you so much right now, I can't even.

964
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:35,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so what was his porn star name?

965
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:36,956
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

966
01:03:38,137 --> 01:03:42,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's gonna Google it now.

967
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:43,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

968
01:03:43,421 --> 01:03:46,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Games, video games, gaming culture, that's what we do here at OLR.

969
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:49,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you later.

970
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:51,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about Ouya.

971
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:56,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouya is that wonderful $99 console that's being kickstarted.

972
01:03:56,753 --> 01:04:04,478
[SPEAKER_06]: They made some announcements including that the streaming service OnLive will be coming to the system as well.

973
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:23,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big surprise since OnLive runs on Android and it's an Android device so it makes sense to me that it would be on there but of course OnLive has committed that they will deliver a full console class experience and bring hundreds of top tier games from more than 80 publishers more marketing speak marketing speak marketing speak

974
01:04:24,749 --> 01:04:46,240
[SPEAKER_06]: and then of course at the same time they also showed the second half of that concept picture for the Ouya controller and yeah it looks like the second half of the controller what do you expect and of course everyone's like oh I don't like that d-pad well everything's still not finalized it's just a concept picture but now you have your second half and wow it's looks like what you thought it would look like

975
01:04:50,021 --> 01:05:10,046
[SPEAKER_09]: The Ouya, the on-live thing is a really interesting backdoor to get the big games on Ouya because you remember a couple weeks ago we were kind of having our skepticism chat about should we fund this or not and we were talking about how they're doing this poll to see what games people want on Ouya and it's all this first-party stuff is what people really want.

976
01:05:10,127 --> 01:05:14,788
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, dude, this box is not going to be powerful enough to run Mass Effect 3 or something like that.

977
01:05:15,288 --> 01:05:22,810
[SPEAKER_09]: But, thanks to on-live technology, you could play Assassin's Creed or whatever the games are that are on OUYA.

978
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:25,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Borderlands is one of them, I know that.

979
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:32,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't believe a publisher can say, no, we don't want our game pushed to such and such.

980
01:05:33,372 --> 01:05:34,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think, yeah.

981
01:05:34,352 --> 01:05:39,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so that is, I gotta say, that's a really smart partnership.

982
01:05:40,393 --> 01:05:50,872
[SPEAKER_09]: because you're using a technology that your system can accommodate to kind of use those big games.

983
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's a really brilliant idea on their part.

984
01:05:53,874 --> 01:05:54,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

985
01:05:55,295 --> 01:06:01,662
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, I think we may have mentioned this last week that they're getting the prequel to The Human Element.

986
01:06:01,782 --> 01:06:03,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be an exclusive thing on there.

987
01:06:03,503 --> 01:06:03,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

988
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:05,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Considering that that game doesn't come out until 2015.

989
01:06:06,026 --> 01:06:10,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know... Why would you even announce a game that's going to come out that far from now?

990
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:10,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

991
01:06:14,212 --> 01:06:16,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool, you got a game coming out in 2015.

992
01:06:16,594 --> 01:06:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't remember by the time we get to 2015.

993
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:28,221
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, who earlier told me they were feeling ignored because of all the attention I'm giving to PlayStation Home tonight.

994
01:06:28,702 --> 01:06:32,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I love you guys too, at the regular chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

995
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:38,248
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw says, on live is on Android, so it coming to OUYA was a no-brainer.

996
01:06:38,628 --> 01:06:43,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you had said that last week, TigerClaw, you would have really looked like a games analyst, but now...

997
01:06:45,553 --> 01:06:52,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm not surprised, because even if it wasn't on there, they could have easily just sideloaded it on there.

998
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:59,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And GameGuru reminds us, OnLive already has a set-top box, you know, so it's already available out there.

999
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:02,580
[SPEAKER_06]: True, I think their set-top box is like $50 too.

1000
01:07:03,241 --> 01:07:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least this you'll get a set-top box that'll do that and other things.

1001
01:07:09,587 --> 01:07:12,089
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be cool if it was compatible with the on-live controllers.

1002
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:19,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that it's going to be compatible with any Bluetooth controller because then I can use my PS3 controller, which isn't getting a whole ton of use right now.

1003
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:25,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for browsing porn on the PS3.

1004
01:07:27,304 --> 01:07:28,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Fizz Liz Giggle Time

1005
01:07:55,544 --> 01:07:59,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently now it's the Running Man and Giggle Fitz in PlayStation Home.

1006
01:07:59,306 --> 01:07:59,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Summerfest.

1007
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:03,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1008
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:06,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think the Carlton's one of the dances.

1009
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:07,291
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be.

1010
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:10,152
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's great?

1011
01:08:10,613 --> 01:08:11,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Tangent time.

1012
01:08:11,393 --> 01:08:12,874
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready for a random Rob tangent?

1013
01:08:13,925 --> 01:08:16,707
[SPEAKER_09]: They upgraded the Lotus Notes system at my work.

1014
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:21,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, my work is one of the few that uses Lotus Notes as opposed to Outlooks, the other one, right?

1015
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:22,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So we use Lotus Notes.

1016
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the huge new features is customizable emote icons.

1017
01:08:28,695 --> 01:08:32,137
[SPEAKER_09]: So now when you do the instant message, you can have your own emote icons.

1018
01:08:32,537 --> 01:08:41,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the most popular ones right now that has been passed around at the workplace that we send to each other is the Carlton GIF when something goes well.

1019
01:08:44,206 --> 01:08:47,473
[SPEAKER_09]: You can add any animated gif to the emoticon system, which is amazing.

1020
01:08:47,493 --> 01:08:50,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Please tell me that you've added the table flipping or something.

1021
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:53,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a table flipping, but I have a cat jumping out a window.

1022
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:57,273
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks... It's a safe cat.

1023
01:08:57,313 --> 01:08:57,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry.

1024
01:08:57,614 --> 01:08:59,435
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a great distance, but it's not.

1025
01:08:59,455 --> 01:09:01,156
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like jumping into the backyard or something.

1026
01:09:01,636 --> 01:09:02,496
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's funny.

1027
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:03,377
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1028
01:09:03,697 --> 01:09:04,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1029
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:13,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Some things coming to... I feel bad that on the Sony PlayStation Home Night we have all this Microsoft news, but we do have some Sony news coming up a little later.

1030
01:09:14,303 --> 01:09:18,105
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is an interesting experience on the Xbox 360.

1031
01:09:18,145 --> 01:09:19,786
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some new TV...

1032
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:23,409
[SPEAKER_09]: TV Experiences coming later this year.

1033
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:36,201
[SPEAKER_09]: They are Connect Sesame Street TV, not to be confused with the game that already came out, and Connect National Geographic TV, which I think they're just calling Nat Geo, because I guess that's what the hip kids call it.

1034
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:37,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Nat Geo.

1035
01:09:38,483 --> 01:09:38,763
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1036
01:09:39,504 --> 01:09:42,667
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be $29.99, that's 2,400 Microsoft points, for eight 30-minute episodes.

1037
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:42,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1038
01:09:48,172 --> 01:09:51,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently they are interactive TV shows, though.

1039
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:56,894
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be available at retail and Xbox Live under the season pass.

1040
01:09:57,494 --> 01:10:02,855
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how the interactive episode works, but I imagine maybe you'll like Sesame Street.

1041
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:05,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You interact with Kinect stuff.

1042
01:10:05,356 --> 01:10:07,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

1043
01:10:07,096 --> 01:10:12,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Elmo will tell you, hey, toss me my teddy bear, and you make the motion like you're tossing him a teddy bear.

1044
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:15,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't, it will still play on as well.

1045
01:10:15,718 --> 01:10:17,178
[SPEAKER_06]: It's optional.

1046
01:10:18,092 --> 01:10:21,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, if I had kids, that does sound pretty rad.

1047
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:22,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It does sound pretty rad.

1048
01:10:22,237 --> 01:10:23,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you thought about something like this for Josh?

1049
01:10:23,979 --> 01:10:25,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I've definitely thought about it.

1050
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:26,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I may pick it up.

1051
01:10:27,763 --> 01:10:29,626
[SPEAKER_06]: How does Nat Geo work?

1052
01:10:30,764 --> 01:10:34,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see the topless natives point.

1053
01:10:35,008 --> 01:10:37,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's animals, not topless natives.

1054
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:43,355
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like, hey, can you spot the giraffe or something like that?

1055
01:10:43,515 --> 01:10:45,737
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll be given a thing that you have to find.

1056
01:10:45,877 --> 01:10:46,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I found it right there!

1057
01:10:48,599 --> 01:10:49,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Trivia and stuff like that.

1058
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,483
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing, too, is those are also rentable.

1059
01:10:53,723 --> 01:10:54,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I was gonna get to that.

1060
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:58,466
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also buy the episodes individually for five bucks.

1061
01:10:58,786 --> 01:11:00,347
[SPEAKER_09]: That's 400 Microsoft points.

1062
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,569
[SPEAKER_09]: September 18th is when this all starts.

1063
01:11:02,589 --> 01:11:03,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the purchase then.

1064
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:06,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Renting them is 240 Microsoft points each.

1065
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:07,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1066
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be worth checking out.

1067
01:11:10,272 --> 01:11:14,236
[SPEAKER_09]: You should definitely put Josh to the test there and see if it happens.

1068
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to say if he'll... He probably won't know what to do.

1069
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:19,020
[SPEAKER_06]: He's still a little young.

1070
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:25,587
[SPEAKER_06]: If they tell him, hey, jump up and down, sing a song, he's just going to sit there and eat a cracker.

1071
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:29,891
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, no, I'm not going to do that.

1072
01:11:30,951 --> 01:11:36,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Skull King in PlayStation Home says, will this Sesame Street game be like Dora the Explorer?

1073
01:11:36,712 --> 01:11:37,873
[SPEAKER_09]: If so, I'm down.

1074
01:11:38,373 --> 01:11:43,074
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of how, yeah, that show works a little bit.

1075
01:11:44,094 --> 01:11:45,074
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's like for real.

1076
01:11:45,454 --> 01:11:48,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that'll be the next thing that comes to Kinect if these do well.

1077
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:49,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about how well these do.

1078
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:56,437
[SPEAKER_09]: But Sesame Street, as iconic as it is, I imagine it's got to be pretty cheap to produce.

1079
01:11:56,517 --> 01:11:57,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1080
01:11:58,317 --> 01:12:03,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Since this is all PBS programming Fuck Dora the Explorer, she's on Nickelodeon You know what it's all about?

1081
01:12:04,522 --> 01:12:09,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking Carmen Sandiego, that's right Ghostwriter on there?

1082
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:22,235
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no Reading Rainbow I want LeVar Burton to read to me on my Xbox 360 in that sexy, sexy voice

1083
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:27,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, PBS.

1084
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:29,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.

1085
01:12:29,722 --> 01:12:34,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I know Mr. Rogers is long gone, but maybe a live interaction with King Friday.

1086
01:12:34,908 --> 01:12:36,469
[SPEAKER_09]: And what was that lady's name?

1087
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:37,811
[SPEAKER_09]: She was kind of a bitch.

1088
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:41,775
[SPEAKER_09]: The lady that had the museum or something, the carousel.

1089
01:12:43,597 --> 01:12:44,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you lost me.

1090
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody with me here.

01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:50,863
[SPEAKER_13]: We were listening to the theme song yesterday.

1094
01:12:51,703 --> 01:12:59,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Two elephants went out to play upon a spider's web one day.

1095
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:05,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell is my goddamn Bob Ross painting game that I was promised at the launch of the Wii?

1096
01:13:06,189 --> 01:13:06,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell me you heard that new Bob Ross remix.

[SPEAKER_09]: Lady Jane?

01:13:20,694 --> 01:13:21,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee gives the full name.

01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:24,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady Elaine Fairchild.

1105
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:24,977
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it.

1106
01:13:25,397 --> 01:13:26,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady Fairchild.

1107
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:28,899
[SPEAKER_09]: She was kind of a bitch.

[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, damn it, that's like a song or something.

1111
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:02,341
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a creepy puppet is what that is.

1112
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:05,522
[SPEAKER_09]: It had a picture on it, but... Is she a creepy puppet?

1113
01:14:06,182 --> 01:14:07,242
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a creepy puppet!

1114
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:09,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, forget it.

1115
01:14:10,483 --> 01:14:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, maybe if that pop song's any good, I could put that in a VOG Network rotation.

1116
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more stories.

1117
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:16,984
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.

1118
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:23,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about a survival game called Pulse?

1119
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:24,806
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free!

1120
01:14:25,546 --> 01:14:27,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was put out by the Vancouver Film School.

1121
01:14:29,116 --> 01:14:30,057
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1122
01:14:57,435 --> 01:15:06,297
[SPEAKER_03]: and the sounds they make help her see the world around her kind of you know daredevil like so she has sonar she has sonar by throwing fairies into the wall

1123
01:15:08,398 --> 01:15:33,358
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's done by Pixel Pie team and it's very artsy, colorful, cartoony but it's very, very grim and actually they want to expand it beyond the free version but for now I think if you want to get it you can go to their official site which is teampixelpie as in 3.14 dot com

1124
01:15:37,426 --> 01:15:39,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get it when I get home.

1125
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:41,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad these students had time to produce this, you know.

1126
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:44,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And the site is really pretty.

1127
01:15:44,128 --> 01:15:45,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the color scheme in this.

1128
01:15:46,248 --> 01:15:48,509
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is just very different.

1129
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:51,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, congrats to the folks at Bear Cooper Films.

1130
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's another one, too.

1131
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:52,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

1132
01:15:53,410 --> 01:16:00,212
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one called The Mask of Ki, QI, which is a third-person platformer that has a masked flying squirrel.

1133
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:03,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's done by Team Kronk.

1134
01:16:03,573 --> 01:16:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's another freebie.

1135
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:13,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of some more traditional retail games coming to a store near you this week.

1136
01:16:13,582 --> 01:16:13,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki?

1137
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:24,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of big things, but the couple big games that you'll probably be interested in, starting off with Risen 2 Dark Waters on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and I believe PC.

1138
01:16:26,062 --> 01:16:35,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for 3DS owners, finally getting your copy of Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance in 3D on 3DS.

1139
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:36,464
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't say.

1140
01:16:37,204 --> 01:16:38,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do say.

1141
01:16:39,185 --> 01:16:39,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

1142
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:42,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's pretty much it.

1143
01:16:42,527 --> 01:16:43,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at least those are the big ones this week.

1144
01:16:43,988 --> 01:16:46,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Kingdom Hearts game is kind of a big deal, so that's cool.

1145
01:16:48,953 --> 01:16:50,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that'd be it.

1146
01:16:50,855 --> 01:16:51,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Growlancers.

1147
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:52,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1148
01:16:52,496 --> 01:16:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Growlancer way far over time.

1149
01:16:54,398 --> 01:16:55,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Forgot the Atlas PSP title.

1150
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,842
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving to Japan and checking out the release dates over there.

1151
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:04,065
[SPEAKER_09]: The Idolmaster 2 gets a price reduction this week on the Xbox 360.

1152
01:17:04,105 --> 01:17:08,888
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a new release, but if you like to save money, that will be going into effect this week.

1153
01:17:09,268 --> 01:17:17,034
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PlayStation 3, things are a little more exciting when you have Tales of Vesperia also getting a price reduction and Tales of Graces F.

1154
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:24,219
[SPEAKER_09]: also getting a price reduction and Troy Musu getting a price reduction as well as Idolmaster 2.

1155
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:25,460
[SPEAKER_09]: There's lots of price reductions.

1156
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:26,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Battlefield Bad Company 2.

1157
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:33,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a PlayStation 3 sale but sadly no new games to report on either of those systems this week in Japan.

1158
01:17:34,147 --> 01:17:43,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the PlayStation Vita, there is a game called Momo Daisensu Gendaiban comes out this week in a regular and premium edition.

1159
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,660
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a game on the Vita.

1160
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:50,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's based off an anime or what, but it's from System Soft, and it kind of looks like these...

1161
01:17:51,969 --> 01:17:55,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to randomly add that Chris always compliments your Japanese pronunciation.

1162
01:17:55,532 --> 01:17:56,653
[SPEAKER_09]: He's always impressed by it.

1163
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:58,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't listen to early episodes of the show because it was a hot mess.

1164
01:17:58,855 --> 01:17:59,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Never had a class.

1165
01:18:16,511 --> 01:18:20,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I did have Jamie sitting over here to slap me on the back of the head when I'd get one wrong.

1166
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:20,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do it right.

1167
01:18:20,954 --> 01:18:21,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Punch, punch, punch.

1168
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:23,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the emphasis on the wrong syllable.

1169
01:18:26,839 --> 01:18:33,764
[SPEAKER_09]: On the 3DS this week, more exciting games like Smile Precure, Let's Go, Marchin' World.

1170
01:18:35,285 --> 01:18:42,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Madagascar 3 and Wan Nyan Dobutsu Buyen 2 Sorry, that's not a Nyan cat game.

1171
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,893
[SPEAKER_09]: It just happens to have that in the name.

1172
01:18:43,913 --> 01:18:46,034
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is a cat and a dog in it.

1173
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:53,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought for a second there was like Wan Nyan Midnight Maximum Toon or something like that.

1174
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:58,706
[SPEAKER_06]: A crazy drift racing Nyan cat starring Toons as the driving cat.

1175
01:18:58,806 --> 01:18:59,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be awesome.

1176
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:28,853
[SPEAKER_09]: this actually looks super cute like it looks like a pet hospital kind of game because the front cover has all these you know this guy and ladies in like lab long white coats that you'd see veterinarians wear and it's all kitties and puppies and that guy in the back look oh my god this is perfect Shane if you're listening you need to see this dude in the back with blue hair holding a corgi that's like it's Shane it's Shane personified right there I'm gonna send him a link to this in case he's listening all right

1177
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:30,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1178
01:19:31,036 --> 01:19:32,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm busy calibrating.

1179
01:19:33,277 --> 01:19:34,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are you, Garrus?

1180
01:19:36,097 --> 01:19:37,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do UK releases.

1181
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:44,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, in the UK, I'm going to have to reload the page, but on the 30th, we have Orcs Must Die.

1182
01:19:45,419 --> 01:19:48,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I have to go back to the top of the page and load it next month.

1183
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:54,281
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they freaking changed how their things work, so whatever.

1184
01:19:56,102 --> 01:19:57,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where's fucking August?

1185
01:19:58,284 --> 01:19:58,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.

1186
01:19:59,324 --> 01:20:00,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, August.

1187
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:01,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help it!

1188
01:20:03,147 --> 01:20:03,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop judging me.

1189
01:20:04,288 --> 01:20:04,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1190
01:20:04,908 --> 01:20:07,330
[SPEAKER_03]: On August 1st, Deadlight and Puddle.

1191
01:20:08,211 --> 01:20:10,492
[SPEAKER_03]: On August 3rd, Risen 2, Dark Waters.

1192
01:20:10,752 --> 01:20:11,393
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's all.

1193
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:12,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's anything else, I don't care.

1194
01:20:15,876 --> 01:20:18,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, folks overseas, but DarkSakura doesn't care.

1195
01:20:18,965 --> 01:20:21,206
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's all that Eurogamer told me there was.

1196
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:22,147
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1197
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:23,388
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more news stories.

1198
01:20:23,468 --> 01:20:24,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't be bothered.

1199
01:20:25,349 --> 01:20:26,830
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple more news stories for you guys.

1200
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:28,911
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the classic game of the week.

1201
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a trip down memory lane and revisit a game from the past that you should check out because DarkSakura told you to.

1202
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:37,216
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, a couple more news stories.

1203
01:20:37,256 --> 01:20:39,217
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, because Dan told me to tell you to.

1204
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:40,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1205
01:20:40,768 --> 01:20:52,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so apparently GameStop CEO Paul Raines, he made a comment regarding the possibility of a used digital downloads format.

1206
01:20:53,014 --> 01:21:09,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, the whole lawsuit that happened in the UK kind of set an interest, well, it didn't really set a precedent, but it was interesting that they kind of favored towards that, that you should be able to get refunds for used games when you're done using them.

1207
01:21:10,062 --> 01:21:11,484
[SPEAKER_06]: and many more.

1208
01:21:32,502 --> 01:21:42,607
[SPEAKER_06]: and they kind of have a similar service on there where you can use GU to create PC licenses for different games.

1209
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:48,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say, no, we don't see a lot of interest in the model from our publishing partners.

1210
01:21:50,948 --> 01:21:54,891
[SPEAKER_06]: but definitely something that they're interested in looking at when that time comes.

1211
01:21:55,211 --> 01:22:02,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it makes sense if everything's going to go digital and stuff and they do eventually have a way to revoke licenses, which would be pretty cool.

1212
01:22:03,057 --> 01:22:06,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, especially some of the stuff I have on Steam and stuff.

1213
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:16,748
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could sell some of the things that I'm not playing and I got in some of these indie bundles, that would be kind of cool to trade it in for other things.

1214
01:22:18,169 --> 01:22:22,612
[SPEAKER_06]: But, of course, if it has anything to do with used game sales, they're probably all over it.

1215
01:22:23,512 --> 01:22:24,293
[SPEAKER_09]: You think this could work?

1216
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:29,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It could work, but it involves all the publishers having to agree on that kind of thing.

1217
01:22:29,857 --> 01:22:33,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of basically agreeing to having a used marketplace.

1218
01:22:33,539 --> 01:22:36,001
[SPEAKER_06]: And isn't that what they're kind of trying to get rid of already?

1219
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:36,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1220
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:40,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's... I don't think that this is ever going to...

1221
01:22:41,744 --> 01:22:57,713
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, hit full force anytime soon There's a part of me that thinks a system like this is just begging to be hacked Like, I kind of think they might try to implement Well, then again, I don't know Steam works alright Like, they haven't been able to hack Steam, right?

1222
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:09,979
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I don't know Something like this just seems like it's begging to be worked around There's ways to hack games Not that I'm saying you should do it But it definitely is one of the things that's got to be giving publishers pause

1223
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:14,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think a lot of these systems are going to be closed.

1224
01:23:15,649 --> 01:23:21,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing too is like say I have a PS3 game or something like that and I want to trade my digital copy in for something.

1225
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:23,912
[SPEAKER_06]: What if I want to get a 360 game with that?

1226
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:25,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I going to be able to do that?

1227
01:23:25,273 --> 01:23:27,353
[SPEAKER_06]: The system is going to be separate and you have different rules.

1228
01:23:27,473 --> 01:23:30,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean there's a whole lot of things going on there.

1229
01:23:30,795 --> 01:23:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just – that's probably why this isn't – they're trying to get rid of used game sales.

1230
01:23:35,696 --> 01:23:37,397
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to try to all of a sudden say –

1231
01:23:37,757 --> 01:23:40,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, yeah, we're gonna go digital, but we're bringing used games back.

1232
01:23:40,978 --> 01:23:42,099
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not gonna happen.

1233
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:46,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on, they're doing this to get people to buy new games in the first place.

1234
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:51,482
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to all of a sudden flip a 180 and just say, hey, by the way, used games are awesome.

1235
01:23:52,603 --> 01:23:53,423
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's not gonna happen.

1236
01:23:54,303 --> 01:23:59,986
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one more story for you guys here before the classic game of the week, and it has to do with Final Fantasy XIV.

1237
01:24:00,546 --> 01:24:06,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we do want to do a little reporting on Final Fantasy XIV because, you know, very interesting MMO.

1238
01:24:06,728 --> 01:24:10,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it wasn't that great when it came out.

1239
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:10,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be real.

1240
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:14,772
[SPEAKER_09]: If you played it on PC, especially when it first came out, it was a really crap game.

1241
01:24:15,532 --> 01:24:23,076
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been improvements since it first launched, and they're promising even more before the big launch on PlayStation 3 later this year.

1242
01:24:23,537 --> 01:24:29,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they now are officially calling it Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn.

1243
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:33,482
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the version 2.0 of the game that's going to be coming out later this year.

1244
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's coming out later this year.

1245
01:24:35,964 --> 01:24:36,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

1246
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:40,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a TBA 2013 date right now for it.

1247
01:24:40,925 --> 01:24:41,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1248
01:24:43,087 --> 01:24:44,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they did put out a trailer this week.

1249
01:24:44,888 --> 01:24:48,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even watched this trailer yet, but I'm told there's no gameplay in it.

1250
01:24:48,772 --> 01:24:49,853
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just CGI.

1251
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:50,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1252
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:52,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy trailer, no gameplay in it?

1253
01:24:52,275 --> 01:24:53,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

1254
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:53,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Color me shocked.

1255
01:24:54,036 --> 01:25:01,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, a lot of this has to do with, like, it's basically Final Fantasy XIV Cataclysm.

1256
01:25:02,782 --> 01:25:06,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look, you can see, and we're watching the trailer here, and you can probably hear a little bit of the audio coming through the feed.

1257
01:25:07,205 --> 01:25:12,528
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're looking at, you know, missiles flying from the sky and basically destroying things.

1258
01:25:12,588 --> 01:25:15,350
[SPEAKER_09]: You see all these, like, warriors suiting up and putting up shields.

1259
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,192
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's very obvious the world is being hit.

1260
01:25:18,612 --> 01:25:22,675
[SPEAKER_09]: So that tells me that's their, you know, just like they did in World of Warcraft, that's their way to...

1261
01:25:23,055 --> 01:25:49,835
[SPEAKER_09]: To change the look of the world and so forth But I gotta say, you know, CGI heavy or not, it looks great Of course the original trailer for XIV looked awesome I remember that original trailer at E3 gave me chills Just because I spent so many years with Final Fantasy XI I was like legit that excited And then when I played the game I had different type of chills So cold, so cold, it's so bad Why is this allowed to be released?

1262
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:51,216
[SPEAKER_13]: He touched me in a dirty place

1263
01:25:51,576 --> 01:25:53,218
[SPEAKER_09]: But see, that looks pretty rad, doesn't it?

1264
01:25:53,638 --> 01:25:55,360
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1265
01:25:55,380 --> 01:25:56,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just looking here at the end.

1266
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:58,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to see if there's actually a date.

1267
01:25:58,543 --> 01:25:59,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, coming soon.

1268
01:25:59,764 --> 01:26:00,445
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have a date.

1269
01:26:00,825 --> 01:26:02,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming soon to PlayStation 3 and PC.

1270
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:10,235
[SPEAKER_06]: December 31st, 2013 is what the placeholder date is right now, which means TBA 2013.

1271
01:26:10,295 --> 01:26:12,237
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's TBA 2012, then yeah, maybe later this year, but...

1272
01:26:13,078 --> 01:26:18,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Akuma JP says, Meteo, maybe that's a reference to what you might be seeing there in the trailer.

1273
01:26:18,864 --> 01:26:19,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting thought.

1274
01:26:19,905 --> 01:26:26,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Monty Boggs says, Final Fantasy, the new 52, in parentheses, online players via PlayStation 3.

1275
01:26:29,196 --> 01:26:30,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I see what you did there.

1276
01:26:30,897 --> 01:26:35,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, AkumaJP is putting it together saying there's a red meteor in the sky, so he thinks it's gonna involve Meteor.

1277
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:42,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, Final Fantasy XIV, at least the look of it fits in very well with the series.

1278
01:26:42,144 --> 01:26:45,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of, you know, a bummer the game was kind of crap.

1279
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:50,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XI, a game reborn into Final Fantasy Version 2.

1280
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:56,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, look, let's take a step back to a time when games are a lot more simple.

1281
01:26:58,393 --> 01:26:59,554
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1282
01:27:27,694 --> 01:27:28,274
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1283
01:27:49,688 --> 01:27:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: You can basically have as many vehicles as you want to complete the rally, but you have to have gas.

1284
01:27:57,313 --> 01:28:07,499
[SPEAKER_03]: In the arcade, the Sega, and the Lynx version, you could start the game at a higher rally and get more opportunities to jump levels.

1285
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:14,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can continue the game from where you left off, but you only have one chance to complete the 50th and final rally.

1286
01:28:15,604 --> 01:28:21,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have fuel, four ways that you can get in this game by green globes, red globes, a checkpoint, and the rally point.

1287
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:24,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Green globes are on the road and they fill your main tank.

1288
01:28:24,793 --> 01:28:28,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Red globes are getting by shooting enemies on the road.

1289
01:28:29,577 --> 01:28:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And after you complete the rally, you get an extra fuel reserve depending on how many enemies you destroy.

1290
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:40,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get fuel by blowing shit up.

1291
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:46,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Each consecutive kill shot increases your multiplier one up to ten, and a miss lowers your multiplier by one.

1292
01:28:46,812 --> 01:28:52,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever your multiplier is that when you cross the line, you get that much fuel.

1293
01:28:53,878 --> 01:28:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Excuse me, I just finished my coffee.

1294
01:28:58,042 --> 01:28:58,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, girl.

1295
01:28:59,263 --> 01:28:59,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1296
01:29:00,283 --> 01:29:00,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your coffee.

1297
01:29:03,146 --> 01:29:13,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you have a checkpoint, a midway point, where when you cross that line, you actually get the amount of fuel in the main tank restored to what it was at the beginning of the rally.

1298
01:29:15,051 --> 01:29:20,353
[SPEAKER_03]: But your reserve tank is not restored, so it's just basically like you get a quick fill-up.

1299
01:29:20,453 --> 01:29:20,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick fill-up.

1300
01:29:22,033 --> 01:29:23,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got different cars in there.

1301
01:29:23,254 --> 01:29:24,876
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the Stingers, which are orange.

1302
01:29:25,376 --> 01:29:26,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Command cars, which are purple.

1303
01:29:26,597 --> 01:29:30,980
[SPEAKER_03]: They have bulletproof bumpers and must be killed by a cruise missile or an electro shield.

1304
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,062
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Cycles, Rat Jeeps.

1305
01:29:33,102 --> 01:29:33,982
[SPEAKER_03]: They come in from the left.

1306
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop and swerve to the right.

1307
01:29:35,463 --> 01:29:36,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, they're like knights in chess.

1308
01:29:37,945 --> 01:29:44,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Gun turrets, you have mines on the road, you cannot destroy them, but you get alarms that let you know where they are.

1309
01:29:45,273 --> 01:29:46,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And toxic spells.

1310
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:49,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You get special weapons, you get the UZ Cannon.

1311
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:55,002
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rapid fire gun that does not deplete your multiplier, but they have limited ammo.

1312
01:29:55,363 --> 01:29:58,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a cruise missile, which kaboom, you get three missiles.

1313
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:04,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitro Inject, which increases your speed from 210 to 298 kilometers per hour.

1314
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:06,131
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this British game?

1315
01:30:07,172 --> 01:30:12,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Electro Shield, which lets you drive through the enemy unharmed for a short distance and you get three to a pack.

1316
01:30:14,297 --> 01:30:20,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they wanted, though, now this is a little bit of information about the production, which actually this little bit, I did not know.

1317
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:28,823
[SPEAKER_03]: The creators wanted to have an electronic version of Mr. Sandman to play on one of the levels, but they never put it in.

1318
01:30:30,684 --> 01:30:31,364
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of weird.

1319
01:30:31,825 --> 01:30:32,505
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that is weird.

1320
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:41,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it had a promo with the original arcade game where you could send in your score when all 50 levels are completed to get a free Road Blasters t-shirt.

1321
01:30:41,927 --> 01:30:50,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it had a toy tie-in by Matchbox so you get die-cast, um, cars that can be customized with armor, lasers, machine guns, rocket launchers, and jet engines.

1322
01:30:50,816 --> 01:30:53,339
[SPEAKER_03]: There were the Turbo Force and the Motor Lords.

1323
01:30:54,921 --> 01:30:58,966
[SPEAKER_03]: During the gameplay you get a slightly robotic sounding female voice that gives you advice.

1324
01:30:59,867 --> 01:31:05,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has different phrases including hit it and eat lead road hog.

1325
01:31:06,676 --> 01:31:10,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you use your nitro inject you get now that's cruising.

1326
01:31:12,363 --> 01:31:14,283
[SPEAKER_03]: A guy with a last name that I can't pronounce.

1327
01:31:14,363 --> 01:31:15,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing it's a Polish name.

1328
01:31:15,824 --> 01:31:25,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan Szczepanski holds the official Guinness World Record for Road Blaster.

1329
01:31:25,388 --> 01:31:26,688
[SPEAKER_03]: At 2,216,120 points.

1330
01:31:26,828 --> 01:31:29,009
[SPEAKER_03]: If you beat this, we'll give you some air.

1331
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:30,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1332
01:31:31,090 --> 01:31:31,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Road Blasters.

1333
01:31:32,817 --> 01:31:33,418
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1334
01:31:34,118 --> 01:31:35,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Good classic game of the week.

1335
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:40,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember many bowling alley trips to play Road Blasters, among other things.

1336
01:31:41,243 --> 01:31:42,124
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let me shut up.

1337
01:31:42,624 --> 01:31:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, be quiet, Road Blasters.

1338
01:31:43,705 --> 01:31:44,606
[SPEAKER_09]: We're done with you for now.

1339
01:31:45,226 --> 01:31:45,567
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1340
01:31:46,647 --> 01:31:47,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a quick break, guys.

1341
01:31:48,129 --> 01:31:48,709
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not done.

1342
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:51,191
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to take a little break to rest ourselves.

1343
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:52,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Bathroom break and what have you.

1344
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:54,373
[SPEAKER_09]: More coffee for DarkSakura.

1345
01:31:54,453 --> 01:31:54,954
[SPEAKER_09]: No, break.

1346
01:31:55,054 --> 01:31:56,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Or whatever she might need.

1347
01:31:56,815 --> 01:31:57,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Garrus Break.

1348
01:31:57,635 --> 01:32:08,660
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be back though in about six minutes with more, or if you're listening to us on the podcast, we'll be back in like six seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio and of course we got the Rapid Fire News.

1349
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:15,003
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got your phone calls, your tweets, your emails, and Lord knows what else from Marissa.

1350
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:22,546
[SPEAKER_09]: In just about six minutes here live at the VOG Network or the Voice of Geeks Network.

1351
01:32:23,387 --> 01:32:25,528
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1352
01:32:25,548 --> 01:32:26,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go anywhere.

1353
01:32:31,856 --> 01:32:36,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1354
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:44,084
[SPEAKER_09]: We are live here on July the 29th of 2012 with the 467th episode of our show already in progress.

1355
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:45,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Big night tonight.

1356
01:32:46,306 --> 01:32:49,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I was laughing so hard in part A that it hurts.

1357
01:32:49,368 --> 01:32:57,934
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have no idea what I'm talking about, I guess you'll have to tune into the podcast later, which Marissa will not be plugging on her Facebook, just for the record.

1358
01:32:57,954 --> 01:33:00,215
[SPEAKER_09]: But Marissa is in studio joining us tonight.

1359
01:33:01,656 --> 01:33:03,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Above all else, having a good time, I hope so.

1360
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:04,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1361
01:33:05,658 --> 01:33:14,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Not just Marissa having a good time with our show, but the folks participating in PlayStation Home Summerfest, the fan event going on right now.

1362
01:33:15,021 --> 01:33:22,304
[SPEAKER_09]: We are in the Aurora 1.5 space, but to make sure you're in the right instance, you do want to make sure you follow somebody there.

1363
01:33:22,444 --> 01:33:29,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Home Event Bot is no longer in there, if I was looking correctly earlier, but you could follow Black Wolf.

1364
01:33:29,687 --> 01:33:30,687
[SPEAKER_09]: He is in there right now.

1365
01:33:31,247 --> 01:33:36,471
[SPEAKER_09]: and so am I, GreenSky with IE at the end.

1366
01:33:36,631 --> 01:33:40,273
[SPEAKER_09]: You can follow either one of us into the appropriate event space there.

1367
01:33:40,293 --> 01:33:41,894
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Tigerclaw's in there as well.

1368
01:33:42,355 --> 01:33:46,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully you can follow a friend into PlayStation Home.

1369
01:33:46,517 --> 01:33:47,878
[SPEAKER_09]: It has thinned out a little bit.

1370
01:33:47,938 --> 01:33:51,461
[SPEAKER_09]: It is getting later and later on the East Coast and some people have some other things to do tonight.

1371
01:33:51,761 --> 01:33:55,783
[SPEAKER_09]: But to all you that are still there dancing and chatting along there...

1372
01:33:56,724 --> 01:34:12,149
[SPEAKER_09]: a big thank you to staying up late with us here at the Voice of Geeks Network and listening to Orange Lounge Radio Black Wolf is in VOG chat and he's in the PlayStation Home space right now saying they are bubbling me in home now I don't want to know what that means

1373
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:14,419
[SPEAKER_09]: We're bubbling somebody, isn't it?

1374
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:14,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1375
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it what the floor was doing?

1376
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,720
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the floor makes those pretty effects.

1377
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,180
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1378
01:34:19,701 --> 01:34:27,223
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'm being told to pick a number between 1 and 100 and say it on the air for another Blender giveaway.

1379
01:34:27,303 --> 01:34:29,424
[SPEAKER_09]: He was awesome enough to give something away during... R!

1380
01:34:31,805 --> 01:34:32,986
[SPEAKER_09]: The letter R will not work.

1381
01:34:33,386 --> 01:34:36,588
[SPEAKER_09]: He was awesome enough to give something away during the Bobby Blackwell show and he's giving something away now.

1382
01:34:36,948 --> 01:34:42,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows what it could be, but I will let the lovely Marissa, because she's here tonight, pick that number between 1 and 100.

1383
01:34:42,772 --> 01:34:43,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, what's it going to be?

1384
01:34:45,174 --> 01:34:43,593
3.

1385
01:34:46,134 --> 01:34:47,415
[SPEAKER_09]: 3!

1386
01:34:46,374 --> 01:34:47,415
[SPEAKER_09]: She's lowballing it.

1387
01:34:47,675 --> 01:34:48,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, 1 and 100.

1388
01:34:48,656 --> 01:34:54,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't make any references to balls with me after the first one.

1389
01:34:54,139 --> 01:34:55,000
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 balls, Marissa?

1390
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:55,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, 3 balls?

1391
01:34:58,843 --> 01:34:59,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1392
01:34:59,744 --> 01:35:00,024
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1393
01:35:00,104 --> 01:35:00,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Three it is.

1394
01:35:00,744 --> 01:35:01,585
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the magic number.

1395
01:35:01,725 --> 01:35:02,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

1396
01:35:02,626 --> 01:35:03,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope it's you.

1397
01:35:04,267 --> 01:35:04,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1398
01:35:05,127 --> 01:35:07,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what that's going to pick, but Blender will let us know.

1399
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:08,570
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1400
01:35:09,530 --> 01:35:16,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news and some quick news stories.

1401
01:35:16,555 --> 01:35:18,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the Fugo question of the week.

1402
01:35:18,116 --> 01:35:20,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll explain that for those that are new to the show.

1403

[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to once again welcome any new listeners we might have this week because of Summerfest or whatever.

01:37:47,984 --> 01:37:48,404
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1421
01:38:06,443 --> 01:38:13,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't talk about this during my gaming week because it's not really a game, but we finally went and saw Batman on Tuesday, and they played a trailer for that.

1422
01:38:13,649 --> 01:38:17,232
[SPEAKER_09]: They played a video game trailer before the movie, which I thought was interesting.

1423
01:38:18,273 --> 01:38:20,195
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how movie theaters do this now?

1424
01:38:20,235 --> 01:38:22,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure every movie theater in America does this now.

1425
01:38:22,277 --> 01:38:31,765
[SPEAKER_09]: You go to the movie, and before the trailers start, there's just the 20 minutes of basically commercials that they call, I don't know, what is it, First Look or The 20 or something, where it's just...

1426
01:38:32,506 --> 01:38:33,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just commercials.

1427
01:38:33,026 --> 01:38:34,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta get here to see our advertisements.

1428
01:38:34,706 --> 01:38:34,947
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1429
01:38:34,967 --> 01:38:36,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Get here early and see our ads.

1430
01:38:36,627 --> 01:38:38,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you consumer whore.

1431
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:42,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were showing a trailer for that Modern Warfare 2.

1432
01:38:43,588 --> 01:38:45,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And Alan leans over to me and goes, this looks bad.

1433
01:38:45,989 --> 01:38:46,469
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?

1434
01:38:46,509 --> 01:38:47,309
[SPEAKER_09]: This doesn't look good.

1435
01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:49,690
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, it's a shoot-em game, honey.

1436
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:50,310
[SPEAKER_09]: You wouldn't like it.

1437
01:38:50,350 --> 01:38:51,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great game.

1438
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,991
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't know what he's talking about.

1439
01:38:54,031 --> 01:39:00,312
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, the new one's actually being, you know, kind of ties in with Batman because it's being written by the guy that did... Yes, I was in the ads.

1440
01:39:00,452 --> 01:39:00,812
[SPEAKER_06]: And so...

1441
01:39:02,463 --> 01:39:02,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks good.

1442
01:39:03,243 --> 01:39:04,644
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some new stuff that they're adding.

1443
01:39:05,784 --> 01:39:08,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be the first Modern Warfare game that I'm actually going to get at launch.

1444
01:39:09,865 --> 01:39:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm finally caught up.

1445
01:39:12,526 --> 01:39:13,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Except it's not really Modern Warfare.

1446
01:39:13,886 --> 01:39:14,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's Future Warfare.

1447
01:39:16,027 --> 01:39:18,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about arcade games.

1448
01:39:18,728 --> 01:39:22,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually have Rumblefish on my arcade cabinet.

1449
01:39:22,809 --> 01:39:25,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really played a whole ton of it, but I have it emulated.

1450
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:30,991
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a game that was on Sammy's Autonomous Way, or was it

1451
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:34,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Atomos Wave, Arcade Hardware.

1452
01:39:34,633 --> 01:39:37,575
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a lot of other stuff like Dolphin Blue and stuff.

1453
01:39:38,075 --> 01:39:38,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a fighting game.

1454
01:39:38,896 --> 01:39:39,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty awesome.

1455
01:39:39,797 --> 01:39:45,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dimps, the company behind it, I guess, picked up the rights to it.

1456
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they're going to be re-releasing it on consoles.

1457
01:39:50,023 --> 01:39:51,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Or not consoles, I'm sorry, in arcades.

1458
01:39:52,405 --> 01:39:56,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're bringing Rumble Fish 2 to arcades.

1459
01:39:57,348 --> 01:39:58,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was in 2005.

1460
01:39:58,769 --> 01:40:00,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's coming back.

1461
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:05,973
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess it's on this new, was it Nessica Live?

1462
01:40:06,394 --> 01:40:07,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Nessica Cross Live?

1463
01:40:07,955 --> 01:40:18,964
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a streaming platform, but it's a platform where arcade owners can actually download games to cabinets.

1464
01:40:19,604 --> 01:40:19,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of...

1465
01:40:20,565 --> 01:40:21,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Digital download of arcade games.

1466
01:40:21,947 --> 01:40:22,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

1467
01:40:22,968 --> 01:40:27,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised that's only just now becoming a thing because that makes an awful lot of sense.

1468
01:40:27,894 --> 01:40:30,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot a shout out I wanted to do at Startup Part B. I'm so sorry.

1469
01:40:30,617 --> 01:40:31,498
[SPEAKER_09]: This is so important.

1470
01:40:31,959 --> 01:40:34,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so pissed I didn't get to go this year.

1471
01:40:34,341 --> 01:40:35,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm just juggling priorities.

1472
01:40:35,923 --> 01:40:36,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan went.

1473
01:40:36,704 --> 01:40:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, California Extreme was this weekend, and I got sent pictures and video, and apparently they had a full-on Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, I don't know if it was Chuck E. Cheese, but one of the likes, animatronic band that would sit there and creepily play songs, because I got sent a video of one.

1474
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:52,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I should show this to Marissa.

1475
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:52,611
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1476
01:40:53,071 --> 01:40:53,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1477
01:40:53,211 --> 01:41:00,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, you never really think of that because there's a lot of Chuck E. Cheese's that have closed down or just upgraded and stuff.

1478
01:41:00,793 --> 01:41:04,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope I didn't get that wrong, but it's that style.

1479
01:41:04,774 --> 01:41:07,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to have the old Bullwinkle's stuff.

1480
01:41:07,775 --> 01:41:08,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's what this is.

1481
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:08,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1482
01:41:08,935 --> 01:41:10,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm going to hand that to Marissa.

1483
01:41:10,635 --> 01:41:13,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Hit play and hold it so that Loki can see it too.

1484
01:41:13,556 --> 01:41:14,957
[SPEAKER_09]: That way you guys can kind of check that out.

1485
01:41:14,977 --> 01:41:16,597
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I was sent from California Extreme.

1486
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:21,721
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're singing Total Eclipse of the Heart.

1487
01:41:22,582 --> 01:41:23,983
[SPEAKER_09]: That is pretty amazing.

1488
01:41:24,003 --> 01:41:25,844
[SPEAKER_09]: That would give me nightmares.

1489
01:41:27,205 --> 01:41:28,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Neil sent that there.

1490
01:41:29,146 --> 01:41:32,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just put that out in my front yard all year round.

1491
01:41:33,848 --> 01:41:36,650
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a matronic band.

1492
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:40,312
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Halloween, put a fucking pumpkin in front of them.

1493
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:42,394
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Christmas, put Santa hats on them.

1494
01:41:44,135 --> 01:41:45,358
[SPEAKER_09]: So shout out to California Stream.

1495
01:41:45,438 --> 01:41:46,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry I couldn't make it this year.

1496
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,466
[SPEAKER_09]: The shadow casting was this weekend too.

1497
01:41:48,486 --> 01:41:49,790
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what would only make that thing better?

1498
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:50,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

1499
01:41:50,973 --> 01:41:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: If they would fucking just, you know...

1500
01:41:54,255 --> 01:41:57,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I have arcade hardware I guess I could download games to.

1501
01:41:57,936 --> 01:42:00,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Not entirely legally, but you know.

1502
01:42:18,942 --> 01:42:20,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, that's a cool idea, I guess.

1503
01:42:23,485 --> 01:42:25,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and then of course, this is kind of cool.

1504
01:42:26,347 --> 01:42:28,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a game that we kind of liked a while back.

1505
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:30,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Puzzle Quest.

1506
01:42:30,689 --> 01:42:32,911
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out a couple games and kind of disappeared.

1507
01:42:33,791 --> 01:42:35,312
[SPEAKER_06]: But now Puzzle Quest is coming back.

1508
01:42:35,773 --> 01:42:44,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently this is kind of... Because Firement, the company that put out the game, I guess they...

1509
01:42:48,169 --> 01:43:13,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Firemint is now putting out the game because they purchased Infinite Interactive which was the original creator of the game and so now it's coming back Puzzle Quest 2 is pretty awesome and it was on like every system out there and I'm not talking about the Galactic one that didn't do so well but the actual Puzzle Quest 2 was really good Puzzle Quest is a pretty cool game I wasn't a fan of the Galactic one but I would be down for more of the old Puzzle Quest

1510
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:15,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates

1511
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:40,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I got a couple stories for you guys here.

1512
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:44,553
[SPEAKER_09]: First one is about New Super Mario Bros.

1513
01:43:44,893 --> 01:43:44,553
2.

1514
01:43:45,313 --> 01:43:48,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know it had a working title called New Super Mario Bros.

1515
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:49,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Gold?

1516
01:43:49,095 --> 01:43:50,656
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, that was supposed to be the name.

1517
01:43:51,257 --> 01:43:52,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, they've kind of been saying this a lot.

1518
01:43:53,478 --> 01:43:54,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Even at E3 when they were talking about it.

1519
01:43:55,239 --> 01:43:57,181
[SPEAKER_09]: What does Mario love more than anything?

1520
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Gold coins!

1521
01:43:58,261 --> 01:43:59,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And this new game's all about coins.

1522
01:43:59,582 --> 01:44:00,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Smoke and shrooms.

1523
01:44:00,683 --> 01:44:12,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently, it was about, excuse me, it was so much a part of the game that it was originally going to be called New Super Mario Bros.

1524
01:44:12,892 --> 01:44:13,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Gold.

1525
01:44:13,613 --> 01:44:15,855
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, they went back and called it New Super Mario Bros.

1526
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:15,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Gold.

1527
01:44:15,975 --> 01:44:21,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were worried that too many people would think it's just, you know, cheapy or a cheap rehash of the first one.

1528
01:44:21,899 --> 01:44:22,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1529
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:24,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1530
01:44:38,386 --> 01:44:46,550
[SPEAKER_09]: A comment from Crytek is our next story about the Wii U. We've been getting more and more developers commenting on this.

1531
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:52,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Producer Mike Reed mentioned that Crytek is talking about working with Nintendo.

1532
01:44:52,833 --> 01:44:57,175
[SPEAKER_09]: A version of Crysis 3 for Wii U should not be ruled out.

1533
01:44:57,596 --> 01:45:02,518
[SPEAKER_09]: He would not confirm if it's in development or not, but it's sounding pretty likely.

1534
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:05,820
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's a quote from ComputerVideoGames.com.

1535
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:07,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1536
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:35,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

1537
01:45:36,431 --> 01:45:39,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Their hardware is pretty much on par with the current consoles.

1538
01:45:39,873 --> 01:45:41,574
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that hard to port that over.

1539
01:45:41,634 --> 01:45:43,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're porting other games over.

1540
01:45:43,795 --> 01:45:46,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, of course there's going to be that.

1541
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:52,879
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what the stipulation is going to be, what's Nintendo require from these people putting out stuff for their platform?

1542
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:56,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they making them, hey, you've got to have some unique gameplay that involves their tablet.

1543
01:45:57,862 --> 01:46:00,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And them figuring out, well, how are we going to...

1544
01:46:02,404 --> 01:46:07,289
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop, Target, some of them have the console backordered

1545
01:46:22,225 --> 01:46:25,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Some best buys and so forth are just now getting stock in again.

1546
01:46:25,406 --> 01:46:26,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing, though.

1547
01:46:26,847 --> 01:46:42,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people are drawing from this that either Nintendo's about to do a new holiday bundle, so they're trying to get rid of what's on shelves now, or this is in preparation for the Wii U. They might be trying to clean out the old stuff a little bit to make room for the Wii U. Loki, any insider thoughts from your perspective?

1548
01:46:42,853 --> 01:46:43,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

1549
01:46:43,613 --> 01:46:46,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen a lot of demand for the systems.

1550
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:49,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think if they're trying to clear out stock that they wouldn't be on backorder.

1551
01:46:49,854 --> 01:46:55,036
[SPEAKER_06]: They would be in plentiful supply because they're trying to get rid of them.

1552
01:46:55,336 --> 01:46:59,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Nintendo is sitting on consoles right now.

1553
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:04,058
[SPEAKER_06]: It could just be that they're switching production from...

1554
01:47:06,559 --> 01:47:07,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows how long it's going to be.

1555
01:47:07,681 --> 01:47:17,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that they've got to start producing these consoles, so maybe they're starting to switch over some of those manufacturers that are doing the Wii to making the Wii U system instead, just to get prepared.

1556
01:47:19,660 --> 01:47:22,142
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura's Stories GameGuru Why isn't Wario the villain here?

1557
01:47:22,162 --> 01:47:22,783
[SPEAKER_09]: He loves coins.

1558
01:47:37,697 --> 01:47:38,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Golf clap, golf clap

1559
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:08,256
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1560
01:48:23,032 --> 01:48:24,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's two different DLC packs.

1561
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:27,519
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them, like I said, is the Disney Princesses.

1562
01:48:28,681 --> 01:48:32,026
[SPEAKER_03]: The costume pack one has Aurora, Cinderella, Jasmine, and Snow White.

1563
01:48:32,126 --> 01:48:36,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second one is Belle, Tiana, Rapunzel, and Ariel.

1564
01:48:37,193 --> 01:48:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

1565
01:48:39,008 --> 01:48:42,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, we have some information about Dance Central 3.

1566
01:48:44,312 --> 01:48:48,975
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the songs that are going to be out on it.

1567
01:48:49,976 --> 01:48:53,859
[SPEAKER_03]: As some of these people, I really do not know who they are.

1568
01:48:53,879 --> 01:48:54,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of them I do.

1569
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:58,682
[SPEAKER_03]: To anyone, whoever the fuck that is, I am the best.

1570
01:48:58,882 --> 01:49:00,323
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Alice DJ, Better Off Alone.

1571
01:49:00,423 --> 01:49:01,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking love that song.

1572
01:49:02,484 --> 01:49:03,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that song.

1573
01:49:04,185 --> 01:49:10,908
[SPEAKER_03]: JJ Fad, Lil Jon and the East Side Boys featuring Yin Yang Twins, whatever.

1574
01:49:11,688 --> 01:49:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: LMFAO, Los Del Rio.

1575
01:49:14,529 --> 01:49:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Maroon 5 with moves like Jagger.

1576
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:18,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really like that song.

1577
01:49:19,631 --> 01:49:21,212
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Ice Ice Baby.

1578
01:49:22,512 --> 01:49:25,974
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Vicky Sue Robinson, Turn the Beat Around, and Village People YMCA.

1579
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to Alice DJ?

1580
01:49:30,904 --> 01:49:32,808
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like my college years right there.

1581
01:49:32,848 --> 01:49:34,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Alice DJ is better off alone.

1582
01:49:35,052 --> 01:49:35,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently.

1583
01:49:37,037 --> 01:49:43,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, last but never least, the Nintendo 3DS XL UK price.

1584
01:49:43,961 --> 01:49:45,802
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be $179.99.

1585
01:49:47,323 --> 01:49:48,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's in pounds.

1586
01:49:49,465 --> 01:49:55,288
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Tesco's, however, will be offering the device for 175 pounds.

1587
01:49:56,329 --> 01:49:58,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you want it cheap, get it at Tesco's.

1588
01:50:00,605 --> 01:50:09,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Game, one more, has a trade-in deal that for $79.99 you can trade in an old boxed 3DS and get the 3DS XL.

1589
01:50:11,395 --> 01:50:11,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that.

1590
01:50:12,455 --> 01:50:12,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad.

1591
01:50:13,216 --> 01:50:14,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad, not bad.

1592
01:50:15,718 --> 01:50:17,500
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, moving on.

1593
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:22,184
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a segment we always do here on Orange Lawns Radio called the Fugle Question of the Week.

1594
01:50:24,366 --> 01:50:25,466
[SPEAKER_09]: You might be asking yourself...

1595
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:29,960
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell is a foogle?

1596
01:50:31,663 --> 01:50:34,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Put Facebook and Google Plus together and you get foogle.

1597
01:50:35,368 --> 01:50:35,969
[SPEAKER_09]: That is what it is.

1598
01:50:36,389 --> 01:50:40,856
[SPEAKER_09]: We ask a question each week in our Facebook and Google Plus communities and you guys answer it.

1599
01:50:40,916 --> 01:50:41,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's this week's question.

1600
01:50:43,086 --> 01:50:50,848
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple betas going on right now, including Guild Wars 2, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and Sony PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, just to name a few.

1601
01:50:51,589 --> 01:50:56,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever made a decision whether or not to buy a game based off the beta?

1602
01:50:56,950 --> 01:51:05,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering that betas are unfinished products, do you think that it was a fair decision, or should a company not put it out there if it's not ready to be judged?

1603
01:51:07,208 --> 01:51:09,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was a good question, not just because I thought of it.

1604
01:51:10,692 --> 01:51:12,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's get to some of these comments here.

1605
01:51:13,354 --> 01:51:16,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to start with Google Plus tonight.

1606
01:51:17,999 --> 01:51:20,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, there are people posting on Google Plus.

1607
01:51:20,682 --> 01:51:22,164
[SPEAKER_04]: A quick impression of Google Plus.

1608
01:51:22,524 --> 01:51:22,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello!

1609
01:51:23,685 --> 01:51:24,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hello!

1610
01:51:25,807 --> 01:51:28,730
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we have two comments from Google Plus tonight.

1611
01:51:29,871 --> 01:51:31,733
[SPEAKER_09]: There's at least two people using Google+.

1612
01:51:32,934 --> 01:51:33,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Some weeks we get four.

1613
01:51:34,836 --> 01:51:41,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Redertainment says, No, but I did buy cakes prolonging the magic after listening to Alpha Beta Parking Lot.

1614
01:51:42,142 --> 01:51:43,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Is he plugging something?

1615
01:51:43,903 --> 01:51:44,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1616
01:51:45,785 --> 01:51:47,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Had nothing to do with the question, sir.

1617
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:50,243
[SPEAKER_09]: However, FlacoJones responded saying,

1618
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:06,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was a beta that ended up being pretty accurate, I gotta say.

1619
01:52:06,643 --> 01:52:09,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Good reminder, FlacoJones.

1620
01:52:10,086 --> 01:52:12,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Going to Facebook for some of the comments from Facebook.

1621
01:52:12,188 --> 01:52:22,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, Amanda R says, I've played in betas that were out only a couple weeks before game release, and by this time, these are mostly finished products with only minor tweaks being made.

1622
01:52:23,058 --> 01:52:48,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I've made the decision to not buy a game when it came out because the beta was just not fun and with that close to the release not enough changes were going to be made to change the game in any significant way Cody T says I've played betas of a million games and I think I've bought most I think betas are more for the developer than for the consumer it's a cheap way to see exactly what is wrong with the game by the best judge us and it's a way for the gamer to be involved in the actual development of the game

1623
01:52:51,081 --> 01:53:11,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Nick M responds saying I believe a public or large closed beta is the only responsible decision for game companies if their game relies heavily on multiplayer due to the large amount of problems that will often otherwise show their head on launch day however more often than not betas talk me out of buying games that I'm already on the fence about

1624
01:53:12,735 --> 01:53:20,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Boshka responded and said, Yes, the only game I have ever done it for is a game that's actually free when it comes out, Path of Exile.

1625
01:53:20,761 --> 01:53:23,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Think Diablo 2 with new features and updated graphics.

1626
01:53:23,724 --> 01:53:29,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I donated $10 not only to get a second beta key for a friend, but because I love what they're doing with that game.

1627
01:53:29,268 --> 01:53:30,649
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could get more, I would.

1628
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:34,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard should take some notes on how to make a good action RPG.

1629
01:53:34,512 --> 01:53:35,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, sick burn.

1630
01:53:37,031 --> 01:53:37,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's fair.

1631
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,553
[SPEAKER_09]: People have to learn what a beta is for.

1632
01:53:39,653 --> 01:53:40,474
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a demo.

1633
01:53:40,494 --> 01:53:42,216
[SPEAKER_09]: You're testing buggy code.

1634
01:53:42,496 --> 01:53:46,319
[SPEAKER_09]: You're testing builds that are normally four to five builds behind what the devs have.

1635
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:49,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Some games basically require betas based on the sheer size.

1636
01:53:49,822 --> 01:53:58,110
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, in the Mists of Pandaria beta, they changed one ability for a boss fight and the next thing you know, there's an elevator coming out of the ground on another continent.

1637
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:10,892
[SPEAKER_09]: if the company says before that it's not a demo it's a beta I think that is completely fair if you don't get the difference you're not the type of tester they want anyway a long but good comment from Boshka let's see

1638
01:54:12,208 --> 01:54:12,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Wicked says,

1639
01:54:33,895 --> 01:54:43,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes the game does not live up to the overhype that sometimes follows certain open betas, or some good games could easily be overlooked due to negative reactions to betas.

1640
01:54:43,806 --> 01:54:49,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So while betas can easily help a game's development, it could easily skew the game's anticipation in the public eye.

1641
01:54:50,934 --> 01:54:54,578
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, Chiggers responds saying, I've bought games based on the demos.

1642
01:54:54,818 --> 01:54:55,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that count?

1643
01:54:57,753 --> 01:54:59,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Demos are a little different than betas.

1644
01:54:59,735 --> 01:55:05,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I think kind of going back to the other points, like betas are put out there because they're not supposed to be demos.

1645
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,481
[SPEAKER_09]: They're supposed to be tests for the developers.

1646
01:55:07,581 --> 01:55:13,106
[SPEAKER_09]: But kind of where I was trying to go with the question is that a lot of people look at betas as demos in this day and age.

1647
01:55:13,266 --> 01:55:18,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that fair or should the developers be real and realize that's how most people are going to view it?

1648
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:23,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, thanks for all those answers on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1649
01:55:24,993 --> 01:55:30,555
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't read them all, so please go check out the post to read some of the other great insights from this week.

1650
01:55:30,615 --> 01:55:31,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate it, guys.

1651
01:55:31,775 --> 01:55:34,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry I couldn't read them all, but it's only a three-hour show.

1652
01:55:37,497 --> 01:55:37,797
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1653
01:55:38,017 --> 01:55:44,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, X-Link giving me the update in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1654
01:55:44,679 --> 01:55:46,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what happened to Alice DJ.

1655
01:55:48,277 --> 01:55:58,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, after the group went their separate ways, Prank decided to move on to other ventures by putting her music career aside to become a makeup artist and beauty fashion consultant.

1656
01:56:00,021 --> 01:56:01,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the video.

1657
01:56:01,241 --> 01:56:03,782
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a very hip looking gal.

1658
01:56:03,822 --> 01:56:04,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

1659
01:56:04,422 --> 01:56:07,743
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually had like two videos for that song, Better Off Alone.

1660
01:56:08,483 --> 01:56:08,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1661
01:56:09,363 --> 01:56:11,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I learned something tonight about Alice DJ.

1662
01:56:11,424 --> 01:56:11,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knew?

1663
01:56:12,624 --> 01:56:15,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I've learned about pornography and I've learned about Alice DJ.

1664
01:56:17,799 --> 01:56:19,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa's hiding her head.

1665
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:19,940
[SPEAKER_03]: This is adorable.

1666
01:56:21,941 --> 01:56:22,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki!

1667
01:56:22,722 --> 01:56:25,483
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you got for us next in other gaming news?

1668
01:56:26,103 --> 01:56:26,423
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1669
01:56:27,024 --> 01:56:31,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk a little bit about Rock Band.

1670
01:56:31,326 --> 01:56:32,346
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is kind of funny because...

1671
01:56:33,829 --> 01:56:38,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys remember, a couple months back we had a scare where, hey, guess what?

1672
01:56:38,152 --> 01:56:41,735
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Rock Band that you purchase on iOS and stuff like that?

1673
01:56:41,955 --> 01:56:43,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being delisted.

1674
01:56:43,236 --> 01:56:44,357
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being taken away.

1675
01:56:45,117 --> 01:56:46,458
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know that game you just purchased?

1676
01:56:46,478 --> 01:56:51,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now it's going to be completely useless because you're not going to be able to get anything anymore for it.

1677
01:56:51,882 --> 01:56:53,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just going to be gone.

1678
01:56:54,564 --> 01:56:57,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and you may remember that they came out and said, oh, no, no, no.

1679
01:56:57,906 --> 01:56:58,547
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not happening.

1680
01:56:59,367 --> 01:57:00,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That message was sent an error.

1681
01:57:00,628 --> 01:57:01,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the error was that

1682
01:57:02,697 --> 01:57:06,618
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sent two months early because now, yes, they are actually delisting the game.

1683
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:11,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't think people were mad that the game was being delisted.

1684
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:12,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, whatever.

1685
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:15,141
[SPEAKER_09]: People are pissed if it wouldn't work anymore.

1686
01:57:15,381 --> 01:57:21,803
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the original, like, scare campaign going around is that, ha ha, you just bought this game and none of your DLC or anything's going to work anymore.

1687
01:57:22,044 --> 01:57:22,644
[SPEAKER_09]: LOL, bye.

1688
01:57:23,964 --> 01:57:25,646
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't appear to be the case.

1689
01:57:25,846 --> 01:57:27,887
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're just pulling it from the store, then whatever.

1690
01:57:28,008 --> 01:57:38,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're pulling basically the Rock Band iOS game and Rock Band Reloaded iOS game and I think all the DLC for it as well.

1691
01:57:38,596 --> 01:57:42,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you will not be able to purchase any more DLC for it.

1692
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:49,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's supposed to happen effective July 31st, so a couple days from now.

1693
01:57:52,529 --> 01:57:54,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah.

1694
01:57:54,631 --> 01:58:01,396
[SPEAKER_04]: As a musician, which actually just means unemployed.

1695
01:58:04,718 --> 01:58:14,986
[SPEAKER_04]: With regard to the music games, especially guitar players, games like Guitar Hero, especially at the time, at its height, really enraged musicians.

1696
01:58:15,006 --> 01:58:18,769
[SPEAKER_04]: They got so angry, especially since a lot of people were misinformed and they...

1697
01:58:20,689 --> 01:58:24,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I've even heard a lot of people ignorantly at GameStop believing that it could teach you how to play guitar.

1698
01:58:25,431 --> 01:58:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: However, my friend's mother ended up winning a free copy of Rocksmith, so we played it.

1699
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:37,814
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually one where they gave you an XLR cable and you could actually plug in your guitar to the Xbox.

1700
01:58:38,434 --> 01:58:39,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually was a pretty good game.

1701
01:58:40,135 --> 01:58:42,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You plug in your own guitar to it.

1702
01:58:43,317 --> 01:58:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I had guitar players play it and they actually found it challenging and interesting and it actually accurately presented theory and things like that.

1703
01:58:51,088 --> 01:58:52,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad you said that.

1704
01:58:52,450 --> 01:59:02,501
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't know this before you said that, but I usually have to refrain from comment on that game because a really good friend of mine knows somebody that's a big part of the development of that game.

1705
01:59:02,902 --> 01:59:08,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So I usually don't try to avoid the topic on the show because of conflict, but I'm glad you said that.

1706
01:59:08,228 --> 01:59:10,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that'll make somebody very happy to know that.

1707
01:59:10,464 --> 01:59:25,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't get that far into the game, but I enjoyed it, and I think that, you know, it's not going to turn you into a virtuoso, but I mean, you know, if you're too cheap to go get lessons immediately, it's a good place to start, just to get a very basic foundation, and it's fun.

1708
01:59:26,621 --> 01:59:56,450
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah I understand that game does have kind of quite a bit of like a cultish audience I don't want to sound like but like a lot of the makeup of I think who's into that game is kind of like people who are rediscovering getting into music maybe at a later age like it's not like kids and teenagers and so forth playing it that rock band tends to skew towards like college parties and stuff but like Rocksmith is like 30 somethings who always wanted to learn to play an instrument that never did I wasn't familiar with that I wish that they had I guess it didn't that's my impression it's not like just my impression of it

1709
01:59:56,830 --> 02:00:01,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, you know, my understanding is, you know, it didn't blow up necessarily.

1710
02:00:01,054 --> 02:00:06,678
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I wish that it had a wider library of music.

1711
02:00:06,758 --> 02:00:08,119
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it started to when it came out.

1712
02:00:08,139 --> 02:00:09,320
[SPEAKER_04]: They started releasing stuff all the time.

1713
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:10,621
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wish it had more, you know.

1714
02:00:11,281 --> 02:00:13,904
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, that's just selfishly because I think it'd be fun to play.

1715
02:00:14,284 --> 02:00:15,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they do DLC pretty regularly.

1716
02:00:16,105 --> 02:00:18,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're in luck because they have Rocksmith and Bass.

1717
02:00:19,548 --> 02:00:21,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Guitar and Bass coming out this October.

1718
02:00:21,890 --> 02:00:21,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1719
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:27,511
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need a game to teach you bass.

1720
02:00:28,251 --> 02:00:29,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.

1721
02:00:29,191 --> 02:00:30,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding, actually.

1722
02:00:31,292 --> 02:00:32,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It does require talent.

1723
02:00:33,572 --> 02:00:34,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Just not a lot.

1724
02:00:35,553 --> 02:00:37,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be a retarded monkey.

1725
02:00:37,813 --> 02:00:38,833
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, no.

1726
02:00:39,353 --> 02:00:40,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends like Freebo.

1727
02:00:40,234 --> 02:00:41,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends who are excellent bass players.

1728
02:00:42,354 --> 02:00:44,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the running musicians joke, making fun of bass players.

1729
02:00:45,395 --> 02:00:46,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1730
02:00:46,135 --> 02:00:46,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1731
02:00:49,216 --> 02:00:50,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you a fan of Green Day?

1732
02:00:51,378 --> 02:00:52,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Green Day, but let's be real.

1733
02:00:52,939 --> 02:00:57,502
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of their songs are kind of like the same chord over and over, and it cracked me up because he was sitting there.

1734
02:00:57,982 --> 02:01:00,224
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to be the guy that's lead singer of that band.

1735
02:01:00,244 --> 02:01:04,247
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to be one of the, not like a judge, but like a mentor or something on The Voice.

1736
02:01:04,867 --> 02:01:06,828
[SPEAKER_09]: But he's working with Christina Aguilera.

1737
02:01:07,389 --> 02:01:10,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know why, but I found that to be like the funniest thing I'd heard all week.

1738
02:01:10,951 --> 02:01:23,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you're not going to appreciate this, but any other musicians listening to this and the band that now knows my embarrassing past that I've told to tune into will appreciate this.

1739
02:01:25,286 --> 02:01:28,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Green Day is kind of like the Creedence Clearwater of their time.

1740
02:01:30,511 --> 02:01:31,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that sounds obtuse.

1741
02:01:32,373 --> 02:01:37,897
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's always this joke that Creedence Clearwater's songs and John Fogarty's songs only require three chords to play.

1742
02:01:39,098 --> 02:01:43,081
[SPEAKER_04]: There is something to be said about Green Day's later artistic merit.

1743
02:01:43,581 --> 02:01:50,046
[SPEAKER_04]: There are things to be appreciated about it, but do I think that they should be held in that high of a regard?

1744
02:01:50,627 --> 02:01:50,827
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1745
02:01:51,667 --> 02:01:53,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a member of the cult, though.

1746
02:01:54,209 --> 02:01:57,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate some of the things that they've done, but I'm not a cult member or anything.

1747
02:01:58,012 --> 02:02:05,874
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it's amazing where they've come, you know, singing songs about acne and masturbation to... With guitars that were out of tune.

1748
02:02:05,894 --> 02:02:08,334
[SPEAKER_09]: To, like, commentary on President Bush and so forth.

1749
02:02:08,374 --> 02:02:08,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1750
02:02:08,774 --> 02:02:09,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And that Broadway play.

1751
02:02:09,895 --> 02:02:11,655
[SPEAKER_04]: They've come so... Oh, God.

1752
02:02:11,735 --> 02:02:14,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, you all right over there?

1753
02:02:14,216 --> 02:02:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I like, you know, like, Green Day songs with, you know, fussy moves.

1754
02:02:22,446 --> 02:02:26,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Stan in our chatroom, you are spurring some music discussion in our chatroom.

1755
02:02:26,116 --> 02:02:28,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Stan says, same with Hanson.

1756
02:02:28,664 --> 02:02:30,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Mbop is only three chords.

1757
02:02:32,813 --> 02:02:34,193
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't even have three hits.

1758
02:02:37,414 --> 02:02:39,815
[SPEAKER_09]: They had like 30 babies between them all, though.

1759
02:02:39,835 --> 02:02:40,415
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that old joke?

1760
02:02:40,435 --> 02:02:42,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the girl at Hanson's pretty cute.

1761
02:02:46,137 --> 02:02:47,977
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they're actually all evangelicals.

1762
02:02:47,997 --> 02:02:48,718
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all really weird.

1763
02:02:48,758 --> 02:02:53,639
[SPEAKER_09]: That means Justin Bieber is like the Hanson of our time, basically.

1764
02:02:53,759 --> 02:02:55,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Justin Bieber have his own video game now, too?

1765
02:02:56,400 --> 02:02:57,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God, I hope not.

1766
02:02:57,765 --> 02:02:58,726
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't understand.

1767
02:02:58,746 --> 02:03:00,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Teenage girls are stupid.

1768
02:03:01,568 --> 02:03:03,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I said this is a former teenage girl.

1769
02:03:07,193 --> 02:03:12,557
[SPEAKER_09]: As one who was once a teenage girl, I have authority on this subject.

1770
02:03:12,737 --> 02:03:13,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1771
02:03:13,497 --> 02:03:16,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, I never had bought posters on my wall or anything.

1772
02:03:17,143 --> 02:03:18,023
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, dear.

1773
02:03:18,164 --> 02:03:19,664
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you get for being younger than me.

1774
02:03:20,565 --> 02:03:21,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I had new kids on the block.

1775
02:03:22,245 --> 02:03:23,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone can shut up.

1776
02:03:23,486 --> 02:03:27,608
[SPEAKER_04]: The kids at my school called me Daria.

1777
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:32,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was very much the anti that.

1778
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:42,974
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing that people don't get about this, and of course, yes, it's interesting how the media will exploit everything when it comes to a tween star like this, including the areas of video games and apps and all this crap.

1779
02:03:42,994 --> 02:03:44,035
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just...

1780
02:03:44,995 --> 02:04:02,332
[SPEAKER_04]: just they just found a boy to fill the slot of cute teenage boy singing songs to seduce it could have been anyone you know they just to just put him in the spot and they put the marketing you know movement behind him and done it could have been anybody had nothing to do with who Justin Bieber is nothing sorry

1781
02:04:02,592 --> 02:04:03,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I just opened Pandora's box.

1782
02:04:19,002 --> 02:04:29,405
[SPEAKER_04]: If Katy Perry gets her own movie, I should have my own quadruple sequel and then miniseries and TV shows.

1783
02:04:30,506 --> 02:04:33,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's face it, she got the movie because of her titties.

1784
02:04:36,604 --> 02:04:44,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, she has some cute songs, blah, blah, blah, but mainly it's because she's beautiful, you know, and people like talking about her boobies, apparently.

1785
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:45,410
[SPEAKER_04]: And Elmo.

1786
02:04:45,811 --> 02:04:47,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I deserve my own series.

1787
02:04:48,052 --> 02:04:49,753
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be a Star Trek next to that.

1788
02:04:50,394 --> 02:04:55,517
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be like four TV series, what is it, like nine movies and fanfic.

1789
02:04:55,677 --> 02:04:59,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if her movies alone get her a movie, I deserve so much more.

1790
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:00,621
Yeah.

1791
02:05:01,348 --> 02:05:03,130
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, here's what fascinates me.

1792
02:05:04,070 --> 02:05:05,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Katy Perry has some catchy songs, whatever.

1793
02:05:06,893 --> 02:05:08,294
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're drunk at a gay bar, you don't care.

1794
02:05:08,374 --> 02:05:09,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Katy Perry!

1795
02:05:09,195 --> 02:05:10,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I love her!

1796
02:05:10,877 --> 02:05:12,838
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a big marketing team, too.

1797
02:05:13,459 --> 02:05:14,220
[SPEAKER_09]: She's kind of a tool.

1798
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:20,425
[SPEAKER_09]: But then, you have LCD Sound System had their big farewell thing and all that.

1799
02:05:20,865 --> 02:05:21,586
[SPEAKER_09]: What did they get?

1800
02:05:21,646 --> 02:05:23,468
[SPEAKER_09]: They got a Fathom event.

1801
02:05:24,088 --> 02:05:24,769
They got like

1802
02:05:25,336 --> 02:05:28,658
[SPEAKER_09]: They're movies like one night only at the local cinema.

1803
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:31,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Life is not fair.

1804
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:34,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the Metropolitan Opera, you know, movie theater night, you know.

1805
02:05:36,204 --> 02:05:36,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor guys.

1806
02:05:37,004 --> 02:05:37,305
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1807
02:05:38,605 --> 02:05:38,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1808
02:05:40,327 --> 02:05:44,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in our chat room says, Marissa, the movie 2, Electit Bubalu.

1809
02:05:44,089 --> 02:05:48,452
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be the name of your next album.

1810
02:05:48,893 --> 02:05:49,253
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1811
02:05:49,813 --> 02:05:50,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1812
02:05:52,028 --> 02:05:53,391
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how Katy Perry sells shit.

1813
02:05:53,451 --> 02:05:54,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it too.

1814
02:05:55,596 --> 02:05:59,425
[SPEAKER_09]: You just, you just, you gotta get out of the Lilith Fair and get into the pop music.

1815
02:05:59,465 --> 02:05:59,946
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need to...

1816
02:06:00,818 --> 02:06:05,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Just whine about a boy who broke up with you years ago or something.

1817
02:06:05,980 --> 02:06:07,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Just sing about Dave Coulier.

1818
02:06:10,201 --> 02:06:15,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Insult the women that actually are gay and can't help it and pretend to be a lesbian to amuse men.

1819
02:06:15,983 --> 02:06:16,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1820
02:06:17,764 --> 02:06:19,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Get in a pillow fight.

1821
02:06:19,104 --> 02:06:20,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Braid somebody's hair.

1822
02:06:21,505 --> 02:06:22,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze someone's bra.

1823
02:06:23,606 --> 02:06:24,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to do that.

1824
02:06:24,306 --> 02:06:27,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Dip a bra in orange juice and put it in the freezer for the first girl who fell asleep.

1825
02:06:29,581 --> 02:06:29,941
[SPEAKER_09]: That's hot.

1826
02:06:29,981 --> 02:06:30,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep talking.

1827
02:06:30,782 --> 02:06:31,042
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1828
02:06:31,662 --> 02:06:32,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1829
02:06:33,763 --> 02:06:34,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1830
02:06:34,764 --> 02:06:40,607
[SPEAKER_09]: This is bad because we're going to go from such humorous, happy discussions to really unfortunate situations.

1831
02:06:43,302 --> 02:06:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about to Debbie Downer the show a little bit and talk about some layoffs.

1832
02:06:50,225 --> 02:06:51,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop laughing, Marissa.

1833
02:06:51,146 --> 02:06:51,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Inappropriate.

1834
02:06:52,966 --> 02:06:54,467
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this news really does suck.

1835
02:06:55,388 --> 02:06:56,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should skip this story.

1836
02:06:57,569 --> 02:06:59,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, go.

1837
02:06:59,210 --> 02:06:59,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Read it already.

1838
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:00,970
[SPEAKER_03]: We need variety.

1839
02:07:01,431 --> 02:07:03,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh, Marissa's choking.

1840
02:07:05,933 --> 02:07:06,233
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1841
02:07:08,254 --> 02:07:08,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Serious face.

1842
02:07:10,805 --> 02:07:16,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft laid off a small, as they put it, number of positions at their Vancouver-based development studio.

1843
02:07:16,869 --> 02:07:23,032
[SPEAKER_09]: This is because Project Columbia, whatever this was, we don't know what the real name was, it got canceled.

1844
02:07:23,173 --> 02:07:24,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's off the books now.

1845
02:07:24,693 --> 02:07:26,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be an educational Connect title.

1846
02:07:27,235 --> 02:07:28,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It was going to educate young people.

1847
02:07:28,796 --> 02:07:31,357
[SPEAKER_09]: It was going to pair books with music and illustrations.

1848
02:07:31,758 --> 02:07:35,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it had something to do with the Sesame Workshop as well.

1849
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:40,203
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't necessarily mean it was a Sesame Street game, but it sounds like it was something that was kind of geared towards kids.

1850
02:07:40,783 --> 02:08:08,758
[SPEAKER_09]: or the like Wonderbook Connect and then they saw the Wonderbook presentation like wow that looks like shit and then they're like woo scrap that perhaps but layoffs are never good news especially also when they hit Warner Brothers Seattle also had some layoffs hit them this week they were currently working on Lord of the Rings Guardians of Middle Earth and if you might be thinking to yourself god they're still making Lord of the Rings games well there's a Hobbit movie coming out at the end of the year you might have heard of it it's a big deal

1851
02:08:09,378 --> 02:08:10,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, moolah moolah.

1852
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:13,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, not enough moolah, apparently.

1853
02:08:13,922 --> 02:08:25,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Layoffs hit the studio once back in November that was supposed to be 60 people, and a statement from WB says, quote, due to shifting business imperatives, Warner Brothers Games Seattle has made staff reductions.

1854
02:08:25,811 --> 02:08:29,514
[SPEAKER_09]: The group will continue to remain an integral part of Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment.

1855
02:08:30,075 --> 02:08:30,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Yikes.

1856
02:08:30,956 --> 02:08:34,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, since I would like to end with a little bit of a positive...

1857
02:08:35,559 --> 02:08:39,142
[SPEAKER_09]: ID Software, ID Software, you know, they made like Doom and shit.

1858
02:08:39,162 --> 02:08:42,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, they are actually hiring right now.

1859
02:08:43,025 --> 02:08:51,851
[SPEAKER_09]: They are hiring on their website for a UI programmer job for, quote, an unannounced game on future generation consoles.

1860
02:08:52,372 --> 02:08:56,615
[SPEAKER_09]: So could it be something that is a sequel to one of the past franchises?

1861
02:08:56,975 --> 02:09:02,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Possibly, because the listing actually says, quote, familiarity with ID Software games, characters, brands, and universes.

1862
02:09:03,260 --> 02:09:03,500
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

1863
02:09:24,958 --> 02:09:31,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, in other news... How about something about that PlayStation All-Stars crap that's coming out?

1864
02:09:32,728 --> 02:09:33,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you think it's crap?

1865
02:09:34,610 --> 02:09:35,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1866
02:09:35,090 --> 02:09:36,552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you really feel.

1867
02:09:36,732 --> 02:09:37,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we're gonna have beta.

1868
02:09:37,854 --> 02:09:40,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody we know very well has been in the beta.

1869
02:09:40,056 --> 02:09:41,598
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna have beta impressions in a little bit.

1870
02:09:42,640 --> 02:09:44,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not necessarily going to call it crap.

1871
02:09:44,462 --> 02:09:45,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to call it potential crap.

1872
02:09:46,785 --> 02:09:58,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some people who have gone through the data files for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and has nine stages, eight characters, and a bunch of other stuff.

1873
02:09:59,521 --> 02:10:20,816
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have is a Bioshock Infinite stage, Sir Daniel Fortescue from Medieval, Dante from Devil May Cry, Spike from Ape Escape, Raiden from Metal Gear Solid, Nariko from Heavenly Sword, and we've got David Hader saying he's recording dialogue.

1874
02:10:22,262 --> 02:10:26,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Dante, Evil Cole, Nariko, Raiden, Sackboy, Ratchet & Clank, Sir Daniel Fortescue, Spike Atomizer

1875
02:10:46,154 --> 02:11:09,794
[SPEAKER_03]: the Balmusu Axe, Boots of Hermes, Freeze Missile, Golf Club from Hot Shots Golf, Gravity Shield from Wipeout, Hedgehog Grenade, the Dovat Laser Designator, Leech Beam, Murder of Crows from Bioshock, Railgun, Razor Claws, RPG, Scythe, Spear, Sonic Rift, and Sackbot.

1876
02:11:11,075 --> 02:11:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: and then supporting characters as in Minions, Captain Quark, Kai from Heavenly Sword, Kat from Devil May Cry, Kia, Monkey from Ape Escape, Nyx, Pierre from Doko Demo Isho, Sackbot, and Sam from Metal Gear Rising.

1877
02:11:28,048 --> 02:11:37,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says, there's like just a bunch of modes, but as far as stage goes, there's Alden's Tower, Black Rock Stadium, Columbia, Franzia from Loco Roco.

1878
02:11:37,996 --> 02:11:38,917
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually looks pretty neat.

1879
02:11:39,717 --> 02:11:41,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't Franzia boxed wine as well?

1880
02:11:42,038 --> 02:11:43,119
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's Franzia.

1881
02:11:43,519 --> 02:11:44,440
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Franzia.

1882
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:45,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my bad.

1883
02:11:47,241 --> 02:11:48,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa and I think alike.

1884
02:11:49,362 --> 02:11:49,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Tip it!

1885
02:11:50,103 --> 02:11:51,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Tip it, Kathleen, tip it!

1886
02:11:51,743 --> 02:11:56,146
[SPEAKER_03]: We think like old 50-year-old... I'm sorry, I think of Kathy Griffin.

1887
02:11:56,186 --> 02:11:57,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I do too.

1888
02:11:57,106 --> 02:12:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco from Resistance, Stowaways from Uncharted, Time Station from Ape Escape.

1889
02:12:02,029 --> 02:12:04,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm most excited about LocoRoco stage, really.

1890
02:12:05,711 --> 02:12:08,332
[SPEAKER_06]: And all these were hacked from files from the beta.

1891
02:12:08,803 --> 02:12:08,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1892
02:12:10,204 --> 02:12:10,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Hacker's gonna hack.

1893
02:12:11,504 --> 02:12:12,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1894
02:12:12,605 --> 02:12:13,686
[SPEAKER_09]: People should know that by now.

1895
02:12:13,806 --> 02:12:14,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Hack like what?

1896
02:12:15,407 --> 02:12:17,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking forward to playing as Parappa.

1897
02:12:17,728 --> 02:12:18,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the game looks fun.

1898
02:12:18,808 --> 02:12:20,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1899
02:12:21,110 --> 02:12:25,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let the person who's gonna review the beta in a minute here, which we just talked about.

1900
02:12:25,612 --> 02:12:26,873
[SPEAKER_09]: You shouldn't do that, but hey.

1901
02:12:26,893 --> 02:12:34,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is, I believe, against the end-user license agreement, or was it the confidentiality agreement?

1902
02:12:34,877 --> 02:12:37,219
[SPEAKER_03]: This... We ain't the ones gonna get sued over it.

1903
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:38,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Ain't our asses.

1904
02:12:38,821 --> 02:12:39,281
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not me.

1905
02:12:39,461 --> 02:12:40,462
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not me playing it.

1906
02:12:40,922 --> 02:12:42,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a special tipster.

1907
02:12:42,564 --> 02:12:50,590
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll break out the voice disguiser and the shadow everything so they aren't identified.

1908
02:12:50,630 --> 02:12:53,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this person's using someone else's beta.

1909
02:12:54,353 --> 02:12:57,916
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's even like... I know, right?

1910
02:12:58,977 --> 02:12:59,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1911
02:13:02,039 --> 02:13:02,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

1912
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:03,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1913
02:13:05,424 --> 02:13:07,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish I was in a beta test for that game.

1914
02:13:08,106 --> 02:13:08,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks awesome.

1915
02:13:09,707 --> 02:13:33,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, give me the logon and password so I can get into... So there was a hack that was demonstrated by a Russian hacker using basically a way to spoof the Apple Store servers to allow him to make free in-app purchases.

1916
02:13:34,861 --> 02:13:35,742
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

1917
02:14:03,351 --> 02:14:05,692
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, it's going to slow everything down.

1918
02:14:07,092 --> 02:14:09,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for ruining it for everybody.

1919
02:14:09,233 --> 02:14:09,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate that.

1920
02:14:09,793 --> 02:14:17,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it's going to require that these people that publish these apps are going to need to update their apps with a new API for it.

1921
02:14:19,856 --> 02:14:22,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how they're going to... How's that really going to work?

1922
02:14:22,379 --> 02:14:32,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, say, for example, I use that glitch or whatever or that exploit to purchase a bunch of tower bucks or something in Tiny Tower and then I spend all of them.

1923
02:14:32,350 --> 02:14:34,132
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you going to take that away?

1924
02:14:34,933 --> 02:14:37,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't see how it's going to work.

1925
02:14:37,355 --> 02:14:38,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you can at that point.

1926
02:14:38,897 --> 02:14:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think for consumables like that, I don't think you can actually do anything.

1927
02:14:42,982 --> 02:14:52,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, like, okay, if I purchase, you know, songs from Rock Band or something like that, it's going to check to make sure that I actually purchased those and then go from there, but

1928
02:14:54,707 --> 02:14:55,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1929
02:15:19,892 --> 02:15:20,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed

1930
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:50,433
[SPEAKER_09]: He's basically implying that the characters could be different depending on which platform you purchase the game on.

1931
02:15:50,973 --> 02:15:51,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote,

1932
02:16:03,659 --> 02:16:07,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Over all the different platforms, this totals up to 29 actual playable choices.

1933
02:16:08,063 --> 02:16:11,506
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't mean there are 29 playable choices in all platforms.

1934
02:16:11,906 --> 02:16:14,008
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, no single platform has all 29.

1935
02:16:14,748 --> 02:16:17,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Some drop down to the low 20s, some instead have high 20s.

1936
02:16:18,191 --> 02:16:18,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is this?

1937
02:16:18,952 --> 02:16:22,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, some platforms have characters that are unique to that platform.

1938
02:16:22,594 --> 02:16:25,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to say which, that's part of the fun of the reveals.

1939
02:16:25,717 --> 02:16:27,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Some are Sega characters, some are not.

1940
02:16:28,239 --> 02:16:29,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't bother asking.

1941
02:16:29,918 --> 02:16:32,320
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1942
02:16:54,296 --> 02:17:04,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe the reason why it's exclusive on the Nintendo platforms is also they're kicking in some money for marketing as well for the Activision game.

1943
02:17:04,662 --> 02:17:06,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes sense.

1944
02:17:06,823 --> 02:17:07,183
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

1945
02:17:07,203 --> 02:17:07,704
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

1946
02:17:08,924 --> 02:17:09,405
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1947
02:17:09,465 --> 02:17:13,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's take a look at our mailbag.

1948
02:17:13,367 --> 02:17:16,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1949
02:17:20,129 --> 02:17:24,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and reads a few emails for you.

1950
02:17:24,711 --> 02:17:32,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Now, DarkSakura, when you weren't here last week, there was like eight emails sent to the show.

1951
02:17:32,774 --> 02:17:35,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So we only read half of them and we saved the other half for you.

1952
02:17:35,354 --> 02:17:37,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's three that I saw.

1953
02:17:37,255 --> 02:17:39,276
[SPEAKER_09]: These might be the leftovers from last week.

1954
02:17:39,396 --> 02:17:39,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1955
02:17:39,996 --> 02:17:40,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is July 22nd, so...

1956
02:17:42,997 --> 02:17:45,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, greetings OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

1957
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:48,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to share how much I love Steam sales and boo to Origin.

1958
02:17:49,822 --> 02:17:54,465
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who doesn't need many games on release days, I always wait for the Steam sales.

1959
02:17:54,645 --> 02:17:55,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for this holiday.

1960
02:17:56,446 --> 02:17:59,749
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, please share the damage that Steam did to each of you.

1961
02:18:00,189 --> 02:18:02,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.

1962
02:18:02,210 --> 02:18:04,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I just bought Borderlands, that's all.

1963
02:18:05,052 --> 02:18:10,602
[SPEAKER_09]: We ended up actually talking about the Steam sale last week a little bit, so I'll kind of point you back to that show.

1964
02:18:10,662 --> 02:18:13,808
[SPEAKER_09]: But DarkSakura, that was the only damage it did to you, was Borderlands?

1965
02:18:14,008 --> 02:18:14,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, pretty much.

1966
02:18:14,710 --> 02:18:15,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll have to play together sometime.

1967
02:18:17,065 --> 02:18:18,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to actually install it.

1968
02:18:18,586 --> 02:18:19,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, you ever use Steam?

1969
02:18:19,666 --> 02:18:23,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you're not a huge, huge gamer girl, but you like the adventure games.

1970
02:18:23,147 --> 02:18:27,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta say, Steam is a good place to look for some of the newer stuff if you're into adventure games.

1971
02:18:27,269 --> 02:18:27,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1972
02:18:27,809 --> 02:18:31,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not, but I probably should because I have the same recommendation as well.

1973
02:18:31,311 --> 02:18:35,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because some of that stuff goes on sale like dirt cheap sometimes.

1974
02:18:35,572 --> 02:18:38,353
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually have a LucasArts pack.

1975
02:18:38,453 --> 02:18:39,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Something's missing from it.

1976
02:18:39,974 --> 02:18:44,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, Maniac Mansion because that was the Maniac Mansion sequel was the game of the week last week.

1977
02:18:45,596 --> 02:18:52,021
[SPEAKER_09]: and because we let Alan pick when you were out and he picked the Day of the Tentacle and that was one of the LucasArts games that's missing from that pack.

1978
02:18:52,581 --> 02:18:56,344
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can get, I think it has like Loom and some of the other things that DarkSakura has picked in the past.

1979
02:18:56,404 --> 02:18:58,066
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the big things on there.

1980
02:18:58,126 --> 02:18:59,627
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, pretty cool.

1981
02:19:01,088 --> 02:19:01,348
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1982
02:19:02,486 --> 02:19:04,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, next email.

1983
02:19:05,929 --> 02:19:07,631
[SPEAKER_03]: The subject is Garrus.

1984
02:19:08,271 --> 02:19:09,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts off, Garrus.

1985
02:19:09,732 --> 02:19:10,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello sentient creatures.

1986
02:19:11,434 --> 02:19:13,536
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a media event that I'm sure you are aware of.

1987
02:19:13,596 --> 02:19:18,920
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that people have been eagerly anticipating and have been looking forward to for a while.

1988
02:19:19,021 --> 02:19:21,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also sure that many of us out there saw this media event.

1989
02:19:22,003 --> 02:19:28,791
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are some of us who haven't seen the media event or have yet to see this media event in its entirety.

1990
02:19:29,372 --> 02:19:31,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for this reason that I email you today.

1991
02:19:31,575 --> 02:19:34,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, for the sake of all of us who haven't seen it, please don't spoil the British Open.

1992
02:19:35,680 --> 02:19:37,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay black, Redertainment, Garris.

1993
02:19:37,722 --> 02:19:38,163
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkNightRises.com

1994
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:56,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one question from that movie.

1995
02:19:56,771 --> 02:19:56,991
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1996
02:19:57,371 --> 02:19:59,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did Bane sound Belgian?

1997
02:20:00,272 --> 02:20:02,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it just me or did he sound Belgian?

1998
02:20:02,313 --> 02:20:05,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not think you should talk about his voice in a negative manner.

1999
02:20:05,894 --> 02:20:07,935
[SPEAKER_08]: He sounded like Count Von Count to me.

2000
02:20:08,195 --> 02:20:08,736
[SPEAKER_08]: He sounded Belgian.

2001
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:17,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked his voice, even if it was a little silly.

2002
02:20:18,006 --> 02:20:19,528
[SPEAKER_03]: He sounded very pleasant.

2003
02:20:19,608 --> 02:20:21,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad they changed it from that trailer, though.

2004
02:20:22,772 --> 02:20:24,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in the trailer, Bane sounded like this.

2005
02:20:25,315 --> 02:20:26,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Tom Hardy.

2006
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:35,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Hardy is... I'm just saying this as your resident gay gamer.

2007
02:20:36,023 --> 02:20:36,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just putting this out there.

2008
02:20:36,984 --> 02:20:39,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Hardy is so fucking hot.

2009
02:20:39,386 --> 02:20:40,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I can't even.

2010
02:20:40,686 --> 02:20:41,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even.

2011
02:20:43,533 --> 02:20:45,194
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no Bruce Campbell, I'm sorry.

2012
02:20:45,335 --> 02:20:46,476
[SPEAKER_09]: He wasn't that hot as Bane.

2013
02:20:48,317 --> 02:20:49,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the movie, the movie, can I just say?

2014
02:20:50,679 --> 02:20:52,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't as good as the last one.

2015
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:53,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see the last one.

2016
02:20:53,201 --> 02:20:57,525
[SPEAKER_09]: The Dark Knight will probably be like the best comic book movie they ever freaking make.

2017
02:20:57,785 --> 02:20:58,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Avengers.

2018
02:20:58,506 --> 02:21:01,408
[SPEAKER_09]: But I honestly think Dark Knight was better than Avengers.

2019
02:21:01,428 --> 02:21:03,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong, I love the Avengers, but Dark Knight was off-managing.

2020
02:21:03,930 --> 02:21:04,591
[SPEAKER_09]: DC fails.

2021
02:21:05,832 --> 02:21:08,574
[SPEAKER_09]: This new movie was pretty good, except the...

2022
02:21:10,095 --> 02:21:35,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked Catwoman there was a twist and I was pleasantly surprised with Catwoman Anne Hathaway is a goddess let's just be real Anne Hathaway deserves to have statues built of her the ending twist I should have seen coming because I saw the casting but it still threw me even though I knew there's a couple twists and one of them I saw within like five seconds of the character showing up I'm like oh not that that's the one I probably should have seen coming because I knew better anyway

2023
02:21:38,084 --> 02:21:39,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spoil anything.

2024
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:26,279
[SPEAKER_03]: although after playing for about six hours in between two days I found myself wishing there were more wow-ish things about it oh well I guess all other MMOs were the gateway drug to the ultra drug wow as we know it as a sucker that is on the annual pass plan I guess I'll go roll a new tune and start my adventure all over again just so I don't feel like I'm giving charity money to Blizzard

2025
02:22:27,779 --> 02:22:30,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really hoping something fresh comes from Guild Wars 2.

2026
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:37,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Not being a hater or a troll, but it would be exciting to see a new MMO come out and be the prolific WoW killer.

2027
02:22:37,981 --> 02:22:38,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Your thoughts?

2028
02:22:38,741 --> 02:22:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is from Travis.

2029
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:47,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to use this opportunity to give a cheap plug to the best little Horde house in Azeroth, www.hordehouse.com.

2030
02:22:47,702 --> 02:22:52,763
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the other show that I'm on on VOG Network that debuts Wednesdays here at VOG.

2031
02:22:54,564 --> 02:22:56,584
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say this about World of Warcraft.

2032
02:22:57,624 --> 02:22:59,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've said this many times on Horde House.

2033
02:22:59,367 --> 02:23:04,893
[SPEAKER_09]: The game that will kill World of Warcraft is World of Warcraft.

2034
02:23:05,454 --> 02:23:05,954
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

2035
02:23:06,395 --> 02:23:09,539
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be the thing that kills World of Warcraft is itself.

2036
02:23:09,699 --> 02:23:11,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this is the type of thing that inevitably happens.

2037
02:23:12,222 --> 02:23:13,423
[SPEAKER_09]: What's killing Diablo 3?

2038
02:23:14,785 --> 02:23:15,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Question mark.

2039
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:16,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Itself.

2040
02:23:17,702 --> 02:23:22,105
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the only thing that's going to really kill World of Warcraft is itself.

2041
02:23:22,605 --> 02:23:23,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that that's never going to happen.

2042
02:23:24,166 --> 02:23:26,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the steam's going to run out someday.

2043
02:23:26,928 --> 02:23:43,139
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess maybe I should say instead of itself, I should say Blizzard, because whatever Blizzard's next MMO ends up being will probably be, I mean, as long as they don't make some of the mistakes they made with Diablo 3, which I think is inevitably going to push back Titan or whatever this new MMO ends up being.

2044
02:23:45,140 --> 02:24:12,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it could have a large impact on WoW's user base but I think World of Warcraft is going to be around for a long time to come because so many people have invested so much into it it's just the way it is anyhow that was it well then you should send more emails for next week mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com I want to hear from some of you playstation home folks give us some playstation related questions and so forth

2045
02:24:13,866 --> 02:24:16,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Or here's a serious question for the home people.

2046
02:24:17,428 --> 02:24:19,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that PlayStation Home gets a bad rap?

2047
02:24:19,729 --> 02:24:25,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's a lot of people that don't take home very seriously or don't get home.

2048
02:24:25,072 --> 02:24:29,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to openly admit, we've been kind of those types of skeptics on the show in the past.

2049
02:24:29,394 --> 02:24:33,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, home was kind of plugged as this big...

2050
02:24:34,036 --> 02:24:36,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think your place has gotten a bad rap?

2051
02:24:55,464 --> 02:25:15,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say this the community of course is wonderful and events and things like this and I think home is a lot better now than it was three years ago and there is a lot to unlock in there and fun stuff but you know kind of want to throw that out there I want to hear from some of you at our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com

2052
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:17,340
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2053
02:25:18,722 --> 02:25:26,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And BlackWolf is reporting from live within PlayStation Home that the PlayStation Home folks agree that Avengers was better than Dark Knight.

2054
02:25:27,790 --> 02:25:28,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2055
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:29,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you all.

2056
02:25:29,291 --> 02:25:30,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you all, my children.

2057
02:25:31,673 --> 02:25:33,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean fucking Hawkeye.

2058
02:25:33,174 --> 02:25:34,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Hawkeye.

2059
02:25:35,536 --> 02:25:43,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as I've heard one smaller child say, not Becky's son, but like a seven-year-old, Hawk Guy.

2060
02:25:43,063 --> 02:25:44,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2061
02:25:46,983 --> 02:25:47,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2062
02:25:48,685 --> 02:25:49,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

2063
02:25:49,425 --> 02:25:54,310
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for us to get angsty in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2064
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:56,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do we have a segment called the FUs of the Week?

2065
02:25:57,132 --> 02:25:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we can, FU!

2066
02:26:17,902 --> 02:26:33,674
[SPEAKER_03]: While driving to San Francisco yesterday, I was on this little bit where the carpool lane splits off to sort of bypass the rest of traffic to get to the... just past Emeryville to get to where you pay the tolls.

2067
02:26:34,815 --> 02:26:37,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And some 60-year-old Asian man...

2068
02:26:39,198 --> 02:26:43,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I normally do not support stereotypes, but sometimes they exist for a reason.

2069
02:26:45,861 --> 02:26:52,023
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be something that enabled the stereotype to exist, why it's usually accepted.

2070
02:26:52,283 --> 02:26:53,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, definitely driving while Asian.

2071
02:26:55,124 --> 02:26:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: In his little Mazda MPV.

2072
02:26:58,385 --> 02:27:16,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Decides that he's going to change lanes Right where I am And as Marissa is my witness Because she was sitting there in the back I beat Luckily she had some airbags to protect her I beeped my horn I flicked my lights

2073
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,302
[SPEAKER_03]: and definitely screamed, what the fuck are you doing?

2074
02:27:22,242 --> 02:27:23,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Several times in the car.

2075
02:27:24,344 --> 02:27:25,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And Becky was in the front seat.

2076
02:27:25,825 --> 02:27:27,466
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a mess after.

2077
02:27:28,726 --> 02:27:30,047
[SPEAKER_03]: He ran right into where she was.

2078
02:27:30,227 --> 02:27:31,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, he wasn't going very quickly.

2079
02:27:31,868 --> 02:27:32,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going at speed.

2080
02:27:33,129 --> 02:27:37,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going 65 because of the way traffic was moving.

2081
02:27:37,072 --> 02:27:38,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And some other guy was on my ass.

2082
02:27:38,813 --> 02:27:39,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So I couldn't slow down.

2083
02:27:39,914 --> 02:27:41,715
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no right to merge.

2084
02:27:42,275 --> 02:27:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, he was trying to cross and right where the line was starting to go solid.

2085
02:27:46,898 --> 02:27:52,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving that fast, having a collision that fast, you guys are very, I mean, no matter what, it's lucky.

2086
02:27:52,942 --> 02:27:54,283
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have been like Becky.

2087
02:27:54,303 --> 02:27:55,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have been hysteric.

2088
02:27:56,584 --> 02:27:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been me.

2089
02:27:57,144 --> 02:27:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: She was just tensed up.

2090
02:27:58,245 --> 02:27:59,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, I would have been full on tears.

2091
02:28:00,046 --> 02:28:01,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what happened.

2092
02:28:02,528 --> 02:28:06,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, when I panic, I either cry or scream, and I opted for screaming.

2093
02:28:07,851 --> 02:28:08,672
[SPEAKER_03]: You're very good at it.

2094
02:28:09,472 --> 02:28:09,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Hush.

2095
02:28:10,233 --> 02:28:11,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what happened.

2096
02:28:11,233 --> 02:28:11,894
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically...

2097
02:28:13,414 --> 02:28:20,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, I guess he got defensive enough or something, and I honestly think that he started to pull over when I was in his blind spot.

2098
02:28:21,425 --> 02:28:28,093
[SPEAKER_03]: He knocked my passenger side rearview mirror off, which I'm very pissed off about, because you know I love my car.

2099
02:28:28,674 --> 02:28:31,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Ponte Yoda, the rally vibe, whatever we call it.

2100
02:28:32,652 --> 02:28:34,133
[SPEAKER_03]: and scraped up the side of my car.

2101
02:28:34,173 --> 02:28:35,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not bad damage.

2102
02:28:35,653 --> 02:28:37,654
[SPEAKER_03]: The car drove perfectly fine after that.

2103
02:28:38,375 --> 02:28:42,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um... So we stopped in the little divider, like, right where the lane split.

2104
02:28:43,116 --> 02:28:45,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was... We had room to move around there.

2105
02:28:46,478 --> 02:28:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And... He comes out of his car yelling at me.

2106
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, What the fuck, dude?

2107
02:28:52,660 --> 02:28:53,741
[SPEAKER_03]: You broke my car!

2108
02:28:53,821 --> 02:28:54,941
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have a mirror!

2109
02:28:56,042 --> 02:28:58,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And just... I was like...

2110
02:28:59,123 --> 02:29:28,352
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was like yelling stuff like please speak with some intelligence I can't understand you and his wife was definitely a lot more reasonable than he was and we got it worked out and it's funny we're both through AAA for our insurance so I just had to say oh he's with AAA here's his number because I'm with AAA so I was like oh we've got his record right now I've got photos because I am like that and take photos you've got the digital camera in your glove box I'm sure well on my phone I guess that's true we all do now

2111
02:29:29,247 --> 02:29:31,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And now here's what the stupid thing was.

2112
02:29:31,247 --> 02:29:42,790
[SPEAKER_03]: In his little Mazda MPV, he had mattresses stacked right behind their heads to block his rearview mirror, including blocking his blind spot.

2113
02:29:42,870 --> 02:29:43,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

2114
02:29:44,010 --> 02:29:44,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

2115
02:29:44,490 --> 02:29:47,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is not illegal, but definitely not safe.

2116
02:29:47,571 --> 02:29:48,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And not good for his insurance.

2117
02:29:49,371 --> 02:29:49,551
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2118
02:29:50,312 --> 02:29:51,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have photos of it.

2119
02:29:51,972 --> 02:29:52,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yikes.

2120
02:29:52,352 --> 02:29:54,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm kind of an anal bitch that way.

2121
02:29:55,973 --> 02:29:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um...

2122
02:29:59,194 --> 02:30:02,936
[SPEAKER_03]: The other parts of my FU now go to the California Highway Patrol.

2123
02:30:03,036 --> 02:30:05,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the guy didn't take a report because nobody was injured.

2124
02:30:06,778 --> 02:30:08,499
[SPEAKER_03]: The cars were relatively fine.

2125
02:30:08,539 --> 02:30:17,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't... Well, they can, but at this point, I was just like, fuck it, dude.

2126
02:30:17,324 --> 02:30:18,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hungry, and I'm...

2127
02:30:22,306 --> 02:30:28,951
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how I get when I get on that verge of anxiety where I'm just kind of shaky and don't want to deal with shit?

2128
02:30:29,171 --> 02:30:29,731
[SPEAKER_03]: That was me.

2129
02:30:30,492 --> 02:30:34,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stopped and did some deep breathing.

2130
02:30:35,555 --> 02:30:42,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is funny because we kept seeing people pull over the whole fucking way from Sacramento to San Francisco and back.

2131
02:30:42,899 --> 02:30:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: The highway patrol is everywhere.

2132
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:46,782
[SPEAKER_03]: We wait like 20 minutes for them to show up.

2133
02:30:47,500 --> 02:30:48,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like...

2134
02:30:57,674 --> 02:31:01,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say that my defensive driving is pretty good.

2135
02:31:02,476 --> 02:31:06,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Except the thing is that I couldn't swerve to the side because there was a wall next to me.

2136
02:31:07,198 --> 02:31:11,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would have been worse to run into the wall than have the dude run into me.

2137
02:31:11,699 --> 02:31:14,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to speed up to get around him.

2138
02:31:14,420 --> 02:31:19,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, I honestly think that me speeding up was why the collision wasn't worse.

2139
02:31:19,702 --> 02:31:23,644
[SPEAKER_03]: And his mirror was just like tipped up just a little bit.

2140
02:31:23,664 --> 02:31:24,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tipped up a little bit.

2141
02:31:24,944 --> 02:31:25,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine was gone.

2142
02:31:26,485 --> 02:31:28,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Mine is somewhere in Emeryville right now.

2143
02:31:29,367 --> 02:31:30,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck him.

2144
02:31:32,008 --> 02:31:33,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is the other part of the fuck you.

2145
02:31:33,970 --> 02:31:37,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck everybody on the road who was beeping at us and going, nice job.

2146
02:31:39,493 --> 02:31:41,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't help when I got out of the car either.

2147
02:31:42,779 --> 02:31:44,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep it classy, California.

2148
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:51,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the guys managed to stop, like, slow down just enough for me to go, You get out here and fix it then!

2149
02:31:53,425 --> 02:31:54,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And he rolled up his window.

2150
02:31:57,127 --> 02:31:57,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Bastard.

2151
02:31:58,207 --> 02:32:00,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it when your anger isn't directed at me.

2152
02:32:00,549 --> 02:32:00,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2153
02:32:01,689 --> 02:32:02,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just...

2154
02:32:04,609 --> 02:32:11,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, you know, I don't get... And you know, the lady at Allstate, she was like, Oh, it's always the people who are at fault that do the yelling.

2155
02:32:11,534 --> 02:32:11,875
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean AAA?

2156
02:32:11,915 --> 02:32:12,155
[SPEAKER_09]: AAA.

2157
02:32:12,295 --> 02:32:21,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I called Allstate first because I was so... Well, when I got home, I was still... Every time I looked in my rearview mirror and didn't see it not there, I'd just get pissed again.

2158
02:32:22,042 --> 02:32:24,164
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I get home, I'm so pissed off and shaky.

2159
02:32:24,184 --> 02:32:25,064
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can ask Marissa.

2160
02:32:25,705 --> 02:32:26,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I was pissed off and shaking.

2161
02:32:27,806 --> 02:32:29,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Allstate instead of AAA.

2162
02:32:30,527 --> 02:32:31,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops.

2163
02:32:31,587 --> 02:32:36,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm on the phone with freaking Allstate and they're trying to find information for me.

2164
02:32:36,068 --> 02:32:37,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, wait, I'm with AAA.

2165
02:32:37,308 --> 02:32:37,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang up.

2166
02:32:38,868 --> 02:32:44,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Misty in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, if I find it when I pass through Emeryville next time, I'll get it back for you.

2167
02:32:46,930 --> 02:32:50,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I will share a picture from my Facebook with everyone.

2168
02:32:50,470 --> 02:32:51,011
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki.

2169
02:32:51,031 --> 02:32:52,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you're going to follow that, but good luck.

2170
02:32:52,951 --> 02:32:53,091
[SPEAKER_09]: F you.

2171
02:32:54,206 --> 02:32:59,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, FU2, people that change up tournament rules 15 minutes before the tournament starts.

2172
02:33:00,316 --> 02:33:01,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, that's a little ridiculous.

2173
02:33:02,139 --> 02:33:03,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, I'm patient.

2174
02:33:03,081 --> 02:33:03,822
[SPEAKER_06]: If my wife had it...

2175
02:33:05,717 --> 02:33:07,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be trying to get my money back.

2176
02:33:08,018 --> 02:33:09,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be trying to get money for the gas.

2177
02:33:09,739 --> 02:33:15,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be trying to deface their website and smear them all over the other side.

2178
02:33:15,782 --> 02:33:18,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't want to put that much effort.

2179
02:33:18,883 --> 02:33:20,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God Nelly wasn't in Jamie's car.

2180
02:33:21,304 --> 02:33:22,985
[SPEAKER_03]: You should break off his rearview mirror.

2181
02:33:23,225 --> 02:33:28,847
[SPEAKER_06]: To kind of go a little bit with what Jamie said, people that change lanes without signaling, and there's a lot of them, and

2182
02:33:29,287 --> 02:33:30,628
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy didn't signal either.

2183
02:33:30,909 --> 02:33:34,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I had, you know, it's like, dude, you're like, and they were elderly people.

2184
02:33:35,893 --> 02:33:37,154
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not just elderly people.

2185
02:33:38,956 --> 02:33:40,617
[SPEAKER_03]: In my case, it's elderly Asians.

2186
02:33:41,538 --> 02:33:48,224
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, I mean, and the people that are older, not necessarily elderly, but like at least in their 50s.

2187
02:33:48,704 --> 02:33:50,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, how long have you been fucking driving?

2188
02:33:50,966 --> 02:33:51,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

2189
02:33:51,306 --> 02:33:53,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Is a turn signal like a new thing to you?

2190
02:33:53,188 --> 02:33:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: You just now...

2191
02:33:54,369 --> 02:33:54,689
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2192
02:34:24,434 --> 02:34:25,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll go next.

2193
02:34:25,895 --> 02:34:26,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2194
02:34:26,356 --> 02:34:28,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have any traffic FUs this week.

2195
02:34:28,578 --> 02:34:30,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to break form here, but I will say this.

2196
02:34:31,601 --> 02:34:41,310
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to the fact that I kind of hurt my knee pretty bad last week because in my role that I was playing in Repo the Genetic Opera, I got to die three times as three different cops.

2197
02:34:41,850 --> 02:34:47,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of the times I died, I hit the ground pretty hard and I kind of fucked up my knee doing that.

2198
02:34:47,956 --> 02:34:50,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I should actually wear the knee pads next time, but

2199
02:34:50,678 --> 02:34:54,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't have time when I changed my costume to get them on because they can kind of be a pain in the ass.

2200
02:34:55,043 --> 02:34:56,745
[SPEAKER_09]: So F you to the fact that I fucked up my knee.

2201
02:34:57,806 --> 02:34:58,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, not that music.

2202
02:34:58,707 --> 02:34:59,087
[SPEAKER_09]: This music.

2203
02:34:59,127 --> 02:34:59,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one other thing.

2204
02:35:00,609 --> 02:35:03,752
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the hills in San Francisco and having to walk uphill both ways.

2205
02:35:04,353 --> 02:35:04,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

2206
02:35:04,814 --> 02:35:05,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the snow.

2207
02:35:05,334 --> 02:35:07,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Walking from Japantown to the Castro.

2208
02:35:07,396 --> 02:35:08,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow.

2209
02:35:09,078 --> 02:35:09,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm back.

2210
02:35:09,659 --> 02:35:11,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, if you have any F yous.

2211
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:23,051
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to absolutely shock anyone that loves me and knows me well, but I don't have that much to bitch about right now.

2212
02:35:23,111 --> 02:35:30,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's... Those of you out there in Radio Land that know me are going to be like... But, yeah, F you to that guy on the road.

2213
02:35:30,260 --> 02:35:30,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

2214
02:35:31,651 --> 02:35:32,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from L.A.

2215
02:35:32,172 --> 02:35:37,174
[SPEAKER_09]: where, you know... You can't fucking complain about anything traffic.

2216
02:35:37,775 --> 02:35:38,975
[SPEAKER_09]: People are crazy in L.A.

2217
02:35:38,995 --> 02:35:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just constantly in the upright position on the road out there.

2218
02:35:44,858 --> 02:35:45,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2219
02:35:45,199 --> 02:35:46,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, well, I guess I could say F.U.

2220
02:35:46,499 --> 02:35:50,822
[SPEAKER_04]: to the gentleman I mentioned earlier.

2221
02:35:51,162 --> 02:35:53,923
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't want to... Never mind, because that involves F.U.

2222
02:35:54,303 --> 02:35:57,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So... But, yeah, so... F.U.

2223
02:35:57,785 --> 02:35:58,986
[SPEAKER_04]: to bad drivers, like everybody else.

2224
02:36:01,064 --> 02:36:01,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Well played.

2225
02:36:30,540 --> 02:36:54,491
[SPEAKER_06]: that's that's that's that's ballsy that's safe all right two more stories for you guys then we're going to get to the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR but not just yet because we have a few more stories starting with Loki yes um so one of the games that's being kickstarted right now is actually another Shadowrun game Shadowrun Online and they talked a little bit more details about their game and showed a little bit of gameplay which looks pretty awesome it kind of it's like a

2226
02:36:55,151 --> 02:36:57,013
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2227
02:37:18,753 --> 02:37:45,931
[SPEAKER_06]: and also they're showing some of the different things in there they have a portion of the game where okay you go to these hub worlds and you get your mission and there's a part of the mission that requires you to do the investigation work and the leg work and so if your leg work isn't very good you may not know that hey there's an easier way to get into this you know location in order to get this information or hey this is going to be heavily guarded by something so you'll kind of you know

2228
02:37:47,072 --> 02:37:48,133
[SPEAKER_06]: know a little bit about it.

2229
02:37:50,275 --> 02:37:50,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's kind of cool.

2230
02:37:51,115 --> 02:37:54,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, they're saying that the game at launch is going to retail for $39.99.

2231
02:37:55,459 --> 02:38:01,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, if you back the Kickstarter, you'll get the game at $25 at that donation level.

2232
02:38:02,524 --> 02:38:08,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a new campaign, they're going to be launching every three to four months for $15.

2233
02:38:08,949 --> 02:38:12,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be kind of add-on expansions.

2234
02:38:14,213 --> 02:38:15,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Sound like something you might be putting money down for?

2235
02:38:16,974 --> 02:38:35,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, I mean, I've already backed one Kickstarter Shadowrun game, so I'd be kind of curious, but once again, I don't have time for MMOs, but the game sounds like it's more single player with other people at the same time, kind of, I don't know.

2236
02:38:36,969 --> 02:38:41,173
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play it single player, you can play it co-op, or you can do PvP.

2237
02:38:43,195 --> 02:38:44,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be neat.

2238
02:38:44,096 --> 02:38:45,198
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to see when it comes out.

2239
02:38:45,278 --> 02:38:47,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably not going to back it, though.

2240
02:38:47,740 --> 02:38:50,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I've backed too much stuff recently.

2241
02:38:51,365 --> 02:38:51,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Insert Coin Clothing

2242
02:39:10,328 --> 02:39:12,830
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2243
02:39:35,447 --> 02:39:41,449
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, if you want some Sega clothes, sounds like something of DarkSakura's alley, although it would cost an arm and a leg to import.

2244
02:39:42,229 --> 02:39:45,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you can get a friend in the UK to help you shop at InsertCoinClothing.

2245
02:39:45,110 --> 02:39:46,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Mr. Kidman.

2246
02:39:48,551 --> 02:39:53,013
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, InsertCoinClothing.com if you want more information on that, some of the official Sega clothing.

2247
02:39:53,033 --> 02:39:54,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I fucking want?

2248
02:39:54,413 --> 02:39:57,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, Sega, I don't know if it's official, but Sega-inspired clothing.

2249
02:39:57,794 --> 02:39:59,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want the N7 hoodie.

2250
02:39:59,275 --> 02:40:00,795
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I want is the N7 hoodie.

2251
02:40:00,875 --> 02:40:01,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody get it for me.

2252
02:40:05,137 --> 02:40:08,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm getting a message via BlackWolf from PlayStation Home.

2253
02:40:09,418 --> 02:40:10,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Blender wants to do another contest.

2254
02:40:11,499 --> 02:40:17,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Pick an animal and the first person to type that animal into the home space wins another prize in home.

2255
02:40:17,920 --> 02:40:18,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So an animal.

2256
02:40:19,461 --> 02:40:20,861
[SPEAKER_09]: What animal are we going to pick?

2257
02:40:21,161 --> 02:40:22,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we go obvious?

2258
02:40:23,742 --> 02:40:25,563
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, why don't you pick for us?

2259
02:40:26,163 --> 02:40:28,684
[SPEAKER_09]: What animal do you think they should type in the home chat?

2260
02:40:30,664 --> 02:40:31,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell them that though.

2261
02:40:31,645 --> 02:40:32,505
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to guess, right?

2262
02:40:33,394 --> 02:41:02,531

[SPEAKER_09]: Let us know who wins, Bobby.

2264
02:41:22,702 --> 02:41:28,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and remember... Marissa goes, animal in the sack!

2265
02:41:31,128 --> 02:41:36,551
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all I hear from people that play Mass Effect, so... Remember... No, it's Caden for me.

2266
02:41:37,532 --> 02:41:39,793
[SPEAKER_09]: If you talk to the gays, they'll all say, Caden!

2267
02:41:41,715 --> 02:41:57,665
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm like Kate is an ass who actually his model is like the guy he's modeled after and who did all the face cap and stuff actually is like a gay bartender from the Abbey and he's hot I gotta admit he was easy on the eyes

2268
02:41:58,986 --> 02:41:59,266
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2269
02:41:59,586 --> 02:42:00,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Skull King won.

2270
02:42:00,626 --> 02:42:01,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course he did.

2271
02:42:01,807 --> 02:42:02,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course he won.

2272
02:42:03,547 --> 02:42:03,827
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2273
02:42:03,847 --> 02:42:04,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

2274
02:42:04,547 --> 02:42:11,269
[SPEAKER_09]: He deserves it for helping support the VOG participation with Summerfest.

2275
02:42:11,289 --> 02:42:14,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Lemurs, lemurs, cutie furry lemurs.

2276
02:42:14,530 --> 02:42:14,810
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2277
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:17,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on to the Skyplane.

2278
02:42:17,891 --> 02:42:19,391
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got to open that up.

2279
02:42:19,411 --> 02:42:20,051
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2280
02:42:20,091 --> 02:42:24,452
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skyplane is open right now for you guys to give us a call.

2281
02:42:25,273 --> 02:42:26,853
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to call us from PlayStation Home...

2282
02:42:27,273 --> 02:42:27,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2283
02:42:27,734 --> 02:42:30,756
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're one of our regular listeners who wants to call us, that's awesome too.

2284
02:42:31,356 --> 02:42:34,359
[SPEAKER_09]: We will talk to you at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2285
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:37,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, let me get to some Twitter topics.

2286
02:42:37,361 --> 02:42:39,483
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a few things that were sent to us via Twitter.

2287
02:42:39,983 --> 02:42:44,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to look at this from Tigerclaw because this tweet here from Tigerclaw just jumps out at me.

2288
02:42:44,707 --> 02:42:45,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, what?

2289
02:42:46,929 --> 02:42:52,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Irrational Games Job lists 85 plus Metacritic score as a requirement.

2290
02:42:54,363 --> 02:42:57,265
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the developer of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite.

2291
02:42:57,325 --> 02:42:58,346
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Irrational Games.

2292
02:42:58,686 --> 02:43:08,753
[SPEAKER_09]: They posted a job listing for a design manager, and apparently one of their resume or whatever has to have a past work that has a high score on Metacritic.

2293
02:43:08,773 --> 02:43:09,013
[SPEAKER_09]: That's...

2294
02:43:10,074 --> 02:43:10,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of surprising.

2295
02:43:10,934 --> 02:43:13,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's posted on the Gamasutra job boards.

2296
02:43:13,495 --> 02:43:17,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Credit on at least one game with an 85-plus average Metacritic review score.

2297
02:43:19,697 --> 02:43:28,460
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you feel about Metacritic's score having such weight, especially when you consider the games like Child of Eden got an 84, Mirror's Edge got an 81?

2298
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:29,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2299
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:34,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that whole controversy over Fallout New Vegas and the bonus they didn't get because it was an 84?

2300
02:43:34,802 --> 02:43:34,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm.

2301
02:43:39,304 --> 02:43:44,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what's the job requirement is that they've had to publish or worked on a game that received a Metacritic over 85?

2302
02:43:44,887 --> 02:43:45,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

2303
02:43:46,427 --> 02:43:47,428
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to have some credit.

2304
02:43:47,528 --> 02:43:48,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, let's go to the phones.

2305
02:43:48,728 --> 02:44:03,415
[SPEAKER_06]: What if, like, their co-worker Bob just really bombed when it came to, like, you know, it's like, yeah, we did all this really good work, but man, he just, like, he just made fart noises into a microphone for all the dialogue in the game, and it just really hurt us.

2306
02:44:04,896 --> 02:44:05,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2307
02:44:05,796 --> 02:44:06,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

2308
02:44:06,717 --> 02:44:07,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2309
02:44:08,218 --> 02:44:08,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, it's Oscar.

2310
02:44:09,318 --> 02:44:11,000
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2311
02:44:29,907 --> 02:44:33,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, you drove 12 hours to see the Zelda Symphony.

2312
02:44:34,029 --> 02:44:36,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I went to... It was well worth it.

2313
02:44:36,570 --> 02:44:40,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to LA to see the Dear Friends concert, so yeah, it's about the same.

2314
02:44:41,172 --> 02:44:41,752
[SPEAKER_09]: It was worth it?

2315
02:44:42,472 --> 02:44:43,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, definitely.

2316
02:44:43,472 --> 02:44:44,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us a little bit about the experience.

2317
02:44:45,993 --> 02:44:51,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't know, did any of you guys buy Skyward Sword and see how they had the orchestra CD packaged in with the game?

2318
02:44:51,536 --> 02:44:52,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, no.

2319
02:44:52,556 --> 02:44:54,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I never got around to that one, sadly.

2320
02:44:55,287 --> 02:45:04,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, like, it has, like, seven or eight or so tracks on that CD, and it's... They played pretty much most of those, but there were so much more.

2321
02:45:04,533 --> 02:45:07,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, they had complete, like, symphonic movements in each of the game.

2322
02:45:07,335 --> 02:45:19,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, there was Ocarina of Time movement, a Twilight Princess movement, a movement from Link to the Past, and, oh my god, the friggin' Link to the Past one, like, I teared up at one part where they did the credits music, because I just forgot about that.

2323
02:45:21,103 --> 02:45:22,064
[SPEAKER_09]: That game is so good.

2324
02:45:23,305 --> 02:45:23,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2325
02:45:23,545 --> 02:45:23,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2326
02:45:24,697 --> 02:45:28,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong, Ocarina of Time is my favorite, but that game has some moments.

2327
02:45:29,162 --> 02:45:31,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2328
02:45:31,665 --> 02:45:32,687
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't just go by yourself.

2329
02:45:32,727 --> 02:45:33,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine you went with friends.

2330
02:45:34,649 --> 02:45:36,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I had a couple friends with me that went.

2331
02:45:37,973 --> 02:45:41,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it was one of my friends who posted on Facebook, I'm buying tickets today.

2332
02:45:41,497 --> 02:45:42,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Who wants to go?

2333
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:43,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I was one of the first people to respond.

2334
02:45:45,185 --> 02:45:49,108
[SPEAKER_10]: So he bought my ticket, which was only $65 for that theater.

2335
02:45:49,128 --> 02:45:51,370
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like the Wolf Trap Theater near D.C.

2336
02:45:53,112 --> 02:45:54,733
[SPEAKER_10]: They were really good seats, actually.

2337
02:45:55,574 --> 02:45:56,334
[SPEAKER_10]: They were pretty close.

2338
02:45:57,015 --> 02:45:58,296
[SPEAKER_09]: So you drove from where?

2339
02:45:58,817 --> 02:45:59,597
[SPEAKER_09]: You live in Ohio?

2340
02:46:00,058 --> 02:46:00,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Michigan?

2341
02:46:01,078 --> 02:46:08,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, I live in Northeast Ohio, but my friend who bought the tickets lives down in Athens, Ohio, which is like the southeastern portion of it.

2342
02:46:09,205 --> 02:46:09,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

2343
02:46:11,264 --> 02:46:15,926
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to go down there anyway to move stuff out of my apartment for the next year.

2344
02:46:17,126 --> 02:46:21,268
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was no big deal driving down there myself, but then he drove to D.C.

2345
02:46:21,388 --> 02:46:21,988
[SPEAKER_10]: for the most part.

2346
02:46:22,609 --> 02:46:24,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's a long drive.

2347
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:26,070
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's awesome.

2348
02:46:26,130 --> 02:46:28,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it sounds like it was quite the experience.

2349
02:46:28,311 --> 02:46:29,291
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the crowd like?

2350
02:46:32,533 --> 02:46:33,793
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a mixed bag.

2351
02:46:34,153 --> 02:46:40,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was going to be a lot of kids, but actually it was only a few and a lot of teenagers to adults.

2352
02:46:41,121 --> 02:46:46,127
[SPEAKER_10]: and, like, the kids that were there, like, I saw their dads that were with them all had their 3DSs out.

2353
02:46:46,147 --> 02:46:47,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it was just a street pass fest.

2354
02:46:47,929 --> 02:46:49,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, just non-stop.

2355
02:46:49,471 --> 02:46:51,914
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably got 100 during the course of the day.

2356
02:46:52,115 --> 02:46:56,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my, yeah, you probably could have beat Find Me in one sitting there.

2357
02:46:56,920 --> 02:46:57,541
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

2358
02:46:58,162 --> 02:46:58,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, definitely.

2359
02:46:59,223 --> 02:46:59,464
[SPEAKER_10]: It was...

2360
02:47:00,956 --> 02:47:01,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2361
02:47:01,436 --> 02:47:02,836
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to go.

2362
02:47:02,896 --> 02:47:03,497
[SPEAKER_10]: You really should.

2363
02:47:03,597 --> 02:47:05,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I do if they come back through here.

2364
02:47:05,757 --> 02:47:08,458
[SPEAKER_10]: The last concert is in San Jose on December 14th.

2365
02:47:08,538 --> 02:47:10,018
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can try to make that one.

2366
02:47:10,138 --> 02:47:10,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it?

2367
02:47:11,078 --> 02:47:12,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I might just do that actually.

2368
02:47:12,838 --> 02:47:14,559
[SPEAKER_09]: What day of the week is December 14th?

2369
02:47:14,599 --> 02:47:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2370
02:47:14,899 --> 02:47:17,359
[SPEAKER_09]: The 6th is Umlaut and that's a Thursday.

2371
02:47:17,379 --> 02:47:19,380
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like it would be a Wednesday.

2372
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:20,120
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a Friday.

2373
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:22,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

2374
02:47:22,380 --> 02:47:24,121
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

2375
02:47:24,141 --> 02:47:29,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Go to Zelda-Symphony.com and there should be a link to the schedule up there and you can check it all out.

2376
02:47:29,342 --> 02:47:30,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone want to go?

2377
02:47:30,482 --> 02:47:30,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone?

2378
02:47:30,922 --> 02:47:31,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone?

2379
02:47:31,402 --> 02:47:31,642
Anyone?

2380
02:47:31,823 --> 02:47:32,103
Maybe?

2381
02:47:32,243 --> 02:47:32,883
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll see.

2382
02:47:32,943 --> 02:47:34,784
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll find... Maybe Alan will want to go.

2383
02:47:35,425 --> 02:47:36,085
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make it a trip.

2384
02:47:36,125 --> 02:47:36,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

2385
02:47:36,485 --> 02:47:37,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I have friends in San Jose, too.

2386
02:47:38,186 --> 02:47:46,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Mel and Mel live there, and you know them from this show, and it'll be cool to go see something like that, so... Yeah, well, thanks for the tip, and I'm glad to hear you had a good time.

2387
02:47:47,712 --> 02:47:49,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just hope that they release, like...

2388
02:47:50,305 --> 02:48:04,124
[SPEAKER_10]: another orchestrated CD like maybe after the tour is done because some of those songs I just really want to hear again I'm sure there'll be another Zelda pre-order disc in the future yeah there has to be alright well Osfer I'm going to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call okay

2389
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:07,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, no problem.

2390
02:48:07,760 --> 02:48:08,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty.

2391
02:48:08,101 --> 02:48:12,563
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2392
02:48:13,664 --> 02:48:15,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Meanwhile, some other tweets.

2393
02:48:16,005 --> 02:48:17,085
[SPEAKER_09]: One more from Tiger Claw.

2394
02:48:17,286 --> 02:48:18,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I let people have two tweets.

2395
02:48:19,147 --> 02:48:20,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of a quick headline here.

2396
02:48:20,787 --> 02:48:25,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft halts further development on what was to be the free-to-play game Flight.

2397
02:48:26,310 --> 02:48:30,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It was supposed to be a free-to-play entry in Microsoft's Flight Simulator franchise.

2398
02:48:31,293 --> 02:48:34,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if that has to do with the Vancouver layoffs we heard about earlier.

2399
02:48:34,115 --> 02:48:34,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, look at...

2400
02:48:35,478 --> 02:48:38,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

2401
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:45,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked the flight simulator games back in the day, but I mean, they're so intricate now, like I don't actually know how to fly a plane, people.

2402
02:48:46,224 --> 02:48:46,845
[SPEAKER_09]: But it looked fun.

2403
02:48:47,525 --> 02:48:47,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And pretty.

2404
02:48:48,085 --> 02:48:52,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember those used to be like the high-end graphic games or the flight simulator games.

2405
02:48:53,008 --> 02:48:53,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Marissa?

2406
02:48:53,508 --> 02:48:57,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, if you really wanted to make them properly accurate, you need to have bitchy flight attendants.

2407
02:48:57,251 --> 02:49:00,152
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a real flight simulator.

2408
02:49:00,452 --> 02:49:01,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to join the Mile High Club.

2409
02:49:01,913 --> 02:49:03,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, bathrooms.

2410
02:49:03,988 --> 02:49:05,308
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we got another phone call.

2411
02:49:05,348 --> 02:49:06,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2412
02:49:06,309 --> 02:49:06,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2413
02:49:07,549 --> 02:49:08,069
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Shane.

2414
02:49:08,229 --> 02:49:08,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

2415
02:49:08,409 --> 02:49:10,550
[SPEAKER_11]: With a very bad voice right now because I'm Flemmy.

2416
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:11,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Flemmy.

2417
02:49:11,770 --> 02:49:12,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for sharing.

2418
02:49:12,790 --> 02:49:13,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Flemmy.

2419
02:49:13,390 --> 02:49:14,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

2420
02:49:14,271 --> 02:49:15,331
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's on your mind tonight?

2421
02:49:16,771 --> 02:49:19,372
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation All-Stars thingy-majigger.

2422
02:49:19,452 --> 02:49:20,212
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

2423
02:49:20,252 --> 02:49:22,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're about to violate every NDA in the world.

2424
02:49:22,953 --> 02:49:24,053
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not my NDA.

2425
02:49:24,253 --> 02:49:25,393
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my friend's NDA.

2426
02:49:25,513 --> 02:49:26,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm violating his NDA.

2427
02:49:27,354 --> 02:49:28,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds very dirty.

2428
02:49:28,214 --> 02:49:30,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically, by letting you play, he's already violated the NDA.

2429
02:49:30,875 --> 02:49:31,435
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2430
02:49:32,475 --> 02:49:34,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not giving out his PSN.

2431
02:49:35,036 --> 02:49:36,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not giving out my PSN name.

2432
02:49:36,596 --> 02:49:38,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So go tie it back to me, Sony.

2433
02:49:38,917 --> 02:49:39,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Go.

2434
02:49:39,637 --> 02:49:42,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wouldn't throw down a challenge like that, actually.

2435
02:49:42,538 --> 02:49:44,059
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a joke.

2436
02:49:44,259 --> 02:49:45,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony, please don't.

2437
02:49:45,739 --> 02:49:47,600
[SPEAKER_09]: You have allegedly played the beta.

2438
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:49,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, allegedly.

2439
02:49:49,381 --> 02:49:53,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So why don't you give us allegedly your thoughts?

2440
02:49:54,405 --> 02:50:01,932
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now, the beta that I allegedly played very much feels like a lifeless Smash Bros.

2441
02:50:01,972 --> 02:50:10,680
[SPEAKER_11]: clone, which, you know, not terrible, I guess, but it's not really fun yet, which I think games are supposed to be fun, last I heard.

2442
02:50:10,780 --> 02:50:11,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Why wasn't it fun?

2443
02:50:12,942 --> 02:50:13,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

2444
02:50:14,235 --> 02:50:14,976
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2445
02:50:35,572 --> 02:50:38,514
[SPEAKER_11]: You were telling me that the beta is only multiplayer, correct?

2446
02:50:38,554 --> 02:50:40,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have to connect to somebody else.

2447
02:50:40,656 --> 02:50:42,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't play against computer players.

2448
02:50:42,617 --> 02:50:50,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I have not tried to see if I could play two people on the same console, but part of the problem in the beta right now is when you play Smash Bros.

2449
02:50:50,504 --> 02:50:57,689
[SPEAKER_11]: and you get every person in a tight area, the camera zooms in, it doesn't do that well in this game.

2450
02:50:57,789 --> 02:51:05,235
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't matter how close you are to the action, your character is still really far away and it can make it very hard to figure out what's going on at any given time.

2451
02:51:05,495 --> 02:51:10,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that might have hurt your impressions a little bit, though, the fact you couldn't fuck around in single player at all?

2452
02:51:12,598 --> 02:51:20,001
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because ideally that style of game is just really multiplayer-based, I feel like.

2453
02:51:20,041 --> 02:51:20,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Smash Bros.

2454
02:51:20,601 --> 02:51:22,582
[SPEAKER_11]: isn't fun by yourself at all.

2455
02:51:22,802 --> 02:51:30,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's be real though, being able to play online multiplayer is a feature that Smash Bros., I guess the one on the Wii had it, but it didn't do it very well.

2456
02:51:31,011 --> 02:51:31,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't really do it very well.

2457
02:51:32,553 --> 02:51:33,815
[SPEAKER_09]: But to Smash Bros.

2458
02:51:33,875 --> 02:51:36,498
[SPEAKER_09]: credit, and I'm not like you, I like the Smash Bros.

2459
02:51:36,538 --> 02:51:37,278
[SPEAKER_09]: games a lot.

2460
02:51:37,659 --> 02:51:40,382
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they're bad games, I just think they're overrated.

2461
02:51:40,642 --> 02:51:41,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say that.

2462
02:51:41,603 --> 02:51:43,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing, what I always loved about Smash Bros.

2463
02:51:43,806 --> 02:51:46,510
[SPEAKER_09]: is that they're very robust packages.

2464
02:51:46,970 --> 02:51:51,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, there is so much, especially those most recent Smash Bros.

2465
02:51:51,396 --> 02:51:57,044
[SPEAKER_09]: games, so many unlocks, so many other modes, so many mini-games and other things to experience.

2466
02:51:57,664 --> 02:52:17,948
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot of that was brought into Kid Icarus too so I think the projects that that team does tend to be very robust experiences and I think if Sony doesn't offer fans that same really rich experience which you're not going to see in such a limited beta I think you are going to feel shortchanged a little bit.

2467
02:52:18,598 --> 02:52:48,230
[SPEAKER_11]: well and then one of the things I feel like they really get right are the stages I really like the fact that they change and kind of mix up different games in one stage like I was playing a god of no I was playing the Ratchet and Clank stage and all of a sudden it turned into God of War which is really cool and then one turned into like Patapon I don't remember which stage it also was but I really enjoyed that feature I just after now I didn't know about that leaked list of characters

2468
02:52:48,850 --> 02:52:50,851
[SPEAKER_11]: that people had data mined from the beta.

2469
02:52:51,372 --> 02:52:56,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of sad that there aren't those real robust options that Smash Bros.

2470
02:52:56,995 --> 02:52:57,295
[SPEAKER_11]: offers.

2471
02:52:57,656 --> 02:53:03,779
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will probably get it because I love that Dante and I will play as him even if he's a terrible character.

2472
02:53:04,360 --> 02:53:08,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So despite everything you just said about not feeling super great about it, you're going to buy it anyway.

2473
02:53:09,203 --> 02:53:11,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're adding that Dante that's really, really hot.

2474
02:53:12,104 --> 02:53:14,466
[SPEAKER_11]: It was good enough to make you want to buy it in the end.

2475
02:53:15,276 --> 02:53:15,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2476
02:53:15,736 --> 02:53:16,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think it has potential.

2477
02:53:17,057 --> 02:53:26,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, I'm not judging really purchasing it based on the beta because you can tell that the beta, whatever build they're using, is really early on.

2478
02:53:26,902 --> 02:53:27,122
[SPEAKER_11]: Allegedly.

2479
02:53:27,142 --> 02:53:30,764
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of, like, barren features in it.

2480
02:53:30,864 --> 02:53:31,145
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

2481
02:53:32,105 --> 02:53:32,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2482
02:53:32,845 --> 02:53:37,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to hate the game yet, but it still needs to do more to wow me.

2483
02:53:38,008 --> 02:53:40,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they can pull it off, though.

2484
02:53:40,750 --> 02:53:42,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see what happens in the coming months.

2485
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:47,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully there's a lot of good stuff to be unlocked and things we haven't seen yet and some of these characters in the leak.

2486
02:53:47,854 --> 02:53:59,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Sound Potential, which, by the way, I think Shane coming on here and giving his alleged thoughts on a beta he may have allegedly played is a whole lot less of an infraction than whoever hacked the damn files to pull out those unlockable characters.

2487
02:53:59,541 --> 02:54:01,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and they had pictures of the stages too.

2488
02:54:01,802 --> 02:54:03,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of thought those stages were neat.

2489
02:54:04,264 --> 02:54:07,927
[SPEAKER_04]: As a legal secretary, I approve of your legalese ass covering.

2490
02:54:09,289 --> 02:54:10,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, I appreciate that.

2491
02:54:11,692 --> 02:54:14,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need to hire Marissa as a consultant for other shows in the future.

2492
02:54:15,476 --> 02:54:16,016
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be amazing.

2493
02:54:16,036 --> 02:54:17,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and Frapp is awesome in it.

2494
02:54:17,598 --> 02:54:19,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, he's really cool.

2495
02:54:19,980 --> 02:54:20,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you get to actually rap?

2496
02:54:22,060 --> 02:54:22,882
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but okay.

2497
02:54:23,423 --> 02:54:26,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember that stupid boombox from the game?

2498
02:54:26,949 --> 02:54:27,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2499
02:54:27,730 --> 02:54:29,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you get to throw him around.

2500
02:54:29,633 --> 02:54:31,677
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like that because I hate that boombox.

2501
02:54:32,098 --> 02:54:34,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a stage that's you waiting to use the toilet?

2502
02:54:36,073 --> 02:54:37,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Not in the beta, at least.

2503
02:54:58,829 --> 02:55:02,051
[SPEAKER_11]: They should do another Umjam or Lammy because that game was amazing.

2504
02:55:02,091 --> 02:55:02,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I'll take that.

2505
02:55:03,091 --> 02:55:04,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Umjam or Lammy is pretty fucking good.

2506
02:55:05,072 --> 02:55:06,693
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sad that she's not a leaked character.

2507
02:55:06,733 --> 02:55:08,033
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be really cool.

2508
02:55:08,473 --> 02:55:11,175
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always DLC.

2509
02:55:11,695 --> 02:55:13,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I will buy Umjam or Lammy DLC.

2510
02:55:14,036 --> 02:55:20,879
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could get the one stage that everybody except for me hates as a stage you can play in the game, I would be so excited.

2511
02:55:21,499 --> 02:55:22,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is the hell stage.

2512
02:55:23,180 --> 02:55:28,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Shane, before I let you go, we have a question for you from PlayStation Home Summerfest coming in.

2513
02:55:29,202 --> 02:55:32,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwolf in PlayStation Home says, where is your Rhythm Thief review?

2514
02:55:35,763 --> 02:55:36,464
[SPEAKER_09]: In written form.

2515
02:55:36,624 --> 02:55:37,284
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

2516
02:55:37,344 --> 02:55:38,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't spoil it here.

2517
02:55:38,104 --> 02:55:39,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I want it in written form.

2518
02:55:39,204 --> 02:55:39,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So does Bobby.

2519
02:55:39,744 --> 02:55:40,685
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.

2520
02:55:40,705 --> 02:55:42,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to spoil my review.

2521
02:55:42,745 --> 02:55:43,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

2522
02:55:43,846 --> 02:55:45,266
[SPEAKER_11]: My 3DS is busted.

2523
02:55:45,746 --> 02:55:47,508
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

2524
02:55:47,788 --> 02:55:48,449
[SPEAKER_11]: What'd you do to it?

2525
02:55:48,489 --> 02:55:53,135
[SPEAKER_11]: For some reason, when I hit the B button, it turns off, which is usually the function of the off button.

2526
02:55:55,037 --> 02:55:56,739
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't say.

2527
02:55:57,379 --> 02:56:00,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear Alan laughing at what you just said all the way from the kitchen.

2528
02:56:02,401 --> 02:56:02,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

2529
02:56:02,701 --> 02:56:03,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

2530
02:56:03,481 --> 02:56:05,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the B button is... Never mind.

2531
02:56:05,642 --> 02:56:06,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Forget it.

2532
02:56:06,582 --> 02:56:08,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you've got a short, is what it sounds like.

2533
02:56:08,763 --> 02:56:09,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it does.

2534
02:56:09,844 --> 02:56:11,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes when I hold it funny, it turns off.

2535
02:56:11,564 --> 02:56:12,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, whatever.

2536
02:56:12,284 --> 02:56:13,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't even want to play you.

2537
02:56:13,645 --> 02:56:15,565
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something inside there.

2538
02:56:16,326 --> 02:56:19,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I couldn't find a screwdriver to open it up because I would open it up and try to pick it up.

2539
02:56:19,447 --> 02:56:21,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, yes, you did spill something on your 3DS?

2540
02:56:21,287 --> 02:56:21,667
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

2541
02:56:21,687 --> 02:56:22,308
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't spill anything.

2542
02:56:22,328 --> 02:56:22,788
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no.

2543
02:56:23,488 --> 02:56:27,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I will probably be getting an XL in two weeks thanks to my job so I'll start playing it again

2544
02:56:38,813 --> 02:56:54,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Which we can't talk about any further on the show, but I will talk to the other hosts about it off air It's like the 3DS, but bigger Alright, moving on, I guess that's it So when you get your 3DS situation figured out, we want the review Now that it's not timely

2545
02:56:57,922 --> 02:56:58,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Not my fault.

2546
02:56:58,882 --> 02:57:00,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even play Pokemon.

2547
02:57:00,122 --> 02:57:02,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what a pain that is to me?

2548
02:57:02,623 --> 02:57:04,663
[SPEAKER_09]: We really need more written content at VOG.

2549
02:57:04,703 --> 02:57:06,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And granted, I'm responsible for this too.

2550
02:57:06,644 --> 02:57:09,604
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I've just had so much going on this week.

2551
02:57:10,065 --> 02:57:14,845
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, if you have some time and you're interested in writing for VOG, and it doesn't have to be about video games.

2552
02:57:14,906 --> 02:57:17,526
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be anything, geeky, movies, books.

2553
02:57:17,666 --> 02:57:22,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love somebody who reads a lot of books and even comic books and manga.

2554
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:24,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a book, Rob.

2555
02:57:24,509 --> 02:57:27,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought one of the Vampire Hunter D novels that I hadn't read yet.

2556
02:57:27,512 --> 02:57:28,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it have to be geeky books?

2557
02:57:28,793 --> 02:57:30,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my wife reads a lot of books.

2558
02:57:31,495 --> 02:57:32,897
[SPEAKER_06]: She does read a lot of geeky books.

2559
02:57:33,157 --> 02:57:35,739
[SPEAKER_06]: She reads a lot of... You know what?

2560
02:57:35,939 --> 02:57:37,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Your wife is hilarious, so yes.

2561
02:57:38,001 --> 02:57:38,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care what it is.

2562
02:57:38,922 --> 02:57:39,663
[SPEAKER_09]: She should do book reviews.

2563
02:57:39,783 --> 02:57:39,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll...

2564
02:57:40,263 --> 02:57:40,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll ask.

2565
02:57:41,064 --> 02:57:42,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say this, funny enough.

2566
02:57:42,545 --> 02:57:47,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of book reviews, I actually am doing one for a friend site of VOG's.

2567
02:57:47,988 --> 02:57:49,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not done with the book yet.

2568
02:57:49,649 --> 02:57:51,771
[SPEAKER_09]: But it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out who.

2569
02:57:52,151 --> 02:57:53,652
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm hoping to have that done within the next week.

2570
02:57:53,692 --> 02:57:55,193
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Fifty Shades of Grey.

2571
02:57:55,733 --> 02:57:57,574
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not Fifty Shades of Grey.

2572
02:57:58,495 --> 02:57:59,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you need to redo your review.

2573
02:57:59,596 --> 02:58:01,277
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like Fifty Shades of Shit.

2574
02:58:01,597 --> 02:58:03,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Fifty Shades of I'm Hanging Up on You.

2575
02:58:03,478 --> 02:58:03,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2576
02:58:04,339 --> 02:58:04,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2577
02:58:05,299 --> 02:58:05,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2578
02:58:08,671 --> 02:58:08,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Lordy.

2579
02:58:08,991 --> 02:58:09,892
[SPEAKER_09]: How about one more call?

2580
02:58:10,272 --> 02:58:11,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he mentioned Mass Effect at all.

2581
02:58:13,515 --> 02:58:13,935
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't.

2582
02:58:15,116 --> 02:58:15,836
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

2583
02:58:16,857 --> 02:58:17,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha, Shane.

2584
02:58:19,218 --> 02:58:20,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2585
02:58:20,259 --> 02:58:20,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2586
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:23,181
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Azoramay.

2587
02:58:23,881 --> 02:58:24,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Say that one more time.

2588
02:58:25,683 --> 02:58:26,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Azoramay.

2589
02:58:26,643 --> 02:58:27,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Azoramay.

2590
02:58:27,344 --> 02:58:28,164
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind tonight?

2591
02:58:29,825 --> 02:58:34,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to... I just noticed that there's going to be a Final Fantasy XI revival of music...

2592
02:58:38,427 --> 02:58:41,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Concerts going on in your area, and I want to be aware of that.

2593
02:58:41,588 --> 02:59:09,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I am very aware of that and I kind of sort of want to go actually it's just about you know if I can convince somebody else to go with me so I don't have to go by myself but yeah it's in Berkeley they're doing like a Final Fantasy 11 you know what's funny when I signed back up for the game about a month ago like I got those emails right away and then that's the log on message I don't know if everybody sees that or I just see it because I'm in the area but when I log into the game it says don't forget we have tickets on sale now for the Final Fantasy 11 event in Berkeley so

2594
02:59:10,479 --> 02:59:16,145
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so funny, because I'm a fan of it, but I haven't really lied on it for a while.

2595
02:59:16,325 --> 02:59:31,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I got a letter via email about it, and I was really thinking about going, but I'm on the East Coast in New York, and I actually went to go see the Distant Worlds at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and it was really great.

2596
02:59:31,761 --> 02:59:37,645
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, you have the same problem as you do, trying to convince friends to actually go ahead and see it.

2597
02:59:37,745 --> 02:59:40,628
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

2598
02:59:41,755 --> 02:59:46,019
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, would you think they're going to bring it out here at all?

2599
02:59:46,099 --> 02:59:48,501
[SPEAKER_09]: It really depends on this first one and if it does well.

2600
02:59:48,541 --> 02:59:49,442
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of the deal.

2601
02:59:49,502 --> 02:59:51,383
[SPEAKER_09]: If it makes money, it'll tour.

2602
02:59:51,443 --> 02:59:53,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's something else to consider.

2603
02:59:54,906 --> 02:59:59,810
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going back years and years, so you can't really judge what's going on at Square now to these standards.

2604
03:00:00,271 --> 03:00:03,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But when that first Dear Friends concert happened, which was what?

2605
03:00:03,193 --> 03:00:04,414
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the first year I went to E3.

2606
03:00:04,434 --> 03:00:05,776
[SPEAKER_09]: That was what, 2004, I think?

2607
03:00:05,796 --> 03:00:05,956
[SPEAKER_09]: 2004 or 2005?

2608
03:00:06,036 --> 03:00:06,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It was 2004.

2609
03:00:07,657 --> 03:00:08,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it was 04

2610
03:00:31,033 --> 03:00:37,359
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the next year they did a new show called More Friends that was at the Gibson Amphitheater, I think at Universal Studios.

2611
03:00:37,980 --> 03:00:40,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And I went to that as well because I loved the first one so much.

2612
03:00:40,923 --> 03:00:43,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And More Friends wasn't good.

2613
03:00:43,941 --> 03:00:48,206
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to fault the musicians.

2614
03:00:48,326 --> 03:00:49,768
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to fault the guest stars.

2615
03:00:49,848 --> 03:00:51,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to fault the talent behind it.

2616
03:00:52,051 --> 03:00:55,535
[SPEAKER_09]: But just the production of it was really not good.

2617
03:00:55,635 --> 03:01:00,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of that was acoustic problems and a lot of the sound problems.

2618
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:01,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a lot of live issues.

2619
03:01:01,581 --> 03:01:02,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And I heard...

2620
03:01:03,103 --> 03:01:03,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

2621
03:01:03,323 --> 03:01:03,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, I didn't know that.

2622
03:01:16,627 --> 03:01:18,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a once in a lifetime.

2623
03:01:18,468 --> 03:01:23,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a once in like a... Yes, I can say it was a once in a lifetime event that I got to go to.

2624
03:01:23,771 --> 03:01:26,373
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do consider myself lucky even though it was a bad show.

2625
03:01:26,773 --> 03:01:29,415
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually had like the... And I forget her name.

2626
03:01:29,455 --> 03:01:30,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you know it.

2627
03:01:30,315 --> 03:01:36,279
[SPEAKER_09]: The lady from Final Fantasy X who sang that... I can't remember the name of the song.

2628
03:01:36,299 --> 03:01:36,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

2629
03:01:36,639 --> 03:01:37,679
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't say it.

2630
03:01:37,779 --> 03:01:38,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2631
03:01:39,360 --> 03:02:06,567
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah, she was there singing it and so to hear that live was really amazing but that's, you know and so I'm thankful for moments like that but I realize, you know overall, unfortunately, the show was not a success oh, okay well, I mean, that's kind of like all I really had to really ask hey, no, it's a great question I'm tempted I will say I'm very, very tempted we'll see, I'll let you know what I end up deciding

2632
03:02:07,529 --> 03:02:08,129
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.

2633
03:02:08,389 --> 03:02:09,030
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care.

2634
03:02:09,070 --> 03:02:10,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.

2635
03:02:10,590 --> 03:02:10,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, guy.

2636
03:02:11,811 --> 03:02:13,291
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you so much for the call tonight.

2637
03:02:13,311 --> 03:02:19,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you have a comment you want us to read on a future show.

2638
03:02:19,814 --> 03:02:27,717
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when he phrases it that way, he says it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I do have to realize it might not be totally my backyard.

2639
03:02:28,337 --> 03:02:30,939
[SPEAKER_09]: But Extifer lives in Oakland, Berkeley now.

2640
03:02:30,979 --> 03:02:34,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I could totally go stay with him for a night and go to the concert.

2641
03:02:34,801 --> 03:02:35,942
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe I should.

2642
03:02:36,623 --> 03:02:37,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I might not get the chance again.

2643
03:02:37,803 --> 03:02:42,266
[SPEAKER_09]: And for somebody that wasn't a Final Fantasy XI for so many years, you give me a lot to think about.

2644
03:02:43,587 --> 03:02:47,070
[SPEAKER_09]: A phone call to Orange Launch Radio might just set me back about 50 bucks for a ticket.

2645
03:02:47,631 --> 03:02:48,091
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2646
03:02:48,151 --> 03:02:48,572
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2647
03:02:49,273 --> 03:02:49,553
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2648
03:02:50,414 --> 03:02:51,635
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for phone calls tonight.

2649
03:02:51,715 --> 03:02:53,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, if you didn't get through, please, please tweet us.

2650
03:02:53,617 --> 03:02:55,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Twitter.com slash OLR or email us.

2651
03:02:55,599 --> 03:03:01,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com It does mean we are getting very close to the end of the show.

2652
03:03:02,045 --> 03:03:05,668
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting close to the end of the party at Summerfest and PlayStation Home.

2653
03:03:05,748 --> 03:03:06,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Last call.

2654
03:03:07,209 --> 03:03:08,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Last call, everybody.

2655
03:03:09,231 --> 03:03:13,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we close out tonight, I'm gonna ask Loki if he has any last minute stories.

2656
03:03:13,717 --> 03:03:13,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

2657
03:03:14,437 --> 03:03:14,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2658
03:03:15,979 --> 03:03:17,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even look.

2659
03:03:17,661 --> 03:03:18,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Shame on you.

2660
03:03:19,063 --> 03:03:23,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't think of anything that we didn't cover that was really, really big.

2661
03:03:23,848 --> 03:03:25,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft tweeted the show and said, Quite fun.

2662
03:03:25,209 --> 03:03:26,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he linked his picture on the Steam community.

2663
03:03:39,914 --> 03:04:06,700
[SPEAKER_09]: this is something I posted on the VOG Network forums if you're a fan of the game Beat Hazard and you have it on PC it is very easy to mod the game and it's not like you're not doing a bad thing you are editing text files the developers like put instructions on how to edit it in there you can actually add your own internet radio feeds because Beat Hazard you can play to internet radio and it's very easy to add VOG Network as a radio feed so yes you could play Beat Hazard to my voice

2664
03:04:08,260 --> 03:04:15,662
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's, you know, when there is no live or taped program on the Voicing Geeks Network, there is a music feed, so it's really meant for that.

2665
03:04:15,962 --> 03:04:18,802
[SPEAKER_09]: But some people are playing along to our voices, which I think is kind of funny, too.

2666
03:04:18,942 --> 03:04:20,223
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can do that.

2667
03:04:20,923 --> 03:04:22,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Marathon mode.

2668
03:04:22,283 --> 03:04:25,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we, like, yell something really fast or something, it gets harder?

2669
03:04:25,284 --> 03:04:25,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

2670
03:04:26,864 --> 03:04:28,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-dysinstalitarianism!

2671
03:04:28,024 --> 03:04:32,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Buh-duh-buh-duh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah

2672
03:04:37,214 --> 03:04:38,595
[SPEAKER_03]: She's breaking into prayers.

2673
03:04:38,875 --> 03:04:41,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the fuck it means.

2674
03:04:41,218 --> 03:04:41,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You might.

2675
03:04:41,998 --> 03:04:43,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do know what it means.

2676
03:04:43,320 --> 03:04:45,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, swear in Jewish frantically.

2677
03:04:45,782 --> 03:04:47,504
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be a boss that responds.

2678
03:04:47,544 --> 03:04:48,525
[SPEAKER_04]: You always get asked in the cafe.

2679
03:04:53,567 --> 03:04:54,167
[SPEAKER_09]: God, that's hot.

2680
03:04:54,247 --> 03:04:54,828
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

2681
03:04:54,848 --> 03:04:55,908
[SPEAKER_04]: People think, oh, you're Jewish.

2682
03:04:55,948 --> 03:04:57,609
[SPEAKER_04]: You must have grown up learning this.

2683
03:04:57,669 --> 03:04:59,850
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know because I grew up in Los Angeles.

2684
03:05:03,511 --> 03:05:03,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2685
03:05:05,032 --> 03:05:05,352
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2686
03:05:06,333 --> 03:05:09,474
[SPEAKER_09]: If you need more information on how to mod that, I posted something on our forums.

2687
03:05:09,574 --> 03:05:12,255
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not registered at vognetwork.com, why not?

2688
03:05:12,696 --> 03:05:14,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get your loot at vognetwork.com.

2689
03:05:15,077 --> 03:05:19,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Register and participate further with the show in the forums and so forth.

2690
03:05:19,179 --> 03:05:22,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Misty in chat says, Sky's voice, the game goes beat hazard.

2691
03:05:23,421 --> 03:05:24,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hope not.

2692
03:05:24,562 --> 03:05:24,882
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2693
03:05:26,103 --> 03:05:31,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, with all those tweets and all those chat comments, it's time to get to the end of the show.

2694
03:05:31,348 --> 03:05:34,651
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are going to go around one last time to get everybody's final thought.

2695
03:05:35,011 --> 03:05:36,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Starting with Marissa tonight.

2696
03:05:36,352 --> 03:05:38,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.

2697
03:05:39,015 --> 03:05:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it is a-okay that you don't play a whole lot of games.

2698
03:05:41,657 --> 03:05:47,102
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a nerdy enough girl, and I mean that in the best possible way, to fit right in with the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2699
03:05:47,443 --> 03:05:48,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for making me literally...

2700
03:05:49,444 --> 03:05:51,266
[SPEAKER_09]: literally laugh my ass off tonight.

2701
03:05:52,407 --> 03:05:52,928
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the best.

2702
03:05:53,228 --> 03:05:54,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Marissa, do you have any final thoughts?

2703
03:05:54,389 --> 03:05:56,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't take it as a high-five, but actually I do.

2704
03:05:56,111 --> 03:06:00,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I might need to explain myself a little bit to the audience, especially all those new listeners.

2705
03:06:00,935 --> 03:06:01,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do.

2706
03:06:01,836 --> 03:06:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I know some of you must be thinking, who is this large-breasted, yappy, singer-songwriter slutbag?

2707
03:06:07,361 --> 03:06:07,902
Ha ha ha ha!

2708
03:06:09,406 --> 03:06:12,027
[SPEAKER_04]: In reality, I actually have a major confession to make.

2709
03:06:12,828 --> 03:06:14,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a recovering comedian.

2710
03:06:16,350 --> 03:06:20,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that explains the majority of the material tonight.

2711
03:06:20,372 --> 03:06:21,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

2712
03:06:22,173 --> 03:06:23,873
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, thank you so much for having me.

2713
03:06:23,893 --> 03:06:24,554
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a pleasure.

2714
03:06:25,254 --> 03:06:29,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, any of you people out there that enjoy metal music, please check out Prylosis.

2715
03:06:29,997 --> 03:06:32,838
[SPEAKER_04]: P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S.

2716
03:06:32,918 --> 03:06:33,458
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fantastic.

2717
03:06:33,538 --> 03:06:34,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good CD.

2718
03:06:34,779 --> 03:06:35,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

2719
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:38,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're fantastic and they're funny, so they have a great YouTube channel.

2720
03:06:39,341 --> 03:06:43,704
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it was such a pleasure hanging out here and sharing such stories.

2721
03:06:43,984 --> 03:06:46,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, go check that out, especially fans of metal, Prylosis.

2722
03:06:46,905 --> 03:06:48,706
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like our guests to be able to plug stuff.

2723
03:06:48,746 --> 03:06:49,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to plug?

2724
03:06:50,669 --> 03:06:51,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

2725
03:06:51,229 --> 03:06:51,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2726
03:06:51,529 --> 03:07:08,157
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to see me not being a yappy slapback, if you want to see me singing, if you look at Marissa Con Gusto, which is my nickname, M-A-R-I-S-S-A-C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O on YouTube, there are some links of small clips of me doing little covers at Kulak's Woodshed.

2727
03:07:09,017 --> 03:07:10,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So, thanks.

2728
03:07:10,858 --> 03:07:15,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And looks like Loki just giving away little big planet carding codes right there in the chat room.

2729
03:07:19,107 --> 03:07:19,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Go get them.

2730
03:07:19,547 --> 03:07:21,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I didn't think of a way to give them away earlier.

2731
03:07:21,528 --> 03:07:21,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's alright.

2732
03:07:22,768 --> 03:07:24,369
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't get one through there, go to Joystick.

2733
03:07:24,389 --> 03:07:27,710
[SPEAKER_06]: They had an article a couple pages back that you can generate free codes.

2734
03:07:28,050 --> 03:07:29,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you think I got mine?

2735
03:07:30,190 --> 03:07:30,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2736
03:07:30,571 --> 03:07:30,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

2737
03:07:32,151 --> 03:07:32,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks again, Marissa.

2738
03:07:34,112 --> 03:07:34,892
[SPEAKER_09]: More final thoughts.

2739
03:07:35,352 --> 03:07:36,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

2740
03:07:37,833 --> 03:07:38,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of Wednesday.

2741
03:07:40,394 --> 03:07:40,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam's

2742
03:07:41,331 --> 03:07:42,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday happens to be August 1st.

2743
03:07:43,812 --> 03:07:45,772
[SPEAKER_06]: August 1st happens to be when the third gate opens.

2744
03:07:46,773 --> 03:07:47,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shit.

2745
03:07:47,513 --> 03:07:48,113
[SPEAKER_06]: The race is on.

2746
03:07:48,133 --> 03:07:49,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have time off from work to do it?

2747
03:07:49,794 --> 03:07:50,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I took the day off.

2748
03:07:50,394 --> 03:07:51,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for multiple reasons.

2749
03:07:51,394 --> 03:08:01,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I took the day off to take Josh, you know, because it's his second birthday, but also because I'm going to be staying up all night long finishing whatever game they have.

2750
03:08:03,318 --> 03:08:05,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Same reason I took September 25th off work.

2751
03:08:06,999 --> 03:08:07,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Understandable.

2752
03:08:09,574 --> 03:08:14,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the game is not hard enough for me where I can't finish it in one night.

2753
03:08:14,677 --> 03:08:21,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm going to be disappointed if I have to stop playing to sleep or do other things.

2754
03:08:25,803 --> 03:08:26,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows what it is?

2755
03:08:26,524 --> 03:08:26,884
[SPEAKER_06]: No one knows.

2756
03:08:27,104 --> 03:08:28,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hope it's not a crappy Facebook game.

2757
03:08:28,705 --> 03:08:30,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Please not be a crappy Facebook game.

2758
03:08:31,046 --> 03:08:35,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was already a crappy Facebook game for Gate 2, and I can't take another one.

2759
03:08:35,369 --> 03:08:38,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I will throw it over the table and just say, fuck it, I'm going to sleep.

2760
03:08:42,105 --> 03:08:43,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's see.

2761
03:08:44,571 --> 03:08:45,794
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2762
03:08:47,778 --> 03:08:49,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking, fucking, fuck, River Mirror.

2763
03:08:51,657 --> 03:08:59,339
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought tonight is, first, I want to thank everybody that participated in PlayStation Home Summerfest with us here on this lovely evening.

2764
03:08:59,399 --> 03:09:00,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Blender.

2765
03:09:00,259 --> 03:09:02,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Skull King, for putting that together.

2766
03:09:02,720 --> 03:09:03,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.

2767
03:09:04,341 --> 03:09:09,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to those that stayed up late in the Aurora 1.5 space.

2768
03:09:09,382 --> 03:09:12,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, longest event ever.

2769
03:09:13,403 --> 03:09:14,564
[SPEAKER_09]: and PlayStation Home.

2770
03:09:14,904 --> 03:09:16,966
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you guys for making it a success.

2771
03:09:16,986 --> 03:09:19,248
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still at least 10 people in there doing the running, man.

2772
03:09:19,588 --> 03:09:20,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

2773
03:09:20,469 --> 03:09:21,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much.

2774
03:09:22,211 --> 03:09:23,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Great community.

2775
03:09:23,272 --> 03:09:24,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate it.

2776
03:09:24,413 --> 03:09:26,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And a big welcome again to all the new listeners.

2777
03:09:26,554 --> 03:09:27,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, that's awesome.

2778
03:09:27,475 --> 03:09:30,258
[SPEAKER_09]: The rumors that they're going to be bringing a Battle Royale TV show.

2779
03:09:30,618 --> 03:09:31,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I feel about that.

2780
03:09:32,019 --> 03:09:33,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I read about that this week.

2781
03:09:33,100 --> 03:09:34,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, what the heck?

2782
03:09:35,182 --> 03:09:38,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, my final thought, my real final thought of the night would be

2783
03:09:39,105 --> 03:09:41,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Bilbo, Bilbo Baggins.

2784
03:09:41,908 --> 03:09:42,929
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, forget it.

2785
03:09:45,472 --> 03:09:46,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Leonard Nimoy.

2786
03:09:47,034 --> 03:09:47,955
[SPEAKER_09]: He's my hero, dude.

2787
03:09:48,456 --> 03:09:51,279
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that does it for another week at Orange Lounge Radio.

2788
03:09:51,319 --> 03:09:53,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if you like the show, all we ask, you know what?

2789
03:09:53,321 --> 03:09:55,323
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have advertising rampant throughout the show.

2790
03:09:55,724 --> 03:09:56,444
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not...

2791
03:09:57,125 --> 03:10:22,988
[SPEAKER_09]: sponsored by any gigantic you know multi-million dollar magazine we're sponsored by Keurig and Pinkberry we're sponsored by our fans so if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio please tell a friend or two about the show help spread the word leave us a nice review on iTunes or some other place to get podcasts we really appreciate all that homegrown support that being said though we probably will have some giveaways soon for a few things

2792
03:10:24,602 --> 03:10:25,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2793
03:10:25,703 --> 03:10:27,624
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like you just gave away three beta codes right there.

2794
03:10:27,644 --> 03:10:28,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, better than that.

2795
03:10:28,325 --> 03:10:29,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just crap.

2796
03:10:30,386 --> 03:10:32,428
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about actual things.

2797
03:10:32,588 --> 03:10:33,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I have things in my bag.

2798
03:10:33,969 --> 03:10:36,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I have things that I brought that I will bring more of.

2799
03:10:36,591 --> 03:10:37,872
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have things I have yet to bring.

2800
03:10:38,693 --> 03:10:38,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2801
03:10:39,834 --> 03:10:40,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a great night, everybody.

2802
03:10:40,654 --> 03:10:41,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So this stuff's already been brought in?

2803
03:10:43,216 --> 03:10:44,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this stuff has already been brought in.

2804
03:10:44,557 --> 03:10:46,719
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back in a week to do it all over again.

2805
03:10:46,739 --> 03:10:48,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next Sunday here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

2806
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:49,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great night.

2807
03:10:50,362 --> 03:10:53,384
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2808
03:10:54,024 --> 03:10:58,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
