WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Sky and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Tonight July 8th, 2012

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Sony purchases Gaikai

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
What does this mean for retail?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Microsoft securing a domain name leads to speculation

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
and a court in the European Union

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
makes a huge decision on reselling digital games

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
it's Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We are live as we always are

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Sunday nights at The Voice of Geeks

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
or VOG Network

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
www.vognetwork.com

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Sunday nights 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
right after Mr. Bobby Blackwolf

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and his fantastic show

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
also on the network

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
If you are listening to us live

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
get your butt in our chatroom and participate

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
so we can read your comments

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
live.vognetwork.com

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
We always appreciate you guys

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
participating along with our show

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I said your show, it is your show too

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
it's all of our shows

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
We do like to bill ourselves

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
as the show where every gamer has a voice

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
This voice you're hearing right now is Rob Roberts

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm one of three hosts on this show

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
along with the absent, sadly, tonight

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Dark Sakura

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Dark Sakura sadly called in a couple of hours

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
before the show tonight

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
She's not going to be able to make it

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
She's recovering from being sick

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
and she said

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Garris

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But joining us here in studio is tech master Loki

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Hello

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm doing good

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Alright, it's all good?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm full now because I've had like a liter of root beer

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
That is a lot of soda

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
What did you think about

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
not to get all political on this show

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
but since, you know, I know a lot of gamers

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
and I know a lot of gamers that drink soda

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
there was a lot of feedback to that whole New York City law

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
that they were talking about

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
where they were going to ban

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
the super-sized drinks and all that

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
What did you think about that?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Buy two drinks and

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
That's exactly

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Like, I just don't understand

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
What am I going to do?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I can't get a large soda

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I mean, the large soda, I understand

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
it's twice as much as the small soda

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
but how am I going to get a large

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Buy two of them

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I mean, I don't even understand why that's a problem

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I somehow knew in my mind

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
that's exactly what you'd say

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Maybe having done this show with you for ten years

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
and knowing you about us long is probably

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
I can predict these things

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I just, it's, it's dumb

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
What they need to do is

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
they need to just charge, you know

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Hey, I'll tell you what

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
We'll charge you, uh, you know

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
half price of a large for two

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
or, you know, each of the smalls

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
and then we'll give you a large cup for free

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
How about that?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
And then you just pour it in there

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and, you know, loophole

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
For ten years and knowing you about us long

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
feedback, sorry

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Ugh, I am not with it tonight

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm hosting the show tonight

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
I'm not with it

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I forgot to enable the live check-ins

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
over at vognetwork.com

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
and everybody in chat is screaming

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Man, turn it on, turn it on

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
We're having two hosts tonight

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Alan, I know we talked last week about

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
It's his birthday

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Happy birthday, Alan

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
If you're out there listening from work

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
where he's at right now

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I was going to forward you a picture

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
but I couldn't do it on my phone

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm totally off topic here, but

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
No, that's fine

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Help me fill time

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
There was a killer tattoo that I saw

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
that was a Golden Girls tattoo

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
What? A Golden Girls tattoo?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
A Golden Girls tattoo

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I was like, man, Rob would have to get that

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
What was it of? Be Arthur?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
It was of all of them

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
All of them, and it said

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Thank you for being a friend underneath it

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
It was great

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
I like that

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
It was on Facebook

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
But yeah, that was hilarious

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
So, um, yeah, lots of soda

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
See, I was almost gonna, I left early

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I was like, okay, I'm gonna go get something

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
I normally get because, you know,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
I have this extra time now

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
So I thought about, well, I could go to In-N-Out

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
But I really don't like In-N-Out that much

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
I mean, everyone loves their fries

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
But I think they taste like crap

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
They taste like a little, I don't know, it's

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Not crispy enough, I guess

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Not enough salt

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
They're very natural with their fries

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
And I don't like that

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I want it to taste artificial and salty

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Alright, live listeners, it's all better

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
You can check in now at vognetwork.com

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Sorry about that

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Things are gonna be a little broken tonight

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Because to hosting it, we kind of have to

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
I don't get as many little breaks while

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Dark Soccer's talking or whatever

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
And we couldn't scrounge up a third host fast enough

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
As I was saying, Alan worked today

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Although, to be fair, it was his choice

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Because his boss said, you know, you want the day off

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
It's your birthday, whatever

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
And Alan was like, oh, no, I want to make money on my birthday

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Sounds good

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Sounds good to me, right?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
So there you go

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Which, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
But I'm gonna

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
His boss, you know who his boss is?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
His boss is Jessica Harper from Understadation Live

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Really?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah, they work together

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Isn't that funny?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
That's awesome

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I know, it's like the VoG family at work and online

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
So that's pretty funny

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I don't know if I was supposed to say that

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
But oops, I have a big mouth

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Sorry about that

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Happy birthday

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Alright, anyhow

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Usually we get into talking about our gaming weeks

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
But I want to do a kickoff topic beforehand as we usually do

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
And I want to kind of address the pink elephant story in gaming

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
You know, we know we're not breaking news to you here on Orange Lounge Radio

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
But one thing we like to do is kind of present the news

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Put it on the table and talk about it a little bit

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
One of the big things that has everybody talking this week is

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Gaikai, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Because Gaikai got bought by Sony

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
And, you know, I know there's some more with that

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
That's gonna come up a little later in the show

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
But let's talk about kind of that first step there

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Because Sony has bought Gaikai

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Why, Loki?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Why did Sony feel they needed to buy Gaikai?

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
For streaming games, I mean, that could be useful

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
They've got a lot of, you know, Sony is an electronics manufacturer

05:54.000 --> 06:00.000
They have laptops, TVs, tablets, phones

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
So they want a way to stream the Sony or PlayStation brand

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
To all those devices at the same time

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Maybe somehow make them connected more with the PlayStation console

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Or just tying everything together

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I think that's a good way to do it

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Is just, you know, with a streaming platform

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
You know, I think I've made this comparison before

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And I may not have said it on the show

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But I totally thought it, which counts on the internet

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
And that is that the whole

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Sony has been doing a little bit of that streaming

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
With the whole PlayStation 3 to the PSP

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Even before the Vita technology

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Where you could, you know, remember

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I've brought this up on the show before

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
But if you're a new listener or whatever

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
It's one of the best hidden features

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
That will really surprise you about the PSP

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
Is that that whole Wii U technology has existed

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I'm not dogging Nintendo

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I realize Nintendo is going to try and perfect that with the Wii U

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
That's fine

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
But that technology to stream from your console

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Has kind of been there with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Granted, you're not streaming the full PlayStation 3 game

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That is not what's happening yet

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Although maybe this guy kind of purchases

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Well, and it's also not just

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You could stream like videos and other things

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
And it's also not just Sony stuff

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
I mean, you could stream it to pretty much any platform

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
That would be connected to the internet

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
So, I mean, you could really stream it to like

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Android tablets or an iPad or whatever

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And so that's kind of, I could see them being interested in that

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Or, hey, they could even be just improving their streaming technology

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
So that they can stream more sophisticated things to the Vita

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
You know, maybe PlayStation 4 type graphics or whatever

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
Not necessarily graphics, because obviously you can't push that through the Vita

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
But, you know, more intricate games that are going to have complicated graphics and stuff

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
To those devices

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
A little easier than you did with the PlayStation 3

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
And you can also do that PSP PS3 integration through the internet

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
If I remember correctly

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
You can actually, like, I could be at a friend's house

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Get into their Wi-Fi, turn on my PlayStation 3 at home

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And get whatever I need on there

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Although that's really limited to, I mean, video

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
You know, I wouldn't try to stream a game off of there

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Like a PS1 game or anything, because the lag would be crazy

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Can you imagine trying to play, like, Umjama Lamy over to that connection?

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Nope

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Although that might be a fun challenge

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
But, I mean, just the fact that I can, like, look at my home setup

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
On my home PlayStation 3 and my crossbar

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Is kind of cool

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
Like, it's a nerdy, whoa, Keanu Reeves meme moment, you know?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
So, I'd be very curious of PlayStation trying to perfect that technology

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
What about, you know, one thing I've been kind of thinking about is that

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
PlayStation Plus, they like to do these demos

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
The 60 minute demos of the games

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
But right now you have to pretty much download the whole darn game to your drive

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
In order to just play 60 minutes of it

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I mean, for some people, depending on your connection

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
It takes longer to download the demo than it does that you actually get to play the demo

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Maybe they're looking into Gaikai technology to stream demos

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
I mean, that would certainly be a great use for it that they could probably implement ASAP

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Uh, it's possible that they were looking at doing that

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I mean, they could do a bunch of different things

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
I just don't know

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
I don't know, I don't know what they're really doing with it yet, I mean

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
How do you, and let me pose this question to chat as well

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
And I'm behind on some chat comments

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
In fact, let me read a couple right here even though they're on other topics

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
But I don't want to ignore our chatroom at chat.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Excuse me, live.vognetwork.com

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
But AcidicVampire says

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I don't drink soda much, water or iced tea

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
You know, there's a lot of people that

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
You know, when you drink soda a lot

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
It's kind of like one of the first things you kick

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
When you decide you're going on a diet or whatever

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
And it can be effective, like, I stopped drinking Mountain Dew once

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I lost like 10 pounds alone

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Yeah, I could do that, but I'm not

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
ImmortalKing in our chatroom says

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Give yourselves credit, you've made a lot of exclusives

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Well, alright, maybe a few here or there

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
There may have been some like a week or two ago

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Regarding a new console or anything

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Perhaps, perhaps

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
But we don't talk about that kind of stuff

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Because everyone's going to forget it anyways

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And BobbyBlackWolf saves the day saying

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
chat.vognetwork.com, which I almost said

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
That will work too, so you can use live or chat

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
It's the same darn thing

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
But let me pose this question to you and pose this to the chat

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Going back to Gaikai a little bit

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
How would you feel if they came out and said

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
And I know this probably is not going to happen, disclaimer

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
But how would you feel anyway if they came out and said

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And on the Playstation 4, we're not going to have discs anymore

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
You're going to buy your games in your virtual library

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
But you'll be able to stream them on demand

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
And we hear that that's your option for the next console

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
It's basically a Gaikai slash on-live slash whatever console

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
How would you feel about that?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Would you still be on board with gaming or would you be out?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Absolutely would not be buying that console

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Because I don't want to have to fucking deal with that shit

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And when you say fucking deal with that shit

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Is it just you're pissed because you won't be able to

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Rampantly mod things like you've been able to do before

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I mean, it kind of puts the kibosh on all of that

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
No, not even at all, it's just I have to stream stuff

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I mean, I have an internet connection one day

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Or, you know, who knows?

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I mean, the internet's not always reliable

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Or I should say your internet connection's not always reliable

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
That's very true, we ran into that a couple weeks ago on the show

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
So, I mean, I don't really

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I mean, it's fun to play, you know, let's imagine a world

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
That this actually is going to happen

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
But it's never going to happen because they built a monster

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
That exists out there, that is their market share

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And there's no fucking way of getting rid of it

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Because honestly, you know, if they decided

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Hey, we're going to put out a console

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
It's only going to be able to stream games

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
You're not going to be able to buy it at the stores

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Then games will be like, who the fuck's going to sell your console?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Your accessories, your points cards

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Oh, that shit, your video cables

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, now you need us?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Oh, and you're not going to give us any of that software money?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Well, fuck you guys, good luck selling your console on your own

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
And that's honestly the situation that's going to be in

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
Because there's no money to be had in

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Definitely no money to be had in consoles

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
And definitely no money to be had in

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
At least not much money to be had in accessories

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
So it's got to come all from the games

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
And even though the profit margin in games aren't that great either

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
But still, people trade in stuff

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And there's no use market

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
So that's basically going to be taking away the money from

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
The largest retailer for video games

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
And I'm sorry, but they kind of control what people do

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And so as much as all these companies want to go all digital

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
It's not going to fucking happen

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Definitely a lot of negative reaction to my question in chat

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Which I kind of expected, I think we all did

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
But a lot of the reasoning focusing on the maintenance of your connection

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
That you can't always trust your internet connection to be stable

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Which I can definitely support

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
AcidicVampire says, if it's streaming, what if your net connection slows down

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Therefore your game stutters? Yes

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Reginator says, I want systems with optical storage

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
If only due to backwards compatibility

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Reimu says, suppose you can't connect to the internet

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
GameGuru says, screw that, I'll just stick with Steam then

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Interesting point about PC gaming

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I mean, streaming's been available on PC for a bit now

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And it certainly hasn't killed Steam

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Not by a long shot

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
They can do that as another option

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
To say, hey you know what, you can either download your game

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Or you can stream it instead

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
And that's cool that adding options is not a bad thing

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
But completely removing all other physical options

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Because you want to have control over the content

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
And make sure that there's no piracy

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And also making sure that

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I don't know, whatever other reasons it has

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
So that they have all the money, profit from it

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
It's just, it's not going to work

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Let me read a couple other very strong comments from chat

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
MegaBoyX says, I will never buy a system

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Unless I can own physical copies of the games

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Which, you know, some people want that type of control

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
You technically don't own those, but you know

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, we could get into that whole thing

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
But I mean, Alan, remember I plugged DBA

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Or Alan was here on the show last week

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And he plugged Zebay's auctions

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
And I plugged them on Twitter and stuff

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
He made decent money off those sales last week

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
I mean, they were old Game Boy Advance games

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
But apparently some of them are very hard to come by

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Especially in other countries

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
So he did pretty well off that

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
So, you know, being able to resell your games

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
When you need a little cash

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
I think is something we all kind of like to have

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
That kind of investment there

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I guess maybe it's like leasing a car versus buying a car

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't know

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Let me read the most blunt comment in chat, though

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
I want to talk about this for a minute

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Blender at live.vognetwork.com says

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
They do that, Sky, and I'm done gaming

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
That's probably the bluntest comment I've seen

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
But I can't say I blame him

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Like...

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
Go ahead

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay, I just...

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
Not to sound like real, like, disastrous

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Or dramatic or whatever

15:11.000 --> 15:16.000
But I've often wondered if that's what's ultimately gonna cause the end of OLR

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Especially when I see these stories about, you know,

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Xbox will prevent used game sales

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
PlayStation gets Gaikai

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
And maybe will stream only

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Although they probably won't

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
And all this other stuff, you know, I sometimes wonder

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
I wonder if there's gonna be another video game crash

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And we're just gonna stop being fans of gaming

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
And that's ultimately what's gonna probably end the show

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
No, that's not gonna happen at all

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
And here's why it's not gonna happen

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Because, you know, all that's gonna mean

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
You know, just because a console fails

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Or an idea fails

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Doesn't mean the whole industry's just gonna go belly up

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I mean, look at it

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Let's say the PlayStation 4 actually

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Let's say Sony is stupid enough to actually say

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Okay, we're gonna make this console streaming only

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Well, you've got other console manufacturers

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
That don't necessarily have to follow that

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
And, you know, we know that the Wii U's not gonna be that way

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
So, I mean, that's just stupid right there

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
So people just won't buy the PlayStation 4 instead

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Let's assume that all of them are really dumb

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
And they all decided to go that way

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Well, hey, you know, you don't have to give up gaming

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I mean, hello, there are how many generations of fucking game systems

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
You can't tell me you've played every single fucking game that's in existence

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
I mean, there's plenty that keep you entertained until you're dead

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I mean, seriously, you don't need to

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That's true, it's very true

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
You don't need to buy brand new fucking games

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
And, hello, you could go play on a PC

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Because none of that bullshit's there

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Or you could just... indie games

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
Yeah, indie games

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
I mean, there's a ton of shit out there that you can be playing

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
You don't need to be relying on

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, all these new systems have to be successful

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, you won't have these really great games that are on consoles

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Because you don't want to stream everything, which is fine

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Because I don't blame you

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And also, it's not going to work anyways

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Because why am I going to stream all this content to my system

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
And then hit my bandwidth caps for my internet providers

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
We're just not in a world right now where it's viable to do that

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
Hey, Comcast is up in that cap to 300, apparently

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
Ooh, let me put it this way, okay

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
I could be rampantly pirating for an entire month

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And I wouldn't hit that cap, okay

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
I mean, it's a large cap, but I haven't ever done, like, streaming constantly

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
With, you know, gaming and stuff

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
And honestly, I don't want to do that

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I haven't tried it online, maybe I should

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
GameGuru in chat says

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't think there will be another game crash

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
If anything crashes, it will only be the console industry

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Save Nintendo, who lived through that shit

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And I think...

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Nintendo didn't really live through it

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
At least not in America

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
I mean, I can't speak to really Japan

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
But they definitely didn't live through it in America

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Because the NES wasn't really out when the bottom fell out of the market

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
I mean, that was mainly the Atari 2600 and just the oversaturation of games

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
Especially the quality and the price that really drove things down

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
But, I mean, I could...

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen in this next cycle of consoles that's coming out

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
And it will be bad decisions that cause it to happen

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
But, anyway, don't run around crying, you know,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
Oh, OLR threatens to end, no, cause funny enough

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
I arrived at a similar conclusion that

18:17.000 --> 18:21.000
Well, we could always talk about classic games and food

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
There you go

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
There's never gonna be nothing that we can't...

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
I mean, just because, you know, it's...

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I mean, let's say the industry crashes

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
What are we gonna have?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Just real quick, Black Wolf clarifies

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
The arcade games were out before the crash

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
So, like, Donkey Kong and stuff was out around that time

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
There's plenty of stuff to talk about

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Anyway

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
There's plenty of stuff

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
When I all of a sudden go,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, I can't buy a new system

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
I just hate games now

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I'm just gonna leave

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
We would just have to change the format again

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
But, anyway, I don't...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Let's not go further down that road

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Cause that's not gonna happen for a long time

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
And there are, you know, there are...

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm sure by the time the next E3 rolls around

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And we actually get to see these consoles and the offerings

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
There'll be a little more excitement

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
At least I hope to hell there are

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
If not, we'll talk about the Playstation 3 and the 360 a little longer

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
They're not gonna go streaming only

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
It's just not gonna happen

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
Alright

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Live.vognetwork.com again if you want to participate along with the show

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And offer up your chat comments

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Going back to the present a little bit

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Or maybe games, classic games that you've been playing this week

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Dark Soccer, if she was here, she told me to say this to you listeners

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
She would be talking about Garrus and more Garrus

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
She has been playing more Mass Effect 3

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
I think she's about, she's at least halfway through the game

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
From what she'll be

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
She got to the romance, she did get to romance Garrus again

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
In part 3, I know that

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Her femshep and Garrus went on their little date

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
And I think she's, it sounds to me like she's about half to two thirds way through the game

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
So hopefully by next week's show

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Since you know cause she ain't here

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
And she's at home recovering and resting her voice and all that

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
She's playing Mass Effect

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
She'll probably have that stuff beat by next week

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So we can ask her about the ending

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Anyway, so I know that's Dark Soccer's gaming week

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Let's go to Loki's gaming week

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Well I started off by finishing up playing

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Ultimate Collector Garage Sale

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Which is the game that's tied in with that Ready Player One contest

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Fucking hated that game

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Ever fired my body so I

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Wanted to get that out of the way

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And I did, I finally got the DeLorean in game

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Got my, you know

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Leaderboard position

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
And have the new website for the

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Last challenge which will open up on Wednesday August 1st

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Well actually technically Tuesday night

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Cause it's Eastern time

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
Which I've already made plans on how I'm going to tackle that

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Including staying up all night if I have to

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Cause that's the one that's actually gonna count

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Cause right now it doesn't really matter what your position is

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Even though it was number 14 for the second challenge

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
I was gonna say

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
I heard that you placed like 14

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
So does that mean you're number 14 like overall right now?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
It doesn't matter, it's just for fun

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
The leaderboard is just how fast you completed the second one

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
But it's really the last one because

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
It's whoever completed the first two challenges

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
And whoever finishes the last one first

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Is gonna be it

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
And they said it's really hard the last challenge but

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
I mean we'll see

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
I bet it's gonna be something like

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
It's gonna be like Super Meat Boy Hard

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Or like the Impossible Game

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Or VVVV but like even harder

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
I hope it is something like that

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Cause I've actually played quite a bit of that stuff

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
I bet it's gonna be one of those style of games

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
That's gonna just make you wanna poke your eyeball out like

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't care that'd be fun

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
And you know what I'd rather have it be that

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Than wanting to poke my eyeballs out

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
For playing that stupid Ultimate Collector thing

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Which is so goddamn boring

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
There is a trick to it I mean

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
You just have to get a lot of friends on Facebook

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
That are playing that

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
And so I did that and

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
You know I was able to

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Cause you can send energy to each other

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
And that's how you can do it without having to pay anything

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I have to play this a little bit

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Cause this is a link that

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Alan sent me on my Facebook this week

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
It's off of Tumblr and it's credited

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
The source is KidXForever

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I have no idea it's Tumblr

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
I can never tell how this works and who gets credit for it

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
But here you go

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
It's somebody playing the impossible game

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
And giving their commentary

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
And this is what I picture Loki is gonna sound like

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
During that final gate competition

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Oh it says Achievement Hunter

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Oh yeah it's that Rooster Teeth thing

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Oh okay then there you go it's Rooster Teeth

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
So here you go

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Let me play a little bit of this here if I can

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
So they're hopping along to the bricks

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
He'll fuck up here in a minute

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
That looks pretty hard

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
That's probably the type of thing you're gonna have to play

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
FUCK!

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Holy shit this is way harder than the original

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
This is like two seconds

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
This is the beginning of the fucking level

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
And it's like double spikes, triple spikes

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
Fucking shit you gotta jump over

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It's fast as fuck too

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Damn it! Come on you fuck, come on you fuck

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
JUMP- GOD DAMN IT MOTHERFUCKER

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I always fuck up that last part

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
By last part I mean the end of the very first fucking-

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Okay the video goes on like that for like five minutes

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
But that's totally gonna be you that night

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Playing that game

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
GOD DAMN IT

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
They just fucking did this so they don't have to fucking give the DeLorean away

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Mother fuckers

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
First that fucking Facebook game and now this shit

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
On top of the DeLorean thing

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Let's just, you know

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Let's say I won that thing

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
I'd have to still fucking drive to L.A.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
And pay the taxes

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
And pay whatever goddamn registration

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Insurance

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
All that shit

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It sounds like a big pain in the ass actually

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
But I still wanna win

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Cause who doesn't wanna win?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Who doesn't wanna win? Exactly

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Speaking of which, that reminds me actually

24:04.000 --> 24:10.000
There's a Call of Duty 3 tournament down here in Stockton

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
One of my customers is actually having it

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And I need to find someone to play with me

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Cause none of my friends wanna go

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And that kinda sucks

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Anyone that listens that's in Sacramento

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
That happens to be somewhat good at

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Hey, you might be interested in

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And that ain't me

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
You know, interested in going down

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
See, cause I thought my old coworker might wanna do it

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
But he has his kids, you know, they're divorced

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
And they're shared custody

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
So he has his kids on that Saturday

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Cause we'd fucking tear that shit up

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Wait, so you have to have like a partner?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah, so I think it's a two on two

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
So if you wanna team up with Loki

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
You gotta be local though

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
You gotta be local

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
And don't be scary

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Yeah, Stockton's scary enough

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
We don't need any scary people

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Meeting me down there

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
At least that's what I'm thinking right now

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I haven't really discussed with the wife yet

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
But you know

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Well, cause I wanted to see if I could even get someone

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Cause you know, what's the point

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Me just going down there

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
But it might be fun

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
There's cash prizes involved

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Don't know if there's that many people

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Anyways, so other things to play this week

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Minecraft

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Playing Minecraft a lot

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I finally got the achievement for On a Rail

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Cause my rail system goes really far

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
The other thing though

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Is I'm not sure how

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Bobby was talking about that he got that achievement too

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And I was wondering in the back of my mind

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
He did not

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Cause I didn't know he was building a big rail system

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
He has an underwater rail system

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I actually saw there was a Minecraft thread

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
On the VoG forum that I saw his thing

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
No, but mine actually goes really

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Like all around the world

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
I'm gonna get the achievement by just going to Loki's world

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That's fine, come on in

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm redoing the whole mine cart thing

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Cause before I used to have it where you push the switch

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
And it would call the mine cart

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It just doesn't work now

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
I was gonna have the mine carts just traveling around

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
But I ran into a problem

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Where I accidentally

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
I was trying to get into one of my mine carts

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
And it caught one of the powered rails

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And just kept going

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
So I'm like, oh that's fine, I'll just catch up with it at the end

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And it never appeared

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
So I'm like, does the game just lose track of these mine carts

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Cause that's gonna fuck up my entire system

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
If I have these mine carts going around they just disappear

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Because, oh it's too far away

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That might be a problem

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
I don't know what I'm gonna do there

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
That's an issue

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
But yeah, it's been fun playing that

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
And a little bit of Modern Warfare 3

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Let's play a little bit of that

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Bobby says the one that he built was actually above ground

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
He couldn't get the underwater one to go long enough

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
So there you go

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Alright, anything else you wanna share with your gaming week?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Ah, that's it

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
My gaming week, I've actually still been playing

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
More Final Fantasy 11

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
It's kinda what I've been playing instead of WoW

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Cause there's really nothing to do in WoW right now

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Unless I wanna level in alt

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
So I'm really kinda just burned out on it

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Playing with friends a little bit has been Final Fantasy
