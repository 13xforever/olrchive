Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, July 1st, 2012, a full-time anime channel is console-bound,

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
a classic edutainment title is set to become a movie, and one gaming company turns 40 years old.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello, my friends out there on the Internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
where every gamer has a voice here at Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
We are live as we are every Sunday night at VOG Network, or the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGNetwork.com.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
and have some LOLs, and start 10 more years of the fun with my co-host.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Say hello first off to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Loki has curly fries.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I know, he always brings such yummy food and then waves it in front of us.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
I think that he should give me one.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
May I please have a curly fry?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Techmaster Loki here tonight, what do you say?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Aww, he's handing one over.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
They gave me small and a medium because they were out of large boxes.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
So is that like Jack in the Box math? Small plus medium equals large?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Oh my god, Grease.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Grease is truly the word.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
Joining us tonight, we have a special guest, somebody who hasn't been on the show in a while,

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
but he's no stranger to OLR, but maybe some of you haven't heard him before.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
Say hello to Alan!

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Hello.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
How are you doing?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm doing great.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Awesome. Now you're on the wonky mic tonight, I might have to have you switch out,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
because I've already heard some little crackle-shreckle.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
So yeah, chat, if I sound like crap, let us know. Don't let me go through the whole show like this.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Or pretend he's a robot.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
There you go. How are you doing?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm good.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
What's new with you since you were on the show last? I don't even remember when you were actually on the show.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Well, you've made cameo appearances, like one or two lines.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I'll be in the office playing a game and then I will run out into the living room and just shout something

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
that's relevant to the show when I'm not even on the show.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Does this microphone work?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
It's not even plugged in. It's muted.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I understand that, but would it work if you were plugged in?

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, in fact, the hissing is still happening, so I'm going to ask Alan to switch out the mic he's using

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
and pick up that other one instead. Let me actually mute that.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Live radio.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
The choice of live radio at vognetwork.com.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay, try again.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Okay.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
All right, you're just going to be a little quiet, so be sure you talk good and loud.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
I'll turn up your gain a little bit and I'll hopefully help.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Did you say you were going to turn up the gay a little bit?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
No, the game.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Hey.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
Hey, girl. Welcome to Orange Town Radio. What do?

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
Stop. So I got a job in early May that has me working nights.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
I work in a call center because it's an election year doing political surveys,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
and usually when OLR is taping for the last month and a half, I've been at work.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
I get home at like 10 o'clock or like 930 when the show's wrapping up.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I got a little promotion, so I'm going to have later hours,

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
but hopefully that doesn't start until next week.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
So here I am, taking advantage.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
So here you are taking advantage of the week off, I should say, that you have.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So welcome. All right, well, we are going to get in, of course, to all the news this week,

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
or lack thereof. Is it just me or was it really kind of a slow news week?

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I mean, when people are reporting on Twitter, that's usually an indication it's a slow week.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I've been in a Normandy-shaped bubble all week, so I haven't cared.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Well, it sounds like we need to get to gaming weeks, but first, before we get to gaming weeks

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
and the obvious game that Dark Soccer has been playing, I always like to do kind of a kickoff topic,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
and I've got to start with this one tonight.

03:42.000 --> 03:49.000
And I want to talk about what it means, and those that have seen the FUGL Question of the Week,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
which I'm going to read in Part B in a little bit, kind of know about this already,

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
but I wanted to talk a little bit about what it means to be a real gamer.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I want to read a conversation I was having with somebody online.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Now, I don't know this person super, super well, but they're a gamer and I'm a gamer,

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
and I was kind of trying to figure out, like, okay, maybe there's a multiplayer game we play in common or whatever.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
So I'm going to read this conversation that we have, and I want you guys to tell me what you think.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
So he asked me, what games are you playing?

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
And I said, I've been stupid addicted to Mass Effect 3.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
It's the first multiplayer game in a long time I can stand to play with strangers.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I just got into the whole series like three months ago, played all three games back to back.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And he replies, is that a first-person shooter?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
And I replied, it looks like one, but it doesn't really play like one.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
On the easiest difficulty, your team does all the work for you.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
I play a class that's more of a magic user, so I hang back.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You know, I'm trying to kind of like put it in RPG terms.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
So I hang back and blast everything.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
It's got a really strong story.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
I call it more of an RPG with FPS elements.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Now, before you guys correct me that Mass Effect isn't truly a first-person shooter.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
It's a third-person shooter.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm aware of this, but it has FPS elements.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
That's the key word.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
As in it doesn't make Jamie motion sick.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Right.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Or, you know, when it's sniper rifle, it's first-person.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
But it does, especially when you're playing multiplayer, it kind of feels like it's got a lot of that Halo-esque vibe to it.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
But it's different.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
I really, really like it.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
But here's the reply I got.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
Eh, first-person shooters aren't real games, and the people who play them are not real gamers.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
No offense.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Those are fighting words.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Hold on.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It gets better.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
I replied, LOL, there's a big difference between Battlefield or Modern Warfare and Mass Effect.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Trust me.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
No offense taken.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I know I'm a true gamer.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Happy face.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
And the reply, LOL, if you say so.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
I just feel fighting and first-person shooter games require no thought at all.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
So, yeah.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
LOL.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
The amount of side-eye at this table right now, we're all just like, really?

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
Ask any of the people who play in the Street Fighter tournaments and how they obsess over their technique.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I was just really taken aback.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, anyway, I replied back.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
I said, you know, I'm trying to be nice, but at this point I'm like, dude, what are you smoking?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
So I'm like, fighting games is a pretty broad category.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I'm not very good at a lot of the modern ones.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
But in some ways, combat on the 2600 is a fighting game.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
Like, I'm kind of trying to say, like, dude, you're being ignorant right now.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
So I asked back, I said, so, what does make a real gamer?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
No reply.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Of course.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Is this someone I know?

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
No, no, this is people online.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
You don't understand that you've been trolled.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
No, I don't think so.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
I think this person was very legitimate in their thinking.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
But I'm just, I was really surprised at how offended I was at that initial comment.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Like, that first person shooter players are not real gamers.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
I don't play first person shooters a lot.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I mean, but I've played Quake.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
I've played Doom.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I've played, you know.

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
Honestly, though, that argument that first person shooters and fighting game players are not real gamers is like saying people of color are not real people.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
I mean, it's just, seriously, that's how ignorant that statement is.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Okay, well.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I mean, it is.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I mean, seriously, it's like, oh, I'm sorry.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
These are games.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
Now, if he said casual game, like, you know, if they play Farmville, then yes, I might be able to side with that.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I don't know.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Dictionary.com.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Gamer.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
A person who plays games, especially computer or video games.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
The end.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Do you play games on your computer?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, I was actually playing a couple earlier today.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Do you play games on a console?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
But Jamie, one of them was a first person shooter.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
According to the dictionary, a gamer is one who plays games.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And you know, I played a fighting game before.

07:52.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm just trying to imagine this person, like, playing Civ 2 or Civ 3 blindfolded, like, with pins going into his body because the pain, like, brings him closer to the experience.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
So what kind of games does this person play?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
I have no idea.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I tried.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
I asked.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I didn't get a reply.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
I think this person gave up.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Because I'm just, you know.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Clearly I'm ignorant.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Clearly I'm an idiot.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
There's really all games out there have some sort of, you know, strategy or actual skill involvement.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, except for, like, you know, pure random luck games like, you know, gambling a slot machine.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
There's no sort of skill there.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
But, um, so it's kind of stupid to say, oh, well, they're not really gamers.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
No, I understand that, yeah, you can get a lot of people button mashing first person shooters and, you know, fighting games.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
But you can do the same.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
You can button mash through fucking.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Okay.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Okay.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Merriam-Webster dictionary.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Gamer.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
A player who is game, especially an athlete who relishes competition.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Two.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
A person who plays games, especially a person who regularly plays computer or video games.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Merriam-Webster.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Now I'm going to try, um, what's the other one?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Webster.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
Let's go to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate live here with our show.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
And you can check in if you're listening live at vognetwork.com and get your points.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I'm going to talk about check-ins in a little bit, but we've still got some ground to cover.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
So reading from chat, I want to start with Burr tonight because this comment that he says here is it for me.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
It's hitting the nail on the head.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Burr says, you're not a real gamer unless you only play what I play.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
And that's, I think, exactly where this guy is at.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
And I'm going to guess, he didn't answer my question.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
He's had a day and a half to answer and he's not answered.

09:41.000 --> 09:48.000
I would guess a real gamer is one that plays Final Fantasy and, you know, RPGs.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Because I really wanted to counter that with, oh, so you're into Oblivion?

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
Because there's something about that whole East versus West RPG thing.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
And I bet this guy would have been like, no, Oblivion's a first person shooter.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
But like, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Not really, but I'm going to kill you with words.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Well, he's wrong anyway.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
He is, he is.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
We have a dictionary definition, one who plays games.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
And I would even expand on that, that there's tabletop gamers, you know?

10:14.000 --> 10:21.000
We used to say, you know, when we talk about going to a tabletop game, we say we're going to game.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
I mean, so it's the same thing.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
A gamer is one who plays games.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
AcidicVampire in our chat room says, seriously, tell that guy to play Bioshock and then we'll talk.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
There's a really good example of a first person shooter that's like definitely not Modern Warfare, Battlefield.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Or Portal.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Oh yeah, Portal's a great, I mean, Portal, Portal.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
And that actually doesn't make me motion sick.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Portal is an amazing first person shooter, if you think about it.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, this is also exactly like, you know, you're not a real sports, you're not a sports fan.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
You know, if you like hockey or soccer, you know.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Football!

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Football!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Real football.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Football.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm calling it soccer because I'm American.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I can do that.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I can be ignorant like that.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
But we all know what I'm talking about.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Okay, so this guy is obviously often La La Land whatever.

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
There's a reason why I bring it up on the show, though, is because what is it about this gaming culture

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
where we're so quick to judge other people and exclude them?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
And I'm going to give you an example.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Going to our chat room, GameGuru says,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
The casual games are just extensions of genres from gaming's past.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
For example, Bejeweled is a puzzle game like Tetris.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
So GameGuru brought up casual games, to which I say, all right, then Facebook games.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Sims? They're kind of sims?

11:42.000 --> 11:50.000
Would somebody that plays The Sims Social and Cityville and Price is Right slots, is that a gamer?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
The slots, no, because it's a slot machine type thing.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Isn't that a game?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
This is how I look at it.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
You have a gamer as a blanket, and then you have types of gamers.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
You have casual gamers.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
You have your RPG gamers.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You have your tabletop gamers, like I said earlier.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
You've got your board gamers.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
One who plays a game is a gamer.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
It just depends on what they like.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
But why do people feel the need, then, to assert that their way is the only way?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Because Catholics are like that, too.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
No, no, no, I'm going somewhere with this.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
It's like religion and politics.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
The Catholics think their way is the only way.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm using a blanket term.

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
The Southern Baptists, of course, think everyone else is going to hell.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
It's that type of mentality.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
It's we are better than you because you don't think the way that we do.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You have the libertarians.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, Lord, let's not go with the libertarians.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You have the socialists.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
You've got Republicans, Democrats.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Everyone thinks that their way is the best,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and anyone who is not in their group is immediately inferior

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
because they're not in that group.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Alan?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
My theory is he's insecure.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
He's caught shit for the games that he's played before.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
He now has a support group, and he's old enough to play the games

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
that he likes to play where he doesn't give a fuck,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and he doesn't catch shit for it anymore,

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
but because he's built that support group of these are the games I play,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
these are where my friends are, he's still got that insecurity.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
He only wants to relate to people that play the same stuff as him.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
That's actually a fascinating way to look at it

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
because you're essentially saying the reason why he's like that

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
is because it happened to him in reverse.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That's essentially what you're saying, right?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Yeah. He's insecure, and he's got some lingering issues.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And I can see that.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
He's caught shit for playing the games that he likes to play,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
but now he's fine, but that's still his safe space.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
I could totally see that because back when it was all about

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Dance Dance Revolution for us and so forth,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
there were people that said all they talk about is DDR.

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
It's not a video game show. It's a DDR rave lights show.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Lights don't come through radio.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
And I know that you love this game, so this is a bad example,

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
but think back when you were crazy about DDR,

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
and someone was like, oh, I love music rhythm games.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
And you're like, what? And they say, Parappa?

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
And you're all, hm. Okay.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
He plays Parappa, guys! Ha ha ha!

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Oh, here's a good example.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
In the Groove.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna fan those plays.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, but In the Groove was actually...

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
No, In the Groove was fine.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
I'm not even gonna go there. Just walk away.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
Porkchop in chat asks, Sky, is this guy young or old?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
It's a bit of a juvenile opinion. Mid-20s.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, it's kind of mid-20s. Especially nowadays, with, you know...

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Nowadays, those whippersnaps!

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
Basically, a lot of the people I interact with on forums

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
that are of the teenage age range

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
are pretty immature, and I can imagine that they,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
unless they finally grow up,

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
that they kind of continue to go that way through their mid-20s.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
It's like everybody's a decade behind nowadays.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Well, I think at the end of the day, if you guys are going to, you know,

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
judge other people based on the games they play,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
just kind of, you know, watch yourself.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
Watch yourself, because we're creating this cycle, right,

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
where now, you know, that person that we point our fingers at

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
will turn around and do it to somebody else.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
It's like we should try to be more inclusive, right?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Am I being too much of a hippie?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
You're old enough to be thoroughly over it,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
so you just don't understand why people just won't let shit go.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Well, and also, maybe it's just that, I mean, this, this, let me also say this.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
This guy that I was talking to...

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Is he from Grindr? You can tell your boyfriend.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Is he from Grindr?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
So, well, you know about how, you know, we're trying to meet, you know,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
other gamers, right, that we can hang out with locally and things like that.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
So I got excited, like, oh, this is another gamer.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
But now I'm like, I don't want to meet this guy because he's an idiot.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Well, also, you know, you mentioned the age group,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
and I'm going to tell you something.

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
This is going into a little bit of biology and psychology, okay?

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
When a person is in their 20s, and this is like, for women it's like around 25,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
and for guys it's around 27, the brain is still forming.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I mean, literally, it is actually.

16:15.000 --> 16:21.000
So the mind is more focused on immediate reward as opposed to long-term consequence.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
So this person...

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Bow chicka wow wow.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
So this person is in the mindset where everything is right now,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
everything is immediate.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
You don't like what I like, so I don't care about what you like.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
What's in front of me is what's important to me.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
And, you know, I'm sure that all of us understand that once you hit your 30s,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
you kind of don't give a crap about that kind of drama anymore.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
So it's not as important.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
I guarantee you, this person, when he's in his 30s, is going to say,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
man, I was stupid.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.000
It's like pulling up your live journal from six years ago and going, oh.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Oh, God, I did that.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
I wanted to go back in time and shoot myself.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
All right.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Look, we've got to move on with the show.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
I just, you know, I was so struck by that conversation.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I was just like, oh, my God, I've got to bring it up on OLR.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
And the one thing I didn't want to say, when I was talking to that guy,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
he did not know that I did this show, like that I've been doing it and so forth

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
and where I'm coming from.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
But it's, I don't know, it's kind of funny.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
It pays to do your research, individual.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Facebook stalk me next time.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
All right.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Moving on.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we're all gamers here at OLR

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
and so are you guys in our chat room.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And if you're listening to this on the podcast feed,

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
you must enjoy video games enough that you want to hear a bunch of strangers

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
online talk about it.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
And DDR dollar bill, I can't go back in time and shoot myself

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
because I wouldn't be here.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
So maybe I'd just smack myself around

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
and then use that little Men in Black thing to make me forget.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
You would have to be a looper in order to do that.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
All right.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Gaming week, star soccer, why don't you start us off.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
You said something about being holed up in the Normandy?

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, I was hanging out in the life support room and in the battery.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
So were you getting it on with Dr.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Chalk was, because that's what I've always wanted to know.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
But it's funny when you go drinking with her

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
and she starts doing the whole dancing thing is pretty funny.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
Black Wolf in our chat room says Garris isn't a gamer.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
I bet he plays some games.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
All right, moving on.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
But yeah, I've been playing.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
I started Mass Effect 2 last weekend and I'm at the last set of missions now.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
So I haven't beaten a game that had that much stuff in it that quickly

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
since Final Fantasy six or three when it was out.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
So that's saying something.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
No, I take that back.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I played do prison pretty quickly.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
So and the DLC is all it's all really good, right?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
They're all enjoyable.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Oh, hell yeah.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
And yeah, they were saying that the overlord one was supposed to be like two and a half out.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
You said it was like two and a half hours.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
I don't know.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
That was somebody else in the Senate.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
But I finished it like an hour.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
And I just rushed.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
But the story's good.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
And the ending is, you know, yeah.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Creepy and scary.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
And yeah, that one.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Oh, my God.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
I felt so bad for I mean, it's like it really sucks you in emotionally.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
So you care about the characters.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
And I was like, oh, my God, why don't you just shoot this guy in the face?

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
So, yeah, I totally, totally.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I took Samara, by the way.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
Not Morant because Morant was a bitch, which is the right thing to do.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Let's be real.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
But I have seen the Morant seduction scene.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
And that was pretty funny because dude, Shep is just stupid.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Bad voice acting.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
But I'm totally going after Garrus.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
But I have a save file to where I can go back for Thane if I wanted to.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
The end.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
So now I have to go by Mass Effect 3 tomorrow.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Mass Effect, Mass Effect, more Mass Effect.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Loki.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I did play some WoW for five minutes.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
You got to get use out of that annual pass.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah, well, I logged in so I wouldn't get kicked out of the guild.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
Actually, I'm switching it up because I know Loki's about to go on a rant.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
So let's go to, let's go to Alan first.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Alan, how was your gaming week?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
It was alright.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
I checked in on my Minecraft world.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
I have an article that I need to finish for VOG about Minecraft.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm playing in survival mode.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I finally found a world that has a terrain that I like.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
And I'm playing on survival mode where you have to eat and there's supposed to be monsters,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
but I have it on peaceful.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
And I thought, I'm going to play it on peaceful until I find a good cave and I build my house.

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
But I'm so into the exploration and creativity that every time I flip it from survival to easy

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
so that the monsters will spawn, they just irritate me.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
It's not like I'm afraid of dying.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It's like I'm trying to build an expansion in my house.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Fucking go away, creeper.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
So I just turn the monsters off.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
So maybe the whole combat aspect of Minecraft isn't for me.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I don't know.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I'm trying to unlock all the characters.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
I've been working on my dude, Paragon, Mass Effect 3

20:40.000 --> 20:45.000
because I've already seen my femshep renegade ending a couple weeks ago.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
And I checked out Dragon Age 2 to see how long I had spent on it

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
because I haven't touched that game since February.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
And I had spent 14 hours and I deleted the save so I could start over

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
because I don't remember a goddamn thing.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And that's it. Those are my three games.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
Alright.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
Can I talk about how I obtained Mass Effect 3?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Yeah, actually.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
Because it was legal, but it was one of those like, hmm...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I think Loki might remember this story, but a couple months ago

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
when Battlefield 3 came out, there was this scandal

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
where people had bought codes from overseas

21:17.000 --> 21:21.000
like the China edition of a code for cheap.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
And EA wanted to disable the codes. Something like that.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I don't remember that.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
Okay.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, I was trying to price hunt Mass Effect 3 for Origin

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
thinking that maybe Amazon or Best Buy or something had a code.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
So I went to Google Shopping and I just said,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Mass Effect 3 sale, Origin code, and I found a site

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
and I'm not going to say what site it is

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
because I don't want it to sound like that OLR is endorsing this.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
But you just told everyone how to find it.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Sorry.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Well, there's three or four sites like this

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
and I picked the best looking one.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
We're not endorsing it. That's all we need to say.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
So I found a site that had a Mass Effect 3 Origin code

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
for like 22 bucks, which is a huge steal.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And they took PayPal and I've had good experiences before

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
using PayPal on eBay where it was a fraud and I got my money back.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
It takes two weeks, but I was like, all right.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
If this is a scam, it's through PayPal.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
I had a reasonable expectation of being safe.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I get the code within a minute of submitting it

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
and it's a little PNG file.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
It's literally a scan of the code that you get on the back of the jewel case

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
if you bought it.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I put it into Origin and it worked fine.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
And then in Origin it says, Mass Effect 3 Standard Edition US slash UK slash RU.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
So it's some like European code.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
So this site just bought a bunch of overseas codes in bulk.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
I didn't have a problem with it.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Or picked them up out of a box that fell off a truck.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Yeah.

22:41.000 --> 22:48.000
Well, actually, it depends on how the DLC codes out to the retailers

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
because there's been times, and I still have hundreds of them left,

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
that they will send you an Excel sheet with codes listed.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
You guys have X amount of copies that you've ordered from this company.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Here's the codes for your PS3 copies.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Here's the codes for your 360 copies.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
Some of those may be going to rental stores or libraries

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
or people that don't need the DLC codes.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
And so there's a bunch of excess left over.

23:16.000 --> 23:22.000
Now, I don't know about the ones that would be included in a package or whatever,

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
but a lot of that stuff that goes to GameStop

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
or even small mom and pop retailers,

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
there could be a bunch of that stuff lying around out there

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
because people didn't need them.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
So I can play multiplayer fine on the official EA servers.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
I'm not worried about the SWAT team repelling down and crashing through the windows

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
or Origin spontaneously just turning off my Mass Effect 3.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
But yeah, I took a risk on one of these sites and spent $22 for a $59 game.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
And I'm not saying I would do it again, but I didn't have a bad experience.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
It worked out fine for me.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
Interesting. See, I'm trying to figure out where to...

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
When I showed you the site, because you're considering getting Mass Effect 3 for PC

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
so that you could play with me...

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Which I ended up getting through Best Buy when they had a sale.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And you looked at the site and you're like,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
honey, this looks shady as fuck.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
And I was like, well, I did Google the name of the site plus scam,

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
name of the site reviews to see if people had bad experiences.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And it looked legit, so that's why I went for it.

24:18.000 --> 24:22.000
But yeah, there's something about the whole concept of buying overseas codes domestically

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
that are that cheap is weird, but I don't know.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Keep monitoring your credit card statements. That's all I'm going to say.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Well, that's why I use PayPal.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Oh, I wouldn't use my credit card.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.000
I hope it was just excess copies in Russia or something that got unloaded on this site.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
I really hope you don't get screwed. So we'll see.

24:43.000 --> 24:49.000
I would never advise somebody to do that. You're taking a huge, huge risk.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
I mean, I know you obviously very well.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
You weighed the pros and the cons and went for it.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
But do you think you would buy another game this way?

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
Or do you think maybe it's worth the extra $10 or whatever next time

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
to just have the peace of mind it's a legit place?

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I would buy it through a legit, or more legit,

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
like an actual game client like Steam or Origin or Amazon.

25:11.000 --> 25:17.000
But because I'm so broke right now, I didn't want to download a...

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
I think that's important to say, too, is that you are in a financial bind right now, right?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
Like, I don't want to make you...

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
Boy, I'm making this up.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
But you're at a financial not-so-great point right now.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
So the fact that you could save that money and still get the game you wanted was really important.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
I absolutely wanted to pay money for the game.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I was just like, how cheap can I do this?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
And I found a way that worked.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Well, and there's actually, on Amazon right now,

25:39.000 --> 25:44.000
there's a seller selling a boxed copy and everything for $28.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
And you pay $4 shipping.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
Although I could pay $39 on Amazon right now and buy the boxed copy and get free shipping.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.000
So if I don't see it cheaper, it fries, pretty much.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
All right.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
Well, thank you for sharing your story.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Let's move on and talk about Loki's Gaming Week,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
which, as I understand from what we heard at the end of Bobby Blackwell's show,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
was a little bit controversial, right, Loki?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Well, yeah, some of it.

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
So I play lots of Minecraft, which is part of the course.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
Finished my demon head entrance to my volcanic lair type thing.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
And it looks pretty awesome.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
Although one gripe I have about the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is,

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
you know how you take screenshots and stuff and you can set your gamma settings

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
so that you can actually see it on your TV?

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
It doesn't adjust for those settings when you take a screenshot.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
So it was completely bright on my screen, but completely dark in the picture I took.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
It's kind of annoying.

26:40.000 --> 26:47.000
They should make it so that it shows what you have on your screen.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
Then I played more Modern Warfare 3, and that was fun.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Still kicking ass.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
Hopefully they're supposed to be releasing a new free map soon for Terminal,

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
which I believe is a remade Modern Warfare 2 map.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So I played a bit of that.

27:05.000 --> 27:13.000
And then you may remember I talked a little bit about this whole Ready Player One contest thing

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
and how they have three gates or whatever that you're going to go through

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
and have video game challenges.

27:19.000 --> 27:26.000
And all of them were supposed to be retro challenges kind of tied into the whole book

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
because it was all about old retro 80s games and stuff.

27:29.000 --> 27:40.000
One of the challenges they had was playing Joust against this computer player and Zork.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
God, I can't remember the third challenge.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I think it was playing music or something.

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
Anyways, so stuff like that.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
So the first gate that they had was a 2600 game.

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
It was a brand new 2600 game that they made specifically for this whole contest, which is awesome.

27:58.000 --> 28:04.000
It has really cool, and it kind of keeps with the whole theme of the book.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
The second gate, however, not quite along those lines.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Instead, it is go play this game that's created by Richard Garrett,

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
the guy behind Ultima Online.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
He's traveled the space and all that fun shit.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
And it's a game called Ultimate Collector Garage Sale.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
It's a Facebook game in beta right now.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
So it is fucking broken.

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
Just so laggy and broken and just terrible.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
And here's the best part about the game.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
It's, of course, one of those free games that you would see on Facebook

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
that nickel and dime you for every goddamn thing that you want to do in it.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
And that's no different with this one.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And it looks kind of like The Sims.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
But there's already people that have completed this challenge.

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
And I can tell you right now, having played this game for about four hours,

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
there is no way you can do that in that time frame without paying money

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
to get extra dollars or whatever to be able to cycle things faster,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
give yourself more energy, and that kind of thing.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
So basically, they bought their way through this game.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
And it's definitely proven in the screenshot of the first person that did finish it.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
He had two credit cards sitting there right next to his computer monitor.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
So it's just kind of a really bad vibe.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
I mean, they went from this really cool retro game challenge thing to,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
hey, play this Facebook game.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You know there's fucking money switching hands there.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
And yeah, it's kind of cool that they hid some stuff in here.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
But I've played this game for, like I said, about four hours.

29:44.000 --> 29:52.000
And I've only come up with maybe two of the items I'm supposed to be finding for this thing.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
And there's about, I think, 50 some items that you need to find.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And it's all random.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
So there's no...

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
I'll be lucky to finish it within a month's time, let alone knocking it out in a day,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
which I was hoping to be able to knock everything out in a day or so

30:10.000 --> 30:15.000
because, you know, get a jump on it like I didn't quite do with the first gate.

30:15.000 --> 30:20.000
But it's really disappointing that this is what it's come down to,

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
is that they have this crappy Facebook game.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And I hate playing Facebook games.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Or at least this type of game where it's like,

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
oh yeah, you know, you want to rummage through that box.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Well, it's going to cost you one energy.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.000
Oh, you don't have energy right now?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
You can pay some money to get some energy.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
Or hey, you don't have enough money to buy that upgrade.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
The type of competition you guys are playing, that was a terrible idea.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.000
It really was.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
There's no skill in this.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
The skill in this is having the patience to fucking wait this long.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
They got to pay for that DeLorean somehow.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
He can pay for it with his book sales money.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
I mean, he didn't have to do this.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
Maybe the next contest will be getting to play Tabula Rasa,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
the other great Lord British game.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
No, I shouldn't kick him when he's down.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
Obviously the Ultima series was phenomenal, so important to gaming's history.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And I don't blame him at all.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
So what, he wants to create a Facebook game?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
That's fine.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I have no problem with him creating a Facebook game.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
I have a problem with him using this Facebook game in the state that it is.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
It's not finished.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
Using it to further this contest.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.000
And yeah, it's cool that they hit all these different items in this game.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.000
But it's not done.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
It's buggy.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
When I first started playing it, I ran into a glitch where I was selling stuff in my garage sale,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
and the items disappeared.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
And then those racks that I was using, I couldn't put anything on them.

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
And you're limited to a certain amount of racks that you have in your garage sale area, I guess.

31:53.000 --> 31:59.000
And so it was stuck for a few days, and I couldn't do anything.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
And then they finally fixed it, and then they had people having trouble logging into the server

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
because the server was down because too many people were hammering it.

32:07.000 --> 32:14.000
And then there was an issue where the link from the actual contest to the Facebook game was broken.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
It's just bad.

32:17.000 --> 32:22.000
And I don't like, you know, I just don't like the way it's being handled right now.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
But I'm still going to play it because I have to in order to get to the next gate,

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
or at least be able to be in the running still, so it's just sad that I have to do this the hard way,

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
whereas I see these guys, yeah, I beat it in four hours!

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
But it won't matter at the end of the day, right?

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
You just have to clear it in 30 days, right?

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
I just have to clear it within 30 days, but I just hope the last gate isn't anything like this bullshit.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
Yeah, that would be a real stinker on the competition.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
So that's that.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
Um... I think that's it.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
Alright, so my gaming week. A lot of the same old stuff.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
I've been playing Mass Effect 3, a little bit of World of Warcraft.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
I can't think of anything new that I tried this week.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
I went back to a game from a couple years ago, just because.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
I just had an itch to play it, and that's New Super Mario Brothers Wii.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I don't know, I just never finished it years ago.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I got really close and never finished it years and years ago.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
So I just went back and played it a little bit, and I was like,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Oh, it's actually a pretty good Mario game.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
I forgot how much of the Mario universe, not to be confused with the game,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
they kind of brought into this game.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
So, you know, the fact that there's Yoshi and Fire Flowers and Ice Flowers.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
But anyway, it's an old game.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
Either you've played it by now or you haven't, or you're waiting for the next one on Wii U.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Like, I'm sure Loki is with great anticipation.

33:44.000 --> 33:49.000
So, I promised a little while ago we could talk about a game that I've been playing

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
that I didn't tell a lot of people that I was going to go play.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Because it just kind of happened.

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
I've been having the codes sitting in my Steam account for probably about a year now.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
Because Alan trolled me when he used to hear me talk about this game an awful lot.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
And he said, Oh look, it's on sale on Steam right now for just like $9.99.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
I'm going to buy these codes for you, just to kind of troll you a little bit.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
It was, you know, when we were, the finances were better and all that stuff and we could, you know,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
throw $10 at each other to troll each other with stuff.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
But I never used it. I'm like, I'm too busy playing these other games.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I'm not going to go back and play this game.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
I don't have the time to sink into this crap because this game is such a time sink.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
I don't have time for it.

34:33.000 --> 34:40.000
But then last week, Shane and I were getting around to talking about the expansion pack for Final Fantasy XI.

34:40.000 --> 34:45.000
And I realized, Oh, I have those codes I never did use that Alan got me on Steam.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
What the hell? I'm going to just roll a brand new character.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
I'm going to go back into the game and see what's changed.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
So I've played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI this week.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
And I got to tell you, yes, a lot has changed.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
The game is drastically different.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Let me put this into perspective.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
Loki, I know you played Final Fantasy XI for a long time, so I know you'll be able to speak this language.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
You ready?

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
Do you know what I accomplished in three days of light gameplay on Final Fantasy XI?

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
No. What did you accomplish?

35:16.000 --> 35:22.000
I am level 25 white mage with a black mage sub job already leveled.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
And I did the sub job quest.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
That's pretty awesome.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
It might have been over three days, but you and Nikhletov have been playing a lot in the last three days.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
So don't say casually in an hour you gained five levels.

35:36.000 --> 35:41.000
It hasn't been, well, yes. Once we figured out what we were doing, yes, it has been that fast.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
I guess the thing is now, one of the things that was implemented in the game that changed things drastically

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
is they put in these things called field manuals, which are these books that sit out in the open.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
And you do what's called page burning.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
You take a page and it'll say, kill six worms.

35:56.000 --> 36:04.000
So you go out, you kill six worms, and you get bonus XP and you get bonus gil once every real world hour.

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
I'm sorry, you get the bonus XP every time.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
You get bonus gil and this other thing called tabs once every real world hour,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
so that way you can't just be getting it and getting it.

36:13.000 --> 36:21.000
So what people do now is one of the zones, Gusk and Mines, one of the book burns is kill six skeletons.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
So people go into parties there at level 10 and book burn over and over and over,

36:26.000 --> 36:33.000
just pull skeletons over and over in alliances of 18 people just pulling these skeletons over and over

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
and level, level, level, level, level, level.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
You're just gaining levels that fast.

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
And apparently you do it in Gusk and Mines, you do it in Crawler's Nest,

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
you do it in one of the dungeons and you're all the way to 75 in a couple days.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.000
That's what, like, the leveling game is gone in Final Fantasy XI.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
It's just you sit there and collect XP.

36:53.000 --> 36:58.000
People go AFK and just sit there and collect the XP because the skeletons are that easy to kill,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
yet you still get the XP.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Here's the thing that concerns me.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
I see the look on Loki's face and he's going, oh, really?

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
No, I'm just, it kind of ruins, what's the point then?

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
I mean, why bother getting, you know, good armor and stuff like that?

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
You don't. It's all, because now it's all about the end game.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
They went Guild Wars in their design.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
They made it so that, oh, getting to max level is easy.

37:21.000 --> 37:25.000
It's all about the end game now and getting you to end game is not a problem.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
Because the end game is still hard and you've got crafting and all that stuff, right?

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
Crafting's still a bitch. As I'm finding out, making money's still a pain in the ass and all this stuff.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
But the leveling game, now it takes no time at all to be max level.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
You do still have to do, from what I understand, the limit break quest.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Oh, I hate those.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
But now that the level cap is 99, then people are getting there no problem.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
Just get a couple 99s to run you through all the limit break quests, you're done.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
I still hate that, though.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Yeah, I know. It is kind of annoying.

37:50.000 --> 37:55.000
So, a sitting vampire in chat says, yeah, but there is a cooldown for those book quests, right?

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
No. There isn't.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
You get the XP every time.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
Six skeletons, XP.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Six more, XP.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
Six more, XP.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
You get the gil and the tabs once an hour.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
That just makes me think of that Eddie Izzard sketch.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Uh-huh.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
You have crossed a bridge, champagne!

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
You have entered a shop, champagne!

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
You've left a shop, champagne!

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
You have fallen into a ditch, junk, champagne!

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
There actually is a zone called Sarah McGue Champagne.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
I just made a Final Fantasy XI joke.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm done with that game.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Anyhow.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Alright, so anyway, that's...

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Oh my god, something just popped into my head.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
What?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
A Mass Effect MMO.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Wouldn't it be awesome?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
It would, but...

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Bioware, do it!

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
Bioware did the Star Trek MMO and it's having issues, so they've got to clear those up first.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Could I play an Elcor monk?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
That would be great.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Anywhere. Anyway.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
That's really it.

38:52.000 --> 38:57.000
I'm going to try to do some more writing for VoG and kind of write my thoughts a little bit more and put some screenshots up there.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
So, you know, you guys have an idea of what's going on.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
But, um, I was...

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
You know, and I've had a couple people in chat saying,

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
You should go back and try it. You should go back and try it. A lot's changed.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
Alright, so I finally went back.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
I was slow in doing it. It's like Jamie playing Mass Effect finally.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Took me a little while, but now that I'm doing it, yeah, I'm enjoying it.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
Am I going to leave WoW for it?

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
No.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
The only reason this is catching on right now is because there's not a lot to do in WoW right now.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
But once the panda people hit,

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I'll probably be saying bye-bye to Final Fantasy XI.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
A lot of it is really about the people.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And I just don't know people in Final Fantasy XI.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Druid guild.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
We need a druid guild knight.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Alright, let me know when.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Anyhow.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
I would not play a turian.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
But I would romance a turian.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Answering Tigerclaw.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
I would play a Drell.

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Ragenator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
Although I haven't played it in years, I used to love Final Fantasy XI.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
It has changed a lot.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
And I guess in some ways for the better, in some ways not for the better.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
So.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Anyhow.

39:56.000 --> 40:00.000
That was my experiences with Final Fantasy XI and my gaming week.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Alright.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Let's move on.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Housekeeping tonight.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
I want to talk a little bit about something new on VoG Network.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
First off, thank you to everybody.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
The full website has been launched for 30 days now.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And I can't believe it's only been a month.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Because it feels like it's kind of been a lot longer than that.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
But maybe I'm thinking about the temporary site we had and all that.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
But the first month of VoG Network has been very successful.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Bobby wrote a whole little summary with number crunching like mad over at VoG Network.com.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.000
You can kind of look at that story and see exactly how many posts were commented on.

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
And how many people clicked the like button and all that good stuff.

40:36.000 --> 40:44.000
Well, one feature that has been demanded time and time again is now becoming a reality starting today.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
The porn channel.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
No, not the porn channel.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Maybe in August.

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
But for now, the podcast check-in feature is now going to be live.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Now, I want to make this clear.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
For now, it's being tested.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
We're calling July a test phase.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
So, it's only available on certain VoG shows.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
It's only available on Bobby Black Wolf, our show.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
And it will be available next week on Understation Live.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.000
That's it for right now.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
But in the future, hopefully it will work.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
And we'll be able to roll it out to more shows in the future.

41:14.000 --> 41:22.000
How the podcast check-ins work is that at some point throughout the show,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
and it's never going to be in the same place because we know how people like to work the system,

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
at some point during the show, you will hear a little prerecorded message.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
And you know what?

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
For the podcast listeners, I'm going to make tonight's very, very easy.

41:35.000 --> 41:41.000
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VoGnetwork.com,

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
use the pass phrase, zone.

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
Now, for the live listeners, you didn't get to hear anything right there because this is for the podcast.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
This is something they're going to have because you get to check into the shows when they're live.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
But for the podcast, for whatever that word was that you just heard,

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
you're going to go to VoGnetwork.com and you're going to put that word right there underneath the leaderboard.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.000
And you'll be able to check into the show, get the same amount of points that the live listeners get for listening live.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
Because the point is, live podcast, you're participating.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
We still love you either way.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
So we want you to get the points either way.

42:12.000 --> 42:18.000
Now, if you listen live and you check in on the podcast, you're not going to get the points twice.

42:18.000 --> 42:24.000
Sorry, we just thought that would be too much of an unfair advantage to the individuals that have the time for both.

42:24.000 --> 42:29.000
But you might want to still consider doing it anyway if you do happen to listen to both,

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
or you listen to part of one and go back and listen to the podcast later.

42:32.000 --> 42:39.000
I would encourage you to do it because it's still being tracked in case one day there is show specific loot.

42:39.000 --> 42:46.000
For example, we might give you some loot if you check into the podcast and the live show three weeks in a row or something like that.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
I don't know. Hypothetical, we haven't designed any of that yet.

42:49.000 --> 42:59.000
So there you go. That is now a feature that is available to you guys at VoGnetwork.com, podcast check-ins.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
I'm trying to make sure if I'm forgetting anything. I don't think so.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
I think, again, it could be at any point throughout the show.

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
I'm not going to explain it every week. If you want more of an explanation, one is available at VoGnetwork.com.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
Right next to the little box where you put in the password to check in is a little thing that says, what's this?

43:17.000 --> 43:25.000
And Bobby Blackwolf wrote a great little summary on the website at VoGnetwork.com.

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
And if you're listening live and you have no idea what the hell this is all about, you're missing your chance, buddy, to collect some points and maybe some loot.

43:32.000 --> 43:40.000
Go to VoGnetwork.com, register for the site, and whenever we're live, as we are right now, you're going to see a link that says right there on the front page on the left side,

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
participate now and get points. And you go and you get points for checking into the show. Super easy.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
Okay. I think that's that. Let's move on with some gaming news.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
I need to throw this out there, though. Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, Google Plus, search for Orange Lounge Radio.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
There you go. Let's get into some actual gaming news. Loki.

44:05.000 --> 44:14.000
So, let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And the Wii U, Nintendo has already come out and said, hey, you know what?

44:14.000 --> 44:21.000
The Wii U, it's not going to be this really expensive system. It's going to have a reasonable price.

44:21.000 --> 44:35.000
And basically, Satoru Iwata, he said that the initial price point of the 3DS was considered relatively high by consumers and that they won't make the same mistake with the Wii U.

44:35.000 --> 44:43.000
So, I don't know. What do you think? I was privy to a little something.

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
Is this Secret Club? Do we need to say don't tell other people this, that you heard it here?

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
I don't know. I think I've covered my...

44:52.000 --> 45:00.000
Alright, let's go ahead and just make sure, if you're going to tell other people this big piece of information Loki's about to share, you didn't hear it here.

45:00.000 --> 45:12.000
Well, some of this is, what, what do you mean? So, when I, the Wii U, I think is a reasonable price. It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.

45:12.000 --> 45:21.000
There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with. What's in those SKUs? No idea. What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.

45:21.000 --> 45:28.000
So, the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99. So, there's that.

45:28.000 --> 45:34.000
The next price up, $299.99 and then $349.99 are the three different price points.

45:34.000 --> 45:40.000
Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely speculative. I don't know for a fact this is what it is.

45:40.000 --> 45:47.000
$249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
So, system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now. You have all the Wii remotes and nunchucks.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Go on the online shop and enjoy.

45:55.000 --> 46:03.000
Yeah, nunchucks. Done. There you go. You've got a system. You're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.

46:03.000 --> 46:13.000
$299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then an additional Wii remote plus and a nunchuck.

46:13.000 --> 46:16.000
Kind of like the Wii had.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
I bet it's going to be that other controller, the Xbox controller. They'll throw that in.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
You give yours and then I'll give mine. Never mind. I'll shut up.

46:25.000 --> 46:35.000
And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the gamepad controller, the Wii remote plus, the nunchuck, and another pack-in game.

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land. It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
Alright, here's my guess. I could be completely wrong. I'm going to throw it out there.

46:47.000 --> 46:57.000
$249.99, bare bones system. $299, that's the one that's going to come, bare bones system, Classic Controller Pro, or whatever that thing is called, and Nintendo Land.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
I say you get the pack-in game at $299.

47:00.000 --> 47:08.000
$349 will be, it will still have Nintendo Land, but it will not have the Classic Controller Pro.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Instead, it's going to have two Wii U tablets for all the games that don't use them.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
$700 bucks, blow up Miyamoto doll.

47:14.000 --> 47:23.000
Honestly, I do not think they're launching a system with two gamepads, because there's no games that support it, and people will be like, it won't sell.

47:23.000 --> 47:31.000
That may come later on when they have games that support two gamepads, but right now, it's absolutely useless to do that, which is why they're not going to do that.

47:31.000 --> 47:50.000
Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September, but there are the price points, release date is probably going to be the 18th of November, so hey, you figured it out two months before they're going to actually announce it.

47:50.000 --> 47:56.000
So that's that. I think it's somewhat reasonable.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
Yeah, actually $249 is kind of lower than what I thought, but...

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
I'm not going to get one still, but it's...

48:02.000 --> 48:09.000
Has Nintendo launched with multiple SKUs like that since the original NES, which also came in three SKUs, funny enough?

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
Um, I don't think so.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
So, no.

48:15.000 --> 48:25.000
And that's all I know of right now, is that they've got three price points, because that's what they want projections on, unless they're shopping price points and saying, okay, how many of this one are we going to sell?

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
I don't think that they're like, we don't know what the charge for this.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
$349 is way too much, I think, for the system to be out right now.

48:32.000 --> 48:44.000
The thing that's going to be interesting, though, is that gives Microsoft and Sony enough time to where I think they could drop their console price again by the time that comes out, and $249 would not be that much of a stretch.

48:44.000 --> 48:55.000
That's another $50 price point, or $50... I think it's another $50 drop, or are they $199,299? I can't remember right now. They may be $199,299.

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
Or, it could be onboard storage, like, you know, this system has more storage than this system.

49:01.000 --> 49:05.000
Although, I mean, I wouldn't pay $50 more for onboard storage.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
The Apple approach?

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
I don't know if they're going to do that, but...

49:10.000 --> 49:25.000
Interesting. I don't know. We'll find out soon enough what they're going to be throwing in there, and when it will be available, but we have a pretty good hunch of what might be in there and when it might be available.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Did you talk about the online part yet?

49:27.000 --> 49:35.000
Nope. Online is going to be free, and thank God, too, because like we've seen so far, we have no fucking clue what they're doing online.

49:35.000 --> 49:47.000
So, yeah. Free sounds good. I mean, because honestly, I haven't seen anything offered on it that was anything more than what's on the Wii, aside from, hey, now you can put forum posts on games and stuff.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
You know, which... hooray? I don't know.

49:51.000 --> 50:01.000
Do you think they might go the route that PlayStation Plus went, where, yeah, it's free, but maybe if you do give us money, we'll give you little freebies?

50:01.000 --> 50:07.000
Because certainly there's enough of a back catalog of virtual console crap that they could give that shit out like candy.

50:07.000 --> 50:14.000
Um, they could do that, but I don't think that they're organized well enough to do that right now. That may be something that comes way later on. I just think they're too late to...

50:14.000 --> 50:24.000
Something is not in the show world tonight. I know they made a major hire this week with somebody from Disney Studios is, like, in charge of their online now.

50:24.000 --> 50:36.000
Disney had that unique thing that they did a while back where it was DGamer or something like that. Um, it was kind of like their, like, online hub thing. They had, you know, avatars and stuff like that.

50:36.000 --> 50:46.000
And it was tied in with, like, their DS Disney games, which probably no one remembers any of that stuff. But, um, that was kind of cool, and the offerings that they had in there were pretty cool.

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
But I got... I hope they don't go that route because it was really stupid.

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
Doesn't Disney also have some fairly popular online games, like Club Penguin, I know is a pretty big deal.

50:58.000 --> 51:08.000
And then, like, Pirates of the Caribbean. Like, I know their games are really big on having the phrases already there, and you can only pick from those phrases to communicate with.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Like, you can't type in your own stuff. They used to keep it safe.

51:12.000 --> 51:25.000
I... cool. I just, you know... I... once again, it's... I don't want to have this so, like, chopped off of the balls, I guess. You know, where it's...

51:25.000 --> 51:35.000
Why would I want to, you know, buy a brand... first off, why am I going to buy a brand new system that basically is, you know, as graphically powerful as my current Xbox 360?

51:35.000 --> 51:42.000
Yeah, it may edge it out a little bit, but I don't think they're going to be really utilizing that. I don't think you're going to see games on a Wii U right now.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000
They're going to be like, wow, that looks so much better than the Xbox 360 version. You're not going to see that.

51:47.000 --> 52:07.000
ActDeft brings up another good point in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. It says, Where's My Water is pretty awesome. And that's right, that reminded me, I forgot, Disney does have a pretty big footprint in the iHouse app universe right now as well. You know, with that Nintendo thing being a tablet where you're going to be able to play games on it, that seems like an interesting little connection as well.

52:07.000 --> 52:17.000
Because obviously, Disney has the Where's My Water. They have a couple other games too. I know they own the Tap Tap brand now too. That's all Disney. So...

52:17.000 --> 52:25.000
I just, I don't know. I don't have very high expectations for them. They're also supposed to be in September, they're supposed to be talking about 2013 titles for the Wii U.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Really?

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
Which honestly, I think that's... it's too... it's too early to be talking stuff for next year.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
Is this the parallel Tokyo Game Show conference they own?

52:34.000 --> 52:43.000
It's another one of their five billion press conferences that I don't fucking care about because, like seriously, just get all your shit out at one time, not this.

52:43.000 --> 52:50.000
Well, today we're going to talk about the first three digits of the price and then maybe we'll have another press conference to talk about the last few digits.

52:50.000 --> 52:58.000
And then we're going to give you the day of the week that the system's coming out, this press conference.

52:58.000 --> 53:08.000
And then the next week we'll talk about which month it's coming out, and then maybe the hour or another... I mean, seriously, they waste so much fucking time with this stuff.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
I mean, that's fine. People keep talking about it. They're like, hey, people keep covering our press conferences.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
That's how you do it.

53:16.000 --> 53:24.000
Yeah, but people keep covering it because they're like, wow, you didn't really announce anything. That's fantastic that you didn't announce anything. Very important.

53:24.000 --> 53:33.000
Well, you know, when there's not a lot of gaming news, you know, that's a great time to have a press conference or it's a great time to report on people's Twitter activity.

53:33.000 --> 53:42.000
And that's what I want to talk about here is game director Katsuhiro Harada. He is the director of Tekken.

53:42.000 --> 53:53.000
And he posted a very interesting rant this week on Twitter. Now, I always thought Twitter was restricted to 140 characters, but he wrote a whole little essay on there thanks to...

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
Twitlonger.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Twitlonger.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Or Tweetlonger.

53:56.000 --> 54:06.000
Which apparently is a thing. Twitlonger.com. And he put this whole little rant about people who constantly tell him, switch back to the voice actors used previously.

54:06.000 --> 54:13.000
And I guess he's pretty pissed off about it. He said in this... I'm going to quote some parts of this rant here on Twitlonger.

54:13.000 --> 54:26.000
Quote, the voice you were listening to was 16 years ago during the PlayStation period. The current generation of consoles are totally different in how they play back sound, both software wise and internal circuitry.

54:26.000 --> 54:38.000
Quote, also you're assuming the voice actors themselves can reproduce the voice they recorded 16 years ago. Many voice actors decline work because their voice has changed since the original role.

54:38.000 --> 54:43.000
Some have even retired. Sometimes they won't accept, even if we ask.

54:43.000 --> 54:52.000
Quote, some might just say, just pay them to reuse the voice data, but often the voice actors decline this, or their agency declines.

54:52.000 --> 55:04.000
Quote, Brian's laugh is the actual data from Tekken 3. As fans have requested, we've kept using the original, adapting the data recorded 16 years ago to be used on the PlayStation 2 and then PlayStation 3.

55:04.000 --> 55:12.000
Even so, some people said it is a different voice in Tekken 6 than the original. It can't be helped, they might think that.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
And he goes on to talk about the whole conversion process and so forth.

55:16.000 --> 55:27.000
But I love this. He says at the very end of this, he says, quote, after this lengthy explanation, I will be quite surprised if there are still people who still don't get it.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
Thanks for understanding or not understanding. Whatever.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Bro, you mad? You real mad.

55:33.000 --> 55:42.000
I guess this is starting to get to him. But I can see, I can see where he's annoyed. I can see where the fandom is like, don't change it. It's perfect. Don't change it.

55:42.000 --> 55:52.000
I like Tekken 6 sucks. I want Tekken 1. I want the voice from Tekken 1. But he does make a good point. You have to license those voices every time. And sometimes they say no.

55:52.000 --> 56:01.000
Voice actors can step out on a green light to cross the street and get hit by a bus. What are you going to do? People die. I mean, what do they want? You have to find a replacement sometimes.

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
And honestly, if you like the voice acting better in Tekken 2, go play Tekken 2.

56:07.000 --> 56:14.000
That's a good point. But I think the problem is too many people are playing Tekken 2 and not enough are playing Tekken 6.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Tekken 3 was the best.

56:16.000 --> 56:25.000
Oh wait, here's another great quote. I have even complied to the request of you all spamming me to bring back characters from previous installments.

56:25.000 --> 56:32.000
You often say, let's show the dev team how sincere we are by buying two copies if they bring back character X.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
But did you really go through with it, expecting you to at least pre-order the game? I was met with more spam.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
After you apparently didn't notice that June and Michelle actually returned.

56:43.000 --> 56:50.000
I still have some characters left to be revealed that will comply with some of your requests, even bringing back several others.

56:50.000 --> 56:57.000
Even so, none of them are paid DLC. I will continue to sincerely comply with fan requests.

56:57.000 --> 57:07.000
However, I can't continue to engage the negative ones that, without knowing what you are talking about or even thinking about when you're saying blindly repeat, bring back, bring back, bring back.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
He's like, shut up. Am I not doing enough? Are you people not happy?

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
As the magical sunglasses float from above and land on his face.

57:15.000 --> 57:23.000
Seriously, that is seriously like the Twitter equivalent of, deal with it. This guy rocks.

57:23.000 --> 57:28.000
I kind of wish more people would tell off their fan bases.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
That rant kind of makes you want to give Tekken 6 another chance, because we did try playing it and it was kind of poopy. I didn't care for it.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
Five or six. Wasn't it six? I guess. I don't know. It was six. I've lost count. It was six.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
I mean, it had to be a game fly for a day, but yeah, it was probably six.

57:46.000 --> 57:53.000
Anyway. Alright, let's move on with some other news. DarkSakura, we need to stop reporting on Twitter activity.

57:53.000 --> 58:01.000
Okay, well, if it's any surprise, this is about Mass Effect 3. Which no one's surprised, especially Rob, because he gave me the story.

58:01.000 --> 58:02.000
Thank you.

58:02.000 --> 58:11.000
Yeah, the Extended Cut DLC was out and everybody is happy. Well, okay, not everyone's happy. There's still some people who are like, meh.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
Which I had to stop myself from watching it, even though I watched some of it.

58:18.000 --> 58:24.000
Okay, so going forward, they're actually talking about already doing more download content that they're working on right now.

58:24.000 --> 58:37.000
So, it was teased in a tweet that in regards to more download content, it said, that's a trick question, we'll save the future DLC for future chats.

58:37.000 --> 58:41.000
Don't worry though, there's much more.

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
Mass Effect 2 had a DLC cycle that was a year and a half, because Arrival came out I think March or April of 2011.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.000
I think so.

58:49.000 --> 58:55.000
And it was a 2010 game, Mass Effect 2. So, yeah, they need to, you know, DLC for the multiplayer would be nice.

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
And then what happens to Omega with Aria, and there's definitely campaigns they can add.

59:01.000 --> 59:09.000
Well, I really hope the Omega thing. I'd love to see more Aria. I really hope they got Carrie Ann Moss to do additional dialogue so they can do that. That would be great.

59:09.000 --> 59:25.000
Well, given that I've only done a little bit in Mass Effect 2 of going to Omega, yeah. So anyway, I kind of, I mean, I won't have much more of an opinion until I get into Mass Effect 3.

59:25.000 --> 59:29.000
But there's little side characters that I kind of liked that I wouldn't mind.

59:29.000 --> 59:39.000
I'm all about extending the game's life with DLC. In fact, I'm kind of sad that we haven't seen DLC really yet, except, of course, yes, I know the extended cut DLC.

59:39.000 --> 59:49.000
I didn't really get into that during my gaming week, I just realized. I guess I figured most people who wanted to see it, went and got it on Tuesday, and y'all have formed your other opinions already, I'm gonna make it brief.

59:49.000 --> 59:55.000
I've got to keep it spoiler free, because obviously Jamie hasn't got there yet and I don't want to ruin it for her. And neither should you, chat room.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:05.000
I will say this. BioWare said they're not changing the ending, they're gonna just give you further details on the ending they made. That's exactly what they did.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Although I understand they changed one thing.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
There is one, well...

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
They added something.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:27.000
They added a big something, that some people say is a giant F you to the fan base, and I say, deal with it. I thought it was great. And they did change some other things that they got called out by continuity cops.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Yeah, so apparently, Maya, big thing of wondering, this is just what was cleared up for me, that my big thing of wondering, what are all of those Turians gonna eat?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Got fixed.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
So I feel happy about that.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
They made some stuff very clear. Very clear.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Yeah, and as far as them adding details, it was a lot of details, did it? I think it left enough people satisfied that the people that are still, like, furious about it are being brats.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:05.000
But the content that we got on Tuesday should have been in it from day one. It's not that spectacular where we can go, look dipshits, it wasn't that hard. This is good, this should have been in the original product.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:17.000
That's kind of the consensus overall that I'm getting from most people is that I'm happy with this. I wish it had been this way the first time. And if it had been, there probably wouldn't have been as much butthurt, and I'm okay with that.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
For me, it will be in it the first time.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
There you go. And, you know, I think a lot of fans-

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Patience is a virtue.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:37.000
A lot of fans should realize there are a lot of people like Jamie, that still haven't played the entire series, and you know, Mass Effect will continue to kind of grow in the fans and so forth. I will say this because this isn't really a spoiler.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.000
One thing I noticed they did add at the very, very, very end after the credits and after everything is they put a little pop up message that says, you know, thank you for playing Mass Effect.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000
We really appreciate all your feedback and your comment, you know, kind of the PC thing they have to say over the years, and we hope you've enjoyed Mass Effect 3.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:09.000
We can't wait to, you know, see you for whatever Mass Effect has in store next type of thing. So they do basically say this is not the last Mass Effect. They don't say Mass Effect 4, but they basically say there'll be more.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Like I said, the whole ending would be to be continued with DLC.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:26.000
No, I don't think it's that. I think that the DLC is going to go back and add more content, like exactly how they did with Mass Effect 2. All of it is stuff that happens before the end of the game.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And one of them is a really big, the Arrival thing is a really big, big thing from what I understand.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Well, Arrival is also truly a bridge between 2 and 3, and it was the very last 3 starts immediately referencing what happens to Shepard and Arrival.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.000
That's what I had heard. And so that's why I thought, OK, that's good. I mean, it's all stuff that ties right back in. So I'm pretty I'm pretty happy.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I mean, I get to play through Mass Effect 3 with the true ending. I mean, in my head.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You'll never experience that hurt.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Keep in mind that a lot of it got some of it got spoiled for me.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I'm going to punch you so you can experience some of the hurt.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000
That's OK, Rob. I'm not being punched.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Vandy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, referencing something you brought up earlier, Mass Effect MMO. Who knows?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I would quit WoW in a second for a Mass Effect MMO.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I don't think it's in the cards for BioWare after what's happened to Star Wars. I mean, if Star Wars can somehow be salvaged, maybe.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But it should just be converted into Mass Effect MMO.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.000
No, no, it should not. They can do better, even better.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Well, I meant take the base engine and fudge with it some.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
All right. Let's move on. More gaming news. Loki.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000
All right. So let's talk a little bit about the future. And this is kind of cool.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Mercury Steam, the team behind the Lords of Shadows game.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Yeah, it's part of Castlevania because, you know, they didn't think it could stand on its own.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:18.000
They're ready to basically call it, well, move on from the Castlevania franchise after the new 3DS game and Lords of Shadow 2.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:28.000
They said, we think it's, well, I think it's about wanting to leave a legacy and I don't want to be in charge of a series that perhaps over a certain time is going to decline.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I'd rather go out with a bang and leave our legacy in the Castlevania universe.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And then, of course, you know, they also said they don't want to be known as Mr. Castlevania.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And, you know, should Lords of Shadow 2 be very successful, they'd have another team do a sequel.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Of course, they were teasing that perhaps Contra is the next series that they will work on.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
That'd be pretty cool. New Contra game.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I'd like to see Contra make a comeback.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Contra should make a comeback.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:06.000
But it's one of those games, like, it could easily be so fucked up. Like, they could really botch it bad.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
But, I mean, you know.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
What was it? Was it Contra?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Would they call it on the Xbox Live Arcade one, the anime?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Oh, Hardcore Uprising.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Yeah, Hardcore Uprising.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
That was pretty rad. I like that one.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So, even though that wasn't really Contra, but it was?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Hell yeah.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I mean, Hardcore Uprising is basically Contra.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I think it did have some of the music.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
So, anyway.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:40.000
If you like that anime-style look to Hardcore Uprising and some of those other online games, maybe you are an anime fan.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
And maybe you'll be excited to hear that Viz Media is launching a subscription-based service called Neon Alley.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And it's going to be on consoles this fall.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
It's a 24-hour anime network.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Viz Media is the localization company that did stuff like Bleach, Naruto, and a lot of similar things.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah, they've taken it way back. They did Ranma.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Yeah, so they brought all that stateside.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
They've already said it's going to cost $6.99 a month.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It will not be an on-demand streaming app, which I find kind of strange because people are paying for it, but I guess they're taking the HBO approach.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:24.000
It will be an actual TV channel with schedules and all that stuff, uncensored content, HD, but it will always be dubbed in English.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I don't care anymore.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
This is the other thing.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:39.000
There will be advertisements, even though there is a subscription fee, the ads will be limited and they're there to keep the cost below $10.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Some of the programming coming to the channel, Naruto Shippuden, Inuyasha, The Final Act, Death Note, those are all coming to this network.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:03.000
But they don't say exactly what consoles or how, but I guess we're left to assume it would be very easy for it to be a PlayStation 3 app akin to the Netflix or Hulu Plus or Vudu or any of that stuff.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And then we have on the Xbox 360, obviously those content channels are very easy to make and we've seen a lot of those, so it will be a Comcast-esque style channel.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Still very interesting because I can't think of any other on-demand channel that's run like an old-school TV network that's only available on a game console.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Very interesting. Interesting to see what could be in the future.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You know what, I'm still going to stick with fansubs.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Would you pay $6.99 a month for VOG TV?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Well, yeah, because we're far superior. And we'll play it in Japanese, I don't care.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I know you would think if it's all online it would be super easy to just have one channel in English and one in Japanese. That seems, you know, eh, that's weird.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Kind of like Laserdisc, play it in digital or analog.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Exactly, I think.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Alan, I know you're in anime, in fact you know way more about it than I do.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I used to be.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:14.000
He used to be. Okay, just the other day, I'm telling this on air, we were at a Sanrio store and there was a Sailor Moon backpack and you pointed at it.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Yeah, because it reminds me of when I was 17 and not quite out yet, but clearly gay and Sailor Moon was awesome. It's pretty.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
You know what, we should just marathon the entire thing from beginning to end.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I need to convert my awesome fansubs of the last three seasons I have on tape to something digital.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I've got rips of them. Yeah, Rob.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Would you pay $6.99 a month for this anime TV with commercials in English only?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Given that I haven't really watched anime with any type of seriousness in like 10 years, no, but from 98 to about 2003, fuck yeah.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I just remembered what the last series I actually paid to have shipped to me from fansubs was on tape.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It was Mamata Shugogeten.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Was it worth it?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Well, I had watched a lot of it raw because a friend of mine taped some off the TV for me and then I watched most of it and then it came out in the US and I was like, well, crap.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I hardly ever watch anime. I think the last one I watched, seriously, was it was a vampire, was it Helsing?

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Helsing, maybe.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I think it was the last one I watched.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And we watched that over at Jessica's Old Place after watching Shock Treatment.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Yeah, that sounds about right.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:43.000
With the projector that Evan had hooked up. I remember that. But like, I used to, I have boxes of laser discs.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
You know what we need to do? Have an anime convention, but like not restricted to anime.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
We need to just have a convention where it's like, everybody just fucking show up here and we're going to do awesome things.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
And if you don't like it, get the fuck out.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You know what? I take that back. You know what the last series I actually downloaded everything was?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Supernatural.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
There's a Supernatural anime.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And it's done by Studio Madhouse.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And I watched, no, it's like a whole season of stuff.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And the X-Men one, which was really good because I think that was also Madhouse.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
But anyway.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
GTFO Con. If you don't like it, GTFO.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But be proud of me. Be either proud or sad for me.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I broke out my Gatchaman episodes from 1972 and was like singing along with it because I will always sing along with the Gatchaman theme.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
The last anime I guess I watched were all those Gatchaman commercials that Nintendo had after their last 3DS conference in Japan.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
What the hell was that?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I downloaded all the ones that that internet provider did in Japan that were live action with S.M.O.P.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
For anyone who doesn't know, S.M.O.P. is the Japanese version of Minuto.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, next news story.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And then release dates, a couple more news stories.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And then the classic game of the week, which is a real good one tonight.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Well there's a game that's been announced for PC, but it was originally a smartphone game.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It's called Death Rally.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It just has the best name ever.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000
So it's being rebuilt for the PC with a new engine, camera, new controls.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Well of course it's going to be a new control since it was a phone game before.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And it's going to have a new track and the Shadow Man from the 1996 version.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So you should see it on Steam for 10 bucks.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
So if anyone wants Death Rally, it's on Steam.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000
And it actually looks pretty neat, you know, because it's cars and blowing up stuff.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And it was developed in Finland, where everybody is happy and has universal healthcare.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates coming to a country near you.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Possibly Finnish release dates, we might cover that in a minute.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.000
But first, the U.S.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Did you know that's true though?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
As far as international happiness level, Finland was rated number one.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
There is not much coming out this week.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
What did you just do to Dark Sakura to make her squee like that, Alan?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I brought out one of my awesome Sailor Moon, Sailor Stars fansub tapes.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Look at how awesome those are.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It's got a laser print sticker on the tape too, you should open it.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000
To the radio listeners, it probably sounded like you grabbed her boob.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Alan, don't do that.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
This is awesome. Very cool.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
We had Fushigi Yugi like this for a while, back in the day.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Every episode of Fushigi Yugi.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Alright, so, sorry, we were with release dates.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Loki, not Jack and Shit.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Not much. It's literally Jack and Shit.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I don't know which one you're going to consider Jack or Shit, here we go.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
The Secret World, which is a new MMO being launched, that's coming out on PC.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
That looked interesting, that can be the Jack.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And then, Theater-Rhythm Final Fantasy for the 3DS.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
You know, it looks like shit, but everybody that's played it has really enjoyed it.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Somebody came on here and said that was their favorite game from PAX East.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
So, maybe it's one of those looks can be deceiving things.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
That's out this week, huh? I might have to pick that up.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
There's no demo for that or anything?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There might be, I'm not sure. I mean, there's a Kingdom Hearts demo.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000
There's a Kingdom Hearts demo because I finally recharged my DS so I could download that.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I would think that there would be a demo for that.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Rhythm Thief has a demo, but I don't think Theater-Rhythm does.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Hm, I don't know.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Chatters, what do you think? Which of those games sounds more exciting?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Secret World or Theater-Rhythm? I want to know. Live.vognetwork.com.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Meanwhile, Japanese release dates. Let's talk what's happening over there.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
July 5th, a little more exciting in Japan.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Xbox 360. Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon gets a price reduction.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Max Anarchy is the new game from Sega coming out on the 360.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And there's also Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier comes out in Japan as well.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Yeah, I really wish it was coming out over here. Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns over here.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I was going to say, it's Anarchy Reigns, right?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Yeah, it got delayed next year.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Oh, wow. Really? So, you're going to have to import it, I guess, if you want to play it.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
No, I'm not.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Because it is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Which, as you know, PS3 is region-free, so if you really wanted to play it, you could.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Other games out on the PS3 this week. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Tactical Assault Commander 3 gets a price reduction.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Or it's, I guess, the camouflage version. Oh, no, that's $129. That's not a price reduction.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I don't know what that is. Oh, this is a... Never mind. You know what that is?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000
American... It's one of those little MechWarrior mouse slash number pad slash draw...

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
It's one of these things. Look. It's one of those. It's not a game.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.000
It's a peripheral that has the mouse. But it's for the PS3, which is interesting.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So, it's definitely for more tactical-based strategy games.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Batman, Arkham Asylum, and Arkham City get price reductions in Japan this week,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000
as they are released into the PS3, the best collection.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Looking at the handhelds here real quick, on the Vita, you have a game called

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Dokuro comes out this week. I do not know...

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I'm trying to think what this game is over here.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I thought I saw a preview for this, and I can't think of what this is called over here.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I've seen this somewhere. Yeah.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Let me see if these screenshots look familiar to you.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
It's on the Vita. This is Dokuro.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I thought I saw this in one of the PS3 conferences, and it looked interesting to me.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Looks interesting. Looks like a little bit of a side-scroller.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Kind of has a gothic-esque theme to it.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Looks a little bit like the Nightmare Before Christmas.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Lastly, on the 3DS this week, there are some more peripherals,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:00.000
but as far as games go, we have Sekaiju no Meikyu 4 Denshu no Kaioshin

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000
comes out this week, and that is...

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:10.000
a game where you make your own character and set up a team of explorers

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
and go through labyrinths. Hey, Rob, it's an anime.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Is it? Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Thank you. Dokuro means skull.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Maybe that's why it looks familiar. I've seen a cartoon version or something on YouTube.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Lastly, on the 3DS this week, Danball Senkai Baku Boost

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
comes out this week from level 5. I believe it's...

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I think it means skull.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
This is another one of those mech knights type of fighting games.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
There you go. Let's travel to the UK.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
On the 3rd, the Secret World. And on the 4th, Rainbow Moon,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
which makes me now think of Sailor Moon. Thank you, Alan.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000
On the 6th, we have Beat the Beat Rhythm Paradise,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends, and Theater Rhythm Final Fantasy.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
That's it.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Some feedback on the release dates from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Stan says, I want to play Max Anarchy. Bayonetta's in it.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
S is the guy from Madworld.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
He's one of the main characters in it.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
In fact, I think a lot of the characters from Madworld are in there.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I want to say a lot of the villains are.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It looks interesting.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Why isn't Bayonetta 2 already a thing that came out in Japan last year?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
That's a great question. Why is that not a thing?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It's because a developer probably wants to make it, but I don't think it was profitable.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I mean, it was somewhat profitable, but it's still a niche title,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
but I think that they totally would do that.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Because it's the guy who left Capcom Platinum Games.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It's his studio that made it, and they're working on something else big now.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Metal Gear Rising.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000
That would be a distraction.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Probably preventing a Bayonetta 2.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Unless Bayonetta is a secret character in Metal Gear Rising.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Let's fucking hope. For real.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
You know, actually, the guy from Madworld would be a good character for that,

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
because since it's all the cutting stuff, you could get him in there with his chainsaw arm.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Nice.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Alright, a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But first, Loki.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
So, you know, I really hate it when there's an awesome game coming out,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
and then it's all fucking buggy, Bethesda.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So, Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC just came out this week,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
and apparently it is really buggy.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:40.000
A bunch of the PC users have kind of gathered on the Ubisoft forums

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
and made a bug report for them.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Letting them know, you know, what exactly the issues are.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And, you know, apparently it ranges from everything that, you know,

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:03.000
the mouse doesn't work to some other minor things.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I don't know. It's just kind of bad, I guess.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I don't know. I'm not much of a PC player.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I would have thought, though, they took the extra time to get the PC version right.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
I mean, because this game came out back in May,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
and the PC version not until, you know, the end of June.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And so now they just kind of, eh.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I don't know.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Test your shit. I mean, seriously.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
They literally have broken it down.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
They've broken it down.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
The hardware compatibility, input FPS resolution, graphic issues in game,

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
online, audio menus, and other.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Why is it that these companies treat gamers like they're beta testers

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
and not like they're fucking, you know, customers?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I mean, that's stupid.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Oh, shit.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
We pre-order anyway.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
We didn't know those tires fell off of the car.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I mean, if we had driven it, we would have surely noticed that that was the case.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Your steering wheel only turns to the left?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Well, that's unfortunate.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
You know, thankfully our track, you know, we turned to the left.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And so, yeah.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Huh.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Well, now we talked a little bit before about anime.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
And I might not be the biggest anime fan in the world.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I mean, it's all right.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But one thing I do love is I love the stuff that comes from Miyazaki and all that stuff.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So you know I'm looking forward to Ni no Kuni, which is the,

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
or I guess that's already out in Japan, actually.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
But the English translation is coming out finally soon.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And in Europe, there is going to be a Wizards edition that comes out.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And it's going to have a copy of what's called the Wizards Companion,

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
which is the spell book used in game.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
There's a Drippy doll.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
It doesn't actually drip.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Drippy is the little character that comes with it.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You get some other DLC stuff with this.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
And that will be out when the game comes out on January 25th.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And some good news.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
It was announced for North America shortly afterwards.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:14.000
However, you can only get it on Namco's online shop at store.namcobandigames.com.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
It will set you back $99.99.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
But I got to say, looks pretty awesome.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
I'm really looking forward to this game.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So that's one I'll be playing early next year for sure.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Ni no Kuni.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I think I'm sort of past that phase where I'm buying special editions of just about everything.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Yeah, me too.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And I hate the DLC stuff.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I think my burn phase was when I bought the Cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Paid 90 bucks for a plate and a clock and a fork and a spoon.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000
And a pillowcase.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:51.000
I mean if the collector's edition is $10 more or $20 maybe tops and it's a series I really love, then maybe.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
But you are asking me to take a big risk here on Ni no Kuni.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Sometimes those collector's editions kind of bomb too.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Like the Tron video game.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I see those collector's editions still on clearance.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
It's been almost a year and a half since the movie and the game.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
So people are still trying to unload those collector's editions.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Even popular ones like Halo Reach and stuff.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
That's true.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
A ton of those.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Yeah.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Alright.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Well, let's go back to a time when things were simpler.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000
We didn't have $400 collector's editions of games or games that come with leather jackets which I think was a thing a couple weeks ago.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
A time when games were classic.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You bought the $50 game and if you didn't like it the way it was out of the box then F you.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Or when you would go around from store to store so that you could get the Killer Instinct CD.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And sometimes these games that you would buy would be hard as hell too.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
And I think that's a very important thing to state.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And God, I hope you were good.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Ninja Gaiden for the NES.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Specifically, the NES version.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
It's hard as fuck.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
In Japan it was called Ninja Ryukenden which is Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And in Europe it was Shadow Warriors because there was this big taboo about using the word ninja.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
For example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles over there.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
There you go. I know my stuff.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.000
So it was a little platformer where you beat people up and chopped them in half with your sword.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And it was ported to the PC Engine.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Actually, let me start back.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It came out in December 1988 in Japan, March 1989 in North America, and September 1991 in Europe.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.000
There was a PC Engine version in 1992 and a Super NES version as part of the Ninja Gaiden trilogy in 1995.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And there's been mobile phone versions with episodic content.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And it's now on the Virtual Console as of 2007.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So you play as Ryu Hayabusa, who we might also know from Dead or Alive and the current Ninja Gaiden games.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So he's learned that someone named the Jockio plans to take control of the world by using demon power.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
So you have to go through all the different acts and you have 20 levels.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And it's hard. Hard, hard, hard, hard.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:34.000
More than that, the big thing is that it had such an elaborate story and used cinematic cut scenes as far as an 8-bit system could handle.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Which were epic as fuck at the time. Seriously.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And it even had a novelization done in...

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Oh, it was one of the FX9 books, wasn't it?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yeah, the Worlds of Power-ness.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Oh, that's right!

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And he actually kind of had something to write off of.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000
He had to just make shit up for games like Simon's Quest, where the story for Simon's Quest was really strange.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
But yeah, he actually was able to keep the Ninja Gaiden one pretty close to the cinematics.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
So basically, it's just super hard.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This is a game I haven't eaten.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:18.000
You can use Shuriken, you can use your spiritual strength power.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
You also get Shuriken that work like boomerangs.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You get different types of things that will freeze your enemies.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
The fire wheels. All kinds of neat stuff.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
And even with that, no one can beat it. Sorry, it's impossible.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It just won't happen.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
I know people who have beaten it.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
But I don't think Dan's beaten it.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000
I've gotten to the last fucking stage and there's a jump that is so hard.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It was controller-throwing, rage-inducing.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Alan knows what I'm like when I'm mad.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
That was one of them that made me mad.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000
It's like you would jump.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Actually, if anyone wants to see the best rendition of how every gamer feels playing this game,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000
look at the Angry Video Game Nerd's little video about this game.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That is everybody playing this game.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
My one difficult NES game triumph is that I beat the original Ninja Turtles NES game,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
which also has a rep for being hard as hell.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
You know, it's an American-made game.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I beat that twice and all the other times I couldn't get past the final boss.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
But yeah, ninja-gating is harder than that, so that's some scary shit.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Well, it was developed by Tecmo.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Another series back in the day that Tecmo did was Rygar,

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
which I don't know if I've done on Classic Game before.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Rygar is a pretty good game.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Of course, Tecmo Bowl.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
So this one also had an arcade version that was a beat-em-up,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
but they weren't really ports of each other.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
They were kind of different.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
And the developer said that the term ninja was gaining popularity in North America,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
so that's why they made the game with the ninja in it.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And actually, the NES version was developed by Hideo Yoshizawa,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
who was listed as Sakurazaki in the credits.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.000
So you can see that if you look at the arcade credits and the NES credits,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000
completely different development teams.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So basically, that's where the differences came in with the two versions.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:35.000
So it's just really supposed to be more like you're playing along them,

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
is what they were going for.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:44.000
That you were involved in the story of the game as well as playing the game itself.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So because the game's title was actually too difficult for English audiences,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:55.000
that's why they changed it to Ninja Gaiden.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And they were going to call it Dragon Ninja, but Ninja Gaiden just worked.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
And it actually literally means ninja side story.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
But it's not intended to be a spin-off of the arcade version.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
God, I remember these bosses. Some of them were hard as fuck.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
The first two were easy mode, but then the third one is like, ah!

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Sorry.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
This might surprise some people because I don't really talk about the new games,

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.000
because I'm not nearly into the new games as much as I was the old ones,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
but I loved this old series as a kid.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I had this one, part two. My parents would never buy me part three.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
But I did get from a friend on Super Nintendo, they did a compilation.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Well, this game had so much featuring in Nintendo Power in 89 and 90.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.000
It was on the March-April 89 cover and referenced in Howard and Esther.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I used to read a bunch of Howard and Esther, just saying.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And it was also in the May-June 1989 issue.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.000
It had complete walk-throughs. There was stuff in the counselor's corner.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
It debuted number three in the top 30 list for July and August in 89,

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
just behind Zelda 2 and Super Mario 2.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
You know what they need? Reg and Esther.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
No.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Just saying.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So, I mean, basically, going back from this, in 2004,

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Tecmo did episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for the AT&T and Verizon phones

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
that used the Brew and Java platform.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And the second installment was going to be released in North America,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and it just didn't come out. They didn't keep up with it.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
And you know that magazine that Dan and I are into, Retro Gamer,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
which is a UK magazine, they did a review and a look back on Ninja Gaiden

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.000
in the March 2004 issue, when the 2004 Xbox remake came out.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
So, I mean, this game has really spawned a legacy.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
It gave us, you know, you keep going, and it's given us, like,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
we have characters that are alive.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And going from that, we've got the newer versions, which some are good

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and some are not, and the big, flowing red scarf.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
And there's also soundtracks. You can get the soundtracks.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000
The first one came out in 1989. So, there you go.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, a real classic, Ninja Gaiden.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
On the NES, not to be confused with the arcade version,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
which I personally did not care for nearly as much.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
It was just too different, as you touched on there.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
But I seriously recommend to everybody, when we're done with the show,

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
go watch the Angry Video Game Nerds version of this.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
And then play Ninja Gaiden.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And then play it.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
And play the sequel.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And then scream.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And play the third one.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Because the second one introduces the Shadow Ninjas,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
which weren't in the first one.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I would like to see how bloody knuckles, you know, people get

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
from punching the wall while playing this game.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Yeah. AcidicVampire in our chatroom says,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Heard the most recent Ninja Gaiden is shit.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Yeah, that's what I heard, too.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I tried not to get into the new series as much, but I hear they're hard, too.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Is the latest one three or two?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I think it's three.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Okay.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Yeah, because each one got released, like, three times with the Black Omega Ultra Hyper Edition.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Sigma, yeah.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Yeah, so.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Well, I remember it was a big deal because it was on Xbox One.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
The first Xbox first.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Yeah.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
It was a big deal.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break so we can, you know,

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
do break-type things, like refill our drinks and all that stuff.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
But don't go anywhere.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
There is plenty more to go when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
We're going to have the FUGO Question of the Week, of course.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Your tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And you know what?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Last week, we didn't get to do any of our big segments because we were busy celebrating with the ten years and everything.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
So I think we should play a game tonight.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
So we're going to do listless tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Stay tuned.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:08.000
We are live on this Sunday night, July the 1st of 2012, with the 463rd episode of our show, taping live at vognetwork.com.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
If you're just now joining us live, well, hello.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Come on by the chat room and say hi at live.vognetwork.com.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:21.000
And if you're listening on the podcast, I hope you didn't fall asleep when I was talking about podcast check-ins earlier

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
because now you can get vog points just for visiting vognetwork.com.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Log it in and put in your password.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You might get some loot. You might.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
But we don't give away all the secrets on how to do that.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here and the FUGL question of the week and all that good stuff.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.000
But first, Alan, you're here on the show tonight, and I always like to let the guests plug things.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I know you don't run a website of your own or anything, but you do have something you do want to plug tonight, yes?

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Yes, I'm selling off more video games, eBay batch.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:58.000
So I was selling off duplicates. Now I'm selling off stuff that was once, you know,

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.000
normally something I wouldn't part with, but make some extra money.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
No one's obligated to bid on it, but I thought the O.L. Army might want to see what I have up for grabs.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I'm going to put a link in chat.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Excellent.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
So eBay games.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
What kind of stuff are you selling, just to kind of give the impression?

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Almost entirely handheld stuff. Game Boy Advance is the bulk of it.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Am I not coming through on audio?

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:26.000
No, it's just the chat room. Sometimes you guys send me mixed signals because and you guys in studio don't.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.000
You're like a psycho girlfriend.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I don't want to sound mean, but don't always take what chat says at face value.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Multiple people have to say it before it's an issue.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And then when you guys get in on it, because one person is saying it in chat, I get really confused.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Two people have to say it in chat before it's really an issue because, like, I don't know.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
I can only see the little waveforms going here so I could tell Alan's mic was off.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And I'm sorry, I ran away to turn on a light somewhere else so I didn't see that his stuff wasn't getting through.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yeah, Rob.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But anyway, now we got it. So I just totally ruined your plug.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000
But that's what I do. I ruin your life. That's my role.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
So how do people find your auctions?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000
There's a link in chat right now. It's a goog.goal link.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
And also if you check the OLR Twitter feed, I don't know if you RT'd it, retweeted it.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000
But if you check the Orange Sounds Radio Twitter feed and just scroll down if you're a podcast listener listening to this,

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
they end Thursday nights. You've got four days.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I didn't retweet it on OLR because I was like, ooh, I shouldn't use the business thing for that.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
But it was on my personal Twitter. I just retweeted it at twitter.com slash SKIE.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Yeah, so check Sky's Twitter. It should be a couple of posts down.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Okay, awesome.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And do we get some of the games named already? Sorry, I got confused with it.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Do we get some of the games that you are selling?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
I haven't listed any of them off, but let me do that real quick.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I wish you had told me about some of these first.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I would have just given you straight up cash.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Final Fantasy 5 and 6, Game Boy Advance.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Those are the ones that have extra maps and espers and job classes.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Advance Wars 1 and 2, bundled together.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Four Swords, Game Boy Advance.

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Final Fantasy 3 DS, Final Fantasy 2 PSP, Final Fantasy 4 DS, Elite Beat Agents,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Super Smash Brothers Melee GameCube, and Final Fantasy Legend 3 for Game Boy.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
That game is 20 years old.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
I didn't tell you to name them all. God damn, I'm just kidding. It's fine.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
All right, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
RDGSinge says, do we get a discount if we mention OLR at the eBay checkout?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
No, and I have to make very clear, this money is going to Alan.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
This money is not going to OLR.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Yeah, this is not some vog fundraiser. This is me just selling games.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
But he can plug his stuff because he's sitting here on the show tonight.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
However, I will say this, if you do mention OLR at checkout,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
we will throw in something small.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Like, we'll throw in something from the OLR vault here.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Just a something small little trinket.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Maybe an autographed picture of myself.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I'll give you something better than that.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I'm a vampire to know that Final Fantasy VI is super awesome,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
but I'm never going to play at Game Boy Advance again,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
and Final Fantasy VI is available four other different ways.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Plus, I have a Super Nintendo sitting right over there,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and I'm pretty sure there's a Final Fantasy III cartridge somewhere,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
which is a pretty decent way to play it.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000
I realize it has the wrong number in front, but you know what? Deal.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news stories tonight. Loki.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
This shouldn't come as much of a surprise since we were just talking about

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000
all the trouble with the PC version of Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.000
But yeah, Ghost Recon Arctic Strike, which was going to be the expansion

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
for Future Soldier, has been delayed.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It's not coming out this week like it was going to.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
They're citing polish as the reason to hold it up.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Yes, the polish or, hey, let's not release it with a million bugs,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
like with the PC version.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So, got out of the way.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
There's a new LEGO MMO coming.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Hopefully this one will last a little longer than the last one.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And it is coming from Funcom, so they kind of know their way around an MMO.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
And they haven't really said exactly what this MMO is going to be,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:22.000
but they have some LEGO minifigs online,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
and it's going to be based on that franchise.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I didn't realize they had so many different LEGO minifigs.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:34.000
They actually have one with bunny ears and stuff and little red riding hood.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:37.000
It's kind of crazy.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:44.000
So yeah, family-friendly game, and it's going to be coming out at some point.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
LEGO minifigs.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Well, since it didn't work the last time.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And then last but not least, there is a big action movie coming out this summer,

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000
and it doesn't feature Batman, but it features a whole ton of 80s action stars,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000
including Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff like that.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000
The Expendables 2, and it is coming out as a video game,

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
which was kind of leaked out before.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
I think it was on the German's rating board and stuff like that.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
But it is going to be a PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade game and PC game

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
coming out probably around the time of the movie.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.000
It's a four-player co-op shooter, and I don't know, it looks neat.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I'm trying to see if this is more of like a...

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I think this might be like an arcade-type game, you know?

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Like a Time Crisis or something like that.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000
And obviously it's based on the movie, which I saw the trailer for not that long ago.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
It's not like Time Crisis, but it's...

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Man, it reminds me of the Nam game that they had on Neo Geo,

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
where you have your character run across the screen.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It's sort of a shooter, but not.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Do you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character?

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
I don't know if you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Seriously, fuck that guy.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Okay...

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I don't like Chuck Norris. I don't. I think he's a fucking asshole.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
But that's my personal opinion. I'm allowed to voice it.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
He will hunt you down.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Fuck him! I'll take him on. He's like 70 years old.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Go break a hip.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I would never actually threaten physical violence against someone, disclaimer.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Alright, let's move on with some other news.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Valve...

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
You want to make some more in-game movies, things in Team Fortress 2,

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
which, by the way, after last week, where I was like,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
oh, I want to play some more first-person shooters and stuff,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I'm probably getting more recommendations for Team Fortress 2 than anything else,

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
just so you guys know.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
So I probably will have to check that out at some point.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:46.000
But anyway, Team Fortress 2 is one of the games that you can make movies with

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.000
now with the Valve Source Filmmaker.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I guess one of the videos they were showing off was this Meet the Pyro video.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
I haven't watched this myself yet.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:00.000
But the Filmmaker can make a movie out of any game that's running on the Source engine.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
So the Source movie maker uses the same assets as the game and all this stuff.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
So it's like you don't actually have to play the game to make movies

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000
based off of the characters and all that.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
It's Machinima's wet dream.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I can only imagine the fear that's in my heart

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000
hearing that they have this and Garry's Mod

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
combined together into one pure evil cinematic adventure.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Half-Life 3 trailer, right?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
There's a ton of...

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Not to bring up Mass Effect again,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
but people have ported the Mass Effect skins or the bodies into Garry's Mod.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
So there are Mass Effect cartoons on YouTube made with Garry's Mod.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
So anyhow, you can sign up for the Filmmaker beta

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
at www.sourcefilmmaker.com.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
And I guess right now it's only really Team Fortress 2,

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
but I'm assuming there will be other games later

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:55.000
and plenty of fake Half-Life 3 trailers to hit the web soon.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Now if you're more of a Portal fan, Jamie,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
maybe this is something that will interest you.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
A Portal turret mini replica.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Don't you want a turret in your house, StarSakura?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
You can get a blow-up turret.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Well, this is not a blow-up.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It is an actual mini model of the Aperture Sentry turret.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It's a 16-inch tall.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
This company, Gaming Heads, is only making 350 of them.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
You can pre-order it right now for release in Quarter 4 of 2012

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
for the low, low price of $330.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Rough, excuse me, $325.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
So it's full-size, yes.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Yeah.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Not 60 inches, sorry.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
I would just make one.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I've made one in Maya.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I've rendered one in 3D.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
So, yeah, I don't know if it will actually shoot guns,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
but apparently it does have a sound module

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
that plays the activation search, auto search, disabled,

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
and all those sound effects.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Just trying to get to that baby.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Your funeral.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
And lastly, some people are very excited about this MMO.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
It's Guild Wars 2, and I gotta admit, I'm pretty curious.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
I want to check it out.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
The launch date has been announced.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Get ready to lose sleep the night of Tuesday, August 28th.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
That is the day that Guild Wars 2 is launching.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.000
The next and final beta weekend event is planned for July 20th through 22nd

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
if you want another little sneak peek,

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000
although I do believe you have to have pre-ordered the game to be in the beta,

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
but you never know.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
You might have a friend or something that can show the game to you.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Tuesday, August 28th is the day that that launches.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Well, you know how there was that whole thing,

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.000
the kusu that got the Minecraft Lego set made?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
There's Portal 1 now.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
It's got GLaDOS' chamber, the modular testing chamber with turrets,

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
cubes, portal gun, and more.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
So you can go to lego.kusu.c-u-u-s-o-o.com.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Kusu, whatever.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I won't want to say kusu because that's Japanese for shit.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Slash idea slash view slash 18258 pound, as in the pound symbol.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Then Gunlord for Dreamcast.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Yes, there's still Dreamcast games being made,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and you can get it for 40 bucks or you get a limited edition for 50 bucks.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
It has a dragon box for 120 bucks.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
So yeah, Dreamcast.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I love the Dreamcast shit.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
And then finally, Sony says that their new racing wheel

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
is going to have double the accuracy of a DualShock.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:31.000
And it's kind of a weird spaceship-shaped freaky-ass controller thing

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
that uses the Move.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And that's how they're marketing it.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It's going to be 40 bucks.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Seriously, this thing is fucking weird.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
It uses the Move as well, so if you don't have a Move,

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
you've got to get one of those too.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
If you don't have a Move, you're SOL.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Just don't buy it.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
I mean, seriously, don't buy the steering wheel thing.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Let's be honest.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.000
How many more racing games that are going to utilize that

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.000
are going to come out on the PS3 before the next system comes out?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Probably like one or two.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
I'm linking this ugly-ass thing in the chat room.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
And, Ronma, if you'll please put this on our Tumblr,

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.000
it's just completely hideous.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
All right.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
It looks actually kind of like a really weird sex toy,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
which the Move looks like anyway.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Let's get into the FUGL question of the week.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
It's my vehicle.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Every week, we ask you guys a question on Facebook

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
and the same question on Google+.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Put them together, and you get FUGL.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
That's why we call it the FUGL question of the week.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And because I can't let this topic go,

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000
the question of the week this week was very simple.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
And the question is, what is a gamer?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And before we had the discussion at the top of the show tonight,

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I wanted to know from the listeners what they thought

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
before you whipped out the dictionary and all that.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
So let's see what the listeners...

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And I purposely left it vague.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000
I just wanted to get a very organic response.

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
So I guess we'll start on Google+,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
because unfortunately we usually have less answers there,

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
because, you know, it's Google+.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
There's not a lot of people on it.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Let's see.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Ooh, we do have two answers.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Ooh, we have three answers on Google+.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Holy shit.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Okay, we're going to read them all.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.000
ActDeft says, a miserable pile of controllers,

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
but enough of that.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Have at you.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Oh, I was hoping we'd get Castlevania jokes.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Seriously speaking, a gamer is someone who plays games,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
whether it's only one game or type of games or many.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
There are different types of gamers, though,

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
like casuals and hardcore gamers.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
But if you play a game and like it

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
and probably invest time and or money in it,

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000
then you're officially a gamer.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Let me be in line with what we were saying earlier.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
Flaco Jones replied and said,

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
anyone who games and is willing to identify themselves as a gamer.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I like that little kind of second twist there,

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
willing to identify themselves as a gamer.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Maybe some folks on Facebook don't want to be gamers.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000
They just want to play their Price is Right slots.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Surtur says, a gamer is someone that includes video games,

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
phone, handheld, PC, and or console

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
as part of their entertainment consumption.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.000
So does that mean like someone who budgets money for games?

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Look at my house, gamer.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000
All right, going to Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Raginator says, a miserable sack of lies.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Oh, there it is, another Castlevania joke.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Oh, wait, never mind. That's the answer to what is a man.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Well, actually, it's a miserable little pile of secrets.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
But anyway, well, in simplest terms,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
a gamer is one who plays games regardless of the form they take.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Video games, CCGs, tabletop, pen and paper, RPGs, et cetera.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Usually, and more often than not,

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000
those that play video games pretty much come to mind first and foremost.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
You know, Raginator reminded me of the Twitter rant

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I wrote on that whole conversation the first time it came up.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
And I said something about,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
this guy has probably never played Dungeons and Dragons second edition.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Come back when you've calculated a THAC0, bitch.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.000
I wanted to get a shirt that says I still know what my THAC0 is.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
They probably make those.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Do you know what it means, Bob?

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
To hit Armor Class Zero.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Yes.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
All right.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Redthehaze says, it's a person who enjoys video games as a hobby.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I won't distinguish between who's hardcore or not,

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
since that's very hipster douche sort of thing

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
that was being done before it was cool.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
It's video games, it's for fun, and we should all get along.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I like his answer.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
It's very hippie and non-hippie at the same time.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Get along or I will fucking kill you.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Kinda. I'm embellishing.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Picaruno says, I'd argue that there's no such thing as a gamer.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It's as redundant a term as breather or eater,

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
since everyone plays some form of game, whether you're aware of it or not.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Unless you're supremely boring.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Unless you play first person shooters, no offense.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I think he's being funny, not serious.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
There's mouth breather, but that's something different.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Porkchop says, obviously, a gamer is someone who plays games,

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
but to go all Mr. Miyagi.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
A gamer has the ability to disconnect from reality,

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
to travel to other worlds.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Whether it be to solve puzzles, explore uncharted lands,

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
or battle formidable foes,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
a gamer can become one with their environment

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
and achieve greatness through hard work and dedication among their peers.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Or something like that.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Somehow I just thought at the end of that statement there,

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.000
it should be, and enjoy a book at your local library.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
It's like, something like that.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
It was a very zen answer.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
It was very, like, then you see the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
taking a big poof off the hookah.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Anyway.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Speaking, just to derail the show for a second.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Sure.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
One of the things on Kotaku they like doing

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
is posting the really bad stock footage of gamers.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And one of them had this nerdy chick on a couch

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000
playing a game, really weird,

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
laying face first off the couch,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and her friend is smoking a hookah that's not lit.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I just thought that was, like, why even have that?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Why would there need to be stock?

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
I need a picture of a nerdy girl sitting awkwardly on a couch

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
while her friend smokes a hookah.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I need this now as stock footage.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
They're high on life, Loki.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
I'm still in my way. I need that.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Wicked replies and says,

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Great musical, by the way. Thank you for commenting.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I feel that a gamer is someone who plays games,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
regardless of genre, platform, or even method.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I would consider people who are avid board game players gamers.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:39.000
They play games just like someone who plays World of Warcraft is a gamer.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
If it's an activity you enjoy, it doesn't matter the medium you enjoy it in.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
A gamer covers lots of ground,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
and the only true definition is someone who plays games.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Oh, excuse me, I have two more.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Tigerclaw says,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
A gamer is a person who plays not just video games,

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
but all sorts of games, be it board games, the pen and paper,

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
role-playing games, or card games.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Lastly, Chiggers says,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Here's the real short answer, one who games.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I think we can all accept that answer.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Thank you, everybody, for listening.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Well, thanks for listening, sure,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.000
but thanks for responding as well on Facebook and Plus.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Participating is the big word we use at VoG Network, yes, participating.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But contributing, too.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Stop giving me the death stare.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Why are you giving me the death stare?

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I'm not giving you the death stare.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
You are giving me a little bit of death stare.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Hey, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
What?

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Garrus.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Loki.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Well, that's like a new thing.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:39.000
The first ten years were rah, rah, rah, rah, what?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
The second ten years will be Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Garrus.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Teehee.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Loki.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000
So, apparently, Hollywood's next big idea to bring to theaters,

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
since they're adapting all sorts of properties,

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:01.000
be it board game and movie title or comic book or, you know,

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I don't know, all these reboots and stuff,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
now they're going to bring back Carmen Sandiego.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
As in, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Your journey into geography.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
You know a story like this is just begging for it.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
It is.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
It's just begging for it.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
It is.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
It's begging for it.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
One, two, three.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Yeah.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Move up, move it, move it.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Is there really any movie needed?

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I don't want to hear the dubstep version of this, though.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
No, nothing beats-

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Actually, that would be kind of funny.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But, yes, they're planning on-

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
No, we need to have a serious moment.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
This is a, for real, serious moment.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
I don't care if you have to blow all five of these men to get this to happen.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.000
This movie is null and void if that song is not in it.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Can we all agree on that?

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
It's playing in the credits.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
I mean, that credits is fine.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
You know, like, doesn't even have to be the first or second song in the credits,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
like the last song in the credits or second to last or-

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Just have Carmen Sandiego be in New York City

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
and these guys standing on the street-

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
There's a hilarious cameo they could do.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
No, she shows up in Disneyland and it's the Dapper dance.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Yes, fine.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I don't care how you do it and I don't care if these guys have aged 20 years,

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
get a new Rockapella.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
If they can keep doing Menudo over and over, then they can do new Rockapella.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
I agree with SSJ100Matt.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Rockapella needs to be on standby at all times.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Here's the weird thing, though, about it, though,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
is it sounds like this is going to be based on-

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Granted, it's been a very long time since I played the PC game.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I don't remember if you were also a-

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I think, weren't you part of the ACME agency or something like that?

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Yes.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Because she was part of the ACME agency

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.000
and then she turned to Life of Grime or something like that.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
She went rogue.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
She went rogue.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Was there really a fucking backstory to Carmen Sandiego?

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Yes, there apparently was.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I thought it was just like, we gotta capture this bitch.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Like, that was really-

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
The old versions of the game, it's like, why are we looking for her?

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
She's bad. Get her.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
So-

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
There was a whole story.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
There was a cartoon series and the cartoon series wasn't bad, I thought.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I played the crap out of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000
But anyways, the story, it's being penned by Darren Lemke,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
who did Shrek Forever After and Jack the Giant Killer,

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I guess that's coming out soon.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Sounds great.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.000
And then, of course, the movie involves Carmen Sandiego,

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
who's turned from the greatest detective to an infamous criminal,

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
and then her former colleagues try to hunt her down and she-

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
they uncover a conspiracy and question whether Carmen is really a thief

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
or a hero, which is stupid.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:58.000
And then, on top of that, you know, I think they were saying that,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:04.000
oh god, Jennifer Lopez is being targeted as the person to play Carmen Sandiego,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000
and Angelina Jolie. Really, it needs to be Angelina Jolie.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I think that she looks the part.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And Angelina Jolie would go topless.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Which, you know, there's nothing wrong with a little gratuitous nudity.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Now, I do believe that they're trying to make it a family-

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
She's naked under that red trench coat.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
In my head, she always was naked under that red trench coat.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Now, I believe that they're trying to make it a little family-friendly,

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
but I would be down for the topless, uncut edition.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Unrated, you know, family-friendly, or full-on big-breasted nudity.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Sounds wonderful to me.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Yeah, so I look forward to the success of this movie,

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
and hopefully, you know, the Oregon Trail movie and Number Munchers the movie.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
So, yeah.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Hollywood is really out of ideas.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
I think that's what we've come down to, is that they're out of ideas.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
You know what's sad, though?

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.000
There was one essential character in the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego TV show.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Oh, you're not going to be able to hear this.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000
It's very quiet on this movie here, but it's the Chief,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
if you can hear that in the background.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Remember the Chief?

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
She was great.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
She was great, and she was a character in the video games that they had and everything,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.000
but unfortunately, that actress, Lynn Thigpen, she passed away a couple years ago.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
So, unfortunately, they would have to put somebody new in her role,

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
or somebody old in her role.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Perhaps somebody from the Sim City series

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000
that could maybe do some news reporting or something like that.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Yeah, but that wasn't a sassy black woman.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I don't care. It's still all right.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
It could be Samuel L. Jackson, a sassy black man.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Although, since race isn't an issue, if you want to talk about somebody old,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Betty White would make a great Chief.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Oh, I don't care. Just run her over with a truck.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Or one chick from the community.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000
She's a sassy black woman that could play the role.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I think it'd work.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Or what's her name from Reno 9-1-1?

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
She could... maybe.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Wanda Sykes, because, God, she can't be in more annoying roles out there.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.000
As the Chief.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Wanda Sykes is the Chief.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Oh, man, we probably should have done the list list tonight.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Sassy black woman you would have liked to have had as the Chief,

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
but unfortunately we have a different topic tonight.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000
That's a little specific.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Anyway, I was going to get the...

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Old edutainment game that needs to become a movie.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Kathy Griffin, because she identifies as a strong black woman.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Turtle, the movie.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Vandy has a great one. Medea as the Chief.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
All right, and since you all brought it up,

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
here's one actress who could be the new Chief from Sin City Action News.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Carol Davenport, here with a special report.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Tornado, big city, big hit.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Curse, trailer, the city animal park.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
God, forget it.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Lord Partly, my hair is ruined and I said to her, yes, you're dead.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.000
She literally just disappeared off the face of the earth.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
She's a great actress.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I mean, you know somebody was just standing there off camera

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
with a tornado blowing it in her face,

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
and she was doing all that acting for the tornado.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
It was just brava, brava, Carol Davenport, brava.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
And you know, back when I was kind of toying out the idea of FMV actors,

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
where are they now?

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
She is not easy to find.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
She isn't. I tried to find her too.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000
That's the interview I want more than any other.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Find me. Find her and bring her to me.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:04.000
J100 Matt says he's still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And Tiger Call recommended Zoe Saldana for Carmen Sandiego,

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
and that woman needs to eat some tacos.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I like her, though.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
She needs to eat something.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
I love her in Star Trek.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
Well, yeah, but she still needs to eat.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Uhura had some back, sorry.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:23.000
All right, moving on.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
We're going to go topless wearing the world's Carmen Sandiego.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I'd even be fine with Mila Kunis doing the role.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I would pay to see that.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000
She is a gamer, isn't she?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
She would be familiar with the subject material.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:40.000
And they've done fake topless with her, but it's time.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.000
It's time in your career to elevate it to the next plateau.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I mean, let's go.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.000
If Halle Berry could go topless and win an Oscar to say in.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
How would you work a topless scene in a Carmen Sandiego?

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I would even be fine with Halle Berry doing topless chief, you know.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
She could be a sassy black woman.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:01.000
For me, I see Halle Berry's not very sassy to me.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
I always picture monsters ball.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I don't know.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And then storm.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
But anyway.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.000
No, Natalie Portman would not make Carmen Sandiego, sorry.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Here's how you work a topless scene in the Carmen Sandiego movie.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Is that she's hiding out in Monaco at the beach.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Because I think that was a scene in, what was that movie with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo that was basically James Bond, but it wasn't.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
It was, um.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I'm not James Bond.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
It was a remake of an older movie. Somebody in chat will yell it out.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:39.000
But you had to have seen this movie because, I mean, Rene Russo was like 50 years old, you know, and she looked great.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.000
And she had no problem doing the nude sunbathing scene on the beach.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And even, you know, again, I've said this before.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I'm very secure in my homosexuality.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
But I can appreciate a nice pair of tits.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
She had a great rack.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.000
She's just, I mean, come on, if Holly Berry's taking it off in Swordfish.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Swordfish! I mean, a movie that really didn't need that.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
But she did it.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Thank you! Acidic Vampire, The Thomas Crown Affair. That was it.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Uh.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Member?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Alright.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Anyhow.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
What are you snickering at over there, Darcy?

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Oh, one of my friends posted one of those demotivational posters of two midgets getting into a fight.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
And it says, I have a feeling this is going to be a short fight.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
No.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Stop.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Alright.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Well, somebody thought this company would be a lot more short-lived than they really were.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
But they've lasted a long time.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
And it's Atari.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Atari is celebrating 40 years this week.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Or they did this past week.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I didn't realize their birthday was the day after mine.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
But it is.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.000
40 years ago was when Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney got together and founded Atari.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.000
At the time, it was CIGI.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
I guess that's what they wanted to call it.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
But they couldn't get that name.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So they went with Atari.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Great runner-up.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
So yeah, that's awesome.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
40 year anniversary for Atari.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
And yeah, they did a little infographic.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
1972 is when it was founded.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
That's when Pong came out.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Breakout was 76.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.000
The original Atari 2600 or the Atari VCS, 1977.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.000
Let's see.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Of course, they don't mention the big video game crash in here.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Oh no, they do.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
1983.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Revenues dropped 97%.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Later on, the Atari greatest hits on the iPad.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Which, by the way, on the 40th anniversary, they just made all the games free.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
So I actually played.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I didn't talk about it in my gaming week.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Because, like, LOL, Atari 2600.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
But I played, like, Combat 2.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I played Sword Quest.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Which was an amazing...

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
There was a Combat 2?

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
It was a prototype that was never actually released.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And it's in that iPad one.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Is it any good?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
No.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Well, on the iPad, no.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
But if it had come out many years ago, yes.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Because, like, it's different.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Like, the terrain is different.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
There's trees, which is different colored blocks that you can shoot through.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
And it just, it kind of has a more natural look.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Kind of like River Raid.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:08.000
But combat.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Like, if that makes any sense at all.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
So, yes, Atari is 40 years old.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:15.000
And I thought, you know, to celebrate Atari's birthday,

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:19.000
maybe we could throw them a listless party!

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.000
That's right.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.000
We're going to play listless, which we haven't done in a few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:33.000
So let me explain how listless works with you guys.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000
We are going to be coming up with the definitive list.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
And it's a highly scientific process we go through.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000
First, let me give you the topic.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Tonight's topic is,

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:51.000
What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Because, let's be real, Atari slipped a little bit over the years.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Did any of you play Driver 3?

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Did anybody actually own a Jaguar, besides Dark Sakura?

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
No, I haven't owned a Jaguar.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Really?

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Because the only two games that were good on it, I actually own on Sega Saturn.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:14.000
So anyhow, we want to do a topic, What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
What we're going to do, each of us will go around here in studio,

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:21.000
myself, Loki, Dark Sakura, and special guest Alan tonight,

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
and we're going to give our top three answers.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And that's going to leave us with a list of 12.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
And then the hard part, it's not fun, but science isn't easy, you guys.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
It's not easy.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
So we're going to have to go around and each person will take one item off the list.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
That leaves us with a list of eight that those of you in our chat room,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
live at live.vognetwork.com, can vote on to make the definitive list.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Now if you guys have suggestions, yell them out in our chat room,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:52.000
because if one of our hosts decides they suddenly don't like one of the answers they wrote down before the show,

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.000
or one of the answers gets duplicated, or they simply like your answer better,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:00.000
then they will use it and hopefully give you credit.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Unless they just happen to have wrote the same thing down already,

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:06.000
because I see one of my answers already got written down in chat.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
So we'll see what happens.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Oops.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
It would help if I didn't leave the chat room.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000
All right.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I'm an idiot.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Okay.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Let's start the list.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
Of course, I can't start the list until I open up WordPad.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
There we go.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
All right.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Let's start off the list.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Alan, you're the guest tonight, so you'll start us off.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Alan, your number three option.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000
How could Atari be relevant today like it was 1982?

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Combat as a Facebook game with real money microtransactions to rotate more than once a day.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
I get it.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.000
So like the little turret in line with a true Facebook game.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.000
You have to turn once a day, but if you want to turn more, it's going to be like 50 cents.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Otherwise you'll be shooting to the right forever.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
It's like a broken arcade game from 1982 where you can't move left anymore.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:57.000
That's how it's going to play.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Bring combat to Facebook.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Bring combat to Facebook.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Didn't Atari actually bring some of their games to Facebook?

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
I think they might have, but Combat I don't believe was one of them.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So the answer stands.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Dark Sakura.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.000
We'll let ladies go next.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Your number three answer.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Atari presents Pizza Time Theater the game.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.000
I see.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Wasn't Chuck E. Cheese a one-time Pizza Time Theater?

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
No additional.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I see.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
So what would happen in Pizza Time Theater the game?

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
You'd vomit.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
And you'd have to shoot the animatronics or the pizza gun.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Do the animatronics go bad at night?

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:36.000
And then you'd have to run away from the employees and hide in the pole position machine so they don't give you out.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
All right.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Let's see.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Stupid helicopter.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I'll go next.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I'll let Loki go last.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.000
My answer for the thing that they could do.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Garrus 2600 is my answer.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:56.000
It would just be a brand new Atari 2600 game that is Garrus' face.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
And that's all it mouths things to you.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
And then that horrible, horrible 2600 chip.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
So Garrus 2600.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.000
All right, Loki, your number three answer for how could Atari be relevant today?

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Marvel Madness 2.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Oh, a serious answer for Loki.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
That's a good one.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
That's a damn good answer.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Maybe a new Marvel Madness game.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
It's awesome.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Well, sure, we did get Super Monkey Ball, but that's not right.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Not even close.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Marvel Madness 2.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:26.000
All right.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000
So, so far, we have combat on Facebook, Pizza Time Theater, the game, Garrus 2600, and Marvel Madness 2.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Let's go to the number two answers.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Alan?

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
You're setting something up in chat right now.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
What is this?

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I don't have the best relationship with chat when it comes to list lists.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I have a bad habit of eliminating their favorite answers.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:50.000
So they want to lynch me and I'm trying to tell them that if they message me, that won't happen.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
All right, fair enough.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Okay, your number two answer.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition for Steam, XBLA, and iOS.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
And how would Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition work?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Just meows and she'd bounce around in his little suit.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Instead of going boop, boop, it goes meow, meow.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.000
So it would be meow, meow, meow.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000
And the little Pong thing would leave Rainbow Trails.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Perfect, right?

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Yeah.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
President Cat.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000
All right.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Loki, or excuse me, Dark Sakura.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Your number two answer.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Working 5200 controllers.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Working 5200 controllers.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:41.000
If anyone has ever owned one or more Atari 5200, you know the controllers are shit.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:47.000
And even aftermarket controllers are kind of shit, if they just had real 5200 controllers

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:55.000
that you didn't have to hold a screwdriver to the contact to get it to hit start on your damn game,

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
then maybe the 5200 might have lived longer.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Maybe it might have caught on.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Because it has the best home version of Kix ever.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Can you tell that this is a sore point?

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Maybe a little bit, just a little bit.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
All right, my answer is kind of similar to what we already heard, but it's what I wrote down.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
I'm running with it.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:17.000
I said remake ET as a PlayStation Network Xbox Live Arcade game.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I had ET the extraterrestrial 30 year anniversary HD remake pre-order bonus via GameStop exclusive.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I was going to say remake Yars' Revenge, and then I was like, oh, wait, they actually did that.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And, well, yeah, we're sitting here now.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:41.000
So I say ET, it was just misunderstood if they would just have made it a little more difficult

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
to fall in those fucking holes.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I played the hell out of that game, and I was seven, and children are stupid.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
ET was not that bad.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000
There were far worse games on the 2600, Pac-Man being one of them, excuse me.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:07.000
That game was shit.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:10.000
All right, at least ET had that cool neck thing.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
All right, Loki, your number two answer.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.000
My number two answer would be a sequel to Adventure in the Style of Skyrim.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Yeah, it's like Atari has the most generic fucking name for an RPG ever.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:33.000
They own that trademark, unless they sold it years ago, which is possible,

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
but they could make a sequel to Adventure.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Because remember, there was adventure.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
That's true.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Wasn't there a prototype for Adventure 2?

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I want to say I've heard of one somewhere.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
I think maybe.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
I think there was.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
No.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Well, what they need is they need adventure with blood.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Like, when you kill those dragons, I want to feel it.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I want that shit that's in the Dawnguard expansion where swords go through heads

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:04.000
and all that stuff and all that crazy, violent stuff from Skyrim.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Adventure with violence.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Okay, number one answer time.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Adventure 2 is on the 5200, and it was a proto.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:18.000
So I'm not crazy, but it was 5200, which far less people own than the 2600.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I've got two of them.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Give me one.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Alan, your number one answer for how could Atari be relevant like it was 1982?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
It was originally going to be the ET1, but that's yours now.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
So I'm going to say finish what Custer's Revenge started

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:41.000
and find a way to break into the adult entertainment industry.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000
You know, I think there's a hint of realness to that answer

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:48.000
because it's like the one place that no one else would dare to go.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
But Atari could have a future in pornography,

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
except maybe it could be less racist next time.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
That should have been my number three answer because it's more silly,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
but I was pressed for an idea.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
That's interesting.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Did you get that one from Chad, or did you make that up?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
I made it up.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Good job.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
All right, Dark Soccer, your number one pick.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
You know this one because I said it before we even started this.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.000
A new console, the Atari 1090.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Why 1090?

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I don't know.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
It sounds good.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
We had the 7800 and I was going to do the 1080, but I don't know.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:28.000
You've got ten extra points of definition.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.000
It's 1090 points of awesome Atari.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:37.000
So all those blocks will be super sharp and not too pickley.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:41.000
All right, my number one answer for how could Atari be relevant

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000
like it was in 1982, more Tempest 2000.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Yes, yes, I agree with that, Rob.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
More Tempest 2000.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
You know what, you should recharge my super zapper.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Yeah, they did Tempest 3000.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Yes, I do.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:00.000
That was supposed to be on the Jaguar.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
I played it at Atari Party two years ago.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Nice.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Freaking awesome.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
But we need more Tempest 2000.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Heck yeah.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
It wasn't on 2600, it was on the Jaguar.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And the Sega Saturn.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
And then Tempest X was the PlayStation version.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000
And it had the most awesome soundtrack that ever awesomeed.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I'll play you a clip later.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Seriously.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I'll play you a clip later.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
All right, but first we have to get the last answer.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Loki's number one answer.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Loki?

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
A combat MMO done in the style of 2600,

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
but you know, since they've got planes and tanks and stuff like that,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.000
imagine armies of tanks and planes and stuff like that

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
fighting each other.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Kind of like the big open warfare that they have in Battlefield 3

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.000
or something like that, but you know, with really like 4-bit tanks.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000
I love it.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
I love it.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Combat the MMO.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Sure.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I had to shorten it, sorry.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000
All right, so let's recap the list before we get to the eliminations.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Combat as a Facebook game to rotate more than once a day.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I don't know why I wrote it that way, but that's what it says.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Pizza Time Theater, the game.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Garrus 2600.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Marvel Madness 2.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
A working 5200 controller.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Remake ET as a PSNX PLA game.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Sequel to adventure a la Skyrim.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
A new console, the Atari 1090.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.000
More Tempest 2000 or Combat the MMO.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
This is a tricky one.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
These are all really good answers.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to eliminate one, but it's got to happen.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
It's part of the process.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.000
So, Allen, we start with you.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Oh, boy.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Let's see if I can do this without chat wanting to kill me.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:14:02.000
I'm going to say Pizza Time Theater, the game, because I don't know what that is.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Oh, it's Chuck E. Cheese.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000
But it is removed from the list.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
It's a hard one.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Well, Dark Soccer, you can get Revenge right here and take one of his off,

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
but maybe you'll find one you want more.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Actually, Rob, I'm going to say Garrus 2600.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.000
What?

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Because I don't want anything to mar my Mass Effect prettiness by pixelating it.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Sorry.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Garrus 2600.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I like my high-res Garrus.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Fine. Garrus 2600 is stricken from the list.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I'm going to remove Combat as a Facebook game because we kind of have two answers involving combat,

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:51.000
and I think Artari is kind of already on Facebook and they suck, so that's not going to save them.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
It is stricken from the list.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Sorry.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Allen.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Oh, he already removed.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Never mind.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Loki, your turn then.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
The Atari 1090 because I don't know what the hell that is.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
You don't understand where the extra 10 is.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I don't know.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:15.000
All I see it as is a lot less powerful than the 2600.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
All right.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
That could be bad.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I think I have an extra zero.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Sorry.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
This half of the screen is black.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
This half of the screen is white.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Oh, wait, they switched.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Something's happening.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:30.000
All right, it is stricken from the list.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
So here we go.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
This is what I'm going to post into chat.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
You're going to send a private message to Sky in chat if you're listening live.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Type slash MSG space SKIE space your number one and number two answers.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:45.000
We will tally them up.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Here we go.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Marble Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, Working 5200 controllers,

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Remake ET is a PSNX BLA game, Sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming,

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
More Tempest 2000 or Combat the MMO.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
There it is.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.000
We're going to tally up your votes and we will read the answers a little later in the show.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:14.000
First, let me read some of the answers that the chatters came up with here.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:19.000
Frisbee says bring back those sword quest games with the contest they had in them.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
That was epic stuff.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I was debating suggesting a finally put out the last two Earth Quest, Water Quest, Fire Quest games.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Because they only put out the first two and then the system went under.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:35.000
The third is available on some of the retro collections like on the iPhone one as like a retro or a prototype type thing.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.000
So you can play the third one but the fourth one doesn't exist.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
For real.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So let's see.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Moving on.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Let's see.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Tiger Claw says remake Pac-Man 2600 with better graphics.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Well that would be Pac-Man.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Legend of Zaku says ET remake with new super secret level where ET and Elliot recover the surplus codes or surplus copies from the New Mexico landfill where they lie today.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
That's a good answer.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Better yet, the cartridges come back as zombies.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.000
They rise from the grave.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Rise from your grave.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
ET kill.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Hey, here's a bit of trivia for you.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
What?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000
ET's design was based off of a hairless, earless cat.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Really?

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Yes, really.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I remember back in the day watching an HBO special with my mother and they showed how the sketches of a cat and then it was naked and everything.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Well it does explain how he had so much control over Elliot then.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Although I don't remember him coughing up any hairballs.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Because he was naked.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
He didn't lick himself.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
But he could have licked other people.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Alright.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Let's get back into the news.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Dark Soccer, I think we left off with one of your stories.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
You did? I forgot.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Yeah.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000
How about something about Yu Suzuki?

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Okay, sure.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.000
He's announced a smartphone game called Gan Gan Pirates.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Yay.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:09.000
It's a pirate themed arcade style shoot-em-up that is also competitive and cooperative multiplayer.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
And it will be free to play.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Launches in Japan for iOS and Android in September.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:18.000
And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and get it over here too.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
But nothing quite yet.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Who knows?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Gan Gan Pirates.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Is this a game you want to play?

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
If it's Yu Suzuki, heck yeah.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.000
You know I have a photo of him and my husband.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Yes, you have that up on your wall very proudly.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Yes.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Good times.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Loki?

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:43.000
So EA's come out making bold claims and I don't know.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
They keep coming out.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Listen, if you're a company that's kind of the number two company right now as far as

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.000
digital distribution goes, stop dogging on number one because, you know, going out there

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
and saying, hey, we're gonna be better than Steam.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
We're gonna do things Steam doesn't do.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Like, not put things on sale.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
How you like that shit?

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
I mean, it's come out sounding stupid.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.000
We're gonna take everything that makes Steam successful and not do it and we're gonna kick

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
their ass.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Fourth of July sale on Steam this week.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Just saying.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Let's pray.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Prayer circle.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Did it really start?

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
I know it hasn't started yet.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Let's form a prayer circle, everybody, for a kickass Steam sale.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Actually, maybe that shouldn't happen because I'll end up spending a hundred dollars on

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
a game.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
I thought the prayer circle was gonna be that they don't have a kickass sale so that

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
we don't waste all of our money on it.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
That's true.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
But anyways, so yeah.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
They've basically said they want to be the Facebook of digital distribution compared

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000
to Valve's MySpace.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
First off...

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Yeah, it is the stupidest thing ever.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
They're basically...

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
It's not gonna fucking happen, okay?

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:59.000
You're gonna talk all this shit but no one is gonna fucking go to Origin over Steam.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.000
I mean, granted, you're saying, oh, hey, look.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
You know, look at how well Origin's doing because all these people are signed up on

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
it.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
And all your fucking EA games require it.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Even the ones that aren't even on PC.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
You have to have a fucking Origin login.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:22.000
So, yeah, you have a lot more users or people that are signed up.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
It doesn't mean they're fucking buying things up.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Well, to be fair, Valve did the same shit and we all let it slip by.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Yes, but how many games does Valve release versus how many games EA releases?

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Valve games are like once in a decade.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I don't know.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
It's a fucking event.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Yes, exactly.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Yeah, because when Valve did it with Half-Life 2, no one knew what the fuck Steam was and

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
people were pissed about it.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:47.000
But we've all forgiven them because they're Valve.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:52.000
And Steam, of course, took a couple years to become fucking awesome, so Origin is still

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.000
a turd.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Yeah, but it's the turd that I'm hoping puts Mass Effect 3 on sale Tuesday.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Okay, so let me quote what they said here.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
EA is really in an interesting place.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:11.000
We have this bar that is set so high so that whether it is any of our games or services,

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000
we want to be 90 plus Metacritic at everything.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Origin is moving in that direction.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000
We are not there yet.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
We understand that, but we're going to get there soon.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Then fucking stop talking shit like your top dog and said, you know, eat your humble pie.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:32.000
And also, another thing, maybe you shouldn't start comparing yourself to Facebook because

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
people don't fucking like Facebook.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I mean, granted, people really don't like MySpace, but Facebook, it's not exactly favorable.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
So what are you going to do?

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:48.000
MySpace is getting into that I love the 90s type of thing, or better yet, I love the 70s

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000
or something where it's like, oh, remember when everybody had a pet rock?

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:56.000
I'm not exactly going to go out and buy a pet rock, but I look back on it with fond

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
memories.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Remember when people used to post blingies on your profile and they were funny?

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
That's MySpace.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
That was never attractive, Rob.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:05.000
That was never attractive.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.000
It was always hilarious.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:13.000
But seriously, what are they going to start doing on Origin?

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Are they going to start adding these at origin.com email addresses and stuff like that without

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:25.000
telling you and making those public so people can message you without you knowing them?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
Are they going to start throwing out your phone number to everybody?

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.000
I mean, Facebook's kind of being known lately with changing things when you don't want them,

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:42.000
or changing things that don't need to be changed, like not throwing sales, and also for leaking

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000
your personal information out there when you really don't want it.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:52.000
So, maybe you should consider not comparing yourself to that.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:57.000
And then also not comparing yourself to the top provider of anything until you become

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:00.000
the top provider of that.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Just saying.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Just saying.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000
I mean, obviously, yes, we aim to be better than our competition.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Cool.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.000
But don't talk so much shit until you have something to back it up with.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
All right.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Before we get into the listless results and the mailbag tonight, let's get into one more

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
story here about Blizzard, because they make some pretty popular PC games.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.000
I don't know if you've ever heard of Diablo, but that is kind of a big deal.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Or World of Warcraft.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:33.000
But anyhow, Blizzard has told us about what games will be coming to Gamescom 2012.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Mists of Pandaria will have its opening cinematic debuted, and there will be a hands-on demo

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
there.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Also, multiplayer for StarCraft II Heart of the Swarm.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Also, Diablo III will still be there in full display and all that, but they're not really

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:52.000
announcing anything with Diablo III.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.000
The other thing I want to say is that Gamescom 2012 is August 16th through 19th.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:04.000
A lot of people theorizing that Mists of Pandaria's release date clearly will not be before that,

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.000
but probably won't be long after that, because if they were debuting the cinematic, then,

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
well, shit, the game's not out, obviously, before that.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000
So a lot of people are theorizing at this point late September for the Mists of Pandaria

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
expansion.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.000
So it wasn't a full year of having to raid Dragon Soul, but pretty fucking close.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Just saying.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Anyhow, let's open the mailbag.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Every week, we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.000
And DarkSakura dives in the mailbag headfirst, pick a few of her favorite emails, and reads

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:40.000
them for you live on air.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Eh.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
Okay.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:47.000
First email.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Howdy.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000
First of all, a belated congratulations on your 10-year anniversary.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000
It's not a late congratulations.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
One year, I got a card for my birthday, which is in August, when I visited my grandparents

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:58.000
for Christmas.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
That is late.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000
Anyway, like many lemmings, I've been following the news of Microsoft Surface announcement.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:07.000
At first, I didn't think much of this announcement, then it dawned on me.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:12.000
If pulled off correctly, Microsoft Surface can do what tablets, netbooks, and the iPad

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:13.000
have been able to do.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Bring PC titles to the portable market.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.000
Now, I'm not talking about the latest and greatest titles, but games from several years

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
ago that people can still appreciate.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Hell, if they could get a good version of The Sims or while working on the thing, Microsoft

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Surface can take off.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Stay black, Retertainment, Garris.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Sent from my iPad.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.000
So clearly, he's interested in the Surface if he sent it from his iPad.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Unless that was a joke, I don't know.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:42.000
The Surface, the press conference was a little bit of a letdown.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I think we were expecting something bigger.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000
For me, I have one of the new iPads now, so I'm not really interested in the tablet for

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.000
another three years at least.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000
They do some interesting things with it, that's for sure.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:57.000
And I mean, if I was going to buy a tablet, I would probably get one of those.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000
But at the same time, I think they're going to be pretty expensive since they haven't

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
announced price or dates yet.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Although, that new Google tablet does look pretty nice.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Yeah, I was hearing about that too.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
But I'm tableted out.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Well, we actually were looking at the Nexus because Dan got the phone and he loves it.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
So we're sort of thinking about that tablet.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:25.000
But anyway, so the next email comes from RDGSinge.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
So small news for those into Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000
A recent fan-made patch was released that removes a set of in-game rules called laws

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
allowing the player to play in more inventive ways.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:40.000
And you can find an article on that on romhacking.net.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Okay, cool.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Next email.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Hey, OLR, this is Blade3 AKA The Honey Badger.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
What, because you don't give a fuck?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.000
I just wanted to say congratulations on your 10th anniversary and so sorry I cannot participate live.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Also, I was chatting through Steam with Nick Crafter from Video Game Show, another show

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
syndicated by All Games.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
I told him about VoG and how I wanted him to get in contact with you guys because

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.000
VGS is a great show and I told him it would be cool to see another great show featured on VoG.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:12.000
So I told him I would contact you guys to help expedite the process.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I hope you would consider their show for your network and if so, thanks very much.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:23.000
You guys show kicks ass along with the entire VoG network.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Although we appreciate the referrals and so forth and we do think if you know of a great show

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:32.000
that ought to be on the VoG network, you should let us know.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Do remember that, and I'm putting this out there as a generality for everything,

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.000
not specifically this email, but this email triggered a little thing in my head like,

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
oh, I need to say that on the show at some point.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.000
Do remember the only people authorized to speak on behalf of the VoG network

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:53.000
are the hosts of this show, Bobby Black Wolf Show, and sometimes hosts of other shows

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:56.000
depending on the network already, depending on what the topic is.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:01.000
But if you really want to talk to somebody in charge, you need to talk to one of us or Bobby.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000
So just putting that out there because I don't ever, ever, ever want somebody to promise something

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:10.000
on behalf of VoG we can't deliver on.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
I just want to make that very clear.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I'm not saying no in this case, but I can say we are looking for more stuff than just video games.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Although I am familiar with this show and it's a pretty kick ass show and I'd be happy to work with them in some capacity.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:35.000
But we'd definitely like more shows on like, you know, comic books, movies, other nerd culture things,

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:41.000
especially like particular series and things like that, other parts of fandom would be great

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.000
because we are really trying to expand the geek network.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Okay. PS, I have been listening since 2004 when I got my first iPod, the iPod mini.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:56.000
I have grown up on your show as I was only 10 years old when I began listening and I am now 18.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Thanks for everything. I cannot tell you what it would be like without your show.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Aww.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Aww, that's very sweet.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I feel kind of old, kind of.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Okay, last email.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Hello, OLR Crew. Some random questions and topics of interest for you.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Number one, a few weeks back Dark Sakura brought up Hatsune Miku Project Diva for Vita,

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
making an appearance at this year's E3 convention.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Few websites had mentioned a Sega rep state of the game could be localized if there was an interest.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.000
I tried to contact Sega's community folks but got no response.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:35.000
What do you think could be done to get Sega's attention on bringing Project Diva over here?

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Hit them on Twitter, hit them on Facebook, hit them through the forums, get other people to do it too,

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:47.000
and why not make a stupid online petition? I don't know.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:55.000
But I mean, get enough people to say something to them. Start a Facebook community.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Get out there and pick it with signs.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Yeah.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Facebook is a pretty decent way to be visible in this day and age, and that's not a bad idea.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Because that also gives them numbers, which they can then take back to management and say,

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:19.000
look, 15,000 people want this game, and that'll help. Anyhow.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Next email?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Next email is from, no, not next email, there's more to this email.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.000
There were more questions, Rob, jumping to conclusions.

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
For shame, for shame.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:37.000
What is everyone's thoughts on Microsoft Surface? I have no thoughts on this.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Oh, didn't we just talk about that a little bit?

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
We did, so we can move on.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Defer to the prior conversation.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Okay, Sky.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Uh-oh.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Since you express interest in first-party shooters, do give Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 a try on PC.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Age of Team Fortress 2's nine classes have play styles that don't always rely on having pinpoint accuracy.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.000
On the other hand, Left 4 Dead 2 should help you improve your aim a bit.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
I have played a little bit of Left 4 Dead 1, and it was fun.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Alan and I played that a little bit, right Alan? And we had some good times with that. Left 4 Dead.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I was really, really bad at it. It was kind of fun.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Have a good evening and may a visit to Pinkberry be in your futures, and that comes from the Nasty Canasta.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.000
P.S., Garris, and Tali, too.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.000
And there are no more emails.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us another email for a future week.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Alright, let's do a few more stories. Oh, no, the FUs of the week.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
We gotta get our angst out.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
It's time to get ranty.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Why? Because we can.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Music

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:06.000
FU'd a gluten for making me freaking sick all day yesterday, to where I couldn't even leave the house.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I bet the pizza was so good.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Alan.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:19.000
So once my new job starts and I'm fully trained and I'm actually allowed to do it by myself, it's like super late night shift depending on how shitty things are.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:27.000
So won't be able to leave work until possibly 11 or midnight, which means I'm going to have to get a car at some point.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Someone's not going to pick my ass up all the time that late when they have a morning job.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:37.000
So I guess FU'd a the reality that I might have to have a car and a license by the end of the year.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
You should get a Vespa.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:43.000
And yes, I know that I'm nearly 34 with no license in a car and there's a very long history behind it.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Like my family never had a car growing up and I just thought that it's expensive and scary and shitty.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Now I finally have to do it.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Well, like I told you before, my mom had a lot of the same thoughts you did.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
And she didn't end up getting a license until she was 37 and pretty much had to.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
But she takes back roads everywhere. She doesn't have to touch the freeway.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Growing up in the East Bay and on the peninsula of San Francisco, the transit is a joke compared to New York.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:14.000
But it was good enough that I made it work. Up here in Sacramento, transit sucks.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Alright, Loki.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Fuck you to the sudden bursting water pipe that we had at our house.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Thankfully we caught it right when it happened, so there wasn't any damage.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:37.000
But still, the whole process is fucking annoying. We had a giant dehumidifier, which is the size of a small fridge.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.000
And it sounds like a loud can opener.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I was reading about that on Nellie's Facebook and yours. Sorry that happened to you guys.

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000
No, at least we were home because she was about to leave.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:53.000
And I had talked to some people that they were not home when that happened and that was not fun.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:01.000
Alright, let's see. My FU of the Week goes to the fact, this is easy, the fact that I was sick on my birthday.

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:06.000
That's right. I don't know how, but I caught some type of sinus-y infection thingy.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:10.000
You might hear it in my voice still, actually. I sound a little different tonight.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
I've been trying to kick this for about a week, which included on my birthday.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.000
So thank you, Mother Nature, for that little present. Really appreciate it.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Speaking of presents, just to let you know, I've got presents coming for both of you.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000
I have to finish making them.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Very cool.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.000
But there are presents coming and they are for you both.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Aww, yay.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:31.000
The next O.L.R. is going to be on my birthday.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Oh my god. Oh shit, that means I can't do it, huh?

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000
No, we don't have to do anything out for my birthday.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
We'll figure something out. We'll do it before or after.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
But I'll have to bring it then.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:44.000
You'll probably have to work anyway. Oh wait, no, maybe not on the 8th.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Yeah.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Oh well, we'll figure something out. We'll throw a party on air just for you.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Maybe you'll have to come right back next week.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Wicked says F you to being bad at cataheroics.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been so mercenary in saying how could anyone die on Benedictus.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Because I have been in a failed party that died on Benedictus.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Not through anything I did, through everybody else sucking.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Only the well players know what I'm talking about.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Just make sure you don't stand in stuff and dodge the waves. Be aware.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I have an F you to add.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:20.000
What?

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.000
To the um, to the add on GTFO for being annoying.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Me! You're standing as shit. Me!

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
You need to tell it to GTFO.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:32.000
I thought it would help and it just was annoying.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Alright, let's get to the listless results.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.000
You've all been dying to hear it. What is the definitive answer, kids, to the list?

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Thing that Atari 2600, or excuse me, Atari in general, could do to be relevant like they were in the 2600 days.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.000
How could a 40 year old company be as relevant as they were in 1982?

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Here it is, the top three answers.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:58.000
As mentioned, nominated by the host and voted on by chat.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Number three.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Number three answer is.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Yay!

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Y'all are pervs.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Number three answer.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
The number two answer tonight.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Marble Madness 2.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
That's the game people want.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
That's definitely a game people want.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
And the number one answer.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
What do you most want?

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:28.000
A sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:32.000
That is what will save Atari's ass.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And I still say it could be a launch title for the Atari 1090.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I do.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:37.000
So there it is.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Your top three answers.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Thanks for playing.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Here's a lifetime supply of turtle wax.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:48.000
And Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco Treat.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
The other thing they could do that would be kind of funny is like an arcade game that's basically an Atari 2600.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.000
But you know how they have that giant Tetris machine with the controller that's really huge?

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
You do one even better.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:02.000
My god, I played that at Golf Land like a week or two ago.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I think it was scary.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:09.000
The Atari 2600 controller is really simple. It's just a giant button and basically a giant joystick.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:15.000
So you have this giant foam joystick that you can kind of swing on or whatever in a giant button.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.000
So you play 2600 games on a giant screen with the giant controller.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
It would be funny.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000
A giant 2600. That would be great, actually.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Hilarious.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Alright, so we talked a little bit about the Wii U and of course there's all different companies promising to bring various games to the platform.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:44.000
One of which is actually, well, they do have a game coming to the Wii U at launch.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Their Ninja Gaiden 3 is getting a port, but Team Ninja is also thinking about Dead or Alive 5 for the Wii U.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000
And that makes sense because if you think about it, you know, they're doing Ninja Gaiden 3.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:05.000
There's already Tekken Tag Tournament 2, so it wouldn't be that difficult to port a game over, I think, from the PlayStation 3 or 360 to the Wii U.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:12.000
And they're saying right now we're doing our best to get ready for PlayStation 3 and 360 for the version of Dead or Alive 5.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:21.000
But we want to hear what players think about the Wii U version or if they'd be interested in it.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:31.000
So, I could see that happening, especially with a Game of the Year edition or something like that. They could do it.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:36.000
That could be pretty awesome, actually. You know, because it's a fun series.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000
It's always hilarious in this day and age to see very adult games on a Nintendo platform.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I'd be curious what the tablet would be for. How about Boob Cam?

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Well, they do have photo mode.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Do they?

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Yes, they do.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Nice.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:58.000
And remember, not only do they have photo mode, but I believe this game had transparent clothing.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Like, you could actually get, like, water or something like that on different parts of the clothing and it would be, you know, the correct transparency and stuff like that.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Or, um, maybe it was ripping clothing. Something to the effect of you see more boobies.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Do you think Team Ninja would feel burned at all over the reception over Metroid Other M or do you think it's kind of like, eh, you know?

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:29.000
I think if anything, they're going to be more burned at the fact that Ninja Gaiden 3 sucks and that, you know, it's going to be launched out for the Wii U and people won't give a shit.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Aw.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Sorry. Unless they go back and fix the game, I don't think people are going to give a shit.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Alright. One more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to add us on Skype.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Do remember, we appreciate if you check Echo 1-2-3 first before using Skype.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:40:02.000
But you can also, and, you know, think outside the box, you can also use Skype on a Vita, you can use Skype on an iOS device or I'm pretty sure Android has it too.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Many ways you can install Skype and call the show or you can just pick up a damn telephone.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:10.000
If you still have one of those telephones on your wall with a rotary dial, it will work.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:15.000
1-877-GAME-OLR. You just will probably have to dial a lot.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
So get your finger ready.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:21.000
But first, one more story and this has to do with Retro City Rampage.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Some folks looking forward to this game because it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.000
God, when the hell is that coming out?

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
If it was on the NES.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:34.000
No answer, but what I can tell you, it's going to support cross-play on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:41.000
So, meaning if you buy it on one platform, you get it on the other and you can play across the two.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Well, do you get it on the other or do you have to buy both and then you can play?

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Nope, you get one and you unlock the other.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Sweet!

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:51.000
That's awesome.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:52.000
One payment, both versions.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Hooray!

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000
I know, I will be getting it for the Vita.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.000
As reported by IndieGames.com, it's the pay once, cross-play deal.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Said by, who is this guy?

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Martin Turton, who's with Clever Beans, putting this game out.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:12.000
Quote, we think that the appeal of the buy once deal, which should hopefully attract more people to buy the game,

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:17.000
far outweighs any extra sales we might get from people who are prepared to buy the game twice.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Especially considering that require two separate purchases would be likely to cause a fair backlash.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Basically, we want to price the game in a way that would attract us to buy it ourselves.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Very interesting tactic.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:32.000
They're basically saying, you know what, yeah, we could double dip people.

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:38.000
But if we don't and we make it free, it's going to attract more people to the game because it's like, hey, free game.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Well, I was originally going to get it on 360, although I might still buy it on PlayStation Network and 360 because it could be fun.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I don't know, we'll see.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Start with the Vita.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:54.000
So good job on you, Retro City Rampage.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Some good news to end with tonight.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
We're going to open up Skype line.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000
It's open.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000
If you want to call, do it now.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:10.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
I'm logging into Twitter right now.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.000
I was on the wrong Twitter.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
I was on my personal Twitter.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And I saw a message that caught my eye that I'm just going to have to read it later because I'm trying to do a show.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Yeah, Rob, on your Twitter as I check my Facebook.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Let's go to some tweets while we wait for calls.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Again, Skype line is open.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:37.000
YYR says, ask Dark Tetsuya.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
That's the person right below.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:40.000
That's not me.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Ask Dark Sakura to give Fernando, the main character in Bungee Ferret Tossing or BFD, a last name.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
He's French Canadian.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
And then get back to me.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Well, shit, this could have been the list list tonight, but oops.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Fernando needs a last name.

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:01.000
He is French Canadian.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Cocteau.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:07.000
I was going to say an amalgamation of Celine Dion.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
She's French Canadian.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Fernando Celine Dion?

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Fernando C. Dion.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Alright, never mind.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:17.000
That's stupid.

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Yeah, that is.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000
I was trying to think of a way to make it work like Cécile Dion.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
You think about that Dark Sakura while I take this call.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Poisson.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:30.000
No, I thought of it. Poisson.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I'm taking a call.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
Who's this?

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Hey, what's up?

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
This is John, aka Wicked, from the Nerdgasm Network.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.000
What is up, John, aka Wicked, from the Nerdgasm Network?

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Indie podcast, holla.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
What's up, Robert?

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
What's up?

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:56.000
This is the first time I've actually been on the live stream, in the chat, listening to the show live, but I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Awesome. Well, thank you for joining us live, and I'm happy we could pop your Skype cherry tonight.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Definitely. I meant to come in last week, but, you know, wow, don't you say anything.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:13.000
It was kind of a pain in the ass to get through last week, so it's a lot clearer tonight.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Definitely. I just wanted to say hi to everybody there, and just kind of slightly promote Nerdgasm Network a little bit, but I do have a little bit of discussion. It's not shameless self-promotion completely.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:31.000
All right. Okay, first discussion, then shameless self-promotion.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Gotcha. There were some talks with the Wii U earlier, and I mentioned this inside the chat, and I kind of want to get your guys' opinion on this.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Yeah.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:58.000
But it seems like Nintendo's not really kind of learning from their old mistakes, because the Wii kind of came out before the 360 and the PS3, I believe, and you can obviously tell by comparison that the Wii is not the strongest graphically of the three systems.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:14.000
And sadly, it seems like the Wii U is going to come out again, and while it's going to be superior to the 360 and the PS3 as far as graphics and check and everything, it's still going to vastly be inferior to, you know, whatever the Microsoft Sony platform is going to be.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I'm just wondering, do you think Nintendo should have even, like, brought this out now, or do you think they probably should have waited a year and tried to equalize it? I mean, do they understand that they're going to, you know, that they're essentially going to repeat the path?

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:39.000
Here's the thing, and, you know, in theory, what you're saying, it sounds good, and to me, as somebody who's been gaming for many, many years, it makes a lot of sense, and I always want the best technology and all that.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:53.000
However, there's one big flaw, and that is the Wii sold fuck tons. Far after the 360 and the PS3 came out, the Wii was still selling fuck tons, even though it wasn't the most powerful system.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:46:15.000
And so I think Nintendo would be happy as shit to sell even three quarters of the amount of Wii U as they sold the Wii. However, I will say this, one thing, if they don't prepare well enough for the future, the theory that you do have here is right, in that the technology will lose steam and it will lose steam fast.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:27.000
That's the problem, is that the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, they're continuing to sell in some ways Sony better than ever, but Nintendo, they fell down the shitter in the past year.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:36.000
But the only problem is that this new generation of systems, or at least this new Nintendo system, isn't that, it's not very different from the Wii.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:44.000
See, before, with the Wii, there wasn't a system out like that. It was completely new. These motion controls were completely unique to it, and it was a unique experience.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:54.000
The Wii U with an extra tablet controller, people are familiar with tablets. I don't think they're going to give a shit that it's slightly better graphics and it has a tablet controller on it.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:10.000
They're going to be like, why do I need this? I can buy a Wii. And honestly, they can. They can buy a Wii and New Super Mario Brothers and they have pretty much the same offering as New Super Mario Brothers U and a Wii U, except they don't have the extra tablet controller and the graphics aren't slightly prettier, I guess.

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:22.000
I guess at the end of the day, it also comes down to how badly do soccer moms across America want a sequel to New Super Mario Brothers Wii, because it's about the most exciting original IP that Nintendo unveiled for that thing.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:30.000
And it's not even that original, but it's a successful formula. That's what this is all about.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:43.000
And sadly, I think software might end up playing a big issue, especially, I mean, it's Nintendo, so obviously third-party software is going to be a big issue, especially because when they first originally announced the Wii U, one of the big titles they were toting was Batman Arkham City.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:48.000
And the thing is, that's already been out for about a year, and the Wii U still isn't even out yet.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:56.000
So are they still really going to be toting a two-year-old, essentially, when the release is probably a two-year-old game, as like a flagship bearer?

02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Sadly, if E3 is any indication, yes. But it's got a cool new mechanism.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:12.000
But I don't think that's necessarily a big game for them, because, I mean, yeah, it's cool that they have Batman Arkham City, but there's plenty of other games that are coming out around the same time, like Assassin's Creed 3, which will be pretty big.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:22.000
And then they've got a lot of exclusives for the system as well. But yeah, it's kind of stupid that they're going to have all these games that have been out for months or years before it comes out, like Ninja Gaiden 3.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:31.000
Darksiders 2, to a lesser extent, because that's only coming out a few months before, but it's still something that's going to have been out for a while.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Not even Mass Effect is getting me that excited.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:40.000
Yes, Mass Effect 3 is like, seriously, I mean, that's just, it seems like easy money.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Unless I can finally romance some of the characters I've been wanting to romance, like that.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Me too.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.000
That's just, it's my secret.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:49.000
Mm-hmm!

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:50.000
I can see him doing good.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:54.000
I can see him doing like a Game of the Year edition with Mass Effect, although that would be pretty quick.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
She is a bit of a cougar, isn't she?

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Exactly. Alright, self-promotion time, so we can wrap up and get more calls, but self-promotion. We like to support indie podcasts, so please, plug away.

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Alright, I've got three podcasts I want to plug. Obviously, my home at NergasmNetwork.com. We've got great discussions going on, we've got a video game podcast that I co-host with Ryan, Josh, Patrick, a few other people.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:36.000
They also have a new movie podcast, where it's kind of like a riff-track, where they watch a movie and they kind of discuss, like, they kind of poke fun at it, but they also kind of discuss, you know, the cinematography and all the other stuff.

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
That's a great idea.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:48.000
That's a great, you know, and I've heard other people kind of talking about that sort of thing, like a, I don't want to call it a riff-tracks podcast, but that's kind of what heavily inspires it sort of thing, to play along with the movie.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:54.000
I'm glad somebody is doing it, and not just talking about it. It's great.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Yeah, we're just having issues with the YouTube channel, because that's where we're uploading the films plus the commentary, and we're getting some issues with that.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
But we're working on it.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:20.000
But, you know, there's nothing wrong with putting just the commentary out there and say, okay, press play in three, two, one, go, you know, and you can watch the movie along, especially if its title is available on Netflix. Tons of people have Netflix. It'd be super easy.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Yeah, I'd be fun to work on it.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Also, Nergasm Network is home to the bi-weekly beer chasm, where Ryan and some more select groups review beer.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Well, my gosh, you don't just have a podcast, you have a whole freaking network over there, but that sounds, that's awesome.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Yeah, there's also a couple other shows coming down the pipeline. We've got a music podcast, there's going to be a tech, kind of an overall tech podcast coming up as well.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:52.000
But yeah, nerdgasmnetwork.com, that's, like you said, indie podcast going away.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
That's right.

02:50:54.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Yeah, and I've got one more site I kind of want to pimp out. I'm sure you know these guys. Slykick and Spike, the hosts of GameBooey.org.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:07.000
That's right. It's a newer show, but it's a lot of fun.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Yeah, I used to go to high school with Spike, so I'm really good friends with him. Slykick used to be a guest on my old podcast, Geeks or Fans, but that kind of closed up earlier this year.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Don't. But yeah, no, Spike and Slykick are two very, very good friends of mine, and I've been begging them to come up and be on OLR forever, so open invite, guys.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:38.000
You want to come pimp your show, get your butt up here to Sacramento. It's not China, it's not that far of a foreign land.

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Yeah, we'll try getting them to even get to Stockton and try to get them to come out here for like 12 years now.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:48.000
All right, we'll both keep pestering them, and one of us will win eventually.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:57.000
Definitely. In fact, I actually started listening to Orange Laundrio because of Hoard House because Slykick actually promoted a couple episodes he was on on Hoard House.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Indie podcast promotion, it works. It works.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Yeah, definitely. So, you know, there's two podcast sites that you guys should check out, GameBooey.org and, of course, NergasmNetwork.com.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:15.000
All right, if I let you plug anymore, I'm going to have to make you pay for it. All right, have a good one, buddy. I've got to take more calls. Thank you for your call.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:18.000
All right. No problem. And keep listening to OLR.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.000
All right, will do.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.000
By the way, I have decided on a last name thanks to Alan.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Oh, okay. Bye, take care.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Yes, you have a last name thanks to Alan.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Poutine.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Poutine. So the name will be Fernando Poutine.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Fernando Poutine.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
All right, there it is. That's the name. Fernando Poutine.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundrio. Who's this?

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:36.000
It's Shane.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Hey, Shane, what's up?

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.000
It's me. I'm awake.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Is there anything you wanted to call to share with us tonight?

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Yes.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Garris.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:50.000
I want to talk about Mass Effect.

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Yay, my favorite topic.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:56.000
It's mine too. What a coincidence.

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Yeah, that's weird.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:10.000
So I'll get it out of the way. First of all, I do like the extended cut stuff, despite a lot of people hating it. And I understand their complaints, but I like all the happy and sad parts of it. So it's cool.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:30.000
But I think either BioWare is really stupid and the fans are brilliant or BioWare is an evil genius because I'm finding even more people starting to subscribe to the indoctrination theory after the extended cut now.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:45.000
And there's all these new things that they put in the extended cut that point to it. And it's getting ridiculous. And I'm torn because I used to believe in it. I still kind of do. But at the same time, I don't want to keep going with it.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:52.000
If you want something to be true bad enough, you'll find a way to make it true in your mind. You know?

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Yes, but there's videos and sound files.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Again, that's all part of they're just wishing really hard, wishing I want it to be true. Click my heels three times. There's no place like indoctrination theory. There's no place like something like that.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.000
I don't think they would ever really say that.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I did. Okay, well, so it hasn't just been about Mass Effect this week, though, but you also have been playing Final Fantasy 11 with me. And for a change, I started playing the game first and peer pressured you into buying it.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.000
So what did you think about the return to Final Fantasy 11?

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:35.000
It was a nice like homecoming sort of feeling. And I like that everything's familiar, but at the same time, they've changed it enough that it's still interesting.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:45.000
So it's not just the same. Let's go to the dunes and level for four hours, but only get, you know, 50% of the way through a level because we died seven times.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Right.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:57.000
That's fantastic. Like, I want to keep playing it, but then there's Mass Effect multiplayer I have to play. And that's really the only two games I'm jumping between. Wow. I don't even turn that on for the most part now.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:07.000
Well, the good news is there's not a lot of other games coming out. So now's a good chance to kind of catch up on stuff like I, I still really need to play Skyrim, even though I've been hearing kind of tepid reception of the DLC.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.000
I never did beat the frickin campaign mode in the first game. I need to go back and do that.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:24.000
That's right. I started replaying that last night cause I got really bored and it was still okay, but I'm not going to download any DLC cause it's an Elder Scrolls game and they're generally awful. So I don't care.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:28.000
It's hit and miss. It's hit and miss. All right. Well, anything else you want to share with us tonight, Shane?

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:32.000
No, cause I'm sure I'll just talk more about Mass Effect on the courthouse.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Well, like I was bugging you last night, just put the pen to paper and write out something to post on vognetwork.com.

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Actually, Shane, I have to ask you a question.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I have an answer. What's up?

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:46.000
What do you think of my idea for an MMO for Mass Effect?

02:55:46.000 --> 02:56:04.000
I would drop all my games to play it, but I also don't know how it would work. Like, especially with the current universe the way it is. I don't know what we would really base the MMO off of.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.000
I see. I have to finish the third one before I can decide, but I'm sort of thinking, you know, post end game.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.000
And then you have to figure out which endings can end then.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Prequel, prequel, prequel, prequel. You just don't know it in the same storyline.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Nobody wants a prequel because then if you do a prequel and if you set it too far back, then you'd be stuck on like earth, which would be boring.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:36.000
Easy ass prequel because with the whole like Horde Alliance, you know, two faction type of thing, Turian War. You set the MMO during the Turian War.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
No, that's terrible.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I disagree.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:42.000
Only because you wouldn't be able to romance a Turian.

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Shut up.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Unless you were a Turian.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Because it's true.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:52.000
But it might be the first time we see female Turians, so that might make it worth it alone.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:57.000
They were apparently in the comic and they don't, they look like horrible, so no.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
That's not what female Turians look like in my head.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:03.000
All right. Before this turns into the Mass Effect show, I gotta let you go, Shane.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Shane, we should do that. A Mass Effect show.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Oh, he's already pitched one to me.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
Yeah, I already have.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
And I say produce a pilot.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.000
All right. All right, take care.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Bye bye.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:16.000
Bye.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:21.000
1877 game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.000
I did tweet YYR back. Hopefully he got it.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Because you're confusing the poor guy, because you sent him something else first, I think.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:29.000
Poutine. Poutine.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.000
It is poutine.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000
I stick with poutine.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
All right, the final answer.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Because that's a good idea, because it's kind of disgusting looking, but delicious.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Like a ferret?

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Ferrets aren't delicious.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
I've never had ferret.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.000
All right, we have another call coming in. Let's take it.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
You're confused.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Sorry, this is Techie Q.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Say that again?

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Sorry, this is Techie Q.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Techie Q?

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Techie Q, sorry.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Techie Q, I got you. Techie Q, what's on your mind, buddy? Hi, welcome to the show.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Two things. One, congratulations on your 10 year since I didn't get to call in last week.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:14.000
The phone lines were absolutely bonkers last week, but we appreciate it.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:17.000
We like the fact that our birthday can last across multiple weeks.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.000
And also, I want to gloat on the classic game of the week.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:26.000
I'm one of the few people that beat Ninja Gaiden without cheating.

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Well, look at you.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Hey, I know. Mad props, seriously.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:35.000
I do want to shake your hand. I'm giving you a virtual handshake right now.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
He really did. He held his hand up in front of the monitor.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:44.000
I did. I was looking for an emote icon that I could possibly send over, but that'll have to do.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:48.000
There he is. A thumbs up. I just sent him.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:52.000
But, I mean, seriously, it's really damn difficult to beat that game.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:53.000
It is. It is.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
So anyone who has, hey, you can do this for me.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:59.000
I mean, it's special like the last level. It's like an endurance run.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:03.000
And isn't it just the biggest exercise in frustration?

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Uh, for the first hour it is.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:09.000
To get back to the three bosses you have to beat three times.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:16.000
I'll put it this way. Even beating Ghosts N' Goblins isn't nearly as frustrating as Ninja Gaiden.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Let me ask you this question, TechieQ.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:22.000
Do you like the new Ninja Gaiden games? Because clearly you're a fan of the old ones.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:25.000
But do you think they got it right with the newer ones?

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:28.000
I don't like the third one. I really dumbed it down.

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Nobody does. Let's be real.

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Like the last Ninja Gaiden, the newer one I played was the second one.

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:40.000
And that one red-ringed my 360. So I'm scared to play it.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:44.000
Oh my gosh. You know what red-ringed my 360?

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.000
What's that?

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Joust.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Oh, wow.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:48.000
Right?

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.000
Yeah, that's crazy.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:50.000
That's sad.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Alright.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
Well, TechieQ, congratulations.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Did you beat the classic 8-bit sequels?

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
What was it, the two ships and the other one?

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Two, I didn't beat three. I just didn't even care anymore because it's so hard.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:09.000
That one actually had lives and continues to mess with.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:12.000
If you have a working Super Nintendo somewhere, you should look for that compilation.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:15.000
It was really good. It had all three games on it.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:16.000
Right.

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:21.000
Alright, well, TechieQ, anything else you want to share with the listeners and such tonight?

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Chainsaw light pop is awesome.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Chainsaw light pop. I've been hearing some mixed things on it.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
But what makes it awesome? Why do you like it?

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:36.000
I think it's the humor and the 80s satire that people miss out if you don't play enough of the game.

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:40.000
You know, that's true. Humor can go a long way because I seriously loved Saints Row the Third.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:46.000
And let's be real, it's not that great of a game and it's nothing you haven't seen in stuff like Grand Theft Auto.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:49.000
But the humor is what makes it a lot of fun.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Yeah.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
That and the sing-along for what I've got.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I think you'd like it too, because it's got a lot of 80s satire and they did a Commodore 64 segment.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:06.000
I'm going to have to check that out. And boobies, right? Is there lots of boobies?

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:09.000
You've got the right costume. You've got a grand fort.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
There you go. Alright.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:15.000
Well, TechieQ, I've got to let you go, but Lollipop Chainsaw, I'll check it out and let you know what I think in a future week.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Okay, take care.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:17.000
Take care.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Alright, bye.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Alright, I'm going to have to close up the Skype line just because we're running a little long and I still got to get last minute stories and tweets.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
You know what I want?

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.000
What?

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:27.000
Poutine.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
I've had it before. It's really good.

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:39.000
It is really good. It is really good. If you ask really, really nicely, maybe Allen will get you a little spoon and there's some strawberry pinkberry in the freezer.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Alright, don't give her too much because I want some later.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
One spoonful. No, I'm kidding.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.000
Alright, more tweets.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:55.000
Ziba tweets us saying, have you guys seen Tron Uprising, the animated series yet?

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:58.000
I have seen the first episode so far and it was really good.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.000
You and I have seen the same amount of Tron Uprising.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:10.000
I was going to write a further review for VOG, but then I realized that because the guy in the truck was a liar, I was behind in the episodes and I never got a chance to catch up.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
So I'm going to defer that review to later.

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:18.000
But based on the first episode of Tron Uprising that I saw, yeah, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
I was going to give it a positive review.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:27.000
It wasn't perfect. I felt the storyline was a little bit cliche and predictable, but it is a cartoon. Let's not be too harsh on it.

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:31.000
And I liked the whole dark style of it.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:38.000
It was a very Batman animated series look because Batman was always a black canvas as opposed to a white canvas.

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:41.000
And I'm pretty sure Tron has done very similarly.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:42.000
You really liked it too, right?

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:45.000
Yeah, I watched the first three episodes.

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:51.000
It was good. I've liked it so far. I still need to catch up on some of them that I missed.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Alright.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:57.000
Dark Tetsuya says he's going to make good on President Kat Pong, so stay tuned.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.000
I don't know how he's doing it, but maybe there's like a Pong maker? I don't know. We'll see.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:11.000
Alright, moving on. Tigerclaw sharing a couple news tweets with us. The Google Nexus 7 is going to be available at GameStop.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
That story's been making the rounds this week.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:19.000
It actually doesn't surprise me too much because GameStop has been openly like, trade us your iPhone, trade us your iPad.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:27.000
They want to get into that market and I think it's because they're trying, you know, as much as I am personally not a fan of GameStop,

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:36.000
I can appreciate that they're trying to stay a step ahead and like, oh shit, if everything goes digital distribution, our market's going to be hardware.

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:43.000
You know, we're going to be fucked soon. So they're trying to get their fingers in other pies so that they don't go completely out of business.

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
So you know what? It makes sense.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Honestly, I think it's because they're trying to get more reasons for people to trade in their stuff and some people want to trade in games to buy tablets and stuff.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:55.000
And so that way they can sell more used games.

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:56.000
Interesting.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Because there's no markup in hardware. So, I mean, I'm not sure about consumer electronics, but I know for game hardware there's no markup.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:08.000
But what I said has to be some of it, right? I mean, that they're trying to get into other stuff than just games.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:12.000
They're not worried about it because of, you know, who they are.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Alright, one other tweet from Tigerclaw. This will be the last tweet and then we can go to last minute stories. I don't know even if you have any.

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:24.000
But the shutdown law in South Korea. We reported on this either last week or the week before.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:33.000
Some folks are challenging it. NCSoft being one of them, according to this news story from gamesindustry.biz that Tigerclaw sent me on Twitter.

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:39.000
South Korea shutdown law has been called into question by citizens and game companies.

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
Two lawsuits have been filed against the law.

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:49.000
One is a Korean organization representing parents and children who says the law undermines parental rights to educate their children.

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:57.000
We need that organization here.

03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:05.000
The second lawsuit was filed by game publishers NCSoft, Neowiz, and Nexon.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:08.000
And they just argue the law itself is illegal.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:15.000
The lawsuits were filed last fall and the arguments are currently being heard, etc.

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:18.000
So we'll get more news on that in the coming weeks.

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:21.000
There you go. That's it for tweets. How about last minute stories tonight, Loki?

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:30.000
The voice actor for Duke Nukem is bitching that some of the voice acting work in video games goes over to film actors.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:36.000
And he says film actors do not need voice acting roles in video games or commercial projects.

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:40.000
These roles are for voice actors, not Hollywood celebrities.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:43.000
And when you consider the amount of money they make for each and every film project,

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:49.000
it's unfair for those of us who have struggled to make ends meet in our chosen profession.

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:52.000
I have trained and worked hard for nearly 30 years as a voice actor.

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:58.000
And when film stars land a role in either game or commercial project, they earn far more than I do,

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:04.000
even though I am a SAG-AFTRA union member.

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:08.000
How is that fair? I don't appreciate them taking work from me and my fellow VAs.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:12.000
Well, you know what? People aren't being drawn to games because your name's on it.

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:15.000
And maybe they just audition better than you do.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:24.000
I really hate to say it, but I think this guy is just, I mean, the reality is, he needs to ask the question,

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:29.000
well, why do celebrities get in Shrek? And why are they in the Disney movies?

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:35.000
And why are they, you know, because unfortunately star power and the names behind it mean a lot.

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:42.000
And as much, it sucks because this guy does have an iconic voice in many ways.

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:46.000
The voice of Duke Nukem, right? Hail to the king, baby. And all that stuff, right?

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:51.000
Nobody knows his name. Maybe that's what needs to change.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Maybe there needs to be more recognition about who you are and then you build that star power.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
I think that's the problem.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:08.000
It just made me think about something, though, back to Mass Effect, how you've got Martin Sheen as the elusive man.

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:13.000
And modeled on him and everything, you've got all of these actors, you know, Seth Green in it.

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:21.000
But the main characters, well, you have main characters there, but the main character is a well-noted voice actor.

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:27.000
Well, I'm actually thinking of the female Shepard, who's done like fantastic roles,

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:31.000
and the Avengers cartoon was in X-Men and all kinds of stuff.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:37.000
And you've got the talents going, and that's where they're best directed.

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:42.000
And I think that that's really the approach that should be taken, that everyone should be done by their merits.

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:46.000
What are their skills as a voice actor? Martin Sheen sounds like Martin Sheen.

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:49.000
He's not hiding that this is Martin Sheen playing a role.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:56.000
But I doubt he'd be able to go in and be a different voice than Martin Sheen, you know what I mean?

03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:02.000
That's my point. So I kind of agree and kind of don't.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:06.000
Just saying, just saying.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:11.000
All right. Well, any other last-minute stories to share tonight?

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:22.000
There's a new Kickstarter for a game that's, I guess, being built on the Rage Engine, and it's called Ravaged.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:26.000
I guess it's supposed to be like a multiplayer-type game.

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:32.000
I guess Rage, you know, they were kind of promising this big multiplayer thing, and it never really happened.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:39.000
So now it's this, oh, it's being based on Unreal 3, and it's going to look like Rage, though.

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:43.000
So Ravaged, multiplayer kind of Rage-type game.

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:50.000
Post-apocalyptic, car racing, gun fighting. Looks neat.

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:56.000
Oh, and speaking of Kickstarter, that retro, was it the retro game 101?

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
Yeah, you mentioned that last week. Already hit it, right?

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:01.000
Yeah, they already hit it. I was surprised.

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:04.000
Well, so Kickstarter is still working for some folks.

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:05.000
Yeah.

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:09.000
Some of us thought it would be a fad, but it's still going for some.

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:15.000
Yeah, speaking of Kickstarter, episode 8 out of 9 for Video Game High School.

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:19.000
So the last episode of this season is going to be on Thursday.

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:24.000
Can't wait, because it's been kind of frustrating.

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:28.000
And hopefully it's going to, well, better turn around for the last episode.

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:31.000
But yeah, I've liked it so far, though.

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:37.000
Alright. Well, that is going to bring to close another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:42.000
But before we say goodnight, of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and say goodnight.

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:46.000
Alan, I want to thank you for joining us in the studio tonight.

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:49.000
And your wit and humor is always appreciated on the show.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:50.000
Thank you.

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000
Bring more of it next time. You're really funny.

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:53.000
Yeah.

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:54.000
I want the listeners to hear more of it.

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000
I've been making dinner for like the last 20 minutes.

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
Oh, understandable.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.000
Do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:05.000
Strawberry pinkberry in the freezer. It's awesome.

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:08.000
And the apartment is really clean, and I have laundry to fold. That's it.

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:11.000
And that was really all you. I was a lazy bitch today.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:16.000
And Alan was like, I'm going to clean. Although I did get the bed propped up and all that stuff.

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:21.000
And we need more people on our Origin friends list for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
Soon, soon.

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:27.000
If you're in the oil army, message me or Sky.

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:28.000
Do you have your name?

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.000
I'm AlanAlchemy78 on Origin.

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:32.000
Alright. There you go.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:33.000
So play with us.

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:34.000
Play with me.

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:37.000
Although my galaxy is already at 100%.

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
Still, multiplayer is really fun.

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:40.000
Especially with friends.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:43.000
Anyhow, Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:50.000
I don't even know how much money those guys must have thrown at this crappy game in order to get it finished in that amount of time.

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:56.000
Because I'm on the first challenge right now, which is a fine 480's themed with lunchboxes.

03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:00.000
And I found one in like the last three hours.

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:07.000
I don't even know how it's possible. They must have spent hundreds of dollars on this.

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:10.000
And it's fucking boring.

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:11.000
I hate this game.

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
So much.

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:16.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:19.000
I have a little bit of brain freeze.

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:20.000
And Garris.

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:24.000
My final thought tonight is Happy Canada Day.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000
First, I would like to learn how to speak.

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:28.000
Poutine!

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Second, Happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:36.000
I'm hoping to come visit your country again.

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:39.000
I had an absolute blast time in my life last time I was there.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:40.000
Which was six years ago.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
Which was far too long.

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
And last time was Vancouver.

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
And next time I'm thinking Toronto.

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:47.000
Right Alan?

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:48.000
Yes.

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:49.000
So we'll see.

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:53.000
So yes, Happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
And the not so beautiful ones too.

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:59.000
Although I saw nothing but good looking people when I was in Vancouver.

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:05.000
I will also say Happy 4th of July to my fellow Americans this week.

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:06.000
Be safe.

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:09.000
Please do not set people's roofs on fire.

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:12.000
If you're going to do fireworks, especially illegal ones.

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
Have your bucket of water ready.

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000
And just frickin' be safe with it.

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.000
Don't blow your finger off.

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
Don't be stupid.

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:22.000
The 4th of July is not to celebrate stupidity.

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.000
What if G asked if you ever said what the secret was?

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:26.000
What secret?

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000
You said that you had a secret?

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:29.000
That I went back to Final Fantasy XI.

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:30.000
Oh, okay.

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
Did you know that before tonight?

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:33.000
Yeah, actually I did.

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:34.000
How did you know?

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
Because I saw your thing pop up.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:37.000
Sky is playing.

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Oh.

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
I would have thought you would have said something if that was the case.

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:41.000
Like, addict.

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:42.000
Didn't care.

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000
Loki didn't know.

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:45.000
Alright.

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:46.000
Sorry.

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:52.000
If someone does want to help me with this, all they have to do is they can play the app

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:56.000
Ultimate Collector and then send me energy.

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:57.000
Or money.

03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:01.000
I got a frown from Acidic Vampire because I'm only talking about PC Mass Effect.

03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000
And you will only plug the PC Mass Effect.

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
Of course, I still play on 360 too.

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:08.000
In fact, my unlocks on 360 are way better.

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:09.000
And guess what I did?

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:10.000
What?

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.000
I brought back your game.

03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:13.000
Yay!

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:14.000
You know what's sad?

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:17.000
Even though I have one and two on PC now, I think I'm going to do the replays on Xbox

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:20.000
to get the rest of the achievements because I'm sad.

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:22.000
Whore.

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.000
Alright, that's it.

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.000
If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you didn't, help spread the word.

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:29.000
That's all we ask.

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
You know, we don't put commercials in the show.

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:35.000
All we ask, spread the word, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio, help grow

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
our family.

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:38.000
We had a new caller tonight.

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.000
We had some new faces tonight in chat.

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:44.000
I really want to thank all you guys for taking the time out to listen to Orange Lounge Radio

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
and help grow.

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:52.000
Ten more years started tonight and it'll continue next week on Alan's Birthday Show.

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:53.000
Yay!

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:56.000
Except, not really, but that's what we're going to call it anyway.

03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.000
Have a great night everybody.

03:13:58.000 --> 03:13:59.000
See you next time.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
See you next time.

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
See you next week.
