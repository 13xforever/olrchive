13902	19128	Tonight, July 15, 2012, a popular comic book character is getting his own game.
19609	26537	One PC game claims an Apple iOS game stole from them without permission, and Amazon announces a new gaming service.
31607	37531	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37831	39873	Yes, it's Orange Launch Radio, just like the intro said.
40333	46057	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all that fun stuff with my co-host.
46457	49199	Joining me here, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
49539	49739	Hi.
50119	51260	How are you, Jamie Summers?
51420	51941	Caffeinated.
52401	52881	Welcome back.
53081	54082	You weren't here last week.
54202	54682	Feeling better?
55143	56944	I felt like crap last week.
57264	57805	Sorry to hear it.
57985	59826	I feel infinitely better this week.
60867	61387	Glad to hear it.
62227	62627	So yes.
62687	63868	And then you'll be gone next week.
64208	66148	Yes, I will be at Tiara's wedding.
66268	69449	You have a great time off program through the network, don't you?
70630	77372	No, I suppose a wedding between two people that inadvertently met because of Orange Lounge Radio could be acceptable.
77892	78352	Not really.
78532	80293	We can't take that much credit, but sort of.
80653	81033	Sort of.
81053	81893	A little bit.
82273	83474	One thing leads to another.
83494	83954	That's right.
85275	86916	I'm also joining us here in studio.
86936	88257	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
88477	88698	Hi.
89398	89818	Hi, Loki.
89838	90179	How are you?
90679	91460	Doing fine.
91700	96824	Going through my spam and trying to delete 20 pages of spam.
97005	97805	I hate spam.
98125	101088	Why can't we... Why can't the internet stop spam?
101328	101909	That's what I want to know.
101929	104131	Spam in the place where you were.
104231	107073	Why won't Howie Mandel stop emailing me about...
108354	108814	What is it?
109015	110796	You have been selected to be on Deal or No Deal.
111196	112317	Oh, I know.
112377	114979	I just keep ignoring him over and over.
115540	117381	And here they really want me on Deal or No Deal.
117441	122565	My favorite is the mailbag address for the show here, mailbag at orangelustradio.com.
122886	124467	We get all this French spam.
124687	125888	Like, it's not just spam.
126569	127709	It's en fran√ßais.
128590	131192	Like, who signed us up for French spam?
131332	131952	I hate you.
132332	133373	I personally hate you.
133393	134393	Let's see what else we got here.
134793	136494	Are you losing money on your website?
136895	139756	The 100% all-natural metabolism booster.
139856	142498	Incredibly low prices on 2011 cars.
142538	147060	What does that have to... Maybe that's how we can make money with VOG.
147120	149161	Don't you kids want some metabolism boosters?
150002	151883	How would you like to have a bigger dick?
154864	155925	We sell them detachable.
156678	158359	Is your car hurting your pocket?
158779	161621	I wish Spamusement was still around.
161661	164463	That was my favorite webcomic back in the day.
164543	169406	Like, with all due respect, screw Penny Arcade, forget the oatmeal.
169886	172047	It was all about Spamusement back in the day.
172908	173788	Get a bigger flute.
174388	175669	Actually, the site is still up.
175709	176810	They just haven't updated it.
177070	178191	I know.
178211	179892	You are so good to me, Eggplant Mike.
181353	182494	That was my favorite.
182554	183055	Alright, anyhow.
184396	185938	Welcome to Internet Jokes from 2004.
187120	188321	Hey, chat room!
188621	190023	You guys are here, you're current.
190203	190644	Welcome.

214456	217377	Although, you can now check in to the podcast as well.
217397	218337	That's been going for a couple weeks.
218477	220058	I have a little more on that in a minute.
220638	223199	But first, let's do tonight's kickoff topic.
224653	227554	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
246474	259297	We were talking about theater and all that stuff, but one of the other things we talked about towards the end of the show, kind of, like I don't want to say it's a throwaway, but it was one of those things where we were like, oh, we hear about things like this all the time and whatever, and it was about this system.
259337	261638	When we were joking, it was called the Oh Yeah!
262078	262978	Oh Yeah!
263218	264958	We were looking at the name, we were like, the Oh Yeah?
265059	266199	The Oh Yeah?
266299	267239	The Oh Yeah?
267599	268599	How about Oh Yeah?
268699	270000	So we started calling it the Oh Yeah!
270320	271600	And we were like, whatever.
271680	274841	You know, we hear about these little consoles all the time.
274961	275161	Well,
276519	277159	Thanks for watching!
293809	314791	and it's all for this console that technically doesn't exist yet and it's had a lot of interesting upsies and downsies going on like for example you know obviously the up part is you know thousands of people are pre-ordering it causing it to go through five million dollars kickstarters just kicked back and made what about a quarter million dollars half a million dollars off of them um
316525	321269	The downs are that we don't really have an actual system.
321509	323390	We have prototypes, imaginings.
324191	336500	We also have screenshots of proposed things that will come to the system, and one of them is Minecraft, to which Notch, the guy behind Minecraft, came out and said, actually, no, we're not putting Minecraft on this.
336580	340803	I mean, they might be talking about Minecraft Android Edition or whatever, but that sucks.
340843	342004	We're not supporting it anymore.
342604	343945	It's not going to be on Oya.
344545	349987	And their response is basically, well, just tell these companies what you want.
350648	352688	Tell them what you want, what you really, really want.
353249	356790	And we'll magically get all these games to show up on the console.
356810	357210	You know what?
357610	358471	I wanted a Phantom.
359471	360732	My chances sound just as good.
361852	362072	All right.
362392	370656	Well, in a funny, interesting twist of fate, Loki, tell us about your story with this console this week.
371878	374260	I backed it right as it came up.
375681	377422	What made you decide that it's worth it?
377462	379644	Because I don't know, for some reason it just kind of surprised me.
380965	384968	Because it's cheap, at the very least.
385429	392154	Because it's so hackable, if the console part of it just kind of fails and they do deliver on the product.
392874	395336	I believe that there still will be stuff that will be supported on it.
395737	401401	I think there's already a lot of games that would be supported on it, especially ones that support Bluetooth controllers and that kind of thing.
403315	404736	Um, so there's that.
404776	423785	And then of course, like I said, the hackable part where you could basically turn this into like a streaming box or, or if you want to, you know, go that far, you could say, turn it into, um, almost like a web TV type thing, you know, where it's hooked up to your TV and you're, you know, checking Facebook, you know, Twitter, that kind of stuff on it.
424486	427047	Um, because I don't really have anything.
427087	428328	I mean, let me put it this way.
429328	447038	I've been using the Xbox 360 recently to watch YouTube for my son we stream episodes of Caillou because they're like five minutes long and that app fucking sucks I have to reboot the app every time a video ends because it starts stuttering the next video
448258	449239	And it pisses me off.
449319	450720	My phone doesn't have that problem.
451300	454162	You know, our Nook tablet doesn't have that problem.
454442	456044	My iPod doesn't have that problem.
456224	460366	But this fucking app that they put out on an Xbox 360 just sucks balls.
460927	464029	So I'd rather have something that would work for streaming, that kind of stuff.
464369	472295	Or, you know, I don't necessarily want to dig out my PS3 or my 360 because it's not always hooked up to the TV to stream video from my computer.
472495	476978	And then I could do that with, you know, an app for, say, VLC player or something like that.
478178	483701	I have something that does all of that and it didn't cost me anything.
484181	487362	I have a computer hooked up to my TV that was just given to us because they were going to throw it away.
488062	488743	It does all of that.
489643	491844	Okay, yes, I can go dumpster diving for a computer.
491864	495345	It was given to me, I didn't dumpster dive for it.
495465	499947	But to be fair, you are kind of dancing around the fact that there is a value to that.
500267	502128	Somebody gave it to you for free because they like you.
502508	505610	If you want to go out and get a computer... I could build the same thing for under $100.
507396	509097	Well, let's go down that road.
509177	510138	Why not a PC?
510258	512120	Why this box?
512180	513341	And I want to hear it out.
513361	514562	I want to hear all sides to this.
514582	514842	Why not a PC?
514862	516703	Because I don't know where I sit with this, honestly.
516943	518565	I could build a PC and put it in there.
518645	522247	But the thing is, I'd rather have something smaller and compact.
522287	523028	And it looks nice.
523648	524749	And it could play games on it.
524829	527031	Yeah, I could easily do that.
527111	534136	Or I could just stick with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and not have to pay anything to have it streamed to my TV.
534256	536078	But at the same time, I can use this...
536658	537599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
553252	561679	Back in the OLR mansion, when you and I lived together, we actually had a computer hooked up to the TV that we used to feed chat room to the living room, remember?
561960	571629	Yeah, it was because it was in the arcade cabinet, so it served like a double purpose, or I could wheel out the arcade cabinet that I have into the living room, but I don't really want to do that.
572298	577040	Well, like, our computer that's hooked up to our TV is in an unobtrusive location.
577660	581201	You can't really, you don't really notice it unless you're looking down at it.
581902	589064	You know, we've got the remote, our keyboard is one of those little clamshell things that Logitech puts out.
589625	591225	And it's completely unobtrusive.
591265	593846	We watch full movies on it in HD quality.
594467	597608	You know, never have any lag unless it's the internet that's lagging.
598989	600290	We've played games on it too.
600350	603953	Dan's got emulators hooked up to it, Pin Mame, all kinds of stuff.
605614	611398	It would run most of the stuff that's on Steam right now, especially the indie games.
612359	616943	On top of that, if any of our friends wants to bring over a computer and hook it up to our TV, the connections are there.
616983	618444	Just change out the wires.
619184	625469	We don't have to buy a vapor, something that doesn't exist and probably won't be worth the money.
625649	627391	How do you feel about Apple TV?
628636	628958	DarkSakura.com
631877	659402	I was just curious because to me there's a lot of similarities between the two except one of them is not coming from a little indie company it's coming from you know the biggest company in America or one or two I don't know them and Exxon keep flip-flopping but whatever you get my point you know one of them is coming from the biggest company anywhere and the other one is you know this company nobody's heard of but essentially they're kind of the same thing it's just that Apple TV doesn't do games yet but I think we all know that'll be built in eventually and
661583	687715	and then it's just going to be the Apple fans versus the anti-Apple crowd all over again I think there's a lot of startups and stuff and everybody seems to focus on the Phantom and consoles of that sort that flopped because they don't know who these people are but the guy that's doing the design is behind that one laptop per child that wasn't vaporware people were paying money for that to get a $50 laptop or whatever and that ended up turning out just fine
688015	692778	So he has a little bit of reputation to uphold there.
692798	694499	It was something established and tangible.
695820	698161	Yes, I understand that, but it wasn't when people were ordering it.
698561	699282	It wasn't made yet.
699542	701323	But laptops existed at the time.
701663	707266	I understand that, but to create a laptop that's that cheap with parts, it was very customized.
707647	709268	I mean, try building a laptop for $50.
710068	710448	Good luck.
711289	711649	Been done.
713519	715640	Alright, let's see this laptop that you've done.
715680	719423	I'm not building them, I'm just saying that people have been doing it.
719443	722365	You make it sound like it's so goddamn fucking easy to find a $50 laptop.
722385	724486	Let me just pull one out of my asshole right here.
724546	725126	Let me jump in.
726627	728448	I truly do feel like I'm neutral on this topic.
729389	733111	I kinda want one, but I gotta see it in action first.
733211	737294	And I don't wanna see theories and maybes and possibles.
737634	739415	I want it on the E3 show floor.
739756	740596	And I want it to be...
742037	744058	The public to give an honest opinion on it.
744118	744998	That's where I'm at.
745298	751080	But I'm not quite in the camp of no way, no how, never either or that it's like a waste.
751100	751880	I'm kind of in between.
752120	767445	But to be fair, I have heard these stories about the kids in countries where they don't have a lot of money in the education system about that there are these charity programs that are getting these super cheap laptops that are like $7,500 in these classrooms.
767485	768725	Yes, that's that laptop.
769165	778029	Yeah, I mean, so they're not great, but to say, yes, there is a such thing as a $100 laptop, but they're not exactly going to do much, but textbooks.
778049	781170	You can buy a smartphone for, you know, $75 to $100.
781670	788833	It may not be like all the things that my iPhone are, but it'll do all the same stuff the laptop will.
789293	792995	I mean, if they can put them in a phone, they can build a laptop, right?
794605	794945	DarkSakura.com
812310	812910	Operating system.
812930	820273	Basically, it's got the same specs or very similar specs to the new quad-core processor tablet that they have coming out.
820313	822734	So it's like a tablet that's hooked up to a TV.
822894	829797	Would it be correct to say that basically what Ouya's going to do is it's going to be a smartphone on your TV without the phone calls?
830577	834679	It's going to be a tablet on your TV without... And without touchscreen capability.
835859	836820	Which all these games run on.
837500	842064	Which I'm okay with, actually, because I'm over touchscreen games.
842704	846967	And you were talking about this during Bobby's show, and Bobby was kind of grilling you on this too.
846987	852071	You were mentioning you want to play some of these games that are on PC and stuff right now.
852111	853632	Let's say a game like Terraria.
853872	857015	But you want to play it with a controller on your TV, the way games are meant to be played.
857035	859296	I have a controller that I use for Steam.
860317	861638	But not every game supports it.
863024	866045	So, we don't always get what we want.
867005	883490	I can understand the angle of wanting to play things on your couch in the living room as opposed to in your, because it would be hypocritical of me to say I don't understand that viewpoint because I've purposely bought games on the console because I want to plop my fat ass on the couch, kick back, and have my Xbox controller and play.
883570	886791	There's plenty of games I've wanted to play on the console, but it's just not realistic to do it.
888491	910377	especially in my case since I physically have a problem with it but I mean you know I could have gone out and you know paid for example I could have bought Mass Effect for 12 bucks or paid five dollars like I did for it you know or eleven dollars for the two games together on on Amazon sale and get the collector's edition and play through all kinds of ways of it
910857	911738	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
932826	936208	$5 million has been raised in a week, less than a week.
937088	939870	You can't deny that's a huge deal.
940150	942631	Whether you support it or not, that's a huge deal.
943191	948374	My question is, what is the possible, if any, long-term impact on the next gaming cycle?
948914	954416	Do you think Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo is looking at this going, huh?
954997	958298	Or do you think, eh, don't care, we could step on these guys?
958558	960119	They're looking at it going, no one care.
960860	961740	I don't think they care at all.
963149	963630	Interesting.
964010	977444	But here's the thing though, if this does become popular, because I'm not going to say 50,000 consoles or even 80,000 consoles, it's not necessarily going to be a big splash.
977625	979607	I mean it's good for what it is.
980888	983850	But let's say it gives developers an alternative.
984390	985831	They can say, you know what?
986291	989052	I don't want to try to get my stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.
989172	1006781	I don't want to try to get myself on the WiiWare service or whatever they're calling it for the Wii U. I don't want to try to have to negotiate these really crazy deals or even licensing with these publishers because they're going to try to have too much creative control or whatever.
1007461	1007821	DarkSakura.com.
1016147	1018749	And yeah, you could do it with Xbox, indie games, and stuff like that.
1018869	1021651	And I really wish there was more services like that, because that would be awesome.
1022451	1030136	But there's not, so you kind of have to... That's why you have all these companies going and saying, Hey, fuck this.
1030276	1031157	We're going to Kickstarter.
1031777	1036380	We want to make this game genre that is not popular with publishers.
1036440	1039222	That's why you see some of these games going to Kickstarter.
1039662	1055874	I do think the success this thing is seeing so far without there even being a product to touch is obviously people are very into the dream of what they can do with this console and for me it's a very loud statement against
1056394	1064299	Some of the things we've heard about the next series of consoles, such as you won't be able to play used games, it'll be digital only.
1064599	1074345	Whether these facts are true or not, there are things that have been kicked around there in the internet about these next rounds of consoles and have caused a lot of reaction.
1074925	1079668	And you know what we always say, if you want to make the biggest statement possible, vote with your wallet.
1080208	1097348	Well, in a way, now that we have this console out that is basically saying we are the antithesis, we don't even exist, but we are promising that we will not be that console you all are dreading in the future, and they've raised $5 million like that?
1099211	1100372	That's a big statement to me.
1101775	1102436	from the internet.
1103596	1114985	And that's the only thing I think I would be worried about if I was Nintendo, Sony, or Xbox is that whether you personally agree with it or not, people are voting with their wallets right now.
1117153	1121616	Now, granted, $5 million is probably a kick in the bucket when you're Microsoft, but still.
1122416	1123136	Here's the other thing, too.
1123997	1125378	I completely forgot.
1126258	1127139	Didn't even consider this.
1127279	1131241	GameGuru brings up, what if Google released a $99 Android console?
1132041	1133182	Especially if this does well.
1133322	1136324	Can you imagine the power of Google saying, hey, you know what?
1136344	1140346	We're going to take that cool little tablet that we made and we're going to just put it into a console.
1140546	1147448	Well, technically, I mean, they did, they created that stupid sphere-looking thing that you can now get, but that's $300, you know, for streaming content.
1147488	1152369	But what if they were to do something similar to that, saying, hey, now you can game on your couch.
1152449	1155429	You can, you know, you can game with this console.
1155469	1167092	You can, you know, Facebook, all the stuff that you can do with, like, WebTV, all in this wonderful console that's low price, and you get access to the Android Marketplace and that kind of stuff.
1169595	1173056	All right, going to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
1173096	1179198	Breakman says, Microsoft is looking at the OUYA and thinking about running a company contest to see who can make the most fun of it.
1180298	1186881	You know, one thing Microsoft does very well is they take other people's ideas and make them better and then release it.
1186941	1196844	That's one thing Microsoft's been doing for quite a while, and some might debate me on that point, but that's another thing I think Microsoft would be looking at this going, hmm.
1198084	1206127	But, I mean, the whole free-to-play model, if I understand correctly, it's no different from Xbox Live's model right now.
1206247	1209369	It's not necessarily that all games are free-to-play forever.
1209809	1217832	It's just that all games have to have a free-to-play download that you can unlock all levels for five bucks or whatever they go with it.
1217932	1219073	Well, here's the thing, too.
1219093	1225898	On Kotaku this week, they've been having their little discussions about the Ouya and that kind of stuff.
1225978	1233263	Seriously, every single one is just trying to talk people out of buying one or backing it or something like that.
1233643	1241028	And one of their concerns was piracy, which, yes, piracy does exist, probably quite prevalent on the Android marketplace.
1241408	1245251	Has that stopped games from doing well on Android?
1245271	1245371	No.
1245391	1245471	No.
1247632	1273597	and then also the way they're kind of doing these games right now is you know they make it a little bit harder to just simply pirate something they have you know the in-app purchases so basically you have to download this free-to-play version and then you unlock it within the app so that would be a little bit harder to crack than just say you know I'm gonna buy this five dollar game and here's the full version you know apk file or something like that for it so
1275154	1276195	There's that, I guess.
1276455	1277796	That's a little bit helpful.
1279517	1283499	Alright, there was another comment that was made early on that I thought was pretty accurate.
1283779	1292245	Breakman also said this at live.vognetwork.com When Loki's son reaches eight, he will be the coolest kid in the neighborhood because his dad will have the coolest shit.
1292605	1296107	You basically said you're buying this to entertain your son with in a large way.
1296487	1296948	Kinda.
1297868	1298869	Myself, really.
1298889	1299069	Yeah.
1301055	1303481	But if it helps to watch the kid too, then hey, right?
1303642	1306469	Well, yeah, I mean, because he likes his Caillou.
1307271	1309397	His Canadian children's television.
1311703	1319467	I wasn't sure if I wanted to go here with this other... I mean, it's not in tonight's show role, but it's another Kickstarter.
1319507	1322128	And this one, this one's a tricky one.
1322208	1322909	You know what's funny?
1323009	1327591	I got a text message this week, and I forgot to reply to it because I received it while I was dead asleep.
1327651	1329593	I should probably reply to it now that it's been three days later.
1330133	1335296	One of my friends texted me saying, Hey, what's OLR's aversion to crowdsourced funding?
1335976	1339698	OMG, hope I'm not waking you up, although they did wake me up and I forgot to reply because of it.
1339738	1341498	But what is the aversion to crowdsource funding?
1341818	1348681	I don't necessarily have an aversion to crowdsource funding, but I just, there's a lot of things that make me very nervous about Kickstarter.
1349582	1358145	And I think is that A, Kickstarter pockets a large chunk of change from, I mean, 5% out of 5 million is a large chunk of change.
1358581	1360182	But let's be honest here.
1360322	1362423	It's not any different than doing PayPal donations.
1362503	1365024	PayPal pockets a large chunk of that too.
1365285	1369487	I'm not sure everybody... Well, let me simplify it this way.
1370945	1375831	An artist once said around 1996, mo' money, mo' problems.
1377112	1379915	And I think that's what a lot of people get into.
1380115	1384981	They're asking for this money, but I think sometimes not everybody necessarily knows how to spend that money.
1385521	1391708	They think they know how to spend it, but then a lot of these Kickstarters are making way over the amount that they're asking for.
1392409	1413243	and I'm not sure people know what to do with that money like one of Kickstarter's biggest problems is they need to have a place where you actually stop making money like they need to maybe this is built in I've just never seen it no they don't have that they have stretch goals that's weird to me and of course why would Kickstarter want to put that in if you're making a runaway money they're getting 5% of it all they want you to make millions
1415169	1427033	I expressed vocal dissent one time, and I hate doing this because it was another podcast, but I have to openly ask, why does a podcast need to raise, what the hell were they asking for?
1427653	1429494	In all, they had raised six digits.
1429854	1433875	This podcast raised something like $180,000, and I don't have it in front of me.
1434215	1435096	I'll look it up in a minute here.
1436336	1446904	They said it was because they were going to have a studio space and all this stuff that they need to revive their podcast.
1446964	1448945	Which was how many episodes before that?
1448965	1450666	I think it was like maybe a year.
1451227	1453989	Yeah, and I personally found that to be insulting.
1454249	1459593	As a podcaster, I found it to be insulting that if you want to podcast, you need money to do it.
1460633	1462073	That much money anyway.
1462714	1464114	Because you really don't.
1464774	1466394	You need a little money, sure.
1466674	1470655	But if you want to make the reunion happen, you just fucking do it.
1470975	1474916	You don't force people to pay $100,000 to have it done.
1474936	1475696	That's insulting.
1475776	1481697	A perfect example of a podcast raising money for a legitimate purpose.
1482798	1484598	It was a Mom Gamers podcast.
1485018	1485539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1502070	1506095	The Necessities, mics, and recording equipment.
1506336	1507958	This podcast raised over $130,000 and they were asking for $30,000.
1508018	1508879	They needed $30,000 to do a podcast.
1508899	1508959	And...
1517578	1519159	I kind of thought that was horse shit.
1519239	1519599	Sorry.
1520079	1522660	That was, I want this to be a paying job.
1523240	1524380	But people bought into it.
1524741	1526581	I guess the quality of this show is good enough.
1526601	1527822	People are that attached to it.
1528062	1528662	Or people want the rewards.
1528682	1530302	That people paid five times over.
1530422	1532043	So hats off.
1532103	1532523	Congrats.
1532563	1533203	You made it work.
1533404	1534244	You found the answer.
1534284	1535604	How to make money off podcasting.
1535664	1536164	Congrats.
1536505	1537605	I hope the profit was worth it.
1540276	1541878	All Games had a different plan in mind.
1541958	1544281	They wanted to make a full network.
1556197	1582732	personally I don't think they needed $45,000 but that's neither here nor there it's a done deal now I still would support them in that effort I understand why they thought big and I can respect that dream big or go home right and that's what they did my previous rant was not about that so don't start shit anyhow that wasn't even the thing I wanted to talk about god damn
1583943	1587265	Yes, I want to talk about the Penny Arcade Kickstarter.
1587526	1589087	You know exactly where I was going with this.
1592469	1595971	So their Kickstarter was to remove advertising off their website.
1596031	1599934	To remove ads from their website is, and I'm trying to bring it up right here.
1601909	1627695	Penny Arcade wants to raise and this one was really interesting they really thought about this because they made the goal $250,000 but that's only to get rid of one ad on the site if you want to get rid of all the ads they got to make $999,999 it's a million basically one dollar short of a million if they raise that much on Kickstarter they're going to do all of Penny Arcade ad free and
1631798	1637267	And I... There's this interesting angle they're going with it where they don't want to work for advertisers.
1637307	1638569	They want to work for you.
1639811	1640673	I can respect that.
1640733	1641814	It's a different way of thinking.
1643858	1644118	But...
1647389	1650370	This is the same group that's brought us Penny Arcade Expo.
1651730	1656451	They brought us the Child's Play charity, which are two great things.
1656932	1659212	I can't say anything bad about either of those things.
1659532	1664554	Penny Arcade Expo gave E3 Iran for its money and still is in some regards.
1664614	1665194	That's huge.
1666994	1669896	Child's Play, obviously a hugely important great thing.
1669956	1672257	It's a necessary thing in the gaming industry.
1672277	1673037	They brought us that.
1673417	1674598	So these are two great things.
1675018	1681501	But then I kind of go, well, Penny Arcade with all this stuff that they built isn't exactly an indie darling anymore.
1683041	1683582	You know what I mean?
1683602	1684282	Mm-hmm.
1685485	1686645	I'm just kind of like, hmm.
1706522	1716925	I get the Kickstarter's not really supposed to be about the rewards, but if you're investing in a website, if you're basically giving them money, what are you really getting in return?
1718672	1719933	And apparently they don't understand.
1719993	1721493	Kickstarter is about the rewards.
1721533	1726756	That's kind of why people... People like the pre-order bonuses for things.
1726976	1733198	And so that's why they... It's kind of the incentive to get you the back money for these things.
1733779	1739041	And some of them... I remember on the Penny Arcade one, which someone mentioned...
1739361	1741783	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1765511	1769893	And honestly, if they're retweeting something that you said, who gives a shit what you said?
1770193	1772054	I mean, you're going to say, oh, retweet it from them?
1773354	1773994	Who is this person?
1774154	1775595	I don't know.
1776415	1780337	Someone following Penny Arcade isn't going to go, oh my god, they retweeted this person.
1780457	1782817	I need to follow them, become best friends with them.
1783098	1783918	No one gives a shit.
1784975	1791199	RDG Singe in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm under the impression that Penny Arcade was already profitable.
1791299	1791980	I'm sure it is.
1792500	1798284	But what they want to do, they want to take out the ads and have the people pay for it because they want to be a business that's run by the people.
1798664	1799245	And I get that.
1799305	1800886	On paper, that sounds like a great idea.
1801586	1813414	And maybe the answer for why would you give $5,000 is, well, it's about supporting the community and it's about supporting this not just comic strip, but organization that I really like.
1814635	1817939	But I'm like, well, can't you support them through ads too?
1818339	1820361	If you support the website, click on the ads.
1820561	1821522	Check out the sponsors.
1821662	1823164	That's another way to do it.
1823204	1824065	That'll make them money too.
1824285	1825706	Or advertise on their site.
1825746	1827909	But Penny Arcade wants to.
1829190	1830751	That's a conscious decision on their part.
1830791	1833774	They want to not have that be the way people support them anymore.
1834055	1835276	They want to cut out the middleman.
1837338	1838259	It's interesting.
1839426	1839826	I don't know.
1839986	1840987	I don't know what to think about it.
1841607	1846568	I'm not exactly going to donate, but I think it's interesting.
1846668	1848529	I will continue to donate to Child's Play.
1848629	1851530	I will continue to support the Child's Play events.
1851610	1854391	I will continue to attend Penny Arcade Expo when I can.
1854731	1858892	I'll continue to read the website and click on an ad when it looks interesting, but Kickstarter, not my thing.
1861413	1861933	But that's just me.
1864392	1867074	City Vampire says, why donate money to remove ads?
1867134	1869775	Something gaming related would be much more preferable.
1870496	1881702	If they'd done this, because wasn't that Penny Arcade Volume 3 in trouble for a long time and it took them a long time to find a person that would actually make it because the first two didn't do so hot or something like that?
1882022	1887306	I don't want to make stuff up, but I know the third game took a long time and it came from somebody else and it has kind of a different look to it.
1887726	1888786	And is way better.
1888907	1889587	Why didn't they just fund...
1891548	1895389	A potential Penny Arcade 4 or whatever, Penny Arcade other thing through this.
1896770	1898410	It's interesting.
1898791	1907694	Or better yet, they have a card game coming out that's based on one of their comics as well in Kickstarter, but it's some other company putting it out that licensed it from Penny Arcade.
1907954	1910915	I'm not sure if Penny Arcade's making, I'm sure they're making some money off of it.
1912651	1912991	I don't know.
1914432	1918015	I think a lot of the stuff that they do, they sell merchandise.
1918215	1922818	They sell stuff to help fund their organization.
1923018	1925420	I know now that they're a lot bigger than they used to be.
1925480	1927121	They have their own offices.
1927241	1934946	Obviously, they can run these conventions, which I'm sure are pretty expensive, but I'm sure they're making money off of them as well.
1935387	1935847	Otherwise, they
1937543	1946988	I'm not going to say that they're not going to run them because they're not profitable, but they wouldn't be expanding if they weren't profitable.
1948028	1955572	You know what else is weird about this whole Kickstarter is that they have these stretch goals that are at 1.1 million and 1.3 million and 1.4 million, and they're locked.
1955952	1956712	They're a mystery.
1956772	1957833	It's a secret to everyone.
1957853	1959674	You don't get to know what they are until they hit those goals.
1959694	1963656	I'm kind of like, in what investment world do you get to keep these kinds of secrets?
1966873	1976863	If this was a non-Kickstarter investment in the real world type of thing, I think there's laws and stuff that prevent these kinds of secrets.
1976903	1978464	You have to disclose these things.
1979725	1980586	It's weird to me.
1980646	1981647	It's a different way of thinking.
1983369	1983649	I don't know.
1985091	1998941	Anyhow, alright, I'm done talking about Kickstarters and all that, it was a big intro to the show But it's really a huge part of what's going on in the gaming world this week So, it keeps going We missed the Mac vs. PC debate in the chatroom Really?
1999681	1999782	Still?
1999802	2008688	Yeah, well no, it's over, it's just You know what, the biggest people who don't, who are all anti-Apple are not graphic designers
2009980	2013662	Thank you GameGuru for filling in the gap that made me look ignorant there.
2013963	2018486	Penny Arcade 3 is being made by The Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World People.
2018906	2021268	Not exactly a big budget, but actually a good fit.
2022248	2022628	Thank you.
2022829	2023829	And it's pretty awesome.
2023909	2026731	It's very much like the old school Final Fantasy games.
2026911	2029793	It's actually already out on Xbox Live Indie Games, so go check it out.
2030274	2033796	I mean, I kind of wanted to check it out because I like those type of games.
2034196	2036037	Not because I'm necessarily a Penny Arcade fan.
2036358	2039380	I mean, I like their comics, but I don't read them every week.
2039680	2039860	Right.
2041101	2042082	Mass Effect
2059779	2060620	Still?
2061080	2082515	Oh wait, no, you weren't here to tell us about how you... I beat it on Tuesday, then I played WoW for like an hour, then I went back and started modding my save file, and figured out how to use the... Because the big thing for 3 is that they had a default FemShep with all the special textures and everything like the dude one had, which is about damn time, except her face looked like a brick.
2083235	2086878	But the textures were really good, except she also looked overmade like, you know, a cheap hooker.
2088311	2101806	But I did figure out how to make my own face shape and everything so that she basically doesn't have a head the shape of a brick and applied the textures to it and then custom hairs that other characters in the game have.
2102247	2107433	I also found out how to make Ashley's hair work on her, but her hair is like a shoulder item for armor.
2108113	2111696	I also found the... I've got to do a few tweaks to get it to work.
2112156	2117940	I found how to use the hooker outfit, like the dancer outfits from Afterlife.
2118201	2118481	Hot.
2119241	2121603	So it's actually one of the underwears.
2122744	2125146	So when you said you beat Mass Effect, you're talking about Mass Effect 3.
2125286	2125466	Yes.
2125606	2127387	So now you've beaten... Well, I beat Mass Effect 2 the week before.
2127467	2129589	Like me, you've now played the whole series this year.
2129869	2130029	Yes.
2130049	2130770	Beaten all three games.
2131370	2131710	In a month.
2132211	2133572	And now you're into modding them.
2133772	2133972	Yes.
2134192	2134753	Kind of your thing.
2134773	2134853	Yeah.
2135353	2137575	Because I'm going to keep, I'm going to play it as a paragon.
2137695	2139777	I don't really give a shit about playing Bit Shepard.
2140558	2142459	And I don't give a shit about playing as a dude either.
2142659	2143560	I'm going to keep playing.
2144100	2146563	I've done a few renegade options just out of curiosity.
2146583	2148384	You are in the Fem Shep is the only Shep camp.
2149585	2150486	Yeah, I guess.
2150766	2156251	And, you know, because I have this head cannon, the term I've kept using over and over.
2156611	2158252	I have a head cannon and I'm sticking to it.
2159469	2161831	So, without spoiling, that ending.
2162571	2168115	Now, you are in a unique situation where we're starting to hear people now that are getting into the series.
2168676	2170037	You never saw the original ending.
2170097	2171358	You only saw Extended Cut.
2171458	2173880	I saw part of the original ending, and I did go back and watch it.
2174720	2180224	But yeah, my official first ending was Extended Cut, and I wasn't disappointed.
2180584	2181445	It was just fine.
2182125	2183927	I think it cleared a lot of stuff up.
2184487	2187870	I think it had a definite resolution, and I'm happy with it.
2189971	2207584	I went back and watched some of the other ones online the one I picked was the destroy ending except when I accidentally shot the stupid kid in the head but then my game froze and I got to start over from the decision the other thing I found out by the way with the save file editor is that you can save your autosave files as standard save files
2208244	2228808	so where it loads as your autosave like say that you were at that last decision and you wanted to just to keep going back to that point even though it's not like a standard save you can close the game at that point pull up the gibbed editor and load your autosave and save it as a separate save file so you can always go back to that point in the game pretty cool huh?
2229281	2230021	Yeah, that's interesting.
2230101	2232882	Of course, when I did it, it was on 360 where you don't get to do any of that.
2233662	2235662	Also, Gibbed Editor works for 360.
2235702	2236162	Oh.
2237283	2244524	You can import your files from your 360 if you're saving on the hard drive, run them through Gibbed Editor because it's high, it's PC stuff.
2244544	2245784	Yeah, it's basically PC, yeah.
2245944	2249585	And even do custom hairs, custom textures, all that same type of stuff.
2250485	2254486	Well, you can't load the outside mods, but you can do all the stuff that's hidden in the game.
2254906	2256366	And even change your coalesce bin.
2257667	2258887	You can hack it, pretty much.
2259908	2261549	So, what now, now that Mass Effect's done?
2261569	2264811	I mean, I know you want to do some... Playing through Mass Effect 3 again?
2265771	2272196	You want to do some fan things, but are there any other series that you've overlooked that now you're thinking, maybe I should go back and revisit them?
2272416	2272856	Not really.
2273236	2278700	I mean... Well, and keep in mind, I actually have beaten four games this year, because I beat Portal 2 again a couple of times.
2279761	2282523	And I'm still playing through Fractal.
2283664	2287048	I've decided that I'm interested in WoW again because of the goat mount.
2287748	2291593	I want a riding goat and they better have rectangular pupils because goats are the best.
2293555	2298081	I was on Girls Gone WoW today for their recording and we went long.
2299422	2300944	It was a good show.
2301949	2303289	Awesome, girlsgotwild.net.
2303349	2304390	You can hear that Wednesdays.
2304570	2305250	It says hi.
2305910	2306370	Hello.
2306410	2306670	Hello.
2309091	2315792	We went over a lot of what we think of the new mounts, and I think we had a general consensus that some of us like it, some of us don't.
2317093	2318493	How's that for a consensus?
2318573	2319013	Of course.
2319193	2320673	Everyone's entitled to like or not like.
2320693	2323034	I'm sure you guys had to talk about the pet battling a little bit.
2323334	2323734	Pokemon.
2323914	2325495	Yeah, straight up Pokemon.
2325515	2327835	But you have to name each of your pets, and how is that going to work?
2327855	2328455	You don't have to.
2328695	2329415	Well, I'm gonna.
2331676	2333138	I'm going to name them all after Supernatural.
2333158	2334259	Just Google cute pet names.
2334279	2336020	I'll have Sam as a pet.
2337482	2343848	But I really, I mean really, except for my hour of wow, hour of wower, I've been playing Mass Effect.
2344129	2345550	And I'm going to keep playing Mass Effect.
2345670	2346491	It's super fun.
2347392	2351336	And I still have 100% galactic readiness on my damn phone.
2352237	2352357	And...
2354860	2366183	My next goal is to figure out how to get Ashley's face texture to work over the Shepard that I have without doing this really weird thing where it scrolls your camera out and clips through everything else.
2367163	2372945	It did, however, show me exactly how some of the levels were laid out as far as their rendered space.
2373185	2373805	So that was kind of neat.
2374144	2376686	And at some point you do really have to check out the multiplayer with friends.
2376926	2377626	I probably will.
2377926	2380908	I just have to make sure that my coalesced bin is fine.
2381208	2387152	But the only thing that I did on that really was set some keybinds for weapons, which I'm probably going to undo.
2387892	2391434	And I have my game hacked for God mode if I wanted it.
2392615	2394016	So I don't really need any of that.
2394416	2397318	Except for the one where you use no fuel.
2397418	2399559	I have the thing set where your fuel is 100.
2399820	2400060	Okay.
2401020	2427687	I mean not at 100 but you use zero and the reapers don't find you as easily that type of thing all right let's move on Loki how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot it's basically just Minecraft this week again um I I like the new update it's very fun and um so I haven't gotten to make any pistons yet but uh you know I'll get there um
2429666	2434229	I also like the new lighting engines.
2434449	2435750	It's a little interesting.
2435770	2437171	I guess it's supposed to be more like PC.
2438231	2444796	And finally, we did start a new world as well with my co-worker because we kind of got tired of playing just in mine.
2446437	2452520	And so we did start a new one and playing that on regular again with monsters and everything.
2452540	2454401	Because I've been playing on peaceful for a long time because I'm...
2455462	2464910	I finally finished my minecart track thing, which goes across the entire map now, and it makes a full circuit.
2464970	2468714	In fact, last night I was working on creating...
2470535	2484559	The Redstone circuits for each stop, it's going to have a delay on it, so the cart gets to the stop, there's about a 10 second delay where the cart stays there and then the cart automatically moves to the next stop, so it's kind of a...
2486883	2490526	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 And you did find a partner for that.
2510865	2511826	I did find a partner.
2513448	2524701	One of my friends, his brother plays a ton of Call of Duty and so he's going to be going down with me to the armpit of California Stockton.
2526229	2527771	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2527871	2528371	Bakersfield.
2528431	2529673	You're not going to Bakersfield.
2530814	2531074	Sorry.
2531895	2533717	What would Stockton be then?
2534758	2537661	Stockton is kind of like... It's that part behind the knee.
2537821	2540283	It's the mole on your butt.
2540363	2541684	Not everybody has moles, Rob.
2543026	2545268	Okay, how about... California has one.
2545308	2546549	How about the belly button?
2546750	2548131	Because the belly button gets kind of stinky.
2549232	2550472	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2569857	2571498	I have my primary weapon I use for everything.
2571558	2574639	Launchers just take out helicopters.
2575259	2578360	I call it my sniper rifle sometimes because that's why I shoot across the map.
2578380	2582262	Sometimes they hit snipers.
2582322	2589164	I've never really bothered with a machine pistol or a pistol because I'm like, when the hell am I going to need this?
2589784	2591325	I'm just going to use my regular gun for everything.
2591345	2594546	If I run out of ammo with my regular gun, I'm going to pick up someone else's gun.
2596420	2596701	I don't know.
2597001	2598363	I still have to figure out what I'm going to do there.
2598603	2600626	Let me talk to him because he knows what he's doing.
2602108	2603450	We got all the rules and everything.
2605813	2608818	It's kind of dumb, some of the restrictions that they have in there.
2609819	2610360	No cheating.
2610834	2611735	No, it's not even cheating.
2611795	2622962	It's like no explosives at all, except no C4, no claymores, no bouncing betties, no launchers, no grenade launcher attachments.
2623243	2626665	There's no recon perk, no...
2629987	2631087	What the hell was the other one?
2631887	2632488	Sitrep.
2633768	2640029	They're going to leave kill cams on for some reason, which is weird.
2640649	2644350	And then some of the maps that they picked are just really huge for two-on-two matches.
2644610	2651512	I'm like, hey, you know, you guys, why don't you guys download the free face-off maps, which, you know...
2653064	2654304	Thanks for watching!
2671004	2677126	But whatever, I will play by their rules, but it's just stupid that they picked these giant maps.
2677206	2679506	Like, Village is terrible for 2-1-2.
2679566	2683947	It's just, okay, I hope I find you because this map is fucking huge.
2684627	2687148	But we'll see, I guess.
2689029	2690269	Anything else for your gaming week?
2691611	2719502	I played a little Grand Theft Auto but just because I was working on my mod because I was talking to someone that helped out with their map modding stuff and just talking to about Grand Theft Auto things I'm like I kind of want to work on Grand Theft Auto again and then I made an outhouse and I got bored so that was that I do need to finish the map mods I've been working on for almost 18 months now so I can at least finish them before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out that's it
2720268	2720608	All right.
2721609	2722249	My gaming week.
2723009	2726291	Actually, I didn't play really anything new, but I revisited old stuff.
2726411	2727611	In fact, really old stuff.
2728012	2731653	Because Alan the other day was like, hey, I'm going to hook up the PlayStation 2.
2732634	2736695	And then he didn't actually do it right away, but it had me thinking about PlayStation 2 games.
2736735	2737756	I kind of wanted to go back and play.
2738216	2740897	So then the other night I was like, Alan, weren't you going to hook up the PlayStation 2?
2741197	2743559	And so he finally found it and hooked it up.
2743959	2745780	And I probably started playing Final Fantasy XII.
2746940	2751381	I don't know why, I just never really played enough of it before, and I was just like, I don't want to play that again.
2751701	2753762	I think I can blame Theatrhythm for that.
2753822	2757663	Remember how I was talking last week about how it's kind of a commercial for Final Fantasy games and makes you want to play them again?
2758163	2762124	I think I can thank Theatrhythm for making me go, you know, I didn't play enough of XII.
2762244	2763284	I'm going to go back and play more of that.
2763704	2765025	So I played a little more of that.
2766425	2773027	The other thing I got is that, you know, as we'll get into more of the details on later in the show, but as I'm sure all you guys know about...
2773427	2775109	There's a Steam sale going on right now.
2775909	2777391	Oh, yeah.
2778151	2779813	As in, give me all your money right now.
2779853	2781014	I'm pretty broke as it is.
2782516	2785478	But I need these games.
2785498	2791924	I can tell you right now, I was looking... Actually, it's funny what you were talking earlier.
2791964	2796469	I was looking through my Steam collection to see what exactly I have.
2797049	2805301	and I can honestly say maybe out of all of these, the Steam copies, I may have played Portal 2, but most of these games I have not played yet.
2806623	2809146	I'm just like... But I need more!
2809327	2810348	I need more!
2811630	2812170	That's awesome.
2812785	2818707	I would be tempted to get Borderlands, but first person shooters make me sick, and Dan, we already have it on Xbox.
2818947	2827611	Right, well, the platform thing didn't stop me, because when Skyrim got discounted to 29 bucks, I was like, I want it on PC, so I bought it.
2827631	2828131	The mods are really cool.
2828151	2828471	DarkSakura.com
2845365	2846906	My PC, well, this laptop.
2846926	2847726	It's pretty.
2848326	2849626	It's so pretty.
2849946	2855408	I need to upgrade my PC, and it's really pissing me off because it's going to be expensive to do that.
2855428	2860110	And I don't ever use my PC anymore, but that PC was meant for, like, games.
2860610	2866252	Well, it was meant for Crysis, and now, of course, it's way outdated because it has old 8800 NVIDIA cards in it.
2867732	2869494	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2889730	2893891	and I have this thing modded for cooling too so I don't know what I'm going to do.
2893971	2908575	Now I'm on this new mission is I really want to get back into Civilization 5 because I need to get the Gods and Kings expansion when it gets discounted again and it was only $8 on Steam the other night so I'm convinced before the 23rd it'll be on sale again and I'm going to buy Alan a copy and make him play with me.
2910663	2917169	But yeah, seriously, anybody that has Borderlands, add me on Steam, because I don't have anybody added at all.
2917389	2919571	We do have a VOG Network group on Steam.
2919631	2920131	We should.
2920151	2921893	You can find Loki through there.
2921933	2924976	I'm thinking we need to work on getting some Borderlands games night going.
2925096	2927138	Because I'm picking up Borderlands 2 when that comes out.
2927358	2929460	Probably not for PC, but on Xbox 360.
2930801	2933283	Because Borderlands is just an awesome game.
2933363	2934304	I do want to go back to it.
2935025	2936946	I'll be playing on Xbox again, but my...
2938547	2940568	My co-worker won't return my copy.
2941569	2943289	So I'm just like, eh, fine.
2943790	2944050	All right.
2945330	2948211	Let's get into some announcements, then we can get into the rest of the gaming news.
2948752	2949152	Announcements.
2949172	2949852	I have a few tonight.
2950212	2953414	First off, the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.
2953434	2957936	I'd like to welcome Critical Myth and British Invaders.
2957956	2958936	I almost said British Invasion.
2959116	2959556	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
2984034	2987758	Also, feedback about the checking into the podcast.
2987838	2990600	A lot of folks missed the check-in word last week.
2991020	2998567	So Bobby and I kind of sat down and talked, and we now have a little chime noise that you're going to hear before the word is given.
2998607	3004833	So that way, those of you guys that are kind of zoning as you're working and you missed the check-in word, you have something to kind of snap out of it and, oh, pay attention.
3005173	3006895	So just throwing that out there.
3006915	3009597	You will now hear a little chime noise before the check-in word.
3009617	3010518	Are we buying borderlands?
3011539	3014043	Did I hear Jamie's buying Borderlands over there?
3014323	3014664	Yes.
3015906	3016566	Good job!
3018149	3022715	Gabe Newell is sitting in an evil lair somewhere going, yes, excellent.
3022815	3024858	Someone needs to buy me Saints Row the Third.
3026541	3027221	Alan bought that.
3028724	3033287	I want to say, I think, I can't remember if Borderlands had a third person view or not.
3033467	3035469	I want to say it did.
3036529	3037230	I thought maybe.
3037570	3044415	I think there's a way to hack it on PC where you run third person, which if you can, because you can do it in Portal 2, you can play Portal 2 third person.
3045175	3050722	All right, the one other announcement I have is that we will be participating in PlayStation Home Summerfest.
3050822	3052664	The VOG Network is participating in that.
3053024	3054386	Be ready on the 29th.
3054526	3055487	That's in two weeks.
3055928	3059532	We are going to be broadcasting in PlayStation Home.
3059772	3060933	Now, I want to make this clear, though.
3061554	3062855	Nothing is, like, changing.
3062895	3066078	You still go to VOG Network and you can, you know, hear our show and everything.
3066118	3067859	And the podcast is still there, like always.
3067899	3068700	That part's not changing.
3069100	3072843	But as we've done on a few nights, we're going to have Home Open as well.
3073223	3075905	We'll be in PlayStation Home fielding questions and so forth.
3075925	3077327	This isn't just the clubhouse, though.
3077727	3083531	This is actually we're going to be out in one of the spaces called Aurora 1.5, which is kind of a trippy little, like...
3084692	3090497	Uh, like flashy colors, tunnels that whisk you to places and things, mini games, lots of unlocks.
3090777	3091598	It's a fun little world.
3091638	3092338	I was in there earlier.
3092719	3098904	So we're going to be in the Aurora space starting at 5 Pacific when Bobby's on, uh, 8 Eastern on the 29th.
3098964	3103347	We're the last event for PlayStation Summerfest where they're really excited to have us.
3103367	3105389	We're really excited to be a part of it.
3105629	3111354	I do want to point out it's not an official Sony home acknowledged thing, but we're hoping to make enough rabble that they'll notice.
3111954	3113815	So we're going to flip some chairs over in Aurora.
3113855	3114375	It'll be fun.
3115655	3116675	Just kidding.
3116715	3117315	Running man.
3117555	3120276	Listen, if you're going to flip chairs over, nobody's going to notice.
3120356	3121757	It's all about tables.
3122657	3124357	Sorry, it's all about flipping tables now.
3125457	3128358	So plan on joining us on the 29th.
3128618	3129939	Steam needs to be on Linux.
3131139	3133600	I thought they did have some type of Linux support or something.
3134660	3135940	If they do, I haven't found it.
3136100	3136780	I could be wrong.
3137040	3138481	Alright, we've got to get into gaming news.
3138641	3138981	We're like
3139673	3141053	We're talking a lot tonight, sorry.
3141113	3142414	Let's get into gaming news, Loki.
3164799	3167963	and you can check it out over at Amazon.
3168703	3169284	Let's see here.
3169785	3171967	I'm sure they've got a link on the front page to do that stuff.
3172028	3173309	Let's see what kind of games they've got here.
3174551	3175392	World of Tanks.
3177534	3178936	Can't hate a world full of tanks.
3179156	3180158	Shimogami Tensei.
3181738	3182339	That's pretty cool.
3184940	3188141	A lot of interesting looking MMOs.
3188161	3189302	8-bit MMO.
3190002	3192183	Kind of looks a little bit like Minecraft.
3192343	3194264	You can build anything they say in there.
3196925	3197685	RuneScape.
3198766	3199686	Let's see here.
3202176	3225093	A bunch of games, so definitely go check it out I wonder if they're going to have some more stuff included with that They're saying that some of the launch titles Battlestar Galactica, World of Tanks, Pandora's Saga, Stronghold Kingdoms, and Super Monday Night Combat So why does Amazon want to jump into this?
3227482	3229625	I guess Amazon likes to kind of get their hands in everything.
3229745	3230166	Exactly.
3230246	3237956	I think just to maybe get in on some of that, you know, in-game content.
3238136	3238477	You know...
3240791	3245672	Maybe to tie it in with the Kindle or something like that.
3245772	3249553	Maybe they can find a way to get some of these games to run on that platform.
3251413	3251693	I don't know.
3251713	3254774	I think just to get more hits on their site for whatever reason.
3255194	3257974	Kind of so people think of Amazon as the place to go for everything.
3260015	3261475	I guess it seems like a good tactic.
3261655	3263296	But do you think people will care?
3265256	3265456	Um...
3267085	3267405	I don't know.
3268086	3269988	I don't know if they are necessarily going to care.
3270008	3276456	I mean, it's kind of like... I don't think these places are the only places you can go to play these games.
3276656	3281181	So, I mean, if you're playing them already, it's not like you're going to go, okay, I'm going to all of a sudden go to Amazon.
3281662	3281762	Um...
3284623	3293231	It's definitely a way for maybe some of these companies that are putting out free-to-play stuff because the free-to-play market is quite crowded to get some exposure maybe.
3293972	3296794	So it's like, hey, I saw your game on Amazon.
3297115	3297855	I'm going to check it out.
3298796	3301879	Amazon hasn't been popular with every part of the gaming community though.
3301939	3310587	Some say that Amazon kind of rips them off because the whole like, you know, they have the right to price match whatever you do other places and kind of all this stuff.
3311367	3316091	and some developers had their game put up for free for too long on there.
3316131	3319993	I just remember hearing stories in the past about how not everybody's thrilled with Amazon.
3321494	3322295	You kind of need them.
3323756	3324697	The developers, that is.
3324857	3325778	Oh, yeah, that's true.
3327859	3329620	Well, we'll see what comes of that.
3329940	3331882	Although no Amazon console yet, right?
3332062	3334244	That's the last thing we need right now is another stinking console.
3334264	3338867	But if you want to check them out, it's amazon.com slash free the number two play.
3340902	3345551	Did I just see in chat that DJ Morpheus from Understation Live also just bought Borderlands?
3355941	3371338	Borderlands was a great game to begin with and that was a game that they knew how to do DLC and their DLC was pretty awesome so Game of the Year Edition and if you're too cheap for the Game of the Year Edition they have a regular version for $5 I just don't want to hunt around for skulls
3373086	3373787	And the little robot.
3387680	3388981	And Claptrap is awesome.
3390342	3391783	I watched Dan play through it on Xbox.
3392323	3395265	Well, this series I'm about to get into is awesome.
3395345	3396585	I remember this from the 80s.
3396666	3399027	It was one of my favorite role-playing series growing up.
3399387	3402949	I even liked the NES ports, even though some people hate them, but I remember it as a kid.
3403530	3404130	It's Ultima.
3404370	3405411	Remember the Ultima series?
3406011	3406772	Ultima Exodus.
3406972	3408553	Yeah, there was Ultima Online.
3408573	3411154	It was kind of the first MMO in some ways.
3412375	3414356	Ultima has a great history behind it.
3414516	3417118	And Ultima, it's coming back, y'all.
3418144	3420806	Oh, but not in the way you might think.
3421126	3427071	No, there's no Ultima X or any new Ultima Underworld or something being announced.
3427131	3432014	No, EA is going to be releasing Ultima Forever.
3432795	3434176	It's a cross-platform.
3435276	3436998	It'll take 13 years to come out.
3437178	3441301	I just want to point out Duke Nukem's last game was also named Duke Nukem Forever.
3441841	3453891	Hence my comment Ultima Forever is a cross-platform, free-to-play role-playing game It's being developed by BioWare Which, okay, we like BioWare, right?
3454191	3470924	But it's free-to-play, which, okay It's going to be published under what they call the Play For Free label What a descriptive label, a free ad That's so weird that they would put it under that label Battlefield Heroes is also that same division Okay, well Battlefield Heroes is pretty good
3471204	3472345	So... Or wait, no, I'm thinking 1942.
3472385	3476926	It's gonna... You thinking the shooter from Capcom from how many years ago?
3477006	3477427	No, no, no.
3477527	3478887	They had a Battlefield game.
3479527	3481208	I don't remember if it was Battlefield Heroes or not.
3481288	3483549	Whatever the one it was on... Maybe that was Heroes.
3484029	3485910	You will be controlling an avatar.
3485990	3487671	There's a cartoon aesthetic to it.
3488351	3494578	There's a character named Lady British now, and I'm assuming that's because Lord British is no longer with EA.
3494618	3495879	Lord British is Richard Garriott.
3496219	3499983	He's off doing his own thing, trying to travel to space and all that, and has the Facebook thing.
3500263	3507251	So now there's Lady British, which you've got to admit is kind of a nice little workaround for Lord British not being there anymore.
3507271	3507351	Yeah.
3508151	3534439	so yeah they are saying in the press release the first great western RPG has been lovingly restored in Ultima Forever you can sign up for the beta at ultimaforever.com I gotta admit I'm curious Bioware makes a lot of good stuff I'll play it the free to play thing makes me a little nervous but I do like Ultima so it's kind of one of those well free is a great trial price isn't it
3535659	3539401	It's better to pay nothing for a demo than to pay something for a demo.
3539881	3541362	I'm signing up for the beta.
3541722	3543383	I am so sorry, Bobby Blackwolf.
3543863	3547905	Richard Garriott, he's correcting me in chat, he didn't try to travel to space.
3548265	3549646	He did go to space.
3550586	3552888	I am so effing sorry for that oversight.
3552928	3559691	He went to space and he made some stupid paintings in space, which keep popping up in that stupid garage sale game he has.
3560171	3565154	GameGuru at live.vognetwork.com says, if you want to play a free-to-play Ultima, go to Good Old Games.
3565614	3568716	Ultima 4 and the two worlds of Ultima games are free over there.
3569797	3571278	I didn't know Ultima 4 was still free.
3571298	3572579	I thought that was just a weekend promotion.
3572619	3576321	But yeah, there are some good Ultima goodness over at Good Old Games.
3577122	3580504	When I was talking about Ultima Revival, Stan had brought up Ultima Dancing Game.
3580784	3582185	Because, you know, that's where everything's going these days.
3582765	3584806	Acidic Vampire follows that up with Ultima Rhythm.
3586267	3588168	No, I don't... I mean... Ultarhythm?
3588788	3594650	There was some good music in the NES ports of Ultima, but I think for a long time there really wasn't music in the Ultima games.
3595110	3600551	Then later on you would get like the AdLib soundtracks and so forth, but... I forgot about the AdLib.
3601572	3603252	Yeah, I had one of those.
3603852	3606093	Fuck Sound Blaster, I had an AdLib.
3607153	3608073	That thing was the shit.
3608574	3609134	Alright, anyhow...
3610134	3610554	That's it.
3610694	3611914	Ultima Forever.
3612194	3613455	Coming soon.
3613975	3614675	DarkSakura.
3614855	3615715	I just signed up for the beta.
3615995	3616335	Did ya?
3616515	3617155	I just did, yeah.
3617175	3618035	I kinda wanna sign up too.
3618956	3619276	We'll see.
3619356	3620236	Is it a Facebook game?
3621336	3623296	Uh, I don't see anything about that.
3623336	3624537	If it's a Facebook game, I'm out.
3624817	3628057	Well, if it's on Facebook, then I'm sure as fuck not gonna play it.
3628277	3632758	But, I mean, I won't find out until they put out a release, you know?
3633058	3633278	Yeah.
3633598	3637979	There was another Ultima free-to-play game, though, but this is cartoony.
3638799	3638919	Hmm.
3639799	3640219	Okay.
3641400	3641900	Whatever.
3642180	3645381	Okay, so how about a new model for PS3?
3645401	3645721	Ooh.
3647422	3648202	Another one?
3648803	3649363	Wait a minute.
3649403	3651764	Sony's only supposed to put out two models a cycle.
3651844	3655925	The 4000 series is rumored to be out at Gamescom next month.
3656986	3664488	And it is, there's a 4011C is the one that we've got a picture of here.
3664569	3667930	I mean, it still looks like a Foreman grill.
3668710	3678952	But at any rate, the pictures and information were coming from the British Agency of Telecommunications website.
3680232	3684293	So, I mean, it looks like it's ridged with a sliding panel.
3684933	3686933	But, I mean, like I said, it still looks like a foreman grill.
3688053	3691494	But it does fall in with the FCC documents that Sony filed earlier in the month.
3691894	3695575	This does have the new waffle attachment, though, so you can make waffles!
3696195	3696555	Waffles!
3698694	3701217	I wonder if I can cook chicken on it and then we'll have waffles.
3701577	3704039	Fact or crap though, because this whole thing is still a rumor, right?
3705040	3708823	Well, we've got a picture of it and they did file documents with the FCC.
3709003	3716990	Well, the fact that there's a new system SKU coming that's, you know, this FCC filing true, the fact that these pictures are of it or not, maybe.
3718394	3722376	I do not speak Portuguese, website.
3732856	3736337	Anyhow, do we need another PlayStation design?
3736357	3737677	I guess I could put it in Esperanto.
3737857	3743339	Well, there's a lot of speculation on what it was based on these pictures, which they're assuming are real.
3744199	3749460	It said it looked like it had top-loading disk drive, which that would be weird.
3750261	3754062	Going back to the PlayStation 1 with that, it's pretty cool.
3754202	3755142	We know how well that worked.
3756362	3758343	That'd be interesting, I gotta say.
3758363	3758443	Yeah.
3758922	3761890	Can I prop the door open to load region locked games?
3762351	3763955	I guess I don't have to worry about that on PS3.
3764216	3764778	Only one.
3765038	3765740	Only one, yeah.
3766783	3767485	Alright, moving on.
3768360	3775386	Um, so, I know this is gonna come as a shock, but there's another game being ripped off on the iPhone app store.
3775647	3776928	This time it's Torchlight.
3776988	3780150	Apparently there's a game called Armed Heroes Online.
3780451	3782032	Yes, I know, sounds generic enough.
3782553	3789519	It's on the Canadian iTunes store, and apparently they've ripped off nearly all the assets for Torchlight.
3790660	3791280	And, um...
3792601	3795924	And the makers of Torchlight are understandably pissed.
3815194	3816695	Yeah, they're definitely pissed off.
3817316	3818277	Now, here's the question.
3818437	3821700	Obviously, and I think it mentions this in the story, it's coming from another country.
3821760	3822440	It's not a U.S.
3822601	3823001	country.
3823722	3824742	Excuse me, it's not a U.S.
3824783	3826984	or Canadian company even that's doing it.
3827125	3828766	It's a company out of Beijing, right?
3828786	3830327	Yeah, EGLS Technology.
3830407	3831628	They're based out of Beijing.
3832249	3834091	And the game itself is free to play, of course.
3834171	3837834	They have in-app purchases, some upwards to almost $100.
3837874	3837934	And...
3842538	3844860	I mean, it's just... It's just bad.
3844901	3848124	The makers of Torchlight can't sue this company.
3848804	3848945	No.
3849145	3851868	And, like, if it were me, I would be so mad.
3852108	3852949	I would want to sue.
3853109	3855231	But you can't do that, really.
3855411	3857293	Like, that's not the way the world works, sadly.
3858054	3858314	So...
3859355	3866258	Now it comes back to, well, Apple should be able to recognize this stuff, but if I'm hearing it correctly, they didn't rip off the game.
3866658	3868659	They ripped off all the art assets.
3869179	3875942	So to a person who looks at 100 apps a day, you know, to give the approval or denial, maybe they didn't catch it.
3876423	3877323	So now what do you do?
3877463	3878684	How do you stop this shit?
3878824	3886307	Well, they should have a way that you can flag it or something and say, hey, you know, flagging for, you know...
3887968	3891330	It would be a good way to have it police itself, I guess.
3891350	3891631	I don't know.
3908482	3910284	I have to say that's actually kind of a good idea.
3910604	3916970	And people who just cry wolf too much would obviously be banned themselves from being able to do that in the future.
3917070	3920933	But yeah, I think they're going to need to go to some type of community policing system, unfortunately.
3921554	3925217	I mean, Apple's, I think, been pretty good when this stuff is called to their attention.
3925257	3931483	I mean, I've heard that they just, like this company, will probably never be able to put another thing up on the iTunes store.
3931783	3933745	But, oh well, they'll just apply under a new name.
3935077	3938278	Oh yeah, it's going to be really hard to get one of those $100 developer licenses.
3940199	3940439	Yep.
3940999	3949322	I'm sure that'll be difficult for them to acquire and change their name to, you know, I don't know, Not Company That Ripped Off Torchlight, Inc.
3951963	3959552	Well, this is a game people are excited about, and maybe it'll get ripped off and put out here sooner than the actual game itself will come out here.
3959953	3961534	Phantasy Star Online 2.
3962476	3966961	It is officially, as of this week, coming to North America and Europe.
3967061	3968743	It's happening early next week.
3969684	3982093	The number one thing we want to provide to players in PSO2 is an adventure that changes every time they log in.
3982473	3992340	Just as a great tabletop RPG experience revolves around imaginative and unexpected encounters, we want players to consistently be surprised as they explore dungeons and undertake quests.
3993020	4002924	Speaking of surprise, I don't know if you saw the article where apparently that game was hacked and someone had moved the NPCs around, and so they put them on top of buildings and stuff like that.
4003284	4003964	Already?
4004164	4004584	Already.
4004924	4006045	Good gosh.
4007545	4012527	It was funny, though, because it's like, hey, those quest-giving people are way up there.
4013147	4015088	That's unfortunate.
4015108	4015168	Wow.
4020487	4048937	I guess some other things with this it's out in Japan right now and it's free to download and it's free to sign up for because I know Shane he might call into the show later to talk about it and I've been begging him to do something for VOG on it but he's been playing it because I guess you can just sign up and play it and he's been begging me to play with him but I'm like no because I don't like the Japanese text will frustrate me to no end that I don't understand everything I have to know every little detail it's not a good idea for me to play this game
4049917	4053500	I will totally play the crap out of it
4070507	4073648	Well, here's another case of stupid parents.
4074908	4086210	There's a dad blaming Microsoft for his son spending money, which I don't see how Microsoft stood there with, you know, strings on his hand or mind control device.
4086770	4088351	The guy's name is Sam Guerra.
4089591	4090951	His son's name is Nick.
4091451	4094812	They live in Wolverhampton over in the UK.
4096332	4099353	And he said that the son spent...
4103579	4130852	1,150 pounds on Xbox Live which is a good two grand here roughly basically spending about a hundred pounds a day on games such as FIFA and Call of Duty but he wasn't realizing he was spending real money why aren't you watching your fucking bank account why do you have this credit card put in the system when you have a 12 year old playing it who does apparently wasn't paying attention in school and did not understand how money works
4132835	4135317	Especially since they do put the warnings up there.
4137598	4143081	They've got it on there exactly how much different items cost in terms of points.
4143821	4146503	Sometimes you can run up those charges behind your parents' back.
4146563	4150005	Like when I was 12, I was addicted to Prodigy chat rooms.
4150805	4151846	No, no, no, no, no.
4152226	4155368	I got in so much fucking trouble, though, the month that bill came in.
4156488	4160790	I'm not even giving it to them for saying that, oh, I didn't know it was real money.
4161170	4165593	That's bullshit, because yes, they're going to try to use that excuse because it's Microsoft Points.
4165613	4170615	The problem is, though, when you run out of Microsoft Points, you have to refill it, which means you have to go purchase Microsoft Points.
4170655	4172296	It says, purchase Microsoft Points.
4172736	4175897	It shows you, this is how much 1,000 Microsoft Points cost.
4175917	4180659	This is how much 8,000 Microsoft Points cost, and it has real money attached to it.
4180779	4182500	You're telling me that he didn't know that was real money?
4182740	4183681	He knew that was real money.
4184521	4185182	No one's that dumb.
4185462	4185903	I'm sorry.
4207560	4215428	All I gotta say is that kid looks like he has fear in his eyes and that father looks like he is angry as hell so I'm guessing that he was taken care of.
4216289	4223515	Microsoft, their response, and I'm quoting, "...there are multiple opportunities where consumers are asked to confirm their purchases.
4223955	4226497	The price is clearly displayed on the screen.
4226917	4238286	It should also be noted that Xbox Live accounts registered for children's use have online activity automatically defaulted to off, and that these can be enabled should a parent wish in the family settings section."
4239427	4254024	these settings include specifying the email address to which all purchase notifications are sent and using other features such as over-the-shoulder approval that allow the account holder to give permission for purchases by typing in a password so yeah, again, you're stupid
4254591	4259793	I love this comment in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com GameGuru says, it's always FIFA.
4260393	4262533	And Ahamkara says, FIFA again?
4262633	4265734	Why is that game always involved when it comes to money theft?
4266174	4271236	Hold on though, it's not really theft in this case, it's just massive irresponsibility.
4271256	4273197	They're just trying to pass the buck, that's all they're trying to do.
4273217	4277698	He's just not taking responsibility for his... The parent wants the money back and they're that desperate.
4278271	4279092	Well, no, what do you think?
4279132	4280672	Oh, we just want an apology.
4281533	4282273	No, you don't.
4282313	4286156	You want your damn money and you're, you know, you're trying to save faces what you're trying to do.
4286456	4286656	Yeah.
4287096	4295381	And sorry, it needs to burn a hole in your pocket so that you understand, you know, hit you where it hurts, have some responsibility.
4295582	4296582	I mean, let's put it this way.
4296622	4301125	I mean, this is a 12-year-old that's grown up in pretty much like a digital age.
4301471	4304414	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4323559	4326500	Even Josh knows what currency is at this point, probably.
4326881	4332463	He knows he... With the kid, I mean, the kid probably understood that he was spending money.
4332863	4338966	But as I've mentioned before, when the brain is developing, it's all about the immediate reward instead of the long-term consequence.
4339006	4345249	And this goes on in guys at least until between 25 and 27 on an average developmental range.
4345689	4347029	And for women between 24 and 25...
4348470	4349331	I don't know what you're talking about
4365965	4366966	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4385747	4399250	But, you know, it does why, you know, there's the going out and drinking and then driving and wrecking your car when you're not thinking about the consequence because your brain right then is not programmed to think of the long-term consequence.
4399311	4403191	It's programmed to think of... Watch out or someone's going to use that as an excuse in court.
4403772	4407973	Well... Officer, I was drinking and driving because my brain isn't fully developed yet.
4409793	4410293	You know what?
4411153	4413114	Dark Sakura on Orange Lounge Radio said...
4414562	4414722	No.
4416404	4419067	Clearly, there is a difference.
4419347	4431559	But going back to a kid, the kid's going to have poor impulse control without having a set reinforced expectation of punishment if they do something bad.
4432320	4434622	It's like, or they might not even care.
4434743	4437846	But the point is that it doesn't mean he's stupid that he doesn't know better.
4438266	4461114	it means he knew better and didn't care so that that's completely on the parent that you have to if you don't want any of that crap to happen you have to you know cut off the means of making it happen you have to not be an enabler not necessarily disable the action but not make it open to where they can actively do it that's part of your responsibility
4463525	4472793	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what money we can spend on little purchases in the game in the next couple weeks.
4473353	4474554	Loki, start here in the US.
4474694	4476015	What's coming out here?
4477697	4479718	There's really not anything coming out this week.
4479799	4482741	I want to say the only game coming out is Heroes of Ruin on 3DS.
4483662	4483942	That's it.
4485165	4485945	Sengoku Hime, Senko no Taika
4509312	4511013	and Akasuki no Haryu.
4511153	4514054	That's in regular and luxury limited edition.
4514675	4516375	I'm trying to figure out what this game is.
4516475	4522498	It's a strategy game and there aren't really any screenshots posted, but I see like dragons and tigers.
4523439	4524859	That's ancient mythology.
4525059	4528741	Yeah, so maybe it's like kind of a Nobunaga-ish game.
4528861	4529201	I don't know.
4530022	4532763	Yeah, but the Nobunaga games didn't have much to do with actual mythology.
4532783	4534784	Could it be Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?
4535164	4536425	No, I doubt it.
4537425	4560878	now what I find also interesting is that this is a peripheral coming out in Japan it's like a 500 gigabyte drive for your PlayStation 3 basically what it is it's like a recorder kit and this is kind of weird it's like this little thing that you can I guess record TV yeah I remember they had like a DVR thing that was supposed to be for the PS3 back there yeah so I mean they get that kind of stuff in Japan not here you can buy stuff like that at price
4563108	4569512	Yeah, but it's not official, technically, and it doesn't save your PlayStation drive unless you use some creative workarounds.
4570593	4579719	Anyhow, also pointing out on the PlayStation Vita, GQ Powerful Pro Yaku 2012 comes out from Konami this week.
4579759	4580219	Baseball.
4580519	4580699	Yep.
4581920	4583341	And lastly, let me check the 3DS here.
4586424	4589365	If it'll load for me, I love live radio.
4590465	4596487	Rune Factory 4 comes out this week, as well as Rayman Origins gets its Japanese release on the 3DS.
4596907	4602808	And something they call, this isn't a game, but some type of accessory, Candy Bar for Nintendo 3DS.
4602868	4603968	Candy Bar's a doll maker.
4604208	4606549	In black, blue, peach, and white.
4607273	4608414	Yeah, is that the doll maker?
4608474	4609415	Yeah, it is.
4609475	4610115	Yeah, I guess.
4610135	4615279	Is that some type of accessory kit for stickers and stuff for the 3DS?
4615800	4616740	Are there any other screen caps?
4616760	4617301	Nope, that's it.
4617861	4623105	Well, I know that there's a series of virtual doll makers that are called Candy Bar.
4624326	4624887	Well, there you go.
4624947	4625928	Japanese release dates.
4626648	4627629	Two things in the UK.
4627729	4632573	Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD on the 18th and Boulder Dash XL 3D on the 20th for the 3DS.
4632593	4632973	That's it.
4637355	4638717	I wonder where everybody's at right now.
4638757	4641181	I guess on vacation because we don't have a lot of games coming out.
4641221	4642844	The news was a little bit slow this week too.
4643425	4643685	Weird.
4644527	4646270	Although, there was a big story for you, Loki.
4647461	4647781	I know.
4648661	4649822	There was a few things, actually.
4650482	4654243	It wasn't mentioned on here, but they had another screenshot or trailer.
4654683	4657244	I think it was a screenshot for the Earth Defense Force game.
4657304	4665146	Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is the one that was 2017 over here on 360.
4665226	4666867	Remember, it's coming out on the Vita.
4667667	4672629	They showed a screenshot with the Jetpack Girl from number two, which is awesome.
4673709	4675710	Not to mention that that game also has four-player co-op.
4676170	4676750	Also awesome.
4677570	4681714	Um, but, D3, I love them.
4682294	4685737	They, uh, they announced, uh, Earth Defense Forces 4.
4686398	4690801	They have a teaser page on their website, and it's a new game from Sandlot.
4692803	4693524	I can't wait.
4693804	4695806	And, in fact, it's Earth Defense Forces.
4695946	4699609	I don't remember if the other games were Earth Defense Forces or if it's just Earth Defense Force, so...
4701235	4701795	I don't care.
4702836	4703957	I'm going to play that sucker.
4704377	4706319	And if I have to import it, I'm going to import it.
4707059	4709541	Because I love me some Earth Defense Force.
4711342	4712723	Oh, I'm sure it'll come out here too.
4713203	4716465	Oh yeah, it will, but not after quite a delay.
4716526	4718147	But I cannot wait.
4719127	4719908	It's going to be awesome.
4721189	4721710	I don't even care.
4721930	4725135	I mean, really, because it could be an absolutely terrible game.
4725155	4727097	Because 2017 was a terrible game.
4727978	4728619	But it was fun.
4728980	4730141	And that was the best part about it.
4730842	4734106	So, hopefully, we'll see something before Tokyo Game Show.
4734487	4736009	But if not, maybe at Tokyo Game Show.
4738519	4747084	Alright, well, there was a rumor going around at Comic-Con about a possible game made out of Tron Uprising.
4747985	4750566	There was a Tron Uprising panel at Comic-Con, apparently.
4750606	4752487	I didn't even know about that, but apparently they were doing one.
4752747	4754588	And I don't know if you've seen the anime yet, but it's pretty good.
4755309	4759671	Well, I keep calling it an anime because it has that style to it, but I guess technically it's not.
4759691	4762573	I mean, if you want to get technical with me, it's not, but whatever.
4763393	4764574	I missed a bunch of episodes of that.
4764614	4765995	Whatever you want to call it, Tron Uprising.
4766035	4767316	Anime is short for animation.
4767436	4767716	The end.
4767836	4770898	Yeah, so yes, and it is an animation, so deal.
4771359	4779485	But anyhow, they had a panel at Comic-Con, and I guess they were told at the panel, this would look great on a Wii.
4779965	4788152	Wait a minute, dot, dot, dot, and a lot of folks took that away saying, oh my gosh, they're teasing a Tron Uprising game on the Wii, which had me thinking, why?
4788692	4790133	The Wii is pretty much gone.
4790613	4793756	It'll be a Wii U. They're not putting anything on the Wii.
4794296	4803825	But, actually it came out and NSpace actually came out and said we were actually referencing the Tron Evolution Battle Grids game on the Wii.
4803985	4806347	They are not working on a new Tron title at this time.
4806387	4807368	Boo.
4807388	4809690	It's still early for the series.
4809810	4810751	Give it like a year.
4811952	4813313	Especially if there's going to be a third movie.
4813833	4814414	I don't know.
4832606	4834767	Wreck-It Ralph, which I'm about to get into here.
4835628	4841070	Wreck-It Ralph has been confirmed that he's going to be a playable character in Sonic Racing Transformed.
4841530	4851715	No word if it's exclusive to the Nintendo consoles, because we know there's that whole interesting Nintendo deal going on, but he will be a character for sure in the Nintendo 3DS version on November 16th.
4851975	4854777	This is that same racing game that has Danica Patrick and stuff, huh?
4855277	4857258	So you can be Wreck-It Ralph or Danica Patrick.
4857338	4860999	It makes sense since they've got a cameo from Dr. Eggman in there.
4861019	4862499	Robotnik.
4863479	4864299	But that's kind of fun.
4866140	4866700	There you go.
4867400	4869300	Those are some Disney gaming news.
4869841	4870241	Dang it.
4871041	4871621	What, you alright?
4871921	4877162	No, the shirt that I wanted to buy is sold out only in XXL and that's way too big for me.
4877222	4878062	Which shirt were you trying to buy?
4878082	4881063	It was the ladies Normandy crew shirt.
4882323	4883123	It was 11 bucks.
4883163	4886404	I do want to get the bumper sticker for my car that says my other ride is a Normandy.
4887614	4888795	I wouldn't mind the hoodie, but it's $50.
4890196	4894719	Alright, let's travel back in time to when gaming was simpler.
4896040	4898642	And there wasn't $50 tie-ins for video games.
4898722	4899743	Actually, there totally was.
4900163	4903966	I remember a catalog in Nintendo Power once that was selling Super Mario Bros.
4904026	4904466	underwear.
4905166	4907748	So, they've been profiting off video games for forever.
4908589	4913892	I don't know if this is a game that they profited off of, but I imagine they made a little bit of money off of this game.
4914233	4916094	DarkSakura, what is tonight's classic game of the week?
4916872	4920334	Classic Game of the Week is Shinobi for the arcade.
4921995	4923156	Yep, it is Shinobi.
4923196	4924457	It's about damn time I actually did that.
4924517	4929160	Instead of sequels like Shadow Dancer and Revenge of Shinobi and all that.
4929784	4935566	So basically, you are Joe Musashi, who has to rescue kidnapped students from a group of terrorists.
4937807	4948971	After the arcade version, it went out on the Master System and then was converted to the NES, PC Engine, and home computers, and now you can play it emulated on the Wii and Xbox 360.
4949511	4951372	So yeah, there were all kinds of stuff.
4952933	4980006	you are trying to stop a criminal organization called Z then they are kidnapping the ninja children so you have to go rescue them and then beat all the bosses can I just say this is my favorite most interesting thing in Shinobi and maybe you're going to get to this in a minute but it's the whole like Warhol Marilyn Monroe portrait that's randomly in the background and the miscolored Spiderman what is up with that
4980686	4983768	So your stages, you had five stages.
4983968	4987470	Your first one is Pursue the Terrorists, where you have to kill Ken-O.
4988170	4993754	And then two is you kill Black Turtle, Attack Chopper, and they drop a bunch of ninja on you.
4994754	5002619	And three is killing Mandara, that sounds kind of like a, I guess a good tranny name.
5003379	5005881	And then four is killing the Lobster.
5005901	5006401	Mandara.
5006901	5008182	Shantae, you stay.
5009143	5009343	Okay.
5010183	5015968	I'm not saying trannies are the same as drag queens because that's offensive and even that term is offensive to some so I apologize.
5016429	5017950	I'm just trying to be ignorant radio hosts.
5020993	5025437	Anyway, mission five is killing the masked ninja.
5026289	5027569	So it's side-scrolling.
5027589	5029210	You can throw your shuriken.
5029650	5031451	You can hit them with your sword.
5031891	5033571	And you also have ninja magic.
5034892	5042514	And your enemies can hide behind boxes or use blocks to shield your attacks.
5043134	5050336	And then if you complete each stage without using your ninja magic or without using any shuriken or bullets, you earn points bonuses.
5050936	5052917	And you have three minutes to finish each stage.
5054682	5060644	So for the Master System, it came out in Japan on June 19, 1988, and then came out in the U.S.
5060724	5061184	after that.
5062584	5065785	There were different bonus stages that were in the game.
5066046	5077249	We had, for home versions, we had the Amiga, we had the Atari ST, Commodore 64, the Armstead CPC, and ZX Spectrum.
5077969	5083051	And they were all developed by the Sales Curve and published by Virgin Mastertronic.
5084071	5088913	and in Europe and by Sega in North America except for the Armstrong and Spectrum versions because guess what?
5088933	5089453	We didn't have that.
5090214	5108802	The PC Engine version came out in Japan by ASMIC on December 8th, 1989 and then we had a NES version and like I said later on came out on Wii and Xbox 360 and then in the Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection it was included with that too.
5109723	5112068	So yeah, there's actually not anything on here.
5112088	5114053	Hold on, I'm going to find this real quick.
5114374	5114935	Play some music, Rob.
5124133	5127075	It's not really music so much as it is dude jumping up over and over.
5127095	5130118	Okay, the Spider-Man was actually in Revenge of Shinobi.
5131379	5134141	But there were guys that moved like Spider-Man and Shinobi.
5134161	5138044	Yeah, there's totally like an inverse Spider-Man looking guy right in the first stage.
5138484	5141887	And apparently Batman was in Revenge of Shinobi as well.
5142327	5143648	So, that's it.
5144268	5144729	Shinobi.
5145269	5146550	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5146730	5149092	Shinobi for the arcades by Sega.
5149432	5150813	Do you know what Shinobi means?
5152575	5152695	No.
5153331	5155232	I think it means stealth, but don't quote me.
5155732	5156032	All right.
5156672	5160093	We are going to take a break here, folks, but we will be right back.
5160133	5160714	Don't go anywhere.
5160754	5162354	We have rapid fire news coming up.
5162414	5164495	Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
5164535	5172578	Get those in the mailbag at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and more news all when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5178672	5192822	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this July the 15th of 2012 with episode number 465 of our show, live as we are every Sunday at vognetwork.com.
5192842	5196765	We're about to get into some rapid-fire news, but I wanted to ask Jamie.
5197125	5201068	I noticed one thing we haven't talked about on air yet is what we're eating behind the scenes.
5202149	5204811	Loki is chowing down on his Carl's Jr.
5204851	5207533	tonight, but DarkSakura and I were enjoying beer.
5208041	5209882	Yes, because beer is the food of the gods.
5210022	5221290	And I gotta say, it's pretty awesome because today, just on a whim, Alan and I went out for lunch, brunch, whatever, at this place we've gone to for dinner sometimes, a brewing company we have here in SAC.
5221570	5228274	And we went there for lunch, and what we learned today is that whenever you eat there on a Sunday, they give you free beer to go.
5228715	5236019	Like, the waitress came by and was like, okay, now you get free 22-ounce beer for each entree you order, so what beer did you want to take home with you?
5236039	5236440	And we're like...
5236940	5239021	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5265778	5267440	All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news.
5267760	5270102	Some games you can play while you enjoy your beer.
5270282	5274065	And I'm sure this first one will be a really hilarious game with enough beer.
5275387	5281212	So, you know, Ubisoft, purveyors of many dance games, some great, some good.
5283394	5285896	You may remember that they did Michael Jackson The Experience.
5286496	5287117	That was pretty cool.
5287857	5289319	Then Black Eyed Peas The Experience.
5291742	5293163	All right, I'll follow you there.
5293583	5296005	Now it's the hip-hop dance experience.
5296505	5307912	Yes, you can dance like other hip-hop artists, including they're going to have Rapper's Delight, and they even mentioned Flo Rida.
5308953	5317098	And I got to say, some of the video that they showed in there, they actually showed somebody doing a lot of floor work, which...
5319204	5320905	Good luck seeing that on a Kinect.
5321005	5326188	I don't think that's going to be able to work, but neat if they show you, like, all the breakdancing stuff.
5328049	5329610	And, you know, I don't know.
5330050	5335013	When you talk about, like, Rapper's Delight being in the game, I can't help but think about this.
5335493	5336494	That wasn't soon enough.
5338875	5339835	I said hip-hop.
5340096	5341977	I hit me to the hip, to the hip, hip-hop.
5341997	5342377	You don't stop.
5346010	5349112	I know that's quiet as hell and you can't hear that, but that's the rapping grandma from The Wedding Singer.
5349233	5349993	That was great.
5350534	5351134	Here's the thing.
5352415	5354557	I'm torn in a couple reasons.
5355717	5358680	One, I mean, I don't play a lot of dancing games.
5358820	5364865	But back in high school, I did take a hip-hop dance class and it was fun.
5364965	5369208	So it might be something I'm interested in.
5370370	5374874	Probably not something I'm going to be picking up, although if I do get a free copy, I'll be sure to try it out.
5375555	5376135	Not on camera.
5380390	5380890	That'd be neat.
5381250	5382951	Why not on camera?
5383371	5384032	Gee, I wonder why.
5384792	5389534	Black Eyed Peas, The Experience, though, should be pretty cheap by now, so I might try picking that up.
5390514	5398317	They also, of course, this game is being done by Anise, and they're behind Late Beat Agents, so a little bit of a pedigree there.
5400078	5404160	And, of course, the game itself looks very similar to Black Eyed Peas, The Experience.
5406841	5408041	Neat, I guess.
5409182	5409282	Um...
5410649	5414932	Alright, so another cool bit of info.
5415293	5420857	Nintendo released that they have sold over 5 million 3DS systems in the US to date.
5421677	5425861	And that's almost been a year's time since they've dropped the price on the 3DS.
5427822	5434024	Not bad, not bad, considering that they weren't doing too well as of last year, around this time.
5435124	5448328	And I'm sure that there was a big help thanks to Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time 3D, which sold over a million copies, Super Mario 3D Land, which sold 2.1 million copies, and Mario Kart 7, which sold 1.75 million copies.
5448928	5453849	And of course, they haven't really said anything about Kid Icarus Uprising, so it's too bad.
5454569	5456010	But I don't think it sold that many copies.
5457231	5475667	and last but not least Capcom is bringing Jojo's Bizarre Adventure to HD and coming to the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade game the wonderful System 3 I can't remember it was on that weird arcade hardware
5476907	5487773	But yeah, it's a 2D fighting game based on the anime series, manga series, and getting the typical Capcom HD up-res special filters treatment.
5488294	5498219	It's going to be available for 1600 Microsoft Points or $19.99, and it launches on August 21st on the PlayStation Network and 22nd on Xbox Live Arcade.
5502265	5503906	Alright, moving on.
5504246	5506828	A lot of people went squee about this this week.
5507729	5510430	Hello Kitty meets Sonic the Hedgehog.
5510631	5514933	Yes, there's this little doll that is Hello Kitty meeting Sonic the Hedgehog.
5514973	5516895	And I know this doesn't make good radio, but it's cute.
5519056	5519837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5538200	5544942	Hello Kitty Jumbo Plushie is available or will be available at Sega Amusement Parks in Japan starting in late July.
5545082	5550224	It is commemorating the reopening of Sega's Tokyo Joyopolis on June 14th.
5551865	5555106	I guess the Hello Kitty Chun-Li plush will have to do for now.
5555166	5556526	That's available at Comic-Con for $40.
5556626	5559587	I'm pretty sure it's already gone if you want that.
5560207	5562768	Not a fan of Hello Kitty cross Chun-Li?
5563408	5563768	Not a fan?
5564028	5564609	I don't like Chun-Li.
5565789	5568191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5593846	5608456	but he couldn't say much more than that and of course a lot of people are reading into that that oh well if you don't need to bug Capcom anymore it's because it's happening but I mean you know this has been speculated for a while it would make a lot of sense I'm sure it's a thing yeah
5609456	5614799	The only bummer is it's going to come out the same year that new consoles start coming out, and I bet this is probably for the old consoles.
5614879	5617341	So, I mean, hopefully people don't miss this.
5618261	5621443	But it's something that they could release spring, fall.
5621483	5627626	I mean, I don't even think it's necessarily a bad thing that's coming out for new consoles, and we don't even know if new consoles are coming out this next year.
5627686	5633409	I mean, it's speculated that's probably the earliest at the launch, but they could still hold off another year.
5633890	5634570	True, very true.
5634590	5635531	Um...
5636491	5636791	DarkSakura
5659679	5670345	Well, for fans of Street Fighter, there is going to be a PS3 Street Fighter anniversary collection, which actually I think I've brought up before.
5670765	5677229	Because, I mean, this has been, the pictures have been out for a little while, but there's more stuff that's been slated for it.
5678249	5680851	What's coming out with this is that it looks like it's going to have...
5682652	5706964	The PS1 versions of Street Fighter Alpha The Street Fighter Alpha 3 for PSP And then DLC for Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online And 175 PSN avatars Really all I care about is the Ryu statue All I care about That and I wouldn't buy it on PS3 I'd get it on Xbox 360 where I can use a decent controller
5708624	5733829	and then Zone of the Enders there's going to be the HD collection and it's very cel-shaded and J-poppy it looks pretty good from what I saw but it's sorry my nose was itching but basically it's going to be there's a why am I so tongue-tied today?
5735910	5736410	you drank beer?
5736883	5738605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5755979	5756719	It's still going.
5756940	5763022	We've got, as of today, Max Payne 3 for $30, which is 50% off.
5763722	5772286	Anno 2070, Warhammer 40k, Payday the Heist, Tribes Ascend Starter Pack, From Dust, The Binding of Isaac for $1.24.
5772326	5774587	That's 99 pence over in the UK.
5777208	5781052	Indie Bundle 2 for $10 and Sonic Generations for $10.19.
5782673	5783974	Which, I want Sonic Generations.
5784034	5785115	I'm thinking about getting that instead.
5785936	5787857	So, that's it.
5790492	5795733	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com.
5796173	5797873	Use the passphrase, bowling.
5798534	5803415	All right, this is the part of the show where we would usually ask the fugal question of the week, except there was a little bit of Rob fail this week.
5803775	5815537	I didn't ask anything, so I apologize for that, but I will go ahead and plug our Facebook and Google Plus communities, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and of course you can find us on Google Plus by searching for Orange Lounge Radio and answer whatever question we post next week.
5815977	5820178	I was working on other VOG stuff literally all afternoon when I usually do the question.
5820538	5823280	There's more songs in the network rotation and all that stuff now.
5823320	5826243	It was one thing I was working on today, getting some more of that stuff coded and all that.
5826683	5827964	So, yep.
5828185	5829946	Otherwise, though, sadly, no question this week.
5829986	5833369	But we will have the mailbag coming up after a few more news stories.
5833950	5834250	Loki.
5836111	5836472	All right.
5837553	5842217	So let's talk a little bit about fun stuff, including...
5844520	5846520	DRM that just sucks.
5847000	5850841	And Ubisoft, you may remember, has the wonderful Uplay.
5852242	5853882	Or maybe in this case you don't play.
5855182	5856782	Because their server is down.
5857543	5863524	Perfect example of why this always connected internet DRM sucks.
5864304	5869805	And Ubisoft's Uplay client, or you're not playing because it's offline right now,
5870665	5894882	Uh, it's been down for a bit, and of course people are pitching a fit because, hey, I can't play my Assassin's Creed game, or hey, I can't, you know, log in at all, and this just sucks, but just kind of wanted to, uh, punctuate the fact that, you know, this is not a good method of DRM.
5895142	5897604	In other words, here we go again!
5900974	5901335	I don't know.
5901555	5903198	I don't understand why they...
5907707	5914834	Let me just quote a few complaints in the Cannot Log Into Uplay forum on Ubisoft.
5915454	5925023	Ubisoft, if you're going to be twats and treat your paying customers like criminals who get to avoid your crap by pirating them to begin with, here's a tip.
5925223	5930648	If you're going to have always on DRM, make sure your DRM is always fucking on.
5933542	5937264	and, you know, of course, let's see here.
5938145	5939646	How long until the class action lawsuit?
5941447	5946069	Probably not going to happen, but... Are you kidding, Loki?
5946109	5947110	This is America.
5947210	5948211	Of course it's going to happen.
5948431	5960918	And before you all blah, blah, blah to me about the user and agreement and all that stuff you have to click OK to, please, like that, stop the guy who was bitching about Microsoft and, you know, the kid buying points.
5962429	5962689	True.
5962709	5964110	Like that's going to stop anyone.
5964610	5969793	Apparently, according to their forum manager, it's back up now.
5970133	5974535	But, I mean, I don't know.
5974815	5977957	It's just not very...
5980620	5981522	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5994396	6000199	Bobby in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I am still sad SimCity has Always On DRM.
6000579	6002320	They did confirm that recently again.
6002500	6007002	They hope to learn from others' mistakes with their SimCity Always On DRM.
6007042	6010823	Now, granted, that's not Ubisoft, but still, it's one reason I probably won't buy it.
6011023	6019427	The fact that they say that they want to learn from others' mistakes and they have Always On DRM proves that they haven't learned from other people's mistakes.
6022423	6023043	Plain and simple.
6023183	6025544	I mean, Diablo had problems.
6025824	6027905	Yep, and Diablos continue to have problems.
6027985	6030986	We went into this a little bit on Horde House, plug, plug, this week.
6031947	6041431	My other show that's more about the Blizzard stuff, especially World of Warcraft, is that we were talking about how Diablo 3's endgame, even Blizzard has had to come out and say it's not quite what they anticipated.
6041591	6045232	And Diablo 3, it's not a flop, but from a...
6047606	6055190	Fanboy rabidness standpoint, like how loyal the fanbase is to the game, it's losing clout significantly.
6055610	6056911	Significantly over Diablo 2.
6057591	6060512	I know that sounds like a really weird ranking, but let me put it this way.
6060913	6067696	If Diablo 4 were announced tomorrow, people wouldn't be as excited as they would have been if the game went a little differently.
6068516	6069197	That's my point.
6071238	6073679	So... Anyway...
6074298	6080601	Well, also something to consider when people are pitching you the next expansion to StarCraft 2 or something like that.
6082462	6083902	Which is still supposed to come out in 2013.
6085612	6086453	Who gives a shit?
6087574	6090256	Honestly, I mean... Rabid StarCraft players of which there are still a few.
6090276	6091837	No, I understand that, but here's my thing.
6092518	6093298	Here's what I don't understand.
6093358	6097221	Okay, it's an expansion for what I assume is the single-player campaign, right?
6097802	6099343	Or co-op campaign or whatever.
6099844	6104467	If you're playing multiplayer just to play, like, deathmatches and stuff like that, who gives a shit about an expansion?
6104647	6106389	Or is it supposed to add new units and stuff?
6106549	6106949	You got it.
6107189	6110372	Add new units and maps and other things that will be unique.
6110772	6114856	And I believe the Blizzard Dota will be a part of the new expansion.
6116117	6117718	Which is a big deal for some people.
6117758	6119719	Whoopity shit.
6120760	6121060	All right.
6121661	6122502	Now, all right.
6122542	6129667	If my Hello Kitty cross sonic thing would not make DarkSakura squee, I know this next story will make DarkSakura squee.
6129707	6131088	So pay attention, DarkSakura.
6131589	6142297	Because announced during the Marvel panel at this year's San Diego Comic-Con, High Moon Studios developing and Activision Publishing a Deadpool game.
6142637	6144158	Yes, and I've seen quite a bit of this.
6144839	6145440	Quite pleased.
6145840	6149583	And it's going to be launching on who knows what in 2013.
6149683	6155568	We don't know if it's like a next gen thing or if it's, you know, for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the usual suspects.
6155588	6157870	Did they say if they got Nolan North to do the voice again?
6158771	6161634	Nolan North will be reprising his role as the assassin.
6162194	6163755	That was the one thing that I didn't see.
6163856	6166518	And he's like seriously the best voice actor for Deadpool.
6167910	6168691	Deadpool Deadpool
6194975	6198478	Ubisoft already put out an Avengers game this year and it sucks.
6199058	6199818	So I'm just saying.
6199878	6200379	That's too bad.
6200879	6201480	It is too bad.
6202240	6203641	How do you fuck up the Avengers game?
6204261	6205422	Apparently give it to Ubisoft.
6206063	6210626	Why do you love Deadpool so much, DarkSakura, for those that may not know?
6210666	6212207	Because he's freaking insane.
6212787	6215129	And he's like one of the few good things that Liefeld did.
6215909	6218491	Because Liefeld just cannot draw people at all.
6219352	6220893	But Deadpool is just sort of like...
6222358	6251709	yeah he goes around killing people but he makes jokes and he's really funny and he's fucked up in the head and like my old wallpaper for a long time was him killing a horde of clowns that were attacking him and it was the best thing ever and he's super funny in everything except there's way too many Deadpool comics out right now so the market was way oversaturated and it also gives Liefeld an excuse to draw again and I do not like Liefeld's drawing and there's the tendency to defect the fourth wall
6252392	6281760	yes that too because well the only other I think like there's a couple of other Marvel characters that do that one of them being She-Hulk who her law firm uses old issues of Marvel comics as legal research so it's pretty funny but yeah she and Deadpool who were two of my favorite characters break the fourth wall all the time and that and Deadpool talks to his inner voices and sometimes they tell him he has to pee and other stuff all right Darsara what do you got for us next in news
6283223	6284564	In news?
6285265	6286746	It's not mail time?
6287147	6288948	No, not yet.
6289849	6297316	Well, how about Valve having a counter for EA's statement about cheapening intellectual property?
6298477	6307523	and basically EA's dude said that Steam's huge sales will cheapen intellectual property and that they're not going to copy that.
6307603	6314807	They said the game makers work hard to make the intellectual property and we're not going to be Target.
6314827	6315908	We're trying to be Nordstrom.
6317749	6326054	Did you see that there was a great side-by-side picture of all these games on Origin and then what they cost on Steam right now and it was really something else.
6326374	6326735	But you know...
6327722	6331925	In the digital world, first off, Target is really not a bad store.
6331945	6337148	I proudly shop at Target, despite all the anti-gay stuff you're hearing on the internet.
6337168	6339710	Target gets deals, though, with actual big-name designers.
6339890	6340911	They worked with Anna Sui.
6342071	6342872	Isaac Miserati.
6343152	6343392	Yeah.
6343972	6347815	So they get good deals out there, and they bring designer goods to the average market.
6347935	6359404	Now, if you had said Nordstrom and the 99 Cent Clearance Center, or a store I prefer not to go to in some neighborhoods, maybe I would understand that a little more, but Target's not exactly a bad place.
6359444	6360425	Well, here's the other thing, too.
6361065	6367450	They do realize that no one's holding a gun to these developers' heads about marking their games down.
6367490	6372834	It's something that these developers chose to do, or these publishers chose to do.
6372994	6374475	Well, but isn't one of them EA?
6374535	6376797	Because Mass Effect 2 and some of the older stuff...
6376937	6380186	Well, they're the ones that chose to do that to mark it down, so...
6383161	6386643	If you don't want cheap in your product, then why include yourself in the sale?
6386903	6391325	I mean, it's not Steam going, okay, we're going to, hey, developer, you know what?
6391365	6395607	We're just going to go ahead and mark your title down so you're just going to be getting less money for each copy sold.
6396067	6397068	I mean, they're not doing that.
6397188	6401089	They're coordinating with these people that want to be part of these sales.
6401369	6406512	So EA is a bit hypocritical there that they're like, oh, these guys shock.
6406652	6408833	Let's mark our own titles so we can get some more sales.
6409133	6411394	Well, how about I finish the article?
6412054	6419678	Because they interviewed the business development chief, Jason Holtman.
6420699	6425981	And he was basically saying they're making money for all of their partners.
6426421	6428222	The discounts serve different functions.
6428963	6431284	And to quote on here, highlighting serves a lot of functions.
6431704	6447005	the qualities of the games serve a lot of functions everything we've seen PC games and IP and all those franchises are more valuable today than they were four or five years ago and he goes on to say later on that
6449267	6449767	Here's a quote here.
6449807	6450728	We do it with our own games.
6450768	6456089	If we thought having a 75% sale on Portal 2 would cheapen Portal 2, we wouldn't do it.
6456490	6461091	We know that there are all kinds of ways customers consume things, get value, come back, build franchises.
6461611	6463732	We think lots of these things strengthen it.
6464352	6469694	And they said later on that if we were somehow on a cycle...
6471792	6479655	Yeah, they're saying that based on their 40 million users, that they haven't run into the people waiting for stuff to go on sale.
6480795	6488238	They said that if they were seeing people just waiting for stuff to go on sale, they definitely wouldn't do it with their own titles.
6488738	6492159	But it's their own titles that they put out there first for those super sales.
6492860	6495381	Because people will still order them.
6495901	6497661	They'll still wait for that release date.
6497681	6501783	They'll still want it day one because they're fans of it and they like the service.
6502303	6506045	And they know that later on there's going to be another good deal with it.
6506365	6508666	Remember when they gave Portal away for free?
6508706	6508986	Yes.
6510206	6511387	They gave it away for free.
6511987	6514988	And they conveniently did that not long before Portal 2 came out.
6515833	6545159	and it was also right in line with the Mac version of Steam so and this one thing that I really liked is that they recognize that there's a user base on Mac that wants to play the games so they're making them available and now we've got them working on Linux so they know people aren't just PC gamers hello artists like to play games too that Borderlands Game of the Year edition for $7.50 it's mighty convenient that Borderlands 2 is coming out in September yeah a little bit a little bit
6546055	6546856	Which you should pick it up.
6547596	6548217	Pick up both of them.
6548637	6549758	Borderlands, Game of the Year.
6551280	6552361	Three hours left, I think.
6552841	6556144	Or it was very few hours left when I purchased it before the show.
6558005	6559066	It might already be done.
6560608	6562589	All right, a few more stories for you guys and then the mail back.
6562670	6563090	Oh, I'm sorry.
6563470	6567854	Well, the other thing, too, is that Origin is still sitting at number two with 11 million registered users.
6568575	6570977	And Steam has, like I said, 40 million registered users.
6571463	6573885	EA is kind of forcing people to register too.
6574045	6587298	Now, to be fair, Valve did that too in the beginning and people didn't like it, but I'm just saying how much of that 11 million were people that wanted to sign up for the service or how many are Battlefield 3 and Mass Effect 3 players that had no choice?
6587438	6590821	I'll tell you what, I still launch Mass Effect 3 through Steam because I can do screencaps.
6591341	6592221	Thank you for watching!
6607745	6608426	A little work around.
6608806	6609206	A little bit.
6610067	6611949	A few more stories for you guys and then the mailbag.
6612069	6615712	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com to send us an email for a future week.
6615792	6616552	But first, Loki.
6617053	6625280	So not to be outdone by the summer of arcade, the PlayStation Network has decided to go ahead and launch PlayStation Network Play.
6625820	6629781	which is kind of like Summer of Arcade during the month of August.
6630141	6636784	They're going to release a bunch of different games that are going to be kind of part of this including, and actually I guess it's part of July too.
6636824	6639144	July 24th to August 27th is when it's going to run.
6640005	6644846	There's going to be four games launched on the PlayStation Network.
6644926	6652489	Papo and Yo, Sound Shapes, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, and The Expendables 2 video game.
6653489	6653589	Um,
6655313	6660274	And I guess if you buy any combination of those games, you actually get some money back.
6661194	6662554	The more you buy, the more you get back.
6662594	6663834	Two games gets you $3.
6664795	6666055	If you buy all four games, you get $10.
6666195	6675336	And if you're a PlayStation Plus member, you even get 20% on top of all that.
6675537	6676177	So that's kind of cool.
6679877	6680377	Very cool.
6681898	6683318	Let's move on to one more story.
6684406	6685467	about Richard Garriott.
6686047	6687548	Here he is again in our show.
6690349	6695192	Apparently, he has raised $7 million for a new iOS game.
6695252	6697093	It's a social RPG.
6698054	6703436	Right now, I guess, you know, is obviously the Portalarium, which, you know, Loki's talked about at length on the show previously.
6703456	6704797	I fucking hate that game.
6705297	6707639	You hate it because of what happened with Ready Player One.
6707659	6709220	I hate it because it's a piece of junk.
6709520	6711401	It is just absolute crap.
6711881	6720368	I mean, if you're going to play absolute crap, yeah, it's kind of cool to collect old-ass nostalgia stuff, but it's a piece of shit game.
6721529	6726833	Well, this new RPG that he's going to be funding here is called New Britannia.
6727373	6728093	Portalarium
6758240	6764625	which is Richard Garriott's new gaming venture is also supposed to be one of the launch companies in Zynga's partner program.
6764645	6767727	Well, that makes me double excited about this news.
6770569	6771090	Yeah.
6772471	6774412	Let me just save everybody a lot of time.
6775033	6776594	That game sucked.
6778336	6779837	Garage sale game.
6779857	6782559	Okay.
6783200	6785041	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
6785942	6793007	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com We pull out a few of our favorite emails and read them right here on the show.
6794388	6795829	Sounded vaguely Kermit-like, Rob.
6797530	6798791	Hi-ho, Kermit the E-Frog here.
6800852	6802934	Well, at any rate... Read the goddamn emails.
6804537	6809481	I suppose if I say Kaden, that's a little bit too obvious, isn't it?
6809501	6810382	Garrus I don't even know
6834131	6854097	that just doesn't exist in reality with me the minute he said something about that to his wife the wife would just literally point and laugh at him I really wouldn't be turned on by that anyway not gonna lie, I would a little bit I love my husband exactly how he is and I think that dressing up for your significant other is stupid and a waste of money
6855717	6856737	Now, I'd dress up for cosplay.
6856757	6857578	Not necessarily.
6857678	6860559	If we cosplayed together, that would be different, and then I'd have to pounce on them.
6860599	6862740	I don't think there's anything wrong with dressing up.
6863320	6871743	Now, if my significant other would pay for a stripper that was dressed up like somebody, then... I don't know.
6872184	6872684	I still don't know.
6873304	6873944	A hot redhead.
6874124	6874425	I don't know.
6874445	6875165	Pick a hot redhead.
6878006	6878306	Anyone.
6879086	6879407	I don't know.
6879967	6880447	Dumb Shep!
6882488	6883048	Sure, why not?
6885106	6887187	Okay, so moving on.
6889149	6892651	This is from Clover and Nikon.
6893711	6894412	Hi, OLR.
6894452	6898735	I just wanted to share a picture of what the children watched one day at vacation care.
6899515	6902497	It was an episode of the 80s Super Mario Brothers cartoon.
6902857	6906520	Anyway, keep up the great show, and I will do my best to visit VOG with more CG art.
6907280	6909001	And let me take a look at this picture.
6910722	6913404	Of course, it comes up massive on my teeny little screen, so I can't.
6913720	6916862	Fire Suit Flipping somebody off with the fire finger It's something all kids should watch
6932293	6935975	It still gets rerunned on some little independent networks.
6936035	6937136	Nothing like CBS or whatever.
6937156	6941818	But if your town has a ton of networks, I think for a while the PAX Network, remember that?
6941838	6942899	I don't think they're called that anymore.
6942919	6944179	I think they're ION or something.
6944259	6945320	It's mostly God shows.
6945840	6950843	But they would also have randomly Mama's Family reruns, which was a great show.
6950903	6951223	Shut up.
6951843	6955245	Or Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers Super Show for a long time.
6956166	6956646	So anyhow.
6957717	6959898	Okay, so, moving forward.
6962079	6968242	Hey, OLR, it's been a while since I've written, but I wanted to extend a long overdue congratulations on the creation of the VOG Network.
6968883	6976667	As a small business owner myself, I understand what a huge undertaking this must have been for you, and in such a small amount of time, it's truly a remarkable accomplishment.
6977207	6981009	Also, I missed my opportunity to congratulate you on your landmark 10-year achievement.
6981429	6985371	Thank you for all of the laughs and the pure entertainment that you have provided me over the years.
6985471	6986112	I've been listening since 2005.
6987383	6989085	Well, you know what they say, better late than never.
7007305	7012187	and is complimented by a truly unique cast of characters in Visionary World.
7012547	7013988	Think Blade Runner meets Terminator.
7014608	7021371	It's got me thinking of how much there must be hundreds of games every year that come out and are met with little to no publicity or claim that they deserve.
7022091	7022591	I liked Fractal.
7022611	7023872	That didn't seem to get a lot of buzz.
7050666	7078893	I'm gonna say the Cold Sept games like Cold Sept Saga on the 360 and I think I've referenced this on the show before but it's kind of like Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly I'm not sure why these games aren't like a bigger deal but I guess maybe it's kind of a niche thing but yeah I really like those games and they don't seem like I didn't even know the 360 one was coming out but like I saw like a random ass thing somewhere and I was like they're making one but that was several years ago that it came out I'm sure it's near impossible to find a copy of it now
7080594	7082895	In a way, DDR, kinda.
7083736	7084516	Incredible Crisis.
7085537	7087398	Remember how we were all hooked on Incredible Crisis?
7087518	7088538	Oh yeah, that's old school.
7088578	7089479	That's really old school.
7089499	7090839	I'm trying to think of newer stuff.
7094534	7119993	Imagine Party Babies, Rob, I found you a copy last night I loved Lost Odyssey, and a lot of people wrote that one off, and I don't know why I didn't actually realize that WTF came out Oh yeah, that was a long time ago I know, but I guess I wasn't thinking about it, because I was like, oh it's at E3, no one's going to pay for this You were asleep Yeah, I was asleep, but I found a copy used Easy, Earth Defense Force
7121208	7122449	You and your bugs, of course.
7122469	7123630	It is an awesome game.
7123890	7126912	I mean, seriously, 2017 is a lot better than Insect Garmageddon.
7127212	7132075	Insect Garmageddon is a more polished game, but it didn't sell what they had hoped.
7132195	7135658	And because of that, the publisher didn't really support it.
7136018	7139140	And that's kind of disappointing because the levels are really limited in it.
7139260	7140741	But still a great game.
7141481	7143042	Oh, and of course, President Cat.
7144383	7145184	Yes, President Cat.
7147049	7157893	Going to our chat room at chat.vognetwork.com or live.vognetwork.com ImmortalKing says, I would have said Psychonauts, but that game applies.
7158673	7162555	AcidicVampire says, Lost Odyssey is the real Final Fantasy XIII.
7162675	7163515	Yeah, I went there.
7164555	7169177	That's because Final Fantasy XIII is really Final Fantasy XIV, and then XIV doesn't exist.
7172150	7174372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7193551	7217499	and so it was basically this like almost like a SEAL team or something like that coming in to solve this invasion of Tokyo from these robots there's another game that was similar that kind of flew under the radar I don't know if it was really good was Inversion which had like this gravity shifting mechanic to it and stuff oh yeah some people I knew were going crazy about that one
7219629	7221030	Well, to finish the email?
7221090	7221290	Sure.
7222291	7228714	On a closing note, I'd like to give a shameless plug to a video game power-up themed art show called This Will Increase Your Ex.
7230295	7233957	It's at Gallery 27 in Chicago and opening on Saturday, August 4th.
7234777	7238120	If any of your listeners live in the city, I encourage you all to come and check it out.
7238540	7243364	I've attached some vintage style posters of mine that will be in the show along with a few t-shirts we'll be selling.
7243965	7248628	And I gave the link to the Tumblr to Ranma to put on our Tumblr and to follow.
7249089	7257075	But it's gallery27chicago.tumblr.com And looking at the stuff, it's very, very good work.
7257295	7262620	I know we got some Chicago peeps that listen to the show because I met some at ASEN.
7262660	7264121	So check it out.
7264454	7270018	Yeah, these are pretty, your design skills are pretty fantastic.
7270158	7274281	So I wish I could just, you know, post these in chat, but unfortunately I can't.
7275202	7277363	So yeah, check out Gallery 27's Tumblr.
7278865	7281286	I'm actually going to follow them on my primary Tumblr.
7282667	7282927	Done.
7282948	7284088	That's your free emails?
7284429	7284589	No.
7284829	7284909	Oh.
7286127	7286788	Jeez, Rob.
7288009	7288670	Hey, OLR.
7288730	7289451	I said Don.
7289711	7290752	No, with that one.
7292013	7292734	Hey, OLR.
7292774	7294016	I'm a huge fan of your show.
7294656	7300382	Only have been listening for the past three months, but I can tell you you have a devoted listener now as well as a new VOG member.
7300563	7300843	Woot.
7301484	7301984	Sucker.
7303726	7304507	You're fired, Rob.
7305259	7307280	My question is directed to you, Rob.
7307580	7310082	There should be a comma, by the way, after you, just saying.
7310802	7311263	You're new.
7311543	7314124	If you're writing us, you've got to get the grammar treatment.
7315945	7318027	Jamie does all this to the new listeners.
7318067	7319327	Your grammar will be hazed.
7319668	7320148	Yes, it will.
7321228	7324210	You know that last email that we got had stupendously wonderful grammar?
7325311	7326652	Well, an A-plus for that emailer.
7326832	7328433	Yeah, they win an invisible gold star.
7330145	7332347	Soon we will have loot on VOG Network.
7332367	7334690	We can actually do a gold star email award.
7335371	7336553	Awarded on VOG Network.
7336753	7339617	I will reward you for proper grammar and good spelling.
7340097	7341779	I want to hear my question.
7343361	7346265	I hear that you have started playing Final Fantasy XI again.
7348038	7354522	This is my very first MMO I ever tried and I fell completely in love with this game as already being an FF nut before.
7355523	7366210	As life went on and started realizing that this game is such a time sink, I left the game and started playing WoW, something a little less hardcore and time consuming than Final Fantasy XI is.
7366230	7367751	You think that's less time consuming?
7367911	7368171	Okay.
7369913	7372094	Yes, because you don't have the grind.
7372134	7377818	I mean, you can spend all fucking day and night playing WoW, but you actually will accomplish something.
7378739	7378979	True.
7379859	7385163	You have me interested in Final Fantasy XI once again with some of the changes you have said they have made.
7385604	7389046	My question is, is there still a good amount of people playing?
7390227	7391588	Okay, I'm gonna fix your grammar.
7391969	7394491	Are there still a good amount of people playing?
7396605	7398628	Is there a lot of downtime LFG or no?
7399169	7400751	Syllable and still need groups?
7401232	7405198	As a former Dark Knight, what would you suggest my starting job be?
7405578	7406620	Big fan of DPS.
7406920	7407762	Keep up the good work, gang.
7407782	7408162	Love you guys.
7408182	7408483	Travis.
7409711	7411992	Um, okay, trying to get some of those questions out of the way.
7412152	7414772	Is it hard to find a group for leveling?
7415072	7417593	No, not at all, because everything's done in alliances now.
7417893	7426014	It's like when you first start the game, you're gonna just head over to Gusken Mines, which I know is a foreign thing, because it's like, no, no, I go to the Dunes, and then I go to Quefam Island.
7426074	7426255	Nope.
7426855	7432816	Now you go to Gusken Mines, the place of the scary siren, and you do the field manual for skeletons, and you can...
7433536	7435239	Group that all the way to level 40.
7436000	7437622	And then after that, you go to Crawler's Nest.
7437642	7442068	But if you get to level 40 in a couple days, you're going to be so freaking happy as it is.
7442208	7443470	You'll kind of figure the rest out.
7444352	7445894	Are there still a lot of people playing the game?
7446014	7447596	Depends on your opinion of a lot of people.
7449839	7452222	They merged some of the servers some time ago.
7452262	7455745	You remember how we used to talk about the fairy server when we were talking?
7455865	7457987	Remember the old days of OLR and the fairy server?
7458247	7459589	There is no more fairy server.
7459609	7465354	It was merged with the Sylph server, which is ironically enough the server that I'm on now.
7465655	7466896	Which is another type of fairy.
7467336	7468497	Yes, so it's appropriate.
7468517	7469818	That's still the fairy server.
7469858	7471579	Yes, it's just now a different name.
7471999	7477943	So I did a see all slash see all the other day, and there were 1,080 people online.
7478143	7480064	So I'd still call that a fair amount of people.
7480704	7483986	Now, whereas it's easy to find leveling groups...
7484987	7490431	People are still having a hard time finding groups for missions and things like that and you gotta find your way into a link shell.
7491172	7505803	There's still the Juno shouts and all that stuff and you might be able to find something but you can expect that some of that will still be a little bit of a wait and that's kind of the problems I'm starting to have with it is that whereas the leveling thing is awesome, the rest of it's less awesome.
7506784	7508846	I probably am not going to renew past this month.
7508886	7513271	Shane told me he's not renewing past the month because of other stuff, and I'm like, I don't even want to play by myself.
7513711	7518897	And I don't have a link shell on there or anything, so I'm like, I'll wait and get Guild Wars 2 when it comes out.
7519618	7520959	But I like you...
7522400	7529004	and Final Fantasy XI wasn't my first MMO, but it was the first one I played a lot of.
7529024	7531786	I played a decent amount of it for a little while.
7532727	7537429	I brought in a bunch of friends of mine from other forums that I was on to play with us too.
7537629	7538810	And like you, I quit for WoW.
7538930	7540391	I didn't quit that for WoW.
7542515	7543635	Oh, remember?
7543895	7544115	No, no.
7544176	7545656	I'm saying like you, the emailer.
7545936	7546596	I quit for a while.
7546736	7547797	Yeah.
7548537	7549437	I will say this, though.
7550457	7555519	During that Steam sale that we talked earlier about, the Abyssia edition, 12 bucks on Steam right now.
7556479	7557159	And you get the 30.
7558480	7559600	Loki just lit up.
7560280	7562000	No, no, I can't do that.
7563121	7565021	It's worth checking out.
7565041	7565561	You know what?
7565921	7566841	Go have a flirt.
7567501	7570342	Go have a kiki with Final Fantasy XI for 30 days.
7571382	7572562	And with your 12 bucks.
7572902	7574422	Just go see.
7574803	7575323	It's worth it.
7575423	7577143	I don't need more things to take away time.
7578203	7579503	I'm talking to the emailer again.
7581204	7582564	All right, that's my answer.
7582584	7584104	Did I hit all the questions in the email?
7584124	7584524	I hope I did.
7584544	7586324	Yeah, but now we need a Mass Effect MMO.
7587405	7588045	Is that it for emails?
7588485	7589365	Yes, but Mass Effect.
7589645	7592007	Give DarkSakura more emails to read.
7592087	7592808	Make her work.
7592888	7597252	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Let's do some angst.
7597292	7597932	You know what, Rob?
7598453	7599714	Let's not do some angst.
7599734	7603077	You're going to say that one time and I'm going to have laryngitis and you'll have to read them all.
7603417	7604138	I'll make Loki do it.
7604698	7605579	Or I'll get Alan in here.
7605779	7606019	Alan!
7607661	7607901	Alan!
7608181	7608822	Read emails.
7609562	7610303	Okay, let's be pissy.
7626793	7628055	F you to my indigestion.
7629096	7631258	I mean, I didn't really have anything that was unhealthy.
7632219	7636103	I ate salad, had beer, and coffee.
7637565	7638406	So what's up with that?
7642761	7653151	FU to a bunch of, well, FU to the fact that Nelly's car has a screw through the tire, so that was fun today, putting the donut on.
7654111	7658275	So I have to take off work tomorrow and get that fixed.
7659517	7661458	Which they'll do for free, so that's not so bad.
7661999	7662760	Still annoying.
7665180	7665760	Is that it?
7666220	7666861	Yeah, that's it.
7667321	7667981	My FU of the week.
7668061	7673383	I really don't have anything serious, so I guess I have to do something a little more superficial.
7674164	7680886	FU to the fact that I didn't get Civilization V for Alan on Steam when it was $8, and now it's up to a whole $14.
7680986	7681826	What am I going to do?
7683207	7683927	So much money.
7685208	7685688	God.
7686888	7690490	I could buy another copy of Final Fantasy Amicia Edition.
7692173	7692553	or not.
7693333	7697555	Alright, I'm sorry I don't have a better FU, but things are going pretty well, can't complain.
7698135	7704517	Alright, a few more stories for you guys, and then the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
7705137	7709638	And a few more news stories on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
7710418	7715540	As I mentioned, this week we're getting, well, we got a Minecraft update.
7716305	7718989	That's awesome!
7719009	7720190	1.73 was the update.
7720330	7725838	It added pistons and sticky pistons, and that's pretty awesome.
7726178	7729843	Shears, which you can now use to collect leaf blocks, which...
7731545	7737750	Don't really work out too well when you're, you know, making bushes, but you can make it work, I guess.
7738251	7752983	Also, now they have Flint and Steel or Redstone is required to detonate TNT, because it was annoying when I accidentally dropped TNT on the ground, and then I had to encase the thing in obsidian so that I wouldn't blow anything up in my house.
7753003	7753964	Okay.
7755726	7759448	Also, they're adding the option for character skins.
7760268	7772773	In fact, Monday, the 16th, they're going to be putting up a pack of character skins with 40 different skins for like 240 Microsoft points, which I'll probably be buying because that's a really good deal.
7773634	7775074	Yeah, but really?
7775154	7775655	Skins?
7776115	7776655	Whatever.
7776975	7778176	You don't even see yourself.
7778396	7780036	You only see in multiplayer.
7781437	7781737	I don't know.
7781837	7782817	I think it's a little silly.
7782877	7787939	But then again, I bought lots of silly crap for Mass Effect, so I'm not going to judge you much.
7788999	7790020	It's silly, but whatever.
7790940	7796521	The thing that is kind of annoying, though, is apparently the pistons don't work very well in Minecraft.
7796601	7800363	If you put too many near each other, the game will lag out or crash.
7801343	7803183	It can't handle the pistons, Captain!
7803523	7804044	It can't.
7804464	7808705	And that is unfortunate because you can't build some of the stuff that you can on the PC version.
7809525	7813069	Also, there's a new lightning engine that they added in there, which looks pretty nice.
7813809	7817412	Some people don't like it because it's too yellow, but I think it looks nice.
7818393	7825099	And then, of course, new textures for some of the objects, including cobblestone, which I like a lot better.
7825119	7825560	It's less...
7827601	7828622	Garish, I guess.
7829042	7834664	And then also, you're going to be getting some free stuff, Rob, if you don't like buying skins.
7834844	7836645	Now you're speaking my language.
7837905	7845208	On July 18th, you'll be able to get a customized Summer Arcade skin pack with five...
7846949	7864101	skins in that as well as also if you don't have Minecraft or you want to get some stuff for Trials Evolution you can get new theme tracks they're going to be once a week alongside each new game so that's kind of cool very cool
7864552	7868853	Pro Skater HD is coming out next week.
7870653	7871654	That could be pretty cool.
7873174	7878735	Chiggers in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Someone should build Castle Grayskull in Minecraft.
7878855	7879755	Surely that's happened.
7880035	7880816	I'm sure it's happened.
7881656	7886637	Remember, if you can dream it, it's probably happening on the internet right now.
7889693	7890894	I look it up, even.
7893095	7898999	Let's move on to one more news story tonight, officially, and that is about game movies.
7899179	7899779	Yay.
7899939	7900700	God of War.
7901780	7902701	Still supposed to happen.
7902761	7904382	Still supposed to become a movie at some point.
7904702	7909585	The screenplay is being rewritten by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan.
7909965	7911406	Don't recognize those names?
7911866	7914208	Well, you should pay attention to the credits of Saw 4, 5, and 6.
7916684	7918204	Feast 2, Sloppy Seconds, and Feast 3, The Happy Finish
7942750	7944452	They will be writing the God of War movie.
7944552	7946014	What about Feast 4, The Feastening?
7947135	7951740	Then again, does a God of War movie really need dialogue when it needs tits and violence?
7951801	7953803	I mean, that's really what we're looking for.
7953863	7955265	And certainly the Saw films have violence.
7955285	7957727	Well, we need someone to yell, you know, ARIES!
7961112	7962933	I really hate the Saw movies, you guys.
7963033	7963893	I really hate them.
7964234	7965154	I missed the last one.
7965374	7968076	And I haven't seen the rest of them, but I missed the last one.
7968096	7971237	Because you kind of have to see them all if you've already watched that many.
7971878	7976080	I would rather see this movie at this point, and this is also not my kind of movie.
7976500	7977660	Need for Speed.
7978321	7981302	Don't get me wrong, I like the games, but I'm not a big race car movie fan.
7982003	7984484	I'm not like the Fast and Furious stuff, and...
7989132	7992935	February 7th, 2014 is when the Need for Speed film is coming out.
7993235	7997918	That's amazing, considering they haven't shot any film yet, but I guess they're fast-tracking it.
7998399	8001941	It's going to be directed by an ex-stuntman, which I find interesting.
8002241	8004283	It's not based on a specific game in the series.
8004383	8006985	It's just Need for Speed on a racing movie.
8007005	8010567	I think it should just be based off the run, because that actually had a plot.
8010607	8013649	There will be cars and explosions, and that's all you want.
8013709	8014450	And hopefully...
8014850	8030175	Tits and Violence Maybe there'll be a cross promotion there God of War Racing TigerClaw in chat says Now the question is, is the God of War movie going to be PG-13 or R?
8030635	8040438	Chance with those people, it'll be a hard R given their connections with Saw Yeah, I'm with you, it's probably going to be a hard R Or a fuzzy NC-17
8042881	8045543	Because remember, violence is okay.
8045603	8047245	Decapitations, that's fine.
8047525	8049407	Torture, porn, A-okay.
8049467	8056132	You're a hard R. But if you show penis or vagina, you're NC-17.
8056533	8056813	Sorry.
8058394	8062898	Really, it's NC-17 if it's male anatomy being shown.
8063278	8066501	Well, I don't really care about anyone else's wee.
8066741	8067762	If you want to get technical...
8069102	8074726	You can show a lady's pubes and you can kind of show like the general thing from far back.
8075207	8076888	Like, you know, oh, I know what that is.
8077328	8082892	But if like the minute a labia shows up or is identifiable, now it's NC-17.
8084554	8085474	The more you know.
8087936	8095962	Okay, by the way, when anyone asked about doing the Castle of Lions, someone actually did Voltron in Minecraft.
8096443	8096803	Just saying.
8101210	8101551	Labia, Fuck
8117031	8135747	1-877-GAME-OLR I want one of those movies to be horribly misrated, like rated G for like, you know, the human centipede 4, 3 I have a friend that is totally into those movies Speaking of movies that are worse than Saw Oh my God
8136978	8139579	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
8139619	8142762	The Skype line is open right now for you guys to call in.
8143262	8145244	In the meantime, last minute stories, Loki?
8145724	8145884	Sure.
8146044	8147245	I was going to kind of comment.
8147265	8148366	I have some tweets too.
8148966	8151788	I was going to comment real quickly on the Ouya.
8152249	8161115	There was actually a Google Doc that some of the developers are keeping track of that shows all the people committed to it so far, including Exploding Rabbit.
8161155	8161736	Remember them?
8161776	8164598	They were the ones doing the Super Retro Squad game and also they did the
8165038	8169600	Mario Crossover stuff, Renegade Kid doing some stuff for them.
8172661	8173601	We'll go over some other stuff.
8173701	8175202	A lot of Kickstarter games.
8176062	8176962	Let's go to the phones.
8177183	8178263	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8178283	8178623	Who's this?
8181104	8183105	Hey, DarkTetsuya, what's on your mind, buddy?
8187546	8192028	So there's this Sorry, it's
8192458	8196079	Yeah, turn down the radio because you're going to get distracted when you hear yourself.
8196119	8198960	You'll be like, it's recursive Dark Tetsuya.
8202442	8204943	Sorry, I guess I heard something about this.
8205303	8207764	Sorry, I have to write down that I owe Travis Donovan a quarter.
8208044	8208944	Let me write that down.
8209284	8210745	I owe Travis 25 cents.
8210965	8211465	Okay, go ahead.
8214726	8216787	So there's this new service called Playism.
8216827	8219128	I don't know if it's mentioned on the show.
8219790	8220410	Playism?
8220630	8221391	Not familiar with it?
8221431	8222291	You know that, Loki?
8222311	8223632	Yeah, because they have a lot of Mulana.
8224813	8226834	Oh, I see where this is going.
8228295	8228615	Yes.
8232257	8232577	Yes.
8233077	8233878	Go ahead.
8235759	8236119	Go ahead.
8239000	8242182	No, the neat thing is all these games don't have any DRM on them.
8245024	8248606	Well, thank God, because Ubisoft can go...
8249761	8252623	Yep, 15 bucks, no DRM I'm just curious, are you getting paid off by the devs of La Mulana?
8271075	8271255	No.
8272115	8273095	Because if not, you should be.
8273495	8274456	Yeah, you really should be.
8274736	8281197	You should think about, like, when we write our letter to Pinkberry demanding free Pinkberry, you really need to get a free copy of La Mulana.
8283457	8286098	Yeah, I probably should.
8288338	8291679	Why do you love La Mulana so freaking much, Dark Tetsuya?
8293719	8294099	I don't know.
8294159	8298620	It's got, like, a really great story and this huge world you can explore.
8298660	8299140	It's like a
8300410	8302251	Metroid or Castlevania or something.
8304093	8304573	You know what?
8304653	8306174	It's got to have tits in it somewhere.
8306234	8307435	That's what it is, isn't it?
8307455	8309276	There's a tit scene.
8309736	8310217	Okay, maybe not.
8310237	8310917	Yeah, bird.
8313019	8315400	Well, this new one does have a new female character in it.
8316301	8316761	Oh, hey!
8318482	8319723	I guess I wasn't too far from the truth.
8320183	8320444	All right.
8321044	8321704	Dark Tits to you.
8321744	8324967	So everybody go check out La Mulana ASAP.
8325987	8326868	Anything else you want to plug?
8329131	8332974	Just the site, playism-en.com to go check that out.
8334355	8338258	You know, I'm really thinking you should go get a job with them, Mr. Social Network Manager.
8338578	8339178	You'd do great.
8340019	8341140	I should look into that.
8341200	8342020	You absolutely should.
8342260	8343181	All right, Dark Ted, see you.
8343221	8344102	Thanks for calling.
8344182	8344782	Take care, buddy.
8345303	8346063	Not a problem.
8346223	8346543	Bye.
8348525	8348805	Love it.
8348905	8350006	All right, we got another call coming in.
8350046	8351147	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8351187	8351547	Who's this?
8355290	8355750	Hello?
8355770	8355870	Hello?
8356994	8357834	Hey, how's it going?
8358295	8358655	Travis.
8359095	8359875	Hi, Travis.
8361156	8361736	Hey, how's it going?
8361916	8362536	Hey, what's up?
8362636	8364217	You don't have like a cool nickname?
8364237	8365497	You just go by Travis?
8365637	8372400	I mean, not that that's a bad name, but... No, it's Tito1381, but I just want to apologize to Jamie for having such sucky grammar.
8372460	8375741	I know that I suck at it.
8376642	8379463	No, but I was just wanting to... I mean, thank you very much for...
8381443	8382304	Answer my email.
8382745	8383385	I'm glad to hear it.
8383425	8387550	I'm probably going to get back into Final Fantasy XI because it was one of my favorite games.
8388010	8388951	Uh-oh, you're stuck.
8389171	8389892	They've got you.
8390212	8390833	That's right.
8391374	8393136	Run while you can!
8393396	8401585	Square Enix owes me a quarter for getting Travis back into Final Fantasy XI, so I'm just going to sign the back of the check to Travis Donovan.
8402867	8404028	for stealing jokes.
8404128	8406489	It's so much fun to know that I can get back on it for only $12.
8406989	8410450	And I was definitely on the Steam today and I was like, oh yeah, there it is, $12.
8410750	8414552	So I'm probably going to get back on it and jump back on it and just test it out again.
8414592	8417473	And I am another one that's waiting for Guild Wars 2 to come out.
8417513	8418894	So I'm excited about that as well.
8419054	8424957	It's a great, and it works perfectly because if you start now, your 30-day trial will be up like the week before Guild Wars 2 is out.
8425777	8426217	Exactly.
8427198	8428178	Now here's a question for you.
8428218	8429459	Did you ever play Final Fantasy XIV?
8430976	8432317	I never did, no.
8432837	8435459	It's better left into your imagination.
8436960	8437700	It's not pretty.
8437880	8441242	They should have just made 11 with high definition graphics and they didn't do that.
8441302	8445165	They made something a lot sadder, sadly.
8446005	8457332	I'll be honest with you, I was so excited about it once I heard about it because I was like, oh wow, another MMO from Final Fantasy and then all of a sudden I heard about how horrible it was doing it right in the beginning and I was like, no, it can't happen.
8457812	8458653	It can't happen like this.
8459355	8462116	It was just rushed, and it's unfortunate.
8462216	8464236	I don't know what the hell they were thinking.
8464636	8468917	They said they were getting inspiration from World of Warcraft and stuff, and I didn't see any of that.
8469037	8482481	I saw that they were trying to do some of the 60-minute things you could do in more bite sizes that you do in Final Fantasy XI, and I respect them for that, but Final Fantasy XI implemented some of those things and kind of one-upped it.
8482561	8487282	It's really weird when you're thinking like, gosh, Final Fantasy XI, I really missed that game.
8487302	8487442	XIV, eh.
8489537	8490438	Yeah, exactly.
8490738	8492479	Well, congratulations on 10 years, guys.
8492499	8494020	And like I said, you got a devoted fan.
8494060	8494960	I love you guys a lot.
8495141	8496662	And thanks for keeping me entertained.
8497142	8498403	We're glad to have you.
8499223	8504887	And yeah, I only point out the grammar of the people I care about, which is everyone.
8504907	8506208	She teases because she loves.
8506368	8506688	All right.
8507208	8513032	Well, crack open a grammar book, and we hope to hear from you again about your experiences back in Final Fantasy XI.
8513092	8515634	Because you might go back in there and be like, Rob...
8516334	8516994	You are wrong.
8517034	8518795	This game is all fucked up and I hate it.
8518955	8521677	You have my permission to call Rob a bitch if he's misled you.
8522077	8522677	Gee, thanks.
8525218	8526219	Anything else on your mind, Travis?
8527420	8527840	That's it.
8528040	8528860	Alright, take care, buddy.
8530421	8532582	Hey, Rob.
8533342	8534123	We should get a ferret.
8535103	8535484	For real.
8536604	8539686	They're not that smelly.
8540206	8541466	Start a Kickstarter to make a real ferret.
8541486	8542547	How about we go to another call?
8542607	8543848	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8543888	8544248	Who's this?
8546069	8551653	This is Vormay, but I'm not in chat right now because I'm using the iPhone right now.
8551853	8552473	That's alright.
8552553	8553014	Oh, I see.
8553054	8556756	With the iPhone, you can't... You gotta just use the phone part.
8556776	8557217	That's alright.
8557237	8557777	What's up, buddy?
8559859	8567644	I was just wanting to talk about the import issue that was going on last week with the Final Fantasy Theater.
8567664	8568625	And... I guess also the...
8575813	8584580	Well, yeah, I was going to say the import issue was specifically about Persona, am I right?
8584660	8589964	Because there's the whole issue where it's... He hung up.
8591145	8592466	You don't want to talk to us anymore?
8592506	8592946	What happened?
8594856	8595717	Thanks for watching!
8616238	8629646	Well, I'm going to see if that number comes back through because I want to know a little more about what his perspective was on that because I kind of think we got it out there in the open last week that, well, we never did resolve the Theatrhythm thing, but obviously we have the different opinions on that.
8630006	8638151	And then as far as the Persona games go, we didn't see the point for getting really upset about it because they are putting out the exact same game in both regions.
8638532	8644035	I only get pissed about region locking when Japan gets these games that either we never get...
8645576	8647478	Take President Cat was a perfect example.
8647799	8653445	It was this whimsical, silly game that they should have really made it here.
8653645	8656408	Why can't I import it if they're never going to release it ever, ever?
8657109	8658190	Maybe it would have sold better.
8659091	8659431	I don't know.
8661573	8663035	They bring a lot of weird stuff over here.
8663055	8665017	I'm surprised that never did come over here.
8665663	8666844	DarkSakura, pay attention
8694292	8697874	Universal Studios and Konami are partnering.
8698034	8701897	Universal Studios, and I'm not talking about the movie studio, I'm talking about the amusement park.
8702057	8704058	You know, there's one in Orlando, there's one here in LA.
8704538	8708200	They are teaming up together for Halloween Horror Nights.
8708681	8716085	And apparently, Silent Hill is going to be getting a replica at this year's Halloween Horror Nights.
8716966	8720628	That is going to be this October at both the Hollywood and Orlando parks.
8722115	8722875	Ooh, wait, when?
8723775	8724435	Just for Halloween?
8724576	8725276	October, yeah.
8725316	8726536	They do something like all month long.
8726556	8730357	Well, because if I go down for Disneyland, that means I'll be down in the area.
8730477	8741639	Yes, our other friends, Adrian and Gabe, who don't listen to this show, but they always take a day and not go to Disneyland, but they go to Universal Studios.
8741999	8744599	So you should think about doing something similar and go to Silent Hill.
8744619	8745999	I've never been to Universal Studios.
8746039	8747840	But please don't get killed by Pyramid Head.
8748560	8748780	Okay.
8749640	8750560	or at least give him a hug.
8750640	8751120	I'll hump him.
8751200	8753601	That same number is calling back, so I want to try and get back to the phone.
8753641	8754101	Hi, you there?
8755502	8756822	Yes, I'm sorry about that.
8756962	8758603	I think I just took the iPhone.
8758963	8760203	See, I called it, I called it.
8760503	8763484	All right, so what was it you wanted to say about it?
8763524	8768405	I mean, do you have perspective on it or were you looking for our perspective or what's your opinion on the whole region locking?
8769646	8777908	Okay, well, I normally pick up import games on the regular and I picked up the rhythm back in February and March.
8778704	8802278	and it was great and I also was about to pick up Persona Arena until I found out that they were going to region lock it only because I didn't buy the PS3 in Japan because it wasn't region locked but this issue really doesn't have anything to do with America this is more like Japan I think afraid of you know
8802751	8808293	Japanese people stopped buying their games because, you know, I tend to, you know, play a lot of Japanese RPGs.
8808453	8818557	I can read Japanese pretty effectively online and, you know, I kind of even like, you know, help out with the little community that they have, especially with the Tales games.
8818637	8830462	So, I just wanted to just, you know, let people know that if you really want to, like, you know, to play, like, any employee games, you know, the prices for us won't really change.
8831614	8832875	and this is really for Japan.
8832915	8836176	This is really for like maybe having Japan have, you know, cheaper prices.
8836416	8845899	But the people that buy games out there don't really, you know, pay too much attention to, you know, the gaming environment here in America.
8846399	8848200	It's a whole different environment over there.
8848220	8854242	You know, people, I mean, like games are always $100, PS3 games or I think theater would be worth $80.
8855487	8869635	Sure and I remember hearing a lot about that that the finances was it was maybe more region locked to protect the Japanese version of the game because it was going to be more expensive and people were legit worried that they were just going to be importing copies from America.
8870055	8881581	Let me ask you this though from a consumer perspective or the gamer perspective you and I and especially somebody like you who plays a lot of import games and you know definitely I'm sure cares about
8881841	8886443	Right, it's okay because I believe it's coming out for America within two weeks of the release of the Japanese one.
8886463	8886523	Yes.
8905373	8911737	So, you know, I just, you know, I just, I was listening to Bobby Blackwell's show as well, a consecutive over two years.
8911777	8919261	I think I assumed that you kind of believed what Bobby was saying and his friends, you know, about him, how he was going to boycott bears.
8919962	8920382	I don't know.
8921022	8924324	All I was trying to say was that I just really thought people need to just relax.
8924985	8926425	It isn't too much of a problem.
8926445	8927366	This is a big,
8927864	8939527	You know, Japan problem, you know, because when they have their game out, you know, they literally, you know, the prices, I think Final Fantasy XIII, when I bought it, which is from Japan, was like $115, no joke.
8939827	8943488	Then, like, two weeks later, because people had a problem with it, it dropped to, like, $50.
8943748	8946869	This is, like, in Japan.
8947009	8950890	Imports never, like, changed their prices, the websites.
8951250	8952811	But in Japan, that's how it was.
8953317	8968809	I don't want to speak for Bobby because I'm not Bobby, but I believe his perspective was pretty similar to ours where I think he really didn't understand why people, the consumers, were getting so upset about the region locking because it was the same game coming out in both regions.
8970610	8981434	They had taken the extra step to preserve the Japanese language track even because they know the target audience for these types of games usually tends to overlap a lot with the same type of people that are really into Japanese culture.
8981755	8984936	So he wasn't understanding why people were getting so upset about it.
8984996	8987977	I think he kind of saw it from the same perspective we're getting at now.
8988357	8990698	I don't know about the callers.
8991718	8995420	He just clarified in chat, I have no problem with the region locking of Persona 4 for the record.
8996932	9000795	Okay, so if the games continue to come out like that
9001614	9004476	I guess America wouldn't really see much of a problem.
9005177	9006177	Is that what you're saying?
9031594	9040478	and then we have to wait six months after that, which that's not even the part that really bothers me because Europe sometimes gets that end of the shaft.
9040618	9041599	It kind of works in reverse.
9041919	9043359	So that part doesn't really bother me.
9043660	9047041	But A, the Wii's region lock, so I can't really import it.
9047441	9051863	And B, when they end up releasing it here, it's a fucking GameStop exclusive.
9052143	9053204	That pissed me off.
9054484	9055045	Exactly.
9055185	9060027	Yeah, see, this is what I really think is going to be the next...
9061719	9072883	for gamers that are playing games here in America or in Europe or in Japan because now our worlds are being flattened and now we can actually see it a little bit more and more people are buying games.
9072943	9078405	I really feel like a consumer that wanted to play Xenoblade would have found the way to play it.
9078465	9082106	Whether they would have imported it or pirated it, they would have found their way to playing it.
9082326	9088848	So for them to wait six months only hurts them because I don't even walk into a GameStop anymore.
9089704	9092947	I'm going to go ahead and buy any different GameStop.
9092987	9098651	It's either to buy a console that's region locked, or if there's a particular reason, I need a cable or something.
9098691	9106696	But anything, I think the average employee gamer is savvy enough to buy games online or in other ways.
9106777	9108298	Like the Kavita.
9108818	9111940	The new Hatsune Miku is going to be coming out here.
9111980	9113661	It's a music simulation game.
9113701	9114362	People like it.
9114997	9143026	but it may not come out here for a while but whoever likes those games can now download them from the I believe they can buy them from the Playstation store if they buy Japanese Vita which makes it great because it kind of bypasses the import problem so I just think we're going to see this more and more as time goes on it's going to be great because I think that some of the games that are actually coming out you can play them even if you don't know any Japanese you know
9146423	9148165	I think you and I are on similar pages.
9148225	9156555	I think if Project D.Va and all that was on the same page as Persona 4 and the way they're doing it, region locking wouldn't bug me whatsoever.
9156655	9159319	But unfortunately, you gotta remember the roots of this show.
9159819	9178187	We were hardcore DDR and Beatmania fans, and for so long, Konami's putting out all these great Beatmania 2DX mixes in Japan, and then they put one out here that, sure, it's got a better controller slightly, because they've had some time to perfect it, but then the song list itself, bleh.
9178907	9183409	And there really ain't shit you can do about it on the PlayStation 2, but get a Japanese PlayStation 2.
9184090	9184590	It's crazy.
9185908	9186148	All right.
9187489	9188870	Well, thanks so much for the call, buddy.
9188930	9191151	I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
9191391	9193332	But I think we're on the same page with the region stuff.
9193352	9195513	I appreciate you sharing your perspective on that.
9196774	9197214	No problem.
9197234	9197534	Thank you.
9197554	9197875	Take care.
9197895	9198135	All right.
9198175	9198515	Take care, buddy.
9200285	9201606	That's going to do it for calls tonight.
9201666	9204349	Thank you guys who were able to get through and call in.
9204389	9205971	If you didn't get through, I'm very sorry.
9206331	9208193	But send us an email quick while it's on your mind.
9208933	9214639	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Or you can always send us tweets because we don't get a whole lot of them.
9215019	9218463	Let me read one more tweet here and then I'll check in with Loki one more time for last minute stories.
9219143	9221526	I don't know if you guys have heard of Crunchyroll.
9222458	9223759	Yes, the anime service.
9223999	9224559	Yep.
9224619	9232142	Korean dramas and animes are coming to the PlayStation 3 with the Crunchyroll app and Neon Alley apps.
9232263	9238685	It'll be $6.95 for the anime or drama library or you can get both for $11.95 a month.
9238725	9239286	That's pretty cool.
9240906	9243147	I hear Korean dramas are all kinds of awesome.
9243188	9244368	I haven't really watched any myself.
9244408	9245208	I don't know if these are subtitled.
9245228	9246429	I've watched a lot of Japanese dramas.
9247930	9250731	But Rob, anime doesn't need an S to make it plural.
9253271	9254372	I wanted to give it one anyway.
9256454	9263799	Neon Alley is a separate thing that's $6.99 a month and it has uncut anime all available with English dubs.
9264360	9265801	It hasn't been circumcised.
9267402	9267903	There you go.
9268904	9270285	Loki, any other last minute stories?
9274796	9275476	No.
9276136	9276577	All right.
9276737	9277097	Really?
9277757	9278237	That's all right.
9278277	9279238	Yeah, I don't want to talk about that.
9279398	9279838	That's all right.
9279898	9280198	All right.
9280599	9280979	Fair enough.
9281299	9283420	Well, that takes us to the end of the show.
9283620	9284120	I want to thank you.
9284160	9284660	Already?
9285061	9285361	Yeah.
9286261	9286581	Wow.
9287142	9288742	No, it's almost nine o'clock.
9288823	9293205	It was maybe about two and a half hours tonight, but we had some pretty epically long shows.
9294338	9295078	I hope she went to sleep
9318126	9321248	Well, I want to thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
9321308	9322429	We really appreciate the support.
9322469	9324630	We heard from some new people tonight, which is really cool.
9325170	9326431	That means word is spreading.
9326531	9327191	Thank you guys.
9327832	9330133	If you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, it is a free show.
9330253	9332615	All we ask, tell a friend or two about the show.
9332915	9334796	Help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
9334876	9339339	I think some of our new listeners are coming from PlayStation Home and all the stuff going on there.
9339719	9343361	And I know I've got Blender and Skull and some of those people to thank for that.
9343661	9344241	TotalEclipseBlackAle
9369013	9369993	Good job.
9370193	9371034	Would drink again.
9371374	9373775	And I have another 22 ounce beer sitting in the fridge.
9374015	9376856	I love that they didn't give you a tiny beer.
9376896	9378336	Like it wasn't a Bud Light sized beer.
9378376	9379257	This is a beer.
9379417	9380097	It's like two pints.
9380517	9380857	Nice.
9381498	9382758	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
9383263	9384124	My stomach hurts.
9384204	9384884	I'm going to go home.
9386625	9386765	Aw.
9386905	9387706	Loki, your final thought.
9388046	9391488	I have joined both Steam communities now, so I'm all good.
9392388	9404095	I just need to install Borderlands now because of the two games, I wanted to install one before I came to the show, and I chose Skyrim because it was much smaller to install.
9405336	9406837	I'm actually running out of hard drive space.
9406877	9407437	That's not good.
9408837	9411438	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9411458	9412578	We'll be back next week.
9412778	9415279	Sadly, DarkSakura will not be here.
9415679	9416480	I won't be sad.
9416900	9418060	Well, we'll be sad.
9418380	9418960	No, no, no.
9419140	9420281	I will miss the show.
9420341	9422041	But it's Tiara's wedding.
9422241	9423022	We all know Tiara.
9423142	9424262	Yeah, absolutely.
9424422	9425603	Happy wedding to Tiara.
9425623	9428263	And if I remember, I'll play the song next week for them.
9430604	9449729	so if Alan's not working he might co-host I also want to reach out to Flaco Jones because he needs to hopefully make up for the lost show I don't know if he can or not we will figure something out we will try to find someone to fill your shoes DarkSakura even though they are big shoes to fill I think I've got someone for you oh sweet happy with that
9450134	9451234	Have a great week, everybody.
9451614	9452235	Be safe.
9452795	9453535	Don't be jerks.
9454175	9457316	Have fun playing all those games on the Steam sale.
9457436	9462037	Loki is waiting for you to join the VOG community and kick his ass at Borderlands.
9462957	9464377	Well, it's co-op, I mean.
9464577	9466398	All right, then don't kick his ass.
9466958	9467998	We'll kick ass together.
9468098	9468698	There you go.
9468899	9469599	Hey, I got mail.
9470739	9471419	I got an invite.
9471519	9472679	I got mail, yay.
9473560	9474040	Bye, guys.
