0	14000	This is your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Lowkey!
14000	19640	Tonight July 15th, 2012, a popular comic book character is getting his own game.
19640	25280	One PC game claims an Apple IOS game stole from them without permission, and Amazon announces
25280	27480	a new gaming service.
27480	35280	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35280	37640	where every gamer has a voice.
37640	40380	Yes, it's Orange Lounge Radio, just like the intro said.
40380	43760	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about
43760	46680	video games and all that fun stuff with my co-hosts.
46680	49400	Joining me here, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
49400	50400	Hi.
50400	51680	How are you, Jamie Summers?
51680	52680	Caffeinated.
52680	53680	Welcome back.
53680	54680	You weren't here last week.
54680	55680	Feeling better?
55680	56680	No.
56680	57680	I was here last week.
57680	58680	Sorry to hear it.
58680	60800	I feel infinitely better this week.
60800	61800	Glad to hear it.
61800	62800	So, yes.
62800	64160	And then you'll be gone next week?
64160	66360	Yes, I will be at Tiara's wedding.
66360	70160	You have a great time off program through the network, don't you?
70160	75500	No, I suppose a wedding between two people that inadvertently met because of Orange Lounge
75500	78040	Radio could be acceptable.
78040	79040	Not really.
79040	82320	We can't take that much credit, but sort of, sort of, a little bit.
82320	83920	One thing leads to another.
83920	85160	That's right.
85160	86960	I'm also joining us here in studio.
86960	88440	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
88440	89440	Hi.
89440	90440	Hi, Loki.
90440	91440	How are you?
91440	92440	Doing fine.
92440	96840	Going through my spam and trying to delete 20 pages of spam.
96840	98120	I hate spam.
98120	101360	Why can't we, why can't the internet stop spam?
101360	102360	That's what I want to know.
102360	109040	Why won't Howie Mandel stop emailing me about, what is it?
109040	111280	You've been selected to be on Deal or No Deal?
111280	112280	Oh, I know.
112280	115560	I just keep ignoring him, you know, over and over.
115560	117440	And here they really want me on Deal or No Deal.
117440	122920	My favorite is on the mailbag address for the show here, mailbagandorangehouseradio.com.
122920	124740	We get all this French spam.
124740	128720	Like it's not just spam, it's un fran√ßais.
128720	131200	Like who signed us up for French spam?
131200	132200	I hate you.
132200	133200	I personally hate you.
133200	134800	Let's see what else we got here.
134800	136900	Are you losing money on your website?
136900	139880	The 100% all natural metabolism booster.
139880	142560	Incredibly low prices on 2011 cars.
142560	145480	What does that have to, meh.
145480	147200	Maybe that's how we can make money with VOG.
147200	150040	Don't you kids want some metabolism boosters?
150040	154840	How would you like to have a bigger dick?
154840	156660	We sell them detachable.
156660	158680	Is your car hurting your pocket?
158680	161720	I can almost, I wish spammusement was still around because that would be hilarious.
161720	164680	That was my favorite webcomic back in the day.
164680	168400	Like with all due respect, screw Penny Arcade.
168400	172280	Forget the oatmeal, it was all about spammusement back in the day.
172280	173280	That was like the funniest.
173280	174280	Get a bigger flute.
174280	176960	Actually the site is still up, they just haven't updated it.
176960	177960	I know.
177960	178960	We should take it over.
178960	180440	You are so good to me eggplant Mike.
180440	182840	That was my favorite.
182840	184480	All right, anyhow.
184480	186840	Welcome to Internet Jokes from 2004.

214840	217520	Although, you can now check in to the podcast as well.
217520	218520	That's been going for a couple weeks.
218520	220700	I have a little more on that in a minute.
220700	223760	But first, let's do tonight's kickoff topic.
223760	228760	All right, so last week, Loki and I held down the fort without Dark Sakura.
228760	231480	Somehow it still ended up being like an over three-hour show.
231480	234680	It was probably that whole little debate we were having on theater.
234680	239160	Oh, I didn't even remember that, but now I do.
239160	244400	Yeah, that's what caused the show to go a little long, but that's all right.
244400	248880	Anyhow, we were talking about theater and all that stuff, but one of the other things
248880	252520	we talked about, towards the end of the show, kind of, like I don't want to say it's a throwaway,
252520	256840	but it was one of those things we were like, oh, we hear about things like this all the
256840	257840	time and whatever.
257840	261360	And it was about this system, when we were joking, it was called the, oh yeah.
261360	265120	Like, you remember, it's like the, we were looking at the name, we're like the oh yeah,
265120	268760	the oo-yeah, the ow-yeah, how about, oh yeah.
268760	271760	So we started calling it the oh yeah, and we were like, whatever.
271760	275480	You know, we hear about these little consoles all the time.
275480	279080	Well, a lot can change in the scope of a week.
279080	282420	Turns out, we didn't know this last week when we reported on it, the whole thing ended up
282420	284440	being a Kickstarter.
284440	287920	And they Kickstarted, and they've gone through the roof of Kickstarter.
287920	293880	They've already raised almost five million dollars on Kickstarter to date.
293880	297720	And it's all for this console that technically doesn't exist yet.
297720	302620	It's had a lot of interesting upsies and downsies going on, like for example, you know, obviously
302620	307280	the up part is, you know, thousands of people are pre-ordering it, causing it to go through
307280	309120	five million dollars.
309120	312800	supporters just kicked back and made, what, about a quarter million dollars, half a million
312800	316500	dollars off of them.
316500	321480	The downs are that we don't really have an actual system.
321480	324160	We have prototypes, imaginings.
324160	328560	We also have screenshots of proposed things that will come to the system, and one of them
328560	334920	is Minecraft, to which Notch, the guy behind Minecraft, came out and said, actually, no,
334920	336520	we're not putting Minecraft on this.
336520	340840	I mean, they might be talking about Minecraft Android Edition or whatever, but that sucks.
340840	342600	We're not supporting it anymore.
342600	344640	It's not going to be on Oya.
344640	350720	And their response is basically, well, just tell these companies what you want.
350720	353320	Tell them what you want, what you really, really want.
353320	356800	And we'll magically get all these games to show up on the console.
356800	357800	You know what?
357800	358800	I wanted a Phantom.
358800	361080	My chances sound just as good.
361080	362080	All right.
362080	370240	Well, in a funny, interesting twist of fate, Loki, tell us about your story with this console
370240	371240	this week.
371240	375720	I backed it, right, as it came up.
375720	377560	What made you decide that it's worth it?
377560	381320	Because, I don't know, for some reason it just kind of surprised me.
381320	385560	Because it's cheap, at the very least.
385560	390800	Because it's so hackable, you know, if the console part of it just kind of fails and
390800	392760	they do deliver on the product.
392760	395640	I believe that there still will be stuff that will be supported on it.
395640	398840	I think there's already a lot of games that would be supported on it, especially ones
398840	404220	that support Bluetooth controllers and that kind of thing.
404220	405220	So there's that.
405220	408880	And then, of course, like I said, the hackable part where you could basically turn this into
408880	410480	like a streaming box.
410480	418800	Or if you want to go that far, you could say turn it into almost like a web TV type thing,
418800	422920	where it's hooked up to your TV and you're, you know, checking Facebook, you know, Twitter,
422920	426000	that kind of stuff on it.
426000	429220	Because I don't really have anything like, I mean, let me put it this way.
429220	435120	I've been using the Xbox 360 recently to watch YouTube for my son.
435120	439500	We stream episodes of Caillou because they're like five minutes long.
439500	442560	And that app fucking sucks.
442560	446640	I have to reboot the app every time a video ends because it starts stuttering the next
446640	448320	video.
448320	449320	And it pisses me off.
449320	451320	My phone doesn't have that problem.
451320	454420	You know, our Nook tablet doesn't have that problem.
454420	456280	My iPod doesn't have that problem.
456280	460960	But this fucking app that they put out on an Xbox 360 just sucks balls.
460960	464360	So I'd rather have something that would work for streaming, that kind of stuff.
464360	468600	Or, you know, I don't necessarily want to dig out my PS3 or my 360 because it's not
468600	472520	always hooked up to the TV to stream video from my computer.
472520	477800	And then I could do that with, you know, an app, say, VLC player or something like that,
477800	479200	using this device.
479200	481040	So it could use it as a streaming device as well.
481040	483560	I have something that does all of that and it didn't cost me anything.
483560	487080	I have a computer hooked up to my TV that was just given to us because they were going
487080	488080	to throw it away.
488080	489080	It does all of that.
489080	490080	Okay.
490080	491080	Yes.
491080	492080	I can go dumpster diving for a computer.
492080	493080	I can use one of the millions of...
493080	494080	It was given to me.
494080	495080	I didn't dumpster dive for it.
495080	500440	But to be fair, you are kind of dancing around the fact that there is a value to that.
500440	502500	Somebody gave it to you for free because they like you.
502500	504360	If you want to go out and get a computer...
504360	506920	I could build the same thing for under a hundred bucks.
506920	509200	Well, let's go down that road.
509200	510800	Why not a PC?
510800	512600	Why this box?
512600	513600	I want to hear it out.
513600	516840	I want to hear all sides to this because I don't know where I sit with this, honestly.
516840	518680	I could build a PC and put it in there.
518680	523700	But the thing is, I'd rather have something smaller and compact and it looks nice.
523700	524840	And it could play games on it.
524840	527080	Yeah, I could easily do that.
527080	531400	Or I could just stick with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and not have to pay anything
531400	534360	to have it stream to my TV.
534360	539400	But at the same time, I can use this... a PC, for example, you're going to need a keyboard
539400	542440	mouse to interact with it.
542440	547440	And that's kind of cumbersome when I want to be kind of wireless from this whole PC
547440	548440	thing.
548440	551200	I mean, sure, I could get a wireless mouse and keyboard, and I've done that before.
551200	552200	We've had...
552200	557280	I was going to say, back in the OLR mansion, when you and I lived together, we actually
557280	561600	had a computer hooked up to the TV that we used to feed chat room to the living room,
561600	562600	remember?
562600	563600	Yeah.
563600	564960	And it was in the arcade cabinet.
564960	566440	So it served like a double purpose.
566440	570880	Or I could wheel out the arcade cabinet that I have into the living room, but I don't really
570880	572000	want to do that.
572000	577700	Well, like, our computer that's hooked up to our TV is in an unobtrusive location.
577700	581920	You can't really... you don't really notice it unless you're looking down at it.
581920	588120	You know, we've got the remote... our keyboard is one of those little clamshell things that
588120	589660	Logitech puts out.
589660	591720	And it's completely unobtrusive.
591720	594480	We watch full movies on it in HD quality.
594480	598320	You know, never have any lag unless it's the internet that's lagging.
598320	600320	You know, we've played games on it too.
600320	605160	Dan's got emulators hooked up to it, penmame, you know, all kinds of stuff.
605160	608720	And I mean, it would run most of the stuff that's on Steam right now.
608720	611400	You know, especially the indie games.
611400	615080	And on top of that, you know, if any of our friends wants to bring over a computer and
615080	617040	hook it up to our TV, the connections are there.
617040	619200	Just change out the wires.
619200	625040	We don't have to buy a vapor, something that doesn't exist and probably won't be worth
625040	626040	the money.
626040	628520	How do you feel about Apple TV?
628520	629720	I'm not investing in that either.
629720	631760	I have a PC.
631760	635360	I was just curious because to me, there's a lot of similarities between the two, except
635360	638560	one of them is not coming from a little indie company.
638560	642480	It's coming from, you know, the biggest company in America or one or two.
642480	643480	I don't know.
643480	646080	Them and Exxon keep flip flopping, but whatever, you get my point.
646080	648680	You know, one of them is coming from the biggest company anywhere.
648680	651720	And the other one is, you know, this company nobody's heard of, but essentially they're
651720	653260	kind of the same thing.
653260	658480	It's just that Apple TV doesn't do games yet, but I think we all know that will be built
658480	659480	in eventually.
659480	661600	I mean, there's...
661600	666080	And then it's just going to be the Apple fans versus the anti-Apple crowd all over again.
666080	669520	I think there's a lot of like startups and stuff, and everybody seems to focus on the
669520	675160	Phantom and consoles of that sort that flopped because, you know, they don't know who these
675160	676160	people are.
676160	681040	But the guy that's doing the design is behind that, you know, one laptop per child.
681040	682300	That wasn't vaporware.
682300	686040	People were paying money for that, you know, to get a $50 laptop or whatever, and that
686040	688100	ended up, you know, turning out just fine.
688100	692000	So he has a little bit of credit, you know, he has a little bit of a, you know, reputation
692000	693000	to uphold there.
693000	695040	With something established and tangible.
695040	698580	Yes, I understand that, but it wasn't when people were ordering it.
698580	699580	It wasn't made yet.
699580	700580	It was just...
700580	701600	But laptops existed at the time.
701600	702600	I understand that.
702600	707560	To be able to create a laptop that's that cheap with, you know, parts, it was very customized.
707560	710120	I mean, try building a laptop for 50 bucks.
710120	711120	Good luck.
711120	712120	Been done.
712120	715560	All right, let's see this laptop that you've done.
715560	717080	Well, I'm not building them.
717080	719280	I'm just saying that people have been doing it.
719280	720280	To be fair.
720280	722440	You make it sound like it's so goddamn fucking easy to find a $50 laptop.
722440	724560	Let me just pull one out of my asshole right here.
724560	725560	Let me jump in.
725560	726560	Just be...
726560	729280	I truly do feel like I'm neutral on this topic.
729280	733220	I kinda want one, but I gotta see it in action first.
733220	737400	And I don't wanna see theories and maybes, impossibilities.
737400	739780	I want it on the E3 show floor.
739780	744300	And I want it to be the public to give an honest opinion on it.
744300	745360	That's where I'm at.
745360	751080	But I'm not quite in the camp of no way, no how, never, either, or that it's like a waste.
751080	752080	I'm kind of in between.
752080	757880	But to be fair, I have heard these stories about the kids in countries where they don't
757880	762240	have a lot of money in the education system, about that there are these charity programs
762240	767400	that are getting these super cheap laptops that are like $75, $100 in these classrooms.
767400	768800	Yes, that's that laptop.
768800	769800	Yeah, that...
769800	775280	I mean, so they're not great, but to say, yes, there is a such thing as a $100 laptop,
775280	777800	but they're not exactly gonna do much, but...
777800	783640	You can buy a smartphone for, you know, $75 to $100, it may not be like all the things
783640	789200	that my iPhone are, but it'll do all the same stuff the laptop will.
789200	794700	I mean, if they can put them in a phone, they can build a laptop.
794700	798800	But those phones you're talking about, unless they're prepaid phones, and trust me, $75
798800	800880	prepaid phones are not good phones.
800880	802280	Dan's last Android phone was like $100.
802280	804200	Yeah, but was that with a contract?
804200	808800	Going down this road a minute, though, the Ouya, the Ouya kind of is a phone, isn't it?
808800	812960	I mean, Android is a phone and tablet operating system.
812960	818640	Basically, it's got the same specs or very similar specs to the new quad-core processor
818640	820320	tablet that they have coming out.
820320	822960	So it's like a tablet that's hooked up to a TV.
822960	827880	Would it be correct to say that basically what Ouya is gonna do is it's gonna be a smartphone
827880	829880	on your TV without the phone calls?
829880	833320	It's gonna be a tablet on your TV without...
833320	837520	And without touchscreen capability, which all these games run on.
837520	842840	Which I'm okay with, actually, because I'm over touchscreen games.
842840	846560	And you were talking about this during Bobby's show when Bobby was kind of grilling you on
846560	847560	this too.
847560	851680	You were mentioning like you wanna play some of these games that are on like PC and stuff
851680	852680	right now.
852680	856560	Let's say a game like Terraria, but you wanna play it with a controller on your TV the way
856560	857560	games are meant to be played.
857560	860520	I have a controller that I use for Steam that isn't...
860520	862800	But not every game supports it.
862800	864520	So?
864520	865520	And I...
865520	866520	We don't always get what we want.
866520	871360	I can understand the angle of wanting to play things on your couch in the living room as
871360	873320	opposed to in your...
873320	877360	It would be hypocritical of me to say I don't understand that viewpoint because I've purposely
877360	881520	bought games on the console because I want to plop my fat ass on the couch, kick back,
881520	883680	and have my Xbox controller and play.
883680	886320	There's plenty of games I've wanted to play on the console, but it's just not realistic
886320	888880	to do it.
888880	892200	Especially in my case since I physically have a problem with it.
892200	896820	But I mean, I could have gone out and paid...
896820	902880	For example, I could have bought Mass Effect for $12 or paid $5 like I did for it.
902880	908560	Or $11 for the two games together on Amazon sale and get the collector's edition and play
908560	911280	through all kinds of ways of it.
911280	916500	If I wanted to play Sonic CD, yeah, I could go with all the trouble and hook up my Sega
916500	917500	CD.
917500	922360	Or I could play it on Steam where I bought it and play a much better version with the
922360	923840	good music.
923840	925360	Bobby?
925360	929880	Let me go down this path then because we could probably have this debate all night, but there's
929880	932520	other stuff we want to cover.
932520	937120	Five million dollars has been raised in a week, less than a week.
937120	940320	You can't deny that's a huge deal.
940320	943180	Whether you support it or not, that's a huge deal.
943180	948900	My question is, what is the possible, if any, long-term impact on the next gaming cycle?
948900	954960	Do you think Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo is looking at this going, huh?
954960	958240	Or do you think, eh, don't care, we could step on these guys?
958240	960800	They're looking at it going, no one care.
960800	963520	I don't think they care at all.
963520	964520	Interesting.
964520	966560	But, here's the thing though.
966560	971660	If you, this does become popular, because I mean, I'm not going to say 50,000 consoles
971660	977560	or even, I don't even know, 80,000 consoles, it's not necessarily going to be a big splash.
977560	980920	I mean, it's good for what it is.
980920	984400	But let's say it gives developers an alternative.
984400	989040	They can say, you know what, I don't want to try to get my stuff on Xbox Live Arcade.
989040	993440	I don't want to try to get myself, you know, on the WiiWare service or whatever they're
993440	995320	calling it for the Wii U.
995320	1000000	I don't want to try to, you know, have to negotiate these really crazy deals or, you
1000000	1003200	know, even licensing with these publishers because they're going to try to have too much
1003200	1007300	creative control or, you know, whatever.
1007300	1012200	I'm just going to put my stuff out on Android and then I'm also going to cater it to this
1012200	1016160	console so I can get my game on a console.
1016160	1019520	And yeah, you can do it with Xbox indie games and stuff like that and I really wish there
1019520	1022540	was more services like that because that would be awesome.
1022540	1027360	But there's not, so, you know, kind of have to, you know, that's why you have all these
1027360	1031760	companies going and saying, hey, fuck this, we're going to Kickstarter, we're going to,
1031760	1036520	we want to make this game genre, you know, that is not popular with publishers.
1036520	1039480	That's why you see some of these games going to Kickstarter.
1039480	1045260	I do think the success this thing is seeing so far without there even being a product
1045260	1052280	to touch is obviously people are very into the dream of what they can do with this console.
1052280	1058600	And for me, it's a very loud statement against some of the things we've heard about the next
1058600	1064360	series of consoles, such as you won't be able to play used games, it'll be digital only.
1064360	1067660	You know, whether these facts are true or not, there are things that have been kicked
1067660	1073720	around there in the internet about these next rounds of consoles and have caused a lot of
1073720	1074960	reaction.
1074960	1078840	And you know what we always say, if you want to make the biggest statement possible, vote
1078840	1079840	with your wallet.
1079840	1087220	Well, in a way, now that we have this console out that is basically saying, we are the antithesis,
1087220	1093280	we don't even exist, but we are promising that we will not be that console you all are
1093280	1100040	dreading in the future, and they've raised $5 million like that, that's a big statement
1100040	1103640	to me from the internet.
1103640	1107900	And that's the only thing I think I would be worried about if I was Nintendo, Sony,
1107900	1112840	or Xbox is that whether you personally agree with it or not, people are voting with their
1112840	1116000	wallets right now.
1116000	1122480	Now, granted $5 million is probably a kick in the bucket with Microsoft, but still, here's
1122480	1127360	the other thing too, I mean, I completely forgot, you know, didn't even consider this,
1127360	1132520	Game Guru brings up, what if Google released a $99 Android console, especially if this
1132520	1136680	does well, can you imagine the power of Google saying, hey, you know what, we're going to
1136680	1140360	take that cool little tablet that we made and we're going to just put it into a console.
1140360	1143800	Well, technically, I mean, they did, they created that stupid sphere looking thing that
1143800	1147560	you can now get, but that's $300, you know, for streaming content.
1147560	1151800	But what if they were to do something similar to that, saying, hey, now you can game on
1151800	1157640	your couch, you can, you know, you can game with this console, you can, you know, Facebook,
1157640	1163600	all the stuff that you can do with like WebTV, all in this wonderful console that's low price
1163600	1169040	and you get access to the Android marketplace and that kind of stuff.
1169040	1174960	Alright, going to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com, Brakeman says, Microsoft is looking at the
1174960	1178920	Ouya and thinking about running a company contest to see who can make the most fun of
1178920	1180280	it.
1180280	1184840	You know, one thing Microsoft does very well is they take other people's ideas and make
1184840	1187040	them better and then release it.
1187040	1190480	That's, that's one thing Microsoft's been doing for quite a while.
1190480	1195360	And some might debate me on that point, but that's another thing I think Microsoft would
1195360	1198160	be looking at this going, hmm.
1198160	1203320	But I mean, the whole free to play model, if I understand correctly, it's no different
1203320	1206240	from Xbox Live's model right now.
1206240	1209800	It's not necessarily that all games are free to play forever.
1209800	1215380	It's just that all games have to have a free to play download that you can unlock all levels
1215380	1217960	for five bucks or whatever they go with it.
1217960	1219520	Well, here's the thing too.
1219520	1223840	You know, on Kotaku this week, they've been having their little discussions about the
1223840	1225800	Ouya and that kind of stuff.
1225800	1230280	It's seriously, it's just every single one is just talking people, trying to talk people
1230280	1233640	out of buying one or backing it or something like that.
1233640	1238680	And one of their concerns was piracy, which yes, piracy does exist.
1238680	1241440	Probably quite prevalent on the Android marketplace.
1241440	1246720	Has that stopped games from doing well on, you know, Android?
1246720	1247720	No.
1247720	1252280	And then also the way they're kind of doing these games right now is, you know, they make
1252280	1255180	it a little bit harder to just simply pirate something.
1255180	1258020	They have, you know, the in app purchases.
1258020	1262320	So basically you have to download this free to play version and then you unlock it within
1262320	1263320	the app.
1263320	1267920	So that would be a little bit harder to crack than just say, you know, I'm gonna buy this
1267920	1273400	$5 game and here's the full version, you know, APK file or something like that for it.
1273400	1276600	So there's that, I guess.
1276600	1278080	That's a little bit helpful.
1278080	1280160	All right.
1280160	1283760	There was another comment that was made early on that I thought was pretty accurate.
1283760	1288640	Brakeman also said this at live.vognetware.com, when Loki's son reaches eight, he will be
1288640	1292600	the coolest kid in the neighborhood because his dad will have the coolest shit.
1292600	1297840	You basically said you're buying this to entertain your son with in a large way, kind of.
1297840	1301080	Myself really.
1301080	1303680	But if it helps to watch the kid too, then hey, right?
1303680	1311560	Well yeah, I mean, cause you know, he likes his Caillou, his Canadian children's television.
1311560	1316680	I wasn't sure if I wanted to go here with this other, I mean, it's not in tonight's
1316680	1322160	show role, but it's another Kickstarter and this one, this one's a tricky one.
1322160	1323160	You know what's funny?
1323160	1326720	I got a text message this week and I forgot to reply to it cause I received it while I
1326720	1327720	was dead asleep.
1327720	1328720	I should probably reply to it now.
1328720	1329720	It's been three days later.
1329720	1335600	But one of my friends texted me saying, hey, what's OLR's aversion to crowdsourced funding?
1335600	1339080	OMG, hope I'm not waking you up, although they did wake me up and I forgot to reply
1339080	1340080	because of it.
1340080	1341720	But what is the aversion to crowdsource funding?
1341720	1346320	I don't necessarily have an aversion to crowdsource funding, but I just, there's a lot of things
1346320	1349600	that make me very nervous about Kickstarter.
1349600	1356080	And I think is that A, Kickstarter pockets a large chunk of change from, I mean, 5% out
1356080	1358640	of 5 million is a large chunk of change.
1358640	1363760	But let's be honest here, it's not any different than doing PayPal donations, PayPal pockets
1363760	1365120	a large chunk of that too.
1365120	1370900	I'm not sure everybody, well, let me, let me simplify it this way.
1370900	1377120	An artist once said around 1996, Mo money, Mo problems.
1377120	1381120	And I think that's what a lot of people get into is they don't, you know, they're, they're
1381120	1384520	asking for this money, but I think sometimes not everybody necessarily knows how to spend
1384520	1385520	that money.
1385520	1387200	They think they know how to spend it.
1387200	1392400	But then a lot of these Kickstarters are making way over the amount that they're asking for.
1392400	1394440	And I'm not sure people know what to do with that money.
1394440	1397960	Like one of Kickstarter's biggest problems is they need to have a place where you actually
1397960	1399340	stop making money.
1399340	1403600	Like they need to, maybe this is built in, I've just never seen it.
1403600	1404600	No, they don't have that.
1404600	1406120	They have stretch goals.
1406120	1407360	That's weird to me.
1407360	1409360	And of course, why would Kickstarter want to put that in?
1409360	1412160	If you're making a runaway money, they're getting 5% of it all.
1412160	1414520	They want you to make millions.
1414520	1419760	But you know, I expressed vocal descent one time and I hate doing this because it was
1419760	1425840	another podcast, but I have to openly ask, why does a podcast need to raise?
1425840	1427160	What the hell were they asking for?
1427160	1429880	They in all, they had raised six digits.
1429880	1434160	This podcast raised something like $180,000 and I don't have it in front of me.
1434160	1436200	I'll look it up in a minute here.
1436200	1440960	And they had said it was because they had a, they were going to have a studio space
1440960	1448380	and all this stuff that they need to revive their podcast, which was how many episodes
1448380	1449380	before that?
1449380	1450920	I think it was like maybe a year.
1450920	1451920	Yeah.
1451920	1455120	And I personally found that to be insulting as a podcaster.
1455120	1460820	I found it to be insulting that if you want to podcast, you need money to do it.
1460820	1464840	That much money anyway, because you really don't.
1464840	1466080	You need a little money.
1466080	1467080	Sure.
1467080	1471000	If you want to make the reunion happen, you just fucking do it.
1471000	1475080	You don't force people to pay $100,000 to have it done.
1475080	1476080	That's insulting.
1476080	1481600	A perfect example of a podcast raising money, um, for a legitimate purpose.
1481600	1485040	There was this, um, it was a mom gamers podcast.
1485040	1490280	They wanted to raise $500 for new mics and better equipment so they could do their podcast.
1490280	1491280	That was it.
1491280	1494760	And of course they raised it pretty quick because it's only $500 and that's all they
1494760	1499200	were asking for because that's what you need to run a podcast.
1499200	1506400	You just, you know, just the necessities, mics and you know, recording equipment.
1506400	1512040	This podcast raised over $130,000 and they were asking for $30,000.
1512040	1520200	They needed $30,000 to do a podcast and I kind of thought that was horseshit, sorry.
1520200	1524560	That was, I want this to be a paying job, but people bought into it.
1524560	1526800	I guess the quality of the show is good enough.
1526800	1530480	People are that attached to it or people paid five times over.
1530480	1532160	So hats off.
1532160	1533160	Congrats.
1533160	1534160	You made it work.
1534160	1535160	You found the answer.
1535160	1536160	How to make money off podcasting.
1536160	1537160	Congrats.
1537160	1540200	I hope the profit was worth it.
1540200	1545160	I want to make very clear, very clear, explicitly clear.
1545160	1550120	I am not talking about the all games Kickstarter because I realized people are thinking, oh,
1550120	1551520	I'm going to go there.
1551520	1553440	All games had a different plan in mind.
1553440	1555680	They wanted to make a full network.
1555680	1561180	Personally, I don't think they needed $45,000, but that's neither here nor there.
1561180	1562280	It's a done deal now.
1562280	1564560	I still would support them in that effort.
1564560	1568160	I understand why they thought big and I can respect that.
1568160	1570760	Dream big or go home, right?
1570760	1572460	That's what they did.
1572460	1574600	My previous rant was not about that.
1574600	1576600	So don't start shit.
1576600	1582480	Anyhow, that wasn't even the thing I wanted to talk about.
1582480	1583480	Damn.
1583480	1584480	Anyways, let's talk about penny.
1584480	1585480	Yes.
1585480	1587560	I want to talk about the penny arcade Kickstarter.
1587560	1592500	You know exactly where I was going with this.
1592500	1597000	So their Kickstarter was to remove advertising off their website to remove ads from their
1597000	1602000	website is, and I'm trying to bring it up right here.
1602000	1606480	Penny arcade wants to raise, and this one was really interesting.
1606480	1613240	They really thought about this because they made the goal $250,000, but that's only to
1613240	1616800	get rid of one ad on the site.
1616800	1621660	If you want to get rid of all the ads, they got to make 999, 9999.
1621660	1623560	It's a million, basically $1 short of a million.
1623560	1633040	If they raise that much on Kickstarter, they're going to do all of penny arcade ad free.
1633040	1636560	There's this interesting angle they're going with it where they don't want to work for
1636560	1637560	advertisers.
1637560	1639720	They want to work for you.
1639720	1640760	I can respect that.
1640760	1644080	It's a different way of thinking.
1644080	1651760	But this is the same group that's brought us penny arcade expo.
1651760	1656840	They brought us the child's play charity, which are two great things.
1656840	1659680	I can't say anything bad about either of those things.
1659680	1664780	Penny arcade expo gave E3 a ran for its money and still is in some regards.
1664780	1667280	That's huge.
1667280	1670040	Child's play, obviously a hugely important, great thing.
1670040	1672320	It's a necessary thing in the gaming industry.
1672320	1673320	They brought us that.
1673320	1675080	So these are two great things.
1675080	1679400	But then I kind of go, well, penny arcade with all this stuff that they built isn't
1679400	1683080	exactly an indie darling anymore.
1683080	1686760	You know what I mean?
1686760	1691120	And they're asking for money to get rid of ads and one of the things that they're asking
1691120	1697880	for is if you pay us $5,000, you get a play date with penny arcade.
1697880	1701200	In other words, you fly to us for an evening of pizza and games.
1701200	1710320	I'm just kind of like, I get the Kickstarter is not really supposed to be about the rewards,
1710320	1715560	but if you're investing in a website, if you're basically giving them money, what are you
1715560	1718680	really getting in return?
1718680	1721640	And apparently they don't understand Kickstarter is about the rewards.
1721640	1727000	That's kind of why people, people like the preorder bonuses for things.
1727000	1732480	And so that's why they, you know, it's kind of the incentive to get you the back money
1732480	1733800	for these things.
1733800	1739280	And some of them, it's like I remember on the penny arcade one, which someone mentioned
1739280	1743920	kind of border lining on, you know, breaking the terms of surface of Twitter.
1743920	1746120	They said, we will follow you on Twitter.
1746120	1751000	If you pay us this much, we will retweet something that you said.
1751000	1756760	If you pay this much, we're literally, they're going to find your tweet and click a button
1756760	1760600	for like a couple hundred bucks.
1760600	1765520	Ooh, that sounds difficult.
1765520	1770080	And honestly, if they're retweeting something that you said, who gives a shit what you said?
1770080	1773360	I mean, you're gonna say, oh, retweet it from them.
1773360	1774360	Who's this person?
1774360	1775360	I don't know.
1775360	1779480	They're not gonna, someone following penny arcade isn't going to go, oh my God, they
1779480	1780480	retweeted this person.
1780480	1783080	I need to follow them, become best friends with them.
1783080	1784520	No one gives a shit.
1784520	1789480	RDG cinch in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm under the impression
1789480	1791240	that penny arcade was already profitable.
1791240	1792240	I'm sure it is.
1792240	1796200	But what they want to do, they want to take out the ads and have the people pay for it
1796200	1798700	because they want to be a business that's run by the people.
1798700	1801700	And I get that on paper, that sounds like a great idea.
1801700	1806320	And maybe the answer for why would you give $5,000 is, well, it's about supporting the
1806320	1812680	community and it's about supporting this, not just comic strip, but organization that
1812680	1814680	I really like.
1814680	1818340	But I'm like, well, can't you support them through ads too?
1818340	1822400	If you support the website, click on the ads, check out the sponsors.
1822400	1823400	That's another way to do it.
1823400	1824400	That'll make a money too.
1824400	1825800	Or advertise on their site.
1825800	1830800	But penny arcade wants to, that's a conscious decision on their part.
1830800	1834080	They want to not have that be the way people support them anymore.
1834080	1837400	They want to cut out the middleman.
1837400	1839320	It's interesting.
1839320	1840320	I don't know.
1840320	1841440	I don't know what to think about it.
1841440	1846560	I'm not exactly going to donate, but I think it's interesting.
1846560	1848560	I will continue to donate to Child's Play.
1848560	1851560	I will continue to support the Child's Play events.
1851560	1854640	I will continue to attend Penny Arcade Expo when I can.
1854640	1857640	I'll continue to read the website and click on an ad when it looks interesting.
1857640	1864400	But Kickstarter, not my thing, but that's just me.
1864400	1867400	City Vampire says, why donate money to remove ads?
1867400	1870520	Something gaming related would be much more preferable.
1870520	1875960	If they'd done this, because wasn't that Penny Arcade volume three in trouble for a long
1875960	1879520	time and it looked like it took them a long time to find a person that would actually
1879520	1881920	make it because the first two didn't do so hot or something like that.
1881920	1885320	I don't want to make stuff up, but I know the third game took a long time and it came
1885320	1887440	from somebody else and it has kind of a different look to it.
1887440	1888920	And is way better.
1888920	1894640	Why didn't they just fund a potential Penny Arcade 4 or whatever or Penny Arcade other
1894640	1896840	thing through this?
1896840	1897840	It's interesting.
1897840	1902400	Or better yet, they have a card game coming out that's based on one of their comics as
1902400	1907160	well in Kickstarter, but it's some other company putting it out that licensed it from Penny
1907160	1908160	Arcade.
1908160	1912560	I'm not sure Penny Arcade's making, I'm sure they're making some money off of it.
1912560	1914360	I don't know.
1914360	1918240	I think a lot of the stuff that they do, I mean, they sell merchandise.
1918240	1924800	They sell stuff to help fund their organization and I know now that they're a lot bigger than
1924800	1925800	they used to be.
1925800	1931920	They have their own offices, obviously they can run these conventions, which I'm sure
1931920	1935440	are pretty expensive, but I'm sure they're making money off of them as well.
1935440	1937480	Otherwise they...
1937480	1941980	I mean, I'm not going to say that they're not going to run them because they're not
1941980	1944560	profitable, but they're not going to keep...
1944560	1948040	They wouldn't be expanding if they weren't profitable.
1948040	1951180	You know what else is weird about this whole Kickstarter is that they have these stretch
1951180	1956000	goals that are at 1.1 million and 1.3 million and 1.4 million and they're locked.
1956000	1957000	They're a mystery.
1957000	1958000	It's a secret to everyone.
1958000	1960600	You don't get to know what they are until they hit those goals and I'm kind of like,
1960600	1966640	in what investment world do you get to keep these kinds of secrets?
1966640	1972840	Like if this was a, you know, non-Kickstarter investment in the real world type of thing,
1972840	1976880	I think there's like laws and stuff that prevent these kinds of secrets.
1976880	1979720	You have to disclose these things.
1979720	1980720	It's weird to me.
1980720	1983240	It's a different way of thinking.
1983240	1984240	I don't know.
1984240	1985240	Anyhow.
1985240	1986240	All right.
1986240	1987840	I'm done talking about Kickstarters and all that.
1987840	1992920	It was a big intro to the show, but it's really a huge part of what's going on in the gaming
1992920	1994240	world this week.
1994240	1995240	So it keeps going.
1995240	1998400	We missed the Mac versus PC debate in the chat room.
1998400	1999400	Really?
1999400	2000400	Still?
2000400	2001400	Yeah.
2001400	2002400	Well, no.
2002400	2003400	It's over.
2003400	2004400	It's just, you know what?
2004400	2010120	The biggest people who don't, who are all anti-Apple are not graphic designers.
2010120	2014000	Thank you Game Guru for filling in the gap that made me look ignorant there.
2014000	2018960	Penny Arcade 3 is being made by the Breath of Death 7 and Cthulhu Saves the World people.
2018960	2022400	Not exactly a big budget, but actually a good fit.
2022400	2023400	Thank you.
2023400	2024400	I could actually totally see that.
2024400	2026720	It's very much like the old school Final Fantasy games.
2026720	2027720	That's awesome.
2027720	2030160	It's actually already out on Xbox Live indie games, so go check it out.
2030160	2034200	I mean, it's, I kind of wanted to check it out because I like those type of games.
2034200	2036240	Not because I'm necessarily a Penny Arcade fan.
2036240	2039800	I mean, I don't like their comics, but I don't read them every week.
2039800	2040800	Right.
2040800	2041800	All right.
2041800	2045680	Well, anyhow, let's get on into how we're supposed to start the show off here.
2045680	2047160	You know, 30 minutes into it.
2047160	2048500	How was your gaming week?
2048500	2050480	What types of video games you've been playing this week?
2050480	2053960	And then we'll get into some housekeeping and then the rest of the gaming news we have
2053960	2054960	tonight.
2054960	2055960	Let's start off though.
2055960	2056960	First, what have you been playing this week?
2056960	2057960	Dark Sakura.
2057960	2058960	Mass Effect.
2058960	2059960	Still?
2059960	2063200	Even though you, oh wait, no, you weren't here to tell us about how you...
2063200	2064920	I beat it on Tuesday.
2064920	2067240	Then I played WoW for like an hour.
2067240	2072640	Then I went back and started modding my save file and figured out how to use the, because
2072640	2079000	the big thing for 3 is that they, they had a default feme shot with all the special textures
2079000	2081960	and everything like the dude one had, which is about damn time, except her face looked
2081960	2083300	like a brick.
2083300	2088400	But the textures were really good, except she also looked over at me like a cheap hooker.
2088400	2093260	But I did figure out how to make my own face shape and everything so that she's, you know,
2093260	2098760	basically doesn't have a head the shape of a brick and applied the textures to it.
2098760	2102000	And then custom hairs that other characters in the game have.
2102000	2106360	I also found out how to make Ashley's hair work on her, but her hair is like a shoulder
2106360	2107960	item for armor.
2107960	2112840	I also found the, and I've got to do a few tweaks to get it to work, I found how to use
2112840	2119280	the hooker outfit, like the dancer outfits from Afterlife.
2119280	2122760	So it's actually one of the underwears.
2122760	2125200	So when you said you beat Mass Effect, you're talking about Mass Effect 3?
2125200	2126200	Yes.
2126200	2127520	Well I beat Mass Effect 2 the week before.
2127520	2131240	Like me, you've now played the whole series this year, beaten all three games, da da da
2131240	2132240	da da.
2132240	2133240	In a month.
2133240	2134240	And now you're into modding them.
2134240	2135240	Yes.
2135240	2136240	Kind of your thing.
2136240	2137560	Because I'm going to keep, I'm going to play it as a paragon.
2137560	2140620	I don't really give a shit about playing Bit Shepherd.
2140620	2142560	And I don't give a shit about playing as a dude either.
2142560	2146120	I'm going to keep playing, I've done a few renegade options just in the curiosity.
2146120	2148920	You are in the fem-shep-is-the-only-shep camp.
2148920	2150920	Yeah, I guess.
2150920	2156760	And you know, because I have this headcanon, the term I've kept using over and over, I
2156760	2159560	have a headcanon and I'm sticking to it.
2159560	2162580	So without spoiling, that ending.
2162580	2167140	Now you are in a unique situation where, you know, we're starting to hear people now that
2167140	2168720	are getting into the series.
2168720	2170120	You never saw the original ending.
2170120	2171380	You only saw extended cut.
2171380	2172840	I saw part of the original ending.
2172840	2174800	And I did go back and watch it.
2174800	2179260	But yeah, my official first ending was extended cut.
2179260	2180560	And I wasn't disappointed.
2180560	2182000	It was just fine.
2182000	2184360	I think it cleared a lot of stuff up.
2184360	2187200	I think it had a definite resolution.
2187200	2188660	And I'm happy with it.
2188660	2192040	You know, I went back and watched some of the other ones online.
2192040	2194800	You know, the one I picked was the Destroy ending.
2194800	2198080	Except when I accidentally shot the stupid kid in the head.
2198080	2201920	But then my game froze and I got to start over from the decision.
2201920	2205200	The other thing I found out, by the way, with the save file editor, is that you can save
2205200	2208320	your autosave files as standard save files.
2208320	2210200	So where it loads as your autosave.
2210200	2213980	Like say that you were at that last decision and you wanted to just to keep going back
2213980	2217000	to that point, even though it's not like a standard save.
2217000	2223980	You can close the game at that point, pull up the gibbed editor, and load your autosave
2223980	2225840	and save it as a separate save file.
2225840	2228400	So you can always go back to that point in the game.
2228400	2229400	Pretty cool, huh?
2229400	2230400	Yeah, that's interesting.
2230400	2233840	Of course, when I did it, it was on 360 where you don't get to do any of that.
2233840	2237320	Also, gibbed editor works for 360.
2237320	2240920	You can import your files from your 360 if you're saving on the hard drive.
2240920	2246200	Run them through gibbed editor because it's high, it's PC stuff.
2246200	2249920	And even do custom hairs, custom textures, all that same type of stuff.
2249920	2254020	You can, well you can't load the outside mods, but you can do all the stuff that's hidden
2254020	2255020	in the game.
2255020	2257680	You haven't even changed your coalesce bin.
2257680	2259940	You can hack it, pretty much.
2259940	2261520	So what now, now that Mass Effect's done?
2261520	2263200	I mean, I know you want to do some...
2263200	2264920	Playing through Mass Effect 3 again.
2264920	2270120	You want to do some fan things, but are there any other series that you've overlooked that
2270120	2272480	now you're thinking, hmm, maybe I should go back and revisit them?
2272480	2273480	Not really.
2273480	2277200	I mean, well, and keep in mind, I actually have beaten four games this year, because
2277200	2280880	I beat Portal 2 again a couple of times.
2280880	2283320	And still playing through Fractal.
2283320	2287640	And then I've decided that I'm interested in WoW a bit again because of the goat mount.
2287640	2293440	I want a riding goat and they better have rectangular pupils because goats are the best.
2293440	2299400	I was on Girls Gone WoW today for their recording and we went long.
2299400	2301880	It was, it was a good show.
2301880	2302880	Awesome.
2302880	2303880	GirlsGoneWow.net.
2303880	2304880	You can hear that Wednesdays.
2304880	2305880	Says hi.
2305880	2306880	Hello.
2306880	2307880	Hello.
2307880	2313640	We went over a lot of the, what we think of the new mounts and I think we had a general
2313640	2315320	consensus that some of us like it.
2315320	2316320	Some of us don't.
2316320	2318320	How's that for consensus?
2318320	2319440	Of course.
2319440	2320680	Everyone's entitled to like or not like.
2320680	2323360	I'm sure you guys had to talk about the pet battling a little bit.
2323360	2324360	Pokemon.
2324360	2325360	Yeah.
2325360	2326360	Straight up Pokemon.
2326360	2327920	But you have to name each of your pets and how is that going to work?
2327920	2328920	You don't have to.
2328920	2329920	Well, I'm gonna.
2329920	2333240	I'm going to name them all after Supernatural.
2333240	2334240	Just Google cute pet names.
2334240	2336440	I'll have Sam as a pet.
2336440	2342400	You know, um, but I really, I mean really, except for my hour of wow, hour of wower,
2342400	2345760	I've been playing Mass Effect and I'm going to keep playing Mass Effect.
2345760	2351960	It's super fun and I still have a hundred percent galactic readiness on my damn phone
2351960	2359220	and my next goal is to figure out how to get Ashley's face texture to work over the shepherd
2359220	2364880	that I have without doing this really weird thing where it scrolls your camera out and
2364880	2367160	clips through everything else.
2367160	2372320	Like it did however show me exactly how some of the levels were laid out as far as their
2372320	2373320	rendered space.
2373320	2374320	So that was kind of neat.
2374320	2376840	And at some point you do really have to check out the multiplayer with friends.
2376840	2377840	I probably will.
2377840	2382360	I just have to make sure that my coalesced bin is fine, but the only thing that I did
2382360	2387600	on that really was set some key binds for weapons, which I'm probably going to undo
2387600	2392660	and I play, I have my game hacked for god mode if I wanted it.
2392660	2397360	So I don't really need any of that except for the one where you use no fuel.
2397360	2402000	I have the things set where your fuel is a hundred, I mean not at a hundred, but you
2402000	2408480	use zero and the Reapers don't find you as easily, that type of thing.
2408480	2410520	All right, let's move on.
2410520	2411680	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2411680	2413040	I didn't play a lot.
2413040	2417080	It's basically just Minecraft this week again.
2417080	2420260	I like the new update.
2420260	2429320	It's very fun and so I haven't gotten to make any pistons yet, but you know, I'll get there.
2429320	2436040	I did, was it, I also like the new lighting engines, a little interesting, I guess it's
2436040	2438280	supposed to be more like PC.
2438280	2442840	And finally did start a new world as well with my coworker because we kind of got tired
2442840	2451200	of playing just in mine and so we did start a new one and playing that on regular again
2451200	2455400	with monsters and everything because I've been playing on Peaceful for a long time.
2455400	2464000	I finally finished my mine cart track thing which goes across the entire map now and it
2464000	2465000	makes a full circuit.
2465000	2474040	In fact, last night I was working on creating the redstone circuits for each stop.
2474040	2477680	It's gonna have like a delay on it so the cart gets to the stop.
2477680	2482640	There's about a 10 second delay where the cart stays there and then the cart automatically
2482640	2489340	moves to the next stop so it's kind of a, you know, little bit of a, you know, subway
2489340	2498280	type thing and it's gonna make a little ding-dong when it gets to the stop so it's kind of cool.
2498280	2503160	And then Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, I've been playing that a little bit, changing up
2503160	2508560	my custom classes to get ready for the tournament that I'll be playing in a couple weeks here
2508560	2509560	which I'm very psyched about.
2509560	2510760	And you did find a partner for that.
2510760	2518160	I did find a partner, one of my friends, his brother plays a ton of Call of Duty so he's
2518160	2524960	gonna be going down with me to the the armpit of California, Stockton.
2524960	2528480	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Bakersfield.
2528480	2529960	You're not going to Bakersfield.
2529960	2530960	Sorry.
2530960	2534800	What would Stockton be then?
2534800	2536620	Stockton is kind of like...
2536620	2537880	It's that part behind the knee.
2537880	2540440	It's the mole on your butt.
2540440	2542680	Not everybody has moles, Rob.
2542680	2544080	Okay, how about...
2544080	2545320	California has one and it's called Stockton.
2545320	2549360	How about the belly button, because the belly button gets kind of stinky.
2549360	2553000	It's the bankrupt part of the body, actually, is what it is.
2553000	2557360	So we're going with Stockton in a couple weeks.
2557360	2561460	But yeah, he's totally psyched to go and play and apparently he's really good with the pistols,
2561460	2563460	so that's awesome.
2563460	2566680	Still trying to figure out what sidearm I'm supposed to use because honestly I play a
2566680	2571400	lot with just launchers and explosives because I have my primary weapon that I use for everything
2571400	2576480	and launchers just take out helicopters and you know, maybe I call it my sniper rifle
2576480	2578680	sometimes because that's why I shoot across the map.
2578680	2582160	Sometimes I hit snipers.
2582160	2588080	So I've never really bothered with a machine pistol or a pistol because I'm like, when
2588080	2589740	the hell am I going to need this?
2589740	2591200	I'm just going to use my regular gun for everything.
2591200	2596320	If I run out of ammo with my regular gun, I'm going to pick up someone else's gun.
2596320	2597320	I don't know.
2597320	2598320	So I still have to figure out what I'm going to do there.
2598320	2602040	I'm going to talk to him because he knows what he's doing.
2602040	2608060	So we got all the rules and everything and it's kind of dumb, some of the restrictions
2608060	2609820	that they have in there.
2609820	2610820	No cheating.
2610820	2611860	No, it's not even cheating.
2611860	2621420	It's like no explosives at all except no C4, no Claymores, no bouncing betties, no launchers,
2621420	2633920	no grenade launcher attachments, there's no recon perk, no sit rep.
2633920	2640720	They're going to leave kill cams on for some reason, which is weird.
2640720	2644240	And then some of the maps that they picked are just really huge for two on two matches.
2644240	2650920	I'm like, hey, you know you guys, why don't you guys download the free face off maps,
2650920	2656000	which they made for two on two matches.
2656000	2661420	Makes sense that you would play on those maps because they're the size for a good two on
2661420	2662420	two tournament.
2662420	2664880	No, we're going to use the really large maps instead.
2664880	2667120	Yeah, that sounds fantastic.
2667120	2671040	I'm glad someone's running this tournament well.
2671040	2676360	But whatever, I will play by their rules, but it's just stupid that they picked these
2676360	2677360	giant maps.
2677360	2682600	This village is terrible for two on two, it's just, okay, I hope I find you because this
2682600	2684800	map is fucking huge.
2684800	2689120	But we'll see, I guess.
2689120	2690680	Anything else for your gaming week?
2690680	2695560	I played a little Grand Theft Auto, but just because I was working on my mod, because I
2695560	2699780	was talking to someone that helped out with their map modding stuff and just talking to
2699780	2703960	about Grand Theft Auto things, I'm like, I kind of want to work on Grand Theft Auto again.
2703960	2706440	And then I made an outhouse and I got bored.
2706440	2709240	So that was that.
2709240	2713560	I do need to finish the map mods I've been working on for almost 18 months now.
2713560	2719320	So I can at least finish them before Grand Theft Auto 5 comes out.
2719320	2720320	That's it.
2720320	2721640	All right.
2721640	2722640	My gaming week.
2722640	2726400	Actually, I didn't play really anything new, but I revisited old stuff.
2726400	2728320	In fact, really old stuff.
2728320	2732720	Because Alan the other day was like, hey, I'm going to hook up the PlayStation 2.
2732720	2736600	And then he didn't actually do it right away, but it had me thinking about PlayStation 2
2736600	2737600	games.
2737600	2738600	I kind of wanted to go back and play.
2738600	2740940	So then the other night I was like, Alan, weren't you going to hook up the PlayStation
2740940	2741940	2?
2741940	2744000	And so he finally found it and hooked it up.
2744000	2746920	And I promptly started playing Final Fantasy 12.
2746920	2747920	I don't know why.
2747920	2750160	I just never really played enough of it before.
2750160	2751560	And I was just like, I don't want to play that again.
2751560	2753840	I think I can blame Theatrhythm for that.
2753840	2756200	Remember how I was talking last week about how it's kind of a commercial for the Final
2756200	2758080	Fantasy games and makes you want to play them again?
2758080	2762200	I think I can thank Theatrhythm for making me go, you know, I didn't play enough of 12.
2762200	2763740	I'm going to go back and play more of that.
2763740	2766440	So I played a little more of that.
2766440	2770720	The other thing I got is that, you know, as we'll get into more of the details on later
2770720	2774680	in the show, but as I'm sure all you guys know about, there's a steam sale going on
2774680	2775680	right now.
2775680	2778200	Oh, yeah.
2778200	2779800	As in, give me all your money right now.
2779800	2781120	I'm pretty broke as it is.
2781120	2782120	Yeah.
2782120	2787360	It's just like, but I need these games that I probably, yeah, I can tell you right now
2787360	2792520	I was looking, actually it's funny what you were talking earlier, I was looking through
2792520	2798640	my steam collection to see, you know, what exactly I have and I can honestly say maybe
2798640	2803960	out of all of these, the steam copies, I may have played Portal 2, but most of these games
2803960	2811760	I have not played yet and I'm just like, but I need more, I need more.
2811760	2812760	That's awesome.
2812760	2817200	I would be tempted to get Borderlands, but first person shooters make me sick and Dan
2817200	2819080	and we already have it on Xbox.
2819080	2820080	Right.
2820080	2825120	Well, the platform thing didn't stop me because when Skyrim got discounted to 29 bucks, I
2825120	2827040	was like, I want it on PC.
2827040	2830200	So the mods are really cool that I've been waiting to get it for the mod.
2830200	2831200	That's what sold me on it.
2831200	2834880	To be honest is that I've watched Alan mod the shit out of his game and I was like, you
2834880	2835880	know what?
2835880	2836880	I want it.
2836880	2840440	So I bought it and I got to say, especially because now when you download it, you can
2840440	2843880	get the higher resolution texture pack is like DLC right away.
2843880	2849760	My PC, my PC, well, this laptop is so pretty.
2849760	2854840	I need to upgrade my PC and it's really pissing me off because it's going to be expensive
2854840	2855840	to do that.
2855840	2860480	And I don't ever use my PC anymore, but that PC was meant for like games like grant.
2860480	2862080	Well, it was meant for crisis.
2862080	2868980	And now of course it's way outdated because it has old 8,800 G no Nvidia cards in it.
2868980	2873040	But this laptop, I think if I ran Skyrim on it, I think it would literally melt.
2873040	2877040	Like I was running grant the thought of the other day and got up to 86 degrees Celsius
2877040	2878380	on the GPU.
2878380	2883700	I can, I almost boil water with my hand above the, the actual keyword.
2883700	2887600	Like it wasn't even touching the monitor and it was too hot for my hand to stay there.
2887600	2891520	So and I have this thing modded for cooling too.
2891520	2893200	So I don't know what I'm going to do.
2893200	2896480	And I all of a sudden, now I'm on this new mission is I really want to get back into
2896480	2900000	civilization five because I need to get the gods and Kings expansion when it gets discounted
2900000	2901000	again.
2901000	2903760	And it was only $8 on steam the other night.
2903760	2906680	So I'm convinced before the 23rd, it'll be on sale again.
2906680	2909120	And I'm going to buy Alan a copy and make him play with me.
2909120	2916360	But yeah, seriously, anybody that has Borderlands add me on steam because I don't have anybody
2916360	2917400	added at all.
2917400	2922460	We do have a vog network group on steam where you should, I can find, I'm thinking we need
2922460	2926280	the work on getting some Borderlands games night going because I'm picking up Borderlands
2926280	2932080	two when that comes out, probably not for PC, but on X-Box three 60 because Borderlands
2932080	2933240	is just an awesome game.
2933240	2934400	I do want to go back to it.
2934400	2940800	I, I'll be playing on an X-Box again, but my, my coworker won't return my copy.
2940800	2943880	So I'm just like, eh, fine.
2943880	2944880	All right.
2944880	2948320	Um, let's get into some announcements then we can get into the rest of the gaming news.
2948320	2949320	Um, announcements.
2949320	2950400	I have a few tonight.
2950400	2953240	First off the voice of geeks network at vog network.com.
2953240	2959240	I'd like to welcome critical myth and British in British invaders, almost a British invasion,
2959240	2962200	which it is kind of an invasion, but it is the British invaders.
2962200	2965140	We want to welcome both those shows to the lineup.
2965140	2966840	Both those shows are going to be airing Monday.
2966840	2969600	Critical myth is actually three times a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
2969600	2973840	So both those shows, uh, announced earlier tonight, joining the network, if you want
2973840	2977420	the full announcement, Bobby will append it to his podcast this week.
2977420	2980860	So that'll be posted in the next couple of days, but we want to welcome them to the network.
2980860	2983320	They both start tomorrow.
2983320	2987760	Um, also, um, feedback about the checking into the podcast.
2987760	2991080	A lot of folks miss the check-in word last week.
2991080	2995640	So Bobby and I kind of sat down and talked and we now have a little chime noise that
2995640	2998560	you're going to hear before the word is given.
2998560	3001280	So that way, those of you guys that are kind of zoning as you're working and you miss the
3001280	3005200	check-in word, you have something to kind of snap out of it and Oh, pay attention.
3005200	3008660	So, uh, just throwing that out there, you will now hear a little chime noise before
3008660	3009660	the check-in word.
3009660	3010960	All right.
3010960	3014640	Did I hear Jamie's buying Borderlands over there?
3014640	3015640	Yes.
3015640	3016640	Good job.
3016640	3023080	I want to see Gabe Newell is sitting in an evil layer somewhere going, yes, excellent.
3023080	3026520	Someone needs to buy me Saints for the third.
3026520	3027520	How about that?
3027520	3032920	I want to say, um, I think, I can't remember if Borderlands had a third person view or
3032920	3033920	not in it.
3033920	3039560	I want to say, did I saw maybe, I think there's a way to hack it on PC where
3039560	3043360	you run third person, which if that, if you can then cause you can do it in portal two,
3043360	3044520	you can play portal two third person.
3044520	3045520	Yeah.
3045520	3046520	All right.
3046520	3049720	The one other announcement I have is that we will be participating in PlayStation home
3049720	3053040	summer Fest to the VOG network is participating in that.
3053040	3054680	Be ready on the 29th.
3054680	3055960	That's in two weeks.
3055960	3059800	We are going to be broadcasting in PlayStation home.
3059800	3061560	Now I want to make this clear though.
3061560	3062920	Nothing is like changing.
3062920	3066360	You still go to VOG network and you can, you know, hear our show and everything and the
3066360	3067480	podcast is still there.
3067480	3069280	Like always that part's not changing.
3069280	3073360	But as we've done on a few nights, we're going to have home open as well.
3073360	3076000	We'll be in PlayStation home fielding questions and so forth.
3076000	3077840	This isn't just the clubhouse though.
3077840	3081820	This is actually, we're going to be out in one of the spaces called Aurora 1.5, which
3081820	3088680	is kind of a trippy little like, uh, like flashy colors, tunnels that whisk you to places
3088680	3090840	and things, mini games, lots of unlocks.
3090840	3091840	It's a fun little world.
3091840	3095240	I was in there earlier, so we're going to be in the Aurora space starting at five Pacific
3095240	3101120	when Bobby's on, uh, a Eastern on the 29th, where the last event for PlayStation summer
3101120	3105480	Fest, where they're really excited to have us, we're really excited to be a part of it.
3105480	3109940	I do want to point out, it's not an official Sony home acknowledged thing, but we're hoping
3109940	3112000	to make enough rabble that they'll notice.
3112000	3113840	So we're going to flip some chairs over in Aurora.
3113840	3115120	It'll be fun.
3115120	3117560	It's just, listen, listen, running man.
3117560	3120440	Listen, if you're going to flip chairs over, nobody's going to notice.
3120440	3122840	It's all about tables, tables, tables, tables.
3122840	3125520	Sorry, it's all about flipping tables now.
3125520	3131120	So plan on joining us on the 29th steam needs to be on Linux.
3131120	3134680	I thought they did have some type of Linux support or something.
3134680	3136000	If they do, I haven't found it.
3136000	3137000	I could be wrong.
3137000	3138000	All right.
3138000	3139000	We got to get into gaming news.
3139000	3140800	We're like, we're talking a lot tonight.
3140800	3141800	Sorry.
3141800	3142800	Let's get into gaming news.
3142800	3143800	Loki.
3143800	3144800	Okay.
3144800	3146400	So Amazon has a brand new service that they've announced.
3146400	3154160	It's basically a free-to-play game service called Game Connect, and it's not necessarily
3154160	3158960	the same service that they announced for Kindle, which was Game Circle, but Game Connect, they're
3158960	3163680	going to have basically a way to discover new free-to-play games and MMOs and that kind
3163680	3164920	of stuff.
3164920	3168800	And you can check it out over at Amazon.
3168800	3169800	Let's see here.
3169800	3171880	I'm sure they've got a link on the front page to do that stuff.
3171880	3174600	Let's see what kind of games they've got here.
3174600	3179000	World of Tanks, I mean, you can't hate a world full of tanks.
3179000	3184880	Shimagami Tensei, that's pretty cool.
3184880	3188200	A lot of interesting-looking MMOs.
3188200	3192360	8-bit MMO, kind of looks a little bit like Minecraft.
3192360	3195960	You can build anything they say in there.
3195960	3200720	RuneScape, let's see here.
3200720	3203560	A bunch of games.
3203560	3206520	So definitely go check it out.
3206520	3211540	And I wonder if they're going to have some more stuff included with that.
3211540	3217120	They're saying that some of the launch titles, Battlestar Galactica, World of Tanks, Pandora's
3217120	3222840	Saga, Stronghold Kingdoms, and Super Monday Night Combat.
3222840	3225840	So why does Amazon want to jump into this?
3225840	3229840	I guess Amazon likes to kind of get their hands on everything.
3229840	3230840	Exactly.
3230840	3241040	They want to maybe get in on some of that in-game content.
3241040	3245980	Maybe they'll tie it in with the Kindle or something like that.
3245980	3251380	Maybe they can find a way to get some of these games to run on that platform.
3251380	3255600	I don't know, I think just to get more hits on their site for whatever reason.
3255600	3259960	So people think of Amazon as the place to go for everything.
3259960	3261760	I guess it seems like a good tactic.
3261760	3267000	But do you think people will care?
3267000	3268000	I don't know.
3268000	3270300	I don't know if they are necessarily going to care.
3270300	3276320	It's kind of like, I don't think these places are the only places you can go to play these
3276320	3277320	games.
3277320	3280280	So if you're playing them already, it's not like you're going to go, okay, I'm going to
3280280	3284720	all of a sudden go to Amazon.
3284720	3288920	It's definitely a way for maybe some of these companies that are putting out free-to-play
3288920	3294000	stuff because the free-to-play market is quite crowded to get some exposure maybe.
3294000	3299060	So it's like, hey, I saw your game on Amazon, I'm going to check it out.
3299060	3302020	Amazon hasn't been popular with every part of the gaming community though.
3302020	3306400	Some say that Amazon kind of rips them off because the whole like, you know, they have
3306400	3311480	the right to price match whatever you do other places and kind of all this stuff.
3311480	3315920	And some developers had their game put up for free for too long on there.
3315920	3319240	You know, I just remember hearing stories in the past about how not everybody's thrilled
3319240	3321480	with Amazon.
3321480	3323740	You kind of need them.
3323740	3329920	The developers that is to, well, we'll see what comes of that.
3329920	3332120	Although no Amazon console yet, right?
3332120	3333120	That's the last thing we need right now.
3333120	3334120	It's just a console.
3334120	3337600	But if you want to check them out, it's amazon.com slash free.
3337600	3340920	The number two play.
3340920	3345840	Did I just see in chat that DJ Morpheus from understation live also just bought borderlands.
3345840	3353200	That is 750 for the game of the urgent.
3353200	3355200	That is well satiated.
3355200	3357840	I'm just saying borderlands was a great game to begin with.
3357840	3363640	And they, that was a game that they knew how to do DLC and their DLC was pretty awesome.
3363640	3365400	So game of the year edition.
3365400	3368720	And if you're too cheap for the game of the year edition, they have a regular version
3368720	3369720	for five bucks.
3369720	3373240	I just don't want to hunt around for skulls.
3373240	3374240	It's all about loot.
3374240	3377720	I mean, seriously, if you like playing the vog game and stuff and collecting loot, this
3377720	3380320	game is just like shiny gun drops.
3380320	3381840	Ooh, this is different than the one I had.
3381840	3382840	It's like all these guns.
3382840	3384080	I can't carry them all.
3384080	3389000	I mean, it's just loot and the little robot and clap trap is awesome.
3389000	3390000	All right.
3390000	3392040	I watched Dan play through it on Xbox.
3392040	3395240	Well, this series I'm about to get to get into is awesome.
3395240	3396360	I remember this from the eighties.
3396360	3399160	It was one of my favorite role playing series growing up.
3399160	3403580	I even liked the NES sports, even though some people hate them, but I remember it as a kid.
3403580	3404580	It's Ultima.
3404580	3405800	Remember the Ultima series?
3405800	3406800	It's Ultima Exodus.
3406800	3407800	Yeah.
3407800	3408800	There was Ultima online.
3408800	3411600	It was like kind of the first MMO in some ways.
3411600	3417640	You know, Ultima has a great history behind it and Ultima it's coming back y'all.
3417640	3421120	Oh, but not in the way you might think.
3421120	3426400	No, there's, there's no like Ultima 10 or, you know, any new Ultima underworld or something
3426400	3427400	being announced.
3427400	3428400	No.
3428400	3432860	EA is going to be releasing Ultima forever.
3432860	3433860	It's a cross-platform.
3433860	3437080	It'll take 13 years to come out.
3437080	3441840	I just want to point out Duke Nukem's last game was also named Duke Nukem forever.
3441840	3443840	Hence my comment.
3443840	3449020	Ultima forever is a cross-platform free to play role playing game.
3449020	3454240	It's being developed by BioWare, which okay, we like BioWare, right?
3454240	3456880	But it's free to play, which okay.
3456880	3461520	It's going to be published under what they call the play for free label.
3461520	3463960	What a descriptive label for EA.
3463960	3467000	That's so weird that they would put it under that label.
3467000	3469320	Battlefield Heroes is also that same division.
3469320	3470320	Okay.
3470320	3471320	Well, Battlefield Heroes is pretty good.
3471320	3473720	So, oh, wait, no, I'm thinking 1942.
3473720	3477000	It's kind of, you think of the shooter from Capcom from how many years ago?
3477000	3478000	No, no, no.
3478000	3479000	They had a Battlefield game.
3479000	3481440	I don't remember if it was Battlefield Heroes or not.
3481440	3484040	Whatever the one it was on, maybe that was Heroes.
3484040	3486080	You will be controlling an avatar.
3486080	3488440	There's a cartoon aesthetic to it.
3488440	3493120	There's a character named Lady British now and I'm assuming that's because Lord British
3493120	3494720	is no longer with EA.
3494720	3496200	Lord British is Richard Garriott.
3496200	3499840	He's off doing his own thing, trying to travel to space and all that and has the Facebook
3499840	3500840	thing.
3500840	3505520	So now there's Lady British, which you got to admit it's kind of a nice little work around
3505520	3508160	for Lord British not being there anymore.
3508160	3514760	So yeah, they are saying in the press release, the first great Western RPG has been lovingly
3514760	3517040	restored in Ultima forever.
3517040	3518360	You can sign up for the beta.
3518360	3519360	Ultimaforever.com.
3519360	3524640	I got to admit, I'm curious, BioWare makes a lot of good stuff.
3524640	3525640	I'll play it.
3525640	3528960	The free to play thing makes me a little nervous, but I do like Ultima.
3528960	3535000	So it's kind of one of those, well, free is a great trial price, isn't it?
3535000	3540200	It's better to pay nothing for a demo than to pay something for a demo.
3540200	3541560	I'm signing up for the beta.
3541560	3543840	I am so sorry, Bobby Blackwolf.
3543840	3546440	Richard Garriott, he's correcting me in chat.
3546440	3548280	He didn't try to travel to space.
3548280	3550380	He did go to space.
3550380	3552920	I am so effing sorry for that oversight.
3552920	3558640	He went to space and he made some stupid paintings in space, which keep popping up in that stupid
3558640	3560360	garage sale game he has.
3560360	3564360	Gameguru at live.vognetwork.com says, if you want to play a free to play Ultima, go to
3564360	3569680	Good Old Games, Ultima 4, and the two worlds of Ultima games are free over there.
3569680	3571280	I didn't know Ultima 4 was still free.
3571280	3575320	I thought that was just a weekend promotion, but yeah, there are some good Ultima goodness
3575320	3577160	over at Good Old Games.
3577160	3581000	When I was talking about Ultima Revival, Stan had brought up Ultima Dancing Game, cause
3581000	3582440	you know, that's where everything's going these days.
3582440	3585120	Acidic Vampire follows that up with Ultima Rhythm.
3585120	3588840	No, I don't, I mean, Ulta Rhythm.
3588840	3592880	There was some good music in the NES ports of Ultima, but I think for a long time there
3592880	3595200	really wasn't music in the Ultima games.
3595200	3599800	Then later on you would get like the AdLib soundtracks and so forth, but I forgot about
3599800	3601040	the AdLib.
3601040	3604000	Yeah, I had one of those.
3604000	3605000	Fuck Sound Blaster.
3605000	3607240	I had an AdLib.
3607240	3608240	That thing was the shit.
3608240	3614760	All right, anyhow, that's it, Ultima Forever, coming soon, Dark Sakura.
3614760	3615760	I just signed up for the beta.
3615760	3616760	Did you?
3616760	3617760	I just did, yeah.
3617760	3618760	I kind of want to sign up too.
3618760	3619760	We'll see.
3619760	3621760	Is it a Facebook game?
3621760	3623760	I don't see anything about that.
3623760	3624760	If it's a Facebook game, I'm out.
3624760	3630780	Well, if it's on Facebook, then I'm sure as fuck not going to play it, but I mean, I won't
3630780	3633240	find out until they put out a release, you know?
3633240	3634240	Yeah.
3634240	3638800	It's an Ultima free-to-play game, though, but this is, this is cartoony.
3638800	3647720	Okay, whatever, okay, so how about a new model for PS3?
3647720	3648720	Another one?
3648720	3649720	Wait a minute.
3649720	3651640	Sony's only supposed to put out two models this cycle.
3651640	3663120	The 4000 series is rumored to be out at Gamescom next month, and it is, there's a 4011C is
3663120	3668800	the one that we've got a picture of here, I mean, it still looks like a Foreman grill,
3668800	3675680	but at any rate, the pictures, sorry, the pictures and information were coming from
3675680	3683160	the British Agency of Telecommunications website, so I mean, it looks like it's ridged with
3683160	3688560	a sliding panel, but I mean, like I said, still looks like a Foreman grill, but it does
3688560	3691980	fall in with the FCC documents that Sony filed earlier in the month.
3691980	3696600	This does have the new waffle attachment, though, so you can make waffles!
3696600	3698600	Waffles!
3698600	3701800	I wonder if I can cook chicken on it, and then we'll have waffles.
3701800	3704560	Fact or crap, though, because this whole thing's still a rumor, right?
3704560	3709040	Well, we've got a picture of it, and they did file documents with the FCC.
3709040	3714120	Well, the fact that there's a new system SKU coming that's, you know, this FCC filing true,
3714120	3718360	the fact that these pictures are of it or not, eh, maybe.
3718360	3723680	I'm going to the Brazilian website real quick.
3723680	3726840	It'd be better if it was a hoax, it'd be better if it was all wood grain.
3726840	3728320	Yes, I want it in English.
3728320	3731960	I do not speak Portuguese website.
3731960	3736360	Anyhow, do we need another PlayStation design, though?
3736360	3737840	I think I put it in Esperanto.
3737840	3742280	Well, there is, I mean, there's a lot of speculation on what it was, and based on these pictures,
3742280	3746760	which they're assuming are real, they said it looked like it had top-loading disk drive,
3746760	3750400	which that would be weird, but...
3750400	3754200	Going back to the PlayStation 1 with that, it's pretty cool.
3754200	3755640	We know how well that worked.
3755640	3758980	That'd be interesting, I gotta say.
3758980	3762240	Can I prop the door open to load region-locked games?
3762240	3764320	I guess I don't have to worry about that on PS3.
3764320	3765320	Only one.
3765320	3766320	Only one, yeah.
3766320	3768720	All right, moving on.
3768720	3773200	So I know this is going to come as a shock, but there's another game being ripped off
3773200	3775700	on the iPhone App Store.
3775700	3776960	This time it's Torchlight.
3776960	3779920	Apparently there's a game called Armed Heroes Online.
3779920	3782720	Yes, I know, sounds generic enough.
3782720	3788760	It's on the Canadian iTunes store, and apparently they've ripped off nearly all the assets for
3788760	3790760	Torchlight.
3790760	3802060	And the game code doesn't look like it's actually been ripped, but definitely all the assets
3802060	3810200	from the game, all the 3D models and stuff, have been ripped and put into this game.
3810200	3812420	So that's kind of surprising.
3812420	3814720	And the makers of Torchlight are understandably pissed.
3814720	3817300	Yeah, they're definitely pissed off.
3817300	3818300	Now here's the question.
3818300	3821780	Obviously, and I think it mentions this in the story, it's coming from another country.
3821780	3826760	It's not a US country, or excuse me, it's not a US or Canadian company even that's doing
3826760	3827760	it.
3827760	3828760	It's a company out of Beijing, right?
3828760	3830480	Yeah, EGLS Technology.
3830480	3832320	They're based out of Beijing.
3832320	3833720	And the game itself is free to play.
3833720	3839640	Of course, they have in-app purchases, some upwards to almost $100.
3839640	3844880	And it's just bad.
3844880	3849160	The makers of Torchlight can't sue this company.
3849160	3851880	And if it were me, I would be so mad.
3851880	3853140	I would want to sue.
3853140	3855600	But you can't do that, really.
3855600	3858080	That's not the way the world works, sadly.
3858080	3862960	So now it comes back to, well, Apple should be able to recognize this stuff.
3862960	3867660	But if I'm hearing it correctly, they didn't rip off the game, they ripped off all the
3867660	3869200	art assets.
3869200	3875040	So to a person who looks at 100 apps a day, you know, to give the approval or denial,
3875040	3876460	maybe they didn't catch it.
3876460	3877500	So now what do you do?
3877500	3878960	How do you stop this shit?
3878960	3883760	Well, they must have, they should have a way that you can flag it or something and say,
3883760	3891480	you know, flagging for, you know, obscenities or for, you know, copyright infringement or
3891480	3892480	something like that.
3892480	3894440	So this can be looked at by somebody.
3894440	3898200	And granted, there's gonna be some false positives or whatever people are saying, oh, I'm just
3898200	3901000	gonna, I'm gonna say you ripped off Tetris or something.
3901000	3906520	But you know, it would be a good way to, you know, have it police itself, I guess.
3906520	3908400	I don't know.
3908400	3910800	I have to say, that's actually kind of a good idea.
3910800	3915360	You know, and people who just cry wolf too much would obviously be banned themselves
3915360	3916920	from being able to do that in the future.
3916920	3920800	But yeah, I think they're gonna need to go to some type of community policing system,
3920800	3921800	unfortunately.
3921800	3925200	I mean, Apple's, I think, been pretty good when this stuff is called to their attention.
3925200	3929120	I mean, I've heard that they just, like this company, will probably never be able to put
3929120	3931920	another thing up on the iTunes store.
3931920	3933920	But oh, well, they'll just apply under a new name.
3933920	3938520	Oh, yeah, it's gonna be really hard to get one of those $100 developer licenses.
3938520	3939520	So.
3939520	3940520	Yep.
3940520	3941520	So.
3941520	3946320	I'm sure that'll be difficult for them to acquire and change their name to, you know.
3946320	3947360	I don't know.
3947360	3950120	Not company that ripped off Torchlight Inc.
3950120	3956820	Well, this is a game people are excited about and maybe it'll get ripped off and put out
3956820	3960260	here sooner than the actual game itself will come out here.
3960260	3962480	Phantasy Star Online 2.
3962480	3967120	It is officially, as of this week, coming to North America and Europe.
3967120	3970840	It's happening early next year, early 2013.
3970840	3972200	And it's pretty.
3972200	3975960	Producer Satoshi Sakai says the wait will be worth it.
3975960	3980640	Quote, the number one thing we want to provide to players in PSO2 is an adventure that changes
3980640	3982680	every time they log in.
3982680	3987760	Just as a great tabletop RPG experience revolves around imaginative and unexpected encounters,
3987760	3992520	we want players to consistently be surprised as they explore dungeons and undertake quests.
3992520	3996820	I don't, speaking of surprise, I don't know if you saw the article where apparently that
3996820	4000800	game was hacked and someone had moved the NPCs around.
4000800	4003360	And so they put them on top of buildings and stuff like that.
4003360	4004360	Already?
4004360	4005360	Already.
4005360	4006360	Good gosh.
4006360	4011360	It was funny, though, because they showed, it's like, hey, those quest-giving people
4011360	4013400	are way up there.
4013400	4015520	That's unfortunate.
4015520	4017000	Wow.
4017000	4022400	I guess some other things with this.
4022400	4027200	It's out in Japan right now and it's free to download and it's free to sign up for because
4027200	4028200	I know Shane.
4028200	4031080	He might call into the show later to talk about it and I've been begging him to do something
4031080	4036000	for VOG on it, but, uh, he's been playing it because I guess you can just sign up and
4036000	4037000	play it.
4037000	4042200	And he's been begging me to play with him, but I'm like, no, cause I don't like the Japanese
4042200	4045320	text will frustrate me to no end that I don't understand everything.
4045320	4047040	I have to know every little detail.
4047040	4049800	It's not a good idea for me to play this game.
4049800	4053560	So, but it totally play the crap out of it.
4053560	4056920	I was going to say, if you know a little more Japanese and it doesn't bother you as much
4056920	4060280	as it does me that you don't understand it, um, go check it out.
4060280	4062680	Apparently you can, it's out now in Japan.
4062680	4068680	It's easy to get in there and play, uh, let's move on before we get to the release date
4068680	4070240	Stark Sakura.
4070240	4074240	Well, um, here's another case of stupid parents.
4074240	4081220	Um, there's a dad, uh, blaming Microsoft for his son spending money, which I don't see
4081220	4086760	how Microsoft stood there with, you know, strings on his hand or mind control device.
4086760	4088760	The guy's name is Sam Guerra.
4088760	4091000	Um, his son's name is Nick.
4091000	4096460	Uh, they live in Wolverhampton in, uh, over in the UK.
4096460	4105680	And uh, he said that the son spent, uh, at that 1,150 pounds on Xbox live, which is a
4105680	4113200	good two grand here, roughly, um, basically spending about a hundred pounds a day on games
4113200	4115520	such as FIFA and call of duty.
4115520	4117680	But he wasn't realizing he was spending real money.
4117680	4120920	Why aren't you watching your fucking bank account?
4120920	4125800	Why do you have this credit card put in the system when you have a 12 year old playing
4125800	4129960	it who does, uh, apparently wasn't paying attention in school and did not understand
4129960	4132400	how money works.
4132400	4138080	You know, especially since they do put the warnings up there, you know, they've got it
4138080	4143920	on there exactly how much different items cost in terms of points.
4143920	4146640	Sometimes you can run up those charges behind your parents back.
4146640	4150240	Like when I was 12 I was addicted to prodigy chat rooms.
4150240	4152040	No, no, no, no, no.
4152040	4157200	I got in so much fucking trouble though, the month that bill came in home and I'm not even,
4157200	4160480	I'm not even getting it to them for, you know, saying that, Oh, I didn't know it was real
4160480	4161480	money.
4161480	4165320	That's bullshit because yes, they're going to try to use the excuse because it's Microsoft
4165320	4166320	points.
4166320	4168580	The problem is though, when you run out of Microsoft points, you have to refill it, which
4168580	4170640	means you have to go purchase Microsoft points.
4170640	4172740	It says purchase Microsoft points.
4172740	4175760	It shows you this is how much 1000 Microsoft points costs.
4175760	4180840	This is how much 8,000 Microsoft points costs and it has real money attached to it.
4180840	4182760	You're telling me that he didn't know that was real money.
4182760	4183920	He knew that was real money.
4183920	4185400	Yeah, no one's that dumb.
4185400	4186400	I'm sorry.
4186400	4190440	And if your child is that dumb, then clearly needs to be in special education or something.
4190440	4196360	And if he needs to not be playing the xbox on super, it's not Microsoft's fault.
4196360	4198080	It's your stupid kid's fault.
4198080	4201840	And it's your fault for not being a better parent for not being more responsible and
4201840	4205040	keeping an eye on what the hell your damn kids doing instead of using the xbox as a
4205040	4207640	babysitter and a story.
4207640	4211200	All I gotta say is that kid looks like he has fear in his eyes and that father looks
4211200	4213000	like he is angry as hell.
4213000	4216320	So I'm guessing that he was taken care of.
4216320	4221240	Microsoft their response and I'm quoting, there are multiple opportunities where consumers
4221240	4223960	are asked to confirm their purchases.
4223960	4226920	The price is clearly displayed on the screen.
4226920	4231060	It should also be noted that xbox live accounts registered for children's use have online
4231060	4236480	activity automatically defaulted to off and that these can be enabled should a parent's
4236480	4239520	wish in the family settings section.
4239520	4243120	These settings include specifying the email address to which all purchase notifications
4243120	4247380	are sent and using other features such as over the shoulder approval that allow the
4247380	4252360	account holder to give permission for purchases by typing in a password.
4252360	4254520	So yeah, again, you're stupid.
4254520	4257600	I love this comment in our chat room live.vognetwork.com.
4257600	4264360	Game Guru says it's always FIFA and Ahamkara says FIFA again, why is that game always involved
4264360	4266280	when it comes to money theft?
4266280	4267280	Hold on though.
4267280	4268840	It's not really theft in this case.
4268840	4271280	It's just their massive irresponsibility.
4271280	4272480	They're just trying to pass the buck.
4272480	4273480	That's all they're trying.
4273480	4274480	Oh yeah.
4274480	4277800	Um, the parent wants the money back and they're that desperate.
4277800	4278800	Well, no.
4278800	4279800	What do you think?
4279800	4280800	Oh, we just want an apology.
4280800	4282360	No, you don't.
4282360	4285840	You want your damn money and you're, you know, you're trying to say face is what you're trying
4285840	4286840	to do.
4286840	4287840	Yeah.
4287840	4292200	And sorry, it needs to burn a hole in your pocket so that you understand, you know, hit
4292200	4294480	you where you're hurt, where it hurts.
4294480	4295480	Have some responsibility.
4295480	4296640	I mean, let's, let's put it this way.
4296640	4301480	I mean, this is a 12 year old that's grown up in pretty much like a digital age.
4301480	4302920	He knows how it fucking works.
4302920	4307880	He is not fucking oblivious to how purchasing stuff works.
4307880	4310760	Acidic vampire in our chat says you said the kid was 12.
4310760	4313740	If he doesn't know what currency is, then you must live under our rock.
4313740	4317240	Like that's the age where you're in junior high school and aren't you like buying lunches
4317240	4318240	sometimes?
4318240	4319320	They know what currency is.
4319320	4320320	They come on.
4320320	4321320	This is ridiculous.
4321320	4326920	It's just because even Josh knows what currency is at this point probably.
4326920	4334740	He knows he probably understood that he was spending money, but as I've mentioned before,
4334740	4338280	when the brain is developing, it's all about the immediate reward instead of the longterm
4338280	4339280	consequence.
4339280	4345760	And this goes on in guys at least until between 25 and 27 on an average developmental range.
4345760	4349800	And for women between 24 and 25, I don't know what you're talking about.
4349800	4351440	It's brain development.
4351440	4352440	Anyway.
4352440	4357680	You mean all those trips I went on between 25 and 27 was just me lashing out?
4357680	4358680	Okay.
4358680	4363120	And I will find, there's actually an article on it a few months ago in National Geographic,
4363120	4365680	but I read everything.
4365680	4369920	But basically the brain is as big as it's going to be, but it's still forming neural
4369920	4373520	pathways until it reaches full maturity, which is in the late twenties.
4373520	4378240	Which explains a lot of drama when you're young, you know, and bad relationships and
4378240	4379240	lots of, you know.
4379240	4380240	Oh my God.
4380240	4381240	Dark soccer.
4381240	4383760	I can't believe you would say that.
4383760	4385920	Shut up.
4385920	4393160	But it, you know, it does why, you know, there's the going out and drinking and then driving
4393160	4396280	and wrecking your car when you're not thinking about the consequence because your brain right
4396280	4400840	then is not programmed to think of the longterm consequences programmed to think of watch
4400840	4405040	out or someone's going to use that as an excuse in court officer.
4405040	4409760	I was drinking and driving because my brain isn't fully developed yet.
4409760	4410760	You know what?
4410760	4419400	A dark soccer on orange lounge radio said, no, clearly there is different, but like,
4419400	4425480	but going back to a kid, the kid's going to have poor impulse control without having a
4425480	4429640	set reinforced expectation of punishment.
4429640	4434800	If they do something bad, you know, it's like, or they might not even care, but the
4434800	4438280	point is, is that it doesn't mean he's stupid that he doesn't know better.
4438280	4441160	It means he knew better and didn't care.
4441160	4446760	So that, that's completely on the parent that you have to, if you don't want any of that
4446760	4451360	crap to happen, you have to, you know, cut off the means of making it happen.
4451360	4457920	You have to not be an enabler, not necessarily disable the action, but not make it open to
4457920	4459760	where they can actively do it.
4459760	4461720	That's part of your responsibility.
4461720	4464000	All right.
4464000	4467840	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what money we can
4467840	4473360	spend on little purchases in the game in the next couple of weeks.
4473360	4475760	Loki start here in the U S what's coming out here.
4475760	4479720	Uh, I'm, there's really not anything coming up this week.
4479720	4485240	I want to say the only game coming out is heroes are ruined on three D S that's it kind
4485240	4487400	of a boring week, which actually is supposed to be a pretty good game.
4487400	4488400	It's coming from screen.
4488400	4489680	So check it out.
4489680	4495000	Tell Japan on the X-Box three 16, Assassin's Creed one and two welcome pack, I guess kind
4495000	4501520	of a catch up collection is coming out in Japan at a lower price on the PlayStation
4501520	4502520	three.
4502520	4507600	That same pack is coming out as well as some other games, including Sangoku Hime Senko
4507600	4511240	no Taika Akasuki no Hyu.
4511240	4514360	That's in regular and luxury limited edition.
4514360	4516480	I'm trying to figure out what this game is.
4516480	4520800	It's a strategy game and there aren't really any screenshots posted, but I see like dragons
4520800	4521800	and tigers.
4521800	4523600	So I'm dragging.
4523600	4524920	That's ancient mythology.
4524920	4525920	Yeah.
4525920	4528800	So maybe it's like kind of a Nobunaga ish game.
4528800	4529800	I don't know.
4529800	4534440	Um, yeah, but then it didn't have much to do with actual with crouching tiger hidden
4534440	4535440	drag.
4535440	4537440	No doubt it.
4537440	4541000	Now what I find also interesting is that this is a peripheral coming out in Japan.
4541000	4546160	It's like a 500 gigabyte drive for your PlayStation three, basically what it is.
4546160	4549820	It's like a, um, recorder kit and this is kind of weird.
4549820	4552480	It's like this little thing that you can, I guess, record TV.
4552480	4553480	Yeah.
4553480	4556400	They had like a DVR thing that was supposed to for the PSU back there.
4556400	4557400	Yeah.
4557400	4558400	So, I mean, they get that kind of stuff in Japan.
4558400	4559860	Not here.
4559860	4561360	You can buy stuff like that price.
4561360	4566760	Um, yeah, but it's not official technically and it doesn't save your PlayStation drive
4566760	4569240	unless you use some creative workarounds.
4569240	4578520	Uh, anyhow, also pointing out on the PlayStation Vita, uh, Jikyu Powerful Pro Yaku 2012 comes
4578520	4580120	out from Konami this week.
4580120	4581120	Baseball.
4581120	4582120	Yup.
4582120	4590400	And lastly, let me check the 3DS here, uh, if it'll load for me, I love live radio.
4590400	4595680	Rune Factory 4 comes out this week as well as Rayman Origins gets its Japanese release
4595680	4596680	on the 3DS.
4596680	4602280	And something they call, this isn't a game, but some type of accessory candy bar for Nintendo
4602280	4603280	3DS.
4603280	4604280	Candy bar is a doll maker.
4604280	4606800	In black, blue, peach and white.
4606800	4607800	Yeah.
4607800	4608800	Is that the doll maker?
4608800	4609800	Yeah, it is.
4609800	4610800	Yeah, I guess.
4610800	4611800	I guess.
4611800	4614080	Is this some type of like accessory kit for stickers and stuff for the 3DS?
4614080	4615080	I guess.
4615080	4616800	Let me, are there any other screen caps?
4616800	4617800	Nope.
4617800	4618800	That's it.
4618800	4621400	Well, I know that there's like a series of virtual doll makers that are called candy
4621400	4622400	bar.
4622400	4623400	Hmm.
4623400	4624400	So.
4624400	4625400	Well, there you go.
4625400	4626400	Japanese release dates.
4626400	4627760	Two things in the UK.
4627760	4635160	Tony Hulk's Pro Skater HD on the 18th and Boulder Dash XL 3D on the 20th for the 3DS.
4635160	4636160	That's it.
4636160	4638720	I wonder where everybody's at right now.
4638720	4639720	I guess on vacation.
4639720	4641240	Cause we don't have a lot of games coming out.
4641240	4643320	The news was a little bit slow this week too.
4643320	4644560	It's weird.
4644560	4647360	Although there was a big story for you, Loki.
4647360	4648360	I know.
4648360	4650480	There was a few things actually.
4650480	4654320	It wasn't mentioned on here, but they had another screenshot or trailer.
4654320	4657800	I think it was a screenshot for the Earth Defense Force game.
4657800	4664600	Earth Defense Force 3 Portable is the one that was 2017.
4664600	4665600	Over here on 360.
4665600	4667640	Remember it's coming out on the Vita.
4667640	4673680	They showed a screenshot with the Jetpack Girl from number 2, which is awesome.
4673680	4676240	Not to mention that that game also has 4 player co-op.
4676240	4677960	Also awesome.
4677960	4681000	But D3!
4681000	4683000	I love them.
4683000	4686400	They announced Earth Defense Forces 4.
4686400	4691200	They have a teaser page on their website and it's a new game from Sandlot.
4691200	4693880	I can't wait.
4693880	4695800	And in fact it's Earth Defense Forces.
4695800	4698920	I don't remember if the other games were Earth Defense Forces or if it's just Earth Defense
4698920	4699920	Force.
4699920	4701960	So I don't care.
4701960	4704360	I'm gonna play that sucker.
4704360	4707240	And if I have to import it, I'm gonna import it.
4707240	4710440	Cause I love me some Earth Defense Force.
4710440	4713080	Oh I'm sure it'll come out here too.
4713080	4719120	Oh yeah it will, but not after a, you know, quite a delay, but oh I cannot wait.
4719120	4721120	It's gonna be awesome.
4721120	4722120	I don't even care.
4722120	4728040	I mean really cause it could be an absolutely terrible game cause 2017 was a terrible game.
4728040	4729040	But it was fun.
4729040	4730840	And that was the best part about it.
4730840	4734560	So hopefully we'll see something before Tokyo Game Show.
4734560	4738520	But if not, maybe at Tokyo Game Show.
4738520	4745400	Alright well there was a rumor going around at Comic Con about a possible game made out
4745400	4748000	of Tron Uprising.
4748000	4750520	There was a Tron Uprising panel at Comic Con apparently.
4750520	4751520	I didn't even know about that.
4751520	4752520	But apparently they were doing one.
4752520	4755320	And I don't know if you've seen the anime yet, but it's pretty good.
4755320	4758860	Well I keep calling it an anime cause it has that style to it, but I guess technically
4758860	4759860	it's not.
4759860	4763000	I mean if you want to get technical with me it's not, but whatever.
4763000	4764000	Cartoon.
4764000	4765000	I missed a bunch of episodes of that.
4765000	4766000	Whatever you want to call it.
4766000	4767000	Tron Uprising.
4767000	4768000	Anime is short for animation.
4768000	4769000	Yep.
4769000	4770120	So yes and it is an animation.
4770120	4771400	So deal.
4771400	4778160	But anyhow they had a panel at Comic Con and I guess they were told at the panel this would
4778160	4780000	look great on a Wii.
4780000	4781000	Wait a minute.
4781000	4782000	Dot dot dot.
4782000	4785500	And a lot of folks took that away saying oh my gosh they're teasing a Tron Uprising game
4785500	4786500	on the Wii.
4786500	4788680	Which had me thinking why?
4788680	4790680	The Wii is pretty much gone.
4790680	4791680	It'll be a Wii U.
4791680	4792680	It'll be a Wii U.
4792680	4793680	Yeah.
4793680	4794680	Right.
4794680	4795680	They're not putting anything on the Wii.
4795680	4800240	And then it came out and N-Space actually came out and said we were actually referencing
4800240	4804000	the Tron Evolution Battle Grids game on the Wii.
4804000	4806640	They are not working on a new Tron title at this time.
4806640	4807640	Boo.
4807640	4808640	So the little tease.
4808640	4809640	It's still early for the series.
4809640	4812200	I mean given like a year.
4812200	4814160	Especially if there's going to be a third movie.
4814160	4817360	Especially you know because Disney's running out of things to make games on right now.
4817360	4821320	I mean because they have you know Epic Mickey 2 and stuff, but next year they'll be like
4821320	4825920	uhhhh well let's see another Pixar movie maybe?
4825920	4828400	Well no I don't think there's another Pixar movie anytime soon.
4828400	4830440	Brave just came out so you gotta wait till next year.
4830440	4832440	I think the monster's a single.
4832440	4835680	Wreck-It Ralph, which I'm about to get into here.
4835680	4839720	Wreck-It Ralph has been confirmed that he's going to be a playable character in Sonic
4839720	4841540	Racing Transformed.
4841540	4844920	No word if it's exclusive to the Nintendo consoles because we know there's that whole
4844920	4850120	interesting Nintendo deal going on, but he will be a character for sure in the Nintendo
4850120	4851640	3DS version on November 16th.
4851640	4855280	This is that same racing game that has like Danica Patrick and stuff, huh?
4855280	4857520	So you can be Wreck-It Ralph or Danica Patrick.
4857520	4863560	Makes sense since they've got a cameo from Dr. Eggman in there or Botnik.
4863560	4864800	But that's kind of fun.
4864800	4867480	So there you go.
4867480	4869880	Those are some Disney gaming news.
4869880	4870880	Dang it.
4870880	4871880	What?
4871880	4872880	You alright?
4872880	4877080	No the shirt that I wanted to buy is sold out only in XXL and that's way too big for
4877080	4878080	me.
4878080	4879080	What shirt were you trying to buy?
4879080	4882320	The ladies Normandy crew shirt.
4882320	4883320	It was 11 bucks.
4883320	4887440	I do want to get the bumper sticker for my car that says my other ride is a Normandy.
4887440	4890200	I wouldn't mind the hoodie but it's 50 bucks.
4890200	4896080	Alright let's travel back in time to when gaming was simpler.
4896080	4898880	And there wasn't 50 dollar tie-ins for video games.
4898880	4899880	Actually there totally was.
4899880	4904760	I remember a catalog in Nintendo Power once that was selling Super Mario Brothers underwear.
4904760	4908460	So they've been profiting off video games for forever.
4908460	4912720	I don't know if this is a game that they profited off of but I imagine they made a little bit
4912720	4914120	of money off of this game.
4914120	4917120	Dark Soccer what is tonight's classic game of the week?
4917120	4921880	Classic game of the week is Shinobi for the arcade.
4921880	4923200	Yep it is Shinobi.
4923200	4924520	It's about damn time I actually did that.
4924520	4929800	Instead of sequels like Shadow Dancer and Revenge of Shinobi and all that.
4929800	4934880	So basically you are Jomosashi who has to rescue kidnapped students from a group of
4934880	4937880	terrorists.
4937880	4943120	After the arcade version it went out on the master system and then was converted to the
4943120	4949520	NES PC Engine and home computers and now you can play it emulated on the Wii and Xbox 360.
4949520	4952920	So yeah there were all kinds of stuff.
4952920	4957680	You are trying to stop a criminal organization called Zeed.
4957680	4959920	Then they are kidnapping the ninja children.
4959920	4962080	Ooh so you have to go rescue them.
4962080	4965880	Ooh and then beat all the bosses.
4965880	4969600	Can I just say this is my favorite most interesting thing in Shinobi and maybe you are going to
4969600	4974320	get to this in a minute but it's the whole Warhol Marilyn Monroe portrait that's randomly
4974320	4975880	in the background in one stage.
4975880	4977480	And the mist colored Spiderman.
4977480	4978480	Yes.
4978480	4980800	What is up with that?
4980800	4983960	So your stages you had five stages.
4983960	4989560	Your first one is pursue the terrorists where you have to kill Ken-O and then two is you
4989560	4994800	kill Black Turtle Attack Chopper and they drop a bunch of ninja on you.
4994800	5003440	Then three is killing Mandara that sounds kind of like I guess a good tranny name.
5003440	5006240	And then four is killing the lobster.
5006240	5007240	Mandara.
5007240	5010160	Shantae you stay.
5010160	5014080	I'm not saying trannies are the same as drag queens because that's offensive and even that
5014080	5016120	term is offensive to some so I apologize.
5016120	5021200	I'm just trying to be ignorant radio hosts.
5021200	5026360	Anyway mission five is killing the masked ninja.
5026360	5027660	So it's side scrolling.
5027660	5029740	You can throw your shuriken.
5029740	5034200	You can hit them with your sword and you also have ninja magic.
5034200	5035200	Ooh.
5035200	5042100	And your enemies can hide behind boxes or use blocks to shield your attacks.
5042100	5046840	So and then if you complete each stage without using your ninja magic or without using any
5046840	5050480	shuriken or bullets you earn points bonuses.
5050480	5054760	And you have three minutes to finish each stage.
5054760	5060320	So for the Master System it came out in Japan on June 19, 1988 and then came out in the
5060320	5062680	US after that.
5062680	5066080	There were different bonus stages that were in the game.
5066080	5070440	We had for home versions we had the Amiga.
5070440	5078080	We had the Atari ST, Commodore 64, the Armstrong CPC and ZX Spectrum.
5078080	5084640	And they were all developed by the sales curve and published by Virgin Mastertronic and in
5084640	5088600	Europe and by Sega in North America except for the Amstrad and Spectrum versions because
5088600	5090240	guess what we didn't have that.
5090240	5098040	The PC Engine version came out in Japan by Asmik on December 8, 1989.
5098040	5104520	And then we had a NES version and like I said later on came out by on Wii and Xbox 360.
5104520	5108440	And then in the Sonic Ultimate, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection it was included with that
5108440	5109440	too.
5109440	5112040	So yeah there's actually not anything on here.
5112040	5118280	I'm gonna try to, hold on I'm gonna find this real quick, play some music Rob.
5118280	5119280	Oops.
5119280	5126960	It's not really music so much as it is dude jumping up over.
5126960	5131480	Okay the Spiderman was actually in Revenge of Shinobi.
5131480	5134200	But there were guys that moved like Spiderman to Shinobi.
5134200	5137800	There's totally like an inverse Spiderman looking guy right in the first stage.
5137800	5142320	So and apparently Batman was in Revenge of Shinobi as well.
5142320	5145320	So that's it Shinobi.
5145320	5148920	There it is your classic game of the week Shinobi for the arcade by Sega.
5148920	5152560	Do you know what Shinobi means?
5152560	5155680	No I think it means stealth but don't quote me.
5155680	5160620	Alright we are gonna take a break here folks but we will be right back don't go anywhere
5160620	5164760	we have rapid fire news coming up, Twitter topics at twitter.com slash o-l-r get those
5164760	5165760	in.

5171080	5178720	of Orange Lounge Radio.
5178720	5185460	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this July the 15th of 2012 with episode
5185460	5192880	number 465 of our show live as we are every Sunday at vog network dot com.
5192880	5197800	We're about to get into some rapid fire news but I wanted to ask Jamie I noticed one thing
5197800	5202160	we haven't talked about on air yet is you know what we're eating behind the scenes.
5202160	5207040	Loki is you know chowing down on his Carl's Jr. tonight but Dark Soccer and I were enjoying
5207040	5208040	beer.
5208040	5209960	Yes cause beer is the food of the gods.
5209960	5215440	I gotta say it's pretty awesome because today just on a whim Alan and I went out for lunch
5215440	5220440	brunch whatever at this place we've gone to for dinner sometimes a brewing company we
5220440	5224600	have here in SAC and we went there for lunch and what we learned today is that whenever
5224600	5230600	you eat there on a Sunday they give you free beer to go like the waitress came by was like
5230600	5235200	okay um now you get free 22 ounce beer for each entree you order so what beer did you
5235200	5238980	want to take home with you and we're like cool you get free beer and I'm like bring
5238980	5244320	me the darkest thing you got because I only drink dark beer yeah so that what what's Alan
5244320	5249640	what's the name of the brand on the counter there it's a midnight what is it total total
5249640	5255240	eclipse black ale so Dark Soccer and I are enjoying a beer tonight and yes and it was
5255240	5260280	good and it was good so says Dark Soccer so we're chowing down on free beer I mean it's
5260280	5265880	not like it's food but it's not I mean pretzels with bread yes it's liquid bread all right
5265880	5270320	let's get into some rapid fire news some games you can play while you enjoy your beer and
5270320	5275800	I'm sure this first one would be a really hilarious game with a lot enough beer so you
5275800	5284120	know Ubisoft purveyors of many dance games some great some good you may remember that
5284120	5289280	they did Michael Jackson the experience that's pretty cool then Black Eyed Peas experience
5289280	5298640	all right I'll follow you there now it's the hip-hop dance experience yes you can dance
5298640	5307080	like other hip-hop artists including they're gonna have rappers delight and they even mentioned
5307080	5313040	Flo Rida and I gotta admit I gotta say some of the video that they showed in there they
5313040	5320280	actually show somebody like doing a lot of floor work which good luck seeing that on
5320280	5325080	a connect I don't think that's gonna be able to work but neat if they show you like all
5325080	5332400	the breakdancing stuff and you know I don't know when you talk about like rappers delight
5332400	5347200	being in the game I can't help but think about this I know that's quiet as hell and you can't
5347200	5350800	hear that but that's the rapping grandma from the wedding singer that was great here's the
5350800	5358720	thing I'm I'm torn in a couple things reasons one I mean I don't play a lot of dancing games
5358720	5364760	but back in high school I did take you know like a hip-hop dance class and it was fun
5364760	5372320	so might be something I'm interested in probably not something I'm gonna be picking up although
5372320	5381360	if I do get a free copy I'll be sure to try it out not on camera so that'd be neat black
5381360	5387000	eyed peas I not on camera gee I wonder why black eyed peas the experience though is should
5387000	5392680	be pretty cheap by now so that might try picking that up they also of course this game is being
5392680	5398080	done by a niece and you know they're behind leap beat agents so a little bit of pedigree
5398080	5404080	there and of course near the game itself looks very similar to black eyed peas the experience
5404080	5416760	neat I guess all right so another cool bit of info Nintendo released that they have sold
5416760	5424240	over 5 million 3ds systems in the US to date and that's almost almost been a year's time
5424240	5430920	since they've dropped the price on 3ds so not bad not bad considering that they weren't
5430920	5436720	doing too well as of last year around this time and I'm sure that there is a big help
5436720	5441560	thanks to the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3d which sold over a million copies Super
5441560	5448800	Mario 3d Land which sold 2.1 million copies and Mario Kart 7 which sold 1.75 million copies
5448800	5453560	and of course they haven't really said anything about Kid Icarus Uprising something it's too
5453560	5462240	bad but I don't think it sold that many copies and last but not least Capcom is bringing
5462240	5467680	Jojo's Bizarre Adventure to HD and coming to the Playstation Network and Xbox Live arcade
5467680	5475560	game the wonderful was it System 3 I can't remember it was on that weird arcade hardware
5475560	5482520	but yeah it's 2d fighting game based on the anime series manga series and you know getting
5482520	5490640	the typical Capcom HD Perez special filters treatment it's going to be available for 1600
5490640	5497240	Microsoft points or 1999 and it launches on August 21st on the Playstation Network and
5497240	5506160	22nd on Xbox Live arcade all right moving on a lot of people went squeak about this
5506160	5513000	this week Hello Kitty meets Sonic the Hedgehog yes there's this little doll that is Hello
5513000	5517280	Kitty meeting Sonic the Hedgehog and I know this doesn't make good radio but just as Sonic
5517280	5521960	the Hedgehog it's cute well you know it's kind of it does look like what would happen
5521960	5525360	if the two of them had a baby let's be real it's like it looks like the cosplay outfits
5525360	5529500	that they do for Hello Kitty regularly it's like an if they made it segment out of Conan
5529500	5537200	O'Brien or something like that anyhow these are available the Sonic cross helo couse
5537200	5542040	at Hello Kitty Hello Kitty jumbo plushie is available or will be available at Sega amusement
5542040	5547880	parks in Japan starting in late July it is commemorating the reopening of Sega's Tokyo
5547880	5555320	Joyopolis on June 14th I guess the Hello Kitty Chun-Li plush will have to do for now that's
5555320	5560120	available at Comic-Con for 40 bucks I'm pretty sure it's already gone if you want that not
5560120	5566320	not a fan of Hello Kitty cross Chun-Li not a fan I don't like Chun-Li do you like Dark
5566320	5570160	Stalkers yes especially Morgan's boobs all right well then maybe this news will make
5570160	5575040	you a little more excited again this has to do a little bit with Comic-Con a comment was
5575040	5580680	made by Yoshinori Ono that people are reading into here and it had to do with you know he's
5580680	5585520	been telling fans tell Capcom what you want tell Capcom you want to do Dark Stalkers you
5585520	5590080	know this year apparently he said quote at Comic-Con he said quote this year you don't
5590080	5595240	have to do that and it's not necessarily bad news but he couldn't say much more than that
5595240	5598560	and of course a lot of people are reading into that that oh well if you don't need to
5598560	5604540	bug Capcom anymore it's because it's happening but I mean you know this has been speculated
5604540	5610240	for a while would make a lot of sense I'm sure it's a thing yeah the only bummer is
5610240	5613400	it's going to come out the same year that new consoles start coming out and I bet this
5613400	5618680	is probably for the old consoles so I mean hopefully people don't miss this but it's
5618680	5623120	something that they could release spring fall I mean I don't even think it's necessarily
5623120	5626380	a bad thing that's coming out for new consoles and we don't even know if new consoles are
5626380	5630760	coming out this next year I mean it's speculated that's probably the earliest at the launch
5630760	5637940	but they could still hold off another year true very true additional characters for PlayStation
5637940	5643240	All-Stars Battle Royale have been announced Cole McGrath Jack and Dexter all coming to
5643240	5647560	PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale that of course is the game that sure has a lot of
5647560	5652880	similarities to Super Smash Brothers but trust us it's a completely different game but it
5652880	5657360	has a lot of people very excited it'll be one of the bigger holiday releases from Sony
5657360	5665060	moving on Dark Sakura well for fans of Street Fighter there is going to be a ps3 Street
5665060	5671120	Fighter anniversary collection which actually I think I've brought up before because I mean
5671120	5674380	this has been the pictures have been out for a little while but there's more stuff that's
5674380	5682680	been slated for it what's coming out with this is it looks like it's going to have the
5682680	5691240	ps1 versions of Street of Street Fighter alpha the Street Fighter alpha 3 for PSP and then
5691240	5698560	DLC for Street Fighter 3 Third Strike Online and 175 PSN avatars really all I care about
5698560	5704940	is the reuse statue all I care about that and I wouldn't buy it on ps3 I'd get it on
5704940	5710720	Xbox 360 where I can use a decent controller and then Zone of the Enders there's going
5710720	5716180	to be the HD collection and it's very cel-shaded and j-poppy it looks pretty good from what
5716180	5732480	I saw but it's sorry my nose was itching but basically it's going to be there's a why am
5732480	5740720	I so so tongue-tied today you drink beer no at any rate there's seven minutes of footage
5740720	5748280	from the game available online and it's like I said cel-shaded has anime style cutscenes
5748280	5756280	and it's all j-poppy so moving on from that how about the Steam Summer Sale it's still
5756280	5765560	going we've got as of today Max Payne 3 for 30 bucks which is 50% off NO2070 Warhammer

5829000	5833800	no question this week but we will have the mailbag coming up after a few more news stories
5833800	5846640	Loki all right so let's talk a little bit about fun stuff including DRM that just sucks
5846640	5855200	in Ubisoft you may remember it has the wonderful you play or maybe in this oh yeah wonderful
5855200	5863200	because their server is down perfect example of why this always connected internet DRM
5863200	5869520	sucks and Ubisoft's play are you play client or you're not playing because it's offline
5869520	5877720	right now it's been down for a bit and of course people are pitching a fit because hey
5877720	5884320	I can't play my Assassin's Creed game or hey I can't you know log in at all and this just
5884320	5894200	sucks but just kind of wanted to punctuate the fact that you know this not a good method
5894200	5903360	of DRM in other words here we go again I don't know it's just I don't understand why they
5903360	5915320	I mean I like let me just quote a few complaints in the cannot log into you play forum on Ubisoft
5915320	5920880	Ubisoft you're going to be twats and treat your paying customers like criminals who get
5920880	5925960	to avoid your crap by partying them to begin with here's a tip if you're going to have
5925960	5936720	always on DRM make sure your DRM is always fucking on and you know of course we'll see
5936720	5944840	here how long until the class-action lawsuit probably probably not gonna happen but why
5944840	5949480	are you kidding Loki this is America of course it's gonna happen it's only before before
5949480	5953240	you all blah blah blah to me about the user and agreement and all that stuff you have
5953240	5959680	to click OK to please like that stop the guy who is bitching about Microsoft and you know
5959680	5967760	the kid buying points true that's gonna stop anyone apparently according to their form
5967760	5980680	manager that it's back up now but I mean I don't know it's just it's just not very very
5980680	5984760	good I mean that's the only comment I guess it's been made by those people and apparently
5984760	5988760	they've been having this problem since yesterday morning it's been almost 24 hours since this
5988760	5996920	thing's been down so that kind of sucks Bobby in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says
5996920	6002740	I am still sad SimCity has always on DRM they did confirm that recently again they hope
6002740	6008160	to learn from others mistakes with their SimCity always on DRM now granted that's not Ubisoft
6008160	6013400	but still it's one reason I probably won't buy it the fact that they say that they've
6013400	6017600	they want to learn from others mistakes and they have always on DRM proves that they haven't
6017600	6026600	learned from other people's mistakes plain simple I mean Diablo had problems yep Diablo's
6026600	6030360	continuing to have problems we we went into this a little bit on Horde house plug plug
6030360	6035000	this week my other show that's more about the Blizzard stuff especially World of Warcraft
6035000	6039760	is that we were talking about how Diablo 3's endgame even Blizzard is it to come out and
6039760	6048560	say it's not quite what they anticipated and Diablo 3 it's not a flop but from a fanboy
6048560	6055440	rabidness standpoint like how loyal the fan base is to the game it's losing clout significantly
6055440	6060000	significantly over Diablo 2 I know that sounds like a really weird ranking but let me put
6060000	6065200	it this way if a Diablo 4 were announced tomorrow people wouldn't be as excited as they would
6065200	6075040	have been if the game went a little differently that's my point so anyway well also something
6075040	6079120	to consider when you know people are when they're pitching you the next expansion to
6079120	6086000	Starcraft 2 or something like that which is still supposed to come out in 2013 who gives
6086000	6091280	a shit honestly I mean rabid Starcraft players of which there are still a few but here's
6091280	6095680	my thing is I don't here's what I don't understand okay it's an expansion for what I assume is
6095680	6100720	the single player campaign right or co-op campaign or whatever if you're playing multiplayer
6100720	6104520	just to play like death matches and stuff like that who gives a shit about an expansion
6104520	6109480	supposed to add new units and you got it add new units and maps and other things that will
6109480	6116200	be unique and I believe the Blizzard Dota will be a part of the new expansion which
6116200	6123480	is a big deal for some people shit and that's all right now all right if my Hello Kitty
6123480	6129120	cross Sonic thing would not make Dark Sakura squee I know this next story will make Dark
6129120	6133560	Sakura squeeze so pay attention Dark Sakura because announced during the Marvel panel
6133560	6140800	at this year's San Diego Comic-Con High Moon Studios developing and Activision publishing
6140800	6146800	a Deadpool game yes and I've seen quite a bit of this and I pleased and it's going to
6146800	6152440	be launching on who knows what in 2013 we don't know if it's like a next-gen thing or
6152440	6156480	if it's you know for PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 the usual suspect they say if they got Nolan
6156480	6162360	North to do the voice again Nolan North will be reprising role as the assassin that was
6162360	6168240	the one thing that I didn't see and he's like seriously the best voice actor for Deadpool
6168240	6173080	they didn't specify a whole lot of other answers there were some questions from audience members
6173080	6178000	and so forth and they said there will be lots more to come and the teaser trailer is now
6178000	6180780	out there I want to take a look it's mainly because they can't put out another fucking
6180780	6187640	spider-man game next year it's just like shit what do we need that they need a new a new
6187640	6192560	movie tie-in or game tie-in or Marvel tie-in or something I don't know how about an Avengers
6192560	6199800	game the Ubisoft sorry put out an Avengers game this year and it sucks so I'm just saying
6199800	6204800	that's too bad it is too bad how do you fuck up the Avengers game apparently give it to
6204800	6210480	Ubisoft why do you love Deadpool so much star Sakura for those that may not you know no
6210480	6215840	because he's freaking insane and he's like one of the few good things that Liefeld did
6215840	6222400	because Liefeld just cannot draw people at all but Deadpool is just sort of like yeah
6222400	6225800	he goes around killing people but he makes jokes he's really funny and he's fucked up
6225800	6230400	in the head and like my old wallpaper for a long time was him killing a horde of clowns
6230400	6235780	that were attacking him and it was the best thing ever and that he's super funny and everything
6235780	6239360	that he isn't except there's way too many Deadpool comics out right now so the market
6239360	6244180	was way oversaturated and it also gives Liefeld an excuse to draw again and I do not like
6244180	6252760	Liefeld's drawing and there's that the you know tendency to defect the fourth wall yes
6252760	6256760	that too because well the only other I think like there's a couple of other Marvel characters
6256760	6263360	that do that one of them being She-Hulk who her law firm uses old issues of Marvel comics
6263360	6270160	as legal research so it's pretty funny but yeah she and Deadpool who were two of my favorite
6270160	6274400	characters break the fourth wall all the time and that and Deadpool talks to his inner voices
6274400	6280520	and sometimes they tell him he has to pee and other stuff all right uh Darcyra what
6280520	6290640	do you got for us next to news in news it's not yeah time no no time okay well how about
6290640	6299000	um valve uh having a counter for EA's uh statement about cheapen cheapening intellectual property
6299000	6305880	basically EA's um dude said that uh steam's huge sales will cheapen intellectual property
6305880	6311260	and that they're not gonna copy that they want the they said the game manufacturer makers
6311260	6315080	work hard to make the intellectual property and we're not going to be target we're trying
6315080	6320960	to be Nordstrom did you see that there was a great side-by-side picture of all these
6320960	6325720	games on origin and then what they cost on steam right now and it was it was really something
6325720	6331720	else but you know in the digital world first off target is really not a bad store I want
6331720	6337240	to say I proudly shop at Target despite all the anti-gay stuff you're hearing on the internet
6337240	6341480	whatever deals though with like actual big-name designers like they worked with Anna Sui they
6341480	6345680	were to who's that I think he's already yeah so they get good deals out there and they
6345680	6350320	bring designer goods to the average market now if you had said like Nordstrom in the
6350320	6356380	99 cent clearance center or a store I prefer not to go to in some neighborhoods maybe I
6356380	6360040	would understand that a little more but targets not exactly a bad place well here's the other
6360040	6365360	thing too is they do realize that no one's holding a gun to these developers heads you
6365360	6371440	know about marking their games down it's something that these developers chose to do or these
6371440	6376000	publishers chose to do well but is it one of them EA because Mass Effect 2 and some
6376000	6383080	of the older stuff well they're the ones that chose to do that to mark it down so you know
6383080	6387400	if you don't want cheap in your product then why include yourself in the sale I mean it's
6387400	6392480	not steam going okay we're gonna hey hey developer you know what we're just gonna go ahead and
6392480	6395920	mark your title down so you're just gonna be getting less money for each copy sold I
6395920	6400520	mean they're not doing that they're coordinating with these people that want to be part of
6400520	6406800	these sales so EA is a bit hypocritical there that they're like oh these guys shocked let's
6406800	6413160	mark our own tiles we get some more sales well how about I finish the article because
6413160	6422800	they interviewed the business development chief Jason Holtman and he was basically saying
6422800	6429080	you know they're making money for all their partners the discounts serve different functions
6429080	6433080	that's a quote on here highlighting serves a lot of functions the qualities of the games
6433080	6439540	serve a lot of functions everything we've seen PC games and IP and all those franchises
6439540	6445680	are more valuable today than they were four or five years ago and he goes on to say later
6445680	6451440	on that we do here's a quote here we do it with our own games if we thought having a
6451440	6457180	75% sale on Portal 2 would cheap in Portal 2 we wouldn't do it we know that there are
6457180	6461960	all kinds of ways customers consume things get value come back build franchises we think
6461960	6469040	lots of these things strengthen it and they said later on that if we some if we were somehow
6469040	6477480	on a cycle yeah they're saying that the based on their 40 million users that they haven't
6477480	6484760	run into the people waiting for stuff to go on sale that they said that if they were seeing
6484760	6487720	people just waiting for stuff to go on sale they definitely wouldn't do it with their
6487720	6492720	own titles but it's their own titles that they put out there first for those super sales
6492720	6498040	because people will still order them they'll still wait for that release date they'll still
6498040	6502780	want it day one because they're fans of it and they like the service and they know that
6502780	6507240	later on there's going to be another good deal with it you know remember when they gave
6507240	6514680	Portal away for free yes free and they conveniently did that not long before Portal 2 came out
6514680	6522160	oh and it was also right in line with the Mac version of Steam so and this one thing
6522160	6527600	that I really liked is that they recognize that there's a user base on Mac that wants
6527600	6533160	to play the games so they're making them available and now we've got them working on Linux so
6533160	6538600	they know people aren't just PC gamers hello you know artists like to play games to that
6538600	6543240	Borderlands game of the year edition for 750 mighty convenient that Borderlands 2 is coming
6543240	6547920	out in September yeah a little bit a little bit which you should pick it up pick up both
6547920	6554200	of them for the lance game of the year three hours left I think I was very very few hours
6554200	6561040	left when I purchased it before the show it might already be done all right a few more
6561040	6564780	stories for you guys and then the mail back oh I'm sorry well the other thing too is that
6564780	6569320	origin is still sitting at number two with 11 million registered users and steam has
6569320	6575480	like I said 40 million and EA is kind of forcing people to register too now to be fair valve
6575480	6579680	did that too in the beginning and people didn't like it but I'm just saying how much of that
6579680	6584480	11 million were people that wanted to sign up for the service or how many are battlefield
6584480	6589080	3 and Mass Effect 3 players had no choice I tell you what I still launched Mass Effect
6589080	6595080	3 through steam because I can do screen caps you have to turn off origin set it to launch
6595080	6600560	independent an independent game and then as it launches it it pulls up origin but you're
6600560	6604680	still playing it through the steam platform so you can do screen caps and I'll use all
6604680	6611040	of the steam goodies a little work around a little bit a few more stories for you guys
6611040	6615340	and then the mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com to send us an email for a future
6615340	6621800	week but first Loki so not to be outdone by the summer of arcade the PlayStation Network
6621800	6627720	has decided to go ahead and launch PlayStation Network play which is kind of like summer
6627720	6632200	of arcade during the month of August they're going to release a bunch of different games
6632200	6636040	that are going to be kind of part of this including and actually I guess it is part
6636040	6641280	of July to July 24th August 27th is when it's going to run there's going to be four games
6641280	6648080	launched on the PlayStation Network papa yo are papo and yo sound shapes counter-strike

6662440	6668920	two games get you three bucks if you buy all four games you get ten dollars and if you're
6668920	6680000	a PlayStation plus member you even get 20% on top of all that so it's kind of cool very
6680000	6687040	cool let's move on to one more story about Richard Garriott he here he is again in our
6687040	6698200	show apparently he has raised seven million dollars for a new iOS game it's a social RPG

6701960	6707160	about at length on the show previously hate that game you hate it because of what happened
6707160	6712640	with it because it's a piece of junk is just absolute crap I mean if you're gonna play
6712640	6718860	absolute crap yeah it's kind of cool to collect like old ass nostalgia stuff but it's a piece
6718860	6727920	of shit game well this new RPG that he's gonna be funding here is called new Britannia very
6727920	6732360	interesting that this comes out the same week as the whole Ultima forever thing cuz what

6737920	6742800	a social RPG we don't know what other ties it will have to Ultima obviously there's you

6802760	6810320	thank you first ones from Jim Sally hey sexies let's say it's sexy Halloween night and your
6810320	6814240	love buddy wants to dress up sexy for you but as your favorite video game character
6814240	6818000	who would you want them to dress up as I would totally go for a night with Tifa from Final
6818000	6824360	Fantasy 7 that shit can knock me out all night let me know XOXO Jim Sally I suppose if I
6824360	6834640	say Kayden that's a little bit too obvious isn't it Garris I don't even know that just
6834640	6839280	doesn't exist in reality with me I mean that was just because the minute he said something
6839280	6843440	about that to his wife the wife would literally point laugh at him I really wouldn't be turned
6843440	6850160	on by that anyway you know not gonna lie I would a little bit I love my husband exactly
6850160	6853720	how he is and I think that dressing up for your significant other is stupid and a waste
6853720	6859360	of money now I dress up for cosplay necessarily if we cosplay together that would be different
6859360	6862320	and then I'd have to pounce him now if you want to pay there's anything wrong with dressing
6862320	6866680	up now now if my significant other would pay for a stripper that was dressed up like somebody
6866680	6879200	then I don't know I still know a hot redhead I don't know pick a hot redhead anyone I don't
6879200	6894840	know thumbs up sure okay so moving on this is from clover and Nikon hi I just wanted
6894840	6900200	to share a picture of what the children watched one day at vacation care it was an episode
6900200	6904600	of the 80s Super Mario Brothers cartoon and we keep up the great show and I will do my
6904600	6910980	best to visit vogue with more CG art and let me take a look at this picture of course it
6910980	6915280	comes up massive on my teeny little screen so I can't it's I did look at the picture
6915280	6919500	earlier and they are in their suit they are obviously watching the whole thing somebody
6919500	6925480	off with the fire finger they are indeed watching the old 80s Mario Brothers cartoon for sure
6925480	6933240	okay oh one great and it's a it's it's something all kids should watch it still gets rerun
6933240	6937400	on like some like little independent networks like nothing like CBS or whatever but if your
6937400	6942000	town has a ton of networks like I think for a while the PAX network remember that I don't
6942000	6944600	think they're called that anymore I think they're ion or something it's like it's mostly
6944600	6950120	god shows but like they would also have like randomly like mama's family reruns which was
6950120	6956080	a great show shut up or Mario Brothers Super Mario Brothers Super Show for a long time
6956080	6964440	so anyhow okay so moving forward um hey OLR it's been a while since I've written but I
6964440	6968960	wanted to extend a long overdue congratulations on the creation of the vogue network as a
6968960	6972600	small business owner myself I understand what a huge undertaking this must have been for
6972600	6977560	you and in such a small amount of time it's truly remarkable accomplishment also I miss
6977560	6981780	my opportunity to congratulate you on your landmark 10-year achievement thank you for
6981780	6985480	all of the laughs and the pure entertainment that you have provided me over the years I've
6985480	6990200	been listening since 2005 well you know what they say better late than never back to the
6990200	6994120	topic of gaming I recently had the pleasure of stumbling upon a fantastic game that I
6994120	6999360	am truly surprised flew completely under the radar this year binary domain for the ps3
6999360	7004760	and 360 it's been one of the most compelling stories of any TPS I've ever played I think
7004760	7011760	of toilet paper though sorry and is complemented by a truly unique cast of characters in visionary
7011760	7016440	world think Blade Runner meets Terminator it's got me thinking of how much there must
7016440	7020160	be hundreds of games every year that come out and are met with little to no publicity
7020160	7024440	or claim that they deserve can each of you think of a game that you have experienced
7024440	7029880	recently that was truly great but really wasn't covered by most of the major game outlets
7029880	7035320	and perhaps even overlooked by most gamers I'm not really referring to games like journey
7035320	7040880	for instance but that that didn't have the marketing blitz but enjoyed a lot of favorable
7040880	7045200	coverage by reviewers something more obscure and more underground if something comes to
7045200	7051800	mind oh I liked fractal that is seem to get a lot of buzz I'm gonna say the cold sept
7051800	7056300	games like cold sept saga on the 360 and I think I've referenced this on the show before
7056300	7060960	but it's kind of like magic the gathering meets monopoly I'm not sure why these games
7060960	7065960	aren't like a bigger deal but I guess maybe it's kind of a niche thing but yeah I really
7065960	7070220	like those games and they don't seem like I I didn't even know the 360 one was coming
7070220	7074680	out but like I saw like a random ass thing somewhere and I was like they're making one
7074680	7078100	but that was several years ago that it came out I'm sure it's near impossible to find
7078100	7086280	a copy of it now no in a way DDR kinda I mean incredible crisis remember how we were all
7086280	7089720	hooked on incredible crisis oh yeah that's old school that's really old school trying
7089720	7097160	to think of like newer stuff yeah imagine party babies rob I found you a copy last night
7097160	7103500	I loved yes thanks for the text I loved lost odyssey and a lot of people wrote that one
7103500	7110680	off and I don't know why no I didn't actually realize that WTF came out oh yeah I know but
7110680	7114360	I guess I wasn't thinking about it cuz I was like oh is it e3 one's gonna pay for this
7114360	7121240	you were asleep yeah I was asleep but I found the copy used easy earth defense force you
7121240	7126040	and your bugs of course it is an awesome game all right seriously 2017 is a lot better than
7126040	7131480	insect armageddon insect armageddon is a more polished game but it didn't sell what they
7131480	7136600	had hoped and because of that the publisher didn't really support it and that's kind of
7136600	7141680	disappointing because the levels are really limited in it but still great game oh and
7141680	7150920	of course president cat yes president cat go into our chat room at chat dot vog network
7150920	7157000	dot com or live dot vog network dot com immortal king says I would have said psychonauts but
7157000	7162720	that game applies acidic vampire says lost odyssey is the real Final Fantasy 13 yeah
7162720	7168640	I went there yep yeah that's cuz Final Fantasy 13 is really Final Fantasy 14 and then 14
7168640	7175480	doesn't exist all right there's more to that email oh I'm sorry I was looking at this binary
7175480	7180360	domain thing I don't know a lot about this game I do it's it was a third-person shooter
7180360	7187240	game that came up from Sega back in February it looked okay it's basically about robots
7187240	7194560	hiding themselves among other humans and starting to kind of take over and so it's basically
7194560	7200320	this like almost like a SEAL team or something like that coming in to solve this invasion
7200320	7208400	of Tokyo from these robots there's another game that was similar that kind of flew under
7208400	7212920	the radar I don't know if it was really good was inversion which had like this gravity
7212920	7217120	shifting mechanic to it and stuff oh yeah some people I knew were going crazy about
7217120	7224400	that one well finish the email sure on a closing note I'd like to give a shameless plug to

7313720	7320360	tree yeah Jamie does all this all to the new listeners your grammar will be hazed yes it
7320360	7325960	will you know that last email that we got had stupendously wonderful grammar one a plus

7331200	7336520	on vogue network we can actually do a gold star email award yeah awarded on vogue network
7336520	7341040	I will reward you for proper grammar good spelling all right well I want to hear my
7341040	7348380	question man I hear that you have started playing Final Fantasy 11 again this is my
7348380	7353520	very first MMO I ever tried and I fell completely in love with this game as already being an
7353520	7360320	FF nut before as life went on and started realizing that this game is such a time sink
7360320	7365060	I left the game and started playing wow something a little less hardcore and time-consuming
7365060	7371120	than Final Fantasy 11 is you think that's less time-consuming okay yes because you don't
7371120	7376280	have the grind I mean you can spend all fucking day and night playing wow but you actually
7376280	7383440	will accomplish something true you have me interested in Final Fantasy 11 once again
7383440	7387320	with some of the changes you have said they have made my question is is there still a
7387320	7393480	good amount of people playing okay I'm gonna fix your grammar are there is still a good
7393480	7400280	amount of people playing is there a lot of downtime LFG or no syllable and still need
7400280	7405960	groups as a former dark knight what would you suggest my starting job be big fan of
7405960	7411560	DPS keep up the good working love you guys Travis okay trying to get some of those questions
7411560	7416420	out of the way is it hard to find a group for leveling no not at all because everything's
7416420	7419840	done in alliances now it's like when you first start the game you're gonna just head over
7419840	7423880	to Gus can mines which I which I know is a foreign thing because it's like no no I go
7423880	7428440	to the dunes and then I go to quefim island nope now you go to Gus can mines the place
7428440	7434320	of the scary silent siren and you do the field manual for skeletons and you can group that
7434320	7438000	all the way to like level 40 and then after that you go to crawler's nest but I mean if
7438000	7442400	you get to level 40 in a couple days you're gonna be so freaking happy as it is you'll
7442400	7446240	you'll kind of figure the rest out are there still a lot of people playing the game depends
7446240	7452520	on your opinion of a lot of people they merge some of the servers some time ago you remember
7452520	7456540	how we used to talk about the ferry server when we were talking the room the old days
7456540	7463200	of all our the answer there is no more fairy server ha ha with the self server which is
7463200	7468100	ironically enough the server that I'm on now which is another type of fairy yes so it's
7468100	7473180	appropriate still the fairy service it's just now you know a different name so I I did a
7473180	7479160	see all slash see all the other day and there were 1080 people online so I'd still call
7479160	7485340	that a fair amount of people now what whereas it's easy to find leveling groups people are
7485340	7489040	still having a hard time finding groups for missions and things like that and you got
7489040	7494040	to find your way into a link shell there's still the Juno shouts and all that stuff and
7494040	7498720	you might be able to find something but you can expect that some of that will still be
7498720	7501600	a little bit of a weight and that's kind of the problems I'm starting to have with it
7501600	7507360	is that whereas the leveling thing is awesome the rest of it's less awesome I probably am
7507360	7510700	not going to renew past this month Shane told me he's not renewing past the month because
7510700	7514440	of other stuff and I'm like I don't want to play by myself and I don't have a link show
7514440	7518620	on there or anything so I'm like I'll just I'll wait and get Guild Wars 2 when it comes
7518620	7527480	out but I like you Thomas 11 wasn't my first MMO but it was the first one I played a lot
7527480	7533320	of and so I played a decent amount of it for a little while I had I brought in a bunch
7533320	7538000	of friends of mine from other forums that I was on to play with us too and like you
7538000	7543760	I quit for a while so I think you know what I didn't quit that for a while Oh remember
7543760	7550640	no no I'm saying like you the emailer I quit for a while yeah I will say this though during
7550640	7555260	that steam sale that we talked earlier about the abyssia edition 12 bucks on steam right
7555260	7564920	now and you get the 30 Loki just lit up no I can't do that it's it's worth checking out
7564920	7571800	you know what go have a flirt go have a kiki with Final Fantasy 11 for 30 days and with
7571800	7578080	your 12 bucks just just goes go see it's worth it I don't need more things to take away time
7578080	7583760	I'm talking to the emailer again all right that's my answer I get I hit all the questions
7583760	7588240	the email I hope I did I think yeah but now we need a Mass Effect MMO is that it for emails
7588240	7593880	yes but Mass Effect give dark Sakura more emails to read make her work mailbag at orange
7593880	7599720	lounge radio.com let's do some angst you know what Rob you're gonna do not do something
7599720	7602840	you're gonna say that one time and I'm gonna have laryngitis and you'll have to read them
7602840	7610000	all I'll make Loki do it or I'll get Alan in here Alan Alan read emails okay let's be
7610000	7632800	pissy F you to my indigestion I mean I didn't really have anything that was unhealthy I
7632800	7644920	had salad had beer and coffee so what's up with that F you to a bunch of well here's
7644920	7652520	the fact that Nellie's car has a screw through the tire so that was fun today putting the
7652520	7661040	donut on take off work tomorrow and get that fixed which will do for free that's not so
7661040	7670800	bad still no that it yeah my a few the week I really don't have anything serious so I
7670800	7675080	guess I have to do something a little more superficial if you did the fact that I didn't
7675080	7678920	get civilization five for Alan on steam when it was eight dollars and now it's up to a
7678920	7688160	whole fourteen dollars what am I gonna do so much money God I could buy another copy
7688160	7694800	of Final Fantasy of this edition or not all right I'm sorry I don't have a better F you
7694800	7699360	but things are going pretty well can't complain all right a few more stories for you guys
7699360	7704720	and then the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or orange lounge radio on Skype
7704720	7712200	and a few more news stories and Twitter twitter.com slash OLR as I mentioned this week we're getting
7712200	7720720	a well we got a Minecraft update awesome one point seven three was the update it added
7720720	7728680	pit stands and sticky pistons and that's pretty awesome cheers which you can now use to collect
7728680	7737080	leaf blocks which don't really work out too well when you're making bushes but you make
7737080	7742640	it work I guess also now they have flint and steel is or redstone is required to detonate
7742640	7747520	TNT because it was annoying when I accidentally dropped TNT on the ground and I had to encase
7747520	7757600	the thing in obsidian so that I wouldn't blow anything up in my my house also they're adding
7757600	7764160	the option for character skins in fact Monday the 16th they're gonna be putting up a pack
7764160	7770800	of character skins with 40 different skins for like 240 Microsoft points which I'll probably
7770800	7778320	buying sets a really good deal and yeah but really skins whatever you don't even see yourself
7778320	7784400	you will see in multiplayer I don't know I think it's a little silly but then again I
7784400	7789380	bought lots of silly crap for Mass Effect so I'm not gonna judge you much it's silly
7789380	7795280	but whatever the thing that is kind of annoying though is apparently the pistons don't work
7795280	7799800	very well in Minecraft if you put too many near each other the game will like out or
7799800	7806120	crash so that is a can't handle the pistons captain it can't and that is that is unfortunate
7806120	7809840	because you can't build some of the stuff that you can on the PC version also there's
7809840	7814360	a new lighting engine that they added in there which looks pretty nice some people don't
7814360	7820600	like it because this is too yellow but I think it looks nice and then of course new textures
7820600	7828200	for some of the objects including cobblestone which I like a lot better it's less garish
7828200	7834600	I guess and then also you're gonna be getting some free stuff Rob if you don't like buying
7834600	7842600	now you're speaking my language on July 18th you'll be able to get a customized summer
7842600	7851200	arcade skin pack with five skins in that as well as also if you don't have Minecraft or
7851200	7856000	you want to get some stuff for trials evolution you can get new themed tracks they're gonna
7856000	7865240	be once a week alongside each new game so that's kind of cool very cool and then pro
7865240	7873760	skater HD's coming out this was it next week so that could be pretty cool chiggers in our
7873760	7877840	chat room at live dot vog network dot com says someone should build castle grayskull
7877840	7883080	in Minecraft surely that's happened I'm sure it's happened remember everything if you can
7883080	7893680	dream it it's probably happening on the internet right now I like it up even let's move on
7893680	7901640	to one more news story tonight officially and that is about game movies yay god of war
7901640	7905440	still supposed to happen still supposed to become a movie at some point the screenplay
7905440	7912160	is being rewritten by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan don't recognize those names well you
7912160	7917240	should pay attention to the credits of saw four five and six because that's the other
7917240	7923160	movies they wrote goody goody because those were real winners ask me and to go completely
7923160	7926800	off topic yes there's multiple pictures of castle grayskull in Minecraft so it's been
7926800	7932600	done multiple times damn you Loki Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan have also written
7932600	7942780	such horror film classics as feast feast to sloppy seconds and feast three the happy finish
7942780	7948040	they will be writing the god of war movie what about fees for the feasting then again
7948040	7952520	does the god of war movie really need dialogue when it needs tits and violence I mean that's
7952520	7961560	that's really what we're looking for and certainly the softball someone to yell you know I really
7961560	7966000	hate the saw movies you guys I really hate them I miss the last one and I have seen the
7966000	7970120	rest of them but I miss the last one cuz you got it you kind of have to see them all if
7970120	7974720	you've already watched that many I would rather see this movie at this point this is also
7974720	7979960	not my kind of movie need for speed don't get me wrong I like the games but I'm not
7979960	7991080	a big race car movie fan I'm not like the fast and furious stuff February 7th 2014 is
7991080	7995120	when the need for speed film is coming out that's amazing considering they haven't shot
7995120	8000360	any film yet but I guess they're fast tracking it it's going to be directed by an ex stunt
8000360	8005320	man which I find interesting it's not based on a specific game in the series it's just
8005320	8009040	need for speed on a racing move I think it should just be based off the run because that
8009040	8013600	was that actually had a plot there will be cars and explosions and that's all you want
8013600	8021800	and hopefully tits and violence and there is maybe there'll be a cross-promotion there
8021800	8028520	God of War racing tighter Klein chat says now the question is is the God of War movie
8028520	8033520	gonna be pg-13 or our chance with those people it'll be a hard R given their connections
8033520	8044040	with saw yeah I'm with you it's probably gonna be a hard R or a fuzzy nc-17 because remember
8044040	8051280	violence is okay decapitations that's fine torture porn a-okay you're a hard R but how
8051280	8062200	if you showed penis or vagina your nc-17 sorry really it's nc-17 if it's male you know anatomy
8062200	8066840	being shown well if you want to get tech I don't really care about anyone else's we if
8066840	8073560	you want to get technical you can show a lady's pubes and you can kind of show like the general
8073560	8079120	thing from far back like you know oh I know what that is but if like the minute a labia
8079120	8089680	shows up or is identifiable now it's nc-17 the more you know okay by the way to ask when
8089680	8096360	anyone asked about doing the castle of lions someone actually did Voltron in Minecraft
8096360	8106800	just saying there's a check box that says labia it's like labia check does your movie
8106800	8117320	contain any of the following decapitations the usage of the word fuck labia 1877 game

8405820	8409920	on it for only 12 bucks and i was i was definitely on the steam today and i was like oh yeah
8409920	8414260	there it is 12 so i'm probably gonna get back on and jump back on it and just test it out
8414260	8418080	again and i am i am another one that's waiting for gold wars 2 to come out so i'm excited
8418080	8422240	about that as well it's a great and it works perfectly because if you start now your 30
8422240	8427880	day trial will be up like the week before guild wars 2 is out exactly now here's a question
8427880	8434240	for you did you ever play final fantasy 14 i never did no just it's better left into
8434240	8440000	your imagination it's it's not pretty they should have just made 11 with high definition
8440000	8446040	graphics and they didn't do that they made they made something a lot sadder sadly i'll
8446040	8449600	be honest with you and i was i was so excited about once i heard about it because i was
8449600	8453480	like oh wow another mmo from final fantasy and then all of a sudden i heard about how

8466480	8469820	from world of warcraft and stuff and i didn't see any of that like i saw that they were
8469820	8473960	trying to do some of the like 60 minute you know things you could do in more bite sizes
8473960	8479320	that you do in final fantasy 11 and i i respect them for that but final fantasy 11 implemented

8534840	8541600	for real they're not that smelly i'm gonna start a kickstarter to make how about we go
8541600	8547560	to another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this uh this is mourmet but i'm
8547560	8552640	not in chat right now i'm using uh i'm using the iphone right now that's all right oh i
8552640	8556880	see you can you know in the iphone you can't you got to just use the phone part that's
8556880	8563400	all right what's up buddy um i was just wanting to talk about the uh the whole import issue
8563400	8571840	that was going on uh last week uh with the final fantasy uh get rid of and uh i guess
8571840	8580780	the also the um persona arena and how everybody felt about it well yeah i was gonna say the
8580780	8586840	import issue is specifically about persona am i right because there's the whole uh issue
8586840	8595320	where it's he hung up you don't want to talk to us anymore what happened he just hung up
8595320	8601480	bad signal user error no maybe that maybe he death gripped the iphone i don't know what
8601480	8606280	happened um yeah because i think there's an issue with the rhythm sense the rhythm is
8606280	8610380	a region lock game anyways and that's kind of a region lock system it was just that this
8610380	8616280	is a region free system that has its first region locked game which is a little odd well
8616280	8620080	i'm gonna see if that number comes back through because i you know i want to know a little
8620080	8623480	more about like what his perspective was on that because i kind of think we got it out
8623480	8627680	there in the open last week that well we never did resolve the theater of the thing but you
8627680	8631440	know obviously we have the different opinions on that and then as far as the persona games
8631440	8635980	go you know we didn't see the point for getting really upset about it because they are putting
8635980	8640560	out the exact same game in both regions i only get pissed about region locking when
8640560	8646920	japan gets these games that either we never get or like take president cat was a perfect
8646920	8653320	example it was this whimsical silly game that you know they should have really made it here
8653320	8657400	and why can't i import it if they're never going to release it ever ever maybe it would
8657400	8663480	have sold better i don't know they bring a lot of weird stuff over here i'm surprised
8663480	8667880	that that never did come over here all right well since the number is not calling back
8667880	8671120	so i'll say this much since your chat connect or since your phone connection isn't working
8671120	8676000	out too well get in chat and tell us the rest of the question there or what your perspective
8676000	8681920	is on that so we can better answer it would be great 1877 game olr or a username on skype
8681920	8685340	is orange lounge radio i have a couple other quick stories i want to work in here because
8685340	8689320	they're from twitter tiger claw tweeted us a few stories and bobby was talking to me
8689320	8694720	about this one too and i think this is pretty interesting in dark sakura pay attention universal
8694720	8700080	studios in konami are partnering uh universal studios and i'm not talking about the movie
8700080	8703380	studio i'm talking about the amusement park you know there's one in orlando there's one
8703380	8710280	here in la they are teaming up together for halloween horror nights and apparently silent
8710280	8717360	hill is going to be getting a replica at this year's halloween horror nights that is going
8717360	8724440	to be this october at both the hollywood and orlando parks ooh wait when uh just for halloween
8724440	8729260	october yeah they do something like all month long because um if i go down for disneyland
8729260	8734120	that means i'll be down in the area yes our other friends adrian and gabe who don't listen
8734120	8739080	to this show but they go they always take a day and not go to disneyland but they go
8739080	8744560	to uh universal studios so you should think about doing something similar and go to silent
8744560	8749560	hill i've never been to universal studios please don't get killed by pyramid head okay
8749560	8752680	or at least give them a hug i'll hump them that same number is calling back so i want
8752680	8757880	to try and get back to the phone hi you there yes i'm sorry about that i think i got the
8757880	8762960	iphone yeah see i called it i called it all right so what what was it you wanted to say
8762960	8766640	about it i mean do you do you have perspective on it or were you looking for our perspective
8766640	8772920	or what's your opinion on the whole region locking okay well i um pick i'm i normally
8772920	8777520	pick up uh import games on the regular and i picked up get rid of them back in uh february
8777520	8784080	and march and uh it was great and i also was you know was about to pick up a sonar arena
8784080	8788360	when i until i found out that they were going to region lock it only because i didn't buy
8788360	8794160	the ps3 in japan because it was you know what the region locks but this issue really doesn't
8794160	8802160	have anything to do with um but america this is more like japan i think afraid of um you
8802160	8806960	know japanese people start buying their games because you know i tend to you know play a
8806960	8812120	lot of japanese rpgs i've to the point i can i can read japanese pretty pretty effectively
8812120	8816560	online and and you know i kind of even like you know help out with the little team that
8816560	8821360	they're that they have especially with the tails game so um i just wanted to just you
8821360	8828000	know let people know that if you really want to like you know play like any employee games
8828000	8833280	you know the prices for us won't really change and this is really for japan this is really
8833280	8838640	for like maybe having japan have you know cheaper prices but not but the people that
8838640	8843720	buy games out there don't really you know pay too much attention to you know the you
8843720	8848160	know the gaming environment here in america it's a whole different environment over there
8848160	8853680	you know people sure i mean like games are always 100 ps3 games or uh i think theater
8853680	8859120	with them with eighty dollars sure and i remember hearing a lot about that that the uh finances
8859120	8864640	was it was maybe more region locked to protect the japanese version of the game because it
8864640	8867560	was going to be more expensive and people were legit worried that they were just going
8867560	8873140	to be importing copies from america let me ask you this though from a consumer perspective
8873140	8879160	or the gamer perspective you and i and especially somebody like you who plays a lot of import
8879160	8884160	games and you know definitely i'm sure cares about retaining some of that original japanese
8884160	8888420	atmosphere as i understand that persona is going to be the exact same game in both regions
8888420	8892400	right so from our perspective we're getting a good end of the deal here it's okay that
8892400	8899080	it's region locked right right it's okay because i believe it's coming out for um america i
8899080	8904180	think within two weeks of the uh the release of the japanese one you're right you're right
8904180	8909520	yes so you know i don't you know i just i don't think the body block will will show
8909520	8914160	as well a conflict over two years so i i think i assumed that you kind of believe what bobby
8914160	8920120	was saying and uh his friend you know about him i was going to boycott bears and i don't
8920120	8925280	know i always find it there that i just really thought people need to just relax it isn't
8925280	8929720	too much of a problem i think this is a big you know scam problem you know because when
8929720	8934720	they have their very decent amount you know they literally you know devices i think power
8934720	8940600	freddy 13 and i bought it uh just from japan like 115 dollars no joke then like two weeks
8940600	8945240	later because people had a problem with it it dropped to like 50 dollars yeah it's like
8945240	8951560	this is like in japan imports they were like change their prices um the websites but in
8951560	8956440	japan that's how it was i don't want to speak for bobby because i'm not bobby but i believe
8956440	8961240	his perspective was pretty similar to ours where i he did not i think he really didn't
8961240	8966680	understand why people the consumers were getting so upset about the region locking because
8966680	8971560	it was the same game coming out in both regions and you know and they they had taken the extra
8971560	8976160	step to preserve the japanese language track even because they know the target audience
8976160	8979640	for these types of games usually tends to overlap a lot with the same type of people
8979640	8983700	that are really into japanese culture so he wasn't understanding why people were getting
8983700	8987600	so upset about it i think he kind of saw it from the same perspective we're getting at
8987600	8993080	now i don't know about the callers yeah and he does he just clarified in chat i have no
8993080	8999720	problem with the region locking of persona 4 for the record okay so if the games continue
8999720	9005720	to come out like that uh i guess america wouldn't really see much of a problem now is that what
9005720	9011200	you're saying yes i'll tell yeah as far as i know yes as long as it's the same game it's
9011200	9015040	fine and as long as it's kind of like that same window and so forth it's totally fine
9015040	9020960	i'll give you an example of what pisses me off the way xenoblade was handled that pissed me off
9020960	9026640	that was a terrible thing that they did because that was a great game they released in japan you
9026640	9032080	know on the we right and then it comes out in europe and they have that version and then we have
9032080	9038080	to wait six months after that which that's not even the part that really bothers me because
9038080	9042640	europe sometimes gets that end of the shaft it kind of works in reverse so that part doesn't
9042640	9048880	really bother me but a the wheeze region lock so i can't really import it and b when they end up
9048880	9055760	releasing it here it's a fucking game stop exclusive that pissed me off exactly yeah see
9055760	9062720	that this is this is what uh i really think is gonna be the next um issue for like gamers that
9062720	9068000	are come back and play games here in america or in europe or in japan because now our world are
9068000	9072800	being flattened and now we can actually see a little bit more and more people are buying it
9072800	9078320	i really feel like you know a consumer that wanted to play xenoblade would have found the way to play
9078320	9083040	whether they would import it or pirated it they would have found their way of playing it so like
9083040	9089120	so for them to wait six months only hurts them because i don't even walk into a game stop anymore
9089120	9093120	you know i only i'd when i want to go ahead and buy it you know any different game top if you
9093120	9098080	were to buy a console that's reason lock or if there's a particular reason and you like a cable
9098080	9103440	or something but anything you know i think the average employee gamer it's kind of like savvy
9103440	9110320	enough to buy games online on other ways like like the kavita like the new hux unique look
9110320	9115120	would be coming out here like it there's a military simulation game people like it but it
9115120	9119360	may not come out here for a while but you know whoever likes you know those games can now can
9119360	9124640	download them from the uh i believe they can buy them from the playstation store if they buy
9124640	9131680	japanese beta which makes it great because it kind of bypasses the import problem so i i just i just
9131680	9135920	think we're going to see this more often more you know as time goes on it's going to be great because
9135920	9141520	you know uh i think that some of the games that are actually coming out you can play them even
9141520	9148080	if you don't know any japanese you know for instance i think you and i are on similar pages
9148080	9153200	i think if if um you know project diva and all that was on the same page as persona 4 and the
9153200	9157920	way they're doing it region locking wouldn't bug me whatsoever but unfortunately you know you got
9157920	9164880	to remember the roots of this show we were hardcore ddr and beatmania fans and for so long konami's
9164880	9172080	putting out all these great beatmania 2dx mixes in japan and then they put one out here that sure
9172080	9175840	it's got a better controller slightly because they've had some time to perfect it but then the
9175840	9181360	the song list itself and there really ain't shit you can do about it on the playstation
9181360	9188800	too but get a japanese playstation too it's crazy all right well thanks so much for the call buddy
9188800	9193040	i gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show but uh i think we're on the same page with region
9193040	9197840	stuff i appreciate you uh sharing your perspective on that all right no problem thank you take care
