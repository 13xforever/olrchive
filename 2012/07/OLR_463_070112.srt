Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, July 1st, 2012, a full-time anime channel is console-bound,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
a classic edutainment title is set to become a movie, and one gaming company turns 40 years old.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello, my friends out there on the Internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
where every gamer has a voice here at Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We are live as we are every Sunday night at VOG Network, or the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGNetwork.com.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about gaming,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and have some LOLs, and start 10 more years of the fun with my co-host.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Say hello first off to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Loki has curly fries.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know, he always brings such yummy food and then waves it in front of us.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I think that he should give me one.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
May I please have a curly fry?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Techmaster Loki here tonight, what do you say?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Aww, he's handing one over.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They gave me small and a medium because they were out of large boxes.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So is that like Jack in the Box math? Small plus medium equals large?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh my god, Grease.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Grease is truly the word.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Joining us tonight, we have a special guest, somebody who hasn't been on the show in a while,

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but he's no stranger to OLR, but maybe some of you haven't heard him before.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Say hello to Alan!

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How are you doing?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm doing great.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Awesome. Now you're on the wonky mic tonight, I might have to have you switch out,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
because I've already heard some little crackle-shreckle.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So yeah, chat, if I sound like crap, let us know. Don't let me go through the whole show like this.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or pretend he's a robot.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There you go. How are you doing?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm good.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's new with you since you were on the show last? I don't even remember when you were actually on the show.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, you've made cameo appearances, like one or two lines.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll be in the office playing a game and then I will run out into the living room and just shout something

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
that's relevant to the show when I'm not even on the show.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Does this microphone work?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not even plugged in. It's muted.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I understand that, but would it work if you were plugged in?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, in fact, the hissing is still happening, so I'm going to ask Alan to switch out the mic he's using

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and pick up that other one instead. Let me actually mute that.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Live radio.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The choice of live radio at vognetwork.com.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, try again.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right, you're just going to be a little quiet, so be sure you talk good and loud.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll turn up your gain a little bit and I'll hopefully help.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Did you say you were going to turn up the gay a little bit?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, the game.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, girl. Welcome to Orange Town Radio. What do?

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Stop. So I got a job in early May that has me working nights.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I work in a call center because it's an election year doing political surveys,

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and usually when OLR is taping for the last month and a half, I've been at work.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I get home at like 10 o'clock or like 930 when the show's wrapping up.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, I got a little promotion, so I'm going to have later hours,

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but hopefully that doesn't start until next week.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So here I am, taking advantage.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So here you are taking advantage of the week off, I should say, that you have.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So welcome. All right, well, we are going to get in, of course, to all the news this week,

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
or lack thereof. Is it just me or was it really kind of a slow news week?

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I mean, when people are reporting on Twitter, that's usually an indication it's a slow week.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've been in a Normandy-shaped bubble all week, so I haven't cared.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, it sounds like we need to get to gaming weeks, but first, before we get to gaming weeks

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and the obvious game that Dark Soccer has been playing, I always like to do kind of a kickoff topic,

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and I've got to start with this one tonight.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And I want to talk about what it means, and those that have seen the FUGL Question of the Week,

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
which I'm going to read in Part B in a little bit, kind of know about this already,

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but I wanted to talk a little bit about what it means to be a real gamer.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to read a conversation I was having with somebody online.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now, I don't know this person super, super well, but they're a gamer and I'm a gamer,

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and I was kind of trying to figure out, like, okay, maybe there's a multiplayer game we play in common or whatever.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I'm going to read this conversation that we have, and I want you guys to tell me what you think.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So he asked me, what games are you playing?

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I said, I've been stupid addicted to Mass Effect 3.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's the first multiplayer game in a long time I can stand to play with strangers.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I just got into the whole series like three months ago, played all three games back to back.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And he replies, is that a first-person shooter?

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And I replied, it looks like one, but it doesn't really play like one.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
On the easiest difficulty, your team does all the work for you.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I play a class that's more of a magic user, so I hang back.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You know, I'm trying to kind of like put it in RPG terms.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So I hang back and blast everything.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's got a really strong story.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I call it more of an RPG with FPS elements.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Now, before you guys correct me that Mass Effect isn't truly a first-person shooter.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a third-person shooter.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm aware of this, but it has FPS elements.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's the key word.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
As in it doesn't make Jamie motion sick.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Or, you know, when it's sniper rifle, it's first-person.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But it does, especially when you're playing multiplayer, it kind of feels like it's got a lot of that Halo-esque vibe to it.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But it's different.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I really, really like it.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But here's the reply I got.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Eh, first-person shooters aren't real games, and the people who play them are not real gamers.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No offense.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Those are fighting words.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hold on.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It gets better.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I replied, LOL, there's a big difference between Battlefield or Modern Warfare and Mass Effect.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Trust me.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No offense taken.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I know I'm a true gamer.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Happy face.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And the reply, LOL, if you say so.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I just feel fighting and first-person shooter games require no thought at all.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, yeah.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
LOL.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The amount of side-eye at this table right now, we're all just like, really?

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ask any of the people who play in the Street Fighter tournaments and how they obsess over their technique.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I was just really taken aback.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, anyway, I replied back.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I said, you know, I'm trying to be nice, but at this point I'm like, dude, what are you smoking?

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So I'm like, fighting games is a pretty broad category.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm not very good at a lot of the modern ones.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But in some ways, combat on the 2600 is a fighting game.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like, I'm kind of trying to say, like, dude, you're being ignorant right now.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I asked back, I said, so, what does make a real gamer?

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No reply.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Of course.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is this someone I know?

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, no, this is people online.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You don't understand that you've been trolled.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No, I don't think so.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think this person was very legitimate in their thinking.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I'm just, I was really surprised at how offended I was at that initial comment.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Like, that first person shooter players are not real gamers.

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't play first person shooters a lot.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I mean, but I've played Quake.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I've played Doom.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've played, you know.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Honestly, though, that argument that first person shooters and fighting game players are not real gamers is like saying people of color are not real people.

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I mean, it's just, seriously, that's how ignorant that statement is.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, well.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean, it is.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I mean, seriously, it's like, oh, I'm sorry.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
These are games.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now, if he said casual game, like, you know, if they play Farmville, then yes, I might be able to side with that.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Dictionary.com.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Gamer.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A person who plays games, especially computer or video games.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The end.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you play games on your computer?

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, I was actually playing a couple earlier today.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you play games on a console?

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But Jamie, one of them was a first person shooter.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
According to the dictionary, a gamer is one who plays games.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And you know, I played a fighting game before.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm just trying to imagine this person, like, playing Civ 2 or Civ 3 blindfolded, like, with pins going into his body because the pain, like, brings him closer to the experience.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So what kind of games does this person play?

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have no idea.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I tried.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I asked.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't get a reply.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think this person gave up.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because I'm just, you know.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Clearly I'm ignorant.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Clearly I'm an idiot.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's really all games out there have some sort of, you know, strategy or actual skill involvement.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, except for, like, you know, pure random luck games like, you know, gambling a slot machine.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There's no sort of skill there.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But, um, so it's kind of stupid to say, oh, well, they're not really gamers.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, I understand that, yeah, you can get a lot of people button mashing first person shooters and, you know, fighting games.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But you can do the same.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You can button mash through fucking.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay.

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Merriam-Webster dictionary.

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Gamer.

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
A player who is game, especially an athlete who relishes competition.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Two.

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
A person who plays games, especially a person who regularly plays computer or video games.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Merriam-Webster.

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Now I'm going to try, um, what's the other one?

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Webster.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's go to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate live here with our show.

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And you can check in if you're listening live at vognetwork.com and get your points.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I'm going to talk about check-ins in a little bit, but we've still got some ground to cover.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So reading from chat, I want to start with Burr tonight because this comment that he says here is it for me.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's hitting the nail on the head.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Burr says, you're not a real gamer unless you only play what I play.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And that's, I think, exactly where this guy is at.

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And I'm going to guess, he didn't answer my question.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He's had a day and a half to answer and he's not answered.

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I would guess a real gamer is one that plays Final Fantasy and, you know, RPGs.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because I really wanted to counter that with, oh, so you're into Oblivion?

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Because there's something about that whole East versus West RPG thing.

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And I bet this guy would have been like, no, Oblivion's a first person shooter.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But like, I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Not really, but I'm going to kill you with words.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, he's wrong anyway.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He is, he is.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We have a dictionary definition, one who plays games.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And I would even expand on that, that there's tabletop gamers, you know?

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We used to say, you know, when we talk about going to a tabletop game, we say we're going to game.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean, so it's the same thing.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A gamer is one who plays games.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
AcidicVampire in our chat room says, seriously, tell that guy to play Bioshock and then we'll talk.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There's a really good example of a first person shooter that's like definitely not Modern Warfare, Battlefield.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Or Portal.

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh yeah, Portal's a great, I mean, Portal, Portal.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And that actually doesn't make me motion sick.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Portal is an amazing first person shooter, if you think about it.

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, this is also exactly like, you know, you're not a real sports, you're not a sports fan.

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You know, if you like hockey or soccer, you know.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Football!

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Football!

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Real football.

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Football.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm calling it soccer because I'm American.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I can do that.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I can be ignorant like that.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But we all know what I'm talking about.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, so this guy is obviously often La La Land whatever.

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There's a reason why I bring it up on the show, though, is because what is it about this gaming culture

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
where we're so quick to judge other people and exclude them?

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I'm going to give you an example.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Going to our chat room, GameGuru says,

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The casual games are just extensions of genres from gaming's past.

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
For example, Bejeweled is a puzzle game like Tetris.

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So GameGuru brought up casual games, to which I say, all right, then Facebook games.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sims? They're kind of sims?

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Would somebody that plays The Sims Social and Cityville and Price is Right slots, is that a gamer?

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The slots, no, because it's a slot machine type thing.

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Isn't that a game?

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is how I look at it.

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You have a gamer as a blanket, and then you have types of gamers.

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You have casual gamers.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You have your RPG gamers.

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You have your tabletop gamers, like I said earlier.

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You've got your board gamers.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
One who plays a game is a gamer.

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It just depends on what they like.

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But why do people feel the need, then, to assert that their way is the only way?

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because Catholics are like that, too.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No, no, no, I'm going somewhere with this.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's like religion and politics.

245
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The Catholics think their way is the only way.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm using a blanket term.

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The Southern Baptists, of course, think everyone else is going to hell.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's that type of mentality.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's we are better than you because you don't think the way that we do.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You have the libertarians.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, Lord, let's not go with the libertarians.

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You have the socialists.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You've got Republicans, Democrats.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Everyone thinks that their way is the best,

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and anyone who is not in their group is immediately inferior

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
because they're not in that group.

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Alan?

258
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My theory is he's insecure.

259
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He's caught shit for the games that he's played before.

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He now has a support group, and he's old enough to play the games

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that he likes to play where he doesn't give a fuck,

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and he doesn't catch shit for it anymore,

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
but because he's built that support group of these are the games I play,

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
these are where my friends are, he's still got that insecurity.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He only wants to relate to people that play the same stuff as him.

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's actually a fascinating way to look at it

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because you're essentially saying the reason why he's like that

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
is because it happened to him in reverse.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's essentially what you're saying, right?

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah. He's insecure, and he's got some lingering issues.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I can see that.

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He's caught shit for playing the games that he likes to play,

273
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
but now he's fine, but that's still his safe space.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I could totally see that because back when it was all about

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Dance Dance Revolution for us and so forth,

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
there were people that said all they talk about is DDR.

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's not a video game show. It's a DDR rave lights show.

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Lights don't come through radio.

279
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And I know that you love this game, so this is a bad example,

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but think back when you were crazy about DDR,

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and someone was like, oh, I love music rhythm games.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And you're like, what? And they say, Parappa?

283
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And you're all, hm. Okay.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He plays Parappa, guys! Ha ha ha!

285
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, here's a good example.

286
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In the Groove.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna fan those plays.

288
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, but In the Groove was actually...

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, In the Groove was fine.

290
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm not even gonna go there. Just walk away.

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Porkchop in chat asks, Sky, is this guy young or old?

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's a bit of a juvenile opinion. Mid-20s.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, it's kind of mid-20s. Especially nowadays, with, you know...

294
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Nowadays, those whippersnaps!

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Basically, a lot of the people I interact with on forums

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
that are of the teenage age range

297
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
are pretty immature, and I can imagine that they,

298
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
unless they finally grow up,

299
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that they kind of continue to go that way through their mid-20s.

300
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's like everybody's a decade behind nowadays.

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Well, I think at the end of the day, if you guys are going to, you know,

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
judge other people based on the games they play,

303
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
just kind of, you know, watch yourself.

304
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Watch yourself, because we're creating this cycle, right,

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
where now, you know, that person that we point our fingers at

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
will turn around and do it to somebody else.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's like we should try to be more inclusive, right?

308
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Am I being too much of a hippie?

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're old enough to be thoroughly over it,

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
so you just don't understand why people just won't let shit go.

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Well, and also, maybe it's just that, I mean, this, this, let me also say this.

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
This guy that I was talking to...

313
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Is he from Grindr? You can tell your boyfriend.

314
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is he from Grindr?

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

316
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So, well, you know about how, you know, we're trying to meet, you know,

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
other gamers, right, that we can hang out with locally and things like that.

318
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So I got excited, like, oh, this is another gamer.

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But now I'm like, I don't want to meet this guy because he's an idiot.

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah.

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Well, also, you know, you mentioned the age group,

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and I'm going to tell you something.

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This is going into a little bit of biology and psychology, okay?

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
When a person is in their 20s, and this is like, for women it's like around 25,

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and for guys it's around 27, the brain is still forming.

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I mean, literally, it is actually.

327
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So the mind is more focused on immediate reward as opposed to long-term consequence.

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So this person...

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Bow chicka wow wow.

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So this person is in the mindset where everything is right now,

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
everything is immediate.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You don't like what I like, so I don't care about what you like.

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What's in front of me is what's important to me.

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And, you know, I'm sure that all of us understand that once you hit your 30s,

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
you kind of don't give a crap about that kind of drama anymore.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So it's not as important.

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I guarantee you, this person, when he's in his 30s, is going to say,

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
man, I was stupid.

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's like pulling up your live journal from six years ago and going, oh.

340
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, God, I did that.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I wanted to go back in time and shoot myself.

342
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
All right.

343
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Look, we've got to move on with the show.

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I just, you know, I was so struck by that conversation.

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I was just like, oh, my God, I've got to bring it up on OLR.

346
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And the one thing I didn't want to say, when I was talking to that guy,

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
he did not know that I did this show, like that I've been doing it and so forth

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and where I'm coming from.

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But it's, I don't know, it's kind of funny.

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It pays to do your research, individual.

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Facebook stalk me next time.

352
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
All right.

353
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Moving on.

354
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks, because we're all gamers here at OLR

355
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and so are you guys in our chat room.

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And if you're listening to this on the podcast feed,

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
you must enjoy video games enough that you want to hear a bunch of strangers

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
online talk about it.

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And DDR dollar bill, I can't go back in time and shoot myself

360
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
because I wouldn't be here.

361
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So maybe I'd just smack myself around

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and then use that little Men in Black thing to make me forget.

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You would have to be a looper in order to do that.

364
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All right.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Gaming week, star soccer, why don't you start us off.

366
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You said something about being holed up in the Normandy?

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, I was hanging out in the life support room and in the battery.

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So were you getting it on with Dr.

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Chalk was, because that's what I've always wanted to know.

370
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But it's funny when you go drinking with her

371
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and she starts doing the whole dancing thing is pretty funny.

372
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Black Wolf in our chat room says Garris isn't a gamer.

373
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I bet he plays some games.

374
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
All right, moving on.

375
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But yeah, I've been playing.

376
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I started Mass Effect 2 last weekend and I'm at the last set of missions now.

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So I haven't beaten a game that had that much stuff in it that quickly

378
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
since Final Fantasy six or three when it was out.

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So that's saying something.

380
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, I take that back.

381
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I played do prison pretty quickly.

382
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So and the DLC is all it's all really good, right?

383
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
They're all enjoyable.

384
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh, hell yeah.

385
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And yeah, they were saying that the overlord one was supposed to be like two and a half out.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You said it was like two and a half hours.

387
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know.

388
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That was somebody else in the Senate.

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But I finished it like an hour.

390
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And I just rushed.

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But the story's good.

393
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And the ending is, you know, yeah.

394
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Creepy and scary.

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And yeah, that one.

396
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, my God.

397
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I felt so bad for I mean, it's like it really sucks you in emotionally.

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So you care about the characters.

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And I was like, oh, my God, why don't you just shoot this guy in the face?

400
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So, yeah, I totally, totally.

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I took Samara, by the way.

402
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Not Morant because Morant was a bitch, which is the right thing to do.

403
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's be real.

404
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

405
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But I have seen the Morant seduction scene.

406
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And that was pretty funny because dude, Shep is just stupid.

407
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Bad voice acting.

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But I'm totally going after Garrus.

410
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But I have a save file to where I can go back for Thane if I wanted to.

411
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The end.

412
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So now I have to go by Mass Effect 3 tomorrow.

413
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Mass Effect, Mass Effect, more Mass Effect.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Loki.

415
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I did play some WoW for five minutes.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You got to get use out of that annual pass.

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, well, I logged in so I wouldn't get kicked out of the guild.

418
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Actually, I'm switching it up because I know Loki's about to go on a rant.

419
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So let's go to, let's go to Alan first.

420
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Alan, how was your gaming week?

421
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It was alright.

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I checked in on my Minecraft world.

423
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I have an article that I need to finish for VOG about Minecraft.

424
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm playing in survival mode.

425
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I finally found a world that has a terrain that I like.

426
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And I'm playing on survival mode where you have to eat and there's supposed to be monsters,

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
but I have it on peaceful.

428
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And I thought, I'm going to play it on peaceful until I find a good cave and I build my house.

429
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But I'm so into the exploration and creativity that every time I flip it from survival to easy

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
so that the monsters will spawn, they just irritate me.

431
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's not like I'm afraid of dying.

432
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's like I'm trying to build an expansion in my house.

433
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Fucking go away, creeper.

434
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I just turn the monsters off.

435
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So maybe the whole combat aspect of Minecraft isn't for me.

436
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't know.

437
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

438
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm trying to unlock all the characters.

439
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I've been working on my dude, Paragon, Mass Effect 3

440
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because I've already seen my femshep renegade ending a couple weeks ago.

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I checked out Dragon Age 2 to see how long I had spent on it

442
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
because I haven't touched that game since February.

443
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And I had spent 14 hours and I deleted the save so I could start over

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
because I don't remember a goddamn thing.

445
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And that's it. Those are my three games.

446
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Alright.

447
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Can I talk about how I obtained Mass Effect 3?

448
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah, actually.

449
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because it was legal, but it was one of those like, hmm...

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I think Loki might remember this story, but a couple months ago

451
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
when Battlefield 3 came out, there was this scandal

452
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
where people had bought codes from overseas

453
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
like the China edition of a code for cheap.

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And EA wanted to disable the codes. Something like that.

455
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't remember that.

456
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay.

457
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Well, I was trying to price hunt Mass Effect 3 for Origin

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
thinking that maybe Amazon or Best Buy or something had a code.

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So I went to Google Shopping and I just said,

460
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Mass Effect 3 sale, Origin code, and I found a site

461
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
and I'm not going to say what site it is

462
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
because I don't want it to sound like that OLR is endorsing this.

463
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But you just told everyone how to find it.

464
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Sorry.

465
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Well, there's three or four sites like this

466
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
and I picked the best looking one.

467
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
We're not endorsing it. That's all we need to say.

468
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
So I found a site that had a Mass Effect 3 Origin code

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
for like 22 bucks, which is a huge steal.

470
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And they took PayPal and I've had good experiences before

471
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
using PayPal on eBay where it was a fraud and I got my money back.

472
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It takes two weeks, but I was like, all right.

473
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If this is a scam, it's through PayPal.

474
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I had a reasonable expectation of being safe.

475
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I get the code within a minute of submitting it

476
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and it's a little PNG file.

477
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's literally a scan of the code that you get on the back of the jewel case

478
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
if you bought it.

479
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I put it into Origin and it worked fine.

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And then in Origin it says, Mass Effect 3 Standard Edition US slash UK slash RU.

481
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So it's some like European code.

482
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So this site just bought a bunch of overseas codes in bulk.

483
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I didn't have a problem with it.

484
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Or picked them up out of a box that fell off a truck.

485
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah.

486
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Well, actually, it depends on how the DLC codes out to the retailers

487
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
because there's been times, and I still have hundreds of them left,

488
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
that they will send you an Excel sheet with codes listed.

489
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You guys have X amount of copies that you've ordered from this company.

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Here's the codes for your PS3 copies.

491
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Here's the codes for your 360 copies.

492
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Some of those may be going to rental stores or libraries

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
or people that don't need the DLC codes.

494
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
And so there's a bunch of excess left over.

495
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Now, I don't know about the ones that would be included in a package or whatever,

496
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
but a lot of that stuff that goes to GameStop

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
or even small mom and pop retailers,

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
there could be a bunch of that stuff lying around out there

499
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
because people didn't need them.

500
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So I can play multiplayer fine on the official EA servers.

501
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm not worried about the SWAT team repelling down and crashing through the windows

502
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
or Origin spontaneously just turning off my Mass Effect 3.

503
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
But yeah, I took a risk on one of these sites and spent $22 for a $59 game.

504
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I'm not saying I would do it again, but I didn't have a bad experience.

505
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It worked out fine for me.

506
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Interesting. See, I'm trying to figure out where to...

507
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
When I showed you the site, because you're considering getting Mass Effect 3 for PC

508
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
so that you could play with me...

509
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Which I ended up getting through Best Buy when they had a sale.

510
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And you looked at the site and you're like,

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
honey, this looks shady as fuck.

512
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
And I was like, well, I did Google the name of the site plus scam,

513
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
name of the site reviews to see if people had bad experiences.

514
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And it looked legit, so that's why I went for it.

515
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But yeah, there's something about the whole concept of buying overseas codes domestically

516
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
that are that cheap is weird, but I don't know.

517
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Keep monitoring your credit card statements. That's all I'm going to say.

518
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, that's why I use PayPal.

519
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, I wouldn't use my credit card.

520
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I hope it was just excess copies in Russia or something that got unloaded on this site.

521
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I really hope you don't get screwed. So we'll see.

522
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I would never advise somebody to do that. You're taking a huge, huge risk.

523
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I mean, I know you obviously very well.

524
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You weighed the pros and the cons and went for it.

525
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But do you think you would buy another game this way?

526
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Or do you think maybe it's worth the extra $10 or whatever next time

527
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
to just have the peace of mind it's a legit place?

528
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I would buy it through a legit, or more legit,

529
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
like an actual game client like Steam or Origin or Amazon.

530
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:17,000
But because I'm so broke right now, I didn't want to download a...

531
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I think that's important to say, too, is that you are in a financial bind right now, right?

532
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Like, I don't want to make you...

533
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Boy, I'm making this up.

534
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But you're at a financial not-so-great point right now.

535
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So the fact that you could save that money and still get the game you wanted was really important.

536
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I absolutely wanted to pay money for the game.

537
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I was just like, how cheap can I do this?

538
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And I found a way that worked.

539
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, and there's actually, on Amazon right now,

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
there's a seller selling a boxed copy and everything for $28.

541
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And you pay $4 shipping.

542
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Although I could pay $39 on Amazon right now and buy the boxed copy and get free shipping.

543
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So if I don't see it cheaper, it fries, pretty much.

544
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
All right.

545
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Well, thank you for sharing your story.

546
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Let's move on and talk about Loki's Gaming Week,

547
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
which, as I understand from what we heard at the end of Bobby Blackwell's show,

548
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
was a little bit controversial, right, Loki?

549
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Well, yeah, some of it.

550
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
So I play lots of Minecraft, which is part of the course.

551
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Finished my demon head entrance to my volcanic lair type thing.

552
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And it looks pretty awesome.

553
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Although one gripe I have about the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft is,

554
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
you know how you take screenshots and stuff and you can set your gamma settings

555
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
so that you can actually see it on your TV?

556
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It doesn't adjust for those settings when you take a screenshot.

557
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So it was completely bright on my screen, but completely dark in the picture I took.

558
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's kind of annoying.

559
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
They should make it so that it shows what you have on your screen.

560
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Then I played more Modern Warfare 3, and that was fun.

561
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Still kicking ass.

562
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Hopefully they're supposed to be releasing a new free map soon for Terminal,

563
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
which I believe is a remade Modern Warfare 2 map.

564
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So I played a bit of that.

565
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And then you may remember I talked a little bit about this whole Ready Player One contest thing

566
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
and how they have three gates or whatever that you're going to go through

567
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and have video game challenges.

568
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And all of them were supposed to be retro challenges kind of tied into the whole book

569
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
because it was all about old retro 80s games and stuff.

570
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:40,000
One of the challenges they had was playing Joust against this computer player and Zork.

571
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
God, I can't remember the third challenge.

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I think it was playing music or something.

573
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Anyways, so stuff like that.

574
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So the first gate that they had was a 2600 game.

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It was a brand new 2600 game that they made specifically for this whole contest, which is awesome.

576
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It has really cool, and it kind of keeps with the whole theme of the book.

577
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The second gate, however, not quite along those lines.

578
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Instead, it is go play this game that's created by Richard Garrett,

579
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
the guy behind Ultima Online.

580
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He's traveled the space and all that fun shit.

581
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And it's a game called Ultimate Collector Garage Sale.

582
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
It's a Facebook game in beta right now.

583
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So it is fucking broken.

584
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Just so laggy and broken and just terrible.

585
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And here's the best part about the game.

586
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's, of course, one of those free games that you would see on Facebook

587
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
that nickel and dime you for every goddamn thing that you want to do in it.

588
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And that's no different with this one.

589
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And it looks kind of like The Sims.

590
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
But there's already people that have completed this challenge.

591
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And I can tell you right now, having played this game for about four hours,

592
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
there is no way you can do that in that time frame without paying money

593
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to get extra dollars or whatever to be able to cycle things faster,

594
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
give yourself more energy, and that kind of thing.

595
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So basically, they bought their way through this game.

596
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And it's definitely proven in the screenshot of the first person that did finish it.

597
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He had two credit cards sitting there right next to his computer monitor.

598
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So it's just kind of a really bad vibe.

599
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I mean, they went from this really cool retro game challenge thing to,

600
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
hey, play this Facebook game.

601
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You know there's fucking money switching hands there.

602
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And yeah, it's kind of cool that they hid some stuff in here.

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But I've played this game for, like I said, about four hours.

604
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I've only come up with maybe two of the items I'm supposed to be finding for this thing.

605
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
And there's about, I think, 50 some items that you need to find.

606
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And it's all random.

607
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So there's no...

608
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'll be lucky to finish it within a month's time, let alone knocking it out in a day,

609
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
which I was hoping to be able to knock everything out in a day or so

610
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
because, you know, get a jump on it like I didn't quite do with the first gate.

611
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But it's really disappointing that this is what it's come down to,

612
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
is that they have this crappy Facebook game.

613
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And I hate playing Facebook games.

614
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Or at least this type of game where it's like,

615
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
oh yeah, you know, you want to rummage through that box.

616
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Well, it's going to cost you one energy.

617
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Oh, you don't have energy right now?

618
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You can pay some money to get some energy.

619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Or hey, you don't have enough money to buy that upgrade.

620
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The type of competition you guys are playing, that was a terrible idea.

621
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It really was.

622
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
There's no skill in this.

623
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The skill in this is having the patience to fucking wait this long.

624
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
They got to pay for that DeLorean somehow.

625
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
He can pay for it with his book sales money.

626
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I mean, he didn't have to do this.

627
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Maybe the next contest will be getting to play Tabula Rasa,

628
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
the other great Lord British game.

629
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
No, I shouldn't kick him when he's down.

630
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Obviously the Ultima series was phenomenal, so important to gaming's history.

631
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And I don't blame him at all.

632
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So what, he wants to create a Facebook game?

633
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That's fine.

634
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I have no problem with him creating a Facebook game.

635
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I have a problem with him using this Facebook game in the state that it is.

636
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's not finished.

637
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Using it to further this contest.

638
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
And yeah, it's cool that they hit all these different items in this game.

639
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But it's not done.

640
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's buggy.

641
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,000
When I first started playing it, I ran into a glitch where I was selling stuff in my garage sale,

642
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and the items disappeared.

643
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And then those racks that I was using, I couldn't put anything on them.

644
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And you're limited to a certain amount of racks that you have in your garage sale area, I guess.

645
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And so it was stuck for a few days, and I couldn't do anything.

646
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And then they finally fixed it, and then they had people having trouble logging into the server

647
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
because the server was down because too many people were hammering it.

648
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:14,000
And then there was an issue where the link from the actual contest to the Facebook game was broken.

649
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's just bad.

650
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I don't like, you know, I just don't like the way it's being handled right now.

651
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But I'm still going to play it because I have to in order to get to the next gate,

652
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
or at least be able to be in the running still, so it's just sad that I have to do this the hard way,

653
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
whereas I see these guys, yeah, I beat it in four hours!

654
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But it won't matter at the end of the day, right?

655
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
You just have to clear it in 30 days, right?

656
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I just have to clear it within 30 days, but I just hope the last gate isn't anything like this bullshit.

657
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, that would be a real stinker on the competition.

658
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So that's that.

659
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

660
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Um... I think that's it.

661
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Alright, so my gaming week. A lot of the same old stuff.

662
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I've been playing Mass Effect 3, a little bit of World of Warcraft.

663
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I can't think of anything new that I tried this week.

664
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I went back to a game from a couple years ago, just because.

665
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I just had an itch to play it, and that's New Super Mario Brothers Wii.

666
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I don't know, I just never finished it years ago.

667
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I got really close and never finished it years and years ago.

668
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So I just went back and played it a little bit, and I was like,

669
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Oh, it's actually a pretty good Mario game.

670
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I forgot how much of the Mario universe, not to be confused with the game,

671
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
they kind of brought into this game.

672
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
So, you know, the fact that there's Yoshi and Fire Flowers and Ice Flowers.

673
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But anyway, it's an old game.

674
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Either you've played it by now or you haven't, or you're waiting for the next one on Wii U.

675
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like, I'm sure Loki is with great anticipation.

676
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
So, I promised a little while ago we could talk about a game that I've been playing

677
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
that I didn't tell a lot of people that I was going to go play.

678
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Because it just kind of happened.

679
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I've been having the codes sitting in my Steam account for probably about a year now.

680
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Because Alan trolled me when he used to hear me talk about this game an awful lot.

681
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And he said, Oh look, it's on sale on Steam right now for just like $9.99.

682
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm going to buy these codes for you, just to kind of troll you a little bit.

683
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It was, you know, when we were, the finances were better and all that stuff and we could, you know,

684
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
throw $10 at each other to troll each other with stuff.

685
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
But I never used it. I'm like, I'm too busy playing these other games.

686
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm not going to go back and play this game.

687
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I don't have the time to sink into this crap because this game is such a time sink.

688
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I don't have time for it.

689
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But then last week, Shane and I were getting around to talking about the expansion pack for Final Fantasy XI.

690
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
And I realized, Oh, I have those codes I never did use that Alan got me on Steam.

691
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What the hell? I'm going to just roll a brand new character.

692
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm going to go back into the game and see what's changed.

693
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So I've played a little bit of Final Fantasy XI this week.

694
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And I got to tell you, yes, a lot has changed.

695
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
The game is drastically different.

696
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let me put this into perspective.

697
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Loki, I know you played Final Fantasy XI for a long time, so I know you'll be able to speak this language.

698
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
You ready?

699
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Do you know what I accomplished in three days of light gameplay on Final Fantasy XI?

700
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
No. What did you accomplish?

701
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I am level 25 white mage with a black mage sub job already leveled.

702
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And I did the sub job quest.

703
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That's pretty awesome.

704
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It might have been over three days, but you and Nikhletov have been playing a lot in the last three days.

705
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So don't say casually in an hour you gained five levels.

706
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It hasn't been, well, yes. Once we figured out what we were doing, yes, it has been that fast.

707
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I guess the thing is now, one of the things that was implemented in the game that changed things drastically

708
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
is they put in these things called field manuals, which are these books that sit out in the open.

709
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And you do what's called page burning.

710
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You take a page and it'll say, kill six worms.

711
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,000
So you go out, you kill six worms, and you get bonus XP and you get bonus gil once every real world hour.

712
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm sorry, you get the bonus XP every time.

713
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You get bonus gil and this other thing called tabs once every real world hour,

714
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
so that way you can't just be getting it and getting it.

715
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:21,000
So what people do now is one of the zones, Gusk and Mines, one of the book burns is kill six skeletons.

716
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So people go into parties there at level 10 and book burn over and over and over,

717
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
just pull skeletons over and over in alliances of 18 people just pulling these skeletons over and over

718
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and level, level, level, level, level, level.

719
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You're just gaining levels that fast.

720
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And apparently you do it in Gusk and Mines, you do it in Crawler's Nest,

721
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
you do it in one of the dungeons and you're all the way to 75 in a couple days.

722
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That's what, like, the leveling game is gone in Final Fantasy XI.

723
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
It's just you sit there and collect XP.

724
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,000
People go AFK and just sit there and collect the XP because the skeletons are that easy to kill,

725
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
yet you still get the XP.

726
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Here's the thing that concerns me.

727
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I see the look on Loki's face and he's going, oh, really?

728
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
No, I'm just, it kind of ruins, what's the point then?

729
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I mean, why bother getting, you know, good armor and stuff like that?

730
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You don't. It's all, because now it's all about the end game.

731
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
They went Guild Wars in their design.

732
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They made it so that, oh, getting to max level is easy.

733
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
It's all about the end game now and getting you to end game is not a problem.

734
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Because the end game is still hard and you've got crafting and all that stuff, right?

735
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Crafting's still a bitch. As I'm finding out, making money's still a pain in the ass and all this stuff.

736
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But the leveling game, now it takes no time at all to be max level.

737
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You do still have to do, from what I understand, the limit break quest.

738
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Oh, I hate those.

739
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But now that the level cap is 99, then people are getting there no problem.

740
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Just get a couple 99s to run you through all the limit break quests, you're done.

741
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I still hate that, though.

742
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, I know. It is kind of annoying.

743
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So, a sitting vampire in chat says, yeah, but there is a cooldown for those book quests, right?

744
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No. There isn't.

745
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You get the XP every time.

746
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Six skeletons, XP.

747
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Six more, XP.

748
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Six more, XP.

749
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You get the gil and the tabs once an hour.

750
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That just makes me think of that Eddie Izzard sketch.

751
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Uh-huh.

752
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You have crossed a bridge, champagne!

753
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You have entered a shop, champagne!

754
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You've left a shop, champagne!

755
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You have fallen into a ditch, junk, champagne!

756
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
There actually is a zone called Sarah McGue Champagne.

757
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I just made a Final Fantasy XI joke.

758
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm done with that game.

759
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Anyhow.

760
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Alright, so anyway, that's...

761
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh my god, something just popped into my head.

762
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
What?

763
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
A Mass Effect MMO.

764
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Wouldn't it be awesome?

765
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
It would, but...

766
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Bioware, do it!

767
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Bioware did the Star Trek MMO and it's having issues, so they've got to clear those up first.

768
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Could I play an Elcor monk?

769
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That would be great.

770
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Anywhere. Anyway.

771
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That's really it.

772
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I'm going to try to do some more writing for VoG and kind of write my thoughts a little bit more and put some screenshots up there.

773
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So, you know, you guys have an idea of what's going on.

774
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But, um, I was...

775
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
You know, and I've had a couple people in chat saying,

776
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You should go back and try it. You should go back and try it. A lot's changed.

777
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Alright, so I finally went back.

778
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I was slow in doing it. It's like Jamie playing Mass Effect finally.

779
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Took me a little while, but now that I'm doing it, yeah, I'm enjoying it.

780
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Am I going to leave WoW for it?

781
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
No.

782
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The only reason this is catching on right now is because there's not a lot to do in WoW right now.

783
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
But once the panda people hit,

784
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'll probably be saying bye-bye to Final Fantasy XI.

785
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
A lot of it is really about the people.

786
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And I just don't know people in Final Fantasy XI.

787
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Druid guild.

788
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
We need a druid guild knight.

789
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Alright, let me know when.

790
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Anyhow.

791
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I would not play a turian.

792
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But I would romance a turian.

793
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Answering Tigerclaw.

794
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I would play a Drell.

795
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Ragenator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

796
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Although I haven't played it in years, I used to love Final Fantasy XI.

797
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It has changed a lot.

798
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And I guess in some ways for the better, in some ways not for the better.

799
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
So.

800
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Anyhow.

801
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That was my experiences with Final Fantasy XI and my gaming week.

802
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Alright.

803
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Let's move on.

804
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Housekeeping tonight.

805
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I want to talk a little bit about something new on VoG Network.

806
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
First off, thank you to everybody.

807
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
The full website has been launched for 30 days now.

808
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And I can't believe it's only been a month.

809
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Because it feels like it's kind of been a lot longer than that.

810
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But maybe I'm thinking about the temporary site we had and all that.

811
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But the first month of VoG Network has been very successful.

812
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Bobby wrote a whole little summary with number crunching like mad over at VoG Network.com.

813
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You can kind of look at that story and see exactly how many posts were commented on.

814
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And how many people clicked the like button and all that good stuff.

815
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Well, one feature that has been demanded time and time again is now becoming a reality starting today.

816
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The porn channel.

817
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
No, not the porn channel.

818
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Maybe in August.

819
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But for now, the podcast check-in feature is now going to be live.

820
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Now, I want to make this clear.

821
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
For now, it's being tested.

822
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
We're calling July a test phase.

823
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So, it's only available on certain VoG shows.

824
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's only available on Bobby Black Wolf, our show.

825
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And it will be available next week on Understation Live.

826
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
That's it for right now.

827
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But in the future, hopefully it will work.

828
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And we'll be able to roll it out to more shows in the future.

829
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,000
How the podcast check-ins work is that at some point throughout the show,

830
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and it's never going to be in the same place because we know how people like to work the system,

831
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
at some point during the show, you will hear a little prerecorded message.

832
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And you know what?

833
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
For the podcast listeners, I'm going to make tonight's very, very easy.

834
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
To register participation with this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on VoGnetwork.com,

835
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
use the pass phrase, zone.

836
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Now, for the live listeners, you didn't get to hear anything right there because this is for the podcast.

837
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
This is something they're going to have because you get to check into the shows when they're live.

838
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But for the podcast, for whatever that word was that you just heard,

839
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
you're going to go to VoGnetwork.com and you're going to put that word right there underneath the leaderboard.

840
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And you'll be able to check into the show, get the same amount of points that the live listeners get for listening live.

841
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Because the point is, live podcast, you're participating.

842
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We still love you either way.

843
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So we want you to get the points either way.

844
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Now, if you listen live and you check in on the podcast, you're not going to get the points twice.

845
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Sorry, we just thought that would be too much of an unfair advantage to the individuals that have the time for both.

846
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But you might want to still consider doing it anyway if you do happen to listen to both,

847
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
or you listen to part of one and go back and listen to the podcast later.

848
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I would encourage you to do it because it's still being tracked in case one day there is show specific loot.

849
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,000
For example, we might give you some loot if you check into the podcast and the live show three weeks in a row or something like that.

850
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I don't know. Hypothetical, we haven't designed any of that yet.

851
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So there you go. That is now a feature that is available to you guys at VoGnetwork.com, podcast check-ins.

852
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm trying to make sure if I'm forgetting anything. I don't think so.

853
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I think, again, it could be at any point throughout the show.

854
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm not going to explain it every week. If you want more of an explanation, one is available at VoGnetwork.com.

855
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Right next to the little box where you put in the password to check in is a little thing that says, what's this?

856
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And Bobby Blackwolf wrote a great little summary on the website at VoGnetwork.com.

857
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And if you're listening live and you have no idea what the hell this is all about, you're missing your chance, buddy, to collect some points and maybe some loot.

858
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Go to VoGnetwork.com, register for the site, and whenever we're live, as we are right now, you're going to see a link that says right there on the front page on the left side,

859
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
participate now and get points. And you go and you get points for checking into the show. Super easy.

860
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Okay. I think that's that. Let's move on with some gaming news.

861
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I need to throw this out there, though. Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R, Facebook, Orange Lounge Radio, Google Plus, search for Orange Lounge Radio.

862
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
There you go. Let's get into some actual gaming news. Loki.

863
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So, let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And the Wii U, Nintendo has already come out and said, hey, you know what?

864
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The Wii U, it's not going to be this really expensive system. It's going to have a reasonable price.

865
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And basically, Satoru Iwata, he said that the initial price point of the 3DS was considered relatively high by consumers and that they won't make the same mistake with the Wii U.

866
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So, I don't know. What do you think? I was privy to a little something.

867
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Is this Secret Club? Do we need to say don't tell other people this, that you heard it here?

868
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't know. I think I've covered my...

869
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Alright, let's go ahead and just make sure, if you're going to tell other people this big piece of information Loki's about to share, you didn't hear it here.

870
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, some of this is, what, what do you mean? So, when I, the Wii U, I think is a reasonable price. It's got a few reasonable prices, actually.

871
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:21,000
There's three different SKUs they're going to be launching with. What's in those SKUs? No idea. What I think they are, I'll get into that in a second.

872
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
So, the cheapest you're going to find a Wii U will be $249.99. So, there's that.

873
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The next price up, $299.99 and then $349.99 are the three different price points.

874
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Here's my thoughts on what they are because this is completely speculative. I don't know for a fact this is what it is.

875
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
$249.99 is going to get you a Wii U system with the gamepad controller and that's it.

876
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So, system, gamepad, it's basically you own a Wii right now. You have all the Wii remotes and nunchucks.

877
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Go on the online shop and enjoy.

878
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah, nunchucks. Done. There you go. You've got a system. You're ready to go with all the additional things that come with the Wii U.

879
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:13,000
$299.99 buys you a system that's going to have the Wii U gamepad and then an additional Wii remote plus and a nunchuck.

880
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Kind of like the Wii had.

881
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I bet it's going to be that other controller, the Xbox controller. They'll throw that in.

882
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
You give yours and then I'll give mine. Never mind. I'll shut up.

883
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And then $349.99 is going to be the Wii U system, the gamepad controller, the Wii remote plus, the nunchuck, and another pack-in game.

884
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Because I think they're going to do a pack-in with Nintendo Land. It just seems like such a pack-in type game that I think they're going to do that.

885
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Alright, here's my guess. I could be completely wrong. I'm going to throw it out there.

886
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:57,000
$249.99, bare bones system. $299, that's the one that's going to come, bare bones system, Classic Controller Pro, or whatever that thing is called, and Nintendo Land.

887
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I say you get the pack-in game at $299.

888
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:08,000
$349 will be, it will still have Nintendo Land, but it will not have the Classic Controller Pro.

889
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Instead, it's going to have two Wii U tablets for all the games that don't use them.

890
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
$700 bucks, blow up Miyamoto doll.

891
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Honestly, I do not think they're launching a system with two gamepads, because there's no games that support it, and people will be like, it won't sell.

892
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That may come later on when they have games that support two gamepads, but right now, it's absolutely useless to do that, which is why they're not going to do that.

893
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Apparently, from what I've read, Nintendo is rumored to be announcing the price points and release date in September, but there are the price points, release date is probably going to be the 18th of November, so hey, you figured it out two months before they're going to actually announce it.

894
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So that's that. I think it's somewhat reasonable.

895
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Yeah, actually $249 is kind of lower than what I thought, but...

896
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I'm not going to get one still, but it's...

897
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Has Nintendo launched with multiple SKUs like that since the original NES, which also came in three SKUs, funny enough?

898
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Um, I don't think so.

899
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So, no.

900
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And that's all I know of right now, is that they've got three price points, because that's what they want projections on, unless they're shopping price points and saying, okay, how many of this one are we going to sell?

901
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I don't think that they're like, we don't know what the charge for this.

902
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
$349 is way too much, I think, for the system to be out right now.

903
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:44,000
The thing that's going to be interesting, though, is that gives Microsoft and Sony enough time to where I think they could drop their console price again by the time that comes out, and $249 would not be that much of a stretch.

904
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:55,000
That's another $50 price point, or $50... I think it's another $50 drop, or are they $199,299? I can't remember right now. They may be $199,299.

905
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Or, it could be onboard storage, like, you know, this system has more storage than this system.

906
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Although, I mean, I wouldn't pay $50 more for onboard storage.

907
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
The Apple approach?

908
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I don't know if they're going to do that, but...

909
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Interesting. I don't know. We'll find out soon enough what they're going to be throwing in there, and when it will be available, but we have a pretty good hunch of what might be in there and when it might be available.

910
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Did you talk about the online part yet?

911
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Nope. Online is going to be free, and thank God, too, because like we've seen so far, we have no fucking clue what they're doing online.

912
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So, yeah. Free sounds good. I mean, because honestly, I haven't seen anything offered on it that was anything more than what's on the Wii, aside from, hey, now you can put forum posts on games and stuff.

913
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
You know, which... hooray? I don't know.

914
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Do you think they might go the route that PlayStation Plus went, where, yeah, it's free, but maybe if you do give us money, we'll give you little freebies?

915
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Because certainly there's enough of a back catalog of virtual console crap that they could give that shit out like candy.

916
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Um, they could do that, but I don't think that they're organized well enough to do that right now. That may be something that comes way later on. I just think they're too late to...

917
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Something is not in the show world tonight. I know they made a major hire this week with somebody from Disney Studios is, like, in charge of their online now.

918
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Disney had that unique thing that they did a while back where it was DGamer or something like that. Um, it was kind of like their, like, online hub thing. They had, you know, avatars and stuff like that.

919
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And it was tied in with, like, their DS Disney games, which probably no one remembers any of that stuff. But, um, that was kind of cool, and the offerings that they had in there were pretty cool.

920
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
But I got... I hope they don't go that route because it was really stupid.

921
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Doesn't Disney also have some fairly popular online games, like Club Penguin, I know is a pretty big deal.

922
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And then, like, Pirates of the Caribbean. Like, I know their games are really big on having the phrases already there, and you can only pick from those phrases to communicate with.

923
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Like, you can't type in your own stuff. They used to keep it safe.

924
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I... cool. I just, you know... I... once again, it's... I don't want to have this so, like, chopped off of the balls, I guess. You know, where it's...

925
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Why would I want to, you know, buy a brand... first off, why am I going to buy a brand new system that basically is, you know, as graphically powerful as my current Xbox 360?

926
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Yeah, it may edge it out a little bit, but I don't think they're going to be really utilizing that. I don't think you're going to see games on a Wii U right now.

927
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
They're going to be like, wow, that looks so much better than the Xbox 360 version. You're not going to see that.

928
00:51:47,000 --> 00:52:07,000
ActDeft brings up another good point in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. It says, Where's My Water is pretty awesome. And that's right, that reminded me, I forgot, Disney does have a pretty big footprint in the iHouse app universe right now as well. You know, with that Nintendo thing being a tablet where you're going to be able to play games on it, that seems like an interesting little connection as well.

929
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Because obviously, Disney has the Where's My Water. They have a couple other games too. I know they own the Tap Tap brand now too. That's all Disney. So...

930
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I just, I don't know. I don't have very high expectations for them. They're also supposed to be in September, they're supposed to be talking about 2013 titles for the Wii U.

931
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Really?

932
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Which honestly, I think that's... it's too... it's too early to be talking stuff for next year.

933
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Is this the parallel Tokyo Game Show conference they own?

934
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It's another one of their five billion press conferences that I don't fucking care about because, like seriously, just get all your shit out at one time, not this.

935
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Well, today we're going to talk about the first three digits of the price and then maybe we'll have another press conference to talk about the last few digits.

936
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:58,000
And then we're going to give you the day of the week that the system's coming out, this press conference.

937
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And then the next week we'll talk about which month it's coming out, and then maybe the hour or another... I mean, seriously, they waste so much fucking time with this stuff.

938
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I mean, that's fine. People keep talking about it. They're like, hey, people keep covering our press conferences.

939
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That's how you do it.

940
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Yeah, but people keep covering it because they're like, wow, you didn't really announce anything. That's fantastic that you didn't announce anything. Very important.

941
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Well, you know, when there's not a lot of gaming news, you know, that's a great time to have a press conference or it's a great time to report on people's Twitter activity.

942
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And that's what I want to talk about here is game director Katsuhiro Harada. He is the director of Tekken.

943
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And he posted a very interesting rant this week on Twitter. Now, I always thought Twitter was restricted to 140 characters, but he wrote a whole little essay on there thanks to...

944
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Twitlonger.

945
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Twitlonger.

946
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Or Tweetlonger.

947
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Which apparently is a thing. Twitlonger.com. And he put this whole little rant about people who constantly tell him, switch back to the voice actors used previously.

948
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And I guess he's pretty pissed off about it. He said in this... I'm going to quote some parts of this rant here on Twitlonger.

949
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Quote, the voice you were listening to was 16 years ago during the PlayStation period. The current generation of consoles are totally different in how they play back sound, both software wise and internal circuitry.

950
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Quote, also you're assuming the voice actors themselves can reproduce the voice they recorded 16 years ago. Many voice actors decline work because their voice has changed since the original role.

951
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Some have even retired. Sometimes they won't accept, even if we ask.

952
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Quote, some might just say, just pay them to reuse the voice data, but often the voice actors decline this, or their agency declines.

953
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Quote, Brian's laugh is the actual data from Tekken 3. As fans have requested, we've kept using the original, adapting the data recorded 16 years ago to be used on the PlayStation 2 and then PlayStation 3.

954
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Even so, some people said it is a different voice in Tekken 6 than the original. It can't be helped, they might think that.

955
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And he goes on to talk about the whole conversion process and so forth.

956
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But I love this. He says at the very end of this, he says, quote, after this lengthy explanation, I will be quite surprised if there are still people who still don't get it.

957
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Thanks for understanding or not understanding. Whatever.

958
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Bro, you mad? You real mad.

959
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I guess this is starting to get to him. But I can see, I can see where he's annoyed. I can see where the fandom is like, don't change it. It's perfect. Don't change it.

960
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I like Tekken 6 sucks. I want Tekken 1. I want the voice from Tekken 1. But he does make a good point. You have to license those voices every time. And sometimes they say no.

961
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Voice actors can step out on a green light to cross the street and get hit by a bus. What are you going to do? People die. I mean, what do they want? You have to find a replacement sometimes.

962
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And honestly, if you like the voice acting better in Tekken 2, go play Tekken 2.

963
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That's a good point. But I think the problem is too many people are playing Tekken 2 and not enough are playing Tekken 6.

964
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Tekken 3 was the best.

965
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Oh wait, here's another great quote. I have even complied to the request of you all spamming me to bring back characters from previous installments.

966
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:32,000
You often say, let's show the dev team how sincere we are by buying two copies if they bring back character X.

967
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
But did you really go through with it, expecting you to at least pre-order the game? I was met with more spam.

968
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
After you apparently didn't notice that June and Michelle actually returned.

969
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I still have some characters left to be revealed that will comply with some of your requests, even bringing back several others.

970
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Even so, none of them are paid DLC. I will continue to sincerely comply with fan requests.

971
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:07,000
However, I can't continue to engage the negative ones that, without knowing what you are talking about or even thinking about when you're saying blindly repeat, bring back, bring back, bring back.

972
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
He's like, shut up. Am I not doing enough? Are you people not happy?

973
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
As the magical sunglasses float from above and land on his face.

974
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Seriously, that is seriously like the Twitter equivalent of, deal with it. This guy rocks.

975
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I kind of wish more people would tell off their fan bases.

976
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
That rant kind of makes you want to give Tekken 6 another chance, because we did try playing it and it was kind of poopy. I didn't care for it.

977
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Five or six. Wasn't it six? I guess. I don't know. It was six. I've lost count. It was six.

978
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I mean, it had to be a game fly for a day, but yeah, it was probably six.

979
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Anyway. Alright, let's move on with some other news. DarkSakura, we need to stop reporting on Twitter activity.

980
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Okay, well, if it's any surprise, this is about Mass Effect 3. Which no one's surprised, especially Rob, because he gave me the story.

981
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Thank you.

982
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yeah, the Extended Cut DLC was out and everybody is happy. Well, okay, not everyone's happy. There's still some people who are like, meh.

983
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Which I had to stop myself from watching it, even though I watched some of it.

984
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Okay, so going forward, they're actually talking about already doing more download content that they're working on right now.

985
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So, it was teased in a tweet that in regards to more download content, it said, that's a trick question, we'll save the future DLC for future chats.

986
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Don't worry though, there's much more.

987
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Mass Effect 2 had a DLC cycle that was a year and a half, because Arrival came out I think March or April of 2011.

988
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I think so.

989
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And it was a 2010 game, Mass Effect 2. So, yeah, they need to, you know, DLC for the multiplayer would be nice.

990
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And then what happens to Omega with Aria, and there's definitely campaigns they can add.

991
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Well, I really hope the Omega thing. I'd love to see more Aria. I really hope they got Carrie Ann Moss to do additional dialogue so they can do that. That would be great.

992
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Well, given that I've only done a little bit in Mass Effect 2 of going to Omega, yeah. So anyway, I kind of, I mean, I won't have much more of an opinion until I get into Mass Effect 3.

993
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
But there's little side characters that I kind of liked that I wouldn't mind.

994
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:39,000
I'm all about extending the game's life with DLC. In fact, I'm kind of sad that we haven't seen DLC really yet, except, of course, yes, I know the extended cut DLC.

995
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I didn't really get into that during my gaming week, I just realized. I guess I figured most people who wanted to see it, went and got it on Tuesday, and y'all have formed your other opinions already, I'm gonna make it brief.

996
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I've got to keep it spoiler free, because obviously Jamie hasn't got there yet and I don't want to ruin it for her. And neither should you, chat room.

997
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I will say this. BioWare said they're not changing the ending, they're gonna just give you further details on the ending they made. That's exactly what they did.

998
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Although I understand they changed one thing.

999
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
There is one, well...

1000
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
They added something.

1001
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:27,000
They added a big something, that some people say is a giant F you to the fan base, and I say, deal with it. I thought it was great. And they did change some other things that they got called out by continuity cops.

1002
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Yeah, so apparently, Maya, big thing of wondering, this is just what was cleared up for me, that my big thing of wondering, what are all of those Turians gonna eat?

1003
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Got fixed.

1004
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So I feel happy about that.

1005
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
They made some stuff very clear. Very clear.

1006
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Yeah, and as far as them adding details, it was a lot of details, did it? I think it left enough people satisfied that the people that are still, like, furious about it are being brats.

1007
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:05,000
But the content that we got on Tuesday should have been in it from day one. It's not that spectacular where we can go, look dipshits, it wasn't that hard. This is good, this should have been in the original product.

1008
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That's kind of the consensus overall that I'm getting from most people is that I'm happy with this. I wish it had been this way the first time. And if it had been, there probably wouldn't have been as much butthurt, and I'm okay with that.

1009
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
For me, it will be in it the first time.

1010
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
There you go. And, you know, I think a lot of fans-

1011
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Patience is a virtue.

1012
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:37,000
A lot of fans should realize there are a lot of people like Jamie, that still haven't played the entire series, and you know, Mass Effect will continue to kind of grow in the fans and so forth. I will say this because this isn't really a spoiler.

1013
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:46,000
One thing I noticed they did add at the very, very, very end after the credits and after everything is they put a little pop up message that says, you know, thank you for playing Mass Effect.

1014
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,000
We really appreciate all your feedback and your comment, you know, kind of the PC thing they have to say over the years, and we hope you've enjoyed Mass Effect 3.

1015
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:09,000
We can't wait to, you know, see you for whatever Mass Effect has in store next type of thing. So they do basically say this is not the last Mass Effect. They don't say Mass Effect 4, but they basically say there'll be more.

1016
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Like I said, the whole ending would be to be continued with DLC.

1017
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:26,000
No, I don't think it's that. I think that the DLC is going to go back and add more content, like exactly how they did with Mass Effect 2. All of it is stuff that happens before the end of the game.

1018
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And one of them is a really big, the Arrival thing is a really big, big thing from what I understand.

1019
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Well, Arrival is also truly a bridge between 2 and 3, and it was the very last 3 starts immediately referencing what happens to Shepard and Arrival.

1020
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:53,000
That's what I had heard. And so that's why I thought, OK, that's good. I mean, it's all stuff that ties right back in. So I'm pretty I'm pretty happy.

1021
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I mean, I get to play through Mass Effect 3 with the true ending. I mean, in my head.

1022
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You'll never experience that hurt.

1023
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Keep in mind that a lot of it got some of it got spoiled for me.

1024
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'm going to punch you so you can experience some of the hurt.

1025
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
That's OK, Rob. I'm not being punched.

1026
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Vandy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, referencing something you brought up earlier, Mass Effect MMO. Who knows?

1027
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I would quit WoW in a second for a Mass Effect MMO.

1028
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I don't think it's in the cards for BioWare after what's happened to Star Wars. I mean, if Star Wars can somehow be salvaged, maybe.

1029
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
But it should just be converted into Mass Effect MMO.

1030
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
No, no, it should not. They can do better, even better.

1031
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Well, I meant take the base engine and fudge with it some.

1032
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
All right. Let's move on. More gaming news. Loki.

1033
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
All right. So let's talk a little bit about the future. And this is kind of cool.

1034
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Mercury Steam, the team behind the Lords of Shadows game.

1035
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Yeah, it's part of Castlevania because, you know, they didn't think it could stand on its own.

1036
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:18,000
They're ready to basically call it, well, move on from the Castlevania franchise after the new 3DS game and Lords of Shadow 2.

1037
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:28,000
They said, we think it's, well, I think it's about wanting to leave a legacy and I don't want to be in charge of a series that perhaps over a certain time is going to decline.

1038
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I'd rather go out with a bang and leave our legacy in the Castlevania universe.

1039
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
And then, of course, you know, they also said they don't want to be known as Mr. Castlevania.

1040
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:47,000
And, you know, should Lords of Shadow 2 be very successful, they'd have another team do a sequel.

1041
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Of course, they were teasing that perhaps Contra is the next series that they will work on.

1042
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That'd be pretty cool. New Contra game.

1043
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I'd like to see Contra make a comeback.

1044
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Contra should make a comeback.

1045
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:06,000
But it's one of those games, like, it could easily be so fucked up. Like, they could really botch it bad.

1046
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
But, I mean, you know.

1047
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
What was it? Was it Contra?

1048
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Would they call it on the Xbox Live Arcade one, the anime?

1049
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Oh, Hardcore Uprising.

1050
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, Hardcore Uprising.

1051
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
That was pretty rad. I like that one.

1052
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So, even though that wasn't really Contra, but it was?

1053
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Hell yeah.

1054
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I mean, Hardcore Uprising is basically Contra.

1055
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I think it did have some of the music.

1056
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
So, anyway.

1057
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:40,000
If you like that anime-style look to Hardcore Uprising and some of those other online games, maybe you are an anime fan.

1058
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And maybe you'll be excited to hear that Viz Media is launching a subscription-based service called Neon Alley.

1059
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And it's going to be on consoles this fall.

1060
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
It's a 24-hour anime network.

1061
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Viz Media is the localization company that did stuff like Bleach, Naruto, and a lot of similar things.

1062
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Yeah, they've taken it way back. They did Ranma.

1063
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah, so they brought all that stateside.

1064
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
They've already said it's going to cost $6.99 a month.

1065
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It will not be an on-demand streaming app, which I find kind of strange because people are paying for it, but I guess they're taking the HBO approach.

1066
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:24,000
It will be an actual TV channel with schedules and all that stuff, uncensored content, HD, but it will always be dubbed in English.

1067
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I don't care anymore.

1068
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
This is the other thing.

1069
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:39,000
There will be advertisements, even though there is a subscription fee, the ads will be limited and they're there to keep the cost below $10.

1070
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Some of the programming coming to the channel, Naruto Shippuden, Inuyasha, The Final Act, Death Note, those are all coming to this network.

1071
01:06:50,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But they don't say exactly what consoles or how, but I guess we're left to assume it would be very easy for it to be a PlayStation 3 app akin to the Netflix or Hulu Plus or Vudu or any of that stuff.

1072
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And then we have on the Xbox 360, obviously those content channels are very easy to make and we've seen a lot of those, so it will be a Comcast-esque style channel.

1073
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Still very interesting because I can't think of any other on-demand channel that's run like an old-school TV network that's only available on a game console.

1074
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Very interesting. Interesting to see what could be in the future.

1075
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You know what, I'm still going to stick with fansubs.

1076
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Would you pay $6.99 a month for VOG TV?

1077
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Well, yeah, because we're far superior. And we'll play it in Japanese, I don't care.

1078
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I know you would think if it's all online it would be super easy to just have one channel in English and one in Japanese. That seems, you know, eh, that's weird.

1079
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Kind of like Laserdisc, play it in digital or analog.

1080
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Exactly, I think.

1081
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Alan, I know you're in anime, in fact you know way more about it than I do.

1082
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I used to be.

1083
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:14,000
He used to be. Okay, just the other day, I'm telling this on air, we were at a Sanrio store and there was a Sailor Moon backpack and you pointed at it.

1084
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah, because it reminds me of when I was 17 and not quite out yet, but clearly gay and Sailor Moon was awesome. It's pretty.

1085
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You know what, we should just marathon the entire thing from beginning to end.

1086
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I need to convert my awesome fansubs of the last three seasons I have on tape to something digital.

1087
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I've got rips of them. Yeah, Rob.

1088
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Would you pay $6.99 a month for this anime TV with commercials in English only?

1089
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Given that I haven't really watched anime with any type of seriousness in like 10 years, no, but from 98 to about 2003, fuck yeah.

1090
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:03,000
I just remembered what the last series I actually paid to have shipped to me from fansubs was on tape.

1091
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It was Mamata Shugogeten.

1092
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Was it worth it?

1093
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Well, I had watched a lot of it raw because a friend of mine taped some off the TV for me and then I watched most of it and then it came out in the US and I was like, well, crap.

1094
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I hardly ever watch anime. I think the last one I watched, seriously, was it was a vampire, was it Helsing?

1095
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Helsing, maybe.

1096
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I think it was the last one I watched.

1097
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And we watched that over at Jessica's Old Place after watching Shock Treatment.

1098
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Yeah, that sounds about right.

1099
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,000
With the projector that Evan had hooked up. I remember that. But like, I used to, I have boxes of laser discs.

1100
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
You know what we need to do? Have an anime convention, but like not restricted to anime.

1101
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
We need to just have a convention where it's like, everybody just fucking show up here and we're going to do awesome things.

1102
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
And if you don't like it, get the fuck out.

1103
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
You know what? I take that back. You know what the last series I actually downloaded everything was?

1104
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Supernatural.

1105
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
There's a Supernatural anime.

1106
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
And it's done by Studio Madhouse.

1107
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And I watched, no, it's like a whole season of stuff.

1108
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And the X-Men one, which was really good because I think that was also Madhouse.

1109
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
But anyway.

1110
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
GTFO Con. If you don't like it, GTFO.

1111
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
But be proud of me. Be either proud or sad for me.

1112
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I broke out my Gatchaman episodes from 1972 and was like singing along with it because I will always sing along with the Gatchaman theme.

1113
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:36,000
The last anime I guess I watched were all those Gatchaman commercials that Nintendo had after their last 3DS conference in Japan.

1114
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
What the hell was that?

1115
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I downloaded all the ones that that internet provider did in Japan that were live action with S.M.O.P.

1116
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
For anyone who doesn't know, S.M.O.P. is the Japanese version of Minuto.

1117
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, next news story.

1118
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And then release dates, a couple more news stories.

1119
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And then the classic game of the week, which is a real good one tonight.

1120
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Well there's a game that's been announced for PC, but it was originally a smartphone game.

1121
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
It's called Death Rally.

1122
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
It just has the best name ever.

1123
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
So it's being rebuilt for the PC with a new engine, camera, new controls.

1124
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Well of course it's going to be a new control since it was a phone game before.

1125
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And it's going to have a new track and the Shadow Man from the 1996 version.

1126
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So you should see it on Steam for 10 bucks.

1127
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
So if anyone wants Death Rally, it's on Steam.

1128
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And it actually looks pretty neat, you know, because it's cars and blowing up stuff.

1129
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And it was developed in Finland, where everybody is happy and has universal healthcare.

1130
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates coming to a country near you.

1131
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Possibly Finnish release dates, we might cover that in a minute.

1132
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
But first, the U.S.

1133
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Did you know that's true though?

1134
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,000
As far as international happiness level, Finland was rated number one.

1135
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
There is not much coming out this week.

1136
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
What did you just do to Dark Sakura to make her squee like that, Alan?

1137
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I brought out one of my awesome Sailor Moon, Sailor Stars fansub tapes.

1138
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Look at how awesome those are.

1139
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It's got a laser print sticker on the tape too, you should open it.

1140
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,000
To the radio listeners, it probably sounded like you grabbed her boob.

1141
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Alan, don't do that.

1142
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
This is awesome. Very cool.

1143
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
We had Fushigi Yugi like this for a while, back in the day.

1144
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Every episode of Fushigi Yugi.

1145
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Alright, so, sorry, we were with release dates.

1146
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Loki, not Jack and Shit.

1147
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Not much. It's literally Jack and Shit.

1148
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I don't know which one you're going to consider Jack or Shit, here we go.

1149
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
The Secret World, which is a new MMO being launched, that's coming out on PC.

1150
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
That looked interesting, that can be the Jack.

1151
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And then, Theater-Rhythm Final Fantasy for the 3DS.

1152
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
You know, it looks like shit, but everybody that's played it has really enjoyed it.

1153
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Somebody came on here and said that was their favorite game from PAX East.

1154
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So, maybe it's one of those looks can be deceiving things.

1155
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
That's out this week, huh? I might have to pick that up.

1156
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
There's no demo for that or anything?

1157
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There might be, I'm not sure. I mean, there's a Kingdom Hearts demo.

1158
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
There's a Kingdom Hearts demo because I finally recharged my DS so I could download that.

1159
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I would think that there would be a demo for that.

1160
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Rhythm Thief has a demo, but I don't think Theater-Rhythm does.

1161
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Hm, I don't know.

1162
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Chatters, what do you think? Which of those games sounds more exciting?

1163
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Secret World or Theater-Rhythm? I want to know. Live.vognetwork.com.

1164
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Meanwhile, Japanese release dates. Let's talk what's happening over there.

1165
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
July 5th, a little more exciting in Japan.

1166
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Xbox 360. Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon gets a price reduction.

1167
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Max Anarchy is the new game from Sega coming out on the 360.

1168
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And there's also Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier comes out in Japan as well.

1169
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Yeah, I really wish it was coming out over here. Max Anarchy or Anarchy Reigns over here.

1170
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I was going to say, it's Anarchy Reigns, right?

1171
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yeah, it got delayed next year.

1172
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Oh, wow. Really? So, you're going to have to import it, I guess, if you want to play it.

1173
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
No, I'm not.

1174
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Because it is also out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1175
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Which, as you know, PS3 is region-free, so if you really wanted to play it, you could.

1176
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Other games out on the PS3 this week. Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

1177
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Tactical Assault Commander 3 gets a price reduction.

1178
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Or it's, I guess, the camouflage version. Oh, no, that's $129. That's not a price reduction.

1179
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I don't know what that is. Oh, this is a... Never mind. You know what that is?

1180
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:38,000
American... It's one of those little MechWarrior mouse slash number pad slash draw...

1181
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
It's one of these things. Look. It's one of those. It's not a game.

1182
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
It's a peripheral that has the mouse. But it's for the PS3, which is interesting.

1183
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
So, it's definitely for more tactical-based strategy games.

1184
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Batman, Arkham Asylum, and Arkham City get price reductions in Japan this week,

1185
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
as they are released into the PS3, the best collection.

1186
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Looking at the handhelds here real quick, on the Vita, you have a game called

1187
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Dokuro comes out this week. I do not know...

1188
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I'm trying to think what this game is over here.

1189
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I thought I saw a preview for this, and I can't think of what this is called over here.

1190
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I've seen this somewhere. Yeah.

1191
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1192
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Let me see if these screenshots look familiar to you.

1193
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
It's on the Vita. This is Dokuro.

1194
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I thought I saw this in one of the PS3 conferences, and it looked interesting to me.

1195
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Looks interesting. Looks like a little bit of a side-scroller.

1196
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Kind of has a gothic-esque theme to it.

1197
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Looks a little bit like the Nightmare Before Christmas.

1198
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Lastly, on the 3DS this week, there are some more peripherals,

1199
01:15:51,000 --> 01:16:00,000
but as far as games go, we have Sekaiju no Meikyu 4 Denshu no Kaioshin

1200
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,000
comes out this week, and that is...

1201
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
a game where you make your own character and set up a team of explorers

1202
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
and go through labyrinths. Hey, Rob, it's an anime.

1203
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Is it? Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan.

1204
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Thank you. Dokuro means skull.

1205
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Maybe that's why it looks familiar. I've seen a cartoon version or something on YouTube.

1206
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Lastly, on the 3DS this week, Danball Senkai Baku Boost

1207
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
comes out this week from level 5. I believe it's...

1208
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I think it means skull.

1209
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
This is another one of those mech knights type of fighting games.

1210
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
There you go. Let's travel to the UK.

1211
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
On the 3rd, the Secret World. And on the 4th, Rainbow Moon,

1212
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
which makes me now think of Sailor Moon. Thank you, Alan.

1213
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,000
On the 6th, we have Beat the Beat Rhythm Paradise,

1214
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends, and Theater Rhythm Final Fantasy.

1215
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
That's it.

1216
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Some feedback on the release dates from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1217
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Stan says, I want to play Max Anarchy. Bayonetta's in it.

1218
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
S is the guy from Madworld.

1219
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
He's one of the main characters in it.

1220
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
In fact, I think a lot of the characters from Madworld are in there.

1221
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I want to say a lot of the villains are.

1222
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It looks interesting.

1223
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Why isn't Bayonetta 2 already a thing that came out in Japan last year?

1224
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
That's a great question. Why is that not a thing?

1225
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
It's because a developer probably wants to make it, but I don't think it was profitable.

1226
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I mean, it was somewhat profitable, but it's still a niche title,

1227
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
but I think that they totally would do that.

1228
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Because it's the guy who left Capcom Platinum Games.

1229
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
It's his studio that made it, and they're working on something else big now.

1230
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Metal Gear Rising.

1231
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
That would be a distraction.

1232
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Probably preventing a Bayonetta 2.

1233
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Unless Bayonetta is a secret character in Metal Gear Rising.

1234
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Let's fucking hope. For real.

1235
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You know, actually, the guy from Madworld would be a good character for that,

1236
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
because since it's all the cutting stuff, you could get him in there with his chainsaw arm.

1237
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Nice.

1238
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Alright, a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1239
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But first, Loki.

1240
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
So, you know, I really hate it when there's an awesome game coming out,

1241
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
and then it's all fucking buggy, Bethesda.

1242
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So, Ghost Recon Future Soldier on PC just came out this week,

1243
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
and apparently it is really buggy.

1244
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:40,000
A bunch of the PC users have kind of gathered on the Ubisoft forums

1245
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
and made a bug report for them.

1246
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Letting them know, you know, what exactly the issues are.

1247
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:57,000
And, you know, apparently it ranges from everything that, you know,

1248
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,000
the mouse doesn't work to some other minor things.

1249
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I don't know. It's just kind of bad, I guess.

1250
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I don't know. I'm not much of a PC player.

1251
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I would have thought, though, they took the extra time to get the PC version right.

1252
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I mean, because this game came out back in May,

1253
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
and the PC version not until, you know, the end of June.

1254
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And so now they just kind of, eh.

1255
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I don't know.

1256
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Test your shit. I mean, seriously.

1257
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
They literally have broken it down.

1258
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
They've broken it down.

1259
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
The hardware compatibility, input FPS resolution, graphic issues in game,

1260
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
online, audio menus, and other.

1261
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Why is it that these companies treat gamers like they're beta testers

1262
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and not like they're fucking, you know, customers?

1263
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I mean, that's stupid.

1264
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Oh, shit.

1265
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
We pre-order anyway.

1266
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
We didn't know those tires fell off of the car.

1267
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I mean, if we had driven it, we would have surely noticed that that was the case.

1268
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Your steering wheel only turns to the left?

1269
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Well, that's unfortunate.

1270
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
You know, thankfully our track, you know, we turned to the left.

1271
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And so, yeah.

1272
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Huh.

1273
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Well, now we talked a little bit before about anime.

1274
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
And I might not be the biggest anime fan in the world.

1275
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I mean, it's all right.

1276
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But one thing I do love is I love the stuff that comes from Miyazaki and all that stuff.

1277
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
So you know I'm looking forward to Ni no Kuni, which is the,

1278
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
or I guess that's already out in Japan, actually.

1279
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
But the English translation is coming out finally soon.

1280
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And in Europe, there is going to be a Wizards edition that comes out.

1281
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And it's going to have a copy of what's called the Wizards Companion,

1282
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
which is the spell book used in game.

1283
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
There's a Drippy doll.

1284
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It doesn't actually drip.

1285
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Drippy is the little character that comes with it.

1286
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
You get some other DLC stuff with this.

1287
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And that will be out when the game comes out on January 25th.

1288
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And some good news.

1289
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It was announced for North America shortly afterwards.

1290
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:14,000
However, you can only get it on Namco's online shop at store.namcobandigames.com.

1291
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
It will set you back $99.99.

1292
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But I got to say, looks pretty awesome.

1293
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I'm really looking forward to this game.

1294
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So that's one I'll be playing early next year for sure.

1295
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Ni no Kuni.

1296
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I think I'm sort of past that phase where I'm buying special editions of just about everything.

1297
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Yeah, me too.

1298
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And I hate the DLC stuff.

1299
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I think my burn phase was when I bought the Cardcaptor Sakura game on Dreamcast.

1300
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Paid 90 bucks for a plate and a clock and a fork and a spoon.

1301
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
And a pillowcase.

1302
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I mean if the collector's edition is $10 more or $20 maybe tops and it's a series I really love, then maybe.

1303
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But you are asking me to take a big risk here on Ni no Kuni.

1304
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Sometimes those collector's editions kind of bomb too.

1305
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Like the Tron video game.

1306
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I see those collector's editions still on clearance.

1307
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
It's been almost a year and a half since the movie and the game.

1308
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So people are still trying to unload those collector's editions.

1309
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Even popular ones like Halo Reach and stuff.

1310
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
That's true.

1311
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
A ton of those.

1312
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Yeah.

1313
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Alright.

1314
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Well, let's go back to a time when things were simpler.

1315
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:26,000
We didn't have $400 collector's editions of games or games that come with leather jackets which I think was a thing a couple weeks ago.

1316
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
A time when games were classic.

1317
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
You bought the $50 game and if you didn't like it the way it was out of the box then F you.

1318
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Or when you would go around from store to store so that you could get the Killer Instinct CD.

1319
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And sometimes these games that you would buy would be hard as hell too.

1320
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And I think that's a very important thing to state.

1321
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And God, I hope you were good.

1322
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Anyway, it's the classic game of the week.

1323
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1324
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Ninja Gaiden for the NES.

1325
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Specifically, the NES version.

1326
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
It's hard as fuck.

1327
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,000
In Japan it was called Ninja Ryukenden which is Legend of the Ninja Dragon Sword.

1328
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And in Europe it was Shadow Warriors because there was this big taboo about using the word ninja.

1329
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,000
For example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles over there.

1330
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
There you go. I know my stuff.

1331
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:22,000
So it was a little platformer where you beat people up and chopped them in half with your sword.

1332
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And it was ported to the PC Engine.

1333
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Actually, let me start back.

1334
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It came out in December 1988 in Japan, March 1989 in North America, and September 1991 in Europe.

1335
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:45,000
There was a PC Engine version in 1992 and a Super NES version as part of the Ninja Gaiden trilogy in 1995.

1336
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And there's been mobile phone versions with episodic content.

1337
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And it's now on the Virtual Console as of 2007.

1338
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So you play as Ryu Hayabusa, who we might also know from Dead or Alive and the current Ninja Gaiden games.

1339
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So he's learned that someone named the Jockio plans to take control of the world by using demon power.

1340
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
So you have to go through all the different acts and you have 20 levels.

1341
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:22,000
And it's hard. Hard, hard, hard, hard.

1342
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:34,000
More than that, the big thing is that it had such an elaborate story and used cinematic cut scenes as far as an 8-bit system could handle.

1343
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Which were epic as fuck at the time. Seriously.

1344
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And it even had a novelization done in...

1345
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Oh, it was one of the FX9 books, wasn't it?

1346
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yeah, the Worlds of Power-ness.

1347
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Oh, that's right!

1348
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
And he actually kind of had something to write off of.

1349
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
He had to just make shit up for games like Simon's Quest, where the story for Simon's Quest was really strange.

1350
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
But yeah, he actually was able to keep the Ninja Gaiden one pretty close to the cinematics.

1351
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Yeah.

1352
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
So basically, it's just super hard.

1353
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
This is a game I haven't eaten.

1354
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You can use Shuriken, you can use your spiritual strength power.

1355
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
You also get Shuriken that work like boomerangs.

1356
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You get different types of things that will freeze your enemies.

1357
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
The fire wheels. All kinds of neat stuff.

1358
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And even with that, no one can beat it. Sorry, it's impossible.

1359
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It just won't happen.

1360
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
I know people who have beaten it.

1361
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But I don't think Dan's beaten it.

1362
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I've gotten to the last fucking stage and there's a jump that is so hard.

1363
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It was controller-throwing, rage-inducing.

1364
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Alan knows what I'm like when I'm mad.

1365
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
That was one of them that made me mad.

1366
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
It's like you would jump.

1367
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Actually, if anyone wants to see the best rendition of how every gamer feels playing this game,

1368
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:05,000
look at the Angry Video Game Nerd's little video about this game.

1369
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That is everybody playing this game.

1370
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
My one difficult NES game triumph is that I beat the original Ninja Turtles NES game,

1371
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
which also has a rep for being hard as hell.

1372
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
You know, it's an American-made game.

1373
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I beat that twice and all the other times I couldn't get past the final boss.

1374
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
But yeah, ninja-gating is harder than that, so that's some scary shit.

1375
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Well, it was developed by Tecmo.

1376
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Another series back in the day that Tecmo did was Rygar,

1377
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
which I don't know if I've done on Classic Game before.

1378
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Rygar is a pretty good game.

1379
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Of course, Tecmo Bowl.

1380
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
So this one also had an arcade version that was a beat-em-up,

1381
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
but they weren't really ports of each other.

1382
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
They were kind of different.

1383
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
And the developer said that the term ninja was gaining popularity in North America,

1384
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
so that's why they made the game with the ninja in it.

1385
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And actually, the NES version was developed by Hideo Yoshizawa,

1386
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
who was listed as Sakurazaki in the credits.

1387
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:17,000
So you can see that if you look at the arcade credits and the NES credits,

1388
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
completely different development teams.

1389
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,000
So basically, that's where the differences came in with the two versions.

1390
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:35,000
So it's just really supposed to be more like you're playing along them,

1391
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
is what they were going for.

1392
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:44,000
That you were involved in the story of the game as well as playing the game itself.

1393
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So because the game's title was actually too difficult for English audiences,

1394
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
that's why they changed it to Ninja Gaiden.

1395
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And they were going to call it Dragon Ninja, but Ninja Gaiden just worked.

1396
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And it actually literally means ninja side story.

1397
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
But it's not intended to be a spin-off of the arcade version.

1398
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
God, I remember these bosses. Some of them were hard as fuck.

1399
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
The first two were easy mode, but then the third one is like, ah!

1400
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Sorry.

1401
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
This might surprise some people because I don't really talk about the new games,

1402
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
because I'm not nearly into the new games as much as I was the old ones,

1403
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
but I loved this old series as a kid.

1404
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I had this one, part two. My parents would never buy me part three.

1405
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:35,000
But I did get from a friend on Super Nintendo, they did a compilation.

1406
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Well, this game had so much featuring in Nintendo Power in 89 and 90.

1407
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It was on the March-April 89 cover and referenced in Howard and Esther.

1408
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I used to read a bunch of Howard and Esther, just saying.

1409
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And it was also in the May-June 1989 issue.

1410
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
It had complete walk-throughs. There was stuff in the counselor's corner.

1411
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It debuted number three in the top 30 list for July and August in 89,

1412
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
just behind Zelda 2 and Super Mario 2.

1413
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:12,000
You know what they need? Reg and Esther.

1414
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
No.

1415
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Just saying.

1416
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:21,000
So, I mean, basically, going back from this, in 2004,

1417
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Tecmo did episodic installments of Ninja Gaiden for the AT&T and Verizon phones

1418
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
that used the Brew and Java platform.

1419
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And the second installment was going to be released in North America,

1420
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:39,000
and it just didn't come out. They didn't keep up with it.

1421
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
And you know that magazine that Dan and I are into, Retro Gamer,

1422
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:49,000
which is a UK magazine, they did a review and a look back on Ninja Gaiden

1423
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:54,000
in the March 2004 issue, when the 2004 Xbox remake came out.

1424
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So, I mean, this game has really spawned a legacy.

1425
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,000
It gave us, you know, you keep going, and it's given us, like,

1426
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
we have characters that are alive.

1427
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And going from that, we've got the newer versions, which some are good

1428
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,000
and some are not, and the big, flowing red scarf.

1429
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:17,000
And there's also soundtracks. You can get the soundtracks.

1430
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
The first one came out in 1989. So, there you go.

1431
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, a real classic, Ninja Gaiden.

1432
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
On the NES, not to be confused with the arcade version,

1433
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
which I personally did not care for nearly as much.

1434
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It was just too different, as you touched on there.

1435
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
But I seriously recommend to everybody, when we're done with the show,

1436
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
go watch the Angry Video Game Nerds version of this.

1437
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
And then play Ninja Gaiden.

1438
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And then play it.

1439
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
And play the sequel.

1440
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And then scream.

1441
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And play the third one.

1442
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Because the second one introduces the Shadow Ninjas,

1443
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
which weren't in the first one.

1444
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I would like to see how bloody knuckles, you know, people get

1445
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
from punching the wall while playing this game.

1446
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Yeah. AcidicVampire in our chatroom says,

1447
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Heard the most recent Ninja Gaiden is shit.

1448
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yeah, that's what I heard, too.

1449
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I tried not to get into the new series as much, but I hear they're hard, too.

1450
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Is the latest one three or two?

1451
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I think it's three.

1452
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Okay.

1453
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Yeah, because each one got released, like, three times with the Black Omega Ultra Hyper Edition.

1454
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Sigma, yeah.

1455
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yeah, so.

1456
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Well, I remember it was a big deal because it was on Xbox One.

1457
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
The first Xbox first.

1458
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah.

1459
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
It was a big deal.

1460
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
All right, anyhow, we're going to take a break so we can, you know,

1461
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
do break-type things, like refill our drinks and all that stuff.

1462
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But don't go anywhere.

1463
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
There is plenty more to go when we come back with Orange Lounge Radio.

1464
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
We're going to have the FUGO Question of the Week, of course.

1465
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Your tweets at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1466
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
And you know what?

1467
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Last week, we didn't get to do any of our big segments because we were busy celebrating with the ten years and everything.

1468
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So I think we should play a game tonight.

1469
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
So we're going to do listless tonight when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1470
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Stay tuned.

1471
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1472
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:08,000
We are live on this Sunday night, July the 1st of 2012, with the 463rd episode of our show, taping live at vognetwork.com.

1473
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
If you're just now joining us live, well, hello.

1474
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Come on by the chat room and say hi at live.vognetwork.com.

1475
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
And if you're listening on the podcast, I hope you didn't fall asleep when I was talking about podcast check-ins earlier

1476
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
because now you can get vog points just for visiting vognetwork.com.

1477
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Log it in and put in your password.

1478
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
You might get some loot. You might.

1479
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
But we don't give away all the secrets on how to do that.

1480
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We're going to get into some rapid-fire news here and the FUGL question of the week and all that good stuff.

1481
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:43,000
But first, Alan, you're here on the show tonight, and I always like to let the guests plug things.

1482
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I know you don't run a website of your own or anything, but you do have something you do want to plug tonight, yes?

1483
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Yes, I'm selling off more video games, eBay batch.

1484
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So I was selling off duplicates. Now I'm selling off stuff that was once, you know,

1485
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
normally something I wouldn't part with, but make some extra money.

1486
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
No one's obligated to bid on it, but I thought the O.L. Army might want to see what I have up for grabs.

1487
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I'm going to put a link in chat.

1488
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Excellent.

1489
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
So eBay games.

1490
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
What kind of stuff are you selling, just to kind of give the impression?

1491
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Almost entirely handheld stuff. Game Boy Advance is the bulk of it.

1492
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Am I not coming through on audio?

1493
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:26,000
No, it's just the chat room. Sometimes you guys send me mixed signals because and you guys in studio don't.

1494
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,000
You're like a psycho girlfriend.

1495
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I don't want to sound mean, but don't always take what chat says at face value.

1496
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Multiple people have to say it before it's an issue.

1497
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And then when you guys get in on it, because one person is saying it in chat, I get really confused.

1498
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Two people have to say it in chat before it's really an issue because, like, I don't know.

1499
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I can only see the little waveforms going here so I could tell Alan's mic was off.

1500
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And I'm sorry, I ran away to turn on a light somewhere else so I didn't see that his stuff wasn't getting through.

1501
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, Rob.

1502
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
But anyway, now we got it. So I just totally ruined your plug.

1503
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
But that's what I do. I ruin your life. That's my role.

1504
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
So how do people find your auctions?

1505
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:08,000
There's a link in chat right now. It's a goog.goal link.

1506
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And also if you check the OLR Twitter feed, I don't know if you RT'd it, retweeted it.

1507
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
But if you check the Orange Sounds Radio Twitter feed and just scroll down if you're a podcast listener listening to this,

1508
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
they end Thursday nights. You've got four days.

1509
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I didn't retweet it on OLR because I was like, ooh, I shouldn't use the business thing for that.

1510
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
But it was on my personal Twitter. I just retweeted it at twitter.com slash SKIE.

1511
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yeah, so check Sky's Twitter. It should be a couple of posts down.

1512
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Okay, awesome.

1513
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And do we get some of the games named already? Sorry, I got confused with it.

1514
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Do we get some of the games that you are selling?

1515
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I haven't listed any of them off, but let me do that real quick.

1516
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I wish you had told me about some of these first.

1517
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I would have just given you straight up cash.

1518
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Final Fantasy 5 and 6, Game Boy Advance.

1519
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Those are the ones that have extra maps and espers and job classes.

1520
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Advance Wars 1 and 2, bundled together.

1521
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Four Swords, Game Boy Advance.

1522
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Final Fantasy 3 DS, Final Fantasy 2 PSP, Final Fantasy 4 DS, Elite Beat Agents,

1523
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Super Smash Brothers Melee GameCube, and Final Fantasy Legend 3 for Game Boy.

1524
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
That game is 20 years old.

1525
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I didn't tell you to name them all. God damn, I'm just kidding. It's fine.

1526
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
All right, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1527
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
RDGSinge says, do we get a discount if we mention OLR at the eBay checkout?

1528
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,000
No, and I have to make very clear, this money is going to Alan.

1529
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
This money is not going to OLR.

1530
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah, this is not some vog fundraiser. This is me just selling games.

1531
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
But he can plug his stuff because he's sitting here on the show tonight.

1532
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
However, I will say this, if you do mention OLR at checkout,

1533
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
we will throw in something small.

1534
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Like, we'll throw in something from the OLR vault here.

1535
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Just a something small little trinket.

1536
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Maybe an autographed picture of myself.

1537
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I'll give you something better than that.

1538
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I'm a vampire to know that Final Fantasy VI is super awesome,

1539
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
but I'm never going to play at Game Boy Advance again,

1540
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
and Final Fantasy VI is available four other different ways.

1541
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Plus, I have a Super Nintendo sitting right over there,

1542
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
and I'm pretty sure there's a Final Fantasy III cartridge somewhere,

1543
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
which is a pretty decent way to play it.

1544
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I realize it has the wrong number in front, but you know what? Deal.

1545
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
All right, let's get into some rapid-fire news, some quick news stories tonight. Loki.

1546
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
This shouldn't come as much of a surprise since we were just talking about

1547
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,000
all the trouble with the PC version of Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

1548
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
But yeah, Ghost Recon Arctic Strike, which was going to be the expansion

1549
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
for Future Soldier, has been delayed.

1550
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
It's not coming out this week like it was going to.

1551
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
They're citing polish as the reason to hold it up.

1552
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Yes, the polish or, hey, let's not release it with a million bugs,

1553
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
like with the PC version.

1554
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So, got out of the way.

1555
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
There's a new LEGO MMO coming.

1556
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Hopefully this one will last a little longer than the last one.

1557
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And it is coming from Funcom, so they kind of know their way around an MMO.

1558
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And they haven't really said exactly what this MMO is going to be,

1559
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
but they have some LEGO minifigs online,

1560
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
and it's going to be based on that franchise.

1561
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I didn't realize they had so many different LEGO minifigs.

1562
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
They actually have one with bunny ears and stuff and little red riding hood.

1563
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It's kind of crazy.

1564
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:44,000
So yeah, family-friendly game, and it's going to be coming out at some point.

1565
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
LEGO minifigs.

1566
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Well, since it didn't work the last time.

1567
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And then last but not least, there is a big action movie coming out this summer,

1568
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
and it doesn't feature Batman, but it features a whole ton of 80s action stars,

1569
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:02,000
including Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff like that.

1570
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The Expendables 2, and it is coming out as a video game,

1571
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
which was kind of leaked out before.

1572
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I think it was on the German's rating board and stuff like that.

1573
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:16,000
But it is going to be a PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade game and PC game

1574
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
coming out probably around the time of the movie.

1575
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It's a four-player co-op shooter, and I don't know, it looks neat.

1576
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I'm trying to see if this is more of like a...

1577
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I think this might be like an arcade-type game, you know?

1578
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Like a Time Crisis or something like that.

1579
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:43,000
And obviously it's based on the movie, which I saw the trailer for not that long ago.

1580
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
It's not like Time Crisis, but it's...

1581
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Man, it reminds me of the Nam game that they had on Neo Geo,

1582
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
where you have your character run across the screen.

1583
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It's sort of a shooter, but not.

1584
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Do you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character?

1585
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I don't know if you get to shoot Chuck Norris' character.

1586
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Seriously, fuck that guy.

1587
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Okay...

1588
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I don't like Chuck Norris. I don't. I think he's a fucking asshole.

1589
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,000
But that's my personal opinion. I'm allowed to voice it.

1590
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
He will hunt you down.

1591
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Fuck him! I'll take him on. He's like 70 years old.

1592
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Go break a hip.

1593
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I would never actually threaten physical violence against someone, disclaimer.

1594
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Alright, let's move on with some other news.

1595
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Valve...

1596
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You want to make some more in-game movies, things in Team Fortress 2,

1597
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
which, by the way, after last week, where I was like,

1598
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
oh, I want to play some more first-person shooters and stuff,

1599
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I'm probably getting more recommendations for Team Fortress 2 than anything else,

1600
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,000
just so you guys know.

1601
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
So I probably will have to check that out at some point.

1602
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:46,000
But anyway, Team Fortress 2 is one of the games that you can make movies with

1603
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
now with the Valve Source Filmmaker.

1604
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I guess one of the videos they were showing off was this Meet the Pyro video.

1605
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I haven't watched this myself yet.

1606
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
But the Filmmaker can make a movie out of any game that's running on the Source engine.

1607
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
So the Source movie maker uses the same assets as the game and all this stuff.

1608
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So it's like you don't actually have to play the game to make movies

1609
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
based off of the characters and all that.

1610
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
It's Machinima's wet dream.

1611
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
I can only imagine the fear that's in my heart

1612
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:20,000
hearing that they have this and Garry's Mod

1613
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
combined together into one pure evil cinematic adventure.

1614
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Half-Life 3 trailer, right?

1615
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
There's a ton of...

1616
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Not to bring up Mass Effect again,

1617
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
but people have ported the Mass Effect skins or the bodies into Garry's Mod.

1618
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So there are Mass Effect cartoons on YouTube made with Garry's Mod.

1619
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So anyhow, you can sign up for the Filmmaker beta

1620
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
at www.sourcefilmmaker.com.

1621
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
And I guess right now it's only really Team Fortress 2,

1622
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
but I'm assuming there will be other games later

1623
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
and plenty of fake Half-Life 3 trailers to hit the web soon.

1624
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Now if you're more of a Portal fan, Jamie,

1625
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
maybe this is something that will interest you.

1626
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
A Portal turret mini replica.

1627
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Don't you want a turret in your house, StarSakura?

1628
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You can get a blow-up turret.

1629
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Well, this is not a blow-up.

1630
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
It is an actual mini model of the Aperture Sentry turret.

1631
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It's a 16-inch tall.

1632
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
This company, Gaming Heads, is only making 350 of them.

1633
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
You can pre-order it right now for release in Quarter 4 of 2012

1634
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
for the low, low price of $330.

1635
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Rough, excuse me, $325.

1636
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So it's full-size, yes.

1637
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Yeah.

1638
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Not 60 inches, sorry.

1639
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I would just make one.

1640
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I've made one in Maya.

1641
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I've rendered one in 3D.

1642
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So, yeah, I don't know if it will actually shoot guns,

1643
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
but apparently it does have a sound module

1644
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
that plays the activation search, auto search, disabled,

1645
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
and all those sound effects.

1646
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Just trying to get to that baby.

1647
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Your funeral.

1648
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And lastly, some people are very excited about this MMO.

1649
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It's Guild Wars 2, and I gotta admit, I'm pretty curious.

1650
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I want to check it out.

1651
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
The launch date has been announced.

1652
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Get ready to lose sleep the night of Tuesday, August 28th.

1653
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
That is the day that Guild Wars 2 is launching.

1654
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
The next and final beta weekend event is planned for July 20th through 22nd

1655
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
if you want another little sneak peek,

1656
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,000
although I do believe you have to have pre-ordered the game to be in the beta,

1657
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
but you never know.

1658
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
You might have a friend or something that can show the game to you.

1659
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Tuesday, August 28th is the day that that launches.

1660
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1661
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Well, you know how there was that whole thing,

1662
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
the kusu that got the Minecraft Lego set made?

1663
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
There's Portal 1 now.

1664
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
It's got GLaDOS' chamber, the modular testing chamber with turrets,

1665
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
cubes, portal gun, and more.

1666
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
So you can go to lego.kusu.c-u-u-s-o-o.com.

1667
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Kusu, whatever.

1668
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I won't want to say kusu because that's Japanese for shit.

1669
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Slash idea slash view slash 18258 pound, as in the pound symbol.

1670
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Then Gunlord for Dreamcast.

1671
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Yes, there's still Dreamcast games being made,

1672
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
and you can get it for 40 bucks or you get a limited edition for 50 bucks.

1673
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
It has a dragon box for 120 bucks.

1674
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
So yeah, Dreamcast.

1675
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I love the Dreamcast shit.

1676
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
And then finally, Sony says that their new racing wheel

1677
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,000
is going to have double the accuracy of a DualShock.

1678
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And it's kind of a weird spaceship-shaped freaky-ass controller thing

1679
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
that uses the Move.

1680
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And that's how they're marketing it.

1681
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It's going to be 40 bucks.

1682
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Seriously, this thing is fucking weird.

1683
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It uses the Move as well, so if you don't have a Move,

1684
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
you've got to get one of those too.

1685
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
If you don't have a Move, you're SOL.

1686
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Just don't buy it.

1687
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
I mean, seriously, don't buy the steering wheel thing.

1688
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Let's be honest.

1689
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
How many more racing games that are going to utilize that

1690
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
are going to come out on the PS3 before the next system comes out?

1691
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Probably like one or two.

1692
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I'm linking this ugly-ass thing in the chat room.

1693
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
And, Ronma, if you'll please put this on our Tumblr,

1694
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,000
it's just completely hideous.

1695
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
All right.

1696
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
It looks actually kind of like a really weird sex toy,

1697
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
which the Move looks like anyway.

1698
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Let's get into the FUGL question of the week.

1699
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
It's my vehicle.

1700
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Every week, we ask you guys a question on Facebook

1701
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
and the same question on Google+.

1702
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Put them together, and you get FUGL.

1703
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
That's why we call it the FUGL question of the week.

1704
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And because I can't let this topic go,

1705
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
the question of the week this week was very simple.

1706
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
And the question is, what is a gamer?

1707
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And before we had the discussion at the top of the show tonight,

1708
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I wanted to know from the listeners what they thought

1709
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
before you whipped out the dictionary and all that.

1710
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
So let's see what the listeners...

1711
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And I purposely left it vague.

1712
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
I just wanted to get a very organic response.

1713
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So I guess we'll start on Google+,

1714
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
because unfortunately we usually have less answers there,

1715
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
because, you know, it's Google+.

1716
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
There's not a lot of people on it.

1717
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Let's see.

1718
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Ooh, we do have two answers.

1719
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Ooh, we have three answers on Google+.

1720
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Holy shit.

1721
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Okay, we're going to read them all.

1722
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,000
ActDeft says, a miserable pile of controllers,

1723
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
but enough of that.

1724
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Have at you.

1725
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Oh, I was hoping we'd get Castlevania jokes.

1726
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Seriously speaking, a gamer is someone who plays games,

1727
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
whether it's only one game or type of games or many.

1728
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
There are different types of gamers, though,

1729
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
like casuals and hardcore gamers.

1730
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
But if you play a game and like it

1731
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
and probably invest time and or money in it,

1732
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:35,000
then you're officially a gamer.

1733
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Let me be in line with what we were saying earlier.

1734
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Flaco Jones replied and said,

1735
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
anyone who games and is willing to identify themselves as a gamer.

1736
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I like that little kind of second twist there,

1737
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
willing to identify themselves as a gamer.

1738
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Maybe some folks on Facebook don't want to be gamers.

1739
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
They just want to play their Price is Right slots.

1740
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Surtur says, a gamer is someone that includes video games,

1741
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
phone, handheld, PC, and or console

1742
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
as part of their entertainment consumption.

1743
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
So does that mean like someone who budgets money for games?

1744
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Look at my house, gamer.

1745
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
All right, going to Facebook at facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1746
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Raginator says, a miserable sack of lies.

1747
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Oh, there it is, another Castlevania joke.

1748
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Oh, wait, never mind. That's the answer to what is a man.

1749
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Well, actually, it's a miserable little pile of secrets.

1750
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
But anyway, well, in simplest terms,

1751
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
a gamer is one who plays games regardless of the form they take.

1752
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Video games, CCGs, tabletop, pen and paper, RPGs, et cetera.

1753
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Usually, and more often than not,

1754
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,000
those that play video games pretty much come to mind first and foremost.

1755
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
You know, Raginator reminded me of the Twitter rant

1756
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I wrote on that whole conversation the first time it came up.

1757
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
And I said something about,

1758
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
this guy has probably never played Dungeons and Dragons second edition.

1759
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Come back when you've calculated a THAC0, bitch.

1760
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
I wanted to get a shirt that says I still know what my THAC0 is.

1761
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
They probably make those.

1762
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Do you know what it means, Bob?

1763
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
To hit Armor Class Zero.

1764
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Yes.

1765
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
All right.

1766
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Redthehaze says, it's a person who enjoys video games as a hobby.

1767
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I won't distinguish between who's hardcore or not,

1768
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
since that's very hipster douche sort of thing

1769
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
that was being done before it was cool.

1770
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
It's video games, it's for fun, and we should all get along.

1771
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I like his answer.

1772
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It's very hippie and non-hippie at the same time.

1773
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Get along or I will fucking kill you.

1774
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Kinda. I'm embellishing.

1775
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Picaruno says, I'd argue that there's no such thing as a gamer.

1776
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
It's as redundant a term as breather or eater,

1777
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
since everyone plays some form of game, whether you're aware of it or not.

1778
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Unless you're supremely boring.

1779
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Unless you play first person shooters, no offense.

1780
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I think he's being funny, not serious.

1781
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
There's mouth breather, but that's something different.

1782
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Porkchop says, obviously, a gamer is someone who plays games,

1783
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
but to go all Mr. Miyagi.

1784
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
A gamer has the ability to disconnect from reality,

1785
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
to travel to other worlds.

1786
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Whether it be to solve puzzles, explore uncharted lands,

1787
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
or battle formidable foes,

1788
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
a gamer can become one with their environment

1789
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
and achieve greatness through hard work and dedication among their peers.

1790
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Or something like that.

1791
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Somehow I just thought at the end of that statement there,

1792
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
it should be, and enjoy a book at your local library.

1793
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
It's like, something like that.

1794
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
It was a very zen answer.

1795
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It was very, like, then you see the caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland

1796
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
taking a big poof off the hookah.

1797
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Anyway.

1798
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Speaking, just to derail the show for a second.

1799
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Sure.

1800
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
One of the things on Kotaku they like doing

1801
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
is posting the really bad stock footage of gamers.

1802
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
And one of them had this nerdy chick on a couch

1803
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
playing a game, really weird,

1804
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
laying face first off the couch,

1805
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
and her friend is smoking a hookah that's not lit.

1806
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I just thought that was, like, why even have that?

1807
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Why would there need to be stock?

1808
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
I need a picture of a nerdy girl sitting awkwardly on a couch

1809
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
while her friend smokes a hookah.

1810
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I need this now as stock footage.

1811
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
They're high on life, Loki.

1812
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I'm still in my way. I need that.

1813
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Wicked replies and says,

1814
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Great musical, by the way. Thank you for commenting.

1815
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I feel that a gamer is someone who plays games,

1816
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
regardless of genre, platform, or even method.

1817
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I would consider people who are avid board game players gamers.

1818
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
They play games just like someone who plays World of Warcraft is a gamer.

1819
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
If it's an activity you enjoy, it doesn't matter the medium you enjoy it in.

1820
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
A gamer covers lots of ground,

1821
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
and the only true definition is someone who plays games.

1822
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Oh, excuse me, I have two more.

1823
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Tigerclaw says,

1824
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
A gamer is a person who plays not just video games,

1825
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
but all sorts of games, be it board games, the pen and paper,

1826
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
role-playing games, or card games.

1827
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Lastly, Chiggers says,

1828
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Here's the real short answer, one who games.

1829
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I think we can all accept that answer.

1830
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Thank you, everybody, for listening.

1831
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Well, thanks for listening, sure,

1832
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
but thanks for responding as well on Facebook and Plus.

1833
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Participating is the big word we use at VoG Network, yes, participating.

1834
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But contributing, too.

1835
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Stop giving me the death stare.

1836
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Why are you giving me the death stare?

1837
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I'm not giving you the death stare.

1838
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
You are giving me a little bit of death stare.

1839
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1840
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Hey, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1841
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
What?

1842
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Garrus.

1843
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Loki.

1844
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Well, that's like a new thing.

1845
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
The first ten years were rah, rah, rah, rah, what?

1846
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
The second ten years will be Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

1847
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Garrus.

1848
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Teehee.

1849
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Loki.

1850
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:52,000
So, apparently, Hollywood's next big idea to bring to theaters,

1851
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
since they're adapting all sorts of properties,

1852
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:01,000
be it board game and movie title or comic book or, you know,

1853
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
I don't know, all these reboots and stuff,

1854
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
now they're going to bring back Carmen Sandiego.

1855
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
As in, where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

1856
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Your journey into geography.

1857
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
You know a story like this is just begging for it.

1858
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
It is.

1859
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
It's just begging for it.

1860
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It is.

1861
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
It's begging for it.

1862
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
One, two, three.

1863
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Yeah.

1864
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Move up, move it, move it.

1865
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Is there really any movie needed?

1866
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I don't want to hear the dubstep version of this, though.

1867
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
No, nothing beats-

1868
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Actually, that would be kind of funny.

1869
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But, yes, they're planning on-

1870
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
No, we need to have a serious moment.

1871
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
This is a, for real, serious moment.

1872
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
I don't care if you have to blow all five of these men to get this to happen.

1873
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
This movie is null and void if that song is not in it.

1874
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Can we all agree on that?

1875
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
It's playing in the credits.

1876
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I mean, that credits is fine.

1877
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
You know, like, doesn't even have to be the first or second song in the credits,

1878
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,000
like the last song in the credits or second to last or-

1879
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Just have Carmen Sandiego be in New York City

1880
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
and these guys standing on the street-

1881
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
There's a hilarious cameo they could do.

1882
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
No, she shows up in Disneyland and it's the Dapper dance.

1883
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Yes, fine.

1884
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I don't care how you do it and I don't care if these guys have aged 20 years,

1885
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
get a new Rockapella.

1886
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
If they can keep doing Menudo over and over, then they can do new Rockapella.

1887
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I agree with SSJ100Matt.

1888
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Rockapella needs to be on standby at all times.

1889
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Here's the weird thing, though, about it, though,

1890
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
is it sounds like this is going to be based on-

1891
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Granted, it's been a very long time since I played the PC game.

1892
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I don't remember if you were also a-

1893
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I think, weren't you part of the ACME agency or something like that?

1894
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Yes.

1895
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Because she was part of the ACME agency

1896
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
and then she turned to Life of Grime or something like that.

1897
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
She went rogue.

1898
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
She went rogue.

1899
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Was there really a fucking backstory to Carmen Sandiego?

1900
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Yes, there apparently was.

1901
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I thought it was just like, we gotta capture this bitch.

1902
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Like, that was really-

1903
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
The old versions of the game, it's like, why are we looking for her?

1904
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
She's bad. Get her.

1905
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So-

1906
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
There was a whole story.

1907
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
There was a cartoon series and the cartoon series wasn't bad, I thought.

1908
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I played the crap out of Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego.

1909
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
But anyways, the story, it's being penned by Darren Lemke,

1910
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
who did Shrek Forever After and Jack the Giant Killer,

1911
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I guess that's coming out soon.

1912
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Sounds great.

1913
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,000
And then, of course, the movie involves Carmen Sandiego,

1914
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
who's turned from the greatest detective to an infamous criminal,

1915
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
and then her former colleagues try to hunt her down and she-

1916
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
they uncover a conspiracy and question whether Carmen is really a thief

1917
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
or a hero, which is stupid.

1918
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:58,000
And then, on top of that, you know, I think they were saying that,

1919
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:04,000
oh god, Jennifer Lopez is being targeted as the person to play Carmen Sandiego,

1920
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,000
and Angelina Jolie. Really, it needs to be Angelina Jolie.

1921
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I think that she looks the part.

1922
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
And Angelina Jolie would go topless.

1923
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Which, you know, there's nothing wrong with a little gratuitous nudity.

1924
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Now, I do believe that they're trying to make it a family-

1925
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
She's naked under that red trench coat.

1926
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
In my head, she always was naked under that red trench coat.

1927
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Now, I believe that they're trying to make it a little family-friendly,

1928
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
but I would be down for the topless, uncut edition.

1929
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Unrated, you know, family-friendly, or full-on big-breasted nudity.

1930
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Sounds wonderful to me.

1931
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Yeah, so I look forward to the success of this movie,

1932
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
and hopefully, you know, the Oregon Trail movie and Number Munchers the movie.

1933
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
So, yeah.

1934
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Hollywood is really out of ideas.

1935
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I think that's what we've come down to, is that they're out of ideas.

1936
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
You know what's sad, though?

1937
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
There was one essential character in the Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego TV show.

1938
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Oh, you're not going to be able to hear this.

1939
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It's very quiet on this movie here, but it's the Chief,

1940
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
if you can hear that in the background.

1941
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Remember the Chief?

1942
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
She was great.

1943
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
She was great, and she was a character in the video games that they had and everything,

1944
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
but unfortunately, that actress, Lynn Thigpen, she passed away a couple years ago.

1945
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
So, unfortunately, they would have to put somebody new in her role,

1946
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
or somebody old in her role.

1947
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Perhaps somebody from the Sim City series

1948
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
that could maybe do some news reporting or something like that.

1949
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Yeah, but that wasn't a sassy black woman.

1950
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I don't care. It's still all right.

1951
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It could be Samuel L. Jackson, a sassy black man.

1952
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Although, since race isn't an issue, if you want to talk about somebody old,

1953
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Betty White would make a great Chief.

1954
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Oh, I don't care. Just run her over with a truck.

1955
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Or one chick from the community.

1956
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,000
She's a sassy black woman that could play the role.

1957
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I think it'd work.

1958
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Or what's her name from Reno 9-1-1?

1959
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
She could... maybe.

1960
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Wanda Sykes, because, God, she can't be in more annoying roles out there.

1961
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,000
As the Chief.

1962
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Wanda Sykes is the Chief.

1963
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Oh, man, we probably should have done the list list tonight.

1964
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Sassy black woman you would have liked to have had as the Chief,

1965
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
but unfortunately we have a different topic tonight.

1966
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,000
That's a little specific.

1967
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Anyway, I was going to get the...

1968
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Old edutainment game that needs to become a movie.

1969
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Kathy Griffin, because she identifies as a strong black woman.

1970
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Turtle, the movie.

1971
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Vandy has a great one. Medea as the Chief.

1972
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
All right, and since you all brought it up,

1973
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:09,000
here's one actress who could be the new Chief from Sin City Action News.

1974
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Carol Davenport, here with a special report.

1975
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Tornado, big city, big hit.

1976
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Curse, trailer, the city animal park.

1977
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
God, forget it.

1978
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Lord Partly, my hair is ruined and I said to her, yes, you're dead.

1979
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
She literally just disappeared off the face of the earth.

1980
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,000
She's a great actress.

1981
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I mean, you know somebody was just standing there off camera

1982
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
with a tornado blowing it in her face,

1983
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
and she was doing all that acting for the tornado.

1984
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
It was just brava, brava, Carol Davenport, brava.

1985
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
And you know, back when I was kind of toying out the idea of FMV actors,

1986
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
where are they now?

1987
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
She is not easy to find.

1988
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
She isn't. I tried to find her too.

1989
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
That's the interview I want more than any other.

1990
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Find me. Find her and bring her to me.

1991
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,000
J100 Matt says he's still trying to track down Stephanie Fargo.

1992
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And Tiger Call recommended Zoe Saldana for Carmen Sandiego,

1993
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
and that woman needs to eat some tacos.

1994
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I like her, though.

1995
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,000
She needs to eat something.

1996
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I love her in Star Trek.

1997
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Well, yeah, but she still needs to eat.

1998
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Uhura had some back, sorry.

1999
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
All right, moving on.

2000
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
We're going to go topless wearing the world's Carmen Sandiego.

2001
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I'd even be fine with Mila Kunis doing the role.

2002
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I would pay to see that.

2003
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,000
She is a gamer, isn't she?

2004
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
She would be familiar with the subject material.

2005
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:40,000
And they've done fake topless with her, but it's time.

2006
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
It's time in your career to elevate it to the next plateau.

2007
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I mean, let's go.

2008
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
If Halle Berry could go topless and win an Oscar to say in.

2009
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
How would you work a topless scene in a Carmen Sandiego?

2010
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I would even be fine with Halle Berry doing topless chief, you know.

2011
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
She could be a sassy black woman.

2012
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
For me, I see Halle Berry's not very sassy to me.

2013
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I always picture monsters ball.

2014
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I don't know.

2015
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And then storm.

2016
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
But anyway.

2017
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
No, Natalie Portman would not make Carmen Sandiego, sorry.

2018
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Here's how you work a topless scene in the Carmen Sandiego movie.

2019
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Is that she's hiding out in Monaco at the beach.

2020
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Because I think that was a scene in, what was that movie with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo that was basically James Bond, but it wasn't.

2021
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
It was, um.

2022
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I'm not James Bond.

2023
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,000
It was a remake of an older movie. Somebody in chat will yell it out.

2024
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:39,000
But you had to have seen this movie because, I mean, Rene Russo was like 50 years old, you know, and she looked great.

2025
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
And she had no problem doing the nude sunbathing scene on the beach.

2026
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
And even, you know, again, I've said this before.

2027
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I'm very secure in my homosexuality.

2028
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
But I can appreciate a nice pair of tits.

2029
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
She had a great rack.

2030
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
She's just, I mean, come on, if Holly Berry's taking it off in Swordfish.

2031
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Swordfish! I mean, a movie that really didn't need that.

2032
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
But she did it.

2033
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Thank you! Acidic Vampire, The Thomas Crown Affair. That was it.

2034
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Uh.

2035
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Member?

2036
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Alright.

2037
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Anyhow.

2038
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
What are you snickering at over there, Darcy?

2039
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Oh, one of my friends posted one of those demotivational posters of two midgets getting into a fight.

2040
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
And it says, I have a feeling this is going to be a short fight.

2041
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
No.

2042
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Stop.

2043
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Alright.

2044
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Well, somebody thought this company would be a lot more short-lived than they really were.

2045
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
But they've lasted a long time.

2046
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
And it's Atari.

2047
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Atari is celebrating 40 years this week.

2048
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Or they did this past week.

2049
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
I didn't realize their birthday was the day after mine.

2050
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
But it is.

2051
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:45,000
40 years ago was when Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney got together and founded Atari.

2052
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
At the time, it was CIGI.

2053
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I guess that's what they wanted to call it.

2054
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
But they couldn't get that name.

2055
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So they went with Atari.

2056
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Great runner-up.

2057
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
So yeah, that's awesome.

2058
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,000
40 year anniversary for Atari.

2059
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
And yeah, they did a little infographic.

2060
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
1972 is when it was founded.

2061
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
That's when Pong came out.

2062
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Breakout was 76.

2063
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:13,000
The original Atari 2600 or the Atari VCS, 1977.

2064
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Let's see.

2065
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Of course, they don't mention the big video game crash in here.

2066
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Oh no, they do.

2067
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,000
1983.

2068
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Revenues dropped 97%.

2069
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Later on, the Atari greatest hits on the iPad.

2070
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Which, by the way, on the 40th anniversary, they just made all the games free.

2071
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
So I actually played.

2072
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I didn't talk about it in my gaming week.

2073
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Because, like, LOL, Atari 2600.

2074
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
But I played, like, Combat 2.

2075
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I played Sword Quest.

2076
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Which was an amazing...

2077
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
There was a Combat 2?

2078
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
It was a prototype that was never actually released.

2079
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And it's in that iPad one.

2080
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Is it any good?

2081
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
No.

2082
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Well, on the iPad, no.

2083
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
But if it had come out many years ago, yes.

2084
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Because, like, it's different.

2085
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Like, the terrain is different.

2086
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
There's trees, which is different colored blocks that you can shoot through.

2087
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
And it just, it kind of has a more natural look.

2088
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Kind of like River Raid.

2089
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
But combat.

2090
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Like, if that makes any sense at all.

2091
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
So, yes, Atari is 40 years old.

2092
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
And I thought, you know, to celebrate Atari's birthday,

2093
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:19,000
maybe we could throw them a listless party!

2094
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,000
That's right.

2095
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
We're going to play listless, which we haven't done in a few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2096
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
So let me explain how listless works with you guys.

2097
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
We are going to be coming up with the definitive list.

2098
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And it's a highly scientific process we go through.

2099
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
First, let me give you the topic.

2100
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Tonight's topic is,

2101
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:51,000
What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?

2102
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Because, let's be real, Atari slipped a little bit over the years.

2103
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Did any of you play Driver 3?

2104
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Did anybody actually own a Jaguar, besides Dark Sakura?

2105
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
No, I haven't owned a Jaguar.

2106
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Really?

2107
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Because the only two games that were good on it, I actually own on Sega Saturn.

2108
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:14,000
So anyhow, we want to do a topic, What could Atari do to be as relevant today as they were in 1982?

2109
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
What we're going to do, each of us will go around here in studio,

2110
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
myself, Loki, Dark Sakura, and special guest Alan tonight,

2111
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
and we're going to give our top three answers.

2112
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,000
And that's going to leave us with a list of 12.

2113
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
And then the hard part, it's not fun, but science isn't easy, you guys.

2114
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,000
It's not easy.

2115
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
So we're going to have to go around and each person will take one item off the list.

2116
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
That leaves us with a list of eight that those of you in our chat room,

2117
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:45,000
live at live.vognetwork.com, can vote on to make the definitive list.

2118
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Now if you guys have suggestions, yell them out in our chat room,

2119
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
because if one of our hosts decides they suddenly don't like one of the answers they wrote down before the show,

2120
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
or one of the answers gets duplicated, or they simply like your answer better,

2121
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
then they will use it and hopefully give you credit.

2122
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Unless they just happen to have wrote the same thing down already,

2123
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
because I see one of my answers already got written down in chat.

2124
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
So we'll see what happens.

2125
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Oops.

2126
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
It would help if I didn't leave the chat room.

2127
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,000
All right.

2128
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
I'm an idiot.

2129
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Okay.

2130
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Let's start the list.

2131
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Of course, I can't start the list until I open up WordPad.

2132
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
There we go.

2133
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
All right.

2134
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Let's start off the list.

2135
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Alan, you're the guest tonight, so you'll start us off.

2136
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Alan, your number three option.

2137
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:34,000
How could Atari be relevant today like it was 1982?

2138
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Combat as a Facebook game with real money microtransactions to rotate more than once a day.

2139
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I get it.

2140
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
So like the little turret in line with a true Facebook game.

2141
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,000
You have to turn once a day, but if you want to turn more, it's going to be like 50 cents.

2142
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Otherwise you'll be shooting to the right forever.

2143
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
It's like a broken arcade game from 1982 where you can't move left anymore.

2144
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
That's how it's going to play.

2145
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Bring combat to Facebook.

2146
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Bring combat to Facebook.

2147
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Didn't Atari actually bring some of their games to Facebook?

2148
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I think they might have, but Combat I don't believe was one of them.

2149
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
So the answer stands.

2150
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Dark Sakura.

2151
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,000
We'll let ladies go next.

2152
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Your number three answer.

2153
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Atari presents Pizza Time Theater the game.

2154
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I see.

2155
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Wasn't Chuck E. Cheese a one-time Pizza Time Theater?

2156
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
No additional.

2157
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I see.

2158
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
So what would happen in Pizza Time Theater the game?

2159
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
You'd vomit.

2160
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And you'd have to shoot the animatronics or the pizza gun.

2161
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Do the animatronics go bad at night?

2162
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:36,000
And then you'd have to run away from the employees and hide in the pole position machine so they don't give you out.

2163
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
All right.

2164
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Let's see.

2165
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Stupid helicopter.

2166
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I'll go next.

2167
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I'll let Loki go last.

2168
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
My answer for the thing that they could do.

2169
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Garrus 2600 is my answer.

2170
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:56,000
It would just be a brand new Atari 2600 game that is Garrus' face.

2171
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
And that's all it mouths things to you.

2172
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
And then that horrible, horrible 2600 chip.

2173
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
So Garrus 2600.

2174
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:07,000
All right, Loki, your number three answer for how could Atari be relevant today?

2175
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Marvel Madness 2.

2176
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Oh, a serious answer for Loki.

2177
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
That's a good one.

2178
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
That's a damn good answer.

2179
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Maybe a new Marvel Madness game.

2180
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It's awesome.

2181
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Well, sure, we did get Super Monkey Ball, but that's not right.

2182
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Not even close.

2183
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Marvel Madness 2.

2184
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
All right.

2185
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
So, so far, we have combat on Facebook, Pizza Time Theater, the game, Garrus 2600, and Marvel Madness 2.

2186
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Let's go to the number two answers.

2187
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Alan?

2188
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
You're setting something up in chat right now.

2189
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
What is this?

2190
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
I don't have the best relationship with chat when it comes to list lists.

2191
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I have a bad habit of eliminating their favorite answers.

2192
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
So they want to lynch me and I'm trying to tell them that if they message me, that won't happen.

2193
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
All right, fair enough.

2194
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Okay, your number two answer.

2195
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition for Steam, XBLA, and iOS.

2196
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,000
And how would Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition work?

2197
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Just meows and she'd bounce around in his little suit.

2198
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Instead of going boop, boop, it goes meow, meow.

2199
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So it would be meow, meow, meow.

2200
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
And the little Pong thing would leave Rainbow Trails.

2201
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Perfect, right?

2202
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Yeah.

2203
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
President Cat.

2204
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
All right.

2205
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Loki, or excuse me, Dark Sakura.

2206
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Your number two answer.

2207
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Working 5200 controllers.

2208
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Working 5200 controllers.

2209
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:41,000
If anyone has ever owned one or more Atari 5200, you know the controllers are shit.

2210
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:47,000
And even aftermarket controllers are kind of shit, if they just had real 5200 controllers

2211
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:55,000
that you didn't have to hold a screwdriver to the contact to get it to hit start on your damn game,

2212
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
then maybe the 5200 might have lived longer.

2213
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Maybe it might have caught on.

2214
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Because it has the best home version of Kix ever.

2215
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Can you tell that this is a sore point?

2216
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Maybe a little bit, just a little bit.

2217
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
All right, my answer is kind of similar to what we already heard, but it's what I wrote down.

2218
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I'm running with it.

2219
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:17,000
I said remake ET as a PlayStation Network Xbox Live Arcade game.

2220
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I had ET the extraterrestrial 30 year anniversary HD remake pre-order bonus via GameStop exclusive.

2221
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I was going to say remake Yars' Revenge, and then I was like, oh, wait, they actually did that.

2222
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
And, well, yeah, we're sitting here now.

2223
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:41,000
So I say ET, it was just misunderstood if they would just have made it a little more difficult

2224
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
to fall in those fucking holes.

2225
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I played the hell out of that game, and I was seven, and children are stupid.

2226
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
ET was not that bad.

2227
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
There were far worse games on the 2600, Pac-Man being one of them, excuse me.

2228
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:07,000
That game was shit.

2229
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:10,000
All right, at least ET had that cool neck thing.

2230
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,000
All right, Loki, your number two answer.

2231
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:20,000
My number two answer would be a sequel to Adventure in the Style of Skyrim.

2232
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Yeah, it's like Atari has the most generic fucking name for an RPG ever.

2233
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:33,000
They own that trademark, unless they sold it years ago, which is possible,

2234
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
but they could make a sequel to Adventure.

2235
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Because remember, there was adventure.

2236
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
That's true.

2237
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Wasn't there a prototype for Adventure 2?

2238
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
I want to say I've heard of one somewhere.

2239
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I think maybe.

2240
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I think there was.

2241
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:47,000
No.

2242
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Well, what they need is they need adventure with blood.

2243
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Like, when you kill those dragons, I want to feel it.

2244
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I want that shit that's in the Dawnguard expansion where swords go through heads

2245
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
and all that stuff and all that crazy, violent stuff from Skyrim.

2246
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Adventure with violence.

2247
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Okay, number one answer time.

2248
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Adventure 2 is on the 5200, and it was a proto.

2249
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,000
So I'm not crazy, but it was 5200, which far less people own than the 2600.

2250
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I've got two of them.

2251
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Give me one.

2252
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Alan, your number one answer for how could Atari be relevant like it was 1982?

2253
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,000
It was originally going to be the ET1, but that's yours now.

2254
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
So I'm going to say finish what Custer's Revenge started

2255
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:41,000
and find a way to break into the adult entertainment industry.

2256
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
You know, I think there's a hint of realness to that answer

2257
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:48,000
because it's like the one place that no one else would dare to go.

2258
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
But Atari could have a future in pornography,

2259
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
except maybe it could be less racist next time.

2260
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
That should have been my number three answer because it's more silly,

2261
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
but I was pressed for an idea.

2262
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,000
That's interesting.

2263
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Did you get that one from Chad, or did you make that up?

2264
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I made it up.

2265
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Good job.

2266
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
All right, Dark Soccer, your number one pick.

2267
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,000
You know this one because I said it before we even started this.

2268
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:14,000
A new console, the Atari 1090.

2269
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Why 1090?

2270
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I don't know.

2271
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
It sounds good.

2272
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
We had the 7800 and I was going to do the 1080, but I don't know.

2273
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
You've got ten extra points of definition.

2274
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:33,000
It's 1090 points of awesome Atari.

2275
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:37,000
So all those blocks will be super sharp and not too pickley.

2276
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,000
All right, my number one answer for how could Atari be relevant

2277
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:46,000
like it was in 1982, more Tempest 2000.

2278
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Yes, yes, I agree with that, Rob.

2279
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
More Tempest 2000.

2280
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
You know what, you should recharge my super zapper.

2281
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Yeah, they did Tempest 3000.

2282
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Yes, I do.

2283
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
That was supposed to be on the Jaguar.

2284
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I played it at Atari Party two years ago.

2285
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Nice.

2286
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Freaking awesome.

2287
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
But we need more Tempest 2000.

2288
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Heck yeah.

2289
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,000
It wasn't on 2600, it was on the Jaguar.

2290
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And the Sega Saturn.

2291
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
And then Tempest X was the PlayStation version.

2292
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
And it had the most awesome soundtrack that ever awesomeed.

2293
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I'll play you a clip later.

2294
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Seriously.

2295
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I'll play you a clip later.

2296
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
All right, but first we have to get the last answer.

2297
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Loki's number one answer.

2298
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Loki?

2299
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
A combat MMO done in the style of 2600,

2300
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
but you know, since they've got planes and tanks and stuff like that,

2301
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
imagine armies of tanks and planes and stuff like that

2302
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
fighting each other.

2303
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Kind of like the big open warfare that they have in Battlefield 3

2304
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:50,000
or something like that, but you know, with really like 4-bit tanks.

2305
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
I love it.

2306
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
I love it.

2307
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Combat the MMO.

2308
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Sure.

2309
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I had to shorten it, sorry.

2310
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
All right, so let's recap the list before we get to the eliminations.

2311
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Combat as a Facebook game to rotate more than once a day.

2312
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
I don't know why I wrote it that way, but that's what it says.

2313
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Pizza Time Theater, the game.

2314
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Garrus 2600.

2315
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Marvel Madness 2.

2316
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition.

2317
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
A working 5200 controller.

2318
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Remake ET as a PSNX PLA game.

2319
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Sequel to adventure a la Skyrim.

2320
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.

2321
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
A new console, the Atari 1090.

2322
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:34,000
More Tempest 2000 or Combat the MMO.

2323
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
This is a tricky one.

2324
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
These are all really good answers.

2325
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I don't know if I'm going to be able to eliminate one, but it's got to happen.

2326
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
It's part of the process.

2327
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,000
So, Allen, we start with you.

2328
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2329
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Oh, boy.

2330
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Let's see if I can do this without chat wanting to kill me.

2331
02:13:51,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I'm going to say Pizza Time Theater, the game, because I don't know what that is.

2332
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Oh, it's Chuck E. Cheese.

2333
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
But it is removed from the list.

2334
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
It's a hard one.

2335
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Well, Dark Soccer, you can get Revenge right here and take one of his off,

2336
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
but maybe you'll find one you want more.

2337
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2338
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Actually, Rob, I'm going to say Garrus 2600.

2339
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
What?

2340
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Because I don't want anything to mar my Mass Effect prettiness by pixelating it.

2341
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Sorry.

2342
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Garrus 2600.

2343
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I like my high-res Garrus.

2344
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Fine. Garrus 2600 is stricken from the list.

2345
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I'm going to remove Combat as a Facebook game because we kind of have two answers involving combat,

2346
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:51,000
and I think Artari is kind of already on Facebook and they suck, so that's not going to save them.

2347
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
It is stricken from the list.

2348
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Sorry.

2349
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Allen.

2350
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Oh, he already removed.

2351
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Never mind.

2352
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Loki, your turn then.

2353
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

2354
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,000
The Atari 1090 because I don't know what the hell that is.

2355
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
You don't understand where the extra 10 is.

2356
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I don't know.

2357
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,000
All I see it as is a lot less powerful than the 2600.

2358
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
All right.

2359
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
That could be bad.

2360
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I think I have an extra zero.

2361
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Sorry.

2362
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
This half of the screen is black.

2363
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,000
This half of the screen is white.

2364
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Oh, wait, they switched.

2365
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Something's happening.

2366
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,000
All right, it is stricken from the list.

2367
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
So here we go.

2368
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
This is what I'm going to post into chat.

2369
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
You're going to send a private message to Sky in chat if you're listening live.

2370
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Type slash MSG space SKIE space your number one and number two answers.

2371
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
We will tally them up.

2372
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Here we go.

2373
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Marble Madness 2, Pong Ultra HD Remix President Cat Edition, Working 5200 controllers,

2374
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Remake ET is a PSNX BLA game, Sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim, Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming,

2375
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
More Tempest 2000 or Combat the MMO.

2376
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
There it is.

2377
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
We're going to tally up your votes and we will read the answers a little later in the show.

2378
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:14,000
First, let me read some of the answers that the chatters came up with here.

2379
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Frisbee says bring back those sword quest games with the contest they had in them.

2380
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
That was epic stuff.

2381
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,000
I was debating suggesting a finally put out the last two Earth Quest, Water Quest, Fire Quest games.

2382
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Because they only put out the first two and then the system went under.

2383
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:35,000
The third is available on some of the retro collections like on the iPhone one as like a retro or a prototype type thing.

2384
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,000
So you can play the third one but the fourth one doesn't exist.

2385
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
For real.

2386
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So let's see.

2387
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Moving on.

2388
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Let's see.

2389
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Tiger Claw says remake Pac-Man 2600 with better graphics.

2390
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Well that would be Pac-Man.

2391
02:16:53,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Legend of Zaku says ET remake with new super secret level where ET and Elliot recover the surplus codes or surplus copies from the New Mexico landfill where they lie today.

2392
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
That's a good answer.

2393
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Better yet, the cartridges come back as zombies.

2394
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
They rise from the grave.

2395
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Rise from your grave.

2396
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
ET kill.

2397
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Hey, here's a bit of trivia for you.

2398
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
What?

2399
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
ET's design was based off of a hairless, earless cat.

2400
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Really?

2401
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yes, really.

2402
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I remember back in the day watching an HBO special with my mother and they showed how the sketches of a cat and then it was naked and everything.

2403
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Well it does explain how he had so much control over Elliot then.

2404
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Although I don't remember him coughing up any hairballs.

2405
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Because he was naked.

2406
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
He didn't lick himself.

2407
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
But he could have licked other people.

2408
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Alright.

2409
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Let's get back into the news.

2410
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Dark Soccer, I think we left off with one of your stories.

2411
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
You did? I forgot.

2412
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Yeah.

2413
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
How about something about Yu Suzuki?

2414
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Okay, sure.

2415
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,000
He's announced a smartphone game called Gan Gan Pirates.

2416
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Yay.

2417
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:09,000
It's a pirate themed arcade style shoot-em-up that is also competitive and cooperative multiplayer.

2418
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
And it will be free to play.

2419
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Launches in Japan for iOS and Android in September.

2420
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,000
And who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and get it over here too.

2421
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,000
But nothing quite yet.

2422
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Who knows?

2423
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Gan Gan Pirates.

2424
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Is this a game you want to play?

2425
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
If it's Yu Suzuki, heck yeah.

2426
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:32,000
You know I have a photo of him and my husband.

2427
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Yes, you have that up on your wall very proudly.

2428
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Yes.

2429
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Good times.

2430
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Loki?

2431
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:43,000
So EA's come out making bold claims and I don't know.

2432
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
They keep coming out.

2433
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Listen, if you're a company that's kind of the number two company right now as far as

2434
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
digital distribution goes, stop dogging on number one because, you know, going out there

2435
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
and saying, hey, we're gonna be better than Steam.

2436
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
We're gonna do things Steam doesn't do.

2437
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Like, not put things on sale.

2438
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
How you like that shit?

2439
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
I mean, it's come out sounding stupid.

2440
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,000
We're gonna take everything that makes Steam successful and not do it and we're gonna kick

2441
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,000
their ass.

2442
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Fourth of July sale on Steam this week.

2443
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Just saying.

2444
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Let's pray.

2445
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Prayer circle.

2446
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Did it really start?

2447
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
I know it hasn't started yet.

2448
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Let's form a prayer circle, everybody, for a kickass Steam sale.

2449
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Actually, maybe that shouldn't happen because I'll end up spending a hundred dollars on

2450
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
a game.

2451
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I thought the prayer circle was gonna be that they don't have a kickass sale so that

2452
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
we don't waste all of our money on it.

2453
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Yeah, that's true.

2454
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
That's true.

2455
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
But anyways, so yeah.

2456
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
They've basically said they want to be the Facebook of digital distribution compared

2457
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:44,000
to Valve's MySpace.

2458
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,000
First off...

2459
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

2460
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Yeah, it is the stupidest thing ever.

2461
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
They're basically...

2462
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
It's not gonna fucking happen, okay?

2463
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:59,000
You're gonna talk all this shit but no one is gonna fucking go to Origin over Steam.

2464
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I mean, granted, you're saying, oh, hey, look.

2465
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:07,000
You know, look at how well Origin's doing because all these people are signed up on

2466
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
it.

2467
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
And all your fucking EA games require it.

2468
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Even the ones that aren't even on PC.

2469
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
You have to have a fucking Origin login.

2470
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:22,000
So, yeah, you have a lot more users or people that are signed up.

2471
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
It doesn't mean they're fucking buying things up.

2472
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Well, to be fair, Valve did the same shit and we all let it slip by.

2473
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Yes, but how many games does Valve release versus how many games EA releases?

2474
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Valve games are like once in a decade.

2475
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I don't know.

2476
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
It's a fucking event.

2477
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Yes, exactly.

2478
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Yeah, because when Valve did it with Half-Life 2, no one knew what the fuck Steam was and

2479
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
people were pissed about it.

2480
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:47,000
But we've all forgiven them because they're Valve.

2481
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And Steam, of course, took a couple years to become fucking awesome, so Origin is still

2482
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
a turd.

2483
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Yeah, but it's the turd that I'm hoping puts Mass Effect 3 on sale Tuesday.

2484
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Okay, so let me quote what they said here.

2485
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
EA is really in an interesting place.

2486
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:11,000
We have this bar that is set so high so that whether it is any of our games or services,

2487
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
we want to be 90 plus Metacritic at everything.

2488
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Origin is moving in that direction.

2489
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
We are not there yet.

2490
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
We understand that, but we're going to get there soon.

2491
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Then fucking stop talking shit like your top dog and said, you know, eat your humble pie.

2492
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And also, another thing, maybe you shouldn't start comparing yourself to Facebook because

2493
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
people don't fucking like Facebook.

2494
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I mean, granted, people really don't like MySpace, but Facebook, it's not exactly favorable.

2495
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
So what are you going to do?

2496
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:48,000
MySpace is getting into that I love the 90s type of thing, or better yet, I love the 70s

2497
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:52,000
or something where it's like, oh, remember when everybody had a pet rock?

2498
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I'm not exactly going to go out and buy a pet rock, but I look back on it with fond

2499
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,000
memories.

2500
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Remember when people used to post blingies on your profile and they were funny?

2501
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
That's MySpace.

2502
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
That was never attractive, Rob.

2503
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
That was never attractive.

2504
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,000
It was always hilarious.

2505
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:13,000
But seriously, what are they going to start doing on Origin?

2506
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Are they going to start adding these at origin.com email addresses and stuff like that without

2507
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:25,000
telling you and making those public so people can message you without you knowing them?

2508
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Are they going to start throwing out your phone number to everybody?

2509
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,000
I mean, Facebook's kind of being known lately with changing things when you don't want them,

2510
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:42,000
or changing things that don't need to be changed, like not throwing sales, and also for leaking

2511
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,000
your personal information out there when you really don't want it.

2512
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:52,000
So, maybe you should consider not comparing yourself to that.

2513
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:57,000
And then also not comparing yourself to the top provider of anything until you become

2514
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
the top provider of that.

2515
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Just saying.

2516
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Just saying.

2517
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I mean, obviously, yes, we aim to be better than our competition.

2518
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Cool.

2519
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,000
But don't talk so much shit until you have something to back it up with.

2520
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
All right.

2521
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Before we get into the listless results and the mailbag tonight, let's get into one more

2522
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
story here about Blizzard, because they make some pretty popular PC games.

2523
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I don't know if you've ever heard of Diablo, but that is kind of a big deal.

2524
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Or World of Warcraft.

2525
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:33,000
But anyhow, Blizzard has told us about what games will be coming to Gamescom 2012.

2526
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Mists of Pandaria will have its opening cinematic debuted, and there will be a hands-on demo

2527
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
there.

2528
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Also, multiplayer for StarCraft II Heart of the Swarm.

2529
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Also, Diablo III will still be there in full display and all that, but they're not really

2530
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:52,000
announcing anything with Diablo III.

2531
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:58,000
The other thing I want to say is that Gamescom 2012 is August 16th through 19th.

2532
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:04,000
A lot of people theorizing that Mists of Pandaria's release date clearly will not be before that,

2533
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,000
but probably won't be long after that, because if they were debuting the cinematic, then,

2534
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
well, shit, the game's not out, obviously, before that.

2535
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
So a lot of people are theorizing at this point late September for the Mists of Pandaria

2536
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
expansion.

2537
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:22,000
So it wasn't a full year of having to raid Dragon Soul, but pretty fucking close.

2538
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Just saying.

2539
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Anyhow, let's open the mailbag.

2540
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Every week, we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2541
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,000
And DarkSakura dives in the mailbag headfirst, pick a few of her favorite emails, and reads

2542
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:40,000
them for you live on air.

2543
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Eh.

2544
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Okay.

2545
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:47,000
First email.

2546
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Howdy.

2547
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
First of all, a belated congratulations on your 10-year anniversary.

2548
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:54,000
It's not a late congratulations.

2549
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
One year, I got a card for my birthday, which is in August, when I visited my grandparents

2550
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
for Christmas.

2551
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
That is late.

2552
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Anyway, like many lemmings, I've been following the news of Microsoft Surface announcement.

2553
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,000
At first, I didn't think much of this announcement, then it dawned on me.

2554
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:12,000
If pulled off correctly, Microsoft Surface can do what tablets, netbooks, and the iPad

2555
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
have been able to do.

2556
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Bring PC titles to the portable market.

2557
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Now, I'm not talking about the latest and greatest titles, but games from several years

2558
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
ago that people can still appreciate.

2559
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Hell, if they could get a good version of The Sims or while working on the thing, Microsoft

2560
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Surface can take off.

2561
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Stay black, Retertainment, Garris.

2562
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Sent from my iPad.

2563
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,000
So clearly, he's interested in the Surface if he sent it from his iPad.

2564
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Unless that was a joke, I don't know.

2565
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
The Surface, the press conference was a little bit of a letdown.

2566
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I think we were expecting something bigger.

2567
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:48,000
For me, I have one of the new iPads now, so I'm not really interested in the tablet for

2568
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,000
another three years at least.

2569
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,000
They do some interesting things with it, that's for sure.

2570
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:57,000
And I mean, if I was going to buy a tablet, I would probably get one of those.

2571
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:02,000
But at the same time, I think they're going to be pretty expensive since they haven't

2572
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
announced price or dates yet.

2573
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Although, that new Google tablet does look pretty nice.

2574
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Yeah, I was hearing about that too.

2575
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
But I'm tableted out.

2576
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Well, we actually were looking at the Nexus because Dan got the phone and he loves it.

2577
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
So we're sort of thinking about that tablet.

2578
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:25,000
But anyway, so the next email comes from RDGSinge.

2579
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
So small news for those into Final Fantasy Tactics Advance.

2580
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,000
A recent fan-made patch was released that removes a set of in-game rules called laws

2581
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
allowing the player to play in more inventive ways.

2582
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
And you can find an article on that on romhacking.net.

2583
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Okay, cool.

2584
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Next email.

2585
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Hey, OLR, this is Blade3 AKA The Honey Badger.

2586
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
What, because you don't give a fuck?

2587
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I just wanted to say congratulations on your 10th anniversary and so sorry I cannot participate live.

2588
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Also, I was chatting through Steam with Nick Crafter from Video Game Show, another show

2589
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
syndicated by All Games.

2590
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
I told him about VoG and how I wanted him to get in contact with you guys because

2591
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:08,000
VGS is a great show and I told him it would be cool to see another great show featured on VoG.

2592
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
So I told him I would contact you guys to help expedite the process.

2593
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I hope you would consider their show for your network and if so, thanks very much.

2594
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:23,000
You guys show kicks ass along with the entire VoG network.

2595
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Although we appreciate the referrals and so forth and we do think if you know of a great show

2596
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:32,000
that ought to be on the VoG network, you should let us know.

2597
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Do remember that, and I'm putting this out there as a generality for everything,

2598
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:40,000
not specifically this email, but this email triggered a little thing in my head like,

2599
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
oh, I need to say that on the show at some point.

2600
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Do remember the only people authorized to speak on behalf of the VoG network

2601
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:53,000
are the hosts of this show, Bobby Black Wolf Show, and sometimes hosts of other shows

2602
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
depending on the network already, depending on what the topic is.

2603
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:01,000
But if you really want to talk to somebody in charge, you need to talk to one of us or Bobby.

2604
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:07,000
So just putting that out there because I don't ever, ever, ever want somebody to promise something

2605
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:10,000
on behalf of VoG we can't deliver on.

2606
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
I just want to make that very clear.

2607
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I'm not saying no in this case, but I can say we are looking for more stuff than just video games.

2608
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Although I am familiar with this show and it's a pretty kick ass show and I'd be happy to work with them in some capacity.

2609
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:35,000
But we'd definitely like more shows on like, you know, comic books, movies, other nerd culture things,

2610
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,000
especially like particular series and things like that, other parts of fandom would be great

2611
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
because we are really trying to expand the geek network.

2612
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Okay. PS, I have been listening since 2004 when I got my first iPod, the iPod mini.

2613
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:56,000
I have grown up on your show as I was only 10 years old when I began listening and I am now 18.

2614
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Thanks for everything. I cannot tell you what it would be like without your show.

2615
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Aww.

2616
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Aww, that's very sweet.

2617
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I feel kind of old, kind of.

2618
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Okay, last email.

2619
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Hello, OLR Crew. Some random questions and topics of interest for you.

2620
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Number one, a few weeks back Dark Sakura brought up Hatsune Miku Project Diva for Vita,

2621
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
making an appearance at this year's E3 convention.

2622
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Few websites had mentioned a Sega rep state of the game could be localized if there was an interest.

2623
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I tried to contact Sega's community folks but got no response.

2624
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:35,000
What do you think could be done to get Sega's attention on bringing Project Diva over here?

2625
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Hit them on Twitter, hit them on Facebook, hit them through the forums, get other people to do it too,

2626
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:47,000
and why not make a stupid online petition? I don't know.

2627
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:55,000
But I mean, get enough people to say something to them. Start a Facebook community.

2628
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Get out there and pick it with signs.

2629
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Yeah.

2630
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Facebook is a pretty decent way to be visible in this day and age, and that's not a bad idea.

2631
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Because that also gives them numbers, which they can then take back to management and say,

2632
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:19,000
look, 15,000 people want this game, and that'll help. Anyhow.

2633
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Next email?

2634
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Next email is from, no, not next email, there's more to this email.

2635
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,000
There were more questions, Rob, jumping to conclusions.

2636
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
For shame, for shame.

2637
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:37,000
What is everyone's thoughts on Microsoft Surface? I have no thoughts on this.

2638
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Oh, didn't we just talk about that a little bit?

2639
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
We did, so we can move on.

2640
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Defer to the prior conversation.

2641
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Okay, Sky.

2642
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Uh-oh.

2643
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Since you express interest in first-party shooters, do give Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 a try on PC.

2644
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Age of Team Fortress 2's nine classes have play styles that don't always rely on having pinpoint accuracy.

2645
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,000
On the other hand, Left 4 Dead 2 should help you improve your aim a bit.

2646
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
I have played a little bit of Left 4 Dead 1, and it was fun.

2647
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Alan and I played that a little bit, right Alan? And we had some good times with that. Left 4 Dead.

2648
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I was really, really bad at it. It was kind of fun.

2649
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Have a good evening and may a visit to Pinkberry be in your futures, and that comes from the Nasty Canasta.

2650
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,000
P.S., Garris, and Tali, too.

2651
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:25,000
And there are no more emails.

2652
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Alright, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us another email for a future week.

2653
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Alright, let's do a few more stories. Oh, no, the FUs of the week.

2654
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
We gotta get our angst out.

2655
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
It's time to get ranty.

2656
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Why? Because we can.

2657
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Music

2658
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:06,000
FU'd a gluten for making me freaking sick all day yesterday, to where I couldn't even leave the house.

2659
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I bet the pizza was so good.

2660
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Alan.

2661
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:19,000
So once my new job starts and I'm fully trained and I'm actually allowed to do it by myself, it's like super late night shift depending on how shitty things are.

2662
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:27,000
So won't be able to leave work until possibly 11 or midnight, which means I'm going to have to get a car at some point.

2663
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Someone's not going to pick my ass up all the time that late when they have a morning job.

2664
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:37,000
So I guess FU'd a the reality that I might have to have a car and a license by the end of the year.

2665
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
You should get a Vespa.

2666
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:43,000
And yes, I know that I'm nearly 34 with no license in a car and there's a very long history behind it.

2667
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Like my family never had a car growing up and I just thought that it's expensive and scary and shitty.

2668
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Now I finally have to do it.

2669
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Well, like I told you before, my mom had a lot of the same thoughts you did.

2670
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
And she didn't end up getting a license until she was 37 and pretty much had to.

2671
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
But she takes back roads everywhere. She doesn't have to touch the freeway.

2672
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Growing up in the East Bay and on the peninsula of San Francisco, the transit is a joke compared to New York.

2673
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:14,000
But it was good enough that I made it work. Up here in Sacramento, transit sucks.

2674
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Alright, Loki.

2675
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Fuck you to the sudden bursting water pipe that we had at our house.

2676
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Thankfully we caught it right when it happened, so there wasn't any damage.

2677
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:37,000
But still, the whole process is fucking annoying. We had a giant dehumidifier, which is the size of a small fridge.

2678
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And it sounds like a loud can opener.

2679
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I was reading about that on Nellie's Facebook and yours. Sorry that happened to you guys.

2680
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,000
No, at least we were home because she was about to leave.

2681
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:53,000
And I had talked to some people that they were not home when that happened and that was not fun.

2682
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Alright, let's see. My FU of the Week goes to the fact, this is easy, the fact that I was sick on my birthday.

2683
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:06,000
That's right. I don't know how, but I caught some type of sinus-y infection thingy.

2684
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,000
You might hear it in my voice still, actually. I sound a little different tonight.

2685
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I've been trying to kick this for about a week, which included on my birthday.

2686
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:16,000
So thank you, Mother Nature, for that little present. Really appreciate it.

2687
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Speaking of presents, just to let you know, I've got presents coming for both of you.

2688
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,000
I have to finish making them.

2689
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Very cool.

2690
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,000
But there are presents coming and they are for you both.

2691
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Aww, yay.

2692
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,000
The next O.L.R. is going to be on my birthday.

2693
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Oh my god. Oh shit, that means I can't do it, huh?

2694
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
No, we don't have to do anything out for my birthday.

2695
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
We'll figure something out. We'll do it before or after.

2696
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
But I'll have to bring it then.

2697
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:44,000
You'll probably have to work anyway. Oh wait, no, maybe not on the 8th.

2698
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Yeah.

2699
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Oh well, we'll figure something out. We'll throw a party on air just for you.

2700
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Maybe you'll have to come right back next week.

2701
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Wicked says F you to being bad at cataheroics.

2702
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And I'm sorry, I shouldn't have been so mercenary in saying how could anyone die on Benedictus.

2703
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Because I have been in a failed party that died on Benedictus.

2704
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Not through anything I did, through everybody else sucking.

2705
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Only the well players know what I'm talking about.

2706
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Just make sure you don't stand in stuff and dodge the waves. Be aware.

2707
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I have an F you to add.

2708
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:20,000
What?

2709
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:23,000
To the um, to the add on GTFO for being annoying.

2710
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Me! You're standing as shit. Me!

2711
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
You need to tell it to GTFO.

2712
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:32,000
I thought it would help and it just was annoying.

2713
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Alright, let's get to the listless results.

2714
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:41,000
You've all been dying to hear it. What is the definitive answer, kids, to the list?

2715
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Thing that Atari 2600, or excuse me, Atari in general, could do to be relevant like they were in the 2600 days.

2716
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,000
How could a 40 year old company be as relevant as they were in 1982?

2717
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
Here it is, the top three answers.

2718
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:58,000
As mentioned, nominated by the host and voted on by chat.

2719
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Number three.

2720
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Number three answer is.

2721
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Finish what Custer's Revenge started and break into adult gaming.

2722
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Yay!

2723
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Y'all are pervs.

2724
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Number three answer.

2725
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
The number two answer tonight.

2726
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Marble Madness 2.

2727
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
That's the game people want.

2728
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
That's definitely a game people want.

2729
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
And the number one answer.

2730
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
What do you most want?

2731
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:28,000
A sequel to Adventure a la Skyrim.

2732
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:32,000
That is what will save Atari's ass.

2733
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:35,000
And I still say it could be a launch title for the Atari 1090.

2734
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I do.

2735
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,000
So there it is.

2736
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Your top three answers.

2737
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Thanks for playing.

2738
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Here's a lifetime supply of turtle wax.

2739
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Alright, let's move on.

2740
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:48,000
And Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco Treat.

2741
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,000
The other thing they could do that would be kind of funny is like an arcade game that's basically an Atari 2600.

2742
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:57,000
But you know how they have that giant Tetris machine with the controller that's really huge?

2743
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
You do one even better.

2744
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:02,000
My god, I played that at Golf Land like a week or two ago.

2745
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:03,000
I think it was scary.

2746
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:09,000
The Atari 2600 controller is really simple. It's just a giant button and basically a giant joystick.

2747
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,000
So you have this giant foam joystick that you can kind of swing on or whatever in a giant button.

2748
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
So you play 2600 games on a giant screen with the giant controller.

2749
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
It would be funny.

2750
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
A giant 2600. That would be great, actually.

2751
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Hilarious.

2752
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Alright, so we talked a little bit about the Wii U and of course there's all different companies promising to bring various games to the platform.

2753
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:44,000
One of which is actually, well, they do have a game coming to the Wii U at launch.

2754
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Their Ninja Gaiden 3 is getting a port, but Team Ninja is also thinking about Dead or Alive 5 for the Wii U.

2755
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:55,000
And that makes sense because if you think about it, you know, they're doing Ninja Gaiden 3.

2756
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:05,000
There's already Tekken Tag Tournament 2, so it wouldn't be that difficult to port a game over, I think, from the PlayStation 3 or 360 to the Wii U.

2757
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:12,000
And they're saying right now we're doing our best to get ready for PlayStation 3 and 360 for the version of Dead or Alive 5.

2758
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:21,000
But we want to hear what players think about the Wii U version or if they'd be interested in it.

2759
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:31,000
So, I could see that happening, especially with a Game of the Year edition or something like that. They could do it.

2760
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
That could be pretty awesome, actually. You know, because it's a fun series.

2761
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,000
It's always hilarious in this day and age to see very adult games on a Nintendo platform.

2762
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
I'd be curious what the tablet would be for. How about Boob Cam?

2763
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Well, they do have photo mode.

2764
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Do they?

2765
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Yes, they do.

2766
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Nice.

2767
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:58,000
And remember, not only do they have photo mode, but I believe this game had transparent clothing.

2768
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Like, you could actually get, like, water or something like that on different parts of the clothing and it would be, you know, the correct transparency and stuff like that.

2769
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Or, um, maybe it was ripping clothing. Something to the effect of you see more boobies.

2770
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Do you think Team Ninja would feel burned at all over the reception over Metroid Other M or do you think it's kind of like, eh, you know?

2771
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:29,000
I think if anything, they're going to be more burned at the fact that Ninja Gaiden 3 sucks and that, you know, it's going to be launched out for the Wii U and people won't give a shit.

2772
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Aw.

2773
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Sorry. Unless they go back and fix the game, I don't think people are going to give a shit.

2774
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Alright. One more news story for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to add us on Skype.

2775
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Do remember, we appreciate if you check Echo 1-2-3 first before using Skype.

2776
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:02,000
But you can also, and, you know, think outside the box, you can also use Skype on a Vita, you can use Skype on an iOS device or I'm pretty sure Android has it too.

2777
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Many ways you can install Skype and call the show or you can just pick up a damn telephone.

2778
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:10,000
If you still have one of those telephones on your wall with a rotary dial, it will work.

2779
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:15,000
1-877-GAME-OLR. You just will probably have to dial a lot.

2780
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
So get your finger ready.

2781
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:21,000
But first, one more story and this has to do with Retro City Rampage.

2782
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Some folks looking forward to this game because it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto.

2783
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,000
God, when the hell is that coming out?

2784
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
If it was on the NES.

2785
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:34,000
No answer, but what I can tell you, it's going to support cross-play on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

2786
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:41,000
So, meaning if you buy it on one platform, you get it on the other and you can play across the two.

2787
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Well, do you get it on the other or do you have to buy both and then you can play?

2788
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Nope, you get one and you unlock the other.

2789
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Sweet!

2790
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
That's awesome.

2791
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,000
One payment, both versions.

2792
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Hooray!

2793
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:54,000
I know, I will be getting it for the Vita.

2794
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,000
As reported by IndieGames.com, it's the pay once, cross-play deal.

2795
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Said by, who is this guy?

2796
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Martin Turton, who's with Clever Beans, putting this game out.

2797
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Quote, we think that the appeal of the buy once deal, which should hopefully attract more people to buy the game,

2798
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:17,000
far outweighs any extra sales we might get from people who are prepared to buy the game twice.

2799
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Especially considering that require two separate purchases would be likely to cause a fair backlash.

2800
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Basically, we want to price the game in a way that would attract us to buy it ourselves.

2801
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Very interesting tactic.

2802
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:32,000
They're basically saying, you know what, yeah, we could double dip people.

2803
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:38,000
But if we don't and we make it free, it's going to attract more people to the game because it's like, hey, free game.

2804
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Well, I was originally going to get it on 360, although I might still buy it on PlayStation Network and 360 because it could be fun.

2805
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I don't know, we'll see.

2806
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Start with the Vita.

2807
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
So that's pretty cool.

2808
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
So good job on you, Retro City Rampage.

2809
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Some good news to end with tonight.

2810
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
We're going to open up Skype line.

2811
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,000
It's open.

2812
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,000
If you want to call, do it now.

2813
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:10,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2814
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
I'm logging into Twitter right now.

2815
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I was on the wrong Twitter.

2816
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I was on my personal Twitter.

2817
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And I saw a message that caught my eye that I'm just going to have to read it later because I'm trying to do a show.

2818
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Yeah, Rob, on your Twitter as I check my Facebook.

2819
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Let's go to some tweets while we wait for calls.

2820
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Again, Skype line is open.

2821
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2822
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:37,000
YYR says, ask Dark Tetsuya.

2823
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
That's the person right below.

2824
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,000
That's not me.

2825
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Ask Dark Sakura to give Fernando, the main character in Bungee Ferret Tossing or BFD, a last name.

2826
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
He's French Canadian.

2827
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
And then get back to me.

2828
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Well, shit, this could have been the list list tonight, but oops.

2829
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Fernando needs a last name.

2830
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
He is French Canadian.

2831
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Cocteau.

2832
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:07,000
I was going to say an amalgamation of Celine Dion.

2833
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
She's French Canadian.

2834
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Fernando Celine Dion?

2835
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Fernando C. Dion.

2836
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Alright, never mind.

2837
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
That's stupid.

2838
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Yeah, that is.

2839
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I was trying to think of a way to make it work like Cécile Dion.

2840
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
You think about that Dark Sakura while I take this call.

2841
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Poisson.

2842
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:29,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.

2843
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:30,000
No, I thought of it. Poisson.

2844
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I'm taking a call.

2845
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLounge Radio.

2846
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Who's this?

2847
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Hey, what's up?

2848
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:38,000
This is John, aka Wicked, from the Nerdgasm Network.

2849
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:42,000
What is up, John, aka Wicked, from the Nerdgasm Network?

2850
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:45,000
Indie podcast, holla.

2851
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
What's up, Robert?

2852
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
What's up?

2853
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:56,000
This is the first time I've actually been on the live stream, in the chat, listening to the show live, but I've been listening to the podcast for about a year now.

2854
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Awesome. Well, thank you for joining us live, and I'm happy we could pop your Skype cherry tonight.

2855
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Definitely. I meant to come in last week, but, you know, wow, don't you say anything.

2856
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:13,000
It was kind of a pain in the ass to get through last week, so it's a lot clearer tonight.

2857
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Definitely. I just wanted to say hi to everybody there, and just kind of slightly promote Nerdgasm Network a little bit, but I do have a little bit of discussion. It's not shameless self-promotion completely.

2858
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:31,000
All right. Okay, first discussion, then shameless self-promotion.

2859
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Gotcha. There were some talks with the Wii U earlier, and I mentioned this inside the chat, and I kind of want to get your guys' opinion on this.

2860
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Yeah.

2861
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:58,000
But it seems like Nintendo's not really kind of learning from their old mistakes, because the Wii kind of came out before the 360 and the PS3, I believe, and you can obviously tell by comparison that the Wii is not the strongest graphically of the three systems.

2862
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:14,000
And sadly, it seems like the Wii U is going to come out again, and while it's going to be superior to the 360 and the PS3 as far as graphics and check and everything, it's still going to vastly be inferior to, you know, whatever the Microsoft Sony platform is going to be.

2863
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I'm just wondering, do you think Nintendo should have even, like, brought this out now, or do you think they probably should have waited a year and tried to equalize it? I mean, do they understand that they're going to, you know, that they're essentially going to repeat the path?

2864
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Here's the thing, and, you know, in theory, what you're saying, it sounds good, and to me, as somebody who's been gaming for many, many years, it makes a lot of sense, and I always want the best technology and all that.

2865
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:53,000
However, there's one big flaw, and that is the Wii sold fuck tons. Far after the 360 and the PS3 came out, the Wii was still selling fuck tons, even though it wasn't the most powerful system.

2866
02:45:53,000 --> 02:46:15,000
And so I think Nintendo would be happy as shit to sell even three quarters of the amount of Wii U as they sold the Wii. However, I will say this, one thing, if they don't prepare well enough for the future, the theory that you do have here is right, in that the technology will lose steam and it will lose steam fast.

2867
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:27,000
That's the problem, is that the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3, they're continuing to sell in some ways Sony better than ever, but Nintendo, they fell down the shitter in the past year.

2868
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:36,000
But the only problem is that this new generation of systems, or at least this new Nintendo system, isn't that, it's not very different from the Wii.

2869
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:44,000
See, before, with the Wii, there wasn't a system out like that. It was completely new. These motion controls were completely unique to it, and it was a unique experience.

2870
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:54,000
The Wii U with an extra tablet controller, people are familiar with tablets. I don't think they're going to give a shit that it's slightly better graphics and it has a tablet controller on it.

2871
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:10,000
They're going to be like, why do I need this? I can buy a Wii. And honestly, they can. They can buy a Wii and New Super Mario Brothers and they have pretty much the same offering as New Super Mario Brothers U and a Wii U, except they don't have the extra tablet controller and the graphics aren't slightly prettier, I guess.

2872
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:22,000
I guess at the end of the day, it also comes down to how badly do soccer moms across America want a sequel to New Super Mario Brothers Wii, because it's about the most exciting original IP that Nintendo unveiled for that thing.

2873
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:30,000
And it's not even that original, but it's a successful formula. That's what this is all about.

2874
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And sadly, I think software might end up playing a big issue, especially, I mean, it's Nintendo, so obviously third-party software is going to be a big issue, especially because when they first originally announced the Wii U, one of the big titles they were toting was Batman Arkham City.

2875
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:48,000
And the thing is, that's already been out for about a year, and the Wii U still isn't even out yet.

2876
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:56,000
So are they still really going to be toting a two-year-old, essentially, when the release is probably a two-year-old game, as like a flagship bearer?

2877
02:47:56,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Sadly, if E3 is any indication, yes. But it's got a cool new mechanism.

2878
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:12,000
But I don't think that's necessarily a big game for them, because, I mean, yeah, it's cool that they have Batman Arkham City, but there's plenty of other games that are coming out around the same time, like Assassin's Creed 3, which will be pretty big.

2879
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:22,000
And then they've got a lot of exclusives for the system as well. But yeah, it's kind of stupid that they're going to have all these games that have been out for months or years before it comes out, like Ninja Gaiden 3.

2880
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Darksiders 2, to a lesser extent, because that's only coming out a few months before, but it's still something that's going to have been out for a while.

2881
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Not even Mass Effect is getting me that excited.

2882
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Yes, Mass Effect 3 is like, seriously, I mean, that's just, it seems like easy money.

2883
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Unless I can finally romance some of the characters I've been wanting to romance, like that.

2884
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Me too.

2885
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,000
That's just, it's my secret.

2886
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Mm-hmm!

2887
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,000
I can see him doing good.

2888
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:54,000
I can see him doing like a Game of the Year edition with Mass Effect, although that would be pretty quick.

2889
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
She is a bit of a cougar, isn't she?

2890
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Exactly. Alright, self-promotion time, so we can wrap up and get more calls, but self-promotion. We like to support indie podcasts, so please, plug away.

2891
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Alright, I've got three podcasts I want to plug. Obviously, my home at NergasmNetwork.com. We've got great discussions going on, we've got a video game podcast that I co-host with Ryan, Josh, Patrick, a few other people.

2892
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:36,000
They also have a new movie podcast, where it's kind of like a riff-track, where they watch a movie and they kind of discuss, like, they kind of poke fun at it, but they also kind of discuss, you know, the cinematography and all the other stuff.

2893
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
That's a great idea.

2894
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:48,000
That's a great, you know, and I've heard other people kind of talking about that sort of thing, like a, I don't want to call it a riff-tracks podcast, but that's kind of what heavily inspires it sort of thing, to play along with the movie.

2895
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:54,000
I'm glad somebody is doing it, and not just talking about it. It's great.

2896
02:49:54,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Yeah, we're just having issues with the YouTube channel, because that's where we're uploading the films plus the commentary, and we're getting some issues with that.

2897
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
But we're working on it.

2898
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:20,000
But, you know, there's nothing wrong with putting just the commentary out there and say, okay, press play in three, two, one, go, you know, and you can watch the movie along, especially if its title is available on Netflix. Tons of people have Netflix. It'd be super easy.

2899
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Yeah, I'd be fun to work on it.

2900
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Also, Nergasm Network is home to the bi-weekly beer chasm, where Ryan and some more select groups review beer.

2901
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Well, my gosh, you don't just have a podcast, you have a whole freaking network over there, but that sounds, that's awesome.

2902
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Yeah, there's also a couple other shows coming down the pipeline. We've got a music podcast, there's going to be a tech, kind of an overall tech podcast coming up as well.

2903
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:52,000
But yeah, nerdgasmnetwork.com, that's, like you said, indie podcast going away.

2904
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
That's right.

2905
02:50:54,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Yeah, and I've got one more site I kind of want to pimp out. I'm sure you know these guys. Slykick and Spike, the hosts of GameBooey.org.

2906
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:07,000
That's right. It's a newer show, but it's a lot of fun.

2907
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Yeah, I used to go to high school with Spike, so I'm really good friends with him. Slykick used to be a guest on my old podcast, Geeks or Fans, but that kind of closed up earlier this year.

2908
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Don't. But yeah, no, Spike and Slykick are two very, very good friends of mine, and I've been begging them to come up and be on OLR forever, so open invite, guys.

2909
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:38,000
You want to come pimp your show, get your butt up here to Sacramento. It's not China, it's not that far of a foreign land.

2910
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Yeah, we'll try getting them to even get to Stockton and try to get them to come out here for like 12 years now.

2911
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:48,000
All right, we'll both keep pestering them, and one of us will win eventually.

2912
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Definitely. In fact, I actually started listening to Orange Laundrio because of Hoard House because Slykick actually promoted a couple episodes he was on on Hoard House.

2913
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Indie podcast promotion, it works. It works.

2914
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Yeah, definitely. So, you know, there's two podcast sites that you guys should check out, GameBooey.org and, of course, NergasmNetwork.com.

2915
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:15,000
All right, if I let you plug anymore, I'm going to have to make you pay for it. All right, have a good one, buddy. I've got to take more calls. Thank you for your call.

2916
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:18,000
All right. No problem. And keep listening to OLR.

2917
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,000
All right, will do.

2918
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:22,000
By the way, I have decided on a last name thanks to Alan.

2919
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Oh, okay. Bye, take care.

2920
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Yes, you have a last name thanks to Alan.

2921
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Poutine.

2922
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Poutine. So the name will be Fernando Poutine.

2923
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Fernando Poutine.

2924
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
All right, there it is. That's the name. Fernando Poutine.

2925
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundrio. Who's this?

2926
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,000
It's Shane.

2927
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Hey, Shane, what's up?

2928
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:40,000
It's me. I'm awake.

2929
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Is there anything you wanted to call to share with us tonight?

2930
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Yes.

2931
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Garris.

2932
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:50,000
I want to talk about Mass Effect.

2933
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Yay, my favorite topic.

2934
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:56,000
It's mine too. What a coincidence.

2935
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Yeah, that's weird.

2936
02:52:57,000 --> 02:53:10,000
So I'll get it out of the way. First of all, I do like the extended cut stuff, despite a lot of people hating it. And I understand their complaints, but I like all the happy and sad parts of it. So it's cool.

2937
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:30,000
But I think either BioWare is really stupid and the fans are brilliant or BioWare is an evil genius because I'm finding even more people starting to subscribe to the indoctrination theory after the extended cut now.

2938
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:45,000
And there's all these new things that they put in the extended cut that point to it. And it's getting ridiculous. And I'm torn because I used to believe in it. I still kind of do. But at the same time, I don't want to keep going with it.

2939
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:52,000
If you want something to be true bad enough, you'll find a way to make it true in your mind. You know?

2940
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Yes, but there's videos and sound files.

2941
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Again, that's all part of they're just wishing really hard, wishing I want it to be true. Click my heels three times. There's no place like indoctrination theory. There's no place like something like that.

2942
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:10,000
I don't think they would ever really say that.

2943
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I did. Okay, well, so it hasn't just been about Mass Effect this week, though, but you also have been playing Final Fantasy 11 with me. And for a change, I started playing the game first and peer pressured you into buying it.

2944
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:25,000
So what did you think about the return to Final Fantasy 11?

2945
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:35,000
It was a nice like homecoming sort of feeling. And I like that everything's familiar, but at the same time, they've changed it enough that it's still interesting.

2946
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:45,000
So it's not just the same. Let's go to the dunes and level for four hours, but only get, you know, 50% of the way through a level because we died seven times.

2947
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Right.

2948
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:57,000
That's fantastic. Like, I want to keep playing it, but then there's Mass Effect multiplayer I have to play. And that's really the only two games I'm jumping between. Wow. I don't even turn that on for the most part now.

2949
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:07,000
Well, the good news is there's not a lot of other games coming out. So now's a good chance to kind of catch up on stuff like I, I still really need to play Skyrim, even though I've been hearing kind of tepid reception of the DLC.

2950
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:12,000
I never did beat the frickin campaign mode in the first game. I need to go back and do that.

2951
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:24,000
That's right. I started replaying that last night cause I got really bored and it was still okay, but I'm not going to download any DLC cause it's an Elder Scrolls game and they're generally awful. So I don't care.

2952
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
It's hit and miss. It's hit and miss. All right. Well, anything else you want to share with us tonight, Shane?

2953
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:32,000
No, cause I'm sure I'll just talk more about Mass Effect on the courthouse.

2954
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Well, like I was bugging you last night, just put the pen to paper and write out something to post on vognetwork.com.

2955
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Actually, Shane, I have to ask you a question.

2956
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I have an answer. What's up?

2957
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:46,000
What do you think of my idea for an MMO for Mass Effect?

2958
02:55:46,000 --> 02:56:04,000
I would drop all my games to play it, but I also don't know how it would work. Like, especially with the current universe the way it is. I don't know what we would really base the MMO off of.

2959
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:11,000
I see. I have to finish the third one before I can decide, but I'm sort of thinking, you know, post end game.

2960
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:14,000
And then you have to figure out which endings can end then.

2961
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Prequel, prequel, prequel, prequel. You just don't know it in the same storyline.

2962
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:27,000
Nobody wants a prequel because then if you do a prequel and if you set it too far back, then you'd be stuck on like earth, which would be boring.

2963
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Easy ass prequel because with the whole like Horde Alliance, you know, two faction type of thing, Turian War. You set the MMO during the Turian War.

2964
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
No, that's terrible.

2965
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I disagree.

2966
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Only because you wouldn't be able to romance a Turian.

2967
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Shut up.

2968
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Unless you were a Turian.

2969
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Because it's true.

2970
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:52,000
But it might be the first time we see female Turians, so that might make it worth it alone.

2971
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:57,000
They were apparently in the comic and they don't, they look like horrible, so no.

2972
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
That's not what female Turians look like in my head.

2973
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:03,000
All right. Before this turns into the Mass Effect show, I gotta let you go, Shane.

2974
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Shane, we should do that. A Mass Effect show.

2975
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Oh, he's already pitched one to me.

2976
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Yeah, I already have.

2977
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
And I say produce a pilot.

2978
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
All right. All right, take care.

2979
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Bye bye.

2980
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Bye.

2981
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:21,000
1877 game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call.

2982
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I did tweet YYR back. Hopefully he got it.

2983
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Because you're confusing the poor guy, because you sent him something else first, I think.

2984
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Poutine. Poutine.

2985
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:30,000
It is poutine.

2986
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
I stick with poutine.

2987
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
All right, the final answer.

2988
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Because that's a good idea, because it's kind of disgusting looking, but delicious.

2989
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Like a ferret?

2990
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Ferrets aren't delicious.

2991
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,000
I've never had ferret.

2992
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,000
All right, we have another call coming in. Let's take it.

2993
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2994
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
You're confused.

2995
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Sorry, this is Techie Q.

2996
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Say that again?

2997
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Sorry, this is Techie Q.

2998
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Techie Q?

2999
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Techie Q, sorry.

3000
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Techie Q, I got you. Techie Q, what's on your mind, buddy? Hi, welcome to the show.

3001
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Two things. One, congratulations on your 10 year since I didn't get to call in last week.

3002
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:14,000
The phone lines were absolutely bonkers last week, but we appreciate it.

3003
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:17,000
We like the fact that our birthday can last across multiple weeks.

3004
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:21,000
And also, I want to gloat on the classic game of the week.

3005
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:26,000
I'm one of the few people that beat Ninja Gaiden without cheating.

3006
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Well, look at you.

3007
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Hey, I know. Mad props, seriously.

3008
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:35,000
I do want to shake your hand. I'm giving you a virtual handshake right now.

3009
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
He really did. He held his hand up in front of the monitor.

3010
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:44,000
I did. I was looking for an emote icon that I could possibly send over, but that'll have to do.

3011
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:48,000
There he is. A thumbs up. I just sent him.

3012
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,000
But, I mean, seriously, it's really damn difficult to beat that game.

3013
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
It is. It is.

3014
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
So anyone who has, hey, you can do this for me.

3015
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:59,000
I mean, it's special like the last level. It's like an endurance run.

3016
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:03,000
And isn't it just the biggest exercise in frustration?

3017
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Uh, for the first hour it is.

3018
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:09,000
To get back to the three bosses you have to beat three times.

3019
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:16,000
I'll put it this way. Even beating Ghosts N' Goblins isn't nearly as frustrating as Ninja Gaiden.

3020
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Let me ask you this question, TechieQ.

3021
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:22,000
Do you like the new Ninja Gaiden games? Because clearly you're a fan of the old ones.

3022
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:25,000
But do you think they got it right with the newer ones?

3023
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:28,000
I don't like the third one. I really dumbed it down.

3024
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Nobody does. Let's be real.

3025
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Like the last Ninja Gaiden, the newer one I played was the second one.

3026
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:40,000
And that one red-ringed my 360. So I'm scared to play it.

3027
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Oh my gosh. You know what red-ringed my 360?

3028
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:45,000
What's that?

3029
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Joust.

3030
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Oh, wow.

3031
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:48,000
Right?

3032
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Yeah, that's crazy.

3033
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:50,000
That's sad.

3034
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Alright.

3035
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
Well, TechieQ, congratulations.

3036
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Did you beat the classic 8-bit sequels?

3037
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
What was it, the two ships and the other one?

3038
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Two, I didn't beat three. I just didn't even care anymore because it's so hard.

3039
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

3040
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:09,000
That one actually had lives and continues to mess with.

3041
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:12,000
If you have a working Super Nintendo somewhere, you should look for that compilation.

3042
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:15,000
It was really good. It had all three games on it.

3043
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Right.

3044
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:21,000
Alright, well, TechieQ, anything else you want to share with the listeners and such tonight?

3045
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
Chainsaw light pop is awesome.

3046
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Chainsaw light pop. I've been hearing some mixed things on it.

3047
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
But what makes it awesome? Why do you like it?

3048
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:36,000
I think it's the humor and the 80s satire that people miss out if you don't play enough of the game.

3049
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:40,000
You know, that's true. Humor can go a long way because I seriously loved Saints Row the Third.

3050
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:46,000
And let's be real, it's not that great of a game and it's nothing you haven't seen in stuff like Grand Theft Auto.

3051
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:49,000
But the humor is what makes it a lot of fun.

3052
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Yeah.

3053
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
That and the sing-along for what I've got.

3054
03:00:52,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I think you'd like it too, because it's got a lot of 80s satire and they did a Commodore 64 segment.

3055
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:06,000
I'm going to have to check that out. And boobies, right? Is there lots of boobies?

3056
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,000
You've got the right costume. You've got a grand fort.

3057
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
There you go. Alright.

3058
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Well, TechieQ, I've got to let you go, but Lollipop Chainsaw, I'll check it out and let you know what I think in a future week.

3059
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Okay, take care.

3060
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:17,000
Take care.

3061
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Alright, bye.

3062
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Alright, I'm going to have to close up the Skype line just because we're running a little long and I still got to get last minute stories and tweets.

3063
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
You know what I want?

3064
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,000
What?

3065
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:27,000
Poutine.

3066
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
I've had it before. It's really good.

3067
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:39,000
It is really good. It is really good. If you ask really, really nicely, maybe Allen will get you a little spoon and there's some strawberry pinkberry in the freezer.

3068
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Alright, don't give her too much because I want some later.

3069
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
One spoonful. No, I'm kidding.

3070
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:50,000
Alright, more tweets.

3071
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Ziba tweets us saying, have you guys seen Tron Uprising, the animated series yet?

3072
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:58,000
I have seen the first episode so far and it was really good.

3073
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,000
You and I have seen the same amount of Tron Uprising.

3074
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:10,000
I was going to write a further review for VOG, but then I realized that because the guy in the truck was a liar, I was behind in the episodes and I never got a chance to catch up.

3075
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
So I'm going to defer that review to later.

3076
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:18,000
But based on the first episode of Tron Uprising that I saw, yeah, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it.

3077
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
I was going to give it a positive review.

3078
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:27,000
It wasn't perfect. I felt the storyline was a little bit cliche and predictable, but it is a cartoon. Let's not be too harsh on it.

3079
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:31,000
And I liked the whole dark style of it.

3080
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:38,000
It was a very Batman animated series look because Batman was always a black canvas as opposed to a white canvas.

3081
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:41,000
And I'm pretty sure Tron has done very similarly.

3082
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:42,000
You really liked it too, right?

3083
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:45,000
Yeah, I watched the first three episodes.

3084
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:51,000
It was good. I've liked it so far. I still need to catch up on some of them that I missed.

3085
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Alright.

3086
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Dark Tetsuya says he's going to make good on President Kat Pong, so stay tuned.

3087
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:01,000
I don't know how he's doing it, but maybe there's like a Pong maker? I don't know. We'll see.

3088
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Alright, moving on. Tigerclaw sharing a couple news tweets with us. The Google Nexus 7 is going to be available at GameStop.

3089
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
That story's been making the rounds this week.

3090
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:19,000
It actually doesn't surprise me too much because GameStop has been openly like, trade us your iPhone, trade us your iPad.

3091
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:27,000
They want to get into that market and I think it's because they're trying, you know, as much as I am personally not a fan of GameStop,

3092
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:36,000
I can appreciate that they're trying to stay a step ahead and like, oh shit, if everything goes digital distribution, our market's going to be hardware.

3093
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:43,000
You know, we're going to be fucked soon. So they're trying to get their fingers in other pies so that they don't go completely out of business.

3094
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
So you know what? It makes sense.

3095
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Honestly, I think it's because they're trying to get more reasons for people to trade in their stuff and some people want to trade in games to buy tablets and stuff.

3096
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:55,000
And so that way they can sell more used games.

3097
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:56,000
Interesting.

3098
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:03,000
Because there's no markup in hardware. So, I mean, I'm not sure about consumer electronics, but I know for game hardware there's no markup.

3099
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:08,000
But what I said has to be some of it, right? I mean, that they're trying to get into other stuff than just games.

3100
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:12,000
They're not worried about it because of, you know, who they are.

3101
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Alright, one other tweet from Tigerclaw. This will be the last tweet and then we can go to last minute stories. I don't know even if you have any.

3102
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:24,000
But the shutdown law in South Korea. We reported on this either last week or the week before.

3103
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Some folks are challenging it. NCSoft being one of them, according to this news story from gamesindustry.biz that Tigerclaw sent me on Twitter.

3104
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:39,000
South Korea shutdown law has been called into question by citizens and game companies.

3105
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
Two lawsuits have been filed against the law.

3106
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:49,000
One is a Korean organization representing parents and children who says the law undermines parental rights to educate their children.

3107
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:57,000
We need that organization here.

3108
03:04:57,000 --> 03:05:05,000
The second lawsuit was filed by game publishers NCSoft, Neowiz, and Nexon.

3109
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:08,000
And they just argue the law itself is illegal.

3110
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:15,000
The lawsuits were filed last fall and the arguments are currently being heard, etc.

3111
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:18,000
So we'll get more news on that in the coming weeks.

3112
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:21,000
There you go. That's it for tweets. How about last minute stories tonight, Loki?

3113
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:30,000
The voice actor for Duke Nukem is bitching that some of the voice acting work in video games goes over to film actors.

3114
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:36,000
And he says film actors do not need voice acting roles in video games or commercial projects.

3115
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:40,000
These roles are for voice actors, not Hollywood celebrities.

3116
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:43,000
And when you consider the amount of money they make for each and every film project,

3117
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:49,000
it's unfair for those of us who have struggled to make ends meet in our chosen profession.

3118
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:52,000
I have trained and worked hard for nearly 30 years as a voice actor.

3119
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:58,000
And when film stars land a role in either game or commercial project, they earn far more than I do,

3120
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:04,000
even though I am a SAG-AFTRA union member.

3121
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:08,000
How is that fair? I don't appreciate them taking work from me and my fellow VAs.

3122
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Well, you know what? People aren't being drawn to games because your name's on it.

3123
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:15,000
And maybe they just audition better than you do.

3124
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:24,000
I really hate to say it, but I think this guy is just, I mean, the reality is, he needs to ask the question,

3125
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:29,000
well, why do celebrities get in Shrek? And why are they in the Disney movies?

3126
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:35,000
And why are they, you know, because unfortunately star power and the names behind it mean a lot.

3127
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:42,000
And as much, it sucks because this guy does have an iconic voice in many ways.

3128
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:46,000
The voice of Duke Nukem, right? Hail to the king, baby. And all that stuff, right?

3129
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:51,000
Nobody knows his name. Maybe that's what needs to change.

3130
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Maybe there needs to be more recognition about who you are and then you build that star power.

3131
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
I think that's the problem.

3132
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:08,000
It just made me think about something, though, back to Mass Effect, how you've got Martin Sheen as the elusive man.

3133
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:13,000
And modeled on him and everything, you've got all of these actors, you know, Seth Green in it.

3134
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:21,000
But the main characters, well, you have main characters there, but the main character is a well-noted voice actor.

3135
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Well, I'm actually thinking of the female Shepard, who's done like fantastic roles,

3136
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:31,000
and the Avengers cartoon was in X-Men and all kinds of stuff.

3137
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:37,000
And you've got the talents going, and that's where they're best directed.

3138
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:42,000
And I think that that's really the approach that should be taken, that everyone should be done by their merits.

3139
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:46,000
What are their skills as a voice actor? Martin Sheen sounds like Martin Sheen.

3140
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:49,000
He's not hiding that this is Martin Sheen playing a role.

3141
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:56,000
But I doubt he'd be able to go in and be a different voice than Martin Sheen, you know what I mean?

3142
03:07:56,000 --> 03:08:02,000
That's my point. So I kind of agree and kind of don't.

3143
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:06,000
Just saying, just saying.

3144
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:11,000
All right. Well, any other last-minute stories to share tonight?

3145
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:22,000
There's a new Kickstarter for a game that's, I guess, being built on the Rage Engine, and it's called Ravaged.

3146
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:26,000
I guess it's supposed to be like a multiplayer-type game.

3147
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:32,000
I guess Rage, you know, they were kind of promising this big multiplayer thing, and it never really happened.

3148
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:39,000
So now it's this, oh, it's being based on Unreal 3, and it's going to look like Rage, though.

3149
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:43,000
So Ravaged, multiplayer kind of Rage-type game.

3150
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:50,000
Post-apocalyptic, car racing, gun fighting. Looks neat.

3151
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Oh, and speaking of Kickstarter, that retro, was it the retro game 101?

3152
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Yeah, you mentioned that last week. Already hit it, right?

3153
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:01,000
Yeah, they already hit it. I was surprised.

3154
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Well, so Kickstarter is still working for some folks.

3155
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,000
Yeah.

3156
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:09,000
Some of us thought it would be a fad, but it's still going for some.

3157
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:15,000
Yeah, speaking of Kickstarter, episode 8 out of 9 for Video Game High School.

3158
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:19,000
So the last episode of this season is going to be on Thursday.

3159
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:24,000
Can't wait, because it's been kind of frustrating.

3160
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:28,000
And hopefully it's going to, well, better turn around for the last episode.

3161
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:31,000
But yeah, I've liked it so far, though.

3162
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Alright. Well, that is going to bring to close another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

3163
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:42,000
But before we say goodnight, of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and say goodnight.

3164
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:46,000
Alan, I want to thank you for joining us in the studio tonight.

3165
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:49,000
And your wit and humor is always appreciated on the show.

3166
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:50,000
Thank you.

3167
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Bring more of it next time. You're really funny.

3168
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:53,000
Yeah.

3169
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:54,000
I want the listeners to hear more of it.

3170
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
I've been making dinner for like the last 20 minutes.

3171
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
Oh, understandable.

3172
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:01,000
Do you have any final thoughts for the listeners tonight?

3173
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:05,000
Strawberry pinkberry in the freezer. It's awesome.

3174
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:08,000
And the apartment is really clean, and I have laundry to fold. That's it.

3175
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:11,000
And that was really all you. I was a lazy bitch today.

3176
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:16,000
And Alan was like, I'm going to clean. Although I did get the bed propped up and all that stuff.

3177
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:21,000
And we need more people on our Origin friends list for Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

3178
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Soon, soon.

3179
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:27,000
If you're in the oil army, message me or Sky.

3180
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:28,000
Do you have your name?

3181
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:31,000
I'm AlanAlchemy78 on Origin.

3182
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:32,000
Alright. There you go.

3183
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,000
So play with us.

3184
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:34,000
Play with me.

3185
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:37,000
Although my galaxy is already at 100%.

3186
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:39,000
Still, multiplayer is really fun.

3187
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Especially with friends.

3188
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:43,000
Anyhow, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3189
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:50,000
I don't even know how much money those guys must have thrown at this crappy game in order to get it finished in that amount of time.

3190
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:56,000
Because I'm on the first challenge right now, which is a fine 480's themed with lunchboxes.

3191
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:00,000
And I found one in like the last three hours.

3192
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:07,000
I don't even know how it's possible. They must have spent hundreds of dollars on this.

3193
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:10,000
And it's fucking boring.

3194
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:11,000
I hate this game.

3195
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
So much.

3196
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:16,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

3197
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:19,000
I have a little bit of brain freeze.

3198
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,000
And Garris.

3199
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:24,000
My final thought tonight is Happy Canada Day.

3200
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:27,000
First, I would like to learn how to speak.

3201
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Poutine!

3202
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:33,000
Second, Happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.

3203
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:36,000
I'm hoping to come visit your country again.

3204
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:39,000
I had an absolute blast time in my life last time I was there.

3205
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Which was six years ago.

3206
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
Which was far too long.

3207
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
And last time was Vancouver.

3208
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
And next time I'm thinking Toronto.

3209
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:47,000
Right Alan?

3210
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:48,000
Yes.

3211
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:49,000
So we'll see.

3212
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:53,000
So yes, Happy Canada Day to all you beautiful Canadians out there.

3213
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
And the not so beautiful ones too.

3214
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:59,000
Although I saw nothing but good looking people when I was in Vancouver.

3215
03:11:59,000 --> 03:12:05,000
I will also say Happy 4th of July to my fellow Americans this week.

3216
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:06,000
Be safe.

3217
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:09,000
Please do not set people's roofs on fire.

3218
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:12,000
If you're going to do fireworks, especially illegal ones.

3219
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Have your bucket of water ready.

3220
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
And just frickin' be safe with it.

3221
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:17,000
Don't blow your finger off.

3222
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:19,000
Don't be stupid.

3223
03:12:19,000 --> 03:12:22,000
The 4th of July is not to celebrate stupidity.

3224
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:25,000
What if G asked if you ever said what the secret was?

3225
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:26,000
What secret?

3226
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000
You said that you had a secret?

3227
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:29,000
That I went back to Final Fantasy XI.

3228
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:30,000
Oh, okay.

3229
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,000
Did you know that before tonight?

3230
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:33,000
Yeah, actually I did.

3231
03:12:33,000 --> 03:12:34,000
How did you know?

3232
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,000
Because I saw your thing pop up.

3233
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:37,000
Sky is playing.

3234
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:38,000
Oh.

3235
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000
I would have thought you would have said something if that was the case.

3236
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:41,000
Like, addict.

3237
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:42,000
Didn't care.

3238
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
Loki didn't know.

3239
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:45,000
Alright.

3240
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:46,000
Sorry.

3241
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:52,000
If someone does want to help me with this, all they have to do is they can play the app

3242
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:56,000
Ultimate Collector and then send me energy.

3243
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:57,000
Or money.

3244
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:01,000
I got a frown from Acidic Vampire because I'm only talking about PC Mass Effect.

3245
03:13:01,000 --> 03:13:03,000
And you will only plug the PC Mass Effect.

3246
03:13:03,000 --> 03:13:05,000
Of course, I still play on 360 too.

3247
03:13:05,000 --> 03:13:08,000
In fact, my unlocks on 360 are way better.

3248
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:09,000
And guess what I did?

3249
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:10,000
What?

3250
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:12,000
I brought back your game.

3251
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:13,000
Yay!

3252
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:14,000
You know what's sad?

3253
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:17,000
Even though I have one and two on PC now, I think I'm going to do the replays on Xbox

3254
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:20,000
to get the rest of the achievements because I'm sad.

3255
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:22,000
Whore.

3256
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,000
Alright, that's it.

3257
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:28,000
If you enjoyed Orange Lounge Radio, or even if you didn't, help spread the word.

3258
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:29,000
That's all we ask.

3259
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:31,000
You know, we don't put commercials in the show.

3260
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:35,000
All we ask, spread the word, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio, help grow

3261
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
our family.

3262
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:38,000
We had a new caller tonight.

3263
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:40,000
We had some new faces tonight in chat.

3264
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:44,000
I really want to thank all you guys for taking the time out to listen to Orange Lounge Radio

3265
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,000
and help grow.

3266
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:52,000
Ten more years started tonight and it'll continue next week on Alan's Birthday Show.

3267
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:53,000
Yay!

3268
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:56,000
Except, not really, but that's what we're going to call it anyway.

3269
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
Have a great night everybody.

3270
03:13:58,000 --> 03:13:59,000
See you next time.

3271
03:13:59,000 --> 03:14:01,000
See you next time.

3272
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
See you next week.
