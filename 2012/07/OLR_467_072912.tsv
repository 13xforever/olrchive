8000	12000	Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loku

20000	23000	Game developers speak up on Windows 8
23000	27000	And could used digital games soon be a reality in the US?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet
33000	37000	And welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
37000	40000	It is the show where every gamer has a voice
40000	45000	It is episode number 467 for this July 29th, 2012
45000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours
48000	51000	To talk about video games, gaming culture, you know, our community
51000	54000	And cool things, and off-topic things
54000	57000	With my co-hosts, say hello to the one and only
57000	59000	Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers
59000	60000	Hi
60000	61000	How are you? Welcome back
61000	62000	Hi
62000	63000	Hi
63000	66000	How was the wedding? You were in Vegas last week for a wedding, right?
66000	67000	It was very lovely
67000	68000	Yeah
68000	69000	And very Jewish
69000	71000	Congratulations to Dan and Tiara once again
71000	73000	Even though we said it about five times last week
73000	74000	Yes
74000	76000	There was an open bar
76000	77000	Was there?
77000	79000	Well, then you had a blast at the wedding
79000	85000	I had many, many amaretto sours and raspberry vodka with cranberry sauce
85000	87000	Cranberry juice
87000	89000	Cranberries, gross
89000	93000	And mudslides and other things that people just put in front of me
93000	95000	And said, here, drink this, and champagne
95000	97000	So you'll drink anything someone puts in front of you?
97000	98000	No
98000	99000	Oh
99000	104000	People that I know and trust to put liquor in front of me
104000	105000	Nice, nice
105000	107000	It was very good, it had a very good time
107000	110000	And it was good to see everybody
110000	113000	And get my nails did
113000	114000	So, yeah
114000	115000	Awesome
115000	118000	Alright, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki
118000	119000	Hi
119000	120000	How are you, Loki?
120000	122000	I'm doing good
122000	123000	Good times
123000	124000	I like your shirt, by the way
124000	127000	You're wearing a shirt that actually says, Loki Charms
127000	130000	Yes, it was the ripped apparel shirt from a couple days ago
130000	131000	I like it
131000	133000	Or actually about a week ago
133000	134000	Oh, yeah?
134000	135000	Yeah
135000	136000	Alright
136000	139000	We have a special guest joining us tonight here in studio
139000	143000	And some of you old school Orange Lounge Radio fans might remember her
143000	146000	Because she has been on the show before, but it's been a very long time
146000	148000	I am so happy to welcome back to the show
148000	150000	Marissa
150000	151000	Hello
151000	152000	How are you, Marissa?
152000	153000	I'm great, how are you?
153000	155000	I am fantastic
155000	157000	Thank you so much for coming back to Orange Lounge Radio
157000	158000	Great to be here
158000	160000	For those who don't remember
160000	162000	All you need to see are her boobies
162000	164000	They are very nice breasts
164000	166000	And I don't mean to sound like a pig or whatever
166000	169000	But, I mean, seriously, girl
169000	171000	They entered the room before me
171000	173000	Don't forget to talk right into that microphone
173000	175000	Because it's not very sensitive, unfortunately
175000	176000	So they can barely hear you
176000	178000	It's not nearly as sensitive as Rob
178000	180000	I mean, I have to do it because it's been years later
180000	182000	Why am I not, I'm not here
182000	183000	Is the mic on?
183000	184000	Testes one, two
184000	187000	I don't know, it's like very quiet for some reason
187000	189000	Why don't you just pick up Loki's mic?
189000	190000	Hello, hello?
190000	191000	Hello, is that better?
191000	193000	Much better, now I can actually hear you
193000	194000	Alright, how are you Marissa?
194000	195000	I'm great, thank you
195000	197000	Despite the technical failure
197000	200000	Why don't you tell the boys and girls listening at home
200000	203000	And in PlayStation Home, which I'll get to in a minute
203000	204000	I haven't forgotten you guys
204000	206000	Why don't you tell them about yourself real quick
206000	209000	Well, I'm a music geek
209000	212000	Singer-songwriter and, you know, collector of vinyl
212000	213000	And all sorts of music
213000	217000	And I also, as far with regard to gaming
217000	218000	I'm an adventure game geek
218000	220000	You know, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
220000	223000	And King's Quest and, you know, things as such
223000	226000	I'm not really that up to date with the modern stuff
226000	229000	But there have been some recent, you know, not that recent
229000	230000	But, you know, adventure games
230000	232000	You hear a little blip about them every now and again
232000	233000	They're having a nice little renaissance
233000	236000	Thanks to, kind of, a lot of the stuff that Telltale's been doing
236000	239000	And the indie community especially has been very big on this
239000	242000	Like, I know there was the King's Quest fan thing
242000	244000	The silver lining, which was really awesome
244000	247000	And, you know, the fan community's just great for that stuff
247000	248000	That was great
248000	252000	So, actually, I came up here specifically to see this band, Prilosis
252000	256000	And if any of the buddies in Sacramento, I highly recommend that you check them out
256000	257000	They're a metal band
257000	259000	They're also actually hilarious
259000	261000	They have a great YouTube channel
261000	265000	It's P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S
265000	268000	And that's also Prilosis.com
268000	270000	And for anybody that's into metal music, I just had to recommend them
270000	273000	Because that was a lot of fun and they're fantastic
273000	276000	But that's more music geekery for me
276000	279000	That's no problem because now the network is about everything geek
279000	280000	It's voice of geeks
280000	284000	So, a little music geekery on our show, it's A-OK
284000	286000	Especially for metal fans
286000	290000	You know, I'm not even actually a metal fan by nature
290000	291000	But I really enjoyed it
291000	292000	They're really melodic
292000	296000	And it's just amazing, though, how one can expand your horizons
296000	300000	Especially when it involves people that are really musically gifted
300000	302000	But you do a lot of music playing yourself, right?
302000	304000	I do a little bit of singer-songwriter stuff
304000	308000	Bitching about ex-boyfriends with an acoustic guitar and stuff like that
308000	310000	So you're like a Lilith Fair, basically
310000	312000	Not that bad, but
312000	314000	I'm doing a lot of jazz covers recently
314000	316000	I have a guitar player and it's been a lot of fun
316000	319000	Hanging out at this place called Kulak's Woodshed North Hollywood
319000	321000	And they webcast actually live all their shows
321000	322000	Nice
322000	324000	And it's kind of a singer-songwriter deal as well
324000	325000	Very cool
325000	326000	Well, welcome all the way from LA
326000	327000	Appreciate you stopping by tonight
327000	329000	So happy to see everyone
329000	331000	Speaking of live webcasting, I'm going to transition to this
331000	333000	This is going on tonight, a little special event
333000	336000	The VOG Network got asked to be a part of
336000	341000	PlayStation Home Summerfest is going on right now, live
341000	343000	And I know we have some new listeners tonight
343000	345000	Because of the PlayStation Home Summerfest
345000	347000	I will say this is an unofficial event
347000	349000	It's not something that Sony is really sponsoring
349000	351000	But I bet they're really happy it's going on
351000	353000	Because there's lots of people
353000	357000	It's fan-organized and lots of different communities
357000	361000	Be they gaming communities or PlayStation Home specific communities
361000	363000	And so forth are coming together
363000	366000	To basically put on a week-long event of
366000	370000	Hey, let's get a bunch of awesome people together
370000	373000	And, you know, dance, have contests
373000	375000	Talk to each other, kind of get a chance to meet new people
375000	379000	And I spent all of the last hour during Bobby Blackwolf's show
379000	383000	Because he's before us live at vognetwork.com on Sunday nights
383000	386000	5 Pacific, 8 Eastern, right before us
386000	391000	I was in PlayStation Home during his show
391000	394000	And just kind of really seeing the community
394000	397000	It was almost like watching an episode of Cheers
397000	399000	Where people would show up
399000	401000	Norm!
401000	403000	Everybody seemed to know each other
403000	405000	I thought it was really cool
405000	407000	In a way I felt like an outsider
407000	409000	But everybody was super welcoming
409000	411000	It was like saying hello when I was talking about VOG
411000	413000	And people were actually pretty receptive
413000	416000	During Bobby's show he got a caller from somebody
416000	418000	That had never listened to VOG before
418000	420000	But was listening because of PlayStation Home
420000	423000	And I just thought that was a great cross-promotional opportunity
423000	425000	So if you are listening live
425000	429000	And you are in PlayStation Home
429000	432000	I do want to point out Bobby Blackwolf is in there now
432000	435000	And he's going to be feeding me comments from PlayStation Home
435000	437000	To possibly read during the show
437000	439000	He just got there
439000	440000	So give him a big hello
440000	443000	And be sure to shout out hogwash for him
443000	444000	So he can see
444000	447000	That's become the rally cry of tonight in PlayStation Home
447000	451000	I noticed that during Bobby's show earlier
451000	454000	Of course if you want to do things the old fashioned way
454000	455000	Nothing wrong with that
455000	457000	I'm not going to ignore you guys
457000	459000	In our always present chat room
459000	461000	Live.vognetwork.com
461000	463000	Is where the traditional IRC based chat room is
463000	466000	If you want to join that and chat along with the show
466000	468000	You can also check in to the show at VOG Network
468000	470000	As we are live here and get your VOG points
470000	472000	And maybe a little bit of loot
472000	474000	Alright
474000	476000	Stan in our chat room
476000	478000	At live.vognetwork.com starts us off tonight saying
478000	481000	Rob is there a way to stream the live podcast
481000	482000	On PlayStation Home
482000	484000	Cause I'll switch if I can
484000	487000	You know sadly I don't think that's something that's possible yet
487000	489000	Because I don't think you can really do
489000	491000	Like streaming music or any of that yet
491000	494000	We should all let Sony know that's something we want in the future though
494000	497000	Cause how awesome would it be if in that VOG Network clubhouse
497000	499000	We could actually have like a VOG Network feed
499000	501000	That would be like the best thing ever
501000	503000	So who knows anything's possible in the future
503000	506000	So BlackWolf is reporting that
506000	508000	From PlayStation Home
508000	511000	That the club channels just died again
511000	514000	Our party is crashing the servers y'all
514000	516000	Do we know how to party or what?
518000	519000	Alright
519000	522000	Anyhow so yes again a big hello to you guys
522000	524000	At PlayStation Home who are listening tonight
524000	526000	Let me throw out some names I remember from before
526000	528000	Manda Panda
528000	529000	Jay
529000	530000	Steven
530000	533000	Junebug
533000	536000	That guy who had the 91 on the back of his shirt
536000	538000	That made me feel insignificant no just kidding
538000	540000	But yeah I want to say hi to all you guys who are
540000	543000	Listening right now
543000	544000	Alright
544000	546000	And also some of the
546000	548000	OL Army and VOG regulars
548000	550000	Are in Home Summerfest right now
550000	552000	I saw Tigerclaw in there earlier and I saw
552000	554000	Spaznators and some of the other people
554000	556000	So that's pretty cool there's kind of the cross
556000	558000	Promotion stuff going on so that's what it's all about
558000	560000	It's just promoting community and
560000	562000	And cool people meeting other cool people
562000	564000	I know PlayStation Home
564000	566000	Has had it's share of you know
566000	568000	Some people still don't get it
568000	570000	And I even admit I've sometimes
570000	572000	Been a little critical of Home on the show
572000	574000	But that has nothing to do with the community
574000	576000	That's only about the software
576000	578000	That sometimes it can be a little slow
578000	580000	And tough to connect to things but
580000	582000	It really has changed a lot
582000	584000	Since that first beta
584000	586000	So if you haven't checked out PlayStation Home in the past three years
586000	588000	Seriously there's like a million mini
588000	590000	Games now tons of prizes you can
590000	592000	Get for your avatar and just like cool little
592000	594000	Knick knacks it really is worth checking
594000	596000	Out if for nothing else than just to
596000	598000	Meet some of the awesome people that are on
598000	600000	The PlayStation Home community
600000	602000	Alright
602000	604000	Before we get started with
604000	606000	Tonight's show I wanted to do a quick
606000	608000	Kickoff topic which I think might have
608000	610000	Been just saying hello to Marissa and
610000	612000	Interviewing her a little bit
612000	614000	Let's see Marissa
614000	616000	So you like adventure games
616000	618000	What is your favorite video game
618000	620000	Ever?
620000	622000	It really does have to be Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis
622000	624000	I really just love that game
624000	626000	Do you have a thing for Harrison Ford? Let's be real
626000	628000	No but I have a thing for fedoras
628000	630000	I really do
630000	632000	Damn I left mine out in the car
632000	634000	No true story
634000	636000	One of my other passions besides internet radio and video games
636000	638000	I have been a member of like live shadow casting
638000	640000	For midnight movies like Rocky Horror Picture
640000	642000	Show especially right for like
642000	644000	12 years well lately
644000	646000	I've started doing stuff with Repo the genetic
646000	648000	Opera which is you know one of this
648000	650000	Yeah that's kind of I hate
650000	652000	Calling it the new Rocky Horror because it's not
652000	654000	It's just a new
654000	656000	Cool phenomenon that also happens to be
656000	658000	At midnight
658000	660000	Exactly it's kind of like the shadow casting
660000	662000	Thing of the now and last night
662000	664000	They did the 80's repo show
664000	666000	And I got to do Indiana Jones in a
666000	668000	Special cameo which was awesome
668000	670000	Did you bring your whip?
670000	672000	They did a joke
672000	674000	Where the Paris Hilton
674000	676000	Character Amber Sweet is kind of like a dominatrix
676000	678000	So they did a joke where I came out
678000	680000	As Indiana Jones
680000	682000	And she stole my whip
682000	684000	That was kind of the joke which was super cute
684000	686000	But the audience cheered
686000	688000	And I felt hot
688000	690000	Awesome
690000	692000	It was a good time anyhow
692000	694000	Let's get to video games
694000	696000	Speaking of games I know where to start
696000	698000	This week Loki I want to talk to you for a minute
698000	700000	Alright so you've been talking
700000	702000	For weeks about this
702000	704000	Contest this competition you
704000	706000	Were going to be at this weekend
706000	708000	Let's hear about it how did it go?
708000	710000	It was terrible
710000	712000	Ok what was this that you went to?
712000	714000	Ok so I went to a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
714000	716000	Contest it was going to be 2 on 2
716000	718000	And you know for a while I was trying
718000	720000	To find someone to go with and I had my
720000	722000	One of my friends brothers was going to go
722000	724000	With me and so everything sounded
724000	726000	Cool because he plays a lot of you know
726000	728000	Call of Duty I play
728000	730000	Quite a bit and you know
730000	732000	The rules were a little weird
732000	734000	It was basically custom classes
734000	736000	But there were certain restrictions on what kind
736000	738000	Of loadout you can have and that was fine
738000	740000	I practiced with you know the loadout
740000	742000	That I could
742000	744000	Work with in the
744000	746000	Rules of the
746000	748000	Tournament and so I was kind of ready
748000	750000	I had everything set up
750000	752000	Ok so here comes Friday
752000	754000	You know the Friday before
754000	756000	The tournament
756000	758000	Literally about 2 o'clock
758000	760000	My co-op
760000	762000	Partner drops out
762000	764000	So I have no one to go with
764000	766000	So I'm like fantastic ok
766000	768000	So I you know I
768000	770000	Call my friend Sean I'm like hey
770000	772000	Does your other brother play
772000	774000	Because you know and he's like yeah he plays
774000	776000	Let me see if he can go
776000	778000	No he's got things he's
778000	780000	Doing ok fine
780000	782000	Alright that's fine you know
782000	784000	I'll just find someone to play
784000	786000	With when I go down there or
786000	788000	I will just you know
788000	790000	I'll play one against two
790000	792000	That should be ok with you know I'll take them both on
792000	794000	Exactly with the loadout I had
794000	796000	So I drive these guys are gonna all be what
796000	798000	16 I'll take them all
798000	800000	So I drove down there
800000	802000	Like an hour and a half down to
802000	804000	Stockton and
804000	806000	So I'm
806000	808000	At the shopping center where this place is
808000	810000	And I can't find it at first so I
810000	812000	Look up on Facebook because
812000	814000	This plaza is actually
814000	816000	On both sides of the street I'm like oh that's probably
816000	818000	On the other side of the street let me just look up where it's at
818000	820000	So when I go to look it up
820000	822000	I notice that there's an update in the events
822000	824000	Oh by the way
824000	826000	We changed all the rules
826000	828000	Oh how convenient thank you
828000	830000	How convenient so they're all oh by the way
830000	832000	Now we're not doing custom classes we're just doing
832000	834000	The standard classes that are there
834000	836000	And with no restrictions I'm like
836000	838000	You gotta be fucking
838000	840000	Kidding me I drove all I'm like fine
840000	842000	You know what I drove all this way
842000	844000	I'm gonna play at least
844000	846000	So I get there sign up and everything oh by the way
846000	848000	Now we're gonna not do kill streaks
848000	850000	So it's like what the fuck
850000	852000	So ok so fine whatever I'll play
852000	854000	So I got hooked up with somebody else
854000	856000	And then it was just kind of it just kept going
856000	858000	Downhill from there oh yeah
858000	860000	We don't have headphones for
860000	862000	Anybody so you can't really hear what's going on in the game
862000	864000	Oh um
864000	866000	The person that we
866000	868000	Put you with he doesn't even
868000	870000	Really understand what kind of tournament it is
870000	872000	And he thinks it's a free for all tournament
872000	874000	First and then finally figures out
874000	876000	It's a co-op tournament so at this point
876000	878000	I'm like there's no fucking way we're gonna even win
878000	880000	One round and that's exactly what happened we played
880000	882000	First and we lost both of our rounds immediately
882000	884000	Because it was just a clusterfuck
884000	886000	I guess I had been practicing
886000	888000	With a certain class all week long
888000	890000	Per expectations to the tournament
890000	892000	And then they fucking switched it all up on me
892000	894000	So I'm like god damn it I don't know what fucking class I'm gonna play
894000	896000	And did they ask you, you mad bra?
896000	898000	Oh no oh it gets better than that
898000	900000	It gets better I'm like ok so what the hell
900000	902000	I mean why did you guys change the instructions
902000	904000	Oh well it's actually supposed to be standard classes
904000	906000	All along but that's what we've been telling everybody
906000	908000	That's been coming in here you know the past few weeks
908000	910000	Oh the past few weeks so you've known
910000	912000	About this shit and you've been telling everybody
912000	914000	Oh but you fucking failed to update it
914000	916000	On Facebook so that you know people that were
916000	918000	Coming out of town would know anything about it
918000	920000	Well I don't know I'm just
920000	922000	I'm just working here
922000	924000	It was a big fucking mess
924000	926000	So yes I didn't enjoy
926000	928000	Myself but at least you know what at least I didn't
928000	930000	Spend that much time in Stockton
930000	932000	I played for a few minutes
932000	934000	I got to meet with my customer and devs
934000	936000	Down there and I left and that was it
936000	938000	Dungeonbuster in our chat room at
938000	940000	Live.vognetwork.com says the rage
940000	942000	Gauge is nearing critical
942000	944000	DJ Morpheus is counting the number of F bombs
944000	946000	That you're dropping I do want to
946000	948000	Because we do have an influx of new listeners
948000	950000	Tonight thanks in part in
950000	952000	Large part to the Playstation Home Summerfest
952000	954000	I just want to remind everybody it is a mature
954000	956000	Audiences show so please put the kids to
956000	958000	Bed or put headphones on
958000	960000	Let's be honest I mean come on I mean there's
960000	962000	People that I've been to video game tournaments
962000	964000	Before you don't go to a tournament
964000	966000	That changes the fucking rules
966000	968000	Nah that's messed up like 10 minutes before the
968000	970000	Tournament starts like back in the day if it was like a
970000	972000	DDR tournament like oh man
972000	974000	That tournament would have been smeared on DDR
974000	976000	The next day yeah it's just it's
976000	978000	The next day the same day
978000	980000	The same day it was ridiculous
980000	982000	We couldn't we didn't have live blogging back
982000	984000	In that day but we had laptops at
984000	986000	Tournaments there was but see no one else was
986000	988000	Pissed there except for me because everybody else
988000	990000	Everybody else there was local and so they
990000	992000	Had been in the shop at least a couple times
992000	994000	Before you know tournaments started so they
994000	996000	Were aware of the the change in the rules
996000	998000	But no one fucking mentioned it
998000	1000000	At all it was just
1000000	1002000	It was really annoying but whatever you know what
1002000	1004000	I I even like
1004000	1006000	I contemplate I'm like do I really want to drive down
1006000	1008000	Stockton since it's just going to be myself you know
1008000	1010000	I do want to point out Wicked is in our
1010000	1012000	Chat room right now saying yay Loki
1012000	1014000	Was in my neck of the woods
1014000	1016000	So you are bashing one of our listeners
1016000	1018000	Hometowns right now but let's be real
1018000	1020000	Dude bro you live in Stockton
1020000	1022000	You know what though
1022000	1024000	Your city's bankrupt
1024000	1026000	Let me put it this way it at least
1026000	1028000	The tournament was in a
1028000	1030000	Seemed like a good portion of Stockton like the
1030000	1032000	The shopping mall was actually pretty
1032000	1034000	Nice I mean so
1034000	1036000	A compliment from Loki everybody
1036000	1038000	The mall was nice
1038000	1040000	Was it by the S Mart?
1040000	1042000	I don't know where the S Mart is but
1042000	1044000	But there you know in the game
1044000	1046000	Store was nice it's just I'm unfortunately
1046000	1048000	You have an idiot running your goddamn tournaments
1048000	1050000	That's the only problem and I don't know
1050000	1052000	It may very well be that this guy
1052000	1054000	Is new to running tournaments because I hear
1054000	1056000	That their fighting game tournaments run okay
1056000	1058000	But then again I'm sure they're not switching up
1058000	1060000	Rules you know it'd be funny
1060000	1062000	Hey let's go play
1062000	1064000	Marvel vs Capcom 3 tournament
1064000	1066000	Oh and the reason too
1066000	1068000	The reason that they changed up all the rules is because
1068000	1070000	Oh well we didn't want someone to say
1070000	1072000	Oh well the only reason you won is because you got this kill streak
1072000	1074000	And the helicopter killed me
1074000	1076000	Too fucking bad you can get the kill streak too
1076000	1078000	Damn it that's what I was planning
1078000	1080000	Exactly too fucking bad if you get killed by something
1080000	1082000	Or a certain gun or something
1082000	1084000	That classes have
1084000	1086000	You have all of these guns available to you
1086000	1088000	And you're playing by the same rules
1088000	1090000	Why can't you fucking just suck it up
1090000	1092000	That you just sucked instead of
1092000	1094000	Forcing these people
1094000	1096000	Which I say to just succumb to their peer pressure
1096000	1098000	To change the rules at the very last second
1098000	1100000	Because
1100000	1102000	Oh we don't want to hear someone bitching wine
1102000	1104000	Well you know what you're fucking hearing me bitching wine about it now
1104000	1106000	Because I had to drive 90 fucking minutes
1106000	1108000	To your stupid tournament
1108000	1110000	Which I will
1110000	1112000	Oh and by the way
1112000	1114000	I love my customer but
1114000	1116000	I'm like so are you coming back for Stockton Fest
1116000	1118000	I'm like no I'm not fucking coming back to Stockton Fest
1118000	1120000	I am not driving to Stockton ever again
1122000	1124000	When I drive to LA
1124000	1126000	I will drive around Stockton
1126000	1128000	The last time I went to Stockton someone stole my Xbox
1128000	1130000	This time I went to Stockton
1130000	1132000	Fucking tournament sucked
1132000	1134000	I'm not coming back to Stockton
1134000	1136000	There will not be a three strike law here
1136000	1138000	This is two strikes we're done
1138000	1140000	I'm not going back to Stockton
1140000	1142000	Wicked in our chat says
1142000	1144000	Trust me if I didn't have to live here
1144000	1146000	I wouldn't
1146000	1148000	Hey trust me
1148000	1150000	I'm sure it's just
1150000	1152000	It has nothing to do with Stockton
1152000	1154000	This could have been run in Sacramento and had an idiot running tournament
1154000	1156000	It doesn't matter
1156000	1158000	You don't fucking change the rules
1158000	1160000	At the last second
1160000	1162000	Okay if you're going to change the rules
1162000	1164000	I can understand if it was like
1164000	1166000	Hey you know what you guys
1166000	1168000	We said all these restrictions
1168000	1170000	Are in place
1170000	1172000	But we're just going to lift the restrictions now
1172000	1174000	Okay that's not so bad
1174000	1176000	Because I can still play with the class I had
1176000	1178000	Or I can change it up a little bit
1178000	1180000	Instead of oh by the way now you have to stick to one of these
1180000	1182000	Six classes
1182000	1184000	Oh and you know that sucked
1184000	1186000	And you can at least get some killstreaks and stuff
1186000	1188000	But we're going to take those away too
1188000	1190000	Wicked in our chat room says
1190000	1192000	Aw you won't come back to Stockton
1192000	1194000	Not even if I bake cookies
1194000	1196000	No
1196000	1198000	Sorry
1198000	1200000	I'm going to vomit all over the entire town
1200000	1202000	We're going to have to broker like a Loki Stockton
1202000	1204000	Peace Summit in like Lodi or something
1204000	1206000	I don't know
1206000	1208000	We're going to have to figure that one out
1208000	1210000	Alright look we're too many local jokes
1210000	1212000	It's a worldwide show
1212000	1214000	The rule I mean just
1214000	1216000	The lesson to be learned here is
1216000	1218000	You got to be I guess you have to be aware of how the
1218000	1220000	Wherever local stores
1220000	1222000	Are running a tournament
1222000	1224000	How they handle things
1224000	1226000	Because I mean honestly no one should be changing the rules
1226000	1228000	And I noticed they deleted the event
1228000	1230000	On Facebook so no one can comment
1230000	1232000	On it or anything
1232000	1234000	They must have had a few
1234000	1236000	Angry people
1236000	1238000	Who won?
1238000	1240000	I don't care I wasn't going to stick around
1240000	1242000	Who cares like I felt bad for the guy
1242000	1244000	That was playing with me I'm like well
1244000	1246000	Like is it like the second game
1246000	1248000	Basically it was
1248000	1250000	Oh and that was the other thing they changed too because it was single
1250000	1252000	Elimination first and then it was like oh best two out of three now
1252000	1254000	I'm like is it best two out of three or single
1254000	1256000	Elimination well it's best two out of three then
1256000	1258000	If you lose once then you're out
1258000	1260000	Okay fine
1260000	1262000	That doesn't even make sense
1262000	1264000	Whoever loses the best two out of three
1264000	1266000	And then or wins the best two out of three moves on
1266000	1268000	Then the loser is done
1268000	1270000	So
1270000	1272000	They so we did this
1272000	1274000	So we lost our first round because it was like okay
1274000	1276000	Let's try to get ahead and we were doing alright
1276000	1278000	I mean it wasn't like we lost by a whole
1278000	1280000	Ton
1280000	1282000	It's still you know quite a few
1282000	1284000	Points but it wasn't like you know
1284000	1286000	We had 100 points and they had
1286000	1288000	2500 or something it was pretty decent
1288000	1290000	But
1290000	1292000	You know we had already lost our first game so that put us at a disadvantage
1292000	1294000	For the second round because the second round it's like well
1294000	1296000	We have to come to them because they're not
1296000	1298000	You know in order to
1298000	1300000	Win this and so it just unfortunately
1300000	1302000	We had the advantage there
1302000	1304000	Alright we have a comment coming out of Playstation Home
1304000	1306000	The man Bobby Black Wolf is in he does
1306000	1308000	The show before us Sunday nights
1308000	1310000	On VOG Network he is in Playstation Home
1310000	1312000	Right now feeding me comments because I can't
1312000	1314000	I can't see the TV it's too far away
1314000	1316000	I'm in there doing the running man I can see everybody
1316000	1318000	In the circle doing the running man which was
1318000	1320000	Cracking Marissa up when she walked through the door
1320000	1322000	But I can't actually read
1322000	1324000	The chat because it's too far away
1324000	1326000	But Black Wolf says the spasinator
1326000	1328000	In Home says if Loki vomited
1328000	1330000	All over Stockton he'd probably
1330000	1332000	Improve the place
1332000	1334000	A circle of running men just sounds
1334000	1336000	Dirty too
1336000	1338000	Alright
1338000	1340000	Let's talk about our gaming
1340000	1342000	Weeks and the other actual games
1342000	1344000	We've been playing this week hopefully not at
1344000	1346000	Tournaments in Stockton that caused us to rage
1346000	1348000	Dark Soccer we'll start with you tonight
1348000	1350000	How was your gaming week?
1350000	1352000	It was Mass Effect-y
1352000	1354000	That was really about it
1354000	1356000	Because that's really about all I played that and
1356000	1358000	Some words with friends
1358000	1360000	Ewww Zynga game
1360000	1362000	Whatever Judging you
1362000	1364000	Whatever No I know it's popular
1364000	1366000	It's real popular I don't care if it's popular
1366000	1368000	It's addicting I've been playing a really
1368000	1370000	Addicted game I mean I'm like cutting and talking
1370000	1372000	About something in my week real quick but I've been
1372000	1374000	Playing well no this is important
1374000	1376000	I've been playing when don't I ever
1376000	1378000	Make a topic about me Dark Soccer
1378000	1380000	Even over what 10 years alright
1380000	1382000	More than that
1382000	1384000	There's a game on iPhone called
1384000	1386000	Song Pop I think is the name of it right
1386000	1388000	Now and it's really fun it's like guess the song
1388000	1390000	As fast as you can like it's like
1390000	1392000	Name that tune yeah yeah right
1392000	1394000	So you gotta check this out but here's
1394000	1396000	The problem we're all just looking at our
1396000	1398000	Watches counting down how long before
1398000	1400000	Zynga buys them
1400000	1402000	How long before Zynga buys them
1402000	1404000	Well Zynga's already getting burned because I think they're
1404000	1406000	Starting to realize that's ooh
1406000	1408000	I heard there's like all this I don't think it's
1408000	1410000	In our show tonight there's like all this scandal
1410000	1412000	Like the guy sold his stock like the CEO
1412000	1414000	Sold like a bunch of his stock like two months
1414000	1416000	Ago and then they had the report
1416000	1418000	Like you know insider trading
1418000	1420000	Investigation since you interrupted I'm gonna
1420000	1422000	Interrupt you as well that's cool since we're talking
1422000	1424000	About Facebook games and stuff
1424000	1426000	Let's talk about Facebook real quick
1426000	1428000	Facebook in case anyone
1428000	1430000	Hasn't fucking noticed
1430000	1432000	Is a little broken right now
1432000	1434000	Because you cannot
1434000	1436000	Unsubscribe from people's comments and likes
1436000	1438000	Or updates by games
1438000	1440000	I try I don't fucking care about
1440000	1442000	Your stupid song game or whatever
1442000	1444000	I'm trying to hide that shit but Facebook
1444000	1446000	Does not want to let you know what's funny I thought
1446000	1448000	I set all that shit to private
1448000	1450000	Like are you seeing my song song other people
1450000	1452000	Oh okay Bobby
1454000	1456000	It's alright and you know I don't mind
1456000	1458000	That kind of stuff it's mainly people
1458000	1460000	Commenting on other people's like cat photos
1460000	1462000	I really don't care if you think that's a cute cat
1462000	1464000	Or not but it's it's up
1464000	1466000	It's Facebook's problem because all that stuff
1466000	1468000	Was hidden before and now it's not
1468000	1470000	I just want to make it known that this is an
1470000	1472000	Issue so everybody can also make it
1472000	1474000	Known to their friends that this is an issue because
1474000	1476000	It no one seems to be fixing it
1476000	1478000	It's been like this for a week I think the real
1478000	1480000	Issue is that I heard this one into
1480000	1482000	Place a couple weeks ago like if in group
1482000	1484000	Let's say you're in a group and you make
1484000	1486000	A post in that group now
1486000	1488000	You can see when everybody
1488000	1490000	Read that post uh-huh
1490000	1492000	I kind of think that's like a privacy violation
1492000	1494000	In messages surprise
1494000	1496000	I want to be able to stalk people with
1496000	1498000	Impunity
1498000	1500000	Exactly I can see that too with
1500000	1502000	Messages direct messages that you send to people
1502000	1504000	On Facebook you can see if they've read it or not
1504000	1506000	Whatever happened
1506000	1508000	To good old fashioned anonymous ignoring you
1514000	1516000	It's just like those emails with read
1516000	1518000	Receipts and stuff like that I love deleting
1518000	1520000	Those before they get sent
1520000	1522000	It's terrible well actually
1522000	1524000	I mean I have to
1524000	1526000	Bitch about Facebook too because they're totally
1526000	1528000	Fucking over page owners right now
1528000	1530000	I mean I would I understand
1530000	1532000	That you know that they're a for profit entity
1532000	1534000	And they have to make money but I operate I operate
1534000	1536000	Several pages myself for musicians
1536000	1538000	And one for a venue that I work for
1538000	1540000	And you know it's very important for our
1540000	1542000	That mic is cutting in and out sorry about that
1542000	1544000	Live radio kids hello love ya
1544000	1546000	Okay burning with fire
1546000	1548000	I know um
1548000	1550000	Yeah I operate several pages for musicians
1550000	1552000	And for venues and for a venue that I work for
1552000	1554000	And um I completely
1554000	1556000	Understand that Facebook is a for profit
1556000	1558000	Entity and they need to make money
1558000	1560000	So I'd be happy to pay for extra features
1560000	1562000	However to pay for just
1562000	1564000	Basic exposure that would normally if you were
1564000	1566000	On a friends page would just go out to all of
1566000	1568000	Your friends is bullshit I'm sorry
1568000	1570000	On Facebook you pay with your
1570000	1572000	Soul this is true
1572000	1574000	I'm not gonna how do you like your Farmville
1574000	1576000	Now
1576000	1578000	I completely agree
1578000	1580000	But yeah I mean page owners if you didn't know that already
1580000	1582000	Your um your posts
1582000	1584000	Aren't getting Zuckerberg is watching you
1584000	1586000	Masturbate Shalom
1586000	1588000	I'm allowed
1588000	1590000	To say that
1590000	1592000	For the record
1592000	1594000	But yeah
1594000	1596000	I mean if you
1596000	1598000	For any page owners that didn't know this earlier
1598000	1600000	Unless you're you know paying for their extra services
1600000	1602000	You make a post to um on your page
1602000	1604000	It's not going to reach your whole audience
1604000	1606000	At all Marissa we really just need
1606000	1608000	To show on vog where we giggle for an hour
1608000	1610000	This is true
1610000	1612000	Giggle time
1614000	1616000	Oh dear what have I started
1616000	1618000	Tickle fest
1618000	1620000	Yay
1620000	1622000	Alright
1622000	1624000	Oh yeah this was Dark Soccer's gaming week at one point
1624000	1626000	Well fuck all that I'm looking up
1626000	1628000	Mass Effect t-shirts
1628000	1630000	I was not familiar with Mass Effect
1630000	1632000	And Jamie did introduce me to that character
1632000	1634000	Glorious Baritone he is lovely
1634000	1636000	Oh he's a lovely voice
1636000	1638000	The guy that was his voice actor was on
1638000	1640000	An episode of Buffy as like this real douchebag
1640000	1642000	Who was like this horrible character
1642000	1644000	Oh really? Yeah it was in season 7
1644000	1646000	So it doesn't count
1646000	1648000	Can you celebrate your heart?
1648000	1650000	He has a very nice lower register that's all I can say
1650000	1652000	Well then Marissa I'll ask you about your gaming week
1652000	1654000	It sounds like you got exposed to Mass Effect
1654000	1656000	A little bit
1656000	1658000	My new wallpaper by the way is the
1658000	1660000	Citadel smooch
1660000	1662000	That's it? Watching other people
1662000	1664000	Play Modern Warfare and then getting
1664000	1666000	Yelled at for stealing their bandwidth
1666000	1668000	Has pretty much been the rest of my gaming week
1668000	1670000	God dammit are you on the internet
1670000	1672000	Sorry
1672000	1674000	That's like Sunday nights at OLR
1674000	1676000	When Alan mistakenly
1676000	1678000	Downloads BitTorrents God dammit are you getting porn?
1678000	1680000	Trying to do a show
1680000	1682000	I'm trying to
1682000	1684000	Hack into our neighbor's connection
1684000	1686000	His connection's name is Mr. Touchy's
1686000	1688000	Uncle Touchy's puzzle basement
1688000	1690000	But I haven't been able to figure out his code yet
1690000	1692000	It's a Patton Oswalt joke
1692000	1694000	As long as it's
1694000	1696000	You won't wear a shirt and you'll cry
1696000	1698000	You can hack it pretty easy
1698000	1700000	I can send you the link
1700000	1702000	Lifehacker had an article on it
1702000	1704000	Alright
1704000	1706000	We'll go move on to Loki
1706000	1708000	Loki how was your gaming week besides Stockton?
1708000	1710000	Hey Stockton just was unfortunate
1710000	1712000	But this week
1712000	1714000	I didn't even finish mine
1714000	1716000	I thought you were done
1716000	1718000	Fuck you fuck everybody
1718000	1720000	I'm bi
1720000	1722000	Alright you're done
1722000	1724000	Okay so um
1724000	1726000	No no no no no hold on
1726000	1728000	I had to walk away so I wouldn't time out of home
1728000	1730000	You said and I quote
1730000	1732000	I've just been playing Mass Effect
1732000	1734000	I might have played other things
1734000	1736000	But when you say
1736000	1738000	I just played Mass Effect
1738000	1740000	Well I did just play Mass Effect before we left the house
1740000	1742000	That is true
1742000	1744000	She made it sound like
1744000	1746000	Oh forget it I'm not having a grammar war
1746000	1748000	With this woman
1748000	1750000	Fine lady how was the rest of your gaming week?
1750000	1752000	Uneventful
1752000	1754000	She is a level
1754000	1756000	She is a level 50 grammar knight by the way
1756000	1758000	She's a level 50 bitch right now
1758000	1760000	No Rob 69
1760000	1762000	I'm sorry bitch it's a subclass
1762000	1764000	You need to put a B in a circle on the back of your shirt
1764000	1766000	When you go into Playstation home
1766000	1768000	Alright Loki how was your gaming week?
1768000	1770000	Now do I have permission to move on to the show?
1770000	1772000	Carry on carry on
1772000	1774000	Thank you
1774000	1776000	How are you enjoying hosting the Olympics your queen?
1776000	1780000	All these countries used to be mine
1780000	1782000	No I have to do
1782000	1784000	I have to do the proper
1784000	1786000	All of these countries used to be mine
1786000	1788000	We are not amused
1792000	1794000	May the odds be ever in your favor
1794000	1796000	Okay alright Loki
1796000	1798000	Now you may proceed
1798000	1800000	So this week I played well Call of Duty
1800000	1802000	Of course
1802000	1804000	Also played a little bit of Borderlands
1804000	1806000	And a little bit of Just Cause 2
1806000	1808000	Had to stop playing Just Cause 2
1808000	1810000	Cause my computer felt like it was gonna melt down
1810000	1812000	Which means I had to
1812000	1814000	Make some modifications
1814000	1816000	It ended up that my cat apparently
1816000	1818000	Was using the inside of my
1818000	1820000	Or the heat fins for my
1820000	1822000	Cooler inside my
1822000	1824000	Laptop as a lint
1824000	1826000	Collector and so there was a
1826000	1828000	Nice layer of cat hair in there that I
1828000	1830000	Found when I
1830000	1832000	Disassembled everything so
1832000	1834000	Thankfully that was easily remedied and then
1834000	1836000	I drilled holes in the bottom of it
1836000	1838000	Because
1838000	1840000	These Asus laptops, the older ones
1840000	1842000	Just had really piss poor
1842000	1844000	Cooling so it's actually helped
1844000	1846000	A lot and um
1846000	1848000	It doesn't feel like I'm shooting fire
1848000	1850000	Out of the side of my laptop right now
1850000	1852000	Um and then
1852000	1854000	I got
1854000	1856000	It's never good to have a hot laptop on your crotch
1856000	1858000	Because then you really get fire crotch
1858000	1860000	Well then you have
1860000	1862000	Roasted sausage
1862000	1864000	No no I used to
1864000	1866000	I have a cooling pad
1866000	1868000	They put on there but yes before when I
1868000	1870000	Icy hot?
1870000	1872000	A metal
1872000	1874000	Metal pad with fans in it
1874000	1876000	Anyways um no but when I had
1876000	1878000	Before I had all the
1878000	1880000	Cooling modifications to it I would burn my
1880000	1882000	Legs playing games on
1882000	1884000	My laptop so yes that's
1884000	1886000	It is possible to do that
1886000	1888000	And it got so hot too that
1888000	1890000	Like I was burning my hands not
1890000	1892000	Touching my laptop on top of
1892000	1894000	My keys it was just getting that hot
1894000	1896000	I'm like okay starting to smell things
1896000	1898000	Burning probably should cool it off
1898000	1900000	Wow um so yeah
1900000	1902000	So I think we're good we're in a good spot
1902000	1904000	Now because all the other spots that I haven't
1904000	1906000	Drilled holes in don't really have any processors
1906000	1908000	Underneath them so it's probably not
1908000	1910000	Necessary um and then
1910000	1912000	Played Minecraft a bit more of that that's
1912000	1914000	Kind of fun we just started kind of exploring
1914000	1916000	The area and the new
1916000	1918000	What was it uh
1918000	1920000	Octocock Minecraft
1920000	1922000	Scene um
1922000	1924000	It's actually a very boring map so
1924000	1926000	I might want to start another one
1926000	1928000	Um and then
1928000	1930000	Um what else
1930000	1932000	Oh I have a beta key
1932000	1934000	For the little big planet carding thing
1934000	1936000	I haven't gotten a chance to try yet
1936000	1938000	Thank you Loki by the way
1938000	1940000	No problem um
1940000	1942000	And
1942000	1944000	That's pretty much it I just have a lot of stuff
1944000	1946000	I'm you know a lot of it was just
1946000	1948000	Hinging on cooling my laptop down so I can play
1948000	1950000	More Borderlands again because it was just getting
1950000	1952000	So hot I'm like I don't want to break anything
1952000	1954000	In there alright
1954000	1956000	Talking about my gaming week um I played
1956000	1958000	Borderlands a little bit I was really
1958000	1960000	Busy during the weekend because of the shadow casting
1960000	1962000	Events going on this weekend but um earlier in the week
1962000	1964000	I played Borderlands like a little more
1964000	1966000	Seriously this time I mean not
1966000	1968000	A lot a lot I only probably got to like level
1968000	1970000	10 or 11 which you know is is
1970000	1972000	Change in the scope of things but it gave
1972000	1974000	Me enough time to get a better feel for the game than what I
1974000	1976000	Played of it before and I like it it's
1976000	1978000	Kind of like I think
1978000	1980000	The description of World of Warcraft
1980000	1982000	As a first person shooter is somewhat
1982000	1984000	Accurate except it's not really an MMO
1984000	1986000	But you can play the multiplayer
1986000	1988000	That was the only thing that felt a little
1988000	1990000	Disjointed for me and like this is gonna
1990000	1992000	Sound negative but it's really not like I do really
1992000	1994000	Enjoy the game you guys but I kind of thought
1994000	1996000	It was weird that like it's the same you can use
1996000	1998000	The same character in your single player
1998000	2000000	And in multiplayer I know
2000000	2002000	You can use different too but it was
2002000	2004000	It just felt a little disjointed like here I
2004000	2006000	Am doing some quests in single player and then here
2006000	2008000	We are multiplayer and so
2008000	2010000	And so is kind of off doing this and so is off doing
2010000	2012000	This and kind of like we're all completing quests
2012000	2014000	I'm not able to really follow along I'm not
2014000	2016000	Able to get into it as easy so it's kind of like
2016000	2018000	I feel the need to play through this game
2018000	2020000	Once single player just
2020000	2022000	To like know the story
2022000	2024000	And know everything and then go back and do
2024000	2026000	Multiplayer and
2026000	2028000	Okay for real GameSpy
2028000	2030000	Is the multiplayer client like what is this
2030000	2032000	1998
2032000	2034000	But
2034000	2036000	Okay I realize the game is a few years old
2036000	2038000	I'm not gonna I'm hoping Borderlands
2038000	2040000	I'm hoping Borderlands 2 uses
2040000	2042000	Something a little more modern
2044000	2046000	That just kind of surprised me I'm like
2046000	2048000	You know I'm missing origin
2048000	2050000	Right about now Maybe it runs really well
2050000	2052000	Because no one uses GameSpy anymore
2052000	2054000	Maybe maybe maybe that's the secret
2054000	2056000	I don't know but yeah I mean
2056000	2058000	Borderlands was it's fun I mean
2058000	2060000	It's more of an actual
2060000	2062000	Like shooter than like Mass Effect
2062000	2064000	Which I was talking about before that
2064000	2066000	You know remember I said I was playing a lot of Mass Effect
2066000	2068000	Multiplayer and it makes me want to play a first person shooter
2068000	2070000	Because I'm really enjoying Mass Effect
2070000	2072000	And the most people suggested I play Borderlands
2072000	2074000	I think it was a great suggestion
2074000	2076000	It is a little more first person shootery than I'm used to
2076000	2078000	And I was surprised I couldn't dumb the difficulty
2078000	2080000	Down because I like to play my shooters in
2080000	2082000	Easy noob noob mode
2082000	2084000	But there is no difficulty
2084000	2086000	Yeah you gotta hax it though
2086000	2088000	You gotta hax it
2088000	2090000	I didn't want to do that
2090000	2092000	I'm doing alright so far
2092000	2094000	Multiplayer kicked our butt
2094000	2096000	Like because the enemies get so much stronger
2096000	2098000	And now it's not just one guy running around
2098000	2100000	Not knowing what they're doing it's three
2100000	2102000	This is me and two buddies of mine
2102000	2104000	We can certainly play later on
2104000	2106000	I know Bobby's got it, Allen's got it now
2106000	2108000	Lots of people in the Borderlands
2108000	2110000	Otherwise for me I've been playing
2110000	2112000	A lot of the same stuff
2112000	2114000	Otherwise not a lot of new new stuff
2114000	2116000	This week you know World of Warcraft
2116000	2118000	And all that good stuff
2118000	2120000	I'm eagerly awaiting
2120000	2122000	Thanks to Loki I got a beta test code
2122000	2124000	For the little big planet karting
2124000	2126000	Super excited to try that out
2126000	2128000	Play it as quickly as possible because it ends like Wednesday
2128000	2130000	Oh no I'll download it tonight
2130000	2132000	Play it Monday and Tuesday night or something
2132000	2134000	Let you guys know my impressions on that next week
2134000	2136000	That ought to be of interest to the Playstation home folks
2136000	2138000	Because that's a Sony exclusive
2138000	2140000	We got some codes that we can give away too
2140000	2142000	You say we have extra codes to give away?
2142000	2144000	Yeah we do
2144000	2146000	Maybe we need to do a giveaway tonight
2146000	2148000	In the Playstation home clubhouse
2148000	2150000	That'd be fun
2150000	2152000	I think like three extra codes
2152000	2154000	We'll think of a way to do a contest
2154000	2156000	I don't want to ignore the folks in our live chat room either
2156000	2158000	Maybe we'll give some codes away in some different places tonight
2162000	2164000	Guess Marissa's cup size is the contest?
2164000	2166000	I can guess what it is
2166000	2168000	I told you
2168000	2170000	I don't know about that
2170000	2172000	Alright
2172000	2174000	I gotta keep it
2174000	2176000	We might be a mature show
2176000	2178000	But I want to keep it somewhat
2178000	2180000	PG-13 at least in home
2180000	2182000	Out of respect to the community
2182000	2184000	Keep it a little PG-13 there
2184000	2186000	Too big is the answer
2186000	2188000	Alright
2188000	2190000	Shane is messaging me
2190000	2192000	Going I want a freaking code
2192000	2194000	Well Shane that's what you get for bragging about
2194000	2196000	The Playstation all stars
2196000	2198000	Network battle
2198000	2200000	Royale thingy that you were in the beta for
2200000	2202000	And I was like let me play
2202000	2204000	You know what his answer was? No
2204000	2208000	Alright
2208000	2210000	Let's move on
2210000	2212000	I think we covered everybody's gaming week
2212000	2214000	Yes yes yes alright
2214000	2216000	Housekeeping
2216000	2218000	I want to talk about this
2218000	2220000	This is something a little special
2220000	2222000	No this is serious for a minute
2222000	2224000	A little special and unique on the VoG network
2224000	2226000	And I think this is really cool
2226000	2228000	And kind of shows some of the different stuff we can do
2228000	2230000	So next week after Orange Lounge Radio
2230000	2232000	That's right after Orange Lounge Radio
2232000	2234000	I think we've been doing this show like 10 years
2234000	2236000	Have we ever had another show follow us?
2236000	2238000	Like usually we're the last show of the night right?
2238000	2240000	Because it's like 1am on the east coast by the time
2240000	2242000	We're done sometimes
2242000	2244000	Well next week there is going to be a special
2244000	2246000	Show following us
2246000	2248000	At VoG network.com
2248000	2250000	I know it's very late
2250000	2252000	I know it's a long time to stay up
2252000	2254000	But this is very cool
2254000	2256000	Travis Donovan from Understation Live
2256000	2258000	Is going to be doing a special live
2258000	2260000	VoG coverage of the Mars
2260000	2262000	City Landing
2262000	2264000	So I think that's really cool
2264000	2266000	Like Travis if you listen to
2266000	2268000	Understation Live at all which is on Saturday nights
2268000	2270000	At VoG 7 o'clock Pacific
2270000	2272000	He loves space
2272000	2274000	He loves NASA he loves the space program
2274000	2276000	Is he the best at space?
2276000	2278000	He might be which by the way before I forget
2278000	2280000	Rest in peace Sally Ride for real
2280000	2282000	Sally Ride
2282000	2284000	Not just all the stuff that came out afterwards
2284000	2286000	But just Sally Ride
2286000	2288000	I was around 5 or 6 when she first went into space
2288000	2290000	And I don't
2290000	2292000	I don't even know
2292000	2294000	How to put this like at such a young
2294000	2296000	Age you're like even so happy
2296000	2298000	To see like a female go
2298000	2300000	Into space like
2300000	2302000	And you kind of wonder as a kid
2302000	2304000	Like on one hand you wonder why is it
2304000	2306000	Such a big deal but on the other hand
2306000	2308000	You're like you feel like a lot of like happiness
2308000	2310000	And pride for kind of like that equality
2310000	2312000	I remember feeling that at a young age
2312000	2314000	And I'm not even a girl like I guess I was a feminist
2314000	2316000	At 5 years old who knew but
2316000	2318000	Anyway Sally Ride
2318000	2320000	Amazing inspiration to men and women
2320000	2322000	Everywhere
2322000	2324000	Out of current events I didn't realize
2324000	2326000	We had set up another
2326000	2328000	Like
2328000	2330000	That's just a one time special
2330000	2332000	No not that I'm talking about
2332000	2334000	Sending something to Mars
2334000	2336000	I didn't even realize that we had
2336000	2338000	Sent anything else to Mars
2338000	2340000	I thought they were like ahhhh
2340000	2342000	We fucked up that last rover
2342000	2344000	We're done
2344000	2346000	I mean that's cool
2346000	2348000	Well you know what you should
2348000	2350000	Tune in to Travis' special
2350000	2352000	Next week you might learn something
2352000	2354000	Makes sense that now they have all these Mars landing games
2354000	2356000	Like who cares about landing on Mars now
2356000	2358000	I mean that's like so old
2358000	2360000	And what the hell is the world turning to when I'm learning things
2360000	2362000	From Travis Donovan
2362000	2364000	Love you
2364000	2366000	Alright
2366000	2368000	So I did want to plug that
2368000	2370000	Of course I want to plug our Facebook community
2370000	2372000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
2372000	2374000	We are on Twitter as well
2374000	2376000	You can follow us at at OLR
2376000	2378000	Or you can follow the voice of geeks network as a whole
2378000	2380000	VOG network
2380000	2382000	VOG network did grow in the past couple weeks
2382000	2384000	With a few new shows
2384000	2386000	Critical Myth and British Invaders
2386000	2388000	Want to give them a shout out
2388000	2390000	Great great television and discussion shows
2390000	2392000	They're both fantastic shows
2392000	2394000	And so happy to have them on the lineup
2394000	2396000	And of course one more shout out
2396000	2398000	To the folks right now doing the running man
2398000	2400000	Or just hanging out whatever they're doing
2400000	2402000	Playstation Summerfest is going on right now
2402000	2404000	Looks like it's thinned out a little bit
2404000	2406000	There was a lot more people in there during Bobby's show
2406000	2408000	But you know it's getting late
2408000	2410000	On the east coast
2410000	2412000	Some people got to go to bed sometimes
2412000	2414000	Alright moving on
2414000	2416000	Let's get into some gaming news
2416000	2418000	I think we're just on the other side of the camera
2418000	2420000	Oh was the camera just facing the wrong way?
2420000	2422000	Oh my god someone made
2422000	2424000	A chibi garris plushie
2424000	2426000	I see from back here I see it
2426000	2428000	Junebug says thank you everyone very much
2428000	2430000	Awesome job vog
2430000	2432000	Thank you Junebug!
2432000	2434000	She won a $20 gift card during Bobby Black Wolf's show tonight
2434000	2436000	For Playstation Network and she called in
2436000	2438000	And I thought that was amazing
2438000	2440000	Shout out Junebug
2440000	2442000	Loki starting us off tonight
2442000	2444000	With exclusive news
2444000	2446000	Maybe?
2446000	2448000	I don't have all the details on this yet
2448000	2450000	But it was interesting
2450000	2452000	It's a test that they're doing
2452000	2454000	Apparently it was that new
2454000	2456000	Nike Plus
2456000	2458000	A fitness game for Kinect
2458000	2460000	That's coming out this fall
2460000	2462000	Is going to require a subscription
2462000	2464000	Service
2464000	2466000	In order to play the game
2466000	2468000	Now I'm not sure exactly how that works
2468000	2470000	Because I was asking him some questions
2470000	2472000	He was basically
2472000	2474000	The rep we had at Microsoft
2474000	2476000	Was kind of using this
2476000	2478000	Hey we can sell some more points cards using this
2478000	2480000	I'm like aren't people going to be kind of pissed off
2480000	2482000	That you guys are charging 400 Microsoft points a month
2482000	2484000	For the service
2484000	2486000	I guess it's for stat tracking
2486000	2488000	And something like that
2488000	2490000	Now he said
2490000	2492000	Because I don't know too much about this game
2492000	2494000	He said that the game will not work unless you pay
2494000	2496000	This monthly fee
2496000	2498000	So I'm not sure what exactly
2498000	2500000	Is entailed there
2500000	2502000	If it's just going to not track your progress
2502000	2504000	That's what the monthly fee is for
2504000	2506000	Or if it's just
2506000	2508000	Going to plain straight up not work
2508000	2510000	Unless you have like
2510000	2512000	A pass or something
2512000	2514000	If you don't pay us
2514000	2516000	You will get fat
2516000	2518000	I don't know
2518000	2520000	See my thought is
2520000	2522000	I was just kind of
2522000	2524000	Why
2524000	2526000	Why are you guys doing this
2526000	2528000	Aren't people going to look at this kind of negative
2528000	2530000	Because I even brought up the typical things
2530000	2532000	I love that you called him out on it
2532000	2534000	You guys
2534000	2536000	You have your gold service that people are paying for
2536000	2538000	Aren't you guys kind of worried that
2538000	2540000	This might look bad
2540000	2542000	They're charging a fee
2542000	2544000	On top of this
2544000	2546000	It's just a test right now
2546000	2548000	So I don't know
2548000	2550000	This is a test
2550000	2552000	This is only a test
2552000	2554000	That's me sucking money out of your wallet
2554000	2556000	We'll have to see what
2556000	2558000	We'll have to see what exactly this is
2558000	2560000	When it comes out
2560000	2562000	Because I'm sure that he didn't have all the details
2562000	2564000	Trust me, I know reps for companies
2564000	2566000	That don't know what the fuck they're talking about
2566000	2568000	When it comes to product
2568000	2570000	And so
2570000	2572000	It's very possible that he got some stuff wrong
2572000	2574000	Or just wasn't clear on things
2574000	2576000	Maybe it's just this whole
2576000	2578000	Stat tracking thing that's extra
2578000	2580000	Or something
2580000	2582000	But I still don't like the fact that a game
2582000	2584000	Is requiring you for a monthly fee
2584000	2586000	For something that should be
2586000	2588000	In my opinion included with it
2588000	2590000	So
2590000	2592000	We will see when this comes out
2592000	2594000	And if it does require this
2594000	2596000	That kind of sucks for them
2596000	2598000	There's plenty of fitness games out there
2598000	2600000	For the Xbox 360
2600000	2602000	This has to be something super special
2602000	2604000	The Nike Plus has
2604000	2606000	That whole
2606000	2608000	Will it integrate with the shoes?
2608000	2610000	It's going to integrate with that stuff
2610000	2612000	Maybe that's what it is
2612000	2614000	I don't know if Nike Plus
2614000	2616000	As a service
2616000	2618000	The one with your shoes
2618000	2620000	If that requires a fee
2620000	2622000	Maybe it's something like that
2622000	2624000	All I know is they're saying
2624000	2626000	So
2626000	2628000	Yep
2628000	2630000	Five bucks a month
2630000	2632000	I wonder if that will have to be right
2632000	2634000	There on the front of the box
2634000	2636000	That they're going to be charging that
2636000	2638000	It won't be
2638000	2640000	That's scary
2640000	2642000	Then what are you getting?
2642000	2644000	I can see if there's a premium club
2644000	2646000	I guess that's no different from Call of Duty
2646000	2648000	That's what it's going to be
2648000	2650000	Maybe
2650000	2652000	If you subscribe to this
2652000	2654000	And you're out of it
2654000	2656000	That would make sense to me
2656000	2658000	It would be a huge mistake
2658000	2660000	To say this game requires
2660000	2662000	All this DLC
2662000	2664000	But that's how he phrased it
2664000	2666000	Maybe it's just
2666000	2668000	Him misinterpreting
2668000	2670000	The information he's been given
2670000	2672000	It's possible
2672000	2674000	But I'm just reporting
2674000	2676000	What I've been told
2676000	2678000	400 Microsoft Points a month
2678000	2680000	Some people have mixed success
2680000	2682000	Rates with those fitness games
2682000	2684000	Brad is talking to me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
2684000	2686000	Right now and he says
2686000	2688000	Talking about fitness games
2688000	2690000	Christina got a
2690000	2692000	Your shape game
2692000	2694000	And while doing one of the initial
2694000	2696000	Setup scans it told her
2696000	2698000	Straighten your back
2698000	2700000	And they cracked up because she has scoliosis
2700000	2702000	So her response was
2702000	2704000	Good luck with that
2704000	2710000	Marissa you're...
2710000	2712000	I can imagine Marissa playing
2712000	2714000	The Your Shape game
2714000	2716000	You seem a little top heavy
2716000	2718000	I can't straighten my back either
2718000	2720000	I have thighs
2720000	2722000	Put down your groceries
2722000	2724000	Stop carrying that baby
2724000	2726000	Please put down the watermelons
2726000	2728000	Please
2730000	2732000	I'll do ooches braziers later
2732000	2734000	Alright
2734000	2736000	Anything else on this topic
2736000	2738000	Low key or can I move on
2738000	2740000	One more thing I forgot
2740000	2742000	I mentioned this week
2742000	2744000	I played Dead or Alive 5
2744000	2746000	The near final build of that
2746000	2748000	That's kind of cool
2748000	2750000	But I don't play Dead or Alive
2750000	2752000	So it was button mash fest
2752000	2754000	I didn't do very well with that until I switched to Ryu
2754000	2756000	And then I fucking kicked ass
2756000	2758000	He apparently is pretty conducive for button mashing
2758000	2760000	It looks pretty though
2760000	2762000	Is Dead or Alive
2762000	2764000	I made a huge faux pas by the way
2764000	2766000	Christina is a girlfriend not a wife
2766000	2768000	My bad
2768000	2770000	Awkward
2770000	2772000	Sorry guys
2772000	2776000	Back and away
2776000	2782000	Did I mention what a great show pod culture is
2782000	2784000	And you should all listen to it
2784000	2786000	So that I can be forgiven
2786000	2790000	Monday nights 6 o'clock
2790000	2794000	Awkward time at the dinner table
2798000	2800000	Rob is red now
2800000	2802000	Don't worry it's just like when people say
2802000	2804000	So Alan's your roommate?
2804000	2808000	Well yeah we do live together
2808000	2810000	In the same room
2810000	2814000	And have mating practices
2814000	2818000	Alright hey let's move on to Windows 8
2818000	2822000	Marissa it's going to turn into the giggle show
2822000	2826000	She's over there making like she's digging a hole
2826000	2830000	Let's talk about someone who's almost as awesome as Brad from pod culture
2830000	2832000	Gabe Newell
2832000	2836000	And he's talking about Windows 8
2836000	2838000	He's not a fan
2838000	2840000	You know Windows 8 is coming out towards the end of the year
2840000	2842000	I believe it's been a year
2842000	2846000	I believe it's been officially dated for October 26
2846000	2848000	And it's going to be coming out
2848000	2850000	And a lot of people are excited about Windows 8
2850000	2852000	But one of them that is not excited about Windows 8
2852000	2854000	Gabe Newell
2854000	2856000	He says quote a catastrophe
2856000	2858000	He just straight up called it a catastrophe
2858000	2860000	And that's according to all things D
2860000	2864000	I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space
2864000	2866000	I think we'll lose some of the top tier PC OEMs
2866000	2868000	Who will exit the market
2868000	2870000	I think margins will be destroyed
2870000	2872000	For a bunch of people
2872000	2874000	If that's true then it will be good to have alternatives to hedge
2874000	2876000	Against that eventually
2876000	2878000	And that is a follow up to Steam being on Linux
2878000	2880000	That is actually
2880000	2882000	Now that you kind of hear that
2882000	2884000	You're like damn that's genius
2884000	2886000	That's a proactive move by Steam
2886000	2890000	Just in case Windows 8 is a gigantic fucking bomb
2890000	2892000	That it turns people off
2892000	2894000	That's a pretty big risk in a way
2894000	2896000	I mean I'm sure the Linux folks are happy
2896000	2898000	That's crazy that all of a sudden old versions of Windows 8
2898000	2900000	Just disappear and become Windows 8
2900000	2902000	That is a little interesting but
2902000	2904000	I mean gee what's going to happen to all those computers
2904000	2906000	Running those older OS's
2906000	2908000	And people not upgrading
2908000	2910000	Oh I guess everything will work as usual
2910000	2912000	That's odd
2912000	2914000	Alright
2914000	2916000	But hey I guess you know you've got to be prepared
2916000	2918000	For the apocalypse
2918000	2920000	I want to come back to what Gabe Newell said in a minute
2920000	2922000	Because he said something else
2922000	2924000	That was really fascinating
2924000	2928000	And I definitely want Jamie to hear it
2928000	2930000	But in the meantime I want to talk about Blizzard
2930000	2932000	You know the makers of World of Warcraft
2932000	2934000	And Starcraft, Diablo
2934000	2936000	You might have heard of these games
2936000	2938000	They're kind of big in PC
2938000	2940000	Just if you haven't heard
2940000	2942000	They have a new game coming out this year
2942000	2944000	Pandaria right
2944000	2946000	Ok so
2946000	2948000	Blizzard is kind of on board with this
2948000	2950000	It was according to Twitter
2950000	2952000	And a comment from game designer
2952000	2954000	Rob Pardo
2954000	2956000	He said on Twitter
2956000	2958000	Nice interview with Gabe Newell
2958000	2960000	I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space
2960000	2962000	Not awesome for Blizzard either
2962000	2964000	Now keep in mind
2964000	2966000	This is one guy at Blizzard
2966000	2968000	But when he is a game designer
2968000	2970000	Yeah
2970000	2972000	So there you go
2972000	2974000	Not some good early feedback
2974000	2976000	I'm hoping this isn't going to go over
2976000	2978000	Windows ME or something
2978000	2980000	Or Windows Vista
2980000	2982000	Even Marista
2982000	2984000	The non-gamer is sitting over there going
2984000	2986000	Oh so cold, so cold
2986000	2988000	Wait give Marista the mic
2988000	2990000	Marista you are not a fan of Windows ME
2990000	2992000	No I've actually had it in many offices
2992000	2994000	I've been the legal secretary
2994000	2996000	At many points in my life
2996000	2998000	And attorneys are very cheap
2998000	3000000	I've had to try to work with Windows ME
3000000	3002000	I still have nightmares
3004000	3006000	Alright
3006000	3008000	Let me go back to the Gabe Newell thing in a minute
3008000	3010000	Alright Jamie listen up
3010000	3012000	I know this is software that is a big part
3012000	3014000	Of what you do
3014000	3016000	Because Gabe Newell kind of alluded
3016000	3018000	To programs like Adobe
3018000	3020000	Like Photoshop
3020000	3022000	That causes us to have conversations
3022000	3024000	With Adobe and we say
3024000	3026000	The next version of Photoshop
3026000	3028000	Should look like a free to play game
3028000	3030000	And they say
3030000	3032000	We have absolutely no idea what you are talking about
3032000	3034000	But it sounds really bad
3034000	3036000	And what he means by that
3036000	3038000	Is that he is saying you know
3038000	3040000	People make money on things like
3040000	3042000	Team Fortress
3042000	3044000	Team Fortress 2 excuse me that are free to play
3044000	3046000	One steam user apparently making
3046000	3048000	$150,000 a year selling hats
3048000	3050000	In Team Fortress 2
3050000	3052000	So he sort of goes to something like Adobe Photoshop
3052000	3054000	And says what if your platform
3054000	3056000	Was free
3056000	3058000	But you sold the little bits
3058000	3060000	That's at least what I am reading into this
3060000	3062000	You sell the little bits and pieces
3062000	3064000	You sell the advanced filters
3064000	3066000	And all of that
3066000	3068000	How would you feel if Photoshop looked like that?
3068000	3070000	Dark Sakura?
3070000	3072000	Well there are other programs that look like that
3072000	3074000	And that's why I don't use them
3074000	3076000	Oh really?
3076000	3078000	Yeah I mean I could use GIMP
3078000	3080000	I love GIMP too
3080000	3082000	But I want what Photoshop does
3082000	3084000	So I use Photoshop
3084000	3086000	Let's have real talk for a minute
3086000	3088000	Aren't there a lot of people that just pirate Photoshop
3088000	3090000	I mean isn't that what
3090000	3092000	Isn't that what Newell is kind of
3092000	3094000	Trying to get at
3094000	3096000	Well people are
3096000	3098000	Pirating it anyway
3098000	3100000	So why don't you just make it free for everybody
3100000	3102000	And then add the features
3102000	3104000	Because that's not going to work
3104000	3106000	There's plenty of companies that are still going to
3106000	3108000	Buy the official ones for their
3108000	3110000	Designers
3110000	3112000	At a design firm
3112000	3114000	There are plenty of professionals who are going to have licensed copies
3114000	3116000	Because they can't produce
3116000	3118000	Work for a profit situation
3118000	3120000	If they are using a pirated
3120000	3122000	Version
3122000	3124000	They have to have licensing
3124000	3126000	Even free to play stuff
3126000	3128000	Sometimes has that pay tier
3128000	3130000	Like a lot of MMOs
3130000	3132000	Like Star Trek Online or DC Universe or whatever
3132000	3134000	Yeah it's free but then if you pay the monthly fee
3134000	3136000	You get your Uber access or whatever
3136000	3138000	Yeah Marisa
3138000	3140000	I would be happy to pay
3140000	3142000	If it was a little more reasonable
3142000	3144000	For those of us who aren't using it under a professional capacity
3144000	3146000	Well that's what surprised me about
3146000	3148000	Windows 8
3148000	3150000	The price, you know a lot of people are shocked about
3150000	3152000	Windows 8 price but some people
3152000	3154000	Infer that that's coming from the Mac side of things
3154000	3156000	Where you know I think the latest Mac upgrade
3156000	3158000	Was what 20, 30 bucks
3158000	3160000	Don't quote me on that because I don't have a Mac to upgrade
3160000	3162000	Right now
3162000	3164000	But yeah a lot of people are saying that
3164000	3166000	Windows 8 is a cheap upgrade because of that
3166000	3168000	So interesting counter move
3168000	3170000	I like 7
3170000	3172000	7 does what it needs to do
3172000	3174000	And it
3174000	3176000	I just think that
3176000	3178000	And this is the whole reason why more and more
3178000	3180000	People you know basically are leaving
3180000	3182000	The PC and Mac universe to
3182000	3184000	Head over to Linux because they want
3184000	3186000	To have the control over what they install
3186000	3188000	In their systems like I love
3188000	3190000	Linux because if I want my
3190000	3192000	System to be optimized for graphics
3192000	3194000	Over like say sound
3194000	3196000	All I have to do is install a new kernel
3196000	3198000	That's optimized for graphics
3198000	3200000	Done
3200000	3202000	Or optimized for system speed
3202000	3204000	Done. I can switch between the two
3204000	3206000	If I want to
3206000	3208000	You know I have all of my programs
3208000	3210000	I can download them through one place
3210000	3212000	Yes but they've been tested and
3212000	3214000	Worked for my system I can still
3214000	3216000	Go through other means to download the programs
3216000	3218000	That I want. I love Linux
3218000	3220000	I'm running Linux Mint right now
3220000	3222000	On my netbook which
3222000	3224000	You know was half the size of the Windows
3224000	3226000	Install that came on it
3226000	3228000	And it uses I think
3228000	3230000	A third of the memory resources
3230000	3232000	That Windows does
3232000	3234000	But is it efficient for porn?
3234000	3236000	Yes I can watch porn on it
3236000	3238000	He's efficient for porn
3238000	3240000	Hey porno box I love you Linux
3240000	3242000	I just got done
3242000	3244000	Looking up a bunch of mass effect porn
3244000	3246000	I mean
3246000	3248000	You mean deviantart research
3248000	3250000	Whatever
3250000	3252000	I'm
3252000	3254000	I'm doing
3254000	3256000	Work
3256000	3258000	If a computer from
3258000	3260000	Back in the 90's is efficient for porn
3260000	3262000	Which mine was
3262000	3264000	They're slow let's be real
3264000	3266000	A netbook can easily look up porn
3266000	3268000	I mean Loki I know you were the kid
3268000	3270000	Like me who dialed into all the BBS's
3270000	3272000	To download porn? It took time
3272000	3274000	That was dedication because if that picture
3274000	3276000	Because if that picture
3276000	3278000	Sucked then oh my god
3278000	3280000	You've just wasted a good like
3280000	3282000	30 minutes
3282000	3284000	And we were thankful back in my day
3284000	3286000	Pornography
3286000	3288000	Was logging onto the local
3288000	3290000	BBS to see Snow White
3290000	3292000	Gangbanged by seven dwarves
3292000	3294000	Animated gifs
3294000	3296000	They
3296000	3298000	Weren't even animated it was just

3308000	3318000	Two miles uphill in the snow
3318000	3320000	Go find an old abandonware
3320000	3322000	Archive somewhere and download an old
3322000	3324000	School strip poker game from like 1984
3324000	3326000	For what was called

3328000	3330000	But for what's called a CGA monitor
3330000	3332000	Does anybody know
3332000	3334000	What a CGA monitor does

3336000	3338000	Okay I have a dirty
3338000	3340000	Porn story
3340000	3342000	My favorite
3342000	3344000	Safe for your audience though but it's funny that you mention
3344000	3346000	That you know with you know with the
3346000	3348000	Internet and internet pornography it's amazing
3348000	3350000	Actually how much of a backlog

3352000	3354000	That are on the internet I found out
3354000	3356000	That a friend of mine
3356000	3358000	Had a
3358000	3360000	A gentleman had done
3360000	3362000	Porn and
3362000	3364000	I was there for this this was funny

3366000	3368000	Yeah and um
3368000	3370000	The Wii came out
3370000	3372000	Yeah and um
3372000	3374000	Now I understand why when we were doing
3374000	3376000	The whole cute little like find out your porn star
3376000	3378000	Name game now I understand why he thought that game
3378000	3380000	Was so funny
3380000	3382000	Now I understand like he didn't
3382000	3384000	Yeah well I managed to
3384000	3386000	Look it up and uh
3386000	3388000	I found it it was like 94
3388000	3390000	I also found out that he hadn't changed his
3390000	3392000	Comforter and I had house sat for him once
3392000	3394000	And I was grossed out
3394000	3396000	Because they shot it at his house
3396000	3398000	Did you run and take a shower immediately?
3398000	3400000	Yes
3400000	3402000	He had a chair it was just so comfort
3402000	3404000	I slept in the bed I was watching his house
3404000	3406000	And I took a screenshot of his own face
3406000	3408000	And I sent it to all his friends
3408000	3410000	Wow
3410000	3412000	That is a cunty thing to do
3412000	3414000	Oh my god
3414000	3416000	I'm sorry if that word offends you
3416000	3418000	Alright I didn't want to go there
3418000	3420000	That is like drag queen level
3420000	3422000	See you next Tuesday
3422000	3424000	That would be the truth
3424000	3426000	But the problem was Rob
3426000	3428000	You sent a picture of his own face to all of his friends
3428000	3430000	I had dated him
3430000	3432000	And he did not tell me
3432000	3434000	Okay
3434000	3436000	I didn't want to
3436000	3438000	I didn't want to have to make that confession
3438000	3440000	But yes
3440000	3442000	I have fucked a porn star
3442000	3444000	Congratulations
3444000	3446000	Yay
3446000	3448000	The things we learned on Orange Lounge Radio
3448000	3450000	In retrospect his technique
3450000	3452000	Makes a lot more sense now
3454000	3456000	Now I look back
3456000	3458000	Oh
3458000	3460000	By technique meaning
3460000	3462000	That he uses the same techniques that butchers use
3462000	3464000	For like tenderizing meats
3464000	3466000	Or perhaps that you're like
3466000	3468000	Man were you like a butter churner
3468000	3470000	In your past life or something
3472000	3474000	I just want to give another hello to the Playstation
3474000	3476000	Homers joining us for the first time
3476000	3478000	At the Voice of Geeks Network
3478000	3480000	These are the things geeks have to say
3480000	3482000	Who knew? Well you know what
3482000	3484000	There's a comment coming from Playstation Home
3484000	3486000	From Manda Panda 1979
3486000	3488000	Snow White banging the seven dwarves
3488000	3490000	Hot!
3490000	3492000	It really wasn't that hot
3492000	3494000	But yet we were 13 and loved it
3494000	3496000	One of the days of the pornos he was in
3496000	3498000	Was called Country Western Cuties
3498000	3500000	Nude pie eating contest
3500000	3502000	And he
3502000	3504000	And he
3504000	3506000	Bob is on the floor literally
3506000	3508000	He was actually
3508000	3510000	A country singer songwriter
3510000	3512000	That's how I knew him
3512000	3514000	Okay for the record
3514000	3516000	I had just broken up with my boyfriend
3516000	3518000	It was a very dark time for me
3518000	3520000	And now I
3520000	3522000	So how about video games?
3522000	3524000	That email actually said to all my friends
3524000	3526000	Had said I have a present for you
3526000	3528000	And I had the
3528000	3530000	Screen cap of Zo face and in
3530000	3532000	Porny font it said you're welcome
3532000	3534000	It's a pie eating contest
3534000	3536000	I'm
3536000	3538000	So sorry
3538000	3540000	Oh yeah and by the way I actually had asked
3540000	3542000	A bunch of my friends to tune in
3542000	3544000	This evening
3544000	3546000	Who were not aware of the story
3546000	3548000	So now they know a lot more about me
3548000	3550000	Than I never cared to have them know
3550000	3552000	I'm surprised that that's the title of it
3552000	3554000	That's actually pretty
3554000	3556000	You know
3556000	3558000	It's not bad for a porn title
3558000	3560000	I mean there's
3560000	3562000	No we're talking like actual pies
3562000	3564000	And not like pies in the
3564000	3566000	Pornographic sense
3566000	3568000	That's where my mind went
3568000	3570000	I've been literally rolling on the floor laughing
3570000	3572000	So hard
3572000	3574000	You're welcome
3574000	3576000	I apologize
3576000	3578000	I'd like to take this moment to apologize
3578000	3580000	Can we get to the games please?
3580000	3582000	Maybe
3582000	3584000	Chigurh says
3584000	3586000	That I'm going all Anderson Cooper right now
3586000	3588000	Rob was
3588000	3590000	Literally on the floor
3590000	3592000	You know what's funny is I had some people
3592000	3594000	Come up to you during the game summit thing
3594000	3596000	That we had at our work and everything
3596000	3598000	And they're like hey so I have some libraries
3598000	3600000	And stuff that might be interesting in podcast
3600000	3602000	And I'm like did you realize this is a pretty adult podcast
3602000	3604000	Like we use some colorful languages
3604000	3606000	And they're like yeah that's okay
3606000	3608000	Are you sure you know what you're getting into?
3608000	3610000	Well if Catcher in the Rye is at the library
3610000	3612000	I mean
3612000	3614000	They're not my customers
3614000	3616000	Okay
3616000	3618000	Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
3618000	3620000	Says I'm so glad this is
3620000	3622000	The OLR live I get to
3622000	3624000	Come back to after so much time away
3624000	3626000	Please don't put this on the wiki
3626000	3628000	Somehow
3628000	3630000	Windows 8 led to that
3630000	3632000	Discussion
3632000	3634000	To register
3634000	3636000	Participation for this week's episode of Orange
3636000	3638000	Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com
3638000	3640000	Use the passphrase
3640000	3642000	Olive
3642000	3644000	So DarkSakura
3644000	3646000	Why don't you try to bring us back to games
3646000	3648000	Here with another story
3648000	3650000	More porn please
3650000	3652000	No not that
3652000	3654000	Square
3654000	3656000	Is saying that
3656000	3658000	Versus 13
3658000	3660000	Is going to still be out
3660000	3662000	And they still are not showing shit about it
3662000	3664000	But they are watching porn
3664000	3666000	No
3666000	3668000	There was basically
3668000	3670000	A statement by
3670000	3672000	Yoichi Wada saying that
3672000	3674000	Someone was spreading a rumor about Versus being
3674000	3676000	Cancelled
3676000	3678000	They said that he just left a regularly scheduled
3678000	3680000	Meeting for Versus and quote says
3680000	3682000	If you were to see
3682000	3684000	The city
3684000	3686000	Etc presented today
3686000	3688000	You wouldn't be able to stand
3688000	3690000	From surprise
3690000	3692000	Because everybody thinks the game is dead
3692000	3694000	Yeah
3694000	3696000	Could it be though I mean okay
3696000	3698000	Cancelled but weren't there a lot of
3698000	3700000	You know kind of rumor I mean granted this is
3700000	3702000	All rumors or whatever that it could be a different
3702000	3704000	Name now
3704000	3706000	I don't know they just said that they're still
3706000	3708000	Running it under the luminous engine
3708000	3710000	Well I know that's a lot of what we talked about because when the story
3710000	3712000	Came up last week we were here but
3712000	3714000	We hypothesized
3714000	3716000	It doesn't say anything about it
3716000	3718000	Final Fantasy 13 a sequel
3718000	3720000	Reborn
3720000	3722000	I see what you did there
3722000	3724000	We'll come back to that
3724000	3726000	Dark Sakura what do you think of Final Fantasy 13
3726000	3728000	Versus does it look like something you play?
3728000	3730000	Given that I didn't play the first 13 more than
3730000	3732000	The level then I kind of
3732000	3734000	I'm not interested in it
3734000	3736000	Well keep in mind Versus is more Kingdom Hearts ish
3736000	3738000	In the way it plays then I play Kingdom Hearts
3738000	3740000	I mean seriously
3740000	3742000	I'm kind of spent on the Final Fantasy
3742000	3744000	Franchise I kind of don't care
3744000	3746000	About it anymore
3746000	3748000	14 didn't help but we'll get back to that later
3748000	3750000	I didn't play 12
3750000	3752000	I tried to play 13 and I thought it wasn't
3752000	3754000	Great and I'm really not
3754000	3756000	Invested in the universe so
3756000	3758000	I think honestly between
3758000	3760000	13 and 13
3760000	3762000	Versus is pretty much just like
3762000	3764000	Joel Schumacher Batman and
3764000	3766000	You know
3766000	3768000	A different Batman Final Fantasy 14
3768000	3770000	Was kind of the Batman and Robin of the series
3770000	3772000	Right now it's kind of like
3772000	3774000	We had to hire
3774000	3776000	Who's like a big
3776000	3778000	We had to hire Steven Spielberg to redo
3778000	3780000	Batman and Robin like that's what's going
3780000	3782000	On in Final Fantasy 14 right now
3782000	3784000	Alright let's move on with
3784000	3786000	Some more news while I get a drink of water
3786000	3788000	Because my face still hurts from laughing so hard
3788000	3790000	Damn you Marissa this is why
3790000	3792000	You haven't been on this show because you kill me
3792000	3794000	Every time
3794000	3796000	I'm trying to take
3796000	3798000	I'm on the Facebook app right now
3798000	3800000	I'm trying to take down the leak I sent all my friends
3800000	3802000	Inviting them to listen in
3806000	3808000	Not all of them knew that
3808000	3810000	It's okay though it is funny
3810000	3812000	I love you so much right now
3812000	3814000	I can't even
3814000	3816000	Alright so what was his porn star name?
3816000	3818000	No
3818000	3820000	Everybody's gonna
3820000	3822000	Google it now
3822000	3824000	Let's move on
3824000	3826000	Games, video games, gaming culture
3826000	3828000	That's what we do here at O.L.R.
3828000	3830000	Alright
3830000	3832000	So let's talk about Ouya
3832000	3834000	Ouya is that you know
3834000	3836000	Wonderful 99 dollar console that's being
3836000	3838000	Created through Kickstarter of course
3838000	3840000	And they made some announcements
3840000	3842000	Including that the streaming service
3842000	3844000	OnLive will be coming to the system
3844000	3846000	As well, not a big surprise since
3846000	3848000	OnLive runs on Android and it's an Android
3848000	3850000	Device so it makes sense to me
3850000	3852000	That it would be on there
3852000	3854000	But of course OnLive has been
3854000	3856000	They committed that they will deliver a full console class
3856000	3858000	Experience and bring hundreds
3858000	3860000	Of top tier games for more than
3860000	3862000	80 publishers, more marketing speak
3862000	3864000	Marketing speak, marketing speak
3864000	3866000	And then of course at the same time
3866000	3868000	They also showed the second half of that
3868000	3870000	Concept picture for
3870000	3872000	The Ouya controller and
3872000	3874000	Yeah looks like the second half of the controller
3874000	3876000	What do you expect
3876000	3878000	And of course everyone's like oh I don't like that d-pad
3878000	3880000	Well everything's still not finalized
3880000	3882000	It's just a concept picture
3882000	3884000	But now you have your second half and wow
3884000	3886000	It looks like what you thought it would look like
3890000	3892000	The Ouya, the OnLive
3892000	3894000	Everything is a really interesting back door
3894000	3896000	To get the big games on
3896000	3898000	Ouya because you remember a couple
3898000	3900000	Of weeks ago we were you know kind of having our
3900000	3902000	Skepticism chat about should we fund
3902000	3904000	This or not and we were talking about
3904000	3906000	You know how they're doing this poll to see what
3906000	3908000	Games people want on Ouya and it's all this
3908000	3910000	First party stuff is what people really want
3910000	3912000	It's like dude this box is not going to be powerful enough
3912000	3914000	To run you know Mass Effect 3
3914000	3916000	Or something like that but
3916000	3918000	Thanks to OnLive technology
3918000	3920000	I mean you could play Assassin's Creed
3920000	3922000	Or you know whatever the games are
3922000	3924000	That are on Ouya
3924000	3926000	Borderlands is one of them I know that
3926000	3928000	And I don't believe
3928000	3930000	A publisher can say
3930000	3932000	No we don't want our game pushed to
3932000	3934000	Such and such I don't think
3934000	3936000	Yeah so that is
3936000	3938000	I gotta say that's a really
3938000	3940000	Smart partnership
3940000	3942000	Because you're using a technology
3942000	3944000	That's gonna be able to
3944000	3946000	You're using
3946000	3948000	A technology that your system can accommodate
3948000	3950000	To kind of use those
3950000	3952000	Big games and I think that's a
3952000	3954000	Really brilliant idea on their part
3954000	3956000	Yeah and then of course
3956000	3958000	I think we may have mentioned this last week
3958000	3960000	That they're getting the prequel to
3960000	3962000	The human element
3962000	3964000	Is gonna be an exclusive thing on there
3964000	3966000	Considering that that game doesn't come out in 2015
3966000	3968000	I don't even know how
3968000	3970000	Why would you even announce a game that's gonna come out that far
3970000	3972000	From now I mean
3974000	3976000	Cool you got a game coming out in 2015
3976000	3978000	I won't remember by the time I get to 2015
3978000	3980000	Tigerclaw in our chatroom
3980000	3982000	At live.vognetwork.com
3982000	3984000	Who earlier told me they were
3984000	3986000	Feeling ignored because of all the
3986000	3988000	Attention I'm giving the Playstation home tonight
3988000	3990000	I'd love you guys too
3990000	3992000	At the regular chatroom live.vognetwork.com
3992000	3994000	Tigerclaw says
3994000	3996000	On live is on Android
3996000	3998000	So it coming to Ouya was a no brainer
3998000	4000000	Well if you said that last week
4000000	4002000	Tigerclaw you would really look like a
4002000	4004000	Games analyst but now
4004000	4006000	I mean
4006000	4008000	I'm not surprised because even if
4008000	4010000	It wasn't on there they could have easily
4010000	4012000	Just you know side loaded it
4012000	4014000	On there and game guru reminds us
4014000	4016000	On live already has
4016000	4018000	A set top box you know so it's
4018000	4020000	Already available out there
4020000	4022000	True I think their set top box is like 50 bucks
4022000	4024000	Too but at least
4024000	4026000	This you'll get a set top box that'll
4026000	4028000	Do that and other
4028000	4030000	Things it'd be cool
4030000	4032000	If it's compatible with the on live controllers
4032000	4034000	I'm hoping that it's going to be compatible
4034000	4036000	With any bluetooth controller because then
4036000	4038000	I can use my PS3 controller
4038000	4040000	Which isn't getting a whole ton of use right now
4040000	4042000	Except for
4042000	4044000	You know browsing porn
4044000	4046000	On the PS3
4046000	4048000	What else do we use
4048000	4050000	Our devices for alright
4050000	4052000	Before I get into the next story I have some
4052000	4054000	I'm sorry home this is
4054000	4056000	These comments are a little bit delayed
4056000	4058000	But I think you can tell what segment of the show
4058000	4060000	These comments are from
4060000	4062000	PSV J style
4062000	4064000	In the Playstation home
4064000	4066000	Chat room Aurora 1.5 space
4066000	4068000	Tonight during summer fest says
4068000	4070000	Are you listening to this
4070000	4072000	LOL and
4072000	4074000	Fizz Liz says giggle time
4074000	4076000	So apparently
4076000	4078000	Now it's the running man and giggle fits
4078000	4080000	In Playstation home summer fest
4080000	4082000	Awesome
4082000	4084000	Are you going to do the Carlton next?
4084000	4086000	I don't think the Carlton is one of the
4086000	4088000	Dances it might be
4088000	4090000	You know what's great
4090000	4092000	Tangent time you ready for a
4092000	4094000	Random rob tangent
4094000	4096000	They upgraded the lotus notes system
4096000	4098000	At my work yes my work is one of the few
4098000	4100000	That uses lotus notes as opposed to
4100000	4102000	Outlook the other one right
4102000	4104000	So we use lotus notes and one of the huge new
4104000	4106000	Features is
4106000	4108000	Customizable emote icons
4108000	4110000	So now when you do the
4110000	4112000	Instant message you can have like your own emote icons
4112000	4114000	And one of the most popular ones right
4114000	4116000	Now that has been passed around
4116000	4118000	At the work place that we send to each other
4118000	4120000	Is the Carlton gift
4120000	4122000	When something goes well
4124000	4126000	You can add any animated gift
4126000	4128000	To the emote icon system which is amazing
4128000	4130000	Please tell me you added the table flipping or something
4130000	4132000	I don't have a table flipping
4132000	4134000	But I have a cat jumping out a window
4134000	4136000	It looks
4136000	4138000	It's a safe cat don't worry
4138000	4140000	It looks like a great distance but it's not
4140000	4142000	It's just like jumping into the backyard or something
4142000	4144000	But it's funny
4144000	4146000	Some things
4146000	4148000	Coming to
4148000	4150000	I feel bad that on the Sony Playstation home night
4150000	4152000	We have all this Microsoft news but
4152000	4154000	We do have some Sony news coming up a little later
4154000	4156000	But
4156000	4158000	This is an interesting experience on the Xbox
4158000	4160000	360
4160000	4162000	There's some new TV experiences
4162000	4164000	Coming later this year
4164000	4166000	They are Connect Sesame Street
4166000	4168000	TV not to be confused
4168000	4170000	With the game that already came out
4170000	4172000	And Connect National Geographic
4172000	4174000	TV which I think they're just calling
4174000	4176000	Nat Geo because I guess that's what the hip kids call it
4176000	4178000	Nat Geo
4178000	4180000	Alright
4180000	4182000	They will be $29.99
4182000	4184000	That's 2400 Microsoft
4184000	4186000	Points for 8
4186000	4188000	30 minute episodes
4188000	4190000	Apparently they are interactive
4190000	4192000	TV shows though
4192000	4194000	They will be available at retail
4194000	4196000	And Xbox Live under the
4196000	4198000	Season Pass
4198000	4200000	I don't know how the interactive
4200000	4202000	Episode works but I imagine maybe you will like
4202000	4204000	Sesame Street like they count along
4204000	4206000	You interact with Connect stuff
4206000	4208000	Like Elmo will tell you
4208000	4210000	Hey toss me my
4210000	4212000	Teddy bear and you make the motion like you're tossing
4212000	4214000	The teddy bear and if you don't it will
4214000	4216000	Still play on as well
4216000	4218000	It's like optional
4218000	4220000	I gotta say if I had kids that
4220000	4222000	Does sound pretty rad
4222000	4224000	Have you thought about something like this for Josh?
4224000	4226000	I've definitely thought about it
4226000	4228000	I may pick it up
4228000	4230000	How does Nat Geo work?
4230000	4232000	You point to
4232000	4234000	I want to see the topless natives point
4234000	4236000	I think it's animals
4236000	4238000	Not topless natives
4238000	4240000	It's more like
4240000	4242000	Can you spot the
4242000	4244000	Giraffe or something like that
4244000	4246000	Given a thing you have to find
4246000	4248000	I found it right there
4248000	4250000	Trivia and stuff like that
4250000	4252000	The other thing too is those are also
4252000	4254000	Rentable
4254000	4256000	I was going to get to that
4256000	4258000	For five bucks
4258000	4260000	That's 400 Microsoft points
4260000	4262000	September 18th is when this all starts
4262000	4264000	That's the purchase
4264000	4266000	Renting them is 240 Microsoft points
4266000	4268000	Each
4268000	4270000	That might be worth checking out
4270000	4272000	You should definitely put Josh
4272000	4274000	To the test there and see if it happens
4274000	4276000	It's hard to say
4276000	4278000	He probably won't know what to do
4278000	4280000	He's still a little young
4280000	4282000	If they tell him jump up and down
4282000	4284000	Sing a song
4284000	4286000	Sit there and eat a cracker
4286000	4288000	He's like no
4288000	4290000	I'm not going to do that
4290000	4292000	Skullking in
4292000	4294000	PlayStation Home says
4294000	4296000	Will this Sesame Street game be like Dora the
4296000	4298000	Explorer? If so I'm down
4298000	4300000	That's kind of how
4300000	4302000	That show works
4302000	4304000	A little bit
4304000	4306000	But it's for real
4306000	4308000	Maybe that will be the next thing that comes to connect
4308000	4310000	If these do well
4310000	4312000	It's all about how well these do
4312000	4314000	As iconic as it is
4314000	4316000	I imagine it's got to be pretty cheap
4316000	4318000	To reduce
4318000	4320000	Since this is all PBS programming
4320000	4322000	Fuck Dora the Explorer
4322000	4324000	She's on Nickelodeon
4324000	4326000	You know what it's all about?
4326000	4328000	Fucking Carmen Sandiego
4328000	4330000	Ghost writer on there
4330000	4332000	No
4332000	4334000	No
4334000	4336000	Reading Rainbow
4336000	4338000	I want LeVar Burton
4338000	4340000	To read to me on my
4340000	4342000	360 and that sexy sexy voice
4346000	4348000	Ah PBS
4348000	4350000	Mr. Rogers neighborhood
4350000	4352000	I know Mr. Rogers is long gone
4352000	4354000	Maybe a live interaction with King Friday
4354000	4356000	And what was that lady's
4356000	4358000	name? She was kind of a bitch
4358000	4360000	The lady that had the
4360000	4362000	museum or something, the carousel
4362000	4364000	Yeah you lost me
4364000	4366000	Somebody with me here, come on
4366000	4368000	That's Sharon Lewis and Bram's elephant show
4368000	4370000	We were listening to the theme song
4370000	4372000	yesterday
4372000	4374000	Two elephants went out to
4374000	4376000	play upon a
4376000	4378000	spider's web one day
4378000	4380000	And
4380000	4382000	where the hell is my god damn
4382000	4384000	Bob Ross painting game that I was promised
4384000	4386000	at the launch of the Wii
4386000	4388000	Huh? Please tell me you heard that new
4388000	4390000	Bob Ross remix Yeah it was alright
4390000	4392000	It's nice
4392000	4394000	Alright
4394000	4396000	Lady Elaine, thank you DJ Morpheus
4396000	4398000	I knew somebody in chat
4398000	4400000	would know it Lady Jane
4400000	4402000	Frisbee gives the full name
4402000	4404000	Lady Elaine Fairchild
4404000	4406000	That was it Lady Fairchild
4406000	4408000	She was
4408000	4410000	kind of a bitch
4412000	4414000	What do you want?
4414000	4416000	In the land of make believe
4416000	4418000	I would give a fuck
4418000	4420000	Make believe I'm gonna kick your ass
4420000	4424000	I made believe you weren't talking to me
4426000	4428000	Hold on sorry dead air but I'm trying to look
4428000	4430000	up right now on
4430000	4432000	the YouTubes
4432000	4434000	If I can get a clip here
4434000	4436000	Oh fuck yes here we go
4438000	4440000	Oh damn it that's like a song or something
4440000	4442000	That's a creepy puppet is what that is
4442000	4444000	It had a picture on it but
4444000	4446000	Is she a creepy puppet?
4446000	4448000	She was a creepy puppet
4448000	4450000	Alright forget it
4450000	4452000	Although maybe if that pop song is any good
4452000	4454000	I can put that in a vog network rotation
4454000	4456000	Anyhow let's move on with some more stories
4456000	4458000	Dark Sakura
4458000	4460000	Well how
4460000	4462000	about a survival
4462000	4464000	game called Pulse
4464000	4466000	It's free and it was put out
4466000	4468000	by the Vancouver film school
4468000	4470000	Well because you know students
4470000	4472000	student work has often played
4472000	4474000	into many a modern video
4474000	4476000	game like
4476000	4478000	Portal
4478000	4480000	You know
4480000	4482000	Anyway this game called Pulse
4482000	4484000	is a first person survival suspense
4484000	4486000	game so you play as a blind
4486000	4488000	girl who has to go through
4488000	4490000	a cave by throwing around
4490000	4492000	four sprites
4492000	4494000	Splat!
4494000	4496000	Splat!
4496000	4498000	And the sounds
4498000	4500000	they make help her see the world
4500000	4502000	around her kind of you know daredevil like
4502000	4504000	So she has sonar
4504000	4506000	She has sonar by throwing fairies into the wall
4506000	4508000	I like that
4508000	4510000	And it's done by Pixel
4510000	4512000	Pie Team and it's
4512000	4514000	very artsy, colorful
4514000	4516000	cartoony
4516000	4518000	but it's very very grim
4518000	4520000	and actually
4520000	4522000	they want to
4522000	4524000	expand it beyond the free version
4524000	4526000	but for now I think
4526000	4528000	if you want to get it you can go to their
4528000	4530000	official site
4530000	4532000	which is Team Pixel Pie
4532000	4534000	as in 3.14
4534000	4536000	.com
4536000	4538000	I'm going to get it when I get home
4538000	4540000	Very cool, I'm glad these students
4540000	4542000	had time to produce this you know
4542000	4544000	And the site is really pretty
4544000	4546000	I love the color scheme in this
4546000	4548000	It really is just very
4548000	4550000	different
4550000	4552000	Well congrats to the folks at the very original school
4552000	4554000	Well there's another one too
4554000	4556000	There's one called the Mask of Key QI
4556000	4558000	which is a third person platformer
4558000	4560000	that has a master flying squirrel
4560000	4562000	and it's done by
4562000	4564000	Team Kronk and it's another
4564000	4566000	freebie
4566000	4568000	Alright let's travel around the world
4568000	4570000	and check out release dates of some more
4570000	4572000	traditional retail games coming to a store
4572000	4574000	near you this week. Loki?
4574000	4576000	Not a lot of big things but
4576000	4578000	a couple big games that you'll probably be interested in
4578000	4580000	starting off with Risen 2
4580000	4582000	Dark Waters on Playstation 3
4582000	4584000	Xbox 360
4584000	4586000	and I believe PC
4586000	4588000	and then for 3DS owners
4588000	4590000	finally getting your copy of
4590000	4592000	Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance
4592000	4594000	in 3D
4594000	4596000	on 3DS
4596000	4598000	You don't say? Yes I do say
4598000	4600000	and
4600000	4602000	I think that's pretty much it
4602000	4604000	I mean at least those are the big ones this week
4604000	4606000	Well the Kingdom Hearts game is kind of a big deal
4606000	4608000	so that's cool
4608000	4610000	Yeah that'd be it
4610000	4612000	Let's travel- Oh Grow Lancers
4612000	4614000	Grow Lancers way far over time
4614000	4616000	Forgot the Atlas PSP title
4616000	4618000	Alright moving to Japan
4618000	4620000	and checking out the release dates over there
4620000	4622000	The Idolmaster 2 gets a price
4622000	4624000	reduction this week on the Xbox 360
4624000	4626000	That's not a new release but
4626000	4628000	if you like to save money that will be going
4628000	4630000	into effect this week. On the Playstation 3
4630000	4632000	things are a little more exciting
4632000	4634000	when you have Tales of Vesperia also
4634000	4636000	getting a price reduction and
4636000	4638000	Tales of Graces F also
4638000	4640000	getting a price reduction and
4640000	4642000	Troy Musu getting a
4642000	4644000	price reduction as well as Idolmaster
4644000	4646000	2. There's lots of price reductions. Oh
4646000	4648000	Battlefield Bad Company 2
4648000	4650000	It's like a Playstation 3 sale but
4650000	4652000	sadly no new games to report on either of those
4652000	4654000	systems this week in Japan
4654000	4656000	Looking at the Playstation Vita
4656000	4658000	there is a game called Momo
4658000	4660000	Daisensu Gen Daiban
4660000	4662000	comes out this week in a regular
4662000	4664000	and premium edition that's a game on
4664000	4666000	the Vita. I don't know if that's
4666000	4668000	based off an anime or what
4668000	4670000	but it's from SystemSoft and
4670000	4672000	it kind of looks like these
4672000	4674000	I don't know, one chick kind of looks like an army girl
4674000	4676000	and another kind of looks like Sailor Moon-ish
4676000	4678000	but she's got like a microphone
4678000	4680000	so I'm not sure what this game is all about
4680000	4682000	there is no description
4682000	4684000	about if it's based off a series
4684000	4686000	or what have you. I have to randomly add
4686000	4688000	that Chris always compliments your Japanese
4688000	4690000	pronunciation. He's always
4690000	4692000	impressed by it. Don't listen to early
4692000	4694000	episodes of the show because it was a hot
4694000	4696000	mess. Never had a class
4696000	4698000	Well I did have Jamie sitting over here
4698000	4700000	to slap me on the back of the head when I'd get one wrong
4700000	4702000	I can't do it right now. You put the embosses
4702000	4704000	in the wrong syllable
4706000	4708000	On the 3DS this
4708000	4710000	week, more exciting
4710000	4712000	games like Smile Pre-Cure
4712000	4714000	Let's Go Marching World
4714000	4716000	that's what it's called. Madagascar 3
4716000	4718000	and Wan Nyan
4718000	4720000	Dobutsu Buyan 2
4720000	4722000	Sorry that's not a Nyan
4722000	4724000	cat game, it just happens to have that in the name
4724000	4726000	but there is a cat and a dog in it
4726000	4728000	I think it's like a pet dog
4728000	4730000	Wan Nyan
4730000	4732000	Midnight Maximum Tune
4732000	4734000	or something like that
4734000	4736000	A crazy drift racing
4736000	4738000	Nyan cat
4738000	4740000	Starring Tunes is the driving cat
4740000	4742000	This actually looks
4742000	4744000	super cute. It looks like a pet
4744000	4746000	hospital kind of game because the front cover
4746000	4748000	has all this guy
4748000	4750000	and ladies in lab long white
4750000	4752000	coats that you'd see veterinarians wear
4752000	4754000	and it's all kitties and puppies
4754000	4756000	and that guy in the back
4756000	4758000	Oh my god this is perfect
4758000	4760000	Shane if you're listening you need to see this
4760000	4762000	Dude in the back with blue hair holding a corgi
4762000	4764000	That's like
4764000	4766000	It's Shane personified right there
4766000	4768000	I'm going to send him a link to this in case he's listening
4768000	4770000	Alright
4770000	4772000	Moving on
4772000	4774000	I'm sorry I'm busy calibrating
4774000	4776000	Who are you? Garris?
4776000	4778000	Let's do UK releases
4778000	4780000	Okay well in the UK
4780000	4782000	I'm going to have to reload the page but on the 30th
4782000	4784000	we have Orcs Must Die
4784000	4786000	and now I have to go back
4786000	4788000	to the top of the page and load it next month
4788000	4790000	So
4790000	4792000	They freaking changed how
4792000	4794000	their things work so whatever
4794000	4796000	Um
4796000	4798000	Where's fucking August
4798000	4800000	Fuck. Okay August
4800000	4802000	I can't help it
4802000	4804000	Stop judging me
4804000	4806000	Okay on August 1st
4806000	4808000	Deadlight and Puddle
4808000	4810000	On August 3rd Risen 2
4810000	4812000	Dark Waters and then that's all and if there's anything else
4812000	4814000	I don't care
4814000	4816000	Sorry
4816000	4818000	folks overseas but Dark Soccer doesn't
4818000	4820000	care. No that's all that
4820000	4822000	Eurogamer told me there was
4822000	4824000	Alright a couple more news stories
4824000	4826000	I couldn't be bothered
4826000	4828000	A couple more news stories for you guys and then
4828000	4830000	the classic game of the week we're going to take a trip down
4830000	4832000	memory lane and revisit a game from the past
4832000	4834000	that you should check out
4834000	4836000	because Dark Soccer told you to
4836000	4838000	but first a couple more news stories
4838000	4840000	In this case because Dan told me to tell you to
4840000	4842000	Okay. Alright so apparently GameStop
4842000	4844000	CEO Paul Rains
4844000	4846000	He made a comment regarding
4846000	4848000	the possibility of a used
4848000	4850000	digital
4850000	4852000	downloads
4852000	4854000	format. Basically
4854000	4856000	the whole
4856000	4858000	lawsuit that happened in the UK
4858000	4860000	kind of set an interest
4860000	4862000	well it didn't really set a precedent but it was interesting
4862000	4864000	that they kind of favored
4864000	4866000	towards that that you should be able to get
4866000	4868000	refunds for used games
4868000	4870000	when you're done using them
4870000	4872000	Basically calling and saying
4872000	4874000	interesting. It's not a
4874000	4876000	meaningful business yet
4876000	4878000	Right now we're not seeing
4878000	4880000	that as a huge market but I think
4880000	4882000	we're on the leading edge. There are a few companies
4882000	4884000	a few startups out there that we
4884000	4886000	talked to that are doing this
4886000	4888000	and of course they just purchased
4888000	4890000	Impulse which is
4890000	4892000	originally from Stardock
4892000	4894000	and they kind of have a similar service
4894000	4896000	on there where you can
4896000	4898000	use it as
4898000	4900000	goo to create used
4900000	4902000	PC licenses for different
4902000	4904000	games
4904000	4906000	and they say no we don't see
4906000	4908000	a lot of interest in the model from our publishing
4908000	4910000	partners
4910000	4912000	but definitely something
4912000	4914000	that they're interested in looking at when
4914000	4916000	that time comes. I guess it makes sense
4916000	4918000	if everything is going to go digital and stuff
4918000	4920000	and they do eventually have a
4920000	4922000	way to revoke licenses which would be
4922000	4924000	pretty cool. I mean especially some of the
4924000	4926000	stuff I have on like steam
4926000	4928000	and stuff if I could sell some of the
4928000	4930000	things that you know I'm not playing
4930000	4932000	and I got in some of these indie bundles that would be
4932000	4934000	kind of cool
4934000	4936000	to trade it in for
4936000	4938000	other things
4938000	4940000	but of course you know if it
4940000	4942000	has anything to do with used game sales they're probably
4942000	4944000	all over it. Do you think this could
4944000	4946000	work? It could work but
4946000	4948000	it involves all the
4948000	4950000	publishers having to agree on that kind of thing and that's
4950000	4952000	kind of basically green to
4952000	4954000	having a used marketplace and isn't
4954000	4956000	that what they're kind of trying to get rid of already
4956000	4958000	so that's
4958000	4960000	I don't think that this is ever
4960000	4962000	going to
4962000	4964000	hit full force
4964000	4966000	anytime soon. There's a part
4966000	4968000	of me that thinks a system like
4968000	4970000	this is just begging to be hacked
4970000	4972000	like I kind of
4972000	4974000	think they might try to implement well then again
4974000	4976000	I don't know steam works alright like
4976000	4978000	they haven't been able to hack steam right
4978000	4980000	but I don't know something like this
4980000	4982000	just seems like
4982000	4984000	it's begging to be worked around
4984000	4986000	there's ways to hack game not that I'm saying
4986000	4988000	you should do it but it definitely is one of the
4988000	4990000	things that's got to be giving publishers pause
4992000	4994000	I just think a lot of these systems are
4994000	4996000	going to be closed and then the
4996000	4998000	other thing too is like say I
4998000	5000000	have a PS3 game or something like that and I want
5000000	5002000	to trade my digital copy in for something
5002000	5004000	what if I want to get a 360 game with that
5004000	5006000	or am I going to be able to do that? The system is going to be
5006000	5008000	separate and you have different rules I mean there's a whole
5008000	5010000	lot of things going in
5010000	5012000	going on there and it's just
5012000	5014000	that's probably why this isn't
5014000	5016000	they're trying to get rid of used game sales they're not
5016000	5018000	going to try to all of a sudden say hey
5018000	5020000	yeah we're going to go digital but we're
5020000	5022000	bringing used games back that's not going to happen
5022000	5024000	I mean come on they're doing this to get people
5024000	5026000	to buy new games in the first place
5026000	5028000	they're not going to all of a sudden
5028000	5030000	flip a 180 and just say hey
5030000	5032000	by the way used games are awesome
5032000	5034000	no it's not going to happen
5034000	5036000	alright one more story for you guys here
5036000	5038000	before the classic game of the week and it has to do
5038000	5040000	with Final Fantasy 14
5040000	5042000	yes we do want to do a little
5042000	5044000	reporting on Final Fantasy 14 because
5044000	5046000	you know very interesting
5046000	5048000	MMO this is a I mean
5048000	5050000	it wasn't that great when it came out
5050000	5052000	let's be real if you played it on PC especially
5052000	5054000	when it first came out it was a really
5054000	5056000	crap game there have been
5056000	5058000	improvements since it first launched
5058000	5060000	and they're promising even more before
5060000	5062000	the big launch on Playstation 3
5062000	5064000	later this year well they now
5064000	5066000	are officially calling it
5066000	5068000	Final Fantasy 14
5068000	5070000	A Realm Reborn that is
5070000	5072000	the version 2.0 of the game
5072000	5074000	that's going to be coming out later this year
5074000	5076000	I don't think it's coming out later this year
5076000	5078000	oh really? yeah
5078000	5080000	I have a TBA 2013
5080000	5082000	date right now for it really
5082000	5084000	well they did put out a trailer
5084000	5086000	this week I haven't even watched this
5086000	5088000	trailer yet but I'm told there's no
5088000	5090000	gameplay in it it's just CGI
5090000	5092000	really Final Fantasy trailer no gameplay
5092000	5094000	in it I know right but color me shocked
5094000	5096000	apparently a lot of this has to do
5096000	5098000	with like
5098000	5100000	it's basically Final Fantasy
5100000	5102000	14 Cataclysm to put
5102000	5104000	I mean look you can see we're watching
5104000	5106000	the trailer here and you can probably hear a little bit of the audio
5106000	5108000	coming through the feed but we're
5108000	5110000	looking at you know missiles flying from the
5110000	5112000	sky and basically destroying
5112000	5114000	things you see all these like warriors
5114000	5116000	suiting up and putting up shields but it's
5116000	5118000	very obvious the world is being hit
5118000	5120000	so that tells me that's their
5120000	5122000	you know just like they did in World of Warcraft
5122000	5124000	that's their way to
5124000	5126000	change the look of the world and so
5126000	5128000	forth but I gotta say you know
5128000	5130000	the CGI heavy or not
5130000	5132000	it looks great
5132000	5134000	of course the original trailer for 14 looked
5134000	5136000	awesome I remember that original
5136000	5138000	trailer at E3 gave me chills
5138000	5140000	just because I spent so many years with
5140000	5142000	Final Fantasy 11 I was like legit that
5142000	5144000	excited and then when I played the game
5144000	5146000	I had different type of chills so cold
5146000	5148000	so cold it's so bad
5148000	5150000	why is this allowed to be released
5150000	5152000	he touched me in a dirty place
5152000	5154000	but see that looks pretty rad doesn't it
5154000	5156000	I don't know
5156000	5158000	I'm just looking here at the end I'm trying to see if there's actually a date
5158000	5160000	nope coming soon
5160000	5162000	I don't have a date coming soon to PlayStation 3
5162000	5164000	and PC December 31st
5164000	5166000	2013 is what the placeholder
5166000	5168000	date is right now which means
5168000	5170000	TVA 2013
5170000	5172000	if it's TVA 2012 then yeah maybe later this year
5172000	5174000	Akuma JP
5174000	5176000	says Meteo maybe
5176000	5178000	that's a reference to what you might be seeing
5178000	5180000	there in the trailer very interesting thought
5180000	5182000	Monty Boggs says Final Fantasy
5182000	5184000	the new 52
5184000	5186000	in parentheses online players
5186000	5188000	via PlayStation 3
5188000	5190000	I see what you did there
5190000	5192000	yeah Akuma JP is putting it
5192000	5194000	together saying there's a red meteor in the sky
5194000	5196000	so he thinks it's gonna involve Meteo
5196000	5198000	I gotta say
5198000	5200000	Final Fantasy 14 at least the look of it
5200000	5202000	fits in very well with the series
5202000	5204000	it's just kinda you know
5204000	5206000	the game was kinda crap
5206000	5208000	Final Fantasy 11
5208000	5210000	a game report into Final Fantasy
5210000	5212000	version 2
5212000	5214000	alright look let's take a step
5214000	5216000	back to a time when games are a lot more simple
5218000	5220000	they weren't so flashy
5220000	5222000	there was no CGI trailer for this game
5222000	5224000	we're about to talk about and if there had been
5224000	5226000	it would have been all kinds of awesome
5226000	5228000	Dark Sakura
5228000	5230000	is gonna step into the vault as she always
5230000	5232000	does and she'll go
5232000	5234000	this is crunchy
5234000	5236000	and this will say Dan
5236000	5238000	game
5238000	5240000	and get a classic game of the week
5240000	5242000	suggestion Dark Sakura what is this
5242000	5244000	classic game of the week? Roadblasters
5244000	5246000	good pick
5246000	5248000	yeah I know
5248000	5250000	it's an arcade game that came out by Atari
5250000	5252000	games in 1987
5252000	5254000	when I was still in
5254000	5256000	middle school
5256000	5258000	basically
5258000	5260000	it is a game where you drive
5260000	5262000	a sports car through 50 different
5262000	5264000	rally races and you have to get to the end
5264000	5266000	without running out of fuel
5266000	5268000	so you have to complete all 50 of those
5268000	5270000	races
5270000	5272000	you can basically have as many vehicles
5272000	5274000	as you want to complete the rally
5274000	5276000	but you have to have gas
5276000	5278000	in the arcade
5278000	5280000	the Sega
5280000	5282000	and the Lynx version
5282000	5284000	you could start the game
5284000	5286000	at a higher rally and get more
5286000	5288000	opportunities to jump levels
5288000	5290000	and you can continue the game from where
5290000	5292000	you left off but you only have
5292000	5294000	one chance to complete the 50th and
5294000	5296000	final rally
5296000	5298000	so you have four ways that you can get in this game
5298000	5300000	by green globes, red globes, a checkpoint
5300000	5302000	and the rally point
5302000	5304000	green globes are on the road and they fill
5304000	5306000	your main tank, red globes
5306000	5308000	are getting by shooting enemies
5308000	5310000	on the road and after
5310000	5312000	you complete the rally you get an extra
5312000	5314000	fuel reserve depending on how many
5314000	5316000	enemies you destroyed
5316000	5318000	so you get fuel by blowing shit up
5320000	5322000	each consecutive kill shot increases
5322000	5324000	your multiplier one up to ten
5324000	5326000	and this lowers your multiplier by one
5326000	5328000	so whatever your multiplier
5328000	5330000	is that when you cross the line
5330000	5332000	you get
5332000	5334000	that much fuel
5334000	5336000	so
5336000	5338000	excuse me, I just finished my coffee
5338000	5340000	wow girl, shut up
5340000	5342000	it's your coffee
5342000	5344000	like I said you have
5344000	5346000	a checkpoint, a midway point
5346000	5348000	where
5348000	5350000	when you cross that line you actually get
5350000	5352000	the amount of fuel in the main tank restored
5352000	5354000	to what it was at the beginning of the rally
5354000	5356000	but your reserve
5356000	5358000	tank is not restored so it's just basically
5358000	5360000	like you get a quick
5360000	5362000	fill up, quick fill up
5362000	5364000	so you've got different cars in there, you have the stingers
5364000	5366000	which are orange, command cars
5366000	5368000	which are purple, they have bulletproof bumpers
5368000	5370000	and must be killed by a cruise missile
5370000	5372000	or an electro shield, you have cycles
5372000	5374000	rat jeeps, they come in from the left
5374000	5376000	stop it and swerve to the right, so basically
5376000	5378000	they're like knights in chess
5378000	5380000	gun turrets, you have mines
5380000	5382000	on the road, you cannot destroy
5382000	5384000	them but you get alarms that let you
5384000	5386000	know where they are, and toxic
5386000	5388000	spills, you get special weapons
5388000	5390000	you get the UZ cannon
5390000	5392000	it's a rapid fire gun that does not
5392000	5394000	deplete your multiplier
5394000	5396000	but they have limited ammo, you have a cruise
5396000	5398000	missile which kaboom you get three missiles
5398000	5400000	a nitro inject
5400000	5402000	which increases your speed from 210
5402000	5404000	to 298
5404000	5406000	kilometers per hour
5406000	5408000	electro shield
5408000	5410000	which lets you drive through the enemy
5410000	5412000	unharmed for a short distance and you get three
5412000	5414000	to a pack
5414000	5416000	they wanted
5416000	5418000	though, now this is a little bit of
5418000	5420000	information about the production which actually this little bit
5420000	5422000	I did not know
5422000	5424000	the creators wanted to have an electronic
5424000	5426000	version of Mr. Sandman
5426000	5428000	to play on one of the levels
5428000	5430000	but they never put it in
5430000	5432000	that's kind of weird
5432000	5434000	no, this is weird
5434000	5436000	it had a promo with the original arcade game
5436000	5438000	where you can send in your score when all 50 levels
5438000	5440000	are completed to get a free road
5440000	5442000	blasters t-shirt
5442000	5444000	it had a toy tie-in by Matchbox
5444000	5446000	so you get die-cast cars
5446000	5448000	that can be customized with armor
5448000	5450000	lasers, machine guns, rocket launchers
5450000	5452000	and jet engines, there were the
5452000	5454000	turbo force and the motor boards
5454000	5456000	during the gameplay you would get
5456000	5458000	a slightly robotic sounding female voice
5458000	5460000	that gives you advice
5460000	5462000	and it has different phrases
5462000	5464000	including hit it and eat
5464000	5466000	lead road hog
5466000	5468000	and when you use your nitro inject
5468000	5470000	you get, now that's cruising
5472000	5474000	a guy with a last name that I can't pronounce
5474000	5476000	I'm guessing it's a Polish name
5476000	5478000	Stan Szczepanski
5478000	5480000	holds the
5480000	5482000	official Guinness World Record
5482000	5484000	for roadblaster
5484000	5486000	at 2,216,120 points
5486000	5488000	if you beat this
5488000	5490000	we'll give you some air
5490000	5492000	and that's it, roadblasters
5492000	5494000	alright

5496000	5498000	many bowling alley trips to play
5498000	5500000	roadblasters, among other things

5652000	5654000	what about bubbling somebody
5654000	5656000	isn't it? I don't know
5656000	5658000	is it what the floor was doing?
5658000	5660000	no, the floor makes those pretty effects
5660000	5662000	alright, I'm being told to pick a number
5662000	5664000	between 1 and 100
5664000	5666000	and say it on the air for another
5666000	5668000	Blender giveaway, he was awesome enough
5668000	5670000	to give something away during
5670000	5672000	R
5672000	5674000	the letter R will not work
5674000	5676000	he was awesome enough to give something away during the Bobby Black Wolf show
5676000	5678000	and he's giving something away now, who knows what it could be
5678000	5680000	but I will let the lovely Marissa
5680000	5682000	she's here tonight, pick that number between
5682000	5684000	1 and 100, Marissa what's it going to be?
5684000	5686000	3
5686000	5688000	3, she's low balling it
5688000	5690000	alright, 1 and 100
5690000	5692000	please don't make any references to balls with me after the first one
5692000	5694000	3
5694000	5696000	balls Marissa?
5696000	5698000	Marissa, 3 balls?
5698000	5700000	really?
5700000	5702000	alright, 3 it is, that's the magic number
5702000	5704000	good luck, hope it's you
5704000	5706000	I don't know what that's
5706000	5708000	going to pick, but Blender will let us know
5708000	5710000	alright, meanwhile
5710000	5712000	we're going to get back
5712000	5714000	into some rapid fire news
5714000	5716000	and some quick news stories
5716000	5718000	and then the FUGL question of the week
5718000	5720000	and I'll explain that for those that are new to the show
5720000	5722000	I do want to once again welcome any new
5722000	5724000	listeners who you might have this week because of Summerfest
5724000	5726000	or whatever, if you don't know Orange Lounge
5726000	5728000	Radio, we've been around for 10 years, believe it or not
5728000	5730000	we started the show back in
5730000	5732000	2002, in June
5732000	5734000	of 2002, it was back
5734000	5736000	then, a show we created
5736000	5738000	in support of the
5738000	5740000	music gaming community
5740000	5742000	especially games like Dance Dance Revolution
5742000	5744000	Beatmania, Bust a Move
5744000	5746000	or Bust a Groove, depending on what country you're from
5746000	5748000	that whole series
5748000	5750000	everything music game related
5750000	5752000	especially DDR was the big arcade game
5752000	5754000	Dark Soccer, Loki and myself
5754000	5756000	all met playing DDR, if you can believe it
5756000	5758000	at a place called Golfland
5758000	5760000	or, you know, sometimes we'd
5760000	5762000	go to the bowling alley, or we'd drive all the way
5762000	5764000	to Stockton, Loki, remember
5764000	5766000	we'd drive all the way to Stockton Golfland
5766000	5768000	to play DDR Fifth Mix when they had that
5768000	5770000	but as the years went on
5770000	5772000	we decided, you know what, yes we love DDR
5772000	5774000	but we love all video games as well
5774000	5776000	and our show became about all video games, especially
5776000	5778000	the community, because the style of our show
5778000	5780000	has always been
5780000	5782000	you know, we would do these arcade
5782000	5784000	nights where we play DDR, and then we'd go
5784000	5786000	to a restaurant called Brookfields
5786000	5788000	a local place here afterwards, and
5788000	5790000	just have dinner and talk shit about things we
5790000	5792000	liked and didn't like, and that's kind of
5792000	5794000	the atmosphere we bring to the show
5794000	5796000	is we literally sit around a big table
5796000	5798000	and talk some shit, but you guys get to
5798000	5800000	talk with us in the chat room
5800000	5802000	via Skype, via the mailbag
5802000	5804000	and all of that good stuff
5804000	5806000	and we really do care about what you guys have to say
5806000	5808000	and that's why we call it a show where every gamer
5808000	5810000	has a voice. Anyhow
5810000	5812000	alright, after that little reintroduction
5812000	5814000	just for the folks new to our show tonight
5814000	5816000	let's go to some rapid fire news
5816000	5818000	and talk some shit, Loki
5818000	5820000	I'm good at that, you know, talking
5820000	5822000	shit and stuff, so let's talk about
5822000	5824000	one of my games that I'm very

5872000	5874000	and then completely
5874000	5876000	off topic
5876000	5878000	I watched some video in 1080p
5878000	5880000	from our Activision rep for
5880000	5882000	Black Ops 2, I need that
5882000	5884000	game now
5884000	5886000	that is a sexy game
5886000	5888000	we went and saw, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week
5888000	5890000	because it's not really a game, but we finally went and saw Batman
5890000	5892000	on Tuesday, and they played a
5892000	5894000	trailer for that, they played
5894000	5896000	a video game trailer before the movie, which I thought was
5896000	5898000	interesting, it wasn't like a
5898000	5900000	you know how movie theaters do this now
5900000	5902000	I'm sure every movie theater in America does this now
5902000	5904000	like you go to the movie and
5904000	5906000	before the trailer starts, there's just the
5906000	5908000	20 minutes of basically commercials
5908000	5910000	that they call like, what is it, First Look
5910000	5912000	or the 20 or something where it's just
5912000	5914000	it's just commercials
5914000	5916000	get here early and see our
5916000	5918000	ads, yeah you consumer whore
5918000	5920000	and they were
5920000	5922000	showing a trailer for that Modern Warfare 2
5922000	5924000	and Alan
5924000	5926000	leans over to me and goes, this looks bad
5926000	5928000	this doesn't look good, and I'm like
5928000	5930000	it's a shoot em game, honey, you wouldn't like it
5930000	5932000	it's a great game, he doesn't know what he's
5932000	5934000	talking about
5934000	5936000	no seriously, the new one's actually being
5936000	5938000	kind of ties in with Batman because it's being written
5938000	5940000	by the guy that did
5940000	5942000	yes, I was in the ads
5942000	5944000	it looks good, there's some new
5944000	5946000	stuff that they're adding
5946000	5948000	it'll be the first Modern Warfare game
5948000	5950000	that I'm actually going to get at launch
5950000	5952000	I'm finally caught up
5952000	5954000	except it's not really Modern Warfare
5954000	5956000	I mean it's Future Warfare
5956000	5958000	anyways, so let's talk a little bit about
5958000	5960000	arcade games, and I actually have
5960000	5962000	Double Fish on my arcade cabinet
5962000	5964000	I haven't really played a whole ton of it
5964000	5966000	but I have it emulated
5966000	5968000	and it was a game
5968000	5970000	that was on Sammy's
5970000	5972000	Autonomous Wave
5972000	5974000	Autonomous Wave arcade
5974000	5976000	hardware, they had a lot of other stuff like
5976000	5978000	Dolphin Blue and stuff
5978000	5980000	and it was a fighting game, it was pretty awesome
5980000	5982000	well, Dimps
5982000	5984000	the company behind it
5984000	5986000	I guess, picked up the rights to it and now
5986000	5988000	they're going to be re-releasing it on
5988000	5990000	consoles
5990000	5992000	not consoles, I'm sorry, arcades
5992000	5994000	and they're bringing Rumble Fish 2
5994000	5996000	to arcades
5996000	5998000	which was
5998000	6000000	in 2005, and now it's coming back
6000000	6002000	and I guess
6002000	6004000	it's on this new
6004000	6006000	Nesica Live
6006000	6008000	or Nesica Cross Live
6008000	6010000	it's a
6010000	6012000	not a streaming platform, but it's a
6012000	6014000	platform where arcade
6014000	6016000	owners
6016000	6018000	can actually download
6018000	6020000	games to cabinets
6020000	6022000	digital download of arcade games
6022000	6024000	I'm surprised
6024000	6026000	that's only just now becoming a thing
6026000	6028000	because that makes an awful lot of sense
6028000	6030000	I forgot a shoutout I wanted to do at Start A Part B
6030000	6032000	I'm so sorry, this is so important
6032000	6034000	I'm so pissed I didn't get to go this year
6034000	6036000	I mean, I just, juggling priorities
6036000	6038000	California Extreme
6038000	6040000	was this weekend, and I got
6040000	6042000	sent pictures and video
6042000	6044000	and apparently they had a full on
6044000	6046000	Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, I don't know if it was Chuck E. Cheese
6046000	6048000	but one of the likes, animatronic band
6048000	6050000	that would sit there and creepily play songs
6050000	6052000	cause I got sent a video of one
6052000	6054000	that's awesome, so I mean
6054000	6056000	you never really think of that cause there's a lot of Chuck E. Cheese's
6056000	6058000	that have closed down
6058000	6060000	or just upgraded and stuff
6060000	6062000	I hope I didn't get that wrong
6062000	6064000	but it's that style
6064000	6066000	I would love to have the old
6066000	6068000	Bullwinkles stuff
6068000	6070000	maybe that's what this is, I don't know, anyway
6070000	6072000	I'm gonna hand that to Marissa, hit play
6072000	6074000	so that Loki can see it too
6074000	6076000	that way you guys can kind of check that out
6076000	6078000	that's why it was sent from California Extreme
6078000	6080000	and they're singing
6080000	6082000	Total Eclipse of the Heart
6082000	6084000	that is pretty amazing
6084000	6086000	I was sent
6086000	6088000	Neil sent that there
6088000	6090000	I would just put that out in my front yard
6090000	6092000	all year round
6092000	6094000	he had a animatronic band
6094000	6096000	it's Halloween, put a fucking
6096000	6098000	pumpkin in front of them
6098000	6100000	it's Christmas, put
6100000	6102000	Santa hats on them
6102000	6104000	so shout out to California Extreme
6104000	6106000	I'm so sorry I couldn't make it this year
6106000	6108000	the shadow casting was this weekend too
6108000	6110000	it would only make that thing better
6110000	6112000	if they would fucking just
6112000	6114000	totally get some
6114000	6116000	brick rolling going on there
6116000	6118000	never gonna give you up
6118000	6120000	oh boy
6120000	6122000	anyway, so we're at
6122000	6124000	Rebel Fish
6124000	6126000	I think it's pretty cool that they have arcade hardware
6126000	6128000	you can download games for
6128000	6130000	if it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy some
6130000	6132000	arcade hardware I could download games to
6132000	6134000	well, I have arcade hardware I guess I could download games to
6134000	6136000	not entirely legally
6136000	6138000	but you know
6138000	6140000	still, that's a cool idea
6140000	6142000	I guess
6142000	6144000	alright
6144000	6146000	and then of course, this is kind of cool
6146000	6148000	I know a game that we kind of liked
6148000	6150000	a while back
6150000	6152000	Puzzle Quest, they put out a couple games
6152000	6154000	and kind of disappeared
6154000	6156000	but now Puzzle Quest is coming back
6156000	6158000	apparently this is kind of
6158000	6160000	because
6160000	6162000	Firemint, the company that
6162000	6164000	put out the game
6164000	6166000	I guess they
6166000	6168000	or they just
6168000	6170000	Firemint is now
6170000	6172000	putting out the game because they purchased
6172000	6174000	Infinite Interactive, which was the original creator of the game
6174000	6176000	and so now it's
6176000	6178000	coming back
6178000	6180000	Puzzle Quest 2 is pretty awesome, it was on like every system out there
6180000	6182000	and I'm not talking about the galactic one
6182000	6184000	that didn't do so well
6184000	6186000	but Puzzle Quest 2 is really good
6186000	6188000	Puzzle Quest is a pretty cool game
6188000	6190000	I wasn't a fan of the galactic one but
6190000	6192000	I would be, I'd be down for more
6192000	6194000	of the old Puzzle Quest
6194000	6196000	heck yeah
6196000	6198000	alright I got a few stories for you guys as well
6198000	6200000	or Puzzle Pirates, I'd be down for that too on consoles
6200000	6202000	Puzzle Pirates, Puzzle Pirates
6202000	6204000	you can do Puzzle Pirates on Steam
6204000	6206000	for what it's worth, it's free to play MMO right now
6206000	6208000	you didn't know that?
6208000	6210000	yeah, it's on Steam
6210000	6212000	yeah, but no one's playing it anymore
6212000	6214000	they will play it if you will play it Logie
6214000	6216000	we will be Puzzle Pirates together
6218000	6220000	alright, I got a couple stories for you guys here
6220000	6222000	first one is about
6222000	6224000	Super, or excuse me, New Super Mario
6224000	6226000	Brothers 2, did you know I had a
6226000	6228000	working title called New Super Mario
6228000	6230000	Brothers Gold, in fact that was
6230000	6232000	supposed to be the name, and you know they've kind of
6232000	6234000	been saying this a lot, this is, even at E3
6234000	6236000	when they were talking about it, what does Mario
6236000	6238000	love more than anything? Gold coins
6238000	6240000	and this new game's all about coins
6240000	6242000	well, apparently
6242000	6244000	it was about
6244000	6246000	excuse me, it was
6246000	6248000	it was so much a part of the game
6248000	6250000	that it was originally going to be
6250000	6252000	called New Super Mario
6252000	6254000	Brothers Gold, but
6254000	6256000	yeah, they went back and called it New Super Mario Brothers 2
6256000	6258000	but they were worried too many people would think it's just
6258000	6260000	you know, a cheapy, or a cheap
6260000	6262000	cash-in on the first one
6262000	6264000	of the first one, yeah, but hey, switching
6264000	6266000	out gold and putting two in there, that totally
6266000	6268000	you know, gets rid of the whole
6268000	6270000	thought that it's a cheap cash-in on the first one
6270000	6272000	it's now about, it's all about the coins
6272000	6274000	now, Loki
6274000	6276000	oh yeah, it's all about that, it's totally
6276000	6278000	different than the last game
6278000	6280000	alright, a
6280000	6282000	comment from Crytek is our next story
6282000	6284000	about the Wii U
6284000	6286000	you know, we've been getting more and more developers commenting
6286000	6288000	on this, producer Mike Reed
6288000	6290000	mentioned that
6290000	6292000	Crytek is talking about working with
6292000	6294000	Nintendo, a version of Crysis 3
6294000	6296000	for Wii U should not
6296000	6298000	be ruled out, he would not
6298000	6300000	confirm if it's in development
6300000	6302000	or not, but it's sounding pretty
6302000	6304000	likely, and here's a quote
6304000	6306000	from ComputerVideoGames.com
6306000	6308000	I wouldn't say there's no chance
6308000	6310000	I wouldn't say no chance, I mean the Wii U
6310000	6312000	still doesn't have any kind of release date
6312000	6314000	attached to it at this point, who knows what the
6314000	6316000	future will bring with it, I can definitely say
6316000	6318000	that we are working with Nintendo, and that's about all
6318000	6320000	I can say on that front, I wouldn't rule it
6320000	6322000	out, but there really has been no official releases
6322000	6324000	associated with the Wii U yet, and
6324000	6326000	given that we're releasing Crysis in an 8 month
6326000	6328000	time period in February of 2013
6328000	6330000	we can't play off of what their
6330000	6332000	schedules are, I wouldn't rule it out, but you know
6332000	6334000	it's a possibility.
6334000	6336000	I mean come on, their
6336000	6338000	hardware is pretty much
6338000	6340000	on par with the current consoles, it's
6340000	6342000	not that hard to port that over, I mean
6342000	6344000	they're porting other games over, so
6344000	6346000	yes, of course there's gonna be that
6346000	6348000	I think what the stipulation is
6348000	6350000	gonna be, you know, what's Nintendo require
6350000	6352000	from these people putting out stuff
6352000	6354000	for their platform, are they making them
6354000	6356000	hey, you gotta have some unique gameplay that
6356000	6358000	involves their tablet, and
6358000	6360000	them figuring out, well, how are we going
6360000	6362000	to
6362000	6364000	fit this
6364000	6366000	tablet gameplay into
6366000	6368000	Crysis 3?
6368000	6370000	One more story about
6370000	6372000	the Nintendo Wii, with no
6372000	6374000	U attached to it,
6374000	6376000	apparently some retailers are out of stock
6376000	6378000	right now on the Wii, GameStop,
6378000	6380000	Target apparently reported some of them
6380000	6382000	have the console back ordered,
6382000	6384000	some Best Buys and so forth are just now
6384000	6386000	getting stock in again. Here's the thing
6386000	6388000	though, most people are drawing from
6388000	6390000	this that either Nintendo's about to do a new
6390000	6392000	holiday bundle, so they're trying to get rid of what's on
6392000	6394000	shelves now, or this is
6394000	6396000	in preparation for the Wii U, they
6396000	6398000	might be trying to clean out the old stuff a little bit
6398000	6400000	to make room for the Wii U.
6400000	6402000	Loki, any insider thoughts
6402000	6404000	from your perspective?
6404000	6406000	I haven't seen a lot of demand for the systems,
6406000	6408000	I would think if they're trying to clear out
6408000	6410000	the stock that they wouldn't be on back order,
6410000	6412000	they would be in
6412000	6414000	plentiful supply because they're trying to
6414000	6416000	get rid of them. I don't think that they
6416000	6418000	have a problem with, I don't think Nintendo's sitting
6418000	6420000	on consoles right now,
6420000	6422000	it could just be that they're
6422000	6424000	just switching production from
6424000	6426000	you know,
6426000	6428000	who knows how long, I'm assuming
6428000	6430000	that they've got to start producing these consoles,
6430000	6432000	so maybe they're starting to switch
6432000	6434000	over some of those manufacturers that are doing
6434000	6436000	the Wii to making the Wii U
6436000	6438000	system instead, just to get prepared.
6438000	6440000	Before we get to Dark
6440000	6442000	Sakura's stories, let me talk
6442000	6444000	some comments from our chat room at
6444000	6446000	live.vognetwork.com
6446000	6448000	Tigerclaw says, you know with all those gold coins
6448000	6450000	Mario has collected, you think he would use those
6450000	6452000	coins to build a high end security to protect
6452000	6454000	Princess Peach?
6454000	6456000	Gameguru says, why isn't Wario the villain here?
6456000	6458000	He loves coins.
6458000	6460000	And we have an update from Bobby Blackwolf at
6460000	6462000	PlayStation Home Summerfest, going on right
6462000	6464000	now in Aurora 1.5 space,
6464000	6466000	saying that the random
6466000	6468000	number contest ended up being
6468000	6470000	that you had to use the random number
6470000	6472000	action, and whoever hit 3,
6472000	6474000	Marissa's number first, won a
6474000	6476000	gift from the Lockwood gift machine, and
6476000	6478000	the winner was GTIVW1975.
6478000	6480000	So congrats!
6480000	6482000	A clap for you.
6482000	6484000	Golf clap.
6484000	6486000	Golf clap. Golf clap.
6486000	6488000	Alright.
6488000	6490000	Let's move on, Dark Sakura.
6490000	6492000	Well we have a few goodies.
6492000	6494000	What we have is Little Big Planet 2
6494000	6496000	getting Disney Princess
6496000	6498000	edition, where they all look
6498000	6500000	kind of bizarre.
6500000	6502000	But I think everything in Little Big Planet
6502000	6504000	looks bizarre. So there's two different
6504000	6506000	DLC packs. One of them, like I said,
6506000	6508000	is the Disney Princesses.
6508000	6510000	The costume pack one has
6510000	6512000	Aurora, Cinderella, Jasmine, and Snow White.
6512000	6514000	And then the second one is Belle,
6514000	6516000	Tiana, Rapunzel, and
6516000	6518000	Ariel. Yay.
6518000	6520000	Then,
6520000	6522000	we have some information
6522000	6524000	about Dance Central 3.
6524000	6526000	We have
6526000	6528000	the songs
6528000	6530000	that are going to be out on it.
6530000	6532000	As some of these people
6532000	6534000	I really do not know who they are.
6534000	6536000	I'm assuming some of them I do.
6536000	6538000	To anyone, whoever the fuck that is,
6538000	6540000	I am the best. We have Alice DJ,
6540000	6542000	Better Off Alone, fucking love that song.
6542000	6544000	Backstreet Boys,
6544000	6546000	JJ Fad,
6546000	6548000	Lil Jon,
6548000	6550000	Eastside Boys featuring Nyan Nyan Twins,
6550000	6552000	whatever.
6552000	6554000	LMFAO, Lost Del Rio,
6554000	6556000	we have
6556000	6558000	Maroon 5 with moves like Jagger.
6558000	6560000	I actually really like that song.
6560000	6562000	We have Ice Ice Baby.
6562000	6564000	We have Vicky Sue Robinson,
6564000	6566000	Turn the Beat Around, and Village People
6566000	6568000	YMCA.
6568000	6570000	Whatever happened to Alice DJ?
6570000	6572000	That was like my college
6572000	6574000	years right there. Alice DJ is Better Off Alone.
6574000	6576000	Apparently.
6576000	6578000	And then, last but
6578000	6580000	never least, the Nintendo 3DS
6580000	6582000	XL UK
6582000	6584000	price.
6584000	6586000	This is going to be $179.99.
6586000	6588000	Again, that's in
6588000	6590000	pounds.
6590000	6592000	Tesco's, however, will be offering
6592000	6594000	the device for
6594000	6596000	£175.
6596000	6598000	So, you want it cheap, get it at
6598000	6600000	Tesco's.
6600000	6602000	Game, one more,
6602000	6604000	has a trade-in deal that for $79.99
6604000	6606000	you can trade in an old boxed
6606000	6608000	3DS and
6608000	6610000	get the 3DS XL.
6610000	6612000	So that's it.
6612000	6614000	Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.
6614000	6616000	Alright.
6616000	6618000	Moving on, we have a segment
6618000	6620000	we always do here on Orange Lawns Radio
6620000	6622000	called the Fugal Question of the Week.
6624000	6626000	You might be asking yourself,
6628000	6630000	what the hell is a Fugal?
6630000	6632000	Put Facebook
6632000	6634000	and Google Plus together
6634000	6636000	and you get Fugal. That is what it is.
6636000	6638000	We ask a question each week in our Facebook
6638000	6640000	and Google Plus communities
6640000	6642000	and you guys answer it. Here's this week's question.
6642000	6644000	There's a couple betas
6644000	6646000	going on right now, including Guild Wars 2,
6646000	6648000	Little Big Planet Karting, and
6648000	6650000	Sony PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale,
6650000	6652000	just to name a few. Have you
6652000	6654000	ever made a decision whether or not
6654000	6656000	to buy a game based off the beta?
6656000	6658000	Considering that betas are
6658000	6660000	unfinished products, do you think that
6660000	6662000	it was a fair decision
6662000	6664000	or should a company not put it out there
6664000	6666000	if it's not ready to be judged?
6666000	6668000	I thought it was a good question
6668000	6670000	not just because I thought of it.
6670000	6672000	So let's get to some of these comments
6672000	6674000	here. I want to
6674000	6676000	start with Google
6676000	6678000	Plus tonight.
6678000	6680000	And yes, there are people posting on Google Plus.
6680000	6682000	My quick impression of Google Plus.
6682000	6684000	Hello! Hello!
6684000	6686000	No, we have
6686000	6688000	two comments from Google Plus
6688000	6690000	tonight. There's
6690000	6692000	at least two people using Google Plus.
6692000	6694000	Some weeks we get four.
6694000	6696000	All right, Reddertainment says
6696000	6698000	no, but I did buy
6698000	6700000	cakes prolonging the magic after
6700000	6702000	listening to Alpha Beta Parking Lot,
6702000	6704000	which I...is he plugging something?
6704000	6706000	I don't know what the...
6706000	6708000	had nothing to do with the question, sir.
6708000	6710000	However, Flaco Jones responded
6710000	6712000	saying, I knew after playing all the
6712000	6714000	starting areas in the Final Fantasy 14 beta
6714000	6716000	that it wasn't worth buying.
6716000	6718000	I do think that was a fair decision
6718000	6720000	since the game came out a month later
6720000	6722000	and was reportedly as bad as the beta
6722000	6724000	was. Yeah, that was
6724000	6726000	a beta that ended up being pretty accurate
6726000	6728000	I gotta say. Good reminder
6728000	6730000	Flaco Jones.
6730000	6732000	Going to Facebook for some of the comments from Facebook.
6732000	6734000	Amanda, Amanda R says
6734000	6736000	I've played in betas that were out only
6736000	6738000	a couple weeks before game release
6738000	6740000	and by this time, these are mostly
6740000	6742000	finished products with only minor tweaks
6742000	6744000	being made. I have made the decision
6744000	6746000	to not buy a game when it came out because
6746000	6748000	the beta was just not fun and with
6748000	6750000	that close to the release, not
6750000	6752000	enough changes were going to be made to change the game
6752000	6754000	in any significant way.
6754000	6756000	Cody T says, I've played betas of
6756000	6758000	a million games and I think I've bought
6758000	6760000	most. I think betas are more for the
6760000	6762000	developer than for the consumer. It's a cheap
6762000	6764000	way to see exactly what is wrong with the game
6764000	6766000	by the best judge, us.
6766000	6768000	And it's a way for the gamer to be involved in the actual
6768000	6770000	development of the game.
6770000	6772000	Nick M. responds
6772000	6774000	saying, I believe a public or
6774000	6776000	large closed beta is the only responsible
6776000	6778000	decision for game companies if their game
6778000	6780000	relies heavily on multiplayer
6780000	6782000	due to the large number of, excuse me
6782000	6784000	large amount of problems that will often
6784000	6786000	otherwise show their head on launch day.
6786000	6788000	However, more often than not, betas
6788000	6790000	talk me out of buying games that I'm already
6790000	6792000	on the fence about.
6792000	6794000	Boschka responded
6794000	6796000	and said, yes, the only game
6796000	6798000	I have ever done it for is a game that's
6798000	6800000	actually free when it comes out.
6800000	6802000	Path of Exile. Think Diablo 2 and new features
6802000	6804000	and updated graphics. I donated
6804000	6806000	$10 not only to get a second beta
6806000	6808000	key for a friend, but because I love
6808000	6810000	what they're doing with that game. If I could get more
6810000	6812000	I would. Blizzard just take some
6812000	6814000	notes on how to make a good action RPG.
6814000	6816000	Ooh, sick burn.
6816000	6818000	I think it's fair. People
6818000	6820000	have to learn what a beta is for. It's not
6820000	6822000	a demo. You're testing buggy code.
6822000	6824000	You're testing builds that are normally
6824000	6826000	four to five builds behind what the devs
6826000	6828000	have. Some games basically require
6828000	6830000	betas based on the sheer size. For example,
6830000	6832000	in the Mists of Pandaria beta
6832000	6834000	they changed one ability for a
6834000	6836000	boss fight and the next thing you know there's an
6836000	6838000	elevator coming out of the ground on another continent.
6838000	6840000	If the company says before
6840000	6842000	that it's not a demo, it's a beta, I think
6842000	6844000	that is completely fair. If you don't get the
6844000	6846000	difference, you're not the type of tester they want anyway.
6846000	6848000	A long but good comment from
6848000	6850000	Boschka.
6850000	6852000	Let's see.
6852000	6854000	Wicked says, I believe betas are an
6854000	6856000	integral part of games development.
6856000	6858000	It gives the fan base an inside look at
6858000	6860000	what is to come and also gives
6860000	6862000	the developers instant public feedback to
6862000	6864000	work out any bugs the game may have.
6864000	6866000	However, game companies should be wary
6866000	6868000	about using open betas as it sometimes
6868000	6870000	gives the gaming community expectations
6870000	6872000	they may not have had before, positive
6872000	6874000	or negative.
6874000	6876000	Sometimes the game does not live up to the
6876000	6878000	over-hype that sometimes follows certain
6878000	6880000	open betas or some good games
6880000	6882000	could easily be overlooked due to
6882000	6884000	negative reactions to betas. So
6884000	6886000	while betas can easily help a game's
6886000	6888000	development, it could easily skew the game's
6888000	6890000	anticipation in the public eye.
6890000	6892000	And lastly, Chiggers
6892000	6894000	responds saying, I've bought games based on
6894000	6896000	the demos. Does that count?
6896000	6898000	Kind of. Demos
6898000	6900000	are a little different than betas. I think
6900000	6902000	kind of going back to the other points, like betas
6902000	6904000	are put out there
6904000	6906000	because they're not supposed to be demos. They're
6906000	6908000	supposed to be tests for the developers. But
6908000	6910000	kind of where I was trying to go with the question
6910000	6912000	is that a lot of people look at betas as
6912000	6914000	demos in this day and age. Is that fair?
6914000	6916000	Or should the developers be real
6916000	6918000	and realize that's how most people
6918000	6920000	are going to view it? Anyhow,
6920000	6922000	thanks for all those answers on Facebook at
6922000	6924000	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
6924000	6926000	I didn't read them all
6926000	6928000	so please go check out the post to read
6928000	6930000	some of the other great insights from
6930000	6932000	this week. Really appreciate it guys. Sorry
6932000	6934000	I couldn't read them all, but it's only
6934000	6936000	a three hour show.
6936000	6938000	Alright.
6938000	6940000	Oh, by the way, XLink
6940000	6942000	giving me the update in our chat
6942000	6944000	room at live dot vog network dot com.
6944000	6946000	Here's what happened to Alice DJ.
6946000	6948000	Quote,
6948000	6950000	after the group went their
6950000	6952000	separate ways, Prank decided
6952000	6954000	to move on to other ventures by putting her
6954000	6956000	music career aside to become a makeup
6956000	6958000	artist and beauty fashion consultant.
6958000	6960000	I remember
6960000	6962000	the video. She was a
6962000	6964000	very hip looking gal. I remember
6964000	6966000	that. They actually had like two
6966000	6968000	videos for that song, Better Off Alone.
6968000	6970000	Anyhow, well, I learned something
6970000	6972000	tonight about Alice DJ. Who knew?
6972000	6974000	I've learned about pornography
6974000	6976000	and I've learned about Alice DJ. Who
6976000	6978000	knew? Marissa's
6978000	6980000	hiding her head. This is adorable.
6980000	6982000	Loki,
6982000	6984000	what do you got for us next in
6984000	6986000	other gaming news?
6986000	6988000	Alright, so let's talk a little
6988000	6990000	bit about
6990000	6992000	you know, rock band. And this is kind of funny
6992000	6994000	because I don't know
6994000	6996000	if you guys remember, a couple months back we had a
6996000	6998000	scare where, hey, guess what?
6998000	7000000	You know rock band that you purchased
7000000	7002000	on IOS and stuff like that?
7002000	7004000	It's being delisted. It's being taken away.
7004000	7006000	And you know that game you just
7006000	7008000	purchased? Well, now it's going to be completely useless
7008000	7010000	because you're not going to
7010000	7012000	be able to get anything anymore for it.
7012000	7014000	It's just, it's going to be gone.
7014000	7016000	Well, and you may remember
7016000	7018000	that they came out and said, oh, no, no, no.
7018000	7020000	That's not happening. That message was
7020000	7022000	sent in error. Well, the error was that
7022000	7024000	it was sent two months early.
7024000	7026000	Because now, yes, they are actually
7026000	7028000	delisting the game.
7028000	7030000	Well, I don't think people were mad
7030000	7032000	that the game was being delisted. I mean,
7032000	7034000	whatever. People are pissed if it wouldn't
7034000	7036000	work anymore. That was the
7036000	7038000	original, like, scare campaign going around is that
7038000	7040000	haha, you just bought this game and none of
7040000	7042000	your DLC or anything is going to work anymore.
7042000	7044000	LOL, bye. You know,
7044000	7046000	but that doesn't appear to be the case. I mean,
7046000	7048000	if they're just pulling it from the store, then whatever.
7048000	7050000	Well, they're pulling basically the
7050000	7052000	rock band, um, IOS game
7052000	7054000	and rock band reloaded IOS game
7054000	7056000	and all the, um, I think
7056000	7058000	all the DLC for it as well.
7058000	7060000	Yes, you will not be able
7060000	7062000	to purchase any more DLC for it.
7062000	7064000	So,
7064000	7066000	and that's supposed to happen effective
7066000	7068000	July 31st.
7068000	7070000	So, a couple days from now.
7072000	7074000	Well, yeah.
7074000	7076000	As a musician, like,
7076000	7078000	yeah, um,
7078000	7080000	which, I'm sorry,
7080000	7082000	I'm actually just being unemployed.
7082000	7084000	But,
7084000	7086000	with regard to the, um,
7086000	7088000	the music games, it's actually, especially
7088000	7090000	guitar players, like, games like Guitar Hero,
7090000	7092000	especially at the time, it was at its height,
7092000	7094000	really enraged.
7094000	7096000	You know, musicians, they got so angry,
7096000	7098000	especially since a lot of people were misinformed
7098000	7100000	and they, you know, you,
7100000	7102000	I even heard a lot of people
7102000	7104000	ignorantly at GameStop believing that it could teach
7104000	7106000	you how to play guitar. However,
7106000	7108000	um, I ended up, um,
7108000	7110000	my friend's mother ended up winning a free copy
7110000	7112000	of Rocksmith, so we played it.
7112000	7114000	And, um, that was actually one where you, uh,
7114000	7116000	they gave you, you know, an XLR cable, and you actually,
7116000	7118000	you could actually plug in your guitar to the Xbox.
7118000	7120000	And that actually was a pretty good game, and then
7120000	7122000	actually, I mean, you plug in your own guitar to it, and that actually,
7122000	7124000	um, I had
7124000	7126000	guitar players play it, and they actually found it challenging
7126000	7128000	and interesting, and it actually, you know,
7128000	7130000	accurately, you know, presented theory and things like that.
7130000	7132000	You know, I'm glad you said that.
7132000	7134000	And you don't, you didn't
7134000	7136000	know this before you said that, but I usually have to
7136000	7138000	refrain from comment on that game, because
7138000	7140000	a really good friend of mine knows somebody
7140000	7142000	that's a big part of the development of that
7142000	7144000	game, so I usually don't try
7144000	7146000	to avoid the topic on the show because of
7146000	7148000	conflict, but, uh, I'm glad you said that.
7148000	7150000	I'm sure that'll make somebody very happy to know that.
7150000	7152000	Yeah, I didn't get that far into
7152000	7154000	the game, but I mean, I enjoyed it, and I think
7154000	7156000	that, um, you know,
7156000	7158000	it's not gonna turn you into a virtuoso,
7158000	7160000	but I mean, um, you know,
7160000	7162000	if you're too cheap to go, to go get lessons
7162000	7164000	immediately, it's a good place to start, just to get, like,
7164000	7166000	a very basic foundation, and it's fun.
7166000	7168000	Yeah, I understand that game does
7168000	7170000	have kind of quite a bit of, like, a cultish
7170000	7172000	audience, I don't know what it sounds like, but, like,
7172000	7174000	a lot of the makeup of, I
7174000	7176000	think, who's into that game is kind of like people
7176000	7178000	who are rediscovering
7178000	7180000	getting into music maybe at a later age.
7180000	7182000	Like, it's not like kids and teenagers
7182000	7184000	and so forth playing it that rock band
7184000	7186000	tends to skew towards, like college parties and stuff,
7186000	7188000	but, like, Rocksmith is, like, 30-somethings
7188000	7190000	who always wanted to learn to play
7190000	7192000	an instrument that never did.
7192000	7194000	I wish that they had, um, I guess it didn't be
7194000	7196000	That's my impression, it's not, like, just my impression of it.
7196000	7198000	I, um, I guess it didn't, you know,
7198000	7200000	my understanding is, you know, it didn't
7200000	7202000	blow up, necessarily, but, I mean, I wish
7202000	7204000	that they had a, um,
7204000	7206000	a wider, um, library
7206000	7208000	of music, you know, it started to when it came
7208000	7210000	out, they started releasing stuff all the time, but I wish it had
7210000	7212000	more, you know, but, you know, that's just selfishly
7212000	7214000	excited, you know, it'd be fun to play.
7214000	7216000	Well, they do DLC pretty regularly.
7216000	7218000	And you're in luck, because they have Rocksmith
7218000	7220000	and Bass, or Guitar and
7220000	7222000	Bass coming out, uh, this October.
7222000	7224000	You don't need a game
7224000	7226000	You don't need a game to teach you bass, no.
7226000	7228000	I'm kidding.
7228000	7230000	I'm kidding, actually.
7230000	7232000	It does require
7232000	7234000	talent. Just not a lot.
7234000	7236000	You don't have to be a
7236000	7238000	retarded monkey.
7238000	7240000	No, actually, though, I have friends like
7240000	7242000	Freebo. I have friends who are excellent bass players.
7242000	7244000	And all the running musicians joke, making fun of
7244000	7246000	bass players. Good times,
7246000	7248000	good times.
7248000	7250000	It's just, are you a fan of Green Day?
7250000	7252000	Like, I like Green Day,
7252000	7254000	but let's be real, a lot of their songs are kind of like
7254000	7256000	the same chord over and over, and it cracked
7256000	7258000	me up, because he was sitting there, he's
7258000	7260000	gonna be the guy that's lead singer in the band
7260000	7262000	is gonna be one of the, not like a judge,
7262000	7264000	but like a mentor or something on The Voice.
7264000	7266000	But he's working with Christina
7266000	7268000	Aguilera. And I don't know why,
7268000	7270000	but I found that to be like the funniest thing I'd heard
7270000	7272000	all week. Okay. You're not gonna
7272000	7274000	appreciate this, but any other
7274000	7276000	musicians listening to this
7276000	7278000	and the
7278000	7280000	band that now
7280000	7282000	knows my embarrassing past that I've told
7282000	7284000	to tune into will appreciate this.
7284000	7286000	Green Day is
7286000	7288000	kind of like the Creedence Clearwater
7288000	7290000	of their time.
7290000	7292000	I know that sounds obtuse,
7292000	7294000	but there's always this joke that like
7294000	7296000	Creedence Clearwater songs and John Fogerty's songs
7296000	7298000	only require three chords to play.
7298000	7300000	And that is essentially, I mean, there is
7300000	7302000	something to be said about, you know, Green Day's later
7302000	7304000	artistic merit, you know, and there are things
7304000	7306000	to be appreciated about it, but
7306000	7308000	do I think that they should be
7308000	7310000	held in that high of a regard?
7310000	7312000	No. Well, I'm not a member
7312000	7314000	of the cult though, you know.
7314000	7316000	I appreciate some of the things that they've done,
7316000	7318000	but I'm not a cult member or anything.
7318000	7320000	You know, and it's amazing where they've come, you know,
7320000	7322000	singing songs about acne and masturbation
7322000	7324000	to
7324000	7326000	guitars that were out of tune.
7326000	7328000	To like commentary on President Bush and so
7328000	7330000	forth, and that Broadway play.
7330000	7332000	They've come so, oh god.
7332000	7334000	Rissa, you alright over there?
7334000	7336000	I feel like, you know, like
7336000	7338000	Green Day songs with, you know,
7338000	7340000	Fosse moves.
7340000	7342000	Uh,
7342000	7344000	Stan in our chat rooms, you are
7344000	7346000	spurring some music discussion in our chat rooms.
7346000	7348000	Stan says, same with Hansen.
7348000	7350000	Bop is only three chords.
7352000	7354000	They didn't even have three hits.
7356000	7358000	They had like 30
7358000	7360000	babies between them all though.
7360000	7362000	The girl in Hansen's
7362000	7364000	pretty cute.
7366000	7368000	No, they're actually all from evangelicals.
7368000	7370000	That means Justin Bieber
7370000	7372000	is like the Hansen of our
7372000	7374000	time, basically.
7374000	7376000	Justin Bieber has his own video game now too.
7376000	7378000	Oh god, I hope not.
7378000	7380000	People don't understand. Teenage girls
7380000	7382000	are stupid. I said this is
7382000	7384000	a former teenage girl.
7386000	7388000	As one who was once
7388000	7390000	a teenage girl. I was there, I was there.
7390000	7392000	I have authority on this subject.
7392000	7394000	I do. I mean, granted,
7394000	7396000	I never had bop posters on my wall
7396000	7398000	or anything. No, no, no, no, no, dear.
7398000	7400000	This is what you get for being younger than me.
7400000	7402000	I had new kids on the block.
7402000	7404000	Everyone can shut up.
7404000	7406000	I was, the kids
7406000	7408000	in my school called Victoria.
7408000	7410000	So,
7410000	7412000	so I was very much the
7412000	7414000	anti that, but the thing that people don't get
7414000	7416000	about this, and of course, yes, it's interesting
7416000	7418000	how the media will exploit everything when it comes
7418000	7420000	to a tween star like this, including
7420000	7422000	the areas of video games and apps
7422000	7424000	and all this crap, but it's just
7424000	7426000	just, they just
7426000	7428000	found a boy to fill
7428000	7430000	the slot of cute teenage boys
7430000	7432000	singing songs to seduce, it could
7432000	7434000	have been anyone, you know. They just,
7434000	7436000	you just put him in the spot and they put the marketing
7436000	7438000	movement behind him and done.
7438000	7440000	It could have been anybody. It had nothing to do with
7440000	7442000	who Justin Bieber is. Nothing.
7442000	7444000	Sorry. It fascinates me at what musicians
7444000	7446000	get movies, too.
7446000	7448000	Like, Justin Bieber
7448000	7450000	gets his movie at like the Megaplex and so forth
7450000	7452000	and then fucking Katy Perry
7452000	7454000	has this big,
7454000	7456000	uh oh, uh oh.
7456000	7458000	I just opened Pandora's box.
7458000	7460000	If Katy Perry
7460000	7462000	gets her own movie,
7462000	7464000	I should have, you know,
7464000	7466000	my own, you know, like quadruple
7466000	7468000	sequel and then mini
7468000	7470000	series and TV shows.
7470000	7472000	Let's face it, she got the movie
7472000	7474000	because of her titties, okay?
7476000	7478000	I mean, she has some cute
7478000	7480000	songs, blah, blah, blah, but mainly it's because
7480000	7482000	she's beautiful, you know, and people
7482000	7484000	like talking about her boobies, apparently.
7484000	7486000	So, that's why she- And Elmo.
7486000	7488000	So, I deserve my own series.
7488000	7490000	You should be a Star Trek next to that.
7490000	7492000	You should be like four TV
7492000	7494000	series, what is it, like
7494000	7496000	nine movies and fanfic.
7496000	7498000	If her movies alone get her
7498000	7500000	a movie, I deserve so much more.
7500000	7502000	But then, here's
7502000	7504000	what fascinates me, like, yeah,
7504000	7506000	Katy Perry has some catchy songs, whatever.
7506000	7508000	When you're drunk at a gay bar, you
7508000	7510000	don't care. Oh, Katy Perry, I love her!
7510000	7512000	You know? She's a big marketing team
7512000	7514000	too. But, I mean, she's kind of a tool.
7514000	7516000	But then, you have, like,
7516000	7518000	LCD sound system had, like,
7518000	7520000	their big, you know, farewell thing and all that
7520000	7522000	and like, what did they get? They got
7522000	7524000	like, they got a Fathom event.
7524000	7526000	They got like, their movies
7526000	7528000	like one night only at the local
7528000	7530000	cinema.
7530000	7532000	Life is not fair. Before the Metropolitan
7532000	7534000	Opera, you know, movie theater
7534000	7536000	night, you know?
7536000	7538000	Poor guys. Alright.
7538000	7540000	Anyhow.
7540000	7542000	ActDeft in our chatroom says, Marissa
7542000	7544000	the movie 2, electit boobaloo.
7544000	7548000	That should be the name of your next album.
7548000	7550000	Alright, moving
7550000	7552000	on.
7552000	7554000	That's how Katy Perry sells shit, I can do it too.
7554000	7556000	You just,
7556000	7558000	you gotta get out of the little affair
7558000	7560000	and get into the pop music.
7560000	7562000	All I need is some vocorder and some autotune.
7562000	7564000	Just whine about a boy who broke up with you
7564000	7566000	years ago or something, you know?
7566000	7568000	Just sing about Dave Coulier.
7568000	7570000	You know?
7570000	7572000	Insult the women that actually are gay
7572000	7574000	and can't help it and pretend to be a lesbian
7574000	7576000	and, you know, to amuse men.
7576000	7578000	It's great. Get in a
7578000	7580000	pillow fight, braid somebody's hair.
7580000	7582000	Oh my god!
7582000	7584000	Free someone's bra. We used to do
7584000	7586000	that dip of bra and orange juice and put it in the freezer
7586000	7588000	for the first girl who fell asleep.
7588000	7590000	Yes.
7590000	7592000	That's hot. Keep talking. Alright.
7592000	7594000	Moving on.
7594000	7596000	Okay, this is bad.
7596000	7598000	Because we're going to go from such humorous, happy
7598000	7600000	discussions to really unfortunate
7600000	7602000	situations.
7602000	7604000	I'm about to Debbie
7604000	7606000	Downer the show a little bit.
7606000	7608000	And talk about some layoffs.
7608000	7610000	Stop laughing, Marissa.
7610000	7612000	Stop laughing, Marissa. Inappropriate.
7612000	7614000	No, this news really does
7614000	7616000	suck. Maybe we should skip
7616000	7618000	this story.
7618000	7620000	Read it already.
7620000	7622000	We need variety.
7622000	7624000	Uh oh, Marissa's choking.
7624000	7626000	Alright.
7628000	7630000	Serious face.
7630000	7632000	Microsoft laid off a
7632000	7634000	small, as they put it, number of positions
7634000	7636000	at their Vancouver based development
7636000	7638000	studio. This is because Project
7638000	7640000	Columbia, whatever this was, we
7640000	7642000	don't know what the real name was, it got
7642000	7644000	cancelled. It's off the
7644000	7646000	books now. It was supposed to be an educational
7646000	7648000	Connect title. It was going to educate
7648000	7650000	young people. It was going to pair books with
7650000	7652000	music and illustrations. I guess
7652000	7654000	it had something to do with the Sesame
7654000	7656000	Workshop as well. That doesn't necessarily
7656000	7658000	mean it was a Sesame Street game. But it
7658000	7660000	sounds like it was something that was kind of geared towards kids.
7660000	7662000	Or the like.
7662000	7664000	Wonder Book Connect.
7664000	7666000	And then they saw the Wonder Book presentation like, wow.
7666000	7668000	That looks like shit.
7668000	7670000	And then they're like, woo. Scrap that.
7670000	7672000	Perhaps. But layoffs are
7672000	7674000	never good news. Especially
7674000	7676000	also when they hit Warner Brothers. Seattle
7676000	7678000	also had some layoffs hit them this
7678000	7680000	week. They were currently working on
7680000	7682000	Lord of the Rings Guardians of Middle Earth.
7682000	7684000	And if you might be thinking to yourself, God, they're
7684000	7686000	still making Lord of the Rings games? Well,
7686000	7688000	there's a Hobbit movie coming out at the end of the year. You might have
7688000	7690000	heard of it. It's a big deal. So yeah.
7690000	7692000	Moolah moolah. Unfortunately,
7692000	7694000	not enough moolah, apparently.
7694000	7696000	Layoffs hit the studio once back in
7696000	7698000	November that was supposed to be 60 people.
7698000	7700000	And a statement from WB
7700000	7702000	says, quote, due to shifting business
7702000	7704000	imperatives, Warner Brothers Game
7704000	7706000	Seattle has made staff reductions. The
7706000	7708000	group will continue to remain an integral part of
7708000	7710000	Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment.
7710000	7712000	Yikes. Now,
7712000	7714000	since I would like to end with a little bit of a positive,
7714000	7716000	id Software,
7716000	7718000	id Software, you know,
7718000	7720000	they made like Doom and shit.
7720000	7722000	They are actually hiring
7722000	7724000	right now. They are
7724000	7726000	hiring on their website for a
7726000	7728000	UI programmer job for, quote,
7728000	7730000	an unannounced game on future
7730000	7732000	generation consoles.
7732000	7734000	So could it be something that
7734000	7736000	is a sequel to one of the past
7736000	7738000	franchises? Possibly, because the listing
7738000	7740000	actually says, quote, familiarity with
7740000	7742000	id Software games, characters, brands,
7742000	7744000	and universes. So who knows?
7744000	7746000	It could be a new Quake. It could be a sequel
7746000	7748000	to Rage. It could be a game with
7748000	7750000	Space Marines versus either
7750000	7752000	demons or
7752000	7754000	aliens. It could be Commander Keen
7754000	7756000	6 or 7 or
7756000	7758000	whatever they're on now for all we know. So
7758000	7760000	there you go. Anyhow,
7760000	7762000	that's it for
7762000	7764000	that story. Let's move on. Dark
7764000	7766000	Soccer. Okay, well, in other
7766000	7768000	news, how about
7768000	7770000	something about that PlayStation
7770000	7772000	All-Stars crap that's coming out?
7772000	7774000	Oh, you think it's crap?
7774000	7776000	I don't know.
7776000	7778000	We're gonna, actually, we're gonna have Beta, somebody
7778000	7780000	we know very well has been in the Beta.
7780000	7782000	We're gonna have Beta impressions in a little bit.
7782000	7784000	Well, I'm not necessarily going to call it
7784000	7786000	crap. I'm gonna call it potential crap.
7786000	7788000	So, um,
7788000	7790000	there are some, uh,
7790000	7792000	people who have gone through the data
7792000	7794000	files for PlayStation All-Stars Battle
7794000	7796000	Royale and has nine
7796000	7798000	stages, eight characters, and a bunch of other
7798000	7800000	stuff. So what we have
7800000	7802000	is a Bioshock Infinite stage,
7802000	7804000	um, Sir Daniel
7804000	7806000	is it Fortesca Fortescue
7806000	7808000	from Medieval?
7808000	7810000	Dante from Devil May Cry, Spike
7810000	7812000	from Ape Escape, Raiden from Metal Gear Solid,
7812000	7814000	um, Nariko
7814000	7816000	from, uh, Heavenly Sword,
7816000	7818000	and, um,
7818000	7820000	we've got David Hayter saying he's
7820000	7822000	recording dialogue.
7822000	7824000	So, and he's, um, sorry,
7824000	7826000	he's Snake, so.
7826000	7828000	I believe all the characters that you
7828000	7830000	mentioned, but they're new characters that haven't been
7830000	7832000	released yet. Well, yeah. Well, I'm gonna go through the whole list.
7832000	7834000	This is the, the new stuff, okay?
7834000	7836000	We have Dante, Evil Cole,
7836000	7838000	um, Nariko, Raiden, Sackboy,
7838000	7840000	Ratchet and Clank, Sir Daniel
7840000	7842000	Fortescue, and Spike.
7842000	7844000	And then for items,
7844000	7846000	there's an Atomizer,
7846000	7848000	the Balmusu Axe,
7848000	7850000	Boots of Hermes,
7850000	7852000	Freeze Missile, Golf Club
7852000	7854000	from Hot Shots Golf, Gravity Shield
7854000	7856000	from Wipeout, Hedgehog, um,
7856000	7858000	Grenade, uh, the Dovat
7858000	7860000	Laser Designator,
7860000	7862000	Leech Beam, Murder of Crows
7862000	7864000	from Bioshock, uh,
7864000	7866000	Railgun, Razor Claws,
7866000	7868000	RPG, Scythe, Spear,
7868000	7870000	Sonic Rift, and Sackbot.
7870000	7872000	And then, supporting
7872000	7874000	characters, as in minions, Captain
7874000	7876000	Quark, Kai from Heavenly
7876000	7878000	Sword, Kat from Devil May Cry, Kia,
7878000	7880000	Monkey from Ape Escape,
7880000	7882000	Nyx, Pierre from
7882000	7884000	Doko Demolisho, um,
7884000	7886000	Sackbot, and Sam
7886000	7888000	from Metal Gear Rising.
7888000	7890000	And then it says, there's, like, just a bunch
7890000	7892000	of modes, but as far as stage goes,
7892000	7894000	Alden's Tower, Black Rock Stadium,
7894000	7896000	Columbia,
7896000	7898000	uh, Franzia from Locoroco,
7898000	7900000	that actually looks pretty neat. Um,
7900000	7902000	Is it Franzia boxed wine as well?
7902000	7904000	No, that's Franzia. This is
7904000	7906000	Franzia. Well, my bad.
7906000	7908000	Marissa's, Marissa and I
7908000	7910000	think alike. Paris, tip it!
7910000	7912000	Tip it, Kathleen, tip it!
7912000	7914000	We think, like, old 50-year-old. I'm sorry, I think of
7914000	7916000	Kathleen Griffin.
7916000	7918000	I do too. I have San Francisco from
7918000	7920000	Resistance, um, Stillaways from Uncharted,
7920000	7922000	Time Station from Ape Escape.
7922000	7924000	So, yeah, I'm most excited about Locoroco
7924000	7926000	stage, really.
7926000	7928000	And all these were from, hacked from files
7928000	7930000	from the beta. Yes.
7930000	7932000	Hackers gonna hack! Exactly!
7932000	7934000	People should know that by now.
7934000	7936000	Hack like what? I'm looking forward
7936000	7938000	to playing as Parappa. I think the
7938000	7940000	game looks fun. Yeah.
7940000	7942000	I, I heard, I'll let the,
7942000	7944000	the person who's gonna review the beta in a minute here,
7944000	7946000	which we just talked about, you shouldn't
7946000	7948000	do that, but hey! And that is, I believe,
7948000	7950000	against the, uh, end-user license
7950000	7952000	agreement, or the, uh, was it the, um,
7952000	7954000	confidentiality agreement?
7954000	7956000	This... We ain't the
7956000	7958000	ones gonna get sued out for it!
7958000	7960000	Ain't our asses! It's not me! It's not me
7960000	7962000	playing it! I got a special tipster.
7962000	7964000	We'll, we'll break out the,
7964000	7966000	the voice, uh,
7966000	7968000	disguiser, and the shadow,
7968000	7970000	everything for, so they aren't
7970000	7972000	identified. Well, tech,
7972000	7974000	this person's using someone else's beta.
7974000	7976000	So, it's even, like,
7976000	7978000	I know, right? A woo-woo!
7978000	7980000	Anyhow.
7980000	7982000	Um,
7982000	7984000	moving on. Loki.
7984000	7986000	I wish I was in a
7986000	7988000	beta test for that game.
7988000	7990000	Looks awesome. I try,
7990000	7992000	I was like, give me, give me the logon
7992000	7994000	and password so I can get into.
7994000	7996000	Um,
7996000	7998000	so there was a hack that was, um,
7998000	8000000	demonstrated by a Russian hacker,
8000000	8002000	uh,
8002000	8004000	using, uh,
8004000	8006000	basically a way to spoof the
8006000	8008000	iOS, or the Apple Store,
8008000	8010000	um, servers
8010000	8012000	to allow him to make
8012000	8014000	free in-app purchases.
8014000	8016000	Pretty much, um, they say,
8016000	8018000	uh, you know, he
8018000	8020000	enabled, I guess, 8.4 million
8020000	8022000	fake in-app purchases.
8022000	8024000	Over 115 games were affected,
8024000	8026000	including, um, you know,
8026000	8028000	all the big stuff, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja,
8028000	8030000	Infinity Blade, Plants vs. Zombies,
8030000	8032000	uh, that kind of stuff. And,
8032000	8034000	um, apparently, Apple, though,
8034000	8036000	is, of course, gonna fix this. They say
8036000	8038000	the fix will check whether in-app
8038000	8040000	downloads were valid, and
8040000	8042000	fake purchases will be wiped from the
8042000	8044000	device. In other words,
8044000	8046000	it's gonna slow everything down.
8046000	8048000	So, thank you
8048000	8050000	for ruining it for everybody. Appreciate that.
8050000	8052000	Of course, you know, um, it's gonna require
8052000	8054000	that, you know, these people that publish
8054000	8056000	these apps are gonna need to update, um,
8056000	8058000	their apps with a new API for it.
8058000	8060000	Um,
8060000	8062000	I don't know how they're gonna, how's that
8062000	8064000	really gonna work? Like, say, for example, I
8064000	8066000	use that glitch or whatever,
8066000	8068000	or that exploit to purchase
8068000	8070000	a bunch of tower bucks or something in
8070000	8072000	Tiny Tower, and then I spend
8072000	8074000	all of them. How are you gonna take
8074000	8076000	that away? I mean,
8076000	8078000	I don't see how it's gonna work. I don't
8078000	8080000	think you can at that point. I don't think
8080000	8082000	for consumables like that, I don't think you can
8082000	8084000	actually do anything. I see, like,
8084000	8086000	okay, if I purchase, you know,
8086000	8088000	songs from Rock Band or something like that,
8088000	8090000	make sure that I actually purchase those
8090000	8092000	and then go from there,
8092000	8094000	but...
8094000	8096000	Maybe the game could break?
8096000	8098000	Like, if it takes you into negative tower bucks
8098000	8100000	or whatever, it just says, fuck you,
8100000	8102000	I'm out. Then the game stops
8102000	8104000	working or something. I don't know.
8104000	8106000	From what I'm aware, though, the hacker, I don't think
8106000	8108000	has released, um, the method
8108000	8110000	of how that's done, although
8110000	8112000	it's just being done, like, um,
8112000	8114000	somehow, I guess, he just spoofed
8114000	8116000	the, um, response from those
8116000	8118000	servers. Very interesting.
8118000	8120000	Hmm.
8120000	8122000	Alright, well, moving on to a different topic, this
8122000	8124000	has to do with Sonic and All-Stars
8124000	8126000	Racing Transformed. This is that Sonic
8126000	8128000	game that has all the really interesting characters,
8128000	8130000	like Danica Patrick is, like, a playable
8130000	8132000	character, and then we talked to Wreck-It Ralph,
8132000	8134000	uh, last week. Well, um,
8134000	8136000	apparently, there is, uh, an interesting comment
8136000	8138000	that was made this week. Uh, this was
8138000	8140000	by the digital, or, excuse me,
8140000	8142000	the executive producer, Steve
8142000	8144000	Lysette, who's with Sumo Digital.
8144000	8146000	Uh, he's basically implying that the
8146000	8148000	characters could be different
8148000	8150000	depending on which platform you purchased the game
8150000	8178000	on.
8178000	8180000	Why is this? Well, some platforms
8180000	8182000	have characters that are unique to that platform.
8182000	8184000	I'm not gonna say which, that's part
8184000	8186000	of the fun of the reveals. Some are
8186000	8188000	Sega characters, some are not.
8188000	8190000	Don't bother asking.
8190000	8192000	This has a lot of people speculating
8192000	8194000	that maybe the Wreck-It Ralph
8194000	8196000	will end up being a Nintendo exclusive
8196000	8198000	guy because of all
8198000	8200000	those, you know, stories about how
8200000	8202000	the Nintendo characters are the ones in the movie,
8202000	8204000	and apparently, the Wreck-It Ralph
8204000	8206000	official game is only gonna be on the Nintendo
8206000	8208000	consoles. It's kind of leading people down
8208000	8210000	those lines. We won't really know until
8210000	8212000	the rosters are revealed for all three platforms,
8212000	8214000	but, interesting speculation.
8214000	8216000	And I believe the reason why,
8216000	8218000	uh, well, the reason why it's
8218000	8220000	exclusive on the Nintendo platforms is also
8220000	8222000	they're kicking in some money for marketing as
8222000	8224000	well, um, for the Activision
8224000	8226000	game, so, it makes sense.
8226000	8228000	It does, it does.
8228000	8230000	Alright, well, let's
8230000	8232000	take a look at our
8232000	8234000	mailbag.
8234000	8240000	Music
8240000	8242000	Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the
8242000	8244000	mailbag head first and reads a few emails
8244000	8246000	for you. Mailbag at
8246000	8248000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8248000	8250000	Now, Dark Sakura, when you weren't here last week,
8250000	8252000	there was, like, eight emails sent to the show.
8252000	8254000	So, we only read half of them,
8254000	8256000	and we saved the other half for you. Well, there's
8256000	8258000	three that I saw.
8258000	8260000	These might be the leftovers from last week, I know.
8260000	8262000	Well, this is July 22nd, so.
8262000	8264000	Um, greetings, OLR.
8264000	8266000	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle. I just wanted to
8266000	8268000	share how much I love Steam sales, and boo
8268000	8270000	to Origin. As someone
8270000	8272000	who doesn't need many games on
8272000	8274000	release days, I always wait for the
8274000	8276000	Steam sales. I can't wait for this holiday.
8276000	8278000	If you want, please share the damage
8278000	8280000	that Steam did, um, to each of you.
8280000	8282000	Your loyal turtle and Philly series turtle.
8282000	8284000	And I think I just bought, uh,
8284000	8286000	Borderlands, that's all. We ended up, uh, actually
8286000	8288000	talking about the Steam sale last week a little bit,
8288000	8290000	so I'll, uh, kind of point you back
8290000	8292000	to that show, but Dark Sakura, that was the only
8292000	8294000	damage they did to you, was Borderlands?
8294000	8296000	Yeah, pretty much. Oh, we'll have to play together sometime.
8296000	8298000	I have to actually install it.
8298000	8300000	Marissa, you ever use Steam? I know you're not,
8300000	8302000	you're not a huge, huge gamer girl, but you,
8302000	8304000	you like the adventure games. I gotta say, Steam is
8304000	8306000	a good place to look for some of the newer stuff,
8306000	8308000	if you're into adventure games. I don't know.
8308000	8310000	I have not, but I probably should, because I have had
8310000	8312000	the same recommendation as well. Yeah, because some
8312000	8314000	of that stuff goes on sale, like, dirt cheap
8314000	8316000	sometimes, and it's like, if you, they actually
8316000	8318000	have a Lucas Arts pack. I
8318000	8320000	don't, something's missing from it, it was just
8320000	8322000	probably, oh yeah, Maniac Mansion, because that was the Game of the Week
8322000	8324000	last, or the Maniac Mansion sequel
8324000	8326000	was the Game of the Week last week, and,
8326000	8328000	um, because we let Alan pick when you were out, and he
8328000	8330000	picked the Day of the Tentacle, and that was one of the
8330000	8332000	Lucas Arts games that's missing from that pack.
8332000	8334000	But you can get, I think it has, like,
8334000	8336000	Loom and some of the other things that Dark Sakura's picked
8336000	8338000	in the past. That's one of the big things on there,
8338000	8340000	so, yeah, pretty cool.
8340000	8342000	Alright.
8342000	8344000	Oh, yes, next email.
8344000	8346000	Um, the theme,
8346000	8348000	the subject is Garris.
8348000	8350000	And it starts off, Garris.
8350000	8352000	Hello sentient creatures. There is a media
8352000	8354000	event that I'm sure you are aware of. This is something
8354000	8356000	that people have been eagerly anticipating,
8356000	8358000	and have been looking forward to
8358000	8360000	for a while. I'm also sure that many of us
8360000	8362000	out there saw this media event.
8362000	8364000	However, there are some of us who haven't seen
8364000	8366000	the media event, or have
8366000	8368000	yet to see this media event in
8368000	8370000	its entirety. It is for this reason
8370000	8372000	that I email you today. Please, for the
8372000	8374000	sake of all of us who haven't seen it, please don't spoil
8374000	8376000	the British Open. Stay black,
8376000	8378000	redertainment, Garris.
8378000	8380000	Or the Olympics. I think the joke
8380000	8382000	might have been Batman, Dark Knight Rises.
8382000	8384000	I saw it.
8384000	8386000	It wasn't bad.
8386000	8388000	It had some really slow parts,
8388000	8390000	though. It did have some slow parts,
8390000	8392000	but I was okay with it in the scope of the
8392000	8394000	big picture. I'm not gonna spoil.
8394000	8396000	I'm not gonna do that to you guys. I have one question
8396000	8398000	from that movie. What? Why did Bane
8398000	8400000	sound Belgian?
8400000	8402000	Is it just me, or did he sound Belgian?
8402000	8404000	I do not think you should talk about
8404000	8406000	his voice in a negative manner.
8406000	8408000	He sounded like Count von Count to me.
8408000	8410000	He sounded Belgian.
8410000	8412000	He sounded...
8412000	8414000	With that same pleasant
8414000	8416000	Belgian... I liked his
8416000	8418000	voice, even if it was a little silly.
8418000	8420000	He sounded very pleasant. I'm glad
8420000	8422000	they changed it from that trailer, though.
8422000	8424000	Like in the trailer, Bane sounded
8424000	8426000	like this.
8428000	8430000	Okay, Tom Hardy.
8430000	8432000	Tom Hardy is...
8432000	8434000	I'm just saying this.
8434000	8436000	As your resident gay gamer,
8436000	8438000	I'm just putting this out there. Tom Hardy
8438000	8440000	is so fucking hot. Like, I can't
8440000	8442000	even. I can't even.
8442000	8444000	He's no Bruce
8444000	8446000	Campbell, I'm sorry.
8446000	8448000	He wasn't that hot as Bane.
8448000	8450000	Oh, the movie. The movie, can I just say?
8450000	8452000	It wasn't as good as the last
8452000	8454000	one. I didn't say the last one. The Dark Knight
8454000	8456000	will probably be the best comic book
8456000	8458000	movie they ever freakin' make.
8458000	8460000	But, I honestly
8460000	8462000	think Dark Knight was better than Avengers. Don't get me wrong,
8462000	8464000	I love the Avengers, but Dark Knight was off-manning.
8464000	8466000	DC fails.
8466000	8468000	This new movie was pretty good, except
8468000	8470000	the tw...
8470000	8472000	I liked Catwoman. There was a twist.
8472000	8474000	I was pleasantly surprised with Catwoman.
8474000	8476000	Anne Hathaway is a goddess.
8476000	8478000	Let's just be real. Anne Hathaway deserves
8478000	8480000	to have statues built of her. The ending twist, I should have seen
8480000	8482000	coming because I saw the casting.
8482000	8484000	But, it still threw me.
8484000	8486000	Even though I knew!
8486000	8488000	Couple twists, and one of them I
8488000	8490000	saw within like five seconds of the character
8490000	8492000	showing up. I'm like, oh, not
8492000	8494000	that. That's the one I probably
8494000	8496000	should have seen coming because I knew better. Anyway, yeah.
8496000	8498000	Okay.
8498000	8500000	So, next email. I don't want to spoil anything.
8500000	8502000	Hi again, OLR. Well, Rob,
8502000	8504000	I wrote in last week requesting all your knowledge
8504000	8506000	on Final Fantasy XI as we ventured
8506000	8508000	into Van... Van...
8508000	8510000	Vanidel is how he wrote it. I guess it's
8510000	8512000	Vanidel. Oh, Vanidel. Whatever.
8512000	8514000	To say stepping foot
8514000	8516000	back into that world again was fresh
8516000	8518000	and very nostalgic. I was greeted with many open
8518000	8520000	arms and more than a few people to help me
8520000	8522000	get my gears back in line to play.
8522000	8524000	Although, after playing for about
8524000	8526000	six hours in between two days, I found myself
8526000	8528000	wishing there were more wowish things
8528000	8530000	about it. Oh well, I guess
8530000	8532000	all other MMOs
8532000	8534000	were the gateway drug to the ultra drug
8534000	8536000	wow as we know it. As a sucker
8536000	8538000	that is on the annual pass plan,
8538000	8540000	I guess I'll go roll a new
8540000	8542000	toon and start my adventure all over again.
8542000	8544000	Just so I don't feel like I'm
8544000	8546000	giving charity money to Blizzard.
8546000	8548000	Just
8548000	8550000	really hoping something fresh comes
8550000	8552000	from Guild Wars 2. Not being
8552000	8554000	a hater or a troll, but it
8554000	8556000	would be exciting to see a new MMO
8556000	8558000	come out and be the prolific wow killer.
8558000	8560000	Your thoughts? And this is from
8560000	8562000	Travis. I'm gonna
8562000	8564000	use this opportunity to give a cheap plug
8564000	8566000	to the best little Horde house in Azeroth.
8566000	8568000	www.hordehouse.com. It's the
8568000	8570000	other show that I'm on on
8570000	8572000	VOG Network that debuts Wednesdays
8572000	8574000	here at VOG.
8574000	8576000	I will say this about World
8576000	8578000	of Warcraft. And I've said
8578000	8580000	this many times on Horde House. The
8580000	8582000	game that will kill World of
8582000	8584000	Warcraft is
8584000	8586000	World of Warcraft. That's right.
8586000	8588000	That's gonna be the thing that kills World
8588000	8590000	of Warcraft is itself. Because
8590000	8592000	this is the type of thing that inevitably happens.
8592000	8594000	What's killing Diablo 3?
8594000	8596000	Question mark.
8596000	8598000	Itself. So
8598000	8600000	I think the only thing that's gonna
8600000	8602000	really kill World of Warcraft is itself.
8602000	8604000	Not that that's never gonna happen.
8604000	8606000	I mean the steam's gonna run out someday.
8606000	8608000	And I guess maybe I
8608000	8610000	should say instead of itself I should say Blizzard.
8610000	8612000	Because whatever Blizzard's next
8612000	8614000	MMO ends up being will probably be
8614000	8616000	I mean as long as they
8616000	8618000	don't make some of the mistakes they made with Diablo 3
8618000	8620000	which I think is inevitably gonna
8620000	8622000	push back Titan or whatever this
8622000	8624000	new MMO ends up being.
8624000	8626000	I think it could have
8626000	8628000	a large impact on WoW's user
8628000	8630000	base. But I think World of Warcraft's gonna be around
8630000	8632000	for a long time to come.
8632000	8634000	Because so many people have invested so much into it.
8634000	8636000	It's just the way it is.
8638000	8640000	Anyhow. That was it.
8640000	8642000	Oh that's it. Well then you should send more
8642000	8644000	emails for next week. Mailbag
8644000	8646000	at OrangeloungeRadio.com
8646000	8648000	I wanna hear from some of you PlayStation home folks.
8648000	8650000	Give us some PlayStation
8650000	8652000	related questions and so forth.
8652000	8654000	Or I
8654000	8656000	here's a serious question
8656000	8658000	for the home people. Do you think the PlayStation
8658000	8660000	home gets a bad rap? Because there's a lot
8660000	8662000	of people that don't
8662000	8664000	take home very seriously or
8664000	8666000	don't get home. And I'm gonna open in
8666000	8668000	Liam Mill. We've been kind of those types of skeptics
8668000	8670000	on the show in the past. Because
8670000	8672000	you know home was kind of
8672000	8674000	plugged as this big
8674000	8676000	centerpiece gateway
8676000	8678000	that you know instead of like the cross
8678000	8680000	bar on your PlayStation it would be home.
8680000	8682000	You would walk into home and you would have that
8682000	8684000	you know trophy case filled
8684000	8686000	with all your trophies and so forth. And
8686000	8688000	you know maybe the way we envision home
8688000	8690000	in our mind hasn't actually been
8690000	8692000	what's executed. Do you think
8692000	8694000	your place has gotten
8694000	8696000	a bad rap? I will say
8696000	8698000	this. The community of course is wonderful
8698000	8700000	and events and things like this. And I think home
8700000	8702000	is a lot better
8702000	8704000	now than it was three years ago. And there is
8704000	8706000	a lot to unlock in there.
8706000	8708000	And fun stuff. But you know
8708000	8710000	kind of wanna throw that out
8710000	8712000	there. I wanna hear from some of you at our mailbag.
8712000	8716000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8716000	8718000	Alright.
8718000	8720000	And Black Wolf is reporting
8720000	8722000	from live within PlayStation Home that
8722000	8724000	the PlayStation Home folks agree
8724000	8726000	that Avengers was better than Dark Knight.
8726000	8728000	Thank you.
8728000	8730000	I love you all. I love you all my children.
8730000	8732000	Cause I mean
8732000	8734000	fucking Hawkeye. Sorry Hawkeye.
8734000	8736000	Or as
8736000	8738000	I've heard
8738000	8740000	one smaller child say not
8740000	8742000	Becky's son but like a seven year old
8742000	8744000	Hawkeye.
8746000	8748000	Alright.
8748000	8750000	Moving on. It's time
8750000	8752000	for us to get angsty in a segment
8752000	8754000	we call the FUs of the Week.
8754000	8756000	Why do we have a segment called
8756000	8758000	the FUs of the Week? Cause we can.
8758000	8778000	FU.
8778000	8780000	While driving to San Francisco
8780000	8782000	yesterday I was
8782000	8784000	on this little bit where the
8784000	8786000	carpool lane splits off
8786000	8788000	to sort of bypass the
8788000	8790000	rest of traffic to get to the
8790000	8792000	just past Emeryville
8792000	8794000	to get to where you pay the tolls.
8794000	8796000	And some
8796000	8798000	sixty year old Asian man
8798000	8800000	and now I normally
8800000	8802000	do not support stereotypes
8802000	8804000	but sometimes they exist for a reason.
8804000	8806000	There
8806000	8808000	has to be something that
8808000	8810000	enabled the stereotype to
8810000	8812000	exist. Why it's you know usually accepted.
8812000	8814000	Well definitely driving while Asian.
8814000	8816000	In his little Mazda
8816000	8818000	MPV
8818000	8820000	decides that he's going to change
8820000	8822000	lanes right where I am.
8822000	8824000	And as
8824000	8826000	Marissa is my witness cause she was sitting
8826000	8828000	there in the back. I beat
8828000	8830000	Luckily
8830000	8832000	she had some airbags to protect
8832000	8834000	her. I
8834000	8836000	beeped my horn. I flicked
8836000	8838000	my lights.
8838000	8840000	And definitely screamed
8840000	8842000	what the fuck are you doing?
8842000	8844000	Several times in the car.
8844000	8846000	And Becky was in the front seat. She was
8846000	8848000	a mess after
8848000	8850000	cause he ran right into where she was.
8850000	8852000	Luckily he wasn't going very quickly. We were
8852000	8854000	going at speed. I was at going
8854000	8856000	sixty five because
8856000	8858000	of the way traffic was moving. And some other guy was on my ass
8858000	8860000	so I couldn't slow down.
8860000	8862000	There was no right to merge.
8862000	8864000	And on top of that he was trying
8864000	8866000	to cross and right where the line was starting to go solid.
8866000	8868000	Moving that fast
8868000	8870000	having a collision that fast
8870000	8872000	I mean no matter what
8872000	8874000	it's lucky. I would have been
8874000	8876000	like Becky. I would have been hysterics like
8876000	8878000	I would have been me. She was just tensed up.
8878000	8880000	Oh no I would have been full on tears.
8880000	8882000	Well here's what happened.
8882000	8884000	Me when I panic I either
8884000	8886000	cry or scream.
8886000	8888000	And I opted for screaming.
8888000	8890000	You're very good at it.
8890000	8892000	So here's what happened. He basically
8892000	8894000	thankfully
8894000	8896000	I guess he
8896000	8898000	got defensive enough or something
8898000	8900000	and I honestly think that he started to pull over when I was
8900000	8902000	in his blind spot. He knocked
8902000	8904000	my passenger side
8904000	8906000	rear view mirror off.
8906000	8908000	Which I'm very pissed off about because you know I love my car.
8908000	8910000	I love the Pontiota
8910000	8912000	the rally vibe whatever we call it.
8912000	8914000	And scraped up the side of my car
8914000	8916000	I mean it's not bad damage. The car
8916000	8918000	drove perfectly fine after that.
8918000	8920000	But um
8920000	8922000	so we stopped in the little divider like right where the
8922000	8924000	lane split. So it was
8924000	8926000	we had room to move around there.
8926000	8928000	And
8928000	8930000	he comes out of his car yelling at me.
8930000	8932000	So I'm like what the
8932000	8934000	fuck dude you broke my car you
8934000	8936000	still have a mirror.
8936000	8938000	And just I was like
8938000	8940000	and he was like yelling
8940000	8942000	stuff I couldn't understand. Like please speak with
8942000	8944000	some intelligence I can't understand you.
8944000	8946000	And
8946000	8948000	his wife was definitely a lot
8948000	8950000	more reasonable than he was. And we got it worked
8950000	8952000	out and it's funny
8952000	8954000	we're both through AAA for our insurance.
8954000	8956000	So I just had to say oh he's with AAA here's his
8956000	8958000	number. Because I'm with AAA.
8958000	8960000	Oh he's got his record right now.
8960000	8962000	I've got photos because I
8962000	8964000	am like that and take photos.
8964000	8966000	Well on my
8966000	8968000	phone.
8968000	8970000	And now here's
8970000	8972000	what the stupid thing was in his little
8972000	8974000	Mazda MPV
8974000	8976000	he had mattresses
8976000	8978000	stacked right behind
8978000	8980000	their heads to block his rear view mirror.
8980000	8982000	Including blocking
8982000	8984000	his blind spot.
8984000	8986000	Which is not illegal
8986000	8988000	but definitely not safe.
8988000	8990000	And not good for his insurance.
8990000	8992000	And I have photos of it.
8992000	8994000	Because I'm kind
8994000	8996000	of an anal bitch that way.
8996000	8998000	So um
8998000	9000000	the other parts of
9000000	9002000	my F.U. now go to the California
9002000	9004000	Highway Patrol. Now the guy didn't take a
9004000	9006000	report because nobody was injured.
9006000	9008000	The cars were relatively
9008000	9010000	fine.
9010000	9012000	Well
9012000	9014000	they can
9014000	9016000	but at this point
9016000	9018000	I was just like fuck it dude I'm hungry
9018000	9020000	and I'm
9020000	9022000	and I'm you know I was
9022000	9024000	you know how I get when I get on that
9024000	9026000	verge of anxiety
9026000	9028000	where I'm just kind of shaky
9028000	9030000	and don't want to deal with shit. That was me.
9030000	9032000	So um
9032000	9034000	I stopped and
9034000	9036000	did some deep breathing and but this is
9036000	9038000	funny because we kept seeing people pulled over
9038000	9040000	the whole fucking way from Sacramento
9040000	9042000	to San Francisco and back.
9042000	9044000	The highway patrol is everywhere
9044000	9046000	we wait like 20 minutes
9046000	9048000	for them to show up.
9048000	9050000	Giving out chicken shit tickets
9050000	9052000	is serious business. Very important.
9054000	9056000	Well it's like
9056000	9058000	and I
9058000	9060000	I have to say that my defensive
9060000	9062000	driving is pretty good.
9062000	9064000	Except the thing is that I couldn't
9064000	9066000	swerve to the side because there was a wall
9066000	9068000	next to me and it would have been
9068000	9070000	worse to run into the wall
9070000	9072000	than have the dude run into me and I
9072000	9074000	I tried to speed up to get around him
9074000	9076000	which is I honestly think that
9076000	9078000	me speeding up was why the
9078000	9080000	collision wasn't worse because
9080000	9082000	and it's like his mirror was just like
9082000	9084000	tipped up just a little bit just tipped
9084000	9086000	up a little bit. Mine was gone.
9086000	9088000	Mine is somewhere in Emeryville right now.
9088000	9090000	So fuck him.
9090000	9092000	Um now
9092000	9094000	this is the other part of the fuck you.
9094000	9096000	Fuck everybody on the road who was beeping
9096000	9098000	at us and going nice job.
9098000	9100000	Didn't help when I
9100000	9102000	got out of the car either.
9102000	9104000	Keep it classy California.
9104000	9106000	Well one of the guys managed to
9106000	9108000	stop like slow down
9108000	9110000	just enough for me to go
9110000	9112000	you get out here and fix it then.
9112000	9114000	And he rolled
9114000	9116000	up his window.
9116000	9118000	Bastard.
9118000	9120000	I love it when your anger isn't directed at me.
9120000	9122000	Alright. Well it's
9122000	9124000	just
9124000	9126000	I don't you know I don't get
9126000	9128000	and you know the lady at Allstate
9128000	9130000	she was like oh it's always the people who
9130000	9132000	were at fault that do the yelling. You mean AAA?
9132000	9134000	AAA. Yeah I called Allstate first because
9134000	9136000	I was so well when I got home I was
9136000	9138000	every time I looked over to look
9138000	9140000	in my rearview mirror and didn't see it
9140000	9142000	not there I just get pissed again.
9142000	9144000	So when I get home I'm so pissed off and shaky
9144000	9146000	and you can ask Marissa. I was pissed
9146000	9148000	off and shaky. I
9148000	9150000	went to Allstate instead of AAA.
9150000	9152000	Oops. Nice. So
9152000	9154000	I'm on the phone with freaking
9154000	9156000	Allstate and they're trying to find information for me
9156000	9158000	like wait I'm with AAA. Hang up.
9158000	9160000	Well Misty in our chat room
9160000	9162000	at live.vognetwork.com says if I find it
9162000	9164000	when I pass through Emeryville next time I'll get it back
9164000	9166000	for you.
9166000	9168000	I've got I will
9168000	9170000	share a picture from my Facebook with everyone.
9170000	9172000	Alright Loki I don't know how you're gonna follow that
9172000	9174000	but good luck. FU?
9174000	9176000	FU to
9176000	9178000	people that change up tournament rules
9178000	9180000	15 minutes before the tournament starts.
9180000	9182000	Come on. That's a little ridiculous.
9182000	9184000	Thankfully I'm patient. If my wife had it
9184000	9186000	her way I'd be
9186000	9188000	trying to get my money back.
9188000	9190000	I'd be trying to get money for the gas. I'd be
9190000	9192000	trying to deface their
9192000	9194000	website and smear them
9194000	9196000	all over all the other sites. I just
9196000	9198000	I don't I don't want to put
9198000	9200000	that much effort. Thank God Nelly wasn't in
9200000	9202000	Jamie's car. You should break off his rearview mirror.
9202000	9204000	To kind of go a little bit
9204000	9206000	with what Jamie said. FU
9206000	9208000	to people that change lanes without signaling.
9208000	9210000	And there's a lot of them.
9210000	9212000	This guy didn't signal either.
9212000	9214000	It's like dude you're like
9214000	9216000	and they were elderly people
9216000	9218000	but it's not just elderly people.
9218000	9220000	All shapes and sizes.
9220000	9222000	In my case it's elderly Asians.
9222000	9224000	But seriously I mean and the people that
9224000	9226000	are older
9226000	9228000	not necessarily elderly but like at least
9228000	9230000	in their 50s. Dude how long have you been
9230000	9232000	fucking driving? Really is the
9232000	9234000	turn signal like a new thing to you just now?
9234000	9236000	You haven't figured out how to fucking use it?
9236000	9238000	That's just sheer laziness is what
9238000	9240000	it is. And the fact that you don't signal
9240000	9242000	means probably not looking either so
9242000	9244000	you know fuck those people because
9244000	9246000	they're the ones that are dangerous out there like
9246000	9248000	not paying attention to anything
9248000	9250000	or drifting into other lanes.
9250000	9252000	I hate that too. Or when you make a
9252000	9254000	fucking left turn and the guy just like
9254000	9256000	I'm gonna take a really wide turn
9256000	9258000	so I have to go into like the median just to get
9258000	9260000	away from the guy. So fuck people
9260000	9262000	that just don't pay attention
9262000	9264000	on the road.
9264000	9266000	Well I'll go next.
9266000	9268000	I don't know I don't really have any traffic I've used
9268000	9270000	this week. Sorry to break form here but
9270000	9272000	I will say this. F you to the
9272000	9274000	fact that I kind of hurt my knee pretty bad
9274000	9276000	last week because in my role
9276000	9278000	that I was playing in Repo the genetic opera
9278000	9280000	I got to die three times
9280000	9282000	as three different cops. So
9282000	9284000	one of the times I died
9284000	9286000	I hit the ground pretty hard and I
9286000	9288000	kind of fucked up my knee doing that.
9288000	9290000	Maybe I should actually wear the knee pads next time
9290000	9292000	but I didn't have time when I changed my
9292000	9294000	costume to get them on because they can
9294000	9296000	kind of be a pain in the ass. So F you to the fact
9296000	9298000	that I fucked up my knee. Oops
9298000	9300000	not that music. This music. Oh yeah one other thing
9300000	9302000	F you to the hills in San Francisco
9302000	9304000	and having to walk uphill both ways.
9304000	9306000	Just saying. Through the snow. Walking from
9306000	9308000	Japan town to the Castro
9308000	9310000	L and back. Marissa
9310000	9312000	if you have any F yous.
9312000	9314000	Um this is gonna
9314000	9316000	this is gonna absolutely
9316000	9318000	shock anyone that
9318000	9320000	loves me and then you know knows me well but
9320000	9322000	I don't have that much to bitch about right now.
9322000	9324000	I know it's
9324000	9326000	those of you out there in radio land that
9326000	9328000	know me are gonna be like.
9328000	9330000	Well I mean yeah F you to that guy on the road
9330000	9332000	I mean I'm
9332000	9334000	from L.A. where you know
9334000	9336000	you know. You can't fucking
9336000	9338000	complain about anything traffic you
9338000	9340000	people are crazy in L.A. You're just
9340000	9342000	constantly in the upright position on the
9342000	9344000	road out there.
9344000	9346000	Nice. Oh yeah well I
9346000	9348000	would say F you to the gentleman I mentioned
9348000	9350000	earlier.
9350000	9352000	But I don't want to
9352000	9354000	never mind because that involves F you.
9354000	9356000	So um
9356000	9358000	but yeah so yeah F you to
9358000	9360000	bad drivers like them.
9360000	9362000	Well played.
9362000	9364000	Reminds me of a time when like one of the
9364000	9366000	first times we went out there for
9366000	9368000	I think it was
9368000	9370000	yeah it was for one of the our first E3
9370000	9372000	out there I'll never forget we were driving
9372000	9374000	I think to the Final Fantasy
9374000	9376000	concert or something like that.
9376000	9378000	Something that was on the freeway and I remember
9378000	9380000	we saw someone passing on
9380000	9382000	the right of us we were in the right lane by the way
9382000	9384000	passing on the right they were actually
9384000	9386000	off roading to pass us
9386000	9388000	on the right in the right most lane
9388000	9390000	of the freeway.
9390000	9392000	That's that's that's
9392000	9394000	that's ballsy.
9394000	9396000	All right two more stories for you guys then we're gonna
9396000	9398000	get to the Skype line at one eight seven
9398000	9400000	seven game O.L.R. but not just yet
9400000	9402000	because we have a few more stories
9402000	9404000	starting with Loki. Yes so one of
9404000	9406000	the games that's being kick started right now is
9406000	9408000	actually another Shadowrun game Shadowrun Online
9408000	9410000	and they talked a little bit more
9410000	9412000	details about their game and showed a little
9412000	9414000	bit of game play which looks pretty awesome it kind of
9414000	9416000	it's like a high res
9416000	9418000	HD version of like the top down
9418000	9420000	Shadowrun game on you know Super
9420000	9422000	Nintendo except you know the way you shine
9422000	9424000	your graphics and stuff. The game
9424000	9426000	though is gonna be kind of set up like
9426000	9428000	Guild Wars where you pay once and
9428000	9430000	basically you're
9430000	9432000	playing the game. There's no month to month fees
9432000	9434000	however of course there's gonna be like micro
9434000	9436000	transactions later on down the line if you want to
9436000	9438000	buy special things and
9438000	9440000	stuff. And also they're showing
9440000	9442000	some of the different things in there
9442000	9444000	they have a portion of the game where
9444000	9446000	okay you go these hub worlds and you get
9446000	9448000	your mission and there's a part of
9448000	9450000	the mission that requires
9450000	9452000	you to do the investigation work and
9452000	9454000	leg work and so if your leg work
9454000	9456000	isn't very good you may not know that hey
9456000	9458000	there's an easier way to get into this
9458000	9460000	you know location
9460000	9462000	in order to get this information or hey
9462000	9464000	this is gonna be heavily guarded by something
9464000	9466000	so you'll kind of you know
9466000	9468000	know a little bit about it
9468000	9470000	but
9470000	9472000	that's kind of cool. And then of course they're saying
9472000	9474000	that the game at launch is gonna
9474000	9476000	retail for $39.99 of course
9476000	9478000	if you back the Kickstarter you'll
9478000	9480000	get the game at $25
9480000	9482000	at that donation level
9482000	9484000	and
9484000	9486000	I guess a new campaign
9486000	9488000	they're gonna be launching every three to
9488000	9490000	four months for $15
9490000	9492000	so it could be kind of add on
9492000	9494000	expansions.
9494000	9496000	Sound like something you might be putting money down for?
9496000	9498000	Maybe, I mean
9498000	9500000	I've already backed one
9500000	9502000	Kickstarter Shadowrun game
9502000	9504000	so I'd be kind of curious
9504000	9506000	but once again I don't have time for MMOs
9506000	9508000	but the game sounds like
9508000	9510000	it's more
9510000	9512000	single player with other
9512000	9514000	people at the same
9514000	9516000	time kind of I don't know
9516000	9518000	you can play it single player
9518000	9520000	you can play it you know co-op
9520000	9522000	or you can do PVP
9522000	9524000	so it'll be neat
9524000	9526000	I mean I'll have to see when it comes out
9526000	9528000	I'm probably not gonna back it though. Alright
9528000	9530000	just because I've backed too much stuff recently
9530000	9532000	so. Alright one more story
9532000	9534000	for you guys before we get to the
9534000	9536000	Skype line and this has to do with
9536000	9538000	Jet Set Radio you know it's gonna be making
9538000	9540000	a renaissance pretty soon with the
9540000	9542000	Playstation Network and Xbox Live

9544000	9546000	you want some clothing inspired by the
9546000	9548000	games there's a company in the UK

9552000	9554000	clothes called Sega Reloaded

9558000	9560000	worn by Beat and Gum in Jet Set

9562000	9564000	names on them there's shirts and
9564000	9566000	hoodies based on the leather

9594000	9596000	Excuse me Sega, I don't know if it's official
9596000	9598000	but Sega inspired clothing. I just want
9598000	9600000	the N7 hoodie. That's all I want is the
9600000	9602000	N7 hoodie. Somebody get it for me.
9602000	9604000	Alright
9604000	9606000	Okay I'm getting a message
9606000	9608000	via Black Wolf from
9608000	9610000	PlayStation Home. Blender wants
9610000	9612000	to do another contest. Pick an animal
9612000	9614000	and the first person to type that animal
9614000	9616000	into the home space
9616000	9618000	wins another prize in home. So
9618000	9620000	an animal. What animal
9620000	9622000	are we going to pick? Should we go obvious?
9622000	9624000	Dark
9624000	9626000	Sakura why don't you pick for us?
9626000	9628000	What animal do you think they should type
9628000	9630000	in the home chat?
9630000	9632000	I can't tell them that though. They have to
9632000	9634000	guess right?
9634000	9636000	Pick an animal. Wait
9636000	9638000	wait are we
9638000	9640000	You're going to have to clarify.
9640000	9642000	Do we say it?
9642000	9644000	Do we say it or are they supposed to
9644000	9646000	guess? Okay yeah
9646000	9648000	Black Wolf says yes. Say it.
9648000	9650000	Lemur. A lemur.
9650000	9652000	Alright there you go.
9652000	9654000	I didn't say ferret so all you people who
9654000	9656000	were trying to get the jump know.
9656000	9658000	Alright a lemur.
9658000	9660000	Alright good luck.
9660000	9662000	Alright
9662000	9664000	Love it.
9664000	9666000	Lemurs are fucking cute okay.
9666000	9668000	Let us know who wins Bobby.
9668000	9670000	You know what else is cute?
9670000	9672000	Baby sloths.
9672000	9674000	Come on baby sloths are adorable.
9674000	9676000	So whatever.
9676000	9678000	And no Garris is not an animal.
9678000	9680000	Garris is
9680000	9682000	turian.
9682000	9684000	Alright and remember
9684000	9686000	He just said that.
9686000	9688000	I'm risking an animal
9688000	9690000	in the sack.
9690000	9692000	This is all I hear
9692000	9694000	from people that play Mass Effect so
9694000	9696000	Remember. No it's
9696000	9698000	Kayden for me.
9698000	9700000	If you talk to the gays they'll all say
9700000	9702000	Kayden.
9702000	9704000	Kayden's an ass
9704000	9706000	who actually his
9706000	9708000	model is like the guy he's modeled
9708000	9710000	after and who did all the face cap and stuff
9710000	9712000	is like a gay partender from the abbey.
9712000	9714000	And he's hot.
9714000	9716000	Oh my god.
9716000	9718000	I gotta admit he was easy on the eyes.
9718000	9720000	Alright Skull King
9720000	9722000	won of course he did.
9722000	9724000	Of course he won.
9724000	9726000	But you know what he deserves it for
9726000	9728000	for helping support the
9728000	9730000	vog
9730000	9732000	participation with Summerfest.
9732000	9734000	Lemurs lemurs cutie furry lemurs.
9734000	9736000	Alright let's move on
9736000	9738000	to the Skyplane.
9738000	9740000	I gotta open that up 1877 Game OLR
9740000	9742000	The Skyplane is open right now
9742000	9744000	for you guys to give us
9744000	9746000	a call and if you wanna call us
9746000	9748000	from Playstation Home awesome.
9748000	9750000	If you're one of our regular listeners who wants to call us
9750000	9752000	that's awesome too. We will talk to you
9752000	9754000	at 1877 Game OLR.
9754000	9756000	Meanwhile let me get
9756000	9758000	to some Twitter topics. We have a few things
9758000	9760000	that were sent to us via Twitter
9760000	9762000	and I wanna look at this from Tigerclaw
9762000	9764000	cause this tweet here from Tigerclaw just
9764000	9766000	jumps out at me it's like wah wah what?
9766000	9768000	Irrational Games
9768000	9770000	Job lists 85
9770000	9772000	plus Metacritic score as
9772000	9774000	a requirement.
9774000	9776000	This is the developer of Bioshock
9776000	9778000	and Bioshock Infinite. It's Irrational
9778000	9780000	Games. They posted a job listing
9780000	9782000	for a design manager
9782000	9784000	and apparently one of their
9784000	9786000	resume or whatever has to have a past
9786000	9788000	work that has a high score
9788000	9790000	on Metacritic. That's
9790000	9792000	kinda surprising. It's posted on the Gamasutra
9792000	9794000	job boards. Credit on at
9794000	9796000	least one game with an 85 plus
9796000	9798000	average Metacritic review score.
9798000	9800000	How do you feel
9800000	9802000	about Metacritic score having
9802000	9804000	such weight especially when you consider the games
9804000	9806000	like Child of Eden got an 84
9806000	9808000	Mirror's Edge got an 81
9808000	9810000	hmm
9810000	9812000	Remember that whole controversy over
9812000	9814000	Fallout New Vegas and the bonus they didn't get
9814000	9816000	because it was an 84?
9816000	9818000	hmm
9818000	9820000	So what's
9820000	9822000	the job requirement is that they've had to publish
9822000	9824000	or worked on the game that received
9824000	9826000	Metacritic over 85?
9826000	9828000	You have to have some credit. Alright well
9828000	9830000	let's go to the phones. What if like their co-worker
9830000	9832000	Bob just really bombed
9832000	9834000	when it came to like you know
9834000	9836000	it's like yeah we did all this really good work but man
9836000	9838000	he just like he's made fart noises
9838000	9840000	into a microphone for all the dialogue in
9840000	9842000	the game and it just
9842000	9844000	really hurt us.
9844000	9846000	Alright let's go to the phones. Hi
9846000	9848000	you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9848000	9850000	Hey it's Oscar. Hey Oscar
9850000	9852000	Thanks for sitting there waiting while
9852000	9854000	we got through that last conversation.
9854000	9856000	What's on your mind buddy?
9856000	9858000	Oh that's fine.
9858000	9860000	I just wanted to say that this past Thursday
9860000	9862000	I made the 6 hour drive
9862000	9864000	back and forth for 12
9864000	9866000	hours total to Virginia
9866000	9868000	like right outside of the DC area to see
9868000	9870000	the Zelda Symphony.
9870000	9872000	Oh my gosh you drove 12
9872000	9874000	hours to see the Zelda Symphony.
9874000	9876000	Well I went to... It was well
9876000	9878000	worth it. I went to LA to see
9878000	9880000	the Dear Friends concert so
9880000	9882000	yeah it's about the same. It was worth it?
9882000	9884000	Yeah definitely. Tell us a little bit
9884000	9886000	about the experience.
9886000	9888000	Like um I don't know did any of you guys buy
9888000	9890000	Skyward Sword and like see how they had the orchestra
9890000	9892000	CD packaged in with the game? Sadly
9892000	9894000	no I never got around to that one
9894000	9896000	sadly. Alright well like
9896000	9898000	it has like 7 or 8 or so tracks
9898000	9900000	on that CD and
9900000	9902000	it's
9902000	9904000	they played pretty much most of those but there were so
9904000	9906000	much more like they had complete like symphonic
9906000	9908000	movements in each of the game. Like there was
9908000	9910000	Ocarina of Time movement, a Twilight Princess
9910000	9912000	movement, a movement from
9912000	9914000	Link to the Past and oh my god
9914000	9916000	the friggin Link to the Past one like I
9916000	9918000	teared up at one part where they did the credits
9918000	9920000	music cause I just forgot about that.
9920000	9922000	That game is so good.
9922000	9924000	Yeah
9924000	9926000	like don't get me wrong Ocarina of Time is my
9926000	9928000	favorite but that game has some moments
9928000	9930000	so that just I don't know.
9930000	9932000	So you didn't just
9932000	9934000	go by yourself I imagine you went with friends.
9934000	9936000	Yeah I had a couple friends with me
9936000	9938000	that went like um
9938000	9940000	actually it was one of my friends who posted on Facebook
9940000	9942000	I'm buying tickets today who wants to go
9942000	9944000	and like I was one of the first people to respond
9944000	9946000	and so he bought my ticket
9946000	9948000	which was only $65
9948000	9950000	for that theater it was like the Wolf Trap
9950000	9952000	Theater near DC.
9952000	9954000	They were really good
9954000	9956000	seats actually like they were pretty
9956000	9958000	close. So you drove from
9958000	9960000	where? You live in Ohio?
9960000	9962000	Michigan? Yeah well I live
9962000	9964000	in Northeast Ohio but my friend
9964000	9966000	who bought the tickets lives down in
9966000	9968000	Athens Ohio which is like the Southeastern portion
9968000	9970000	of it so
9970000	9972000	like I had to go down
9972000	9974000	there anyway to like move stuff out of my apartment
9974000	9976000	for the next year
9976000	9978000	so it was no big deal
9978000	9980000	driving down there myself but then
9980000	9982000	he drove to DC for the most part.
9982000	9984000	Wow that's a long
9984000	9986000	drive but that's awesome
9986000	9988000	I mean sounds like it was quite the experience.
9988000	9990000	What was the crowd like?
9990000	9992000	Um
9992000	9994000	it was a mixed bag
9994000	9996000	like I thought it was going to be a lot of kids but actually
9996000	9998000	it was only a few
9998000	10000000	and like a lot of teenagers to adults
10000000	10002000	and like
10002000	10004000	the kids that were there like I saw their
10004000	10006000	dads that were with them all had their 3DS's
10006000	10008000	out like it was just a street pass fest
10008000	10010000	like just non-stop I
10010000	10012000	probably got 100 during the course of the day.
10012000	10014000	Oh my yeah you probably could have beat
10014000	10016000	find me in
10016000	10018000	one sitting there that's awesome.
10018000	10020000	Oh definitely it was
10020000	10022000	I don't know you need to go
10022000	10024000	like you really should like um
10024000	10026000	I do if they come back through here.
10026000	10028000	The last concert was in San Jose on December
10028000	10030000	14th did you try to link that one?
10030000	10032000	Is it? I might just do
10032000	10034000	that actually what day of the week is December
10034000	10036000	14th let's see the 6th is umlaut
10036000	10038000	and that says Thursday so
10038000	10040000	that sounds like it would be a Wednesday no it's a Friday
10040000	10042000	hmm maybe
10042000	10044000	that would be great.
10044000	10046000	Go to zelda-symphony.com
10046000	10048000	and there should be a link to the schedule up there
10048000	10050000	and you can check it all out. Anyone want to go?
10050000	10052000	Anyone? Anyone? Anyone?
10052000	10054000	Alright we'll see I'll find
10054000	10056000	maybe Alan will want to go we'll make it a
10056000	10058000	trip I have friends in San Jose too
10058000	10060000	Mel and Mel live there and you know them from this show
10060000	10062000	and it would be cool to go see something
10062000	10064000	like that so yeah well thanks
10064000	10066000	for the tip and I'm glad to hear you had a good
10066000	10068000	time. Yeah
10068000	10070000	I just hope that they release like
10070000	10072000	another orchestrated CD like maybe after
10072000	10074000	the tour is done because some of those songs I
10074000	10076000	just really want to hear again. I'm sure
10076000	10078000	they'll be another Zelda pre-order disc in the future.
10078000	10080000	Yeah there has
10080000	10082000	to be. Alright well
10082000	10084000	Osfer I'm going to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call

10094000	10096000	some other tweets
10096000	10098000	one more from Tigerclaw I let people have
10098000	10100000	two tweets just a kind of a quick
10100000	10102000	headline here Microsoft halts
10102000	10104000	further development on what was to be the
10104000	10106000	free-to-play game Flight
10106000	10108000	it was supposed to be a free-to-play entry
10108000	10110000	in Microsoft's Flight Simulator
10110000	10112000	franchise I wonder if that has to
10112000	10114000	do with the Vancouver layoffs we heard about earlier
10114000	10116000	well
10116000	10118000	I don't know it's
10118000	10120000	it's I like the Flight Simulator
10120000	10122000	games back in the day but I mean they're
10122000	10124000	so intricate now like I don't actually
10124000	10126000	know how to fly a plane people
10126000	10128000	but it looked fun and pretty
10128000	10130000	I remember those used to be like the graph that the
10130000	10132000	high-end graphic games with the Flight Simulator
10132000	10134000	games yes Marissa? Well I mean if you
10134000	10136000	really wanted to make them properly accurate you need to have
10136000	10138000	bitchy flight attendants
10138000	10140000	that's a real flight simulator
10140000	10142000	I want to join the Mile High Club

10192000	10194000	um
10194000	10196000	so right now the beta
10196000	10198000	that I allegedly played
10198000	10200000	very much feels like
10200000	10202000	a lifeless Smash Brothers
10202000	10204000	clone which you know
10204000	10206000	not terrible I guess but it's not
10206000	10208000	really fun yet which
10208000	10210000	I think games are supposed to be fun
10210000	10212000	last I heard why wasn't it fun?
10212000	10214000	um
10214000	10216000	because there's no charm to it yet
10216000	10218000	even having Parappa
10218000	10220000	in the beta the beta is only like six characters
10220000	10222000	um and
10222000	10224000	I've only seen two different stages so far
10224000	10226000	but there's
10226000	10228000	just I don't know it's
10228000	10230000	a boring game
10230000	10232000	and Smash Brothers to me is pretty boring to begin
10232000	10234000	with so maybe I'm biased but
10234000	10236000	I expected more you were telling
10236000	10238000	me that the beta is only multiplayer
10238000	10240000	correct? yeah I have to connect
10240000	10242000	to somebody else I can't play against computer players
10242000	10244000	now I have not tried to see if I could
10244000	10246000	play like two people on the same console
10246000	10248000	but part of the problem in the beta
10248000	10250000	right now is you know when you play Smash
10250000	10252000	Brothers and you get like every
10252000	10254000	person in like a tight area
10254000	10256000	the camera zooms in it doesn't
10256000	10258000	do that well in this game so
10258000	10260000	it doesn't matter how close you are to the action
10260000	10262000	your character is still really far away
10262000	10264000	and it can make it very hard to figure out what's going
10264000	10266000	on at any given time do you think
10266000	10268000	that might have hurt your impressions a little bit though
10268000	10270000	the fact you couldn't fuck around in single player
10270000	10272000	at all? um
10272000	10274000	no because
10274000	10276000	ideally that style of game is
10276000	10278000	just really
10278000	10280000	multiplayer based I feel like
10280000	10282000	Smash Brothers isn't fun by yourself
10282000	10284000	at all let's be real though
10284000	10286000	being able to play online multiplayer is a
10286000	10288000	feature that Smash Brothers I guess the
10288000	10290000	one on the Wii had it but it didn't do it very
10290000	10292000	well it was terrible it didn't really do it very well
10292000	10294000	but to Smash Brothers credit
10294000	10296000	and I'm not like you I like the
10296000	10298000	Smash Brothers games a lot but I
10298000	10300000	think they're bad games I just I think they're overrated
10300000	10302000	let's say that here's the thing
10302000	10304000	that what I always loved about Smash Brothers is that
10304000	10306000	they're very robust packages
10306000	10308000	like there is
10308000	10310000	so much in especially those
10310000	10312000	most recent Smash Brothers games
10312000	10314000	so many unlocks so many other modes
10314000	10316000	so many like mini games and other
10316000	10318000	things to experience you know and a lot
10318000	10320000	of that was brought into Kid Icarus too
10320000	10322000	so I think you know the projects
10322000	10324000	that that team does tend to be very
10324000	10326000	robust experiences
10326000	10328000	and I think if Sony doesn't
10328000	10330000	offer fans that same
10330000	10332000	really rich experience
10332000	10334000	which you're not going to see
10334000	10336000	in such a limited beta I think
10336000	10338000	you are going to feel short changed a little bit
10338000	10340000	well and then
10340000	10342000	one of the things I feel like they really get right
10342000	10344000	are the stages I really
10344000	10346000	like the fact that they change
10346000	10348000	and kind of mix up
10348000	10350000	different games in one stage like I was playing
10350000	10352000	a god of no I was playing
10352000	10354000	the Ratchet and Clank stage and all of a sudden
10354000	10356000	it turned into God of War which is
10356000	10358000	really cool and then
10358000	10360000	one turned into like Padapon
10360000	10362000	I don't remember which stage it also was but
10362000	10364000	I really enjoyed that feature
10364000	10366000	I just after now
10366000	10368000	I didn't know about that leaked list of characters
10368000	10370000	that people you know
10370000	10372000	datamined from the beta I'm kind of sad
10372000	10374000	that there aren't those real
10374000	10376000	robust options
10376000	10378000	that Smash Brothers offers but
10378000	10380000	I will probably get it because
10380000	10382000	I love that Dante and I will
10382000	10384000	play as him even if he's a terrible character
10384000	10386000	so despite everything you just said
10386000	10388000	about not feeling super great about it
10388000	10390000	you're going to buy it anyway
10390000	10392000	because they're adding that Dante that's really really hot
10392000	10394000	it was good enough to make you want to buy it
10394000	10396000	in the end
10396000	10398000	yes well I think it has potential and I think
10398000	10400000	you know I'm not judging
10400000	10402000	really purchasing it based on the beta
10402000	10404000	because you can tell that the
10404000	10406000	beta whatever build they're using is really
10406000	10408000	early on there's a lot of like
10408000	10410000	barren features
10410000	10412000	in it so
10412000	10414000	I don't know I just
10414000	10416000	I'm not going to hate the game yet
10416000	10418000	but it still needs to do more to wow me
10418000	10420000	I think they can pull it off though
10420000	10422000	well we'll see what happens in the coming months
10422000	10424000	hopefully there's a lot of good stuff to be
10424000	10426000	unlocked and things we haven't seen yet
10426000	10428000	and some of these characters in the leak sound
10428000	10430000	potential which by the way I think
10430000	10432000	Shane coming on here and giving his
10432000	10434000	alleged thoughts on the beta he may have allegedly
10434000	10436000	played is a whole lot less of an infraction
10436000	10438000	than whoever hacked the damn files
10438000	10440000	to pull out those unlockable characters
10440000	10442000	yeah and they had pictures of the stages too
10442000	10444000	I kind of thought those stages were neat
10444000	10446000	as the illegal secretary I approve
10446000	10448000	of your legalese ass covering
10448000	10450000	thank you
10450000	10452000	I appreciate that
10452000	10454000	I think we need to hire Marissa as a consultant for other
10454000	10456000	shows in the future
10456000	10458000	oh and Prab is awesome in it like
10458000	10460000	he's really cool
10460000	10462000	do you get to actually rap?
10462000	10464000	no but okay remember
10464000	10466000	that stupid boombox
10466000	10468000	in the game that
10468000	10470000	okay you get to throw him around
10470000	10472000	and I like that because I hate that boombox
10472000	10474000	is there a stage that's you waiting to use
10474000	10476000	the toilet?
10476000	10478000	not in the beta at least
10478000	10480000	because that was like the funniest stage from the first
10480000	10482000	Parappa game remember? I love Parappa
10482000	10484000	why won't they do another Parappa game?
10484000	10486000	I need to go just as bad as you
10486000	10488000	it seems like the perfect Playstation Network game
10488000	10490000	the perfect goldmine for Sony is a
10490000	10492000	Parappa online game
10492000	10494000	with little minisodes and stuff like that
10494000	10496000	why is Sony not doing this?
10496000	10498000	because Parappa 2 was not that
10498000	10500000	good, they should do another Umjammer
10500000	10502000	Lammy because that game was amazing
10502000	10504000	alright I'll take that, Umjammer Lammy is pretty
10504000	10506000	fucking good
10506000	10508000	I'm sad that she's not a leaked character, that would be really cool
10508000	10510000	you know there's always
10510000	10512000	DLC
10512000	10514000	I will buy Umjammer Lammy DLC
10514000	10516000	if I could get the one stage that everybody
10516000	10518000	except for me hates as
10518000	10520000	a stage you can play in the game I would be
10520000	10522000	so excited
10522000	10524000	shame before I let you go
10524000	10526000	we have a question for you from
10526000	10528000	playstation home summerfest
10528000	10530000	blackwolf in
10530000	10532000	playstation home says where is your
10532000	10534000	rhythm thief review?
10534000	10536000	in written form
10536000	10538000	no no no no no no don't spoil it here
10538000	10540000	I want it in written form
10540000	10542000	no I'm not going to spoil my review
10542000	10544000	here's the thing
10544000	10546000	my 3DS is busted
10546000	10548000	so yeah
10548000	10550000	for some reason when I hit the B button
10550000	10552000	it turns off which is usually the
10552000	10554000	function of the off button
10554000	10556000	but um
10556000	10558000	don't say Alan, I can hear Alan
10558000	10560000	laughing at what you just said all the way from the kitchen
10560000	10562000	hello
10562000	10564000	why?
10564000	10566000	because the B button is, nevermind, forget it
10566000	10568000	it sounds like you've got a short
10568000	10570000	is what it sounds like yeah it does
10570000	10572000	sometimes when I hold it funny it turns off
10572000	10574000	I'm like whatever I just don't even want to play you
10574000	10576000	um something inside there
10576000	10578000	yeah and I couldn't find a screwdriver to open up
10578000	10580000	because I would open it up
10580000	10582000	wait yes you did spill something on your 3DS?
10582000	10584000	no no no I didn't spill anything no no
10584000	10586000	did the dog try to eat it?
10586000	10588000	I've got all these tri-wing screwdrivers just sitting in my house
10588000	10590000	aw too bad he lives in Kansas
10590000	10592000	um what I was going to say is
10592000	10594000	I will probably be getting an XL
10594000	10596000	in two weeks thanks to my job
10596000	10598000	so I'll start playing it again
10598000	10600000	which we can't talk about
10600000	10602000	any further on the show but I will
10602000	10604000	talk to the other host about it off air
10604000	10606000	it's like the 3DS but
10606000	10608000	bigger
10608000	10610000	alright moving on uh
10610000	10612000	I guess that's it so when you get your
10612000	10614000	3DS situation figured out we want the review
10614000	10616000	now that it's not timely
10616000	10618000	not
10618000	10620000	my fault I can't even play
10620000	10622000	Pokemon do you know what a like a
10622000	10624000	pain that is to me we really need more
10624000	10626000	written content at VoG and granted I'm
10626000	10628000	responsible for this too but I mean
10628000	10630000	I've just had so much going on this week
10630000	10632000	um but uh yeah if you have some time
10632000	10634000	and you're interested in writing for VoG
10634000	10636000	it doesn't have to be about video games it could be anything
10636000	10638000	geeky movies books I would love
10638000	10640000	somebody who reads a lot of books
10640000	10642000	and even comic books and manga
10642000	10644000	I bought a book Rob
10644000	10646000	I bought um one of the Vampire
10646000	10648000	Hunter D novels that I hadn't read yet
10648000	10650000	it doesn't have to be geeky books because my wife reads a lot of books
10650000	10652000	but I mean like right now she does read
10652000	10654000	a lot of geeky books she reads a lot of
10654000	10656000	you know what your wife
10656000	10658000	is hilarious so yes I don't
10658000	10660000	care what it is she should do book reviews
10660000	10662000	I should say this funny enough
10662000	10664000	I'm seeking a book review
10664000	10666000	I actually am doing one for
10666000	10668000	a friend site of VoG
10668000	10670000	I'm just not done with the book yet but
10670000	10672000	it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out who
10672000	10674000	but I'm hoping to have that done with him next week
10674000	10676000	This is Fifty Shades of Grey
10676000	10678000	It is not Fifty Shades of Grey
10678000	10680000	Then you need to redo your review
10680000	10682000	We're like Fifty Shades of Shit
10682000	10684000	Fifty Shades of I'm Hanging Up On You Bye
10684000	10686000	Bye
10686000	10688000	Alright
10688000	10690000	Oh lordy how about one more call
10690000	10692000	I don't think he mentioned Mass Effect at all
10692000	10694000	He didn't
10694000	10696000	That's awesome
10696000	10698000	Gotcha Shane
10698000	10700000	Hi you're on Orange Launch Radio
10700000	10702000	Who's this?
10702000	10704000	This is Azoramay
10704000	10706000	Say that one more time?
10706000	10708000	Azoramay? Azoramay? What's on your mind tonight?
10708000	10710000	I just wanted to
10710000	10712000	I just noticed that
10712000	10714000	there's going to be like a Final Fantasy 11
10714000	10716000	like revival
10716000	10718000	of music
10718000	10720000	concert going on in your area
10720000	10722000	and I was just wondering if you were aware of that
10722000	10724000	I am very aware of that and I
10724000	10726000	kind of sort of want to go actually
10726000	10728000	it's just about you know if I can convince
10728000	10730000	somebody else to go with me so I don't have to go
10730000	10732000	by myself but yeah it's in Berkeley
10732000	10734000	they're doing like a Final Fantasy 11
10734000	10736000	You know what's funny? When I signed back up for the game
10736000	10738000	about a month ago like I got those emails right away
10738000	10740000	and then that's the log on message
10740000	10742000	I don't know if everybody sees that or I just see it
10742000	10744000	because I'm in the area
10744000	10746000	but when I log into the game it says don't forget
10746000	10748000	you have tickets on sale now for the Final Fantasy 11
10748000	10750000	event in Berkeley!
10750000	10752000	That is so funny because
10752000	10754000	I'm a fan of it
10754000	10756000	but I haven't really logged on it for a while
10756000	10758000	I mean I got a letter
10758000	10760000	via email about it
10760000	10762000	I was really thinking about going
10762000	10764000	but I'm on the East Coast in New York
10764000	10766000	and I actually went to go see
10766000	10768000	the
10768000	10770000	Distant Worlds at the Brooklyn Academy of Music
10770000	10772000	and it was really great
10772000	10774000	but like I said I have the same problem
10774000	10776000	as you do trying to convince
10776000	10778000	friends to actually go ahead and see it
10778000	10780000	it's like a once in a lifetime
10780000	10782000	opportunity
10782000	10784000	Would you think they're
10784000	10786000	going to bring it out here at all?
10786000	10788000	It really depends on this first one and if it does
10788000	10790000	well that's kind of the deal if it makes money
10790000	10792000	it'll tour
10792000	10794000	Here's something else to consider
10794000	10796000	we're going back years and years
10796000	10798000	so you can't really judge what's going on
10798000	10800000	at Square now to these standards
10800000	10802000	but when that first Dear Friends concert
10802000	10804000	happened which was what? That was the first year
10804000	10806000	I went to E3 so that was what? 04 I think?
10806000	10808000	04 or 05? It was 04
10808000	10810000	was Dear Friends
10810000	10812000	and that Dear Friends concert
10812000	10814000	was so good and so well received
10814000	10816000	and so amazing and that
10816000	10818000	in turn had been inspired by that
10818000	10820000	what was it? It was the 222
10820000	10822000	2002 concert they had in Japan
10822000	10824000	that had the CD
10824000	10826000	it did so well that they took that around
10826000	10828000	the country and it was a
10828000	10830000	good show and they took it to a lot of
10830000	10832000	big cities however the next year
10832000	10834000	they did a new show called More Friends
10834000	10836000	that was at the Gibson Amphitheater
10836000	10838000	I think at Universal Studios
10838000	10840000	and I went to that as well because I
10840000	10842000	loved the first one so much and More Friends
10842000	10844000	wasn't good I mean
10844000	10846000	it's not really the fault
10846000	10848000	I don't want to fault the musicians
10848000	10850000	I don't want to fault the guest stars
10850000	10852000	I don't want to fault the talent behind it
10852000	10854000	but just the production of it was
10854000	10856000	really not good and a lot
10856000	10858000	of that was acoustic problems
10858000	10860000	and a lot of the sound problems
10860000	10862000	and there was a lot of live issues and I heard
10862000	10864000	you know I don't know how much truth
10864000	10866000	there is to this stuff but I heard some dude
10866000	10868000	got fired on the spot by Nobui
10868000	10870000	Matsu for how freaking terrible
10870000	10872000	More Friends was and
10872000	10874000	Oh really? Wow I didn't know that
10874000	10876000	They didn't take that on tour
10876000	10878000	So it was like a once in a
10878000	10880000	lifetime event
10880000	10882000	Yes I can say it was a once
10882000	10884000	in a lifetime event that I got to go to and
10884000	10886000	I do consider myself lucky even though it was a bad
10886000	10888000	show they actually had like the
10888000	10890000	and I forget her name maybe you know it
10890000	10892000	the lady from Final Fantasy 10 who sang
10892000	10894000	that
10894000	10896000	I can't remember the name of the song
10896000	10898000	I'm sorry I can't say it again
10898000	10900000	Thank you
10900000	10902000	Yeah she was there singing it
10902000	10904000	and so to hear that live was really
10904000	10906000	amazing but that's
10906000	10908000	you know and so I'm thankful
10908000	10910000	for moments like that but
10910000	10912000	I realize you know
10912000	10916000	overall unfortunately the show was not a success
10916000	10918000	Oh okay well I mean that's kind of like
10918000	10920000	all I really had to
10920000	10922000	really ask Hey no it's a great question
10922000	10924000	I'm tempted I will say
10924000	10926000	I'm very very tempted we'll see I'll let you know
10926000	10928000	what I end up deciding
10928000	10930000	Alright thank you Alright take care

10982000	10984000	we're getting close to the end of the party
10984000	10986000	at Summerfest and Playstation Home
10986000	10988000	last call last call everybody
10988000	10990000	before we close
10990000	10992000	out tonight I'm gonna ask
10992000	10994000	Loki if he has any last minute stories
10994000	10996000	nope wow
10996000	10998000	I didn't even look
10998000	11000000	shame on you
11000000	11002000	I couldn't think of anything that we didn't cover
11002000	11004000	that was really really big
11004000	11006000	I do have one of the tweet I will read that
11006000	11008000	and that was from actdeft and it also reminds me to talk about this
11008000	11010000	actdeft tweeted the show and said
11010000	11012000	played beat hazard during the
11012000	11014000	o-l-r break and start of part b
11014000	11016000	quite fun and then he linked
11016000	11018000	it on the steam community or he linked his
11018000	11020000	picture on the steam community
11020000	11022000	this was something I posted on the vog network
11022000	11024000	forums if you're a fan of the game
11024000	11026000	beat hazard and you have it on pc
11026000	11028000	it is very easy to
11028000	11030000	mod the game and it's not like
11030000	11032000	you're not doing a bad thing you are editing
11032000	11034000	text files to the developers like put instructions
11034000	11036000	on how to edit it in there
11036000	11038000	you can actually add your own internet
11038000	11040000	radio feeds cause beat hazard you can play the
11040000	11042000	internet radio and it's very easy to add
11042000	11044000	vog network as a radio feed
11044000	11046000	so yes you could play beat hazard
11046000	11048000	to my voice
11048000	11050000	but it's you know when there
11050000	11052000	is no live or taped program on
11052000	11054000	the voice of geeks network there is a music
11054000	11056000	feed so it's really meant for that
11056000	11058000	but some people are playing along to our voices which I think
11058000	11060000	is kind of funny too so uh you can do
11060000	11062000	that marathon mode
11062000	11064000	so if you like yell something really fast
11064000	11066000	or something that gets harder is that yes yes
11066000	11068000	anti-disestablishmentarianism
11068000	11084000	I actually do know what it means
11084000	11086000	swear in Jewish frantically there might
11086000	11088000	be a there might be a boss
11088000	11094000	God that's hot
11094000	11096000	you know it's funny that people think like oh you're Jewish
11096000	11098000	you must have like grown up learning this no I know
11098000	11100000	because I grew up in Los Angeles
11100000	11102000	you know
11102000	11104000	nice
11104000	11106000	alright um
11106000	11108000	if you need more information on how to mod that
11108000	11110000	I posted something on our forums if you're not registered

11260000	11262000	Adams Wednesday happens to be
11262000	11264000	August 1st
11264000	11266000	happens to be when the 3rd gate opens
11266000	11268000	oh shit the race is on
11268000	11270000	do you have time off from work to do it?
11270000	11272000	I took the day off well for multiple reasons I took the day off
11272000	11274000	to take Josh
11274000	11276000	cause it's his second
11276000	11278000	birthday but also
11278000	11280000	because I'm going to be staying up all night long finishing
11280000	11282000	whatever game they have
11282000	11284000	same reason I took
11284000	11286000	September 25th off work
11286000	11288000	understandable
11288000	11290000	I hope
11290000	11292000	the game is not hard enough
11292000	11294000	for me where I can't finish it in one night
11294000	11296000	cause I'm going to be disappointed if
11296000	11298000	I have to stop
11298000	11300000	playing to sleep or
11300000	11302000	do other things
11302000	11304000	but um
11304000	11306000	I don't know
11306000	11308000	who knows what it is no one knows I just hope it's not a crappy
11308000	11310000	Facebook game please not be a crappy Facebook
11310000	11312000	game cause that was already a
11312000	11314000	crappy Facebook game for Gate 2 and I
11314000	11316000	can't take another one I will just say
11316000	11318000	I will throw over a table and just say fuck it
