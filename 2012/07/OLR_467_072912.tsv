79590	85775	I had many, many amaretto sours and raspberry vodka with cranberry sauce.
85875	87396	Cranberry juice.
87776	88317	Gross.
89417	94201	And mudslides and other things that people just put in front of me and said, here, drink this.

151539	152319	How are you, Marissa?
152339	153320	I'm great, how are you?
153640	155061	I am fantastic.
155161	157302	Thank you so much for coming back to Orange Lounge Radio.
158322	161704	For those who don't remember, all you need to see are her boobies.
161744	164565	They are very nice breasts.
164605	168567	And I don't mean to sound like a pig or whatever, but, I mean, seriously, girl.
168587	171649	They entered the room before me.
171909	176811	Don't forget to talk right into that microphone because it's not very sensitive, unfortunately, so they can barely hear you.
176851	178372	It's not nearly as sensitive as Robb.
180757	181377	Why am I not?
181478	181938	I'm not here.
182018	183139	Is the mic on over there?
183199	185300	I don't know.
185340	186861	It's like very quiet for some reason.
187321	188502	Why don't you just pick up Loki's mic?
189142	189523	Hello?
189563	189843	Hello?
190924	191224	Hello?
191324	191724	Is that better?
192004	192404	Much better.
192464	193225	Now I can actually hear you.
193645	193905	All right.
193945	194566	How are you, Marissa?
194726	195186	I'm great.
195246	195707	Thank you.
195767	197147	Despite the technical failure.
197167	203051	Why don't you tell the boys and girls listening at home and in PlayStation Home, which I'll get to in a minute.
203131	203812	I haven't forgot you guys.
203832	205733	Why don't you tell them about yourself real quick?
207147	213668	Well, I'm a music geek, singer-songwriter and collector of vinyl and all sorts of music.
213949	218369	And I also, as far with regard to gaming, I'm an adventure game geek.
218989	223370	Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and King's Quest and things as such.
223410	232272	I'm not really that up to date with the modern stuff, but there have been some recent, not that recent, but adventure games, you hear a little blip about them every now and again.
232372	239461	They're having a nice little renaissance thanks to a lot of the stuff that Telltale's been doing and the indie community especially has been very big on this.
239521	244527	I know there was the King's Quest fan thing, the silver lining, which was really awesome.
244887	246809	The fan community is just great for that stuff.
246829	247490	That was great.
247750	247931	Yeah.
248631	252452	So actually I came up here specifically to see this band, Prylosis.
253232	256373	And if anybody's in Sacramento, I highly recommend that you check them out.
256413	257133	They're a metal band.
257393	259694	They're also actually hilarious.
259754	260954	They have a great YouTube channel.
260974	265315	It's P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S.
265695	268116	And that's also Prylosis.com.
268176	272777	And for anybody that's into metal music, I just had to recommend them because that was a lot of fun and they're fantastic.
273697	275878	But that's more music geekery for me.
276198	279360	That's no problem because now the network is about everything geek.
279420	280360	It's Voice of Geeks.
280781	283082	So a little music geekery on our show.
283382	285943	It's a-okay, especially for metal fans.
287244	291306	You know, I'm not even actually a metal fan by nature, but I really enjoyed it.
291486	299111	They're really melodic, and it's just amazing, though, how one can expand your horizons, especially when it involves people that are really musically gifted.
300071	301892	You do a lot of music playing yourself, right?
302052	304394	I do a little bit of singer-songwriter stuff.
305054	308096	Bitching about ex-boyfriends with an acoustic guitar and stuff like that.
308356	310077	So you're like a Lilith Fair, basically.
310618	314620	Not that bad, but... I'm doing a lot of jazz covers recently.
314640	316461	I have a guitar player, and it's been a lot of fun.
316521	321424	I'm hanging out at this place called Kulak's Woodshed in North Hollywood, and they webcast actually live all their shows.
321724	322005	Nice.
322205	324026	And it's kind of a singer-songwriter deal as well.
324286	326568	PlayStation Home Summerfest PlayStation Home Summerfest
345985	349009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
363467	367229	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
388121	393970	I was in PlayStation Home during his show and just kind of really seeing the community.
394050	399138	It was almost like watching an episode of Cheers where people would show up.
399518	401201	Norm!
401241	402723	Everybody really seemed to know each other.
402763	403605	I thought it was really cool.
404745	433501	and I in a way I felt like an outsider but like everybody was super welcoming it was like saying hello and I was talking about VOG and people were actually pretty receptive during Bobby's show he got a caller from somebody that had like never listened to VOG before but was listening because of PlayStation Home and I just thought that was like a great cross promotional opportunity so if you are listening live and you are in PlayStation Home I do want to point out Bobby Blackwolf is in there now and he's going to be feeding me comments about
433661	434441	Thank you for watching!
452029	472287	of course if you want to do things the old fashioned way nothing wrong with that I'm not going to ignore you guys in our always present chat room live.vognetwork.com is where the traditional IRC based chat room is if you want to join that and chat along with the show you can also check in to the show at VOG Network as we are live here and get your VOG points and maybe a little bit of loot
473448	473708	All right.
474469	482253	Stan in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com starts us off tonight saying, Rob, is there a way to stream the live podcast on PlayStation Home?
482534	483854	Because I'll switch if I can.
484135	491099	You know, sadly, I don't think that's something that's possible yet because I don't think you can really do like streaming music or any of that yet.
491579	499265	We should all let Sony know that's something we want in the future though because how awesome would it be if in that VOG Network clubhouse we could actually have like a VOG Network feed.
499305	500726	That would be like the best thing ever.
501227	502227	So who knows?
502267	503428	Anything's possible in the future.
503849	510954	So Blackwolf is reporting that from PlayStation Home that the club channels just died again.
511354	513476	Our party is crashing the servers, y'all.
514657	515758	Do we know how to party or what?
519419	524560	Anyhow, so yes, again, a big hello to you guys at PlayStation Home who are listening tonight.
524800	526821	Let me throw out some names I remember from before.
527381	537523	MandaPanda, Jay, Steven, Junebug, that guy who had the 91 on the back of his shirt that made me feel insignificant.
537643	538123	No, just kidding.
538483	542824	But yeah, I want to say hi to all you guys who are listening right now.
543956	569566	all right um and also some of the uh OL Army and VOG regulars are in home summer fest right now I saw Tiger Claw in there earlier and I saw um Spaznator and some of the other people so that's pretty cool there's kind of the cross promotion stuff going on so that's what it's all about it's just promoting community and and cool people meeting other cool people I know PlayStation Home has had its share of you know some people still don't get it and I even admit I I've
570026	570666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
600509	600749	All right.
603050	611154	Before we get started with tonight's show, I wanted to do a quick kickoff topic, which I think might have been just saying hello to Marissa and interviewing her a little bit.
612515	613435	Let's see, Marissa.
613995	615456	So you like adventure games.
615716	615996	Yes.
616657	618417	What is your favorite video game ever?
619618	622199	It really does have to be Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.
622399	623920	I really just love that game.
623940	625201	Do you have a thing for Harrison Ford?
625261	625661	Let's be real.
626249	627851	No, but I have a thing for fedoras.
627931	629073	I really do.
629553	630895	Damn, I left mine out in the car.
631416	632177	No, true story.
633038	641149	One of my other passions besides like internet radio and video games and all that, I have been a member of like live shadow casting for midnight movies like Rocky Horror Picture Show especially, right?
641489	641870	For like
642690	643030	12 years.
643370	652273	Well, lately I've started doing stuff with Repo the Genetic Opera, which is, you know, one of the, yeah, that's kind of, I hate, I hate calling it the new Rocky Horror because it's not.
652373	656555	It's just a new, cool phenomenon that also happens to be at midnight.
656575	658055	Delays in shadow casting.
658135	658635	Exactly.
658815	660756	It's kind of like the shadow casting thing of the now.
661356	667858	And last night they did the 80s Repo show and I got to do Indiana Jones in a special cameo, which was awesome.
669058	669859	Did you bring your whip?
669879	670299	No.
671749	697976	They did a joke where the Paris Hilton character, Amber Sweet, is kind of like a dominatrix So they did a joke where I came out as Indiana Jones and she stole my whip That was kind of the joke, which was super cute But the audience cheered and I felt hot Awesome It was a good time Anyhow, let's get to video games Speaking of games, I know where to start this week Loki, I want to talk to you for a minute
698516	705319	Alright, so, you've been talking for weeks about this contest, this competition you were going to be at this weekend.
705740	706520	Let's hear about it.
706560	707120	How did it go?
707260	707901	It was terrible.
709442	710683	Okay, what was this that you went to?
710723	713745	Okay, so I went to a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 contest.
713765	714805	It was going to be two on two.
715806	722430	And, you know, for a while I was trying to find someone to go with and I had my, one of my friend's brothers was going to go with me.
723410	726512	And so everything sounded cool because he plays a lot of, you know, Call of Duty.
726812	729794	I, you know, I play quite a bit and, you know,
730495	731856	The rules were a little weird.
731956	737082	It was basically custom classes, but there were certain restrictions on what kind of loadout you can have.
737543	738104	And that was fine.
738184	746594	I practiced with the loadout that I could work with in the rules of the tournament.
746934	748516	And so I was kind of ready.
748536	749417	I had everything set up.
750802	752262	Okay, so here comes Friday.
753442	754663	The Friday before the tournament.
755863	760804	Literally about 2 o'clock, my co-op partner drops out.
762164	763044	So I have no one to go with.
763604	765004	So I'm like, fantastic.
765164	768965	Okay, so I call my friend Sean.
769145	772166	I'm like, hey, does your other brother play?
772386	774226	And he's like, yeah, he plays.
775286	776066	Let me see if he can go.
777166	778407	No, he's got things he's doing.
778607	779407	Okay, fine.
780687	781608	All right, that's fine.
781888	789474	I'll just find someone to play with when I go down there, or I'll play one against two.
789955	790755	That should be okay.
791156	792176	I'll take them both on.
792317	794578	Exactly, with the loadout I had.
794839	796740	These guys are going to all be, what, 16?
796960	797601	I'll take them all.
798541	825120	So I drove down there, like an hour and a half down to Stockton And so I'm at the shopping center where this place is and I can't find it at first So I look up on Facebook because this plaza is actually on both sides of the street I'm like, oh, it's probably on the other side of the street, let me just look up where it's at So when I go to look it up, I notice that there's an update in the events Oh, by the way, we changed all the rules
826506	827447	Oh, how convenient!
827467	828007	Thank you!
828127	828867	How convenient!
828927	833350	So they're all, oh, by the way, now we're not doing custom classes, we're just doing the standard classes that are there.
834490	835511	And with no restrictions.
835631	838592	I'm like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
838933	840233	I drove all the, I'm like, fine.
840353	840814	You know what?
840974	842835	I drove all this way, I'm gonna play at least.
843635	845116	So I get there, sign up and everything.
845196	847357	Oh, by the way, now we're gonna not do killstreaks.
848530	849090	Thanks for watching!
863394	865817	Thanks for watching!
885399	894234	I had been practicing with a certain class all week long per expectations to a tournament and then they fucking switched it all up on me so I'm like god damn it I don't know what fucking class I'm going to play.
894557	896219	And did they ask you, you mad, brah?
896439	897880	Oh, no, oh, it gets better than that.
898100	898481	It gets better.
899061	900342	I'm like, okay, so what the hell?
900482	901924	Why do you guys change the instructions?
902184	908109	Oh, well, it's actually supposed to be standard classes all along, but that's what we've been telling everybody that's been coming in here, you know, the past few weeks.
908790	917498	Oh, the past few weeks, so you've known about this shit, and you've been telling everybody, oh, but you fucking failed to update it on Facebook so that, you know, people that were coming out of town would know anything about it.
918058	922182	Well, I don't know, I'm just working here.
922282	923843	It was a big fucking mess.
924644	929328	So yes, I didn't enjoy myself, but at least I didn't spend that much time in Stockton.
929408	935574	So I played for a few minutes, I got to meet with my customer that was down there, and I left, and that was it.
936366	957308	DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the rage gauge is nearing critical DJ Morpheus is counting the number of F-bombs that you're dropping I do want to remind, because we do have an influx of new listeners tonight thanks in large part to the PlayStation Home Summerfest I just want to remind everybody it is a mature audiences show so please put the kids to bed or put headphones on
957893	958734	Let's be honest.
958794	959375	I mean, come on.
959455	962238	I mean, there's people that I've been to video game tournaments before.
962599	965923	You don't go to a tournament that changes the fucking rules.
965943	966704	Nah, that's messed up.
966744	968325	Like 10 minutes before the tournament starts.
968446	974613	Like back in the day, if it was like a DDR tournament, like, oh man, that tournament would have been smeared on DDR Freak the next day.
975437	976577	The next day?
977098	977738	The same day.
978018	978638	The same day.
979138	980259	It was ridiculous.
980459	982679	We didn't have live blogging back in that day.
982740	984420	But we had laptops at tournaments.
985000	989482	But see, no one else was pissed there except for me because everybody else there was local.
989582	993643	And so they had been in the shop at least a couple times before tournaments started.
993683	996004	So they were aware of the change in the rules.
996324	998565	But no one fucking mentioned it at all.
999605	1000866	It was really annoying.
1001166	1001606	But whatever.
1001646	1002066	You know what?
1003247	1004567	I contemplate.
1004587	1007809	I'm like, do I really want to drive down to Stockton since it's just going to be myself?
1008189	1013411	I do want to point out, Wicked is in our chat room right now saying, yay, Loki was in my neck of the woods.
1014391	1016732	So you are bashing one of our listeners' hometowns right now.
1016752	1017393	But let's be real.
1018073	1020274	Dude, bro, you live in Stockton.
1020974	1021774	You know what, though?
1021894	1023114	Your city's bankrupt.
1024375	1025035	Let me put it this way.
1025835	1029696	At least the tournament seemed like a good portion of Stockton.
1030216	1032516	The shopping mall was actually pretty nice.
1033376	1035657	A compliment from Loki, everybody!
1035877	1037357	The mall was nice!
1037397	1039237	Was it by the S-Mart?
1039717	1043138	I don't know where the S-Mart is.
1043238	1044438	And the game store was nice.
1044538	1047799	It's just, unfortunately, you have an idiot running your goddamn tournaments.
1047839	1048699	That's the only problem.
1049065	1055666	And I don't know, it may very well be that this guy's new to running tournaments because I hear that their fighting game tournaments run okay.
1056167	1058367	But then again, I'm sure they're not switching up the rules.
1058427	1059467	It'd be funny.
1059687	1063408	Hey, let's go play Marvel vs. Capcom 3 tournament.
1063488	1072610	Oh, and the reason, too, the reason that they changed up all the rules is because, oh, well, we didn't want someone to say, oh, well, the only reason you won is because you got this kill streak and the helicopter killed me.
1072870	1075171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1096440	1101883	to change the rules at the very last second because, oh, we don't want to hear someone bitch and whine.
1101903	1102304	Well, you know what?
1102324	1109308	You're fucking hearing me bitch and whine about it now because I had to drive 90 fucking minutes to your stupid tournament, which I will.
1109588	1115912	Oh, and by the way, I love my customer, but she's like, so are you coming back for Stockton Fest?
1115932	1118453	I'm like, no, I'm not fucking coming back to Stockton Fest.
1118734	1120635	I am not driving to Stockton ever again.
1122734	1125855	When I drive to LA, I will drive around Stockton.
1125875	1128635	The last time I went to Stockton, someone stole my Xbox.
1128835	1131736	This time I went to Stockton, fucking tournaments sucked.
1131876	1133536	I'm not coming back to Stockton.
1134557	1136497	There will not be a three strike law here.
1136557	1138158	This is two strikes, we're done.
1138338	1139638	I'm not going back to Stockton.
1140898	1144439	Wicked in our chat says, trust me, if I didn't have to live here, I wouldn't.
1146152	1159075	Hey, trust me, I'm sure, it's just, it has nothing to do with Stockton, this could have been run in Sacramento and had an idiot running tournament, it doesn't matter, it's just, you don't fucking change the rules at the last second.
1160603	1165107	And okay, if you're going to change the rule, I can understand if it was like, hey, you know what, you guys?
1165708	1172353	We said all these restrictions are in place, but we're just going to lift the restrictions now.
1172634	1180700	Okay, that's not so bad because I can still play with the class I had or I can change it up a little bit instead of, oh, by the way, now you have to stick to one of these six classes.
1181081	1186025	Oh, and that sucked and you can at least get some killstreaks and stuff, but we're going to take those away too.
1186864	1190727	Wicked in our chat room says, Aw, you won't come back to Stockton?
1190787	1192108	Not even if I bake cookies?
1192568	1192748	No.
1194029	1194189	No.
1194990	1195230	Sorry.
1195630	1195950	I'm sorry.
1195970	1199653	With his luck, he'd probably get food poisoning and vomit all over the entire town.
1199673	1204396	We're gonna have to broker like a Loki Stockton peace summit in like Lodi or something.
1206112	1206532	I don't know.
1206572	1208273	We're going to have to figure that one out.
1208313	1208753	All right, look.
1209193	1210434	Too many local jokes.
1211274	1212735	It's a worldwide show.
1213035	1222759	The rule, I mean, just the lesson to be learned here is just you got to be, I guess you have to be aware of how the, whatever local store is running a tournament, how they handle things.
1223040	1226361	Because, I mean, and honestly, no one should be changing rules last second.
1226421	1231043	I noticed they deleted the event on Facebook so no one can comment on it or anything.
1233064	1234965	They must have had a few angry people.
1236005	1236545	Who won?
1237506	1238046	I don't care.
1238226	1239306	I wasn't going to stick around.
1239346	1240486	I'm like, who cares?
1240926	1242367	I felt bad for the guy that was playing.
1242547	1245328	I'm like, well, because it's like the second game.
1246168	1251909	Basically, it was... Oh, and that was the other thing they changed, too, because it was single elimination first, and then it was like, oh, best two out of three now.
1252729	1254450	I'm like, is it best two out of three or single elimination?
1254490	1257371	Well, it's best two out of three, then if you lose once, then you're out.
1257951	1258711	Okay, fine.
1258911	1260072	What?
1260212	1261433	That doesn't even make sense.
1261773	1267817	Whoever loses the best two out of three or wins the best two out of three moves on, then the loser is done.
1268377	1274882	So we lost our first round because it was like, okay, let's try to get ahead.
1275142	1276022	And we were doing all right.
1276203	1278564	I mean, it wasn't like we lost by a whole ton.
1280205	1286389	It's still quite a few points, but it wasn't like we had 100 points and they had 2,500 or something.
1287030	1287950	It was pretty decent.
1289811	1292913	Yeah, we had already lost our first game, so that put us at a disadvantage for the second round.
1292933	1298455	Because the second round, it's like, well, we have to come to them because they're not, you know, in order to win this.
1298535	1301056	And so it just, unfortunately, we had the advantage there.
1301236	1303457	All right, we have a comment coming out of PlayStation Home.
1303777	1305297	The man Bobby Blackwolf is in.
1305337	1308859	He does the show before us Sunday nights on VOG Network.
1308919	1313360	He is in PlayStation Home right now feeding me comments because I can't see the TV.
1313400	1313961	It's too far away.
1314041	1314821	I'm in there doing the running.
1314841	1317002	A circle of running men just sounds dirty too.
1337711	1339232	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1358614	1359695	Ew, Zynga game.
1360716	1361116	Whatever.
1361157	1361937	Judging you.
1362378	1362858	Whatever.
1362938	1363959	No, I know it's popular.
1364139	1364920	It's real popular.
1364980	1366301	I don't care if it's popular.
1366361	1367042	It's addicting.
1367202	1368743	I've been playing a really addictive game.
1368783	1373107	I mean, I'm like cutting and talking about something in my week real quick, but I've been playing... Well, no, this is important.
1373927	1377891	I've been playing... When don't I ever make a topic about me, DarkSakura?
1377911	1378872	Even though I've been, what, 10 years?
1379272	1379532	All right.
1380113	1380693	More than that.
1382415	1384637	There's a game on iPhone called SongPop.
1385217	1385377	Zynga
1400554	1401915	How long before Zynga buys them?
1424042	1437058	Let's talk about Facebook real quick Facebook, in case anyone hasn't fucking noticed is a little broken right now because you cannot unsubscribe from people's comments and likes or updates by games
1438141	1438681	I try.
1438942	1441803	I don't fucking care about your stupid song game or whatever.
1442064	1444785	I'm trying to hide that shit, but Facebook does not want to let me do it.
1444805	1445426	You know what's funny?
1445586	1447627	I thought I set all that shit to private.
1448027	1449488	Like, are you seeing my song pop shit?
1449528	1450149	No, other people.
1450449	1450729	Oh, okay.
1450749	1450969	Bobby.
1454771	1456652	I don't mind that kind of stuff.
1456712	1459994	It's mainly people commenting on other people's cat photos.
1460094	1462456	I really don't care if you think that's a cute cat or not.
1464076	1467958	It's Facebook's problem because all that stuff was hidden before and now it's not.
1468479	1473882	I just want to make it known that this is an issue so everybody can also make it known to their friends that this is an issue because...
1475142	1476083	No one seems to be fixing it.
1476143	1477103	It's been like this for a week.
1477223	1480985	I think the real issue is that I heard this went into place a couple weeks ago.
1481045	1485367	Let's say you're in a group and you make a post in that group.
1485747	1488868	Now you can see when everybody read that post.
1490129	1492190	I kind of think that's like a privacy violation.
1493190	1494111	Surprise!
1494231	1496852	I want to be able to stalk people with impunity.
1497512	1498252	Exactly!
1498673	1500593	I can see that too with messages.
1500754	1502754	Direct messages that you send to people on Facebook.
1502834	1504035	You can see if they've read it or not.
1505373	1508539	Whatever happened to good old-fashioned anonymous ignoring you?
1510242	1514089	How are people going to be able to check in on their ex and then be upset if they're living a nice life?
1514338	1517019	It's just like those emails with read receipts and stuff like that.
1517139	1519160	I love deleting those before they get sent.
1520640	1521280	That's terrible.
1521460	1527803	Well, actually, I have to bitch about Facebook, too, because they're totally fucking over page owners right now.
1528283	1537406	I understand that they're a for-profit entity and they have to make money, but I operate several pages myself for musicians and one for a venue that I work for.
1539437	1541038	That mic is cutting in and out.
1541238	1541938	Sorry about that.
1542198	1543159	Live radio, kids.
1543659	1546920	Love ya.
1548361	1552142	I operate several pages for musicians and for venues that I work for.
1553563	1557625	I completely understand that Facebook is a for-profit entity and they need to make money.
1558005	1559866	So I'd be happy to pay for extra features.
1559926	1567369	However, to pay for just basic exposure that would normally, if you were on a friend's page, would just go out to all of your friends is bullshit.
1567409	1567829	I'm sorry.
1568209	1570651	On Facebook, you pay with your soul.
1571091	1571931	This is true.
1572011	1572592	I'm not going to argue that.
1572612	1574433	How do you like your Farmville now?
1577094	1577975	I completely agree.
1578015	1582998	But yeah, I mean, page owners, if you didn't know that already, your posts aren't getting completed.
1583018	1584839	Zuckerberg is watching you masturbate.
1585179	1585600	Shalom.
1587748	1588609	I'm allowed to say that.
1591050	1591851	For the record.
1593652	1604620	But yeah, I mean, for any page owners that didn't know this earlier, unless you're paying for their extra services, you make a post on your page, it's not going to reach your whole audience at all.
1604980	1607962	Marissa, we really just need a show on VOG where we giggle for an hour.
1608062	1610164	Giggle time!
1610204	1611005	Giggle time!
1614368	1616129	Oh dear, what have I started?
1616149	1618291	Tickle Fest!
1618331	1618491	Yay!
1619752	1620072	Alright.
1620092	1621633	Ooh, I found a Garrus shirt.
1621653	1623914	Oh yeah, this was DarkSakura's gaming week at one point.
1624074	1624855	Oh, fuck all that.
1624895	1626576	I'm looking up Mass Effect t-shirts.
1626716	1633220	Actually, Jamie did introduce... I was not familiar with Mass Effect, and Jamie did introduce me to that character's glorious baritone.
1633240	1633900	He is lovely.
1634941	1636402	It's a lovely voice.
1636422	1642126	The guy that was his voice actor was on an episode of Buffy as like this real douchebag who was like this horrible character.
1642286	1642666	Oh, really?
1642846	1644547	Yeah, it was in season seven, so it doesn't count.
1644867	1646808	Did you let Garrus calibrate your heart?
1646969	1649870	He has a very nice lower register, that's all I can say.
1650231	1652312	Well, then, Marissa, I'll ask you about your gaming week.
1652332	1654473	It sounds like you got exposed to Mass Effect a little bit.
1654593	1654793	Yes.
1655894	1658376	My new wallpaper, by the way, is the Citadel smooch.
1660076	1660417	That's it?
1660697	1667621	Watching other people play Modern Warfare and then getting yelled at for stealing their bandwidth has pretty much been the rest of my gaming week.
1668782	1670043	Goddammit, are you on the internet?
1670063	1670463	Sorry.
1672574	1677075	That's like Sunday nights at OLR when Alan mistakenly downloads BitTorrents.
1677115	1678256	God damn it, are you getting porn?
1678876	1679776	I'm trying to do a show.
1681297	1683697	I'm trying to hack into our neighbor's connection.
1683878	1687399	His connection's name is Uncle Touchy's Puzzle Basement.
1687819	1689499	But I haven't been able to figure out his code yet.
1690099	1691300	It's a Pat Moswell joke.
1691700	1697742	Oh, I'm like... As long as it's WP or WBA, you can hack it pretty easy.
1697762	1698122	Oh, okay.
1699033	1699953	I can send you the link.
1699993	1701454	Lifehacker had an article on it.
1702374	1702694	All right.
1703935	1705055	We'll go move on to Loki.
1705095	1707736	Loki, how was your gaming week besides Stockton?
1708617	1710557	Hey, Stockton just was unfortunate.
1711318	1713358	I didn't even finish mine.
1714179	1714959	I thought you were done.
1716140	1716740	Fuck you.
1716820	1717740	Fuck everybody.
1718420	1718700	Bye.
1720161	1720401	All right.
1720701	1720981	You're done.
1721402	1721962	Okay, so...
1725606	1727527	I had to walk away so I wouldn't time out of home.
1728147	1731229	You said, and I quote, I've just been playing Mass Effect.
1733150	1734510	I might have played other things.
1734730	1737372	But when you say, I just played Mass Effect.
1737672	1740053	Well, I did just play Mass Effect before we left the house.
1741333	1742074	That is true.
1742274	1744915	She made it sound like just in... Oh, forget it.
1744935	1746776	I'm not having a grammar war with this woman.
1747196	1747897	Fine, lady.
1748397	1749978	How was the rest of your gaming week?
1750378	1750838	Uneventful.
1752822	1755523	She is a level 50 grammar knight, by the way.
1755543	1759564	She's a level 50 bitch right now is what she is.
1759624	1760084	No, Rob.
1760104	1760084	69.
1760204	1760545	I'm sorry.
1760605	1761645	Bitch is a subclass.
1761765	1765806	You need to put a B in a circle on the back of your shirt when you go into PlayStation Home.
1765946	1766266	All right.
1767327	1768747	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1768807	1770688	Now, do I have permission to move on to the show?
1771008	1771668	Carry on.
1771688	1772148	Carry on.
1772228	1772989	Thank you.
1773309	1773649	Thank you.
1773889	1776070	How are you enjoying hosting the Olympics, your queen?
1777750	1779671	All these countries used to be mine.
1781929	1788955	No, I have to do the proper All of these countries used to be mine We are not amused
1792285	1794026	May the odds be ever in your favor!
1813622	1814522	Thanks for watching!
1843294	1843675	FireCrotch
1858722	1860983	Then you have roasted sausage.
1861203	1867926	Hey, now, now, I used to, I have a cooling pad they put on there, but yes, before when I used to.
1868186	1868686	Icy hot?
1869526	1873948	No, a metal pad with fans in it.
1874428	1883252	Anyways, no, but when I had, before I had all the cooling modifications to it, I would burn my legs playing games on my laptop.
1883292	1886313	So yes, that's, it is possible to do that.
1886653	1915395	and it got so hot too that like I was burning my hands not touching my laptop on top of my keys it was just getting that hot I'm like okay starting to smell things burning probably should cool it off wow so yeah so I think we're good we're in a good spot now because all the other spots that I haven't drilled holes in don't really have any processors underneath them so it's probably not necessary and then played Minecraft a bit more of that that's kind of fun we just started kind of exploring the area and the new
1918280	1922942	Octocock Minecraft Scene Beta Key for LittleBigPlanet
1937108	1938930	No problem.
1940672	1943034	And that's pretty much it.
1943134	1944135	I just have a lot of stuff.
1945296	1950541	A lot of it was just hinging on cooling my laptop down so I can play more Borderlands again because it's just getting so hot.
1950561	1952403	I'm like, I don't want to break anything in there.
1953030	1953270	All right.
1953770	1955031	Well, let me talk about my gaming week.
1955471	1957331	I played Borderlands a little bit.
1957431	1960892	I was really busy during the weekend because of the shadow casting events going on this weekend.
1960912	1964813	But earlier in the week, I played Borderlands like a little more seriously this time.
1964853	1966753	I mean, not a lot, a lot.
1966793	1971375	I only probably got to like level 10 or 11, which, you know, is chump change in the scope of things.
1971455	1974695	But it gave me enough time to get a better feel for the game than what I'd played of it before.
1975095	1975716	And I like it.
1975776	1976436	It's kind of like...
1977596	1985179	I think the description of World of Warcraft as a first-person shooter is somewhat accurate, except it's not really an MMO, but you can play the multiplayer.
1985859	1991221	That was the only thing that felt a little disjointed for me, and this is going to sound negative, but it's really not.
1991301	1998884	I do really enjoy the game, you guys, but I kind of thought it was weird that you can use the same character in your single-player and in multiplayer.
1999424	2025329	I know you can use different too but it was it just felt a little disjointed like here I am doing some quests as single player and then here we are multiplayer and so-and-so's kind of off doing this and so-and-so's off doing this and kind of like we're all completing quests I'm not able to really follow along I'm not able to get into it as easy so it's kind of like I feel the need to play through this game once single player just to like know the story and know everything and then go back and do multiplayer and I
2026009	2029033	Okay, for real, GameSpy is the multiplayer client?
2029153	2029894	Like, what is this, 1998?
2033678	2036040	But okay, I realize the game is a few years old.
2037021	2041606	I'm hoping Borderlands 2 uses something a little more modern.
2041626	2041706	Okay.
2043922	2044463	Thanks for watching!
2063499	2090233	that you know remember I said I was playing a lot of Mass Effect multiplayer and it makes me want to play a first-person shooter because I really enjoy Mass Effect and the most people suggested I play Borderlands I think it was a great suggestion it is a little more first-person shootery than I'm used to and I was surprised I couldn't dumb the difficulty down because I like to play my shooters in easy noob noob mode but there is no difficulty you can do that yeah you gotta hacks it though you gotta hacks it I don't want to do that it's it's all right I didn't want to do that it's
2090513	2091494	I'm doing alright so far.
2091534	2093836	It's just multiplayer kicked our butt.
2094036	2095958	Like, because the enemies get so much stronger.
2096278	2098600	And now it's not just one guy running around not knowing what they're doing.
2098640	2099121	It's three.
2099441	2100682	This is me and two buddies of mine.
2100702	2101883	I want to play.
2102323	2104585	Yeah, well, we can certainly play later on.
2104626	2105406	I know Bobby's got it.
2105506	2106247	Alan's got it now.
2106747	2108469	Lots of people in the borderlands.
2109187	2112329	Otherwise, for me, I've been playing a lot of the same stuff.
2112450	2114831	Otherwise, not a lot of new, new stuff this week.
2114851	2117113	You know, World of Warcraft and all that good stuff.
2118794	2123618	I'm eagerly awaiting, thanks to Loki, I got a beta test code for the little big planet karting.
2124159	2125019	Super excited to try that out.
2125039	2127121	Play it as quickly as possible because it ends, like, Wednesday.
2127441	2127981	Oh no!
2128301	2129222	I'll download it tonight.
2129622	2131142	Play it Monday and Tuesday night or something.
2131442	2133083	Let you guys know my impressions on that next week.
2133683	2137565	That ought to be of interest to the PlayStation Home folks, because that's a Sony exclusive.
2137605	2139725	We've got some codes that we can give away too.
2139825	2141266	You say we have extra codes to give away?
2141286	2141766	Yeah, we do.
2143347	2148448	Maybe we need to do a giveaway tonight in the PlayStation Home clubhouse.
2148989	2149629	That'd be fun.
2150988	2152369	I think like three extra codes?
2153431	2155133	We'll think of a way to do a contest.
2155173	2157355	I don't want to ignore the folks in our live chat room either.
2157375	2159538	Maybe we'll give some codes away in some different places tonight.
2163242	2165765	Guess Marissa's cup size is the contest?
2166646	2167888	I can guess what it is.
2170057	2171479	I don't know about that, alright.
2173682	2180231	I gotta keep it, we might be a mature show, but I wanna keep it somewhat PG-13 at least at home.
2180532	2183957	Out of respect to the community, I wanna keep it a little PG-13 there.
2183977	2186260	Too big is the answer.
2186560	2186981	All right.
2189043	2191725	Shane is messaging me going, I want a freaking code.
2192226	2200334	Well, Shane, that's what you get for bragging about the PlayStation All-Stars Network Battle Royale thingy that you were in the beta for.
2200414	2201475	And I was like, let me play.
2201515	2202657	And you know what his answer was?
2202997	2203157	No.
2203597	2203678	No.
2207318	2208499	Geras Geras Geras
2226858	2233901	So next week, after Orange Lounge Radio, that's right, after Orange Lounge Radio, I think we've been doing this show like 10 years.
2233961	2235762	Have we ever had another show follow us?
2236182	2237702	Like usually we're the last show of the night, right?
2237722	2238883	Because like 1 a.m.
2238943	2240904	on the East Coast by the time we're done sometimes.
2241284	2247286	Well, next week, there is going to be a special show following us at vognetwork.com.
2247726	2248827	I know it's very late.
2249207	2251928	I know it's a long time to stay up, but this is very cool.
2252248	2254289	Travis Donovan from Under Sedation Live.
2254989	2260636	is going to be doing a special live VOG coverage of the Mars Curiosity landing.
2261077	2262078	So I think that's really cool.
2262198	2263801	Like, you know, it's a little bit of space.
2264141	2270689	Like, Travis, if you listen to Under Station Live at all, which is on Saturday nights at VOG, 7 o'clock Pacific, he loves space.
2270790	2271530	He loves NASA.
2271591	2272452	He loves the space program.
2272472	2273273	Is he the best at space?
2273593	2274053	He might be.
2274093	2276515	Which, by the way, before I forget, rest in peace, Sally Ride.
2276655	2277035	For real.
2277255	2277735	For real.
2278876	2279637	Sally Ride.
2280217	2284219	I mean, not just all the stuff that came out afterwards, but just Sally Ride.
2284399	2287581	You know, I was around like five or six when she first went into space.
2288382	2288522	And...
2290152	2292853	I don't even know how to put this.
2293373	2298655	At such a young age, you're even so happy to see a female go into space.
2299796	2304677	You kind of wonder as a kid, on one hand, you wonder, why is it such a big deal?
2305117	2309479	But on the other hand, you feel a lot of happiness and pride for that equality.
2309859	2311340	I remember feeling that at a young age.
2311860	2312800	And I'm not even a girl.
2312940	2314821	I guess I was a feminist at five years old.
2314881	2315221	Who knew?
2315341	2316902	But anyway, Sally Ride.
2317882	2320605	Amazing inspiration to men and women everywhere.
2320845	2328112	Am I really that out of current events that I didn't realize that we had sent another, like... Oh, another show.
2328132	2329333	That's just a one-time special.
2330254	2330794	No, no, no.
2330874	2331194	Not that.
2331235	2333917	I'm talking about sending something to Mars.
2334097	2337400	I didn't even realize that we had sent anything else to Mars.
2337921	2341244	I thought they were like, ah, we fucked up that last rover.
2341804	2342065	We're done.
2342925	2343266	I mean...
2344215	2344835	I mean, that's cool.
2345615	2346276	I think it's amazing.
2346316	2347196	Well, you know what?
2347356	2350537	You should tune in to Travis' special next week.
2350757	2351717	You might learn something.
2351737	2354138	It makes sense that now they have all these Mars landing games.
2354158	2356058	Like, who cares about landing on Mars now?
2356078	2357359	I mean, that's like so old.
2357539	2361080	And what the hell is the world turning to when I'm learning things from Travis Donovan?
2363094	2363375	Love you.
2364115	2364415	All right.
2366777	2367677	So I did want to plug that.
2367737	2371520	Of course, I want to plug our Facebook community, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2371680	2372901	And we are on Twitter as well.
2372921	2378264	You can follow us at OLR or you can follow the Voice of Geeks Network as a whole, VOG Network.
2378885	2383467	VOG Network did grow in the past couple weeks with a few new shows, Critical Myth and British Invaders.
2383528	2384528	Want to give them a shout out.
2384608	2388431	Great, great television and discussion shows.
2388851	2391873	They're both fantastic shows and so happy to have them on the lineup.
2392353	2411173	and of course one more shout out to the folks right now doing the running man or just hanging out whatever they're doing in Aurora 1.5 where PlayStation Summerfest is going on right now looks like it's thinned out a little bit there was a lot more people in there during Bobby's show but you know it's getting late on the East Coast some people got to go to bed sometimes
2411994	2413936	Alright, moving on.
2414356	2415537	Let's get into some gaming news.
2415557	2417098	I think we're just on the other side of the camera.
2417659	2418740	Oh, was the camera just facing that way?
2418780	2422983	Oh my god, someone made a Chibi Garrus plushie.
2424024	2426186	I see, from back here, I see a Junebug.
2426806	2428287	Says, thank you everyone very much.
2428588	2430349	Awesome job, VOG.
2430409	2431270	Thank you, Junebug.
2431670	2435854	She won a $20 gift card during Bobby Blackwolf's show tonight for PlayStation Network, and she called in.
2436474	2437434	And I thought that was amazing.
2438015	2438835	Shout out, Junebug.
2439515	2439776	All right.
2440436	2444678	Loki, starting us off tonight with exclusive news, maybe?
2444698	2445498	I guess.
2446258	2449860	See, I don't have all the details on this yet, but it was interesting.
2449900	2451081	It's a test that they're doing.
2451541	2464847	Apparently, that new Nike Plus Fitness game for Kinect that's coming out this fall is going to require a subscription service in order to play the game.
2465607	2470272	Now, I'm not sure exactly how that works in... Because I was asking him some questions.
2470613	2474297	He was basically... The rep we had at Microsoft was kind of using this.
2474337	2476979	Hey, we can sell some more points cards using this.
2476999	2477300	I'm like...
2477950	2484011	Are people going to be kind of pissed off that you guys are charging 400 Microsoft points a month for the service?
2484151	2486732	And I guess it's for stat tracking and something like that.
2488192	2495914	Now, he said, because I don't know too much about this game, he said that the game will not work unless you pay this monthly fee.
2496214	2499574	So I'm not sure what exactly is entailed there.
2499694	2502635	If it's just going to not track your progress...
2504015	2512140	That's what the monthly fee's for, or if it's just gonna plain, straight up not work unless you have, like, a pass or something to this.
2512440	2514461	If you don't pay us, you will get fat.
2515541	2518403	I mean, I don't know.
2518463	2521565	See, my thought is, you know, I was just kind of...
2522945	2525066	Why are you guys doing this?
2525146	2528107	I mean, aren't people going to look at this kind of negative?
2528127	2529907	Because I even brought up the typical things.
2530127	2531688	I love that you called them out on it.
2532088	2535409	You guys, you have your gold service that people are paying for.
2535469	2542871	Aren't you guys kind of worried that this might look bad since they're charging a fee on top of this?
2542991	2545112	And he said it's just a test right now.
2546172	2547253	So I don't know.
2548693	2549634	This is a test.
2549774	2550814	This is only a test.
2552555	2555176	That's me sucking money out of your wallet.
2555916	2567462	We'll have to see what exactly this is when it comes out because I'm sure that he didn't have all the details because trust me, I know reps for companies that don't know what the fuck they're talking about when it comes to product.
2569684	2573888	It's very possible that he got some stuff wrong or just wasn't clear on things.
2574869	2578833	Maybe it's just this whole stat tracking thing that's extra or something.
2578913	2587422	But I still don't like the fact that a game is requiring you for a monthly fee for something that should be, in my opinion, included with it.
2589238	2591641	So, we will see when this comes out.
2591741	2598129	And if it does require this, I mean, that kind of sucks for them because there's plenty of fitness games out there for the Xbox 360.
2598630	2601213	Yeah, I mean, this has to be something, like, super special.
2601273	2606820	But then the Nike Plus has that whole, like, will it integrate with the shoes?
2606860	2607041	Yes.
2607341	2607841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2630638	2633180	I wonder if that'll have to be like right there on the front of the box.
2633881	2635582	That they're going to be charging that.
2636403	2636803	It won't be.
2636903	2637804	That's scary.
2637944	2639465	Like, then what are you getting?
2640105	2643148	I mean, I can see if there's like a premium club or something.
2643188	2647011	I mean, I guess that's no different from what Call of Duty... I'm guessing that's what it's going to be maybe.
2647091	2652835	It's some sort of like, you know, if you subscribe to this, you'll get more out of it or something.
2652855	2655057	Because that would make sense to me.
2655217	2655457	I would...
2656639	2677302	it would be a huge mistake to say okay this game requires all this DLC but that's how he phrased it like I said you know maybe it's just him misinterpreting you know the information that he's been given it's possible but I just am reporting what I've been told so 400 Microsoft points a month
2678182	2681445	Some people have mixed success rates with those fitness games.
2681725	2699617	Brad is talking to me in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com right now, and he says, talking about fitness games, Christina got a Your Shape game, and while doing one of the initial setup scans, it told her, straighten your back, and they cracked up because she has scoliosis.
2700277	2702779	So her response was, good luck with that.
2703880	2704980	Oh dear, Marissa.
2710545	2713268	I can imagine Marissa playing the Your Shape game.
2713689	2715110	You seem a little top heavy.
2716332	2718274	I can't straighten my back either.
2719495	2720496	Put down your groceries.
2723139	2724181	Stop carrying that baby.
2724261	2725762	Please put down the watermelons.
2730427	2731828	I'll do Ooch's brassieres later.
2732949	2733369	Alright.
2735050	2736512	Anything else on this topic?
2736652	2738153	Loki, can I move on?
2739093	2742716	One more thing I forgot to mention this week on my gaming week.
2743036	2743797	I played Dead or Alive 5.
2743877	2745918	The near final build of that.
2746339	2746899	That's kind of cool.
2747119	2750302	But I don't play Dead or Alive so it was button mash fest.
2750682	2757907	I didn't do very well at that until I switched to Ryu and then I fucking kicked ass because he apparently is pretty conducive for button mashing.
2759188	2760029	It looks pretty, though.
2760590	2761310	Is Dead or Alive?
2762472	2764173	I made a huge faux pas, by the way.
2764434	2766135	Christina's a girlfriend, not a wife.
2766336	2766716	My bad.
2768618	2769819	Awkward!
2769919	2770660	Sorry, guys.
2775165	2775825	Back and away.
2779110	2781812	Did I mention what a great show PodCulture is?
2781972	2788957	And you should all listen to it so that I can be forgiven Monday nights at 6 o'clock.
2791499	2794561	He offered time at the dinner table.
2798104	2799145	Rob is rad now.
2800706	2801166	Don't worry.
2801226	2803508	It's just like when people say, so Alan's your roommate?
2806831	2808212	Well, yeah, we do live together.
2810040	2810740	In the same room.
2813801	2815762	And have mating practices.
2817142	2817522	All right.
2817842	2819423	Hey, let's move on to Windows 8.
2823123	2824844	Marissa, it's going to turn into the Giggle Show.
2824864	2825124	Stop.
2825844	2826204	All right.
2826524	2828565	She's over there making like she's digging a hole.
2830051	2835032	Let's talk about someone who's almost as awesome as Brad from PodCulture, Gabe Newell.
2836293	2838273	And he's talking about Windows 8.
2840034	2840834	He's not a fan.
2841234	2843095	You know, Windows 8 is coming out towards the end of the year.
2843175	2848436	I believe it's been officially dated for October 26th.
2848996	2851937	And it's going to be coming out, and a lot of people are excited about Windows 8.
2852157	2854678	But one of them that's not excited about Windows 8, Gabe Newell.
2855998	2857940	He says, quote, a catastrophe.
2858160	2861282	He just straight up called it a catastrophe and that's according to AllThingsD.
2861743	2865085	I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space.
2865505	2869949	I think we'll lose some of the top tier PC OEMs who will exit the market.
2870589	2871349	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2895297	2896919	Pretty big risk in a way.
2896959	2898060	I mean, I'm sure the Linux folks are happy.
2898080	2902244	That's crazy that all of a sudden old versions of Windows will just disappear and become Windows 8.
2902985	2910752	That is a little interesting, but... I mean, gee, what's going to happen to all those computers running those older OSs and people not upgrading?
2910892	2912814	Oh, I guess everything will work as usual.
2913435	2914476	That's odd.
2915116	2915317	Yeah.
2917159	2917359	Blizzard
2933220	2934061	Blizzard is on board with this.
2949513	2953978	It was according to Twitter and a comment from game designer Rob Pardo.
2954498	2957121	He said on Twitter, Nice interview with Gabe Newell.
2957401	2960424	I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space.
2960924	2962926	Not awesome for Blizzard either.
2963687	2967531	Now keep in mind, this is one guy at Blizzard, but when he is a game designer...
2970013	2972075	Yeah, so there you go.
2973096	2974478	Not some good early feedback.
2974938	2978802	I'm hoping this isn't going to go over like Windows ME or something or Windows Vista.
2979343	2979883	I know, right?
2981365	2984628	Even Marista, the non-gamer, is sitting over there going, oh, so cold, so cold.
2986130	2987291	Wait, give Marista the mic a minute.
2987311	2988753	Marista, you were not a fan of Windows ME?
2988773	2988813	No.
2989531	2991712	No, I've actually had it in many offices.
2993213	2997354	I've been a legal secretary at many points in my life, and attorneys are very cheap.
2997775	2999956	I've had to try to work with Windows MA.
2999976	3002577	I still have nightmares.
3005189	3008112	Alright, let me go back to the Gabe Newell thing a minute.
3008172	3012896	Alright, Jamie, listen up, because I know this is software that is a big part of what you do.
3013517	3018781	Because Gabe Newell kind of alluded to programs like Adobe Photoshop.
3019830	3022593	That causes us to have conversations with Adobe.
3022973	3028218	And we say the next version of Photoshop should look like a free to play game.
3028698	3034443	And they say, we have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, but it sounds really bad.
3034904	3036866	And what he means by that is that he's saying, you know,
3037406	3043452	People make money on things like Team Fortress 2 that are free to play.
3043973	3049038	One Steam user apparently making $150,000 a year selling hats in Team Fortress 2.
3049438	3055284	So he sort of goes to something like Adobe Photoshop and says, what if your platform was free
3055945	3056746	DarkSakura.com
3074113	3076034	Yeah, I mean, I could use GIMP.
3077776	3081979	I love GIMP too, but I want what Photoshop does, so I use Photoshop.
3082139	3085841	Aren't there a lot, I mean, let's have real talk for a minute.
3086162	3088343	Aren't there a lot of people that just pirate Photoshop?
3088683	3093207	I mean, isn't that what Newell's kind of trying to get at?
3093347	3094047	Yes.
3094508	3101673	Well, people are pirating it anyway, so why don't you just make it free for everybody and then add the features?
3102313	3103954	Because that's not going to work.
3104254	3110418	There's plenty of companies that are still going to buy the official ones for their designers at a design firm.
3110939	3120525	There are plenty of professionals who are going to have licensed copies because they can't produce work for a profit situation if they are using a pirated version.
3121874	3138342	they have to have licensing even free to play stuff sometimes has that pay tier you know like a lot of MMOs like you know Star Trek Online or DC Universe or whatever yeah it's free but then if you pay the monthly fee you get your you know uber access or whatever yeah Marissa let's give yeah
3139286	3144947	I would be happy to pay if it was a little more reasonable for those of us who aren't using it under a professional capacity.
3145747	3148368	Well, that's what surprised me about Windows 8 is the price.
3148588	3156489	A lot of people are shocked about Windows 8 price, but some people infer that that's coming from the Mac side of things where I think the latest Mac upgrade was, what, $20, $30?
3158069	3160750	Don't quote me on that because I don't have a Mac to upgrade right now.
3161630	3166211	But yeah, a lot of people are saying that Windows 8 is a cheap upgrade because of that.
3167415	3169617	It's an interesting counter move.
3169677	3169957	I like 7.
3171959	3172959	7 does what it needs to do.
3173560	3186730	And this is the whole reason why more and more people are leaving the PC and Mac universe to head over to Linux because they want to have the control over what they install in their systems.
3187371	3193796	I love Linux because if I want my system to be optimized for graphics over, say, sound...
3194396	3197718	All I have to do is install a new kernel that's optimized for graphics.
3198019	3198359	Done.
3199400	3201021	Or optimized for system speed.
3201481	3201761	Done.
3202482	3204743	I can switch between the two if I want to.
3206604	3208085	I have all of my programs.
3208185	3212868	I can download them through one place, yes, but they've been tested and work for my system.
3213309	3216571	I can still go through other means to download the programs that I want.
3217692	3224820	I'm running Linux Mint right now on my netbook, which was half the size of the Windows install that came on it.
3226122	3230887	And it uses, I think, a third of the memory resources that Windows does.
3231868	3233310	But is it efficient for porn?
3234378	3235879	Yes, I can watch porn on it, Rob.
3235939	3237360	Everything's efficient for porn.
3237700	3239001	Yay, Pornobox!
3239261	3240101	I love you, Linux!
3240982	3243904	I've just gotten done looking up a bunch of Mass Effect porn.
3243964	3247686	I mean... You mean DeviantArt.
3247746	3248106	Whatever.
3250806	3254348	It's, I'm, I'm, I'm doing work.
3254628	3255729	Alright, DarkSakura.
3256489	3261132	Any computer, if a computer from back in the 90s is efficient enough for porn, which mine was.
3261292	3263053	They're slow, let's be real.
3263073	3265174	Then a netbook can easily look up porn.
3265234	3269777	I mean, Loki, I know you were the kid like me who dialed into all the BBSs.
3269917	3270638	To download porn?
3270658	3271278	To download porn!
3271298	3271978	It took time!
3272318	3274160	That was dedication, because if that picture...
3275020	3276801	And we were thankful Animated GIFs That's right
3300626	3301206	and you what?
3301407	3301847	You know what?
3301987	3307770	You were lucky if it was in 256 colors because You look at those boobies in 16 colors and you'll like it.
3318379	3330410	Go find an old Abandonware archive somewhere and download an old school strip poker game from like 1984 for what was called, now kids, I know you might not have heard of this, but for what's called a CGA monitor.
3330970	3334313	Does anybody know what a CGA monitor does?
3334393	3335775	And then we had EGA.
3335875	3336335	Okay.
3337356	3338917	I have a dirty porn story.
3339858	3340959	My favorite!
3341959	3344201	Safe for your audience though, but it's funny that you mention that.
3345202	3352607	With the internet and internet pornography, it's amazing actually how much of a backlog and things that were on VHS that are on the internet.
3353287	3360332	I found out that a friend of mine, a gentleman, had done porn.
3361193	3362874	I was there for this.
3363014	3363975	Well, you live in L.A.,
3365379	3367621	She found out while she was here.
3368441	3370042	The Wii came out.
3371583	3376567	Now I understand why when we were doing the whole cute little find out your porn star name game.
3376827	3379148	Now I understand why he thought that game was so funny.
3380489	3381730	Now I understand.
3383391	3387154	I managed to look it up and I found it.
3387194	3388274	It was like 94.
3388314	3390376	I also found out that he hadn't changed his comforter.
3390516	3395159	I had house sat for him once and I was grossed out because they shot it at his house.
3395399	3397240	Did you run and take a shower immediately?
3397260	3397960	Yes!
3398281	3400462	He had a chair.
3400502	3402003	It was the same comfort.
3402063	3403063	I slept in the bed.
3403123	3407486	I was watching his house and I took a screenshot of his own face and I sent it to all his friends.
3408626	3409106	Wow!
3410527	3412708	That is a cunty thing to do!
3412969	3413909	Oh my god.
3413929	3415550	I'm sorry if that word offends you.
3415610	3415930	Alright.
3415950	3418131	I didn't want to go there.
3418231	3421293	That is like drag queen level see you next Tuesday.
3421593	3422694	That would be the truth.
3423254	3426898	But the problem was, Rob... You sent a picture of his O-face to all of his friends.
3426918	3427598	Here's the problem.
3428159	3429040	I had dated him.
3430781	3432043	And he did not tell me.
3433684	3440811	Okay, I didn't want to have to make that confession, but yes, I have fucked a porn star.
3442313	3444194	Congratulations.
3444214	3444495	Yay!
3444997	3447399	The things we learned on Orange Lounge Radio.
3447479	3448540	The more you know.
3448801	3452124	In retrospect, his technique makes a lot more sense now.
3455247	3463474	Now I look back and... By technique meaning that he used the same techniques that butchers use for tenderizing meats?
3465236	3469760	Or perhaps that you're like, man, were you like a butter churner in your past life or something?
3469840	3470041	I mean...
3472281	3478224	I just want to give another hello to the PlayStation homers joining us for the first time at the Voice of Geeks Network.
3478264	3479744	These are the things geeks have to say.
3479804	3480144	Who knew?
3480825	3481705	Well, you know what?
3481725	3488268	There's a comment coming from PlayStation Home from MandaPanda1979 Snow White banging the seven dwarves hot.
3489388	3493070	It really wasn't that hot, but yet we were 13 and loved it.
3493690	3499092	One of the days of the pornos he was in was called Country Western Cuties Nude Pie Eating Contest.
3504240	3506322	Bob is on the floor, literally.
3507582	3509864	He was actually a country singer-songwriter.
3509884	3510904	That's how I knew him.
3512425	3515987	Okay, for the record, I had just broken up with my boyfriend.
3516348	3517949	It was a very dark time for me.
3520202	3521564	So how about video games?
3521824	3523446	That email actually sent them all.
3523467	3526231	My friends had said, I have a present for you.
3526932	3531739	And it had the screen cap of his own face and in porny font it said, you're welcome.
3532099	3533281	It's a pie-eating gun.
3535924	3536725	I'm so sorry!
3537485	3545430	Oh yeah, and by the way, I actually had asked a bunch of my friends to tune in this evening who are not aware of this story.
3546011	3549073	So now they know a lot more about me than I'd ever cared to have them know.
3549733	3557438	I'm surprised that that's the title of it because that's actually, that's pretty, you know, it's not bad for a porn title.
3557478	3557938	I mean, there's...
3560535	3564596	No, we're talking like actual pies and not like pies in the pornographic sense.
3565336	3566396	That's what my mind went.
3568096	3571857	I've been literally rolling on the floor laughing so hard.
3572417	3573117	You're welcome.
3574418	3576938	I'd like to take this moment to apologize.
3577118	3579119	Can we get to the games, please?
3580619	3581059	Maybe.
3583539	3586440	Chiggers says that I'm going all Anderson Cooper right now.
3587521	3589422	Rob was literally on the floor.
3589602	3594526	You know what's funny is I had some people come up to you during the game summit thing that we had at our work and everything.
3594807	3599050	And they're like, hey, so I have some libraries and stuff that might be interesting in your podcast.
3599070	3601232	I'm like, you do realize this is a pretty adult podcast.
3601472	3603113	Like, we use some colorful languages and stuff.
3603373	3604394	They're like, yeah, that's okay.
3604614	3608137	I'm like, are you sure you know what you're getting into?
3608217	3610499	Well, if Catcher in the Rye is at the library, I mean.
3611060	3611860	Whatever, you know.
3611880	3612361	All right.
3612381	3613181	They're not my customers.
3613201	3613522	I don't care.
3614992	3624060	Okay, Monty Boggs in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm so glad this is the OLR live I get to come back to after so much time away.
3624080	3625341	Please don't put this on the wiki.
3627943	3630705	Somehow Windows 8 led to that discussion.
3633308	3640414	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Olive.
3641656	3646882	So DarkSakura, why don't you try to bring us back to games here with another story?
3647103	3647503	Fuck.
3647883	3648644	More porn, please.
3648684	3649585	No, no, not that.
3651966	3661889	Square is saying that Versus 13 is going to still be out and they still are not showing shit about it.
3662849	3664190	But they are watching porn!
3664350	3664530	No.
3666430	3674433	There was basically a statement by Yoichi Wada saying that someone was spreading a rumor about Versus being cancelled.
3675534	3688884	They said that he just left a regularly scheduled meeting for Versus and quote says, if you were to see the city, et cetera, presented today, you wouldn't be able to stand from surprise.
3690145	3692147	Because everybody thinks the game is dead.
3692527	3692747	Yeah.
3693187	3702655	Could it be though, I mean, okay, so it's not canceled, but weren't there a lot of, you know, kind of rumor, I mean, granted, this is all rumors or whatever, that it could be a different name now?
3703819	3704440	I don't know.
3704540	3707562	They just said that they're still running it under the luminous engine.
3708362	3708622	Well, I know.
3708642	3709443	That's a lot of what we talked about.
3709463	3714126	Because when this story came up last week, you weren't here, but we hypothesized that it could be 15.
3714166	3715387	It doesn't say anything about it.
3715527	3718209	It's going to be Final Fantasy XIII, a sequel reborn.
3720609	3721470	I see what you did there.
3721750	3722570	We'll come back to that.
3724830	3727251	DarkSakura, what do you think of Final Fantasy XIII Versus?
3727551	3733272	Given that I didn't play the first XIII more than the level, then I kind of am not interested in it.
3733412	3736793	Well, keep in mind, Versus is more Kingdom Hearts-ish in the way it plays.
3737033	3737833	I play Kingdom Hearts.
3738993	3742594	I mean, seriously, I'm kind of spent on the Final Fantasy franchise.
3743194	3744734	I kind of don't care about it anymore.
3745515	3747695	XIV didn't help, but we'll get back to that later.
3748334	3748836	I didn't play 12.
3750340	3755095	I tried to play 13 and I thought it wasn't great and I'm really not invested in the universe.
3755717	3755877	So...
3757077	3781738	I think honestly between 13 and 13 verses it's pretty much just like Joel Schumacher Batman and you know a different Batman Final Fantasy 14 was kind of the Batman and Robin of the series right now it's kind of like we had to hire who's like a big we had to hire Steven Spielberg to redo Batman and Robin like that's what's going on in Final Fantasy 14 right now
3782779	3788182	All right, let's move on with some more news while I get a drink of water because my face still hurts from laughing so hard.
3788282	3789103	Damn you, Marissa.
3789543	3792485	This is why you haven't been on this show because you kill me every time.
3793786	3796847	I'm trying to take... I'm on the Facebook app right now.
3797128	3801070	I'm trying to take down the link I'd sent to all my friends inviting them to listen in.
3805032	3805873	I'm turning to the pod.
3806233	3807354	Not all of them knew that.
3808254	3808894	It's okay, though.
3808934	3809575	It is funny.
3810490	3812392	I love you so much right now, I can't even.
3813793	3815715	Alright, so what was his porn star name?
3816716	3816956	No.
3818137	3822220	Everybody's gonna Google it now.
3822741	3823201	Let's move on.
3823421	3826784	Games, video games, gaming culture, that's what we do here at OLR.
3826845	3829127	I'll tell you later.
3829547	3831068	So let's talk about Ouya.
3831789	3836133	Ouya is that wonderful $99 console that's being kickstarted.
3836753	3844478	They made some announcements including that the streaming service OnLive will be coming to the system as well.
3844958	3863889	Not a big surprise since OnLive runs on Android and it's an Android device so it makes sense to me that it would be on there but of course OnLive has committed that they will deliver a full console class experience and bring hundreds of top tier games from more than 80 publishers more marketing speak marketing speak marketing speak
3864749	3886240	and then of course at the same time they also showed the second half of that concept picture for the Ouya controller and yeah it looks like the second half of the controller what do you expect and of course everyone's like oh I don't like that d-pad well everything's still not finalized it's just a concept picture but now you have your second half and wow it's looks like what you thought it would look like
3890021	3910046	The Ouya, the on-live thing is a really interesting backdoor to get the big games on Ouya because you remember a couple weeks ago we were kind of having our skepticism chat about should we fund this or not and we were talking about how they're doing this poll to see what games people want on Ouya and it's all this first-party stuff is what people really want.
3910127	3914788	It's like, dude, this box is not going to be powerful enough to run Mass Effect 3 or something like that.
3915288	3922810	But, thanks to on-live technology, you could play Assassin's Creed or whatever the games are that are on OUYA.
3923610	3925210	Borderlands is one of them, I know that.
3925950	3932792	And I don't believe a publisher can say, no, we don't want our game pushed to such and such.
3933372	3934252	I don't think, yeah.
3934352	3939853	Yeah, so that is, I gotta say, that's a really smart partnership.
3940393	3950872	because you're using a technology that your system can accommodate to kind of use those big games.
3950912	3953577	And I think that's a really brilliant idea on their part.
3953874	3954795	Yeah.
3955295	3961662	And then, of course, I think we may have mentioned this last week that they're getting the prequel to The Human Element.
3961782	3963263	It's going to be an exclusive thing on there.
3963503	3963724	Yeah.
3963884	3965705	Considering that that game doesn't come out until 2015.
3966026	3970350	I don't even know... Why would you even announce a game that's going to come out that far from now?
3970550	3970850	I mean...
3974212	3976413	Cool, you got a game coming out in 2015.
3976594	3977935	I won't remember by the time we get to 2015.
3979355	3988221	TigerClaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, who earlier told me they were feeling ignored because of all the attention I'm giving to PlayStation Home tonight.
3988702	3992544	I love you guys too, at the regular chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
3992985	3998248	TigerClaw says, on live is on Android, so it coming to OUYA was a no-brainer.
3998628	4003351	Well, if you had said that last week, TigerClaw, you would have really looked like a games analyst, but now...
4005553	4012420	I mean, I'm not surprised, because even if it wasn't on there, they could have easily just sideloaded it on there.
4012840	4019347	And GameGuru reminds us, OnLive already has a set-top box, you know, so it's already available out there.
4019918	4022580	True, I think their set-top box is like $50 too.
4023241	4028345	But at least this you'll get a set-top box that'll do that and other things.
4029587	4032089	It'd be cool if it was compatible with the on-live controllers.
4032929	4039575	I'm hoping that it's going to be compatible with any Bluetooth controller because then I can use my PS3 controller, which isn't getting a whole ton of use right now.
4041417	4045420	Except for browsing porn on the PS3.
4047304	4048065	Fizz Liz Giggle Time
4075544	4079086	So apparently now it's the Running Man and Giggle Fitz in PlayStation Home.
4079306	4079967	Summerfest.
4081087	4083869	Awesome.
4084909	4086670	I don't think the Carlton's one of the dances.
4086770	4087291	It might be.
4089232	4090152	You know what's great?
4090613	4091373	Tangent time.
4091393	4092874	You ready for a random Rob tangent?
4093925	4096707	They upgraded the Lotus Notes system at my work.
4096767	4101330	Yes, my work is one of the few that uses Lotus Notes as opposed to Outlooks, the other one, right?
4101790	4102611	So we use Lotus Notes.
4102891	4108074	And one of the huge new features is customizable emote icons.
4108695	4112137	So now when you do the instant message, you can have your own emote icons.
4112537	4121804	And one of the most popular ones right now that has been passed around at the workplace that we send to each other is the Carlton GIF when something goes well.
4124206	4127473	You can add any animated gif to the emoticon system, which is amazing.
4127493	4130680	Please tell me that you've added the table flipping or something.
4130820	4133285	I don't have a table flipping, but I have a cat jumping out a window.
4135172	4137273	It looks... It's a safe cat.
4137313	4137554	Don't worry.
4137614	4139435	It looks like a great distance, but it's not.
4139455	4141156	It's just like jumping into the backyard or something.
4141636	4142496	But it's funny.
4143137	4143377	All right.
4143697	4144117	Moving on.
4145658	4153883	Some things coming to... I feel bad that on the Sony PlayStation Home Night we have all this Microsoft news, but we do have some Sony news coming up a little later.
4154303	4158105	But this is an interesting experience on the Xbox 360.
4158145	4159786	There's some new TV...
4160947	4163409	TV Experiences coming later this year.
4163830	4176201	They are Connect Sesame Street TV, not to be confused with the game that already came out, and Connect National Geographic TV, which I think they're just calling Nat Geo, because I guess that's what the hip kids call it.
4176702	4177542	Nat Geo.
4178483	4178763	All right.
4179504	4182667	They will be $29.99, that's 2,400 Microsoft points, for eight 30-minute episodes.
4182807	4182947	Wow.
4188172	4191153	Apparently they are interactive TV shows, though.
4191553	4196894	They will be available at retail and Xbox Live under the season pass.
4197494	4202855	So I don't know how the interactive episode works, but I imagine maybe you'll like Sesame Street.
4203275	4205176	You interact with Kinect stuff.
4205356	4207036	That's interesting.
4207096	4212557	Elmo will tell you, hey, toss me my teddy bear, and you make the motion like you're tossing him a teddy bear.
4212877	4215438	And if you don't, it will still play on as well.
4215718	4217178	It's optional.
4218092	4221096	I gotta say, if I had kids, that does sound pretty rad.
4221316	4222217	It does sound pretty rad.
4222237	4223679	Have you thought about something like this for Josh?
4223979	4225761	I've definitely thought about it.
4225881	4226782	I may pick it up.
4227763	4229626	How does Nat Geo work?
4230764	4234087	I want to see the topless natives point.
4235008	4237009	I think it's animals, not topless natives.
4238391	4243355	It's more like, hey, can you spot the giraffe or something like that?
4243515	4245737	You'll be given a thing that you have to find.
4245877	4246757	I found it right there!
4248599	4249740	Trivia and stuff like that.
4250460	4253483	The other thing, too, is those are also rentable.
4253723	4254604	I was gonna get to that.
4254664	4258466	You can also buy the episodes individually for five bucks.
4258786	4260347	That's 400 Microsoft points.
4260607	4262569	September 18th is when this all starts.
4262589	4263909	Well, that's the purchase then.
4264009	4266591	Renting them is 240 Microsoft points each.
4266871	4267412	Interesting.
4268911	4270252	That might be worth checking out.
4270272	4274236	You should definitely put Josh to the test there and see if it happens.
4274496	4277519	It's hard to say if he'll... He probably won't know what to do.
4277819	4279020	He's still a little young.
4279481	4285587	If they tell him, hey, jump up and down, sing a song, he's just going to sit there and eat a cracker.
4285887	4289891	He's like, no, I'm not going to do that.
4290951	4296292	Skull King in PlayStation Home says, will this Sesame Street game be like Dora the Explorer?
4296712	4297873	If so, I'm down.
4298373	4303074	That's kind of how, yeah, that show works a little bit.
4304094	4305074	But it's like for real.
4305454	4308355	Maybe that'll be the next thing that comes to Kinect if these do well.
4308395	4309995	It's all about how well these do.
4310515	4316437	But Sesame Street, as iconic as it is, I imagine it's got to be pretty cheap to produce.
4316517	4317397	Yeah.
4318317	4323882	Since this is all PBS programming Fuck Dora the Explorer, she's on Nickelodeon You know what it's all about?
4324522	4329646	Fucking Carmen Sandiego, that's right Ghostwriter on there?
4330727	4342235	No, no, no Reading Rainbow I want LeVar Burton to read to me on my Xbox 360 in that sexy, sexy voice
4347139	4347820	Ah, PBS.
4348481	4349662	Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.
4349722	4354007	Like, I know Mr. Rogers is long gone, but maybe a live interaction with King Friday.
4354908	4356469	And what was that lady's name?
4356950	4357811	She was kind of a bitch.
4358011	4361775	The lady that had the museum or something, the carousel.
4363597	4364218	Yeah, you lost me.
4364238	4365199	Somebody with me here.
4365299	4365699	Come on.
4365719	4366220	I have a shirt.
4368562	4370863	We were listening to the theme song yesterday.
4371703	4379907	Two elephants went out to play upon a spider's web one day.
4380147	4385189	Where the hell is my goddamn Bob Ross painting game that I was promised at the launch of the Wii?
4386189	4386409	Huh?
4386649	4388790	Please tell me you heard that new Bob Ross remix.
4388890	4389571	Yeah, it's alright.
4390051	4390551	It's nice.
4394049	4396711	Lady Elaine, thank you, DJ Morpheus.
4397051	4398753	I knew somebody in chat would know it.
4399513	4400173	Lady Jane?
4400694	4401915	Frisbee gives the full name.
4402315	4404156	Lady Elaine Fairchild.
4404276	4404977	That was it.
4405397	4406418	Lady Fairchild.
4407839	4408899	She was kind of a bitch.
4412402	4413282	What do you want?
4415625	4435522	make believe I don't give a fuck make believe I'm gonna kick your ass I make believe you weren't talking to me hold on sorry dead air but I'm trying to look up right now on the YouTubes if I can get a clip here oh fuck yes here we go
4438960	4440440	Oh, damn it, that's like a song or something.
4440941	4442341	That's a creepy puppet is what that is.
4442361	4445522	It had a picture on it, but... Is she a creepy puppet?
4446182	4447242	She was a creepy puppet!
4448682	4449423	Alright, forget it.
4450483	4453944	Although, maybe if that pop song's any good, I could put that in a VOG Network rotation.
4454384	4456204	Anyhow, let's move on with some more stories.
4456284	4456984	DarkSakura.
4459465	4463186	Well, how about a survival game called Pulse?
4463906	4464806	It's free!
4465546	4467187	And it was put out by the Vancouver Film School.
4469116	4470057	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4497435	4506297	and the sounds they make help her see the world around her kind of you know daredevil like so she has sonar she has sonar by throwing fairies into the wall
4508398	4533358	and it's done by Pixel Pie team and it's very artsy, colorful, cartoony but it's very, very grim and actually they want to expand it beyond the free version but for now I think if you want to get it you can go to their official site which is teampixelpie as in 3.14 dot com
4537426	4539026	I'm going to get it when I get home.
4539066	4541607	I'm glad these students had time to produce this, you know.
4542407	4544048	And the site is really pretty.
4544128	4545508	I love the color scheme in this.
4546248	4548509	It really is just very different.
4550029	4551470	Well, congrats to the folks at Bear Cooper Films.
4551490	4552410	Well, there's another one, too.
4552450	4552750	Oh, really?
4553410	4560212	There's one called The Mask of Ki, QI, which is a third-person platformer that has a masked flying squirrel.
4561292	4563073	And it's done by Team Kronk.
4563573	4564613	And it's another freebie.
4566394	4573401	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out release dates of some more traditional retail games coming to a store near you this week.
4573582	4573742	Loki?
4574079	4584982	Not a lot of big things, but the couple big games that you'll probably be interested in, starting off with Risen 2 Dark Waters on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and I believe PC.
4586062	4595804	And then for 3DS owners, finally getting your copy of Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance in 3D on 3DS.
4595844	4596464	You don't say.
4597204	4598225	Yes, I do say.
4599185	4599325	And...
4600946	4602467	I think that's pretty much it.
4602527	4603968	I mean, at least those are the big ones this week.
4603988	4606451	Well, the Kingdom Hearts game is kind of a big deal, so that's cool.
4608953	4610714	Yeah, that'd be it.
4610855	4611695	Oh, Growlancers.
4611815	4612156	I'm sorry.
4612496	4613977	Growlancer way far over time.
4614398	4615899	Forgot the Atlas PSP title.
4617240	4619842	All right, moving to Japan and checking out the release dates over there.
4619962	4624065	The Idolmaster 2 gets a price reduction this week on the Xbox 360.
4624105	4628888	That's not a new release, but if you like to save money, that will be going into effect this week.
4629268	4637034	On the PlayStation 3, things are a little more exciting when you have Tales of Vesperia also getting a price reduction and Tales of Graces F.
4637734	4644219	also getting a price reduction and Troy Musu getting a price reduction as well as Idolmaster 2.
4644419	4645460	There's lots of price reductions.
4645580	4646961	Oh, Battlefield Bad Company 2.
4648042	4653446	It's like a PlayStation 3 sale but sadly no new games to report on either of those systems this week in Japan.
4654147	4663218	Looking at the PlayStation Vita, there is a game called Momo Daisensu Gendaiban comes out this week in a regular and premium edition.
4663258	4664660	That's a game on the Vita.
4665461	4670948	I don't know if that's based off an anime or what, but it's from System Soft, and it kind of looks like these...
4671969	4675512	I have to randomly add that Chris always compliments your Japanese pronunciation.
4675532	4676653	He's always impressed by it.
4676673	4678835	Don't listen to early episodes of the show because it was a hot mess.
4678855	4679356	Never had a class.
4696511	4700134	Well, I did have Jamie sitting over here to slap me on the back of the head when I'd get one wrong.
4700334	4700934	I can't do it right.
4700954	4701655	Punch, punch, punch.
4701675	4703376	Put the emphasis on the wrong syllable.
4706839	4713764	On the 3DS this week, more exciting games like Smile Precure, Let's Go, Marchin' World.
4715285	4722611	Madagascar 3 and Wan Nyan Dobutsu Buyen 2 Sorry, that's not a Nyan cat game.
4722651	4723893	It just happens to have that in the name.
4723913	4726034	But there is a cat and a dog in it.
4726054	4733761	I thought for a second there was like Wan Nyan Midnight Maximum Toon or something like that.
4734042	4738706	A crazy drift racing Nyan cat starring Toons as the driving cat.
4738806	4739827	It would be awesome.
4741301	4768853	this actually looks super cute like it looks like a pet hospital kind of game because the front cover has all these you know this guy and ladies in like lab long white coats that you'd see veterinarians wear and it's all kitties and puppies and that guy in the back look oh my god this is perfect Shane if you're listening you need to see this dude in the back with blue hair holding a corgi that's like it's Shane it's Shane personified right there I'm gonna send him a link to this in case he's listening all right
4770416	4770956	Moving on.
4771036	4772196	I'm sorry, I'm busy calibrating.
4773277	4774097	Who are you, Garrus?
4776097	4777277	Let's do UK releases.
4777858	4784059	Okay, well, in the UK, I'm going to have to reload the page, but on the 30th, we have Orcs Must Die.
4785419	4788140	And now I have to go back to the top of the page and load it next month.
4789220	4794281	So, they freaking changed how their things work, so whatever.
4796102	4797903	Um, where's fucking August?
4798284	4798624	Fuck.
4799324	4800045	Okay, August.
4801046	4801786	I can't help it!
4803147	4803807	Stop judging me.
4804288	4804508	Okay.
4804908	4807330	On August 1st, Deadlight and Puddle.
4808211	4810492	On August 3rd, Risen 2, Dark Waters.
4810752	4811393	And then that's all.
4811433	4812634	And if there's anything else, I don't care.
4815876	4818398	Sorry, folks overseas, but DarkSakura doesn't care.
4818965	4821206	No, that's all that Eurogamer told me there was.
4821867	4822147	All right.
4822447	4823388	A couple more news stories.
4823468	4824568	I couldn't be bothered.
4825349	4826830	A couple more news stories for you guys.
4826870	4828911	And then the classic game of the week.
4828991	4835515	We're going to take a trip down memory lane and revisit a game from the past that you should check out because DarkSakura told you to.
4835835	4837216	But first, a couple more news stories.
4837256	4839217	In this case, because Dan told me to tell you to.
4839918	4840218	Loki.
4840768	4852474	Alright, so apparently GameStop CEO Paul Raines, he made a comment regarding the possibility of a used digital downloads format.
4853014	4869302	Basically, the whole lawsuit that happened in the UK kind of set an interest, well, it didn't really set a precedent, but it was interesting that they kind of favored towards that, that you should be able to get refunds for used games when you're done using them.
4870062	4871484	and many more.
4892502	4902607	and they kind of have a similar service on there where you can use GU to create PC licenses for different games.
4904508	4908389	And they say, no, we don't see a lot of interest in the model from our publishing partners.
4910948	4914891	but definitely something that they're interested in looking at when that time comes.
4915211	4922737	And I guess it makes sense if everything's going to go digital and stuff and they do eventually have a way to revoke licenses, which would be pretty cool.
4923057	4926460	I mean, especially some of the stuff I have on Steam and stuff.
4926520	4936748	If I could sell some of the things that I'm not playing and I got in some of these indie bundles, that would be kind of cool to trade it in for other things.
4938169	4942612	But, of course, if it has anything to do with used game sales, they're probably all over it.
4943512	4944293	You think this could work?
4945053	4949816	It could work, but it involves all the publishers having to agree on that kind of thing.
4949857	4953339	And that's kind of basically agreeing to having a used marketplace.
4953539	4956001	And isn't that what they're kind of trying to get rid of already?
4956261	4956561	Yeah.
4956601	4960283	So, that's... I don't think that this is ever going to...
4961744	4977713	You know, hit full force anytime soon There's a part of me that thinks a system like this is just begging to be hacked Like, I kind of think they might try to implement Well, then again, I don't know Steam works alright Like, they haven't been able to hack Steam, right?
4978433	4989979	But, I don't know Something like this just seems like it's begging to be worked around There's ways to hack games Not that I'm saying you should do it But it definitely is one of the things that's got to be giving publishers pause
4992208	4994869	I just think a lot of these systems are going to be closed.
4995649	5001971	And then the other thing too is like say I have a PS3 game or something like that and I want to trade my digital copy in for something.
5002372	5003912	What if I want to get a 360 game with that?
5004272	5005093	Am I going to be able to do that?
5005273	5007353	The system is going to be separate and you have different rules.
5007473	5010675	I mean there's a whole lot of things going on there.
5010795	5015676	And it's just – that's probably why this isn't – they're trying to get rid of used game sales.
5015696	5017397	They're not going to try to all of a sudden say –
5017757	5020898	Hey, yeah, we're gonna go digital, but we're bringing used games back.
5020978	5022099	That's not gonna happen.
5022559	5026000	I mean, come on, they're doing this to get people to buy new games in the first place.
5026420	5031482	They're not going to all of a sudden flip a 180 and just say, hey, by the way, used games are awesome.
5032603	5033423	No, that's not gonna happen.
5034303	5039986	All right, one more story for you guys here before the classic game of the week, and it has to do with Final Fantasy XIV.
5040546	5046508	Yes, we do want to do a little reporting on Final Fantasy XIV because, you know, very interesting MMO.
5046728	5050050	I mean, it wasn't that great when it came out.
5050090	5050610	Let's be real.
5050650	5054772	If you played it on PC, especially when it first came out, it was a really crap game.
5055532	5063076	There have been improvements since it first launched, and they're promising even more before the big launch on PlayStation 3 later this year.
5063537	5069340	Well, they now are officially calling it Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn.
5069720	5073482	That is the version 2.0 of the game that's going to be coming out later this year.
5073802	5075123	I don't think it's coming out later this year.
5075964	5076344	Oh, really?
5078203	5080785	I have a TBA 2013 date right now for it.
5080925	5081726	Really?
5083087	5084708	Well, they did put out a trailer this week.
5084888	5088712	I haven't even watched this trailer yet, but I'm told there's no gameplay in it.
5088772	5089853	It's just CGI.
5089893	5090273	Really?
5090593	5092255	Final Fantasy trailer, no gameplay in it?
5092275	5093035	I know, right?
5093075	5093856	Color me shocked.
5094036	5101341	Apparently, a lot of this has to do with, like, it's basically Final Fantasy XIV Cataclysm.
5102782	5106784	I mean, look, you can see, and we're watching the trailer here, and you can probably hear a little bit of the audio coming through the feed.
5107205	5112528	But we're looking at, you know, missiles flying from the sky and basically destroying things.
5112588	5115350	You see all these, like, warriors suiting up and putting up shields.
5115710	5118192	But it's very obvious the world is being hit.
5118612	5122675	So that tells me that's their, you know, just like they did in World of Warcraft, that's their way to...
5123055	5149835	To change the look of the world and so forth But I gotta say, you know, CGI heavy or not, it looks great Of course the original trailer for XIV looked awesome I remember that original trailer at E3 gave me chills Just because I spent so many years with Final Fantasy XI I was like legit that excited And then when I played the game I had different type of chills So cold, so cold, it's so bad Why is this allowed to be released?
5149855	5151216	He touched me in a dirty place
5151576	5153218	But see, that looks pretty rad, doesn't it?
5153638	5155360	I don't know.
5155380	5156581	I'm just looking here at the end.
5156741	5158063	I'm trying to see if there's actually a date.
5158543	5159564	Nope, coming soon.
5159764	5160445	They don't have a date.
5160825	5162647	Coming soon to PlayStation 3 and PC.
5162787	5170235	December 31st, 2013 is what the placeholder date is right now, which means TBA 2013.
5170295	5172237	If it's TBA 2012, then yeah, maybe later this year, but...
5173078	5178784	Akuma JP says, Meteo, maybe that's a reference to what you might be seeing there in the trailer.
5178864	5179525	Very interesting thought.
5179905	5186873	Monty Boggs says, Final Fantasy, the new 52, in parentheses, online players via PlayStation 3.
5189196	5190197	I see what you did there.
5190897	5195920	Yeah, AkumaJP is putting it together saying there's a red meteor in the sky, so he thinks it's gonna involve Meteor.
5196220	5202064	I gotta say, Final Fantasy XIV, at least the look of it fits in very well with the series.
5202144	5205246	It's just kind of, you know, a bummer the game was kind of crap.
5205826	5210689	Final Fantasy XI, a game reborn into Final Fantasy Version 2.
5212010	5216233	Alright, look, let's take a step back to a time when games are a lot more simple.
5218393	5219554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5247694	5248274	DarkSakura.com
5269688	5275732	You can basically have as many vehicles as you want to complete the rally, but you have to have gas.
5277313	5287499	In the arcade, the Sega, and the Lynx version, you could start the game at a higher rally and get more opportunities to jump levels.
5288860	5294644	And you can continue the game from where you left off, but you only have one chance to complete the 50th and final rally.
5295604	5301270	So you have fuel, four ways that you can get in this game by green globes, red globes, a checkpoint, and the rally point.
5302150	5304713	Green globes are on the road and they fill your main tank.
5304793	5308576	Red globes are getting by shooting enemies on the road.
5309577	5315043	And after you complete the rally, you get an extra fuel reserve depending on how many enemies you destroy.
5315743	5320007	So you get fuel by blowing shit up.
5320087	5326112	Each consecutive kill shot increases your multiplier one up to ten, and a miss lowers your multiplier by one.
5326812	5332877	So, whatever your multiplier is that when you cross the line, you get that much fuel.
5333878	5337641	So... Excuse me, I just finished my coffee.
5338042	5338882	Wow, girl.
5339263	5339723	Shut up.
5340283	5340844	It's your coffee.
5343146	5353610	Like I said, you have a checkpoint, a midway point, where when you cross that line, you actually get the amount of fuel in the main tank restored to what it was at the beginning of the rally.
5355051	5360353	But your reserve tank is not restored, so it's just basically like you get a quick fill-up.
5360453	5360953	Quick fill-up.
5362033	5363234	So you've got different cars in there.
5363254	5364876	You have the Stingers, which are orange.
5365376	5366557	Command cars, which are purple.
5366597	5370980	They have bulletproof bumpers and must be killed by a cruise missile or an electro shield.
5371560	5373062	You have Cycles, Rat Jeeps.
5373102	5373982	They come in from the left.
5374042	5375103	Stop and swerve to the right.
5375463	5376904	So basically, they're like knights in chess.
5377945	5384732	Gun turrets, you have mines on the road, you cannot destroy them, but you get alarms that let you know where they are.
5385273	5386234	And toxic spells.
5386814	5389437	You get special weapons, you get the UZ Cannon.
5390057	5395002	It's a rapid fire gun that does not deplete your multiplier, but they have limited ammo.
5395363	5398225	You have a cruise missile, which kaboom, you get three missiles.
5399166	5404971	Nitro Inject, which increases your speed from 210 to 298 kilometers per hour.
5405311	5406131	What is this British game?
5407172	5412276	Electro Shield, which lets you drive through the enemy unharmed for a short distance and you get three to a pack.
5414297	5420560	Um, they wanted, though, now this is a little bit of information about the production, which actually this little bit, I did not know.
5421340	5428823	The creators wanted to have an electronic version of Mr. Sandman to play on one of the levels, but they never put it in.
5430684	5431364	That's kind of weird.
5431825	5432505	No, that is weird.
5433238	5441046	Um, it had a promo with the original arcade game where you could send in your score when all 50 levels are completed to get a free Road Blasters t-shirt.
5441927	5450696	Um, it had a toy tie-in by Matchbox so you get die-cast, um, cars that can be customized with armor, lasers, machine guns, rocket launchers, and jet engines.
5450816	5453339	There were the Turbo Force and the Motor Lords.
5454921	5458966	During the gameplay you get a slightly robotic sounding female voice that gives you advice.
5459867	5465114	And it has different phrases including hit it and eat lead road hog.
5466676	5470141	And when you use your nitro inject you get now that's cruising.
5472363	5474283	A guy with a last name that I can't pronounce.
5474363	5475524	I'm guessing it's a Polish name.
5475824	5485368	Stan Szczepanski holds the official Guinness World Record for Road Blaster.
5485388	5486688	At 2,216,120 points.
5486828	5489009	If you beat this, we'll give you some air.
5490490	5490870	And that's it.
5491090	5491510	Road Blasters.
5492817	5493418	All right.
5494118	5495099	Good classic game of the week.
5495119	5500143	I remember many bowling alley trips to play Road Blasters, among other things.
5501243	5502124	All right, let me shut up.
5502624	5503685	Okay, be quiet, Road Blasters.
5503705	5504606	We're done with you for now.
5505226	5505567	All right.
5506647	5507888	We're going to take a quick break, guys.
5508129	5508709	We're not done.
5509009	5511191	We're just going to take a little break to rest ourselves.
5511331	5512752	Bathroom break and what have you.
5512912	5514373	More coffee for DarkSakura.
5514453	5514954	No, break.
5515054	5516475	Or whatever she might need.
5516815	5517555	Garrus Break.
5517635	5528660	We will be back though in about six minutes with more, or if you're listening to us on the podcast, we'll be back in like six seconds with more of Orange Lounge Radio and of course we got the Rapid Fire News.
5529040	5535003	We've got your phone calls, your tweets, your emails, and Lord knows what else from Marissa.
5536484	5542546	In just about six minutes here live at the VOG Network or the Voice of Geeks Network.
5543387	5545528	We'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5545548	5546048	Don't go anywhere.
5551856	5556579	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5556639	5564084	We are live here on July the 29th of 2012 with the 467th episode of our show already in progress.
5564184	5565105	Big night tonight.
5566306	5569348	I was laughing so hard in part A that it hurts.
5569368	5577934	And if you have no idea what I'm talking about, I guess you'll have to tune into the podcast later, which Marissa will not be plugging on her Facebook, just for the record.
5577954	5580215	But Marissa is in studio joining us tonight.
5581656	5583457	Above all else, having a good time, I hope so.
5583557	5584717	Yes.
5585658	5594601	Not just Marissa having a good time with our show, but the folks participating in PlayStation Home Summerfest, the fan event going on right now.
5595021	5602304	We are in the Aurora 1.5 space, but to make sure you're in the right instance, you do want to make sure you follow somebody there.
5602444	5609606	I think Home Event Bot is no longer in there, if I was looking correctly earlier, but you could follow Black Wolf.
5609687	5610687	He is in there right now.
5611247	5616471	and so am I, GreenSky with IE at the end.
5616631	5620273	You can follow either one of us into the appropriate event space there.
5620293	5621894	It looks like Tigerclaw's in there as well.
5622355	5626177	So hopefully you can follow a friend into PlayStation Home.
5626517	5627878	It has thinned out a little bit.
5627938	5631461	It is getting later and later on the East Coast and some people have some other things to do tonight.
5631761	5635783	But to all you that are still there dancing and chatting along there...
5636724	5652149	a big thank you to staying up late with us here at the Voice of Geeks Network and listening to Orange Lounge Radio Black Wolf is in VOG chat and he's in the PlayStation Home space right now saying they are bubbling me in home now I don't want to know what that means
5652878	5654419	We're bubbling somebody, isn't it?
5654639	5654919	I don't know.
5655119	5656459	Is it what the floor was doing?
5657040	5658720	No, the floor makes those pretty effects.
5658840	5659180	I don't know.
5659701	5667223	All right, I'm being told to pick a number between 1 and 100 and say it on the air for another Blender giveaway.
5667303	5669424	He was awesome enough to give something away during... R!
5671805	5672986	The letter R will not work.
5673386	5676588	He was awesome enough to give something away during the Bobby Blackwell show and he's giving something away now.
5676948	5682692	Who knows what it could be, but I will let the lovely Marissa, because she's here tonight, pick that number between 1 and 100.
5682772	5683593	Marissa, what's it going to be?
5685174	5683593	3.
5686134	5687415	3!
5686374	5687415	She's lowballing it.
5687675	5688396	Alright, 1 and 100.
5688656	5694079	Please don't make any references to balls with me after the first one.
5694139	5695000	3 balls, Marissa?
5695040	5695700	Marissa, 3 balls?
5698843	5699223	Really?
5699744	5700024	All right.
5700104	5700664	Three it is.
5700744	5701585	That's the magic number.
5701725	5702065	Good luck.
5702626	5703146	Hope it's you.
5704267	5704747	I don't know.
5705127	5707809	I don't know what that's going to pick, but Blender will let us know.
5708290	5708570	All right.
5709530	5716055	Meanwhile, we're going to get back into some rapid fire news and some quick news stories.
5716555	5718076	And then the Fugo question of the week.
5718116	5720138	And I'll explain that for those that are new to the show.
5720558	5724642	I do want to once again welcome any new listeners we might have this week because of Summerfest or whatever.
5725162	5728305	If you don't know Orange Lounge Radio, we've been around for 10 years, believe it or not.
5728605	5732128	We started this show back in 2002, in June of 2002.
5733009	5746441	It was back then a show we created in support of the music gaming community, especially games like Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, Bust a Move or Bust a Groove, depending on what country you're from.
5747322	5767861	That whole series, everything music game related, especially DDR was the big arcade game DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all met playing DDR, if you can believe it At a place called Golfland, or sometimes we'd go to the bowling alley Or we'd drive all the way to Stockton, Loki Remember, we'd drive all the way to Stockton, Golfland to play DDR 5th Mix when they had that
5768450	5769571	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5795692	5816298	and talk some shit but you guys get to talk with us in the chat room via Skype via the mailbag and all of that good stuff and we really do care about what you guys have to say and that's why we call it the show where every gamer has a voice anyhow alright after that little reintroduction just for the folks new to our show tonight let's go to some rapid fire news and talk some shit Loki
5818069	5820450	I'm good at that, you know, talking shit and stuff.
5821130	5826012	So let's talk about one of my games that I'm very happy about, Grand Theft Auto 3.
5826492	5830233	Coming back to the PlayStation on the PlayStation Network.
5830533	5831634	Has it down a little title.
5832414	5834615	And it will be coming this Tuesday.
5834975	5841017	And that is the first of the kind of, you know, PlayStation 2 Grand Theft Auto games.
5841137	5842077	So pretty awesome.
5842097	5842777	It's going to be $10.
5843378	5844698	So check that out if you can.
5845956	5867391	or if you're like me, buy the old copy because I have an original Playstation 3 rub it in, rub it in, rub it in so I can play my original copy of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with hot coffee can't wait you know what I'm waiting for, speaking of Grand Theft Auto aside from 5 where the fuck is Retro City Rampage I want that game now
5867984	5868404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5886443	5893049	I didn't talk about this during my gaming week because it's not really a game, but we finally went and saw Batman on Tuesday, and they played a trailer for that.
5893649	5897232	They played a video game trailer before the movie, which I thought was interesting.
5898273	5900195	You know how movie theaters do this now?
5900235	5902077	I'm sure every movie theater in America does this now.
5902277	5911765	You go to the movie, and before the trailers start, there's just the 20 minutes of basically commercials that they call, I don't know, what is it, First Look or The 20 or something, where it's just...
5912506	5913006	It's just commercials.
5913026	5914686	Gotta get here to see our advertisements.
5914706	5914947	That's right.
5914967	5916527	Get here early and see our ads.
5916627	5918147	Yeah, you consumer whore.
5919167	5922248	And they were showing a trailer for that Modern Warfare 2.
5923588	5925909	And Alan leans over to me and goes, this looks bad.
5925989	5926469	What is this?
5926509	5927309	This doesn't look good.
5927329	5929690	And I'm like, it's a shoot-em game, honey.
5929730	5930310	You wouldn't like it.
5930350	5931270	It's a great game.
5931390	5933991	He doesn't know what he's talking about.
5934031	5940312	No, seriously, the new one's actually being, you know, kind of ties in with Batman because it's being written by the guy that did... Yes, I was in the ads.
5940452	5940812	And so...
5942463	5942983	It looks good.
5943243	5944644	There's some new stuff that they're adding.
5945784	5948885	It'll be the first Modern Warfare game that I'm actually going to get at launch.
5949865	5950945	I'm finally caught up.
5952526	5953866	Except it's not really Modern Warfare.
5953886	5954946	I mean, it's Future Warfare.
5956027	5958687	Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about arcade games.
5958728	5962409	And I actually have Rumblefish on my arcade cabinet.
5962809	5965950	I haven't really played a whole ton of it, but I have it emulated.
5966430	5970991	And it was a game that was on Sammy's Autonomous Way, or was it
5972572	5974493	Atomos Wave, Arcade Hardware.
5974633	5977575	They had a lot of other stuff like Dolphin Blue and stuff.
5978075	5978856	And it was a fighting game.
5978896	5979676	It was pretty awesome.
5979797	5985280	Well, Dimps, the company behind it, I guess, picked up the rights to it.
5985440	5989723	And now they're going to be re-releasing it on consoles.
5990023	5991965	Or not consoles, I'm sorry, in arcades.
5992405	5996848	And they're bringing Rumble Fish 2 to arcades.
5997348	5998409	Which was in 2005.
5998769	6000190	And now it's coming back.
6001870	6005973	And I guess it's on this new, was it Nessica Live?
6006394	6007675	Or Nessica Cross Live?
6007955	6018964	It's kind of a streaming platform, but it's a platform where arcade owners can actually download games to cabinets.
6019604	6019885	Kind of...
6020565	6021927	Digital download of arcade games.
6021947	6022788	That's interesting.
6022968	6027373	I'm surprised that's only just now becoming a thing because that makes an awful lot of sense.
6027894	6030597	I forgot a shout out I wanted to do at Startup Part B. I'm so sorry.
6030617	6031498	This is so important.
6031959	6034001	I'm so pissed I didn't get to go this year.
6034341	6035883	I mean, I'm just juggling priorities.
6035923	6036344	Dan went.
6036704	6051330	Yeah, California Extreme was this weekend, and I got sent pictures and video, and apparently they had a full-on Chuck E. Cheese animatronic, I don't know if it was Chuck E. Cheese, but one of the likes, animatronic band that would sit there and creepily play songs, because I got sent a video of one.
6051370	6052271	I should show this to Marissa.
6052291	6052611	That's awesome.
6053071	6053191	Right.
6053211	6060133	So, I mean, you never really think of that because there's a lot of Chuck E. Cheese's that have closed down or just upgraded and stuff.
6060793	6064374	I hope I didn't get that wrong, but it's that style.
6064774	6067595	I would love to have the old Bullwinkle's stuff.
6067775	6068575	Maybe that's what this is.
6068595	6068915	I don't know.
6068935	6070575	Anyway, I'm going to hand that to Marissa.
6070635	6073156	Hit play and hold it so that Loki can see it too.
6073556	6074957	That way you guys can kind of check that out.
6074977	6076597	That's why I was sent from California Extreme.
6079700	6081721	and they're singing Total Eclipse of the Heart.
6082582	6083983	That is pretty amazing.
6084003	6085844	That would give me nightmares.
6087205	6088185	Neil sent that there.
6089146	6092488	I would just put that out in my front yard all year round.
6093848	6096650	He had a matronic band.
6096870	6100312	It's Halloween, put a fucking pumpkin in front of them.
6100512	6102394	It's Christmas, put Santa hats on them.
6104135	6105358	So shout out to California Stream.
6105438	6106842	I'm so sorry I couldn't make it this year.
6107083	6108466	The shadow casting was this weekend too.
6108486	6109790	You know what would only make that thing better?
6110070	6110271	Huh?
6110973	6112497	If they would fucking just, you know...
6114255	6117916	I have arcade hardware I guess I could download games to.
6117936	6120557	Not entirely legally, but you know.
6138942	6140743	Still, that's a cool idea, I guess.
6143485	6145766	Alright, and then of course, this is kind of cool.
6146347	6148508	I know a game that we kind of liked a while back.
6149208	6150009	Puzzle Quest.
6150689	6152911	They put out a couple games and kind of disappeared.
6153791	6155312	But now Puzzle Quest is coming back.
6155773	6164959	Apparently this is kind of... Because Firement, the company that put out the game, I guess they...
6168169	6193244	Firemint is now putting out the game because they purchased Infinite Interactive which was the original creator of the game and so now it's coming back Puzzle Quest 2 is pretty awesome and it was on like every system out there and I'm not talking about the Galactic one that didn't do so well but the actual Puzzle Quest 2 was really good Puzzle Quest is a pretty cool game I wasn't a fan of the Galactic one but I would be down for more of the old Puzzle Quest
6193871	6195532	Puzzle Pirates Puzzle Pirates
6218109	6220510	Alright, I got a couple stories for you guys here.
6221051	6224553	First one is about New Super Mario Bros.
6224893	6224553	2.
6225313	6228395	Did you know it had a working title called New Super Mario Bros.
6228555	6229015	Gold?
6229095	6230656	In fact, that was supposed to be the name.
6231257	6232818	And you know, they've kind of been saying this a lot.
6233478	6234999	Even at E3 when they were talking about it.
6235239	6237181	What does Mario love more than anything?
6237261	6238201	Gold coins!
6238261	6239562	And this new game's all about coins.
6239582	6240483	Smoke and shrooms.
6240683	6252632	Well, apparently, it was about, excuse me, it was so much a part of the game that it was originally going to be called New Super Mario Bros.
6252892	6253273	Gold.
6253613	6255855	But yeah, they went back and called it New Super Mario Bros.
6255875	6255955	Gold.
6255975	6261879	But they were worried that too many people would think it's just, you know, cheapy or a cheap rehash of the first one.
6261899	6262039	Yeah.
6263180	6264161	Thanks for watching!
6278386	6286550	A comment from Crytek is our next story about the Wii U. We've been getting more and more developers commenting on this.
6287170	6292713	Producer Mike Reed mentioned that Crytek is talking about working with Nintendo.
6292833	6297175	A version of Crysis 3 for Wii U should not be ruled out.
6297596	6302518	He would not confirm if it's in development or not, but it's sounding pretty likely.
6302698	6305820	Here's a quote from ComputerVideoGames.com.
6306460	6307120	Thank you for watching!
6333510	6335951	I mean, come on.
6336431	6339793	Their hardware is pretty much on par with the current consoles.
6339873	6341574	It's not that hard to port that over.
6341634	6343735	I mean, they're porting other games over.
6343795	6346096	So, yes, of course there's going to be that.
6346496	6352879	I think what the stipulation is going to be, what's Nintendo require from these people putting out stuff for their platform?
6353199	6356861	Are they making them, hey, you've got to have some unique gameplay that involves their tablet.
6357862	6360363	And them figuring out, well, how are we going to...
6362404	6367289	GameStop, Target, some of them have the console backordered
6382225	6385046	Some best buys and so forth are just now getting stock in again.
6385406	6386467	Here's the thing, though.
6386847	6402653	Most people are drawing from this that either Nintendo's about to do a new holiday bundle, so they're trying to get rid of what's on shelves now, or this is in preparation for the Wii U. They might be trying to clean out the old stuff a little bit to make room for the Wii U. Loki, any insider thoughts from your perspective?
6402853	6403053	Well...
6403613	6406094	I haven't seen a lot of demand for the systems.
6406274	6409814	I would think if they're trying to clear out stock that they wouldn't be on backorder.
6409854	6415036	They would be in plentiful supply because they're trying to get rid of them.
6415336	6419236	I don't think Nintendo is sitting on consoles right now.
6420997	6424058	It could just be that they're switching production from...
6426559	6427661	Who knows how long it's going to be.
6427681	6437981	I'm assuming that they've got to start producing these consoles, so maybe they're starting to switch over some of those manufacturers that are doing the Wii to making the Wii U system instead, just to get prepared.
6439660	6442142	DarkSakura's Stories GameGuru Why isn't Wario the villain here?
6442162	6442783	He loves coins.
6457697	6458298	Golf clap, golf clap
6486854	6488256	DarkSakura.com
6503032	6504715	So there's two different DLC packs.
6504875	6507519	One of them, like I said, is the Disney Princesses.
6508681	6512026	The costume pack one has Aurora, Cinderella, Jasmine, and Snow White.
6512126	6516372	And then the second one is Belle, Tiana, Rapunzel, and Ariel.
6517193	6517474	Yay.
6519008	6522991	Then, we have some information about Dance Central 3.
6524312	6528975	We have the songs that are going to be out on it.
6529976	6533859	As some of these people, I really do not know who they are.
6533879	6534879	I mean, some of them I do.
6535400	6538682	To anyone, whoever the fuck that is, I am the best.
6538882	6540323	We have Alice DJ, Better Off Alone.
6540423	6541084	Fucking love that song.
6542484	6543445	I love that song.
6544185	6550908	JJ Fad, Lil Jon and the East Side Boys featuring Yin Yang Twins, whatever.
6551688	6554209	LMFAO, Los Del Rio.
6554529	6557630	We have Maroon 5 with moves like Jagger.
6557710	6558931	I actually really like that song.
6559631	6561212	We have Ice Ice Baby.
6562512	6565974	We have Vicky Sue Robinson, Turn the Beat Around, and Village People YMCA.
6568860	6570463	Whatever happened to Alice DJ?
6570904	6572808	That was like my college years right there.
6572848	6574050	Alice DJ is better off alone.
6575052	6575634	Apparently.
6577037	6583021	And then, last but never least, the Nintendo 3DS XL UK price.
6583961	6585802	This is going to be $179.99.
6587323	6588344	Again, that's in pounds.
6589465	6595288	So, Tesco's, however, will be offering the device for 175 pounds.
6596329	6598350	So, you want it cheap, get it at Tesco's.
6600605	6609873	Game, one more, has a trade-in deal that for $79.99 you can trade in an old boxed 3DS and get the 3DS XL.
6611395	6611855	So that's that.
6612455	6612856	Not bad.
6613216	6614157	Not bad, not bad.
6615718	6617500	All right, moving on.
6617580	6622184	We have a segment we always do here on Orange Lawns Radio called the Fugle Question of the Week.
6624366	6625466	You might be asking yourself...
6628618	6629960	What the hell is a foogle?
6631663	6634787	Put Facebook and Google Plus together and you get foogle.
6635368	6635969	That is what it is.
6636389	6640856	We ask a question each week in our Facebook and Google Plus communities and you guys answer it.
6640916	6641857	Here's this week's question.
6643086	6650848	There's a couple betas going on right now, including Guild Wars 2, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and Sony PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, just to name a few.
6651589	6656290	Have you ever made a decision whether or not to buy a game based off the beta?
6656950	6665613	Considering that betas are unfinished products, do you think that it was a fair decision, or should a company not put it out there if it's not ready to be judged?
6667208	6669270	I thought it was a good question, not just because I thought of it.
6670692	6672353	So let's get to some of these comments here.
6673354	6676858	I want to start with Google Plus tonight.
6677999	6680081	And yes, there are people posting on Google Plus.
6680682	6682164	A quick impression of Google Plus.
6682524	6682964	Hello!
6683685	6684626	Hello, hello!
6685807	6688730	No, we have two comments from Google Plus tonight.
6689871	6691733	There's at least two people using Google+.
6692934	6693875	Some weeks we get four.
6694836	6701941	Alright, Redertainment says, No, but I did buy cakes prolonging the magic after listening to Alpha Beta Parking Lot.
6702142	6703823	Is he plugging something?
6703903	6704824	I don't know.
6705785	6707106	Had nothing to do with the question, sir.
6708120	6710243	However, FlacoJones responded saying,
6723180	6726563	Yeah, that was a beta that ended up being pretty accurate, I gotta say.
6726643	6729025	Good reminder, FlacoJones.
6730086	6732108	Going to Facebook for some of the comments from Facebook.
6732188	6742558	Amanda, Amanda R says, I've played in betas that were out only a couple weeks before game release, and by this time, these are mostly finished products with only minor tweaks being made.
6743058	6768870	I've made the decision to not buy a game when it came out because the beta was just not fun and with that close to the release not enough changes were going to be made to change the game in any significant way Cody T says I've played betas of a million games and I think I've bought most I think betas are more for the developer than for the consumer it's a cheap way to see exactly what is wrong with the game by the best judge us and it's a way for the gamer to be involved in the actual development of the game
6771081	6791198	Nick M responds saying I believe a public or large closed beta is the only responsible decision for game companies if their game relies heavily on multiplayer due to the large amount of problems that will often otherwise show their head on launch day however more often than not betas talk me out of buying games that I'm already on the fence about
6792735	6800681	Boshka responded and said, Yes, the only game I have ever done it for is a game that's actually free when it comes out, Path of Exile.
6800761	6803143	Think Diablo 2 with new features and updated graphics.
6803724	6809228	I donated $10 not only to get a second beta key for a friend, but because I love what they're doing with that game.
6809268	6810649	If I could get more, I would.
6811190	6814232	Blizzard should take some notes on how to make a good action RPG.
6814512	6815353	Ooh, sick burn.
6817031	6817692	I think it's fair.
6817792	6819553	People have to learn what a beta is for.
6819653	6820474	It's not a demo.
6820494	6822216	You're testing buggy code.
6822496	6826319	You're testing builds that are normally four to five builds behind what the devs have.
6826700	6829742	Some games basically require betas based on the sheer size.
6829822	6838110	For example, in the Mists of Pandaria beta, they changed one ability for a boss fight and the next thing you know, there's an elevator coming out of the ground on another continent.
6838670	6850892	if the company says before that it's not a demo it's a beta I think that is completely fair if you don't get the difference you're not the type of tester they want anyway a long but good comment from Boshka let's see
6852208	6852828	Wicked says,
6873895	6883345	Sometimes the game does not live up to the overhype that sometimes follows certain open betas, or some good games could easily be overlooked due to negative reactions to betas.
6883806	6889652	So while betas can easily help a game's development, it could easily skew the game's anticipation in the public eye.
6890934	6894578	And lastly, Chiggers responds saying, I've bought games based on the demos.
6894818	6895479	Does that count?
6897753	6899355	Demos are a little different than betas.
6899735	6905780	I think kind of going back to the other points, like betas are put out there because they're not supposed to be demos.
6905800	6907481	They're supposed to be tests for the developers.
6907581	6913106	But kind of where I was trying to go with the question is that a lot of people look at betas as demos in this day and age.
6913266	6918710	Is that fair or should the developers be real and realize that's how most people are going to view it?
6919551	6923872	Anyhow, thanks for all those answers on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
6924993	6930555	I didn't read them all, so please go check out the post to read some of the other great insights from this week.
6930615	6931595	Really appreciate it, guys.
6931775	6934996	Sorry I couldn't read them all, but it's only a three-hour show.
6937497	6937797	All right.
6938017	6944179	Oh, by the way, X-Link giving me the update in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6944679	6946180	Here's what happened to Alice DJ.
6948277	6958400	Quote, after the group went their separate ways, Prank decided to move on to other ventures by putting her music career aside to become a makeup artist and beauty fashion consultant.
6960021	6961201	I remember the video.
6961241	6963782	She was a very hip looking gal.
6963822	6964402	I remember that.
6964422	6967743	They actually had like two videos for that song, Better Off Alone.
6968483	6968803	Anyhow.
6969363	6971384	Well, I learned something tonight about Alice DJ.
6971424	6971784	Who knew?
6972624	6975325	I've learned about pornography and I've learned about Alice DJ.
6977799	6979080	Marissa's hiding her head.
6979160	6979940	This is adorable.
6981941	6982541	Loki!
6982722	6985483	What do you got for us next in other gaming news?
6986103	6986423	All right.
6987024	6991266	So let's talk a little bit about Rock Band.
6991326	6992346	And this is kind of funny because...
6993829	6998112	I don't know if you guys remember, a couple months back we had a scare where, hey, guess what?
6998152	7001735	You know Rock Band that you purchase on iOS and stuff like that?
7001955	7003176	It's being delisted.
7003236	7004357	It's being taken away.
7005117	7006458	And you know that game you just purchased?
7006478	7011822	Well, now it's going to be completely useless because you're not going to be able to get anything anymore for it.
7011882	7013323	And it's just going to be gone.
7014564	7017486	Well, and you may remember that they came out and said, oh, no, no, no.
7017906	7018547	That's not happening.
7019367	7020448	That message was sent an error.
7020628	7021469	Well, the error was that
7022697	7026618	It was sent two months early because now, yes, they are actually delisting the game.
7028319	7031600	Well, I don't think people were mad that the game was being delisted.
7031660	7032320	I mean, whatever.
7032540	7035141	People are pissed if it wouldn't work anymore.
7035381	7041803	That was the original, like, scare campaign going around is that, ha ha, you just bought this game and none of your DLC or anything's going to work anymore.
7042044	7042644	LOL, bye.
7043964	7045646	But that doesn't appear to be the case.
7045846	7047887	If they're just pulling it from the store, then whatever.
7048008	7058035	Well, they're pulling basically the Rock Band iOS game and Rock Band Reloaded iOS game and I think all the DLC for it as well.
7058596	7062839	Yes, you will not be able to purchase any more DLC for it.
7063960	7069004	And that's supposed to happen effective July 31st, so a couple days from now.
7072529	7074130	Well, yeah.
7074631	7081396	As a musician, which actually just means unemployed.
7084718	7094986	With regard to the music games, especially guitar players, games like Guitar Hero, especially at the time, at its height, really enraged musicians.
7095006	7098769	They got so angry, especially since a lot of people were misinformed and they...
7100689	7104850	I've even heard a lot of people ignorantly at GameStop believing that it could teach you how to play guitar.
7105431	7112252	However, my friend's mother ended up winning a free copy of Rocksmith, so we played it.
7112833	7117814	That was actually one where they gave you an XLR cable and you could actually plug in your guitar to the Xbox.
7118434	7119595	That actually was a pretty good game.
7120135	7122157	You plug in your own guitar to it.
7123317	7130002	I had guitar players play it and they actually found it challenging and interesting and it actually accurately presented theory and things like that.
7131088	7132070	I'm glad you said that.
7132450	7142501	You didn't know this before you said that, but I usually have to refrain from comment on that game because a really good friend of mine knows somebody that's a big part of the development of that game.
7142902	7148107	So I usually don't try to avoid the topic on the show because of conflict, but I'm glad you said that.
7148228	7150130	I'm sure that'll make somebody very happy to know that.
7150464	7165897	Yeah, I didn't get that far into the game, but I enjoyed it, and I think that, you know, it's not going to turn you into a virtuoso, but I mean, you know, if you're too cheap to go get lessons immediately, it's a good place to start, just to get a very basic foundation, and it's fun.
7166621	7196450	yeah I understand that game does have kind of quite a bit of like a cultish audience I don't want to sound like but like a lot of the makeup of I think who's into that game is kind of like people who are rediscovering getting into music maybe at a later age like it's not like kids and teenagers and so forth playing it that rock band tends to skew towards like college parties and stuff but like Rocksmith is like 30 somethings who always wanted to learn to play an instrument that never did I wasn't familiar with that I wish that they had I guess it didn't that's my impression it's not like just my impression of it
7196830	7201014	I guess, you know, my understanding is, you know, it didn't blow up necessarily.
7201054	7206678	But, I mean, I wish that it had a wider library of music.
7206758	7208119	You know, it started to when it came out.
7208139	7209320	They started releasing stuff all the time.
7209340	7210621	But I wish it had more, you know.
7211281	7213904	But, you know, that's just selfishly because I think it'd be fun to play.
7214284	7215805	Well, they do DLC pretty regularly.
7216105	7218867	And you're in luck because they have Rocksmith and Bass.
7219548	7221870	Or Guitar and Bass coming out this October.
7221890	7221970	Yeah.
7222850	7227511	You don't need a game to teach you bass.
7228251	7229111	I'm kidding.
7229191	7230872	I'm kidding, actually.
7231292	7232852	It does require talent.
7233572	7234332	Just not a lot.
7235553	7237153	Don't be a retarded monkey.
7237813	7238833	No, actually, no.
7239353	7240194	I have friends like Freebo.
7240234	7241694	I have friends who are excellent bass players.
7242354	7244654	And all the running musicians joke, making fun of bass players.
7245395	7246055	Good times.
7246135	7246655	Good times.
7249216	7250217	Are you a fan of Green Day?
7251378	7252899	I like Green Day, but let's be real.
7252939	7257502	A lot of their songs are kind of like the same chord over and over, and it cracked me up because he was sitting there.
7257982	7260224	He's going to be the guy that's lead singer of that band.
7260244	7264247	He's going to be one of the, not like a judge, but like a mentor or something on The Voice.
7264867	7266828	But he's working with Christina Aguilera.
7267389	7270651	And I don't know why, but I found that to be like the funniest thing I'd heard all week.
7270951	7283324	Okay, you're not going to appreciate this, but any other musicians listening to this and the band that now knows my embarrassing past that I've told to tune into will appreciate this.
7285286	7288749	Green Day is kind of like the Creedence Clearwater of their time.
7290511	7291753	I know that sounds obtuse.
7292373	7297897	But there's always this joke that Creedence Clearwater's songs and John Fogarty's songs only require three chords to play.
7299098	7303081	There is something to be said about Green Day's later artistic merit.
7303581	7310046	There are things to be appreciated about it, but do I think that they should be held in that high of a regard?
7310627	7310827	No.
7311667	7313008	I'm not a member of the cult, though.
7314209	7317392	I appreciate some of the things that they've done, but I'm not a cult member or anything.
7318012	7325874	You know, and it's amazing where they've come, you know, singing songs about acne and masturbation to... With guitars that were out of tune.
7325894	7328334	To, like, commentary on President Bush and so forth.
7328374	7328694	Exactly.
7328774	7329835	And that Broadway play.
7329895	7331655	They've come so... Oh, God.
7331735	7334196	Marissa, you all right over there?
7334216	7338977	I like, you know, like, Green Day songs with, you know, fussy moves.
7342446	7346076	Stan in our chatroom, you are spurring some music discussion in our chatroom.
7346116	7348222	Stan says, same with Hanson.
7348664	7350228	Mbop is only three chords.
7352813	7354193	They didn't even have three hits.
7357414	7359815	They had like 30 babies between them all, though.
7359835	7360415	What was that old joke?
7360435	7362816	Yeah, the girl at Hanson's pretty cute.
7366137	7367977	No, they're actually all evangelicals.
7367997	7368718	That's all really weird.
7368758	7373639	That means Justin Bieber is like the Hanson of our time, basically.
7373759	7375719	Doesn't Justin Bieber have his own video game now, too?
7376400	7377260	Oh, God, I hope not.
7377765	7378726	People don't understand.
7378746	7380647	Teenage girls are stupid.
7381568	7383309	I said this is a former teenage girl.
7387193	7392557	As one who was once a teenage girl, I have authority on this subject.
7392737	7393017	I do.
7393497	7396540	I mean, granted, I never had bought posters on my wall or anything.
7397143	7398023	No, no, no, no, dear.
7398164	7399664	This is what you get for being younger than me.
7400565	7401465	I had new kids on the block.
7402245	7403466	Everyone can shut up.
7403486	7407608	The kids at my school called me Daria.
7411109	7412950	So I was very much the anti that.
7412970	7422974	But the thing that people don't get about this, and of course, yes, it's interesting how the media will exploit everything when it comes to a tween star like this, including the areas of video games and apps and all this crap.
7422994	7424035	But it's just...
7424995	7442332	just they just found a boy to fill the slot of cute teenage boy singing songs to seduce it could have been anyone you know they just to just put him in the spot and they put the marketing you know movement behind him and done it could have been anybody had nothing to do with who Justin Bieber is nothing sorry
7442592	7443713	I just opened Pandora's box.
7459002	7469405	If Katy Perry gets her own movie, I should have my own quadruple sequel and then miniseries and TV shows.
7470506	7473006	Let's face it, she got the movie because of her titties.
7476604	7484590	I mean, she has some cute songs, blah, blah, blah, but mainly it's because she's beautiful, you know, and people like talking about her boobies, apparently.
7484610	7485410	And Elmo.
7485811	7487972	So, I deserve my own series.
7488052	7489753	You should be a Star Trek next to that.
7490394	7495517	You should be like four TV series, what is it, like nine movies and fanfic.
7495677	7499720	Yeah, if her movies alone get her a movie, I deserve so much more.
7500240	7500621	Yeah.
7501348	7503130	But then, here's what fascinates me.
7504070	7505832	Katy Perry has some catchy songs, whatever.
7506893	7508294	When you're drunk at a gay bar, you don't care.
7508374	7509135	Oh, Katy Perry!
7509195	7510316	I love her!
7510877	7512838	She's a big marketing team, too.
7513459	7514220	She's kind of a tool.
7514740	7520425	But then, you have LCD Sound System had their big farewell thing and all that.
7520865	7521586	What did they get?
7521646	7523468	They got a Fathom event.
7524088	7524769	They got like
7525336	7528658	They're movies like one night only at the local cinema.
7530460	7531060	Life is not fair.
7531160	7534923	Before the Metropolitan Opera, you know, movie theater night, you know.
7536204	7536844	Poor guys.
7537004	7537305	All right.
7538605	7538946	Anyhow.
7540327	7544069	Actdeft in our chat room says, Marissa, the movie 2, Electit Bubalu.
7544089	7548452	That should be the name of your next album.
7548893	7549253	All right.
7549813	7550614	Moving on.
7552028	7553391	That's how Katy Perry sells shit.
7553451	7554173	I can do it too.
7555596	7559425	You just, you just, you gotta get out of the Lilith Fair and get into the pop music.
7559465	7559946	You just need to...
7560818	7565340	Just whine about a boy who broke up with you years ago or something.
7565980	7567340	Just sing about Dave Coulier.
7570201	7575923	Insult the women that actually are gay and can't help it and pretend to be a lesbian to amuse men.
7575983	7576483	It's great.
7577764	7579044	Get in a pillow fight.
7579104	7580284	Braid somebody's hair.
7581505	7582645	Freeze someone's bra.
7583606	7584266	We used to do that.
7584306	7587827	Dip a bra in orange juice and put it in the freezer for the first girl who fell asleep.
7589581	7589941	That's hot.
7589981	7590422	Keep talking.
7590782	7591042	All right.
7591662	7592423	Moving on.
7593763	7594023	Okay.
7594764	7600607	This is bad because we're going to go from such humorous, happy discussions to really unfortunate situations.
7603302	7607984	I'm about to Debbie Downer the show a little bit and talk about some layoffs.
7610225	7611125	Stop laughing, Marissa.
7611146	7611886	Inappropriate.
7612966	7614467	No, this news really does suck.
7615388	7616908	Maybe we should skip this story.
7617569	7619070	Go, go.
7619210	7619970	Read it already.
7620030	7620970	We need variety.
7621431	7623772	Uh-oh, Marissa's choking.
7625933	7626233	All right.
7628254	7628935	Serious face.
7630805	7636529	Microsoft laid off a small, as they put it, number of positions at their Vancouver-based development studio.
7636869	7643032	This is because Project Columbia, whatever this was, we don't know what the real name was, it got canceled.
7643173	7644633	It's off the books now.
7644693	7646875	It was supposed to be an educational Connect title.
7647235	7648716	It was going to educate young people.
7648796	7651357	It was going to pair books with music and illustrations.
7651758	7655280	I guess it had something to do with the Sesame Workshop as well.
7655320	7660203	That doesn't necessarily mean it was a Sesame Street game, but it sounds like it was something that was kind of geared towards kids.
7660783	7688758	or the like Wonderbook Connect and then they saw the Wonderbook presentation like wow that looks like shit and then they're like woo scrap that perhaps but layoffs are never good news especially also when they hit Warner Brothers Seattle also had some layoffs hit them this week they were currently working on Lord of the Rings Guardians of Middle Earth and if you might be thinking to yourself god they're still making Lord of the Rings games well there's a Hobbit movie coming out at the end of the year you might have heard of it it's a big deal
7689378	7690639	So yeah, moolah moolah.
7691260	7693441	Unfortunately, not enough moolah, apparently.
7693922	7705731	Layoffs hit the studio once back in November that was supposed to be 60 people, and a statement from WB says, quote, due to shifting business imperatives, Warner Brothers Games Seattle has made staff reductions.
7705811	7709514	The group will continue to remain an integral part of Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment.
7710075	7710375	Yikes.
7710956	7714318	Now, since I would like to end with a little bit of a positive...
7715559	7719142	ID Software, ID Software, you know, they made like Doom and shit.
7719162	7722524	Okay, they are actually hiring right now.
7723025	7731851	They are hiring on their website for a UI programmer job for, quote, an unannounced game on future generation consoles.
7732372	7736615	So could it be something that is a sequel to one of the past franchises?
7736975	7742840	Possibly, because the listing actually says, quote, familiarity with ID Software games, characters, brands, and universes.
7743260	7743500	DarkSakura
7764958	7771927	Okay, well, in other news... How about something about that PlayStation All-Stars crap that's coming out?
7772728	7773689	Oh, you think it's crap?
7774610	7775070	I don't know.
7775090	7776552	That's how you really feel.
7776732	7777774	Actually, we're gonna have beta.
7777854	7780036	Somebody we know very well has been in the beta.
7780056	7781598	We're gonna have beta impressions in a little bit.
7782640	7784422	I'm not necessarily going to call it crap.
7784462	7785844	I'm going to call it potential crap.
7786785	7798340	So there are some people who have gone through the data files for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale and has nine stages, eight characters, and a bunch of other stuff.
7799521	7820816	What we have is a Bioshock Infinite stage, Sir Daniel Fortescue from Medieval, Dante from Devil May Cry, Spike from Ape Escape, Raiden from Metal Gear Solid, Nariko from Heavenly Sword, and we've got David Hader saying he's recording dialogue.
7822262	7826784	Dante, Evil Cole, Nariko, Raiden, Sackboy, Ratchet & Clank, Sir Daniel Fortescue, Spike Atomizer
7846154	7869794	the Balmusu Axe, Boots of Hermes, Freeze Missile, Golf Club from Hot Shots Golf, Gravity Shield from Wipeout, Hedgehog Grenade, the Dovat Laser Designator, Leech Beam, Murder of Crows from Bioshock, Railgun, Razor Claws, RPG, Scythe, Spear, Sonic Rift, and Sackbot.
7871075	7887388	and then supporting characters as in Minions, Captain Quark, Kai from Heavenly Sword, Kat from Devil May Cry, Kia, Monkey from Ape Escape, Nyx, Pierre from Doko Demo Isho, Sackbot, and Sam from Metal Gear Rising.
7888048	7897656	And then it says, there's like just a bunch of modes, but as far as stage goes, there's Alden's Tower, Black Rock Stadium, Columbia, Franzia from Loco Roco.
7897996	7898917	That actually looks pretty neat.
7899717	7901758	Isn't Franzia boxed wine as well?
7902038	7903119	No, that's Franzia.
7903519	7904440	This is Franzia.
7904620	7905180	Oh, my bad.
7907241	7908662	Marissa and I think alike.
7909362	7909822	Tip it!
7910103	7911543	Tip it, Kathleen, tip it!
7911743	7916146	We think like old 50-year-old... I'm sorry, I think of Kathy Griffin.
7916186	7917066	I do too.
7917106	7921308	San Francisco from Resistance, Stowaways from Uncharted, Time Station from Ape Escape.
7922029	7924450	So yeah, I'm most excited about LocoRoco stage, really.
7925711	7928332	And all these were hacked from files from the beta.
7928803	7928983	Yes.
7930204	7930944	Hacker's gonna hack.
7931504	7932285	Exactly.
7932605	7933686	People should know that by now.
7933806	7934686	Hack like what?
7935407	7937027	I'm looking forward to playing as Parappa.
7937728	7938728	I think the game looks fun.
7938808	7940750	Yeah.
7941110	7945572	I'll let the person who's gonna review the beta in a minute here, which we just talked about.
7945612	7946873	You shouldn't do that, but hey.
7946893	7954077	And that is, I believe, against the end-user license agreement, or was it the confidentiality agreement?
7954877	7957219	This... We ain't the ones gonna get sued over it.
7958180	7958760	Ain't our asses.
7958821	7959281	It's not me.
7959461	7960462	It's not me playing it.
7960922	7962243	I got a special tipster.
7962564	7970590	We'll break out the voice disguiser and the shadow everything so they aren't identified.
7970630	7973893	Well, this person's using someone else's beta.
7974353	7977916	So it's even like... I know, right?
7978977	7979317	Anyhow.
7982039	7982620	Moving on.
7983260	7983521	Loki.
7985424	7987185	I wish I was in a beta test for that game.
7988106	7988746	Looks awesome.
7989707	8013921	I was like, give me the logon and password so I can get into... So there was a hack that was demonstrated by a Russian hacker using basically a way to spoof the Apple Store servers to allow him to make free in-app purchases.
8014861	8015742	and DarkSakura.
8043351	8045692	In other words, it's going to slow everything down.
8047092	8049153	So thank you for ruining it for everybody.
8049233	8049753	Appreciate that.
8049793	8057735	Of course, it's going to require that these people that publish these apps are going to need to update their apps with a new API for it.
8059856	8062319	I don't know how they're going to... How's that really going to work?
8062379	8072130	Like, say, for example, I use that glitch or whatever or that exploit to purchase a bunch of tower bucks or something in Tiny Tower and then I spend all of them.
8072350	8074132	How are you going to take that away?
8074933	8077255	I mean, I don't see how it's going to work.
8077355	8078717	I don't think you can at that point.
8078897	8082641	I don't think for consumables like that, I don't think you can actually do anything.
8082982	8092352	I see, like, okay, if I purchase, you know, songs from Rock Band or something like that, it's going to check to make sure that I actually purchased those and then go from there, but
8094707	8095187	Thanks for watching!
8119892	8120933	Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed
8144570	8150433	He's basically implying that the characters could be different depending on which platform you purchase the game on.
8150973	8151253	Quote,
8163659	8167662	Over all the different platforms, this totals up to 29 actual playable choices.
8168063	8171506	But that doesn't mean there are 29 playable choices in all platforms.
8171906	8174008	In fact, no single platform has all 29.
8174748	8177771	Some drop down to the low 20s, some instead have high 20s.
8178191	8178791	Why is this?
8178952	8182234	Well, some platforms have characters that are unique to that platform.
8182594	8185257	I'm not going to say which, that's part of the fun of the reveals.
8185717	8187799	Some are Sega characters, some are not.
8188239	8189240	Don't bother asking.
8189918	8192320	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8214296	8224542	And I believe the reason why it's exclusive on the Nintendo platforms is also they're kicking in some money for marketing as well for the Activision game.
8224662	8226303	So it makes sense.
8226823	8227183	It does.
8227203	8227704	It does.
8228924	8229405	All right.
8229465	8233347	Well, let's take a look at our mailbag.
8233367	8236209	Yeah.
8240129	8244611	Every week, DarkSakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and reads a few emails for you.
8244711	8252233	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Now, DarkSakura, when you weren't here last week, there was like eight emails sent to the show.
8252774	8255274	So we only read half of them and we saved the other half for you.
8255354	8257115	Well, there's three that I saw.
8257255	8259276	These might be the leftovers from last week.
8259396	8259716	Okay.
8259996	8260996	Well, this is July 22nd, so...
8262997	8265239	Um, greetings OLR, it's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8265359	8268841	I just wanted to share how much I love Steam sales and boo to Origin.
8269822	8274465	As someone who doesn't need many games on release days, I always wait for the Steam sales.
8274645	8275986	I can't wait for this holiday.
8276446	8279749	If you want, please share the damage that Steam did to each of you.
8280189	8282130	You're a loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle.
8282210	8284652	And I think I just bought Borderlands, that's all.
8285052	8290602	We ended up actually talking about the Steam sale last week a little bit, so I'll kind of point you back to that show.
8290662	8293808	But DarkSakura, that was the only damage it did to you, was Borderlands?
8294008	8294549	Yeah, pretty much.
8294710	8295932	Well, we'll have to play together sometime.
8297065	8298085	I have to actually install it.
8298586	8299626	Marissa, you ever use Steam?
8299666	8303107	I know you're not a huge, huge gamer girl, but you like the adventure games.
8303147	8307229	I gotta say, Steam is a good place to look for some of the newer stuff if you're into adventure games.
8307269	8307609	I don't know.
8307809	8311191	I have not, but I probably should because I have the same recommendation as well.
8311311	8315032	Yeah, because some of that stuff goes on sale like dirt cheap sometimes.
8315572	8318353	They actually have a LucasArts pack.
8318453	8319654	Something's missing from it.
8319974	8324936	Oh yeah, Maniac Mansion because that was the Maniac Mansion sequel was the game of the week last week.
8325596	8332021	and because we let Alan pick when you were out and he picked the Day of the Tentacle and that was one of the LucasArts games that's missing from that pack.
8332581	8336344	But you can get, I think it has like Loom and some of the other things that DarkSakura has picked in the past.
8336404	8338066	That's one of the big things on there.
8338126	8339627	So, yeah, pretty cool.
8341088	8341348	All right.
8342486	8344628	Oh yes, next email.
8345929	8347631	The subject is Garrus.
8348271	8349252	And it starts off, Garrus.
8349732	8350793	Hello sentient creatures.
8351434	8353536	There is a media event that I'm sure you are aware of.
8353596	8358920	This is something that people have been eagerly anticipating and have been looking forward to for a while.
8359021	8361503	I'm also sure that many of us out there saw this media event.
8362003	8368791	However, there are some of us who haven't seen the media event or have yet to see this media event in its entirety.
8369372	8371094	It is for this reason that I email you today.
8371575	8374879	Please, for the sake of all of us who haven't seen it, please don't spoil the British Open.
8375680	8377402	Stay black, Redertainment, Garris.
8377722	8378163	DarkNightRises.com
8395310	8396671	I have one question from that movie.
8396771	8396991	What?
8397371	8399172	Why did Bane sound Belgian?
8400272	8402013	Is it just me or did he sound Belgian?
8402313	8405754	I do not think you should talk about his voice in a negative manner.
8405894	8407935	He sounded like Count Von Count to me.
8408195	8408736	He sounded Belgian.
8412800	8417726	I liked his voice, even if it was a little silly.
8418006	8419528	He sounded very pleasant.
8419608	8421711	I'm glad they changed it from that trailer, though.
8422772	8424654	Like in the trailer, Bane sounded like this.
8425315	8426196	Okay, Tom Hardy.
8430720	8435863	Tom Hardy is... I'm just saying this as your resident gay gamer.
8436023	8436944	I'm just putting this out there.
8436984	8439286	Tom Hardy is so fucking hot.
8439386	8440406	Like I can't even.
8440686	8441387	I can't even.
8443533	8445194	There's no Bruce Campbell, I'm sorry.
8445335	8446476	He wasn't that hot as Bane.
8448317	8449698	Oh, the movie, the movie, can I just say?
8450679	8452300	It wasn't as good as the last one.
8452360	8453121	I didn't see the last one.
8453201	8457525	The Dark Knight will probably be like the best comic book movie they ever freaking make.
8457785	8458145	Avengers.
8458506	8461408	But I honestly think Dark Knight was better than Avengers.
8461428	8463910	Don't get me wrong, I love the Avengers, but Dark Knight was off-managing.
8463930	8464591	DC fails.
8465832	8468574	This new movie was pretty good, except the...
8470095	8495816	I liked Catwoman there was a twist and I was pleasantly surprised with Catwoman Anne Hathaway is a goddess let's just be real Anne Hathaway deserves to have statues built of her the ending twist I should have seen coming because I saw the casting but it still threw me even though I knew there's a couple twists and one of them I saw within like five seconds of the character showing up I'm like oh not that that's the one I probably should have seen coming because I knew better anyway
8498084	8499625	I don't want to spoil anything.
8522780	8546279	although after playing for about six hours in between two days I found myself wishing there were more wow-ish things about it oh well I guess all other MMOs were the gateway drug to the ultra drug wow as we know it as a sucker that is on the annual pass plan I guess I'll go roll a new tune and start my adventure all over again just so I don't feel like I'm giving charity money to Blizzard
8547779	8550960	Just really hoping something fresh comes from Guild Wars 2.
8551720	8557861	Not being a hater or a troll, but it would be exciting to see a new MMO come out and be the prolific WoW killer.
8557981	8558481	Your thoughts?
8558741	8560341	And this is from Travis.
8561701	8567662	I'm going to use this opportunity to give a cheap plug to the best little Horde house in Azeroth, www.hordehouse.com.
8567702	8572763	It's the other show that I'm on on VOG Network that debuts Wednesdays here at VOG.
8574564	8576584	I will say this about World of Warcraft.
8577624	8579186	And I've said this many times on Horde House.
8579367	8584893	The game that will kill World of Warcraft is World of Warcraft.
8585454	8585954	That's right.
8586395	8589539	That's going to be the thing that kills World of Warcraft is itself.
8589699	8591801	Because this is the type of thing that inevitably happens.
8592222	8593423	What's killing Diablo 3?
8594785	8595366	Question mark.
8596201	8596641	Itself.
8597702	8602105	So I think the only thing that's going to really kill World of Warcraft is itself.
8602605	8603786	Not that that's never going to happen.
8604166	8606248	I mean, the steam's going to run out someday.
8606928	8623139	And I guess maybe I should say instead of itself, I should say Blizzard, because whatever Blizzard's next MMO ends up being will probably be, I mean, as long as they don't make some of the mistakes they made with Diablo 3, which I think is inevitably going to push back Titan or whatever this new MMO ends up being.
8625140	8652099	I think it could have a large impact on WoW's user base but I think World of Warcraft is going to be around for a long time to come because so many people have invested so much into it it's just the way it is anyhow that was it well then you should send more emails for next week mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com I want to hear from some of you playstation home folks give us some playstation related questions and so forth
8653866	8656788	Or here's a serious question for the home people.
8657428	8659309	Do you think that PlayStation Home gets a bad rap?
8659729	8665032	Because there's a lot of people that don't take home very seriously or don't get home.
8665072	8669314	And I'm going to openly admit, we've been kind of those types of skeptics on the show in the past.
8669394	8673456	Because, you know, home was kind of plugged as this big...
8674036	8676797	Do you think your place has gotten a bad rap?
8695464	8715306	I will say this the community of course is wonderful and events and things like this and I think home is a lot better now than it was three years ago and there is a lot to unlock in there and fun stuff but you know kind of want to throw that out there I want to hear from some of you at our mailbag mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com
8717020	8717340	All right.
8718722	8726048	And BlackWolf is reporting from live within PlayStation Home that the PlayStation Home folks agree that Avengers was better than Dark Knight.
8727790	8728210	Thank you.
8728330	8729151	I love you all.
8729291	8730472	I love you all, my children.
8731673	8733034	Because I mean fucking Hawkeye.
8733174	8734035	Sorry, Hawkeye.
8735536	8743043	Or as I've heard one smaller child say, not Becky's son, but like a seven-year-old, Hawk Guy.
8743063	8744004	Okay.
8746983	8747364	Alright.
8748685	8749305	Moving on.
8749425	8754310	It's time for us to get angsty in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
8754730	8756812	Why do we have a segment called the FUs of the Week?
8757132	8758093	Because we can, FU!
8777902	8793674	While driving to San Francisco yesterday, I was on this little bit where the carpool lane splits off to sort of bypass the rest of traffic to get to the... just past Emeryville to get to where you pay the tolls.
8794815	8797797	And some 60-year-old Asian man...
8799198	8803520	And now I normally do not support stereotypes, but sometimes they exist for a reason.
8805861	8812023	There has to be something that enabled the stereotype to exist, why it's usually accepted.
8812283	8813543	Well, definitely driving while Asian.
8815124	8816905	In his little Mazda MPV.
8818385	8836833	Decides that he's going to change lanes Right where I am And as Marissa is my witness Because she was sitting there in the back I beat Luckily she had some airbags to protect her I beeped my horn I flicked my lights
8838880	8841302	and definitely screamed, what the fuck are you doing?
8842242	8843443	Several times in the car.
8844344	8845765	And Becky was in the front seat.
8845825	8847466	She was a mess after.
8848726	8850047	He ran right into where she was.
8850227	8851848	Luckily, he wasn't going very quickly.
8851868	8852949	We were going at speed.
8853129	8857032	I was going 65 because of the way traffic was moving.
8857072	8858173	And some other guy was on my ass.
8858813	8859894	So I couldn't slow down.
8859914	8861715	There is no right to merge.
8862275	8866158	And on top of that, he was trying to cross and right where the line was starting to go solid.
8866898	8872842	Moving that fast, having a collision that fast, you guys are very, I mean, no matter what, it's lucky.
8872942	8874283	I would have been like Becky.
8874303	8875363	I would have been hysteric.
8876584	8877124	That would have been me.
8877144	8878085	She was just tensed up.
8878245	8879706	Oh, no, I would have been full on tears.
8880046	8881687	Well, here's what happened.
8882528	8886910	Me, when I panic, I either cry or scream, and I opted for screaming.
8887851	8888672	You're very good at it.
8889472	8889712	Hush.
8890233	8891173	So here's what happened.
8891233	8891894	He basically...
8893414	8900844	Thankfully, I guess he got defensive enough or something, and I honestly think that he started to pull over when I was in his blind spot.
8901425	8908093	He knocked my passenger side rearview mirror off, which I'm very pissed off about, because you know I love my car.
8908674	8911518	I love the Ponte Yoda, the rally vibe, whatever we call it.
8912652	8914133	and scraped up the side of my car.
8914173	8915593	I mean, it's not bad damage.
8915653	8917654	The car drove perfectly fine after that.
8918375	8922756	But, um... So we stopped in the little divider, like, right where the lane split.
8923116	8925397	So it was... We had room to move around there.
8926478	8930019	And... He comes out of his car yelling at me.
8930720	8932620	So I'm like, What the fuck, dude?
8932660	8933741	You broke my car!
8933821	8934941	You still have a mirror!
8936042	8938023	And just... I was like...
8939123	8968352	and he was like yelling stuff like please speak with some intelligence I can't understand you and his wife was definitely a lot more reasonable than he was and we got it worked out and it's funny we're both through AAA for our insurance so I just had to say oh he's with AAA here's his number because I'm with AAA so I was like oh we've got his record right now I've got photos because I am like that and take photos you've got the digital camera in your glove box I'm sure well on my phone I guess that's true we all do now
8969247	8971127	And now here's what the stupid thing was.
8971247	8982790	In his little Mazda MPV, he had mattresses stacked right behind their heads to block his rearview mirror, including blocking his blind spot.
8982870	8983650	Uh-oh.
8984010	8984430	Exactly.
8984490	8987251	Which is not illegal, but definitely not safe.
8987571	8988951	And not good for his insurance.
8989371	8989551	No.
8990312	8991212	And I have photos of it.
8991972	8992312	Yikes.
8992352	8994953	Because I'm kind of an anal bitch that way.
8995973	8996793	So, um...
8999194	9002936	The other parts of my FU now go to the California Highway Patrol.
9003036	9005557	Now, the guy didn't take a report because nobody was injured.
9006778	9008499	The cars were relatively fine.
9008539	9017223	It wasn't... Well, they can, but at this point, I was just like, fuck it, dude.
9017324	9018304	I'm hungry, and I'm...
9022306	9028951	You know how I get when I get on that verge of anxiety where I'm just kind of shaky and don't want to deal with shit?
9029171	9029731	That was me.
9030492	9034934	So I stopped and did some deep breathing.
9035555	9042199	But this is funny because we kept seeing people pull over the whole fucking way from Sacramento to San Francisco and back.
9042899	9044160	The highway patrol is everywhere.
9044240	9046782	We wait like 20 minutes for them to show up.
9047500	9048442	Well, it's like...
9057674	9061415	And I have to say that my defensive driving is pretty good.
9062476	9066617	Except the thing is that I couldn't swerve to the side because there was a wall next to me.
9067198	9071499	And it would have been worse to run into the wall than have the dude run into me.
9071699	9074020	And I tried to speed up to get around him.
9074420	9079022	Which is, I honestly think that me speeding up was why the collision wasn't worse.
9079702	9083644	And his mirror was just like tipped up just a little bit.
9083664	9084704	Just tipped up a little bit.
9084944	9085585	Mine was gone.
9086485	9088106	Mine is somewhere in Emeryville right now.
9089367	9090167	So, fuck him.
9092008	9093589	Now, this is the other part of the fuck you.
9093970	9097352	Fuck everybody on the road who was beeping at us and going, nice job.
9099493	9101034	Didn't help when I got out of the car either.
9102779	9104300	Keep it classy, California.
9104520	9111424	Well, one of the guys managed to stop, like, slow down just enough for me to go, You get out here and fix it then!
9113425	9114886	And he rolled up his window.
9117127	9117567	Bastard.
9118207	9120088	I love it when your anger isn't directed at me.
9120549	9120869	Alright.
9121689	9122390	Well, it's just...
9124609	9131414	I don't, you know, I don't get... And you know, the lady at Allstate, she was like, Oh, it's always the people who are at fault that do the yelling.
9131534	9131875	You mean AAA?
9131915	9132155	AAA.
9132295	9141482	Yeah, I called Allstate first because I was so... Well, when I got home, I was still... Every time I looked in my rearview mirror and didn't see it not there, I'd just get pissed again.
9142042	9144164	So when I get home, I'm so pissed off and shaky.
9144184	9145064	And you can ask Marissa.
9145705	9146745	I was pissed off and shaking.
9147806	9149746	I went to Allstate instead of AAA.
9150527	9151047	Oops.
9151587	9156048	So I'm on the phone with freaking Allstate and they're trying to find information for me.
9156068	9157108	Like, wait, I'm with AAA.
9157308	9157628	Hang up.
9158868	9164189	Well, Misty in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, if I find it when I pass through Emeryville next time, I'll get it back for you.
9166930	9170090	I will share a picture from my Facebook with everyone.
9170470	9171011	All right, Loki.
9171031	9172811	I don't know how you're going to follow that, but good luck.
9172951	9173091	F you.
9174206	9179655	Uh, FU2, people that change up tournament rules 15 minutes before the tournament starts.
9180316	9181939	Come on, that's a little ridiculous.
9182139	9183041	Thankfully, I'm patient.
9183081	9183822	If my wife had it...
9185717	9187818	I'd be trying to get my money back.
9188018	9189619	I'd be trying to get money for the gas.
9189739	9195281	I'd be trying to deface their website and smear them all over the other side.
9195782	9198763	I just don't want to put that much effort.
9198883	9200784	Thank God Nelly wasn't in Jamie's car.
9201304	9202985	You should break off his rearview mirror.
9203225	9208847	To kind of go a little bit with what Jamie said, people that change lanes without signaling, and there's a lot of them, and
9209287	9210628	This guy didn't signal either.
9210909	9214832	I had, you know, it's like, dude, you're like, and they were elderly people.
9215893	9217154	But it's not just elderly people.
9218956	9220617	In my case, it's elderly Asians.
9221538	9228224	But seriously, I mean, and the people that are older, not necessarily elderly, but like at least in their 50s.
9228704	9230606	Dude, how long have you been fucking driving?
9230966	9231206	Really?
9231306	9233168	Is a turn signal like a new thing to you?
9233188	9233708	You just now...
9234369	9234689	DarkSakura.com
9264434	9265295	Well, I'll go next.
9265895	9266276	I don't know.
9266356	9268478	I don't really have any traffic FUs this week.
9268578	9270800	Sorry to break form here, but I will say this.
9271601	9281310	FU to the fact that I kind of hurt my knee pretty bad last week because in my role that I was playing in Repo the Genetic Opera, I got to die three times as three different cops.
9281850	9287375	So one of the times I died, I hit the ground pretty hard and I kind of fucked up my knee doing that.
9287956	9290178	Maybe I should actually wear the knee pads next time, but
9290678	9294863	I didn't have time when I changed my costume to get them on because they can kind of be a pain in the ass.
9295043	9296745	So F you to the fact that I fucked up my knee.
9297806	9298667	Oops, not that music.
9298707	9299087	This music.
9299127	9299868	Yeah, one other thing.
9300609	9303752	F you to the hills in San Francisco and having to walk uphill both ways.
9304353	9304794	Just saying.
9304814	9305314	Through the snow.
9305334	9307376	Walking from Japantown to the Castro.
9307396	9308357	Ow.
9309078	9309378	I'm back.
9309659	9311421	Marissa, if you have any F yous.
9313680	9323051	This is going to absolutely shock anyone that loves me and knows me well, but I don't have that much to bitch about right now.
9323111	9330199	I know, it's... Those of you out there in Radio Land that know me are going to be like... But, yeah, F you to that guy on the road.
9330260	9330460	I mean...
9331651	9332152	I'm from L.A.
9332172	9337174	where, you know... You can't fucking complain about anything traffic.
9337775	9338975	People are crazy in L.A.
9338995	9342937	We're just constantly in the upright position on the road out there.
9344858	9345159	Nice.
9345199	9346479	Oh, yeah, well, I guess I could say F.U.
9346499	9350822	to the gentleman I mentioned earlier.
9351162	9353923	But I don't want to... Never mind, because that involves F.U.
9354303	9357625	So... But, yeah, so... F.U.
9357785	9358986	to bad drivers, like everybody else.
9361064	9361764	Well played.
9390540	9414491	that's that's that's that's ballsy that's safe all right two more stories for you guys then we're going to get to the skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR but not just yet because we have a few more stories starting with Loki yes um so one of the games that's being kickstarted right now is actually another Shadowrun game Shadowrun Online and they talked a little bit more details about their game and showed a little bit of gameplay which looks pretty awesome it kind of it's like a
9415151	9417013	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9438753	9465931	and also they're showing some of the different things in there they have a portion of the game where okay you go to these hub worlds and you get your mission and there's a part of the mission that requires you to do the investigation work and the leg work and so if your leg work isn't very good you may not know that hey there's an easier way to get into this you know location in order to get this information or hey this is going to be heavily guarded by something so you'll kind of you know
9467072	9468133	know a little bit about it.
9470275	9470855	But that's kind of cool.
9471115	9474618	And then, of course, they're saying that the game at launch is going to retail for $39.99.
9475459	9481544	Of course, if you back the Kickstarter, you'll get the game at $25 at that donation level.
9482524	9488909	I guess a new campaign, they're going to be launching every three to four months for $15.
9488949	9492672	So it'll be kind of add-on expansions.
9494213	9495975	Sound like something you might be putting money down for?
9496974	9515622	Maybe, I mean, I've already backed one Kickstarter Shadowrun game, so I'd be kind of curious, but once again, I don't have time for MMOs, but the game sounds like it's more single player with other people at the same time, kind of, I don't know.
9516969	9521173	You can play it single player, you can play it co-op, or you can do PvP.
9523195	9524076	It'll be neat.
9524096	9525198	I'll have to see when it comes out.
9525278	9527680	I'm probably not going to back it, though.
9527740	9530043	Just because I've backed too much stuff recently.
9531365	9531926	Insert Coin Clothing
9550328	9552830	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9575447	9581449	So, yeah, if you want some Sega clothes, sounds like something of DarkSakura's alley, although it would cost an arm and a leg to import.
9582229	9585090	Maybe you can get a friend in the UK to help you shop at InsertCoinClothing.
9585110	9586351	Dear Mr. Kidman.
9588551	9593013	All right, InsertCoinClothing.com if you want more information on that, some of the official Sega clothing.
9593033	9594253	You know what I fucking want?
9594413	9597774	Excuse me, Sega, I don't know if it's official, but Sega-inspired clothing.
9597794	9599075	I just want the N7 hoodie.
9599275	9600795	That's all I want is the N7 hoodie.
9600875	9601655	Somebody get it for me.
9605137	9608738	Okay, I'm getting a message via BlackWolf from PlayStation Home.
9609418	9610998	Blender wants to do another contest.
9611499	9617740	Pick an animal and the first person to type that animal into the home space wins another prize in home.
9617920	9618921	So an animal.
9619461	9620861	What animal are we going to pick?
9621161	9622202	Should we go obvious?
9623742	9625563	DarkSakura, why don't you pick for us?
9626163	9628684	What animal do you think they should type in the home chat?
9630664	9631625	I can't tell them that though.
9631645	9632505	They have to guess, right?
9633394	9662531	um picking it wait wait are we so you're gonna have to clarify do we say it do we say it aloud or are they supposed to guess what did it okay yeah Black Wolf says yes say it lemur a lemur all right there you go I didn't say ferret so all you people who are trying to get the jump no all right a lemur all right good luck all right love it
9665991	9667071	Let us know who wins, Bobby.
9682702	9688946	Alright, and remember... Marissa goes, animal in the sack!
9691128	9696551	This is all I hear from people that play Mass Effect, so... Remember... No, it's Caden for me.
9697532	9699793	If you talk to the gays, they'll all say, Caden!
9701715	9717665	and I'm like Kate is an ass who actually his model is like the guy he's modeled after and who did all the face cap and stuff actually is like a gay bartender from the Abbey and he's hot I gotta admit he was easy on the eyes
9718986	9719266	All right.
9719586	9720586	Skull King won.
9720626	9721587	Of course he did.
9721807	9722707	Of course he won.
9723547	9723827	All right.
9723847	9724527	But you know what?
9724547	9731269	He deserves it for helping support the VOG participation with Summerfest.
9731289	9734270	Lemurs, lemurs, cutie furry lemurs.
9734530	9734810	All right.
9735270	9737871	Let's move on to the Skyplane.
9737891	9739391	We've got to open that up.
9739411	9740051	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9740091	9744452	The Skyplane is open right now for you guys to give us a call.
9745273	9746853	And if you want to call us from PlayStation Home...
9747273	9747573	Awesome.
9747734	9750756	If you're one of our regular listeners who wants to call us, that's awesome too.
9751356	9754359	We will talk to you at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9755140	9757161	Meanwhile, let me get to some Twitter topics.
9757361	9759483	We have a few things that were sent to us via Twitter.
9759983	9764687	And I want to look at this from Tigerclaw because this tweet here from Tigerclaw just jumps out at me.
9764707	9765728	It's like, what?
9766929	9772874	Irrational Games Job lists 85 plus Metacritic score as a requirement.
9774363	9777265	This is the developer of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite.
9777325	9778346	It's Irrational Games.
9778686	9788753	They posted a job listing for a design manager, and apparently one of their resume or whatever has to have a past work that has a high score on Metacritic.
9788773	9789013	That's...
9790074	9790894	Kind of surprising.
9790934	9793015	It's posted on the Gamasutra job boards.
9793495	9797857	Credit on at least one game with an 85-plus average Metacritic review score.
9799697	9808460	How do you feel about Metacritic's score having such weight, especially when you consider the games like Child of Eden got an 84, Mirror's Edge got an 81?
9809120	9809840	Hmm.
9810280	9814762	Remember that whole controversy over Fallout New Vegas and the bonus they didn't get because it was an 84?
9814802	9814862	Hmm.
9819304	9824827	So, what's the job requirement is that they've had to publish or worked on a game that received a Metacritic over 85?
9824887	9825647	Yeah, yeah.
9826427	9827428	You have to have some credit.
9827528	9828708	Alright, well, let's go to the phones.
9828728	9843415	What if, like, their co-worker Bob just really bombed when it came to, like, you know, it's like, yeah, we did all this really good work, but man, he just, like, he just made fart noises into a microphone for all the dialogue in the game, and it just really hurt us.
9844896	9845756	Alright, let's go to the phones.
9845796	9846697	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
9846717	9847077	Who's this?
9848218	9848898	Hey, it's Oscar.
9849318	9851000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9869907	9873649	Oh my gosh, you drove 12 hours to see the Zelda Symphony.
9874029	9876410	Well, I went to... It was well worth it.
9876570	9880991	I went to LA to see the Dear Friends concert, so yeah, it's about the same.
9881172	9881752	It was worth it?
9882472	9883392	Yeah, definitely.
9883472	9884973	Tell us a little bit about the experience.
9885993	9891316	Like, I don't know, did any of you guys buy Skyward Sword and see how they had the orchestra CD packaged in with the game?
9891536	9892436	Sadly, no.
9892556	9894397	I never got around to that one, sadly.
9895287	9904493	Alright, well, like, it has, like, seven or eight or so tracks on that CD, and it's... They played pretty much most of those, but there were so much more.
9904533	9907134	Like, they had complete, like, symphonic movements in each of the game.
9907335	9919842	Like, there was Ocarina of Time movement, a Twilight Princess movement, a movement from Link to the Past, and, oh my god, the friggin' Link to the Past one, like, I teared up at one part where they did the credits music, because I just forgot about that.
9921103	9922064	That game is so good.
9923305	9923525	Yeah.
9923545	9923625	Yeah.
9924697	9928462	Don't get me wrong, Ocarina of Time is my favorite, but that game has some moments.
9929162	9931445	I don't know.
9931665	9932687	You didn't just go by yourself.
9932727	9933828	I imagine you went with friends.
9934649	9936411	Yeah, I had a couple friends with me that went.
9937973	9941457	Actually, it was one of my friends who posted on Facebook, I'm buying tickets today.
9941497	9942117	Who wants to go?
9942398	9943899	I was one of the first people to respond.
9945185	9949108	So he bought my ticket, which was only $65 for that theater.
9949128	9951370	It was like the Wolf Trap Theater near D.C.
9953112	9954733	They were really good seats, actually.
9955574	9956334	They were pretty close.
9957015	9958296	So you drove from where?
9958817	9959597	You live in Ohio?
9960058	9960398	Michigan?
9961078	9968505	Yeah, well, I live in Northeast Ohio, but my friend who bought the tickets lives down in Athens, Ohio, which is like the southeastern portion of it.
9969205	9969385	So...
9971264	9975926	I had to go down there anyway to move stuff out of my apartment for the next year.
9977126	9981268	So it was no big deal driving down there myself, but then he drove to D.C.
9981388	9981988	for the most part.
9982609	9984950	Wow, that's a long drive.
9985030	9986070	But that's awesome.
9986130	9988071	I mean, it sounds like it was quite the experience.
9988311	9989291	What was the crowd like?
9992533	9993793	It was a mixed bag.
9994153	10000076	I thought it was going to be a lot of kids, but actually it was only a few and a lot of teenagers to adults.
10001121	10006127	and, like, the kids that were there, like, I saw their dads that were with them all had their 3DSs out.
10006147	10007769	Like, it was just a street pass fest.
10007929	10009351	Like, just non-stop.
10009471	10011914	I probably got 100 during the course of the day.
10012115	10016900	Oh my, yeah, you probably could have beat Find Me in one sitting there.
10016920	10017541	That's awesome.
10018162	10018843	Oh, definitely.
10019223	10019464	It was...
10020956	10021336	I don't know.
10021436	10022836	You need to go.
10022896	10023497	You really should.
10023597	10025737	I do if they come back through here.
10025757	10028458	The last concert is in San Jose on December 14th.
10028538	10030018	If you can try to make that one.
10030138	10030458	Is it?
10031078	10032778	I might just do that actually.
10032838	10034559	What day of the week is December 14th?
10034599	10034859	Let's see.
10034899	10037359	The 6th is Umlaut and that's a Thursday.
10037379	10039380	That sounds like it would be a Wednesday.
10039400	10040120	No, it's a Friday.
10041640	10042360	Maybe.
10042380	10044121	That would be great.
10044141	10049102	Go to Zelda-Symphony.com and there should be a link to the schedule up there and you can check it all out.
10049342	10050102	Anyone want to go?
10050482	10050762	Anyone?
10050922	10051222	Anyone?
10051402	10051642	Anyone?
10051823	10052103	Maybe?
10052243	10052883	All right, we'll see.
10052943	10054784	I'll find... Maybe Alan will want to go.
10055425	10056085	We'll make it a trip.
10056125	10056445	It'll be fun.
10056485	10057646	I have friends in San Jose, too.
10058186	10066271	Mel and Mel live there, and you know them from this show, and it'll be cool to go see something like that, so... Yeah, well, thanks for the tip, and I'm glad to hear you had a good time.
10067712	10069373	Yeah, I just hope that they release, like...
10070305	10084124	another orchestrated CD like maybe after the tour is done because some of those songs I just really want to hear again I'm sure there'll be another Zelda pre-order disc in the future yeah there has to be alright well Osfer I'm going to let you go to get more calls but thanks for the call okay
10086320	10087720	Alright, no problem.
10087760	10088081	Alrighty.
10088101	10092563	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10093664	10095845	Meanwhile, some other tweets.
10096005	10097085	One more from Tiger Claw.
10097286	10098506	I let people have two tweets.
10099147	10100687	Just kind of a quick headline here.
10100787	10105870	Microsoft halts further development on what was to be the free-to-play game Flight.
10106310	10110613	It was supposed to be a free-to-play entry in Microsoft's Flight Simulator franchise.
10111293	10114095	I wonder if that has to do with the Vancouver layoffs we heard about earlier.
10114115	10114715	Yeah, look at...
10115478	10118360	Well, I don't know.
10118960	10125444	I liked the flight simulator games back in the day, but I mean, they're so intricate now, like I don't actually know how to fly a plane, people.
10126224	10126845	But it looked fun.
10127525	10127945	And pretty.
10128085	10132248	I remember those used to be like the high-end graphic games or the flight simulator games.
10133008	10133408	Yes, Marissa?
10133508	10137050	Well, I mean, if you really wanted to make them properly accurate, you need to have bitchy flight attendants.
10137251	10140152	That's a real flight simulator.
10140452	10141873	I want to join the Mile High Club.
10141913	10143154	You know, bathrooms.
10143988	10145308	All right, we got another phone call.
10145348	10146289	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10146309	10146669	Who's this?
10147549	10148069	It's Shane.
10148229	10148369	Hey.
10148409	10150550	With a very bad voice right now because I'm Flemmy.
10150890	10151730	Hi, Flemmy.
10151770	10152690	Thanks for sharing.
10152790	10153370	Hi, Flemmy.
10153390	10154011	You're welcome.
10154271	10155331	So what's on your mind tonight?
10156771	10159372	The PlayStation All-Stars thingy-majigger.
10159452	10160212	That's right.
10160252	10162793	So you're about to violate every NDA in the world.
10162953	10164053	It's not my NDA.
10164253	10165393	It's my friend's NDA.
10165513	10166894	I'm violating his NDA.
10167354	10168174	Sounds very dirty.
10168214	10170835	Technically, by letting you play, he's already violated the NDA.
10170875	10171435	There you go.
10172475	10174996	And I'm not giving out his PSN.
10175036	10176556	I'm not giving out my PSN name.
10176596	10178857	So go tie it back to me, Sony.
10178917	10179137	Go.
10179637	10182318	Well, I wouldn't throw down a challenge like that, actually.
10182538	10184059	That was a joke.
10184259	10185279	Sony, please don't.
10185739	10187600	You have allegedly played the beta.
10188920	10189361	Yes, allegedly.
10189381	10193785	So why don't you give us allegedly your thoughts?
10194405	10201932	So right now, the beta that I allegedly played very much feels like a lifeless Smash Bros.
10201972	10210680	clone, which, you know, not terrible, I guess, but it's not really fun yet, which I think games are supposed to be fun, last I heard.
10210780	10211641	Why wasn't it fun?
10212942	10213022	Um...
10214235	10214976	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10235572	10238514	You were telling me that the beta is only multiplayer, correct?
10238554	10240596	Yeah, I have to connect to somebody else.
10240656	10242237	I can't play against computer players.
10242617	10250443	Now, I have not tried to see if I could play two people on the same console, but part of the problem in the beta right now is when you play Smash Bros.
10250504	10257689	and you get every person in a tight area, the camera zooms in, it doesn't do that well in this game.
10257789	10265235	So it doesn't matter how close you are to the action, your character is still really far away and it can make it very hard to figure out what's going on at any given time.
10265495	10270277	Do you think that might have hurt your impressions a little bit, though, the fact you couldn't fuck around in single player at all?
10272598	10280001	No, because ideally that style of game is just really multiplayer-based, I feel like.
10280041	10280561	Smash Bros.
10280601	10282582	isn't fun by yourself at all.
10282802	10290831	Let's be real though, being able to play online multiplayer is a feature that Smash Bros., I guess the one on the Wii had it, but it didn't do it very well.
10291011	10291912	It didn't really do it very well.
10292553	10293815	But to Smash Bros.
10293875	10296498	credit, and I'm not like you, I like the Smash Bros.
10296538	10297278	games a lot.
10297659	10300382	I don't think they're bad games, I just think they're overrated.
10300642	10301043	Let's say that.
10301603	10303766	Here's the thing, what I always loved about Smash Bros.
10303806	10306510	is that they're very robust packages.
10306970	10311376	Like, there is so much, especially those most recent Smash Bros.
10311396	10317044	games, so many unlocks, so many other modes, so many mini-games and other things to experience.
10317664	10337948	and a lot of that was brought into Kid Icarus too so I think the projects that that team does tend to be very robust experiences and I think if Sony doesn't offer fans that same really rich experience which you're not going to see in such a limited beta I think you are going to feel shortchanged a little bit.
10338598	10368230	well and then one of the things I feel like they really get right are the stages I really like the fact that they change and kind of mix up different games in one stage like I was playing a god of no I was playing the Ratchet and Clank stage and all of a sudden it turned into God of War which is really cool and then one turned into like Patapon I don't remember which stage it also was but I really enjoyed that feature I just after now I didn't know about that leaked list of characters
10368850	10370851	that people had data mined from the beta.
10371372	10376875	I'm kind of sad that there aren't those real robust options that Smash Bros.
10376995	10377295	offers.
10377656	10383779	But I will probably get it because I love that Dante and I will play as him even if he's a terrible character.
10384360	10388622	So despite everything you just said about not feeling super great about it, you're going to buy it anyway.
10389203	10391964	Because they're adding that Dante that's really, really hot.
10392104	10394466	It was good enough to make you want to buy it in the end.
10395276	10395536	Yes.
10395736	10396997	Well, I think it has potential.
10397057	10406882	And I think, you know, I'm not judging really purchasing it based on the beta because you can tell that the beta, whatever build they're using, is really early on.
10406902	10407122	Allegedly.
10407142	10410764	There's a lot of, like, barren features in it.
10410864	10411145	So...
10412105	10412465	I don't know.
10412845	10417648	I'm not going to hate the game yet, but it still needs to do more to wow me.
10418008	10420150	I think they can pull it off, though.
10420750	10422231	Well, we'll see what happens in the coming months.
10422271	10427274	Hopefully there's a lot of good stuff to be unlocked and things we haven't seen yet and some of these characters in the leak.
10427854	10439521	Sound Potential, which, by the way, I think Shane coming on here and giving his alleged thoughts on a beta he may have allegedly played is a whole lot less of an infraction than whoever hacked the damn files to pull out those unlockable characters.
10439541	10441782	Yeah, and they had pictures of the stages too.
10441802	10443383	I kind of thought those stages were neat.
10444264	10447927	As a legal secretary, I approve of your legalese ass covering.
10449289	10450831	Thank you, I appreciate that.
10451692	10454975	I think we need to hire Marissa as a consultant for other shows in the future.
10455476	10456016	That'd be amazing.
10456036	10457558	Oh, and Frapp is awesome in it.
10457598	10459960	Like, he's really cool.
10459980	10460861	Do you get to actually rap?
10462060	10462882	No, but okay.
10463423	10466608	Remember that stupid boombox from the game?
10466949	10467129	Yes.
10467730	10469313	Okay, you get to throw him around.
10469633	10471677	And I like that because I hate that boombox.
10472098	10474442	Is there a stage that's you waiting to use the toilet?
10476073	10477494	Not in the beta, at least.
10498829	10502051	They should do another Umjam or Lammy because that game was amazing.
10502091	10502771	Alright, I'll take that.
10503091	10504672	Umjam or Lammy is pretty fucking good.
10505072	10506693	I'm sad that she's not a leaked character.
10506733	10508033	That would be really cool.
10508473	10511175	There's always DLC.
10511695	10513636	I will buy Umjam or Lammy DLC.
10514036	10520879	If I could get the one stage that everybody except for me hates as a stage you can play in the game, I would be so excited.
10521499	10522880	Which is the hell stage.
10523180	10528561	Shane, before I let you go, we have a question for you from PlayStation Home Summerfest coming in.
10529202	10532963	Blackwolf in PlayStation Home says, where is your Rhythm Thief review?
10535763	10536464	In written form.
10536624	10537284	No, no, no, no, no, no.
10537344	10538064	Don't spoil it here.
10538104	10539004	I want it in written form.
10539204	10539724	So does Bobby.
10539744	10540685	No, no, no, no.
10540705	10542305	I'm not going to spoil my review.
10542745	10543445	Here's the thing.
10543846	10545266	My 3DS is busted.
10545746	10547508	So, yeah.
10547788	10548449	What'd you do to it?
10548489	10553135	For some reason, when I hit the B button, it turns off, which is usually the function of the off button.
10555037	10556739	You don't say.
10557379	10560223	I can hear Alan laughing at what you just said all the way from the kitchen.
10562401	10562681	Hello?
10562701	10563121	Why?
10563481	10565542	Because the B button is... Never mind.
10565642	10566002	Forget it.
10566582	10568703	It sounds like you've got a short, is what it sounds like.
10568763	10569263	Yeah, it does.
10569844	10571544	Sometimes when I hold it funny, it turns off.
10571564	10572244	I'm like, whatever.
10572284	10573405	I just don't even want to play you.
10573645	10575565	There's something inside there.
10576326	10579427	Yeah, and I couldn't find a screwdriver to open it up because I would open it up and try to pick it up.
10579447	10581047	Wait, yes, you did spill something on your 3DS?
10581287	10581667	No, no, no.
10581687	10582308	I didn't spill anything.
10582328	10582788	No, no.
10583488	10587189	I will probably be getting an XL in two weeks thanks to my job so I'll start playing it again
10598813	10614741	Which we can't talk about any further on the show, but I will talk to the other hosts about it off air It's like the 3DS, but bigger Alright, moving on, I guess that's it So when you get your 3DS situation figured out, we want the review Now that it's not timely
10617922	10618662	Not my fault.
10618882	10620102	I can't even play Pokemon.
10620122	10622543	Do you know what a pain that is to me?
10622623	10624663	We really need more written content at VOG.
10624703	10626504	And granted, I'm responsible for this too.
10626644	10629604	But I mean, I've just had so much going on this week.
10630065	10634845	But yeah, if you have some time and you're interested in writing for VOG, and it doesn't have to be about video games.
10634906	10637526	It could be anything, geeky, movies, books.
10637666	10642047	I would love somebody who reads a lot of books and even comic books and manga.
10642687	10644049	I bought a book, Rob.
10644509	10647472	I bought one of the Vampire Hunter D novels that I hadn't read yet.
10647512	10648753	Does it have to be geeky books?
10648793	10650134	Because my wife reads a lot of books.
10651495	10652897	She does read a lot of geeky books.
10653157	10655739	She reads a lot of... You know what?
10655939	10657561	Your wife is hilarious, so yes.
10658001	10658782	I don't care what it is.
10658922	10659663	She should do book reviews.
10659783	10659903	I'll...
10660263	10660623	I'll ask.
10661064	10662224	I should say this, funny enough.
10662545	10667948	Speaking of book reviews, I actually am doing one for a friend site of VOG's.
10667988	10669209	I'm just not done with the book yet.
10669649	10671771	But it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out who.
10672151	10673652	But I'm hoping to have that done within the next week.
10673692	10675193	This is Fifty Shades of Grey.
10675733	10677574	It is not Fifty Shades of Grey.
10678495	10679576	Then you need to redo your review.
10679596	10681277	We're like Fifty Shades of Shit.
10681597	10683438	Fifty Shades of I'm Hanging Up on You.
10683478	10683738	Bye.
10684339	10684859	Bye.
10685299	10685600	Alright.
10688671	10688971	Lordy.
10688991	10689892	How about one more call?
10690272	10691913	I don't think he mentioned Mass Effect at all.
10693515	10693935	He didn't.
10695116	10695836	That's awesome.
10696857	10697657	Gotcha, Shane.
10699218	10700239	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10700259	10700639	Who's this?
10702420	10703181	This is Azoramay.
10703881	10704562	Say that one more time.
10705683	10706303	Azoramay.
10706643	10707304	Azoramay.
10707344	10708164	What's on your mind tonight?
10709825	10714489	I just wanted to... I just noticed that there's going to be a Final Fantasy XI revival of music...
10718427	10721257	Concerts going on in your area, and I want to be aware of that.
10721588	10749138	I am very aware of that and I kind of sort of want to go actually it's just about you know if I can convince somebody else to go with me so I don't have to go by myself but yeah it's in Berkeley they're doing like a Final Fantasy 11 you know what's funny when I signed back up for the game about a month ago like I got those emails right away and then that's the log on message I don't know if everybody sees that or I just see it because I'm in the area but when I log into the game it says don't forget we have tickets on sale now for the Final Fantasy 11 event in Berkeley so
10750479	10756145	That is so funny, because I'm a fan of it, but I haven't really lied on it for a while.
10756325	10771100	I mean, I got a letter via email about it, and I was really thinking about going, but I'm on the East Coast in New York, and I actually went to go see the Distant Worlds at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and it was really great.
10771761	10777645	But like I said, you have the same problem as you do, trying to convince friends to actually go ahead and see it.
10777745	10780628	It's like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
10781755	10786019	You know, like, would you think they're going to bring it out here at all?
10786099	10788501	It really depends on this first one and if it does well.
10788541	10789442	That's kind of the deal.
10789502	10791383	If it makes money, it'll tour.
10791443	10793185	Here's something else to consider.
10794906	10799810	We're going back years and years, so you can't really judge what's going on at Square now to these standards.
10800271	10803173	But when that first Dear Friends concert happened, which was what?
10803193	10804414	That was the first year I went to E3.
10804434	10805776	That was what, 2004, I think?
10805796	10805956	2004 or 2005?
10806036	10806296	It was 2004.
10807657	10808498	Yeah, I think it was 04
10831033	10837359	However, the next year they did a new show called More Friends that was at the Gibson Amphitheater, I think at Universal Studios.
10837980	10840863	And I went to that as well because I loved the first one so much.
10840923	10843045	And More Friends wasn't good.
10843941	10848206	I don't want to fault the musicians.
10848326	10849768	I don't want to fault the guest stars.
10849848	10851690	I don't want to fault the talent behind it.
10852051	10855535	But just the production of it was really not good.
10855635	10860020	And a lot of that was acoustic problems and a lot of the sound problems.
10860040	10861261	And there was a lot of live issues.
10861581	10862302	And I heard...
10863103	10863303	Oh, really?
10863323	10863824	Wow, I didn't know that.
10876627	10878428	So it was like a once in a lifetime.
10878468	10883731	It was like a once in like a... Yes, I can say it was a once in a lifetime event that I got to go to.
10883771	10886373	And I do consider myself lucky even though it was a bad show.
10886773	10889415	They actually had like the... And I forget her name.
10889455	10890035	Maybe you know it.
10890315	10896279	The lady from Final Fantasy X who sang that... I can't remember the name of the song.
10896299	10896599	I'm sorry.
10896639	10897679	I can't say it.
10897779	10898060	Thank you.
10899360	10926567	yeah, she was there singing it and so to hear that live was really amazing but that's, you know and so I'm thankful for moments like that but I realize, you know overall, unfortunately, the show was not a success oh, okay well, I mean, that's kind of like all I really had to really ask hey, no, it's a great question I'm tempted I will say I'm very, very tempted we'll see, I'll let you know what I end up deciding
10927529	10928129	All right, thank you.
10928389	10929030	All right, take care.
10929070	10930090	Take care.
10930590	10930930	Bye, guy.
10931811	10933291	All right, thank you so much for the call tonight.
10933311	10939774	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you have a comment you want us to read on a future show.
10939814	10947717	You know, when he phrases it that way, he says it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I do have to realize it might not be totally my backyard.
10948337	10950939	But Extifer lives in Oakland, Berkeley now.
10950979	10954321	I could totally go stay with him for a night and go to the concert.
10954801	10955942	So maybe I should.
10956623	10957783	I might not get the chance again.
10957803	10962266	And for somebody that wasn't a Final Fantasy XI for so many years, you give me a lot to think about.
10963587	10967070	A phone call to Orange Launch Radio might just set me back about 50 bucks for a ticket.
10967631	10968091	We'll see.
10968151	10968572	We'll see.
10969273	10969553	All right.
10970414	10971635	That's it for phone calls tonight.
10971715	10973597	Again, if you didn't get through, please, please tweet us.
10973617	10975538	Twitter.com slash OLR or email us.
10975599	10981424	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com It does mean we are getting very close to the end of the show.
10982045	10985668	We're getting close to the end of the party at Summerfest and PlayStation Home.
10985748	10986589	Last call.
10987209	10988210	Last call, everybody.
10989231	10993436	Before we close out tonight, I'm gonna ask Loki if he has any last minute stories.
10993717	10993917	Nope.
10994437	10994878	Wow.
10995979	10997501	I didn't even look.
10997661	10998422	Shame on you.
10999063	11003247	I couldn't think of anything that we didn't cover that was really, really big.
11003848	11005169	Actdeft tweeted the show and said, Quite fun.
11005209	11006709	And then he linked his picture on the Steam community.
11019914	11046700	this is something I posted on the VOG Network forums if you're a fan of the game Beat Hazard and you have it on PC it is very easy to mod the game and it's not like you're not doing a bad thing you are editing text files the developers like put instructions on how to edit it in there you can actually add your own internet radio feeds because Beat Hazard you can play to internet radio and it's very easy to add VOG Network as a radio feed so yes you could play Beat Hazard to my voice
11048260	11055662	But it's, you know, when there is no live or taped program on the Voicing Geeks Network, there is a music feed, so it's really meant for that.
11055962	11058802	But some people are playing along to our voices, which I think is kind of funny, too.
11058942	11060223	So you can do that.
11060923	11062063	Marathon mode.
11062283	11065164	So if we, like, yell something really fast or something, it gets harder?
11065284	11065944	Yes, yes.
11066864	11068004	Anti-dysinstalitarianism!
11068024	11072005	Buh-duh-buh-duh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah-Nah
11077214	11078595	She's breaking into prayers.
11078875	11081178	I don't know what the fuck it means.
11081218	11081658	You might.
11081998	11083280	I actually do know what it means.
11083320	11085742	Marissa, swear in Jewish frantically.
11085782	11087504	There might be a boss that responds.
11087544	11088525	You always get asked in the cafe.
11093567	11094167	God, that's hot.
11094247	11094828	You know what's funny?
11094848	11095908	People think, oh, you're Jewish.
11095948	11097609	You must have grown up learning this.
11097669	11099850	No, I know because I grew up in Los Angeles.
11103511	11103892	Nice.
11105032	11105352	All right.
11106333	11109474	If you need more information on how to mod that, I posted something on our forums.
11109574	11112255	If you're not registered at vognetwork.com, why not?
11112696	11114676	Go get your loot at vognetwork.com.
11115077	11119098	Register and participate further with the show in the forums and so forth.
11119179	11122080	Misty in chat says, Sky's voice, the game goes beat hazard.
11123421	11124061	Let's hope not.
11124562	11124882	All right.
11126103	11131028	Well, with all those tweets and all those chat comments, it's time to get to the end of the show.
11131348	11134651	But we are going to go around one last time to get everybody's final thought.
11135011	11136292	Starting with Marissa tonight.
11136352	11138454	Marissa, thank you so much for being on the show tonight.
11139015	11141517	And I think it is a-okay that you don't play a whole lot of games.
11141657	11147102	You're a nerdy enough girl, and I mean that in the best possible way, to fit right in with the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11147443	11148924	Thank you for making me literally...
11149444	11151266	literally laugh my ass off tonight.
11152407	11152928	You're the best.
11153228	11154369	Marissa, do you have any final thoughts?
11154389	11156091	I didn't take it as a high-five, but actually I do.
11156111	11160735	I feel like I might need to explain myself a little bit to the audience, especially all those new listeners.
11160935	11161456	Please do.
11161836	11167061	I know some of you must be thinking, who is this large-breasted, yappy, singer-songwriter slutbag?
11167361	11167902	Ha ha ha ha!
11169406	11172027	In reality, I actually have a major confession to make.
11172828	11174909	I am a recovering comedian.
11176350	11180152	So, that explains the majority of the material tonight.
11180372	11181052	Very nice.
11182173	11183873	But otherwise, thank you so much for having me.
11183893	11184554	It's been a pleasure.
11185254	11189877	And again, any of you people out there that enjoy metal music, please check out Prylosis.
11189997	11192838	P-R-Y-L-O-S-I-S.
11192918	11193458	They're fantastic.
11193538	11194299	It's a good CD.
11194779	11195820	Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
11195840	11198821	Yeah, they're fantastic and they're funny, so they have a great YouTube channel.
11199341	11203704	And again, it was such a pleasure hanging out here and sharing such stories.
11203984	11206445	Well, go check that out, especially fans of metal, Prylosis.
11206905	11208706	We would like our guests to be able to plug stuff.
11208746	11209467	Anything else you want to plug?
11210669	11211069	Anything else?
11211229	11211509	I don't know.
11211529	11228157	If you want to see me not being a yappy slapback, if you want to see me singing, if you look at Marissa Con Gusto, which is my nickname, M-A-R-I-S-S-A-C-O-N-G-U-S-T-O on YouTube, there are some links of small clips of me doing little covers at Kulak's Woodshed.
11229017	11230138	So, thanks.
11230858	11235440	And looks like Loki just giving away little big planet carding codes right there in the chat room.
11239107	11239507	Go get them.
11239547	11241508	Sorry, I didn't think of a way to give them away earlier.
11241528	11241848	That's alright.
11242768	11244369	If you don't get one through there, go to Joystick.
11244389	11247710	They had an article a couple pages back that you can generate free codes.
11248050	11249210	Where do you think I got mine?
11250190	11250491	Nice.
11250571	11250971	Very nice.
11252151	11252991	Thanks again, Marissa.
11254112	11254892	More final thoughts.
11255352	11256272	Loki, your final thought.
11257833	11258793	Speaking of Wednesday.
11260394	11260654	Adam's
11261331	11262511	Wednesday happens to be August 1st.
11263812	11265772	August 1st happens to be when the third gate opens.
11266773	11267473	Oh, shit.
11267513	11268113	The race is on.
11268133	11269694	Do you have time off from work to do it?
11269794	11270354	I took the day off.
11270394	11271314	Well, for multiple reasons.
11271394	11281877	I took the day off to take Josh, you know, because it's his second birthday, but also because I'm going to be staying up all night long finishing whatever game they have.
11283318	11285958	Same reason I took September 25th off work.
11286999	11287499	Understandable.
11289574	11294217	I hope the game is not hard enough for me where I can't finish it in one night.
11294677	11301101	Because I'm going to be disappointed if I have to stop playing to sleep or do other things.
11305803	11306424	Who knows what it is?
11306524	11306884	No one knows.
11307104	11308665	I just hope it's not a crappy Facebook game.
11308705	11310426	Please not be a crappy Facebook game.
11311046	11315309	Because that was already a crappy Facebook game for Gate 2, and I can't take another one.
11315369	11318871	I will throw it over the table and just say, fuck it, I'm going to sleep.
11322105	11323669	Alright, let's see.
11324571	11325794	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
11327778	11329943	Fucking, fucking, fuck, River Mirror.
11331657	11339339	My final thought tonight is, first, I want to thank everybody that participated in PlayStation Home Summerfest with us here on this lovely evening.
11339399	11340199	Thank you, Blender.
11340259	11342640	Thank you, Skull King, for putting that together.
11342720	11343680	I really appreciate it.
11344341	11349302	Thank you to those that stayed up late in the Aurora 1.5 space.
11349382	11352683	Apparently, longest event ever.
11353403	11354564	and PlayStation Home.
11354904	11356966	So thank you guys for making it a success.
11356986	11359248	There's still at least 10 people in there doing the running, man.
11359588	11360129	Good times.
11360469	11361690	Thank you guys so much.
11362211	11363071	Great community.
11363272	11364072	Really appreciate it.
11364413	11366274	And a big welcome again to all the new listeners.
11366554	11367355	Dude, that's awesome.
11367475	11370258	The rumors that they're going to be bringing a Battle Royale TV show.
11370618	11371959	I don't know how I feel about that.
11372019	11373060	I read about that this week.
11373100	11374761	I'm like, what the heck?
11375182	11378304	Otherwise, my final thought, my real final thought of the night would be
11379105	11381748	Bilbo, Bilbo Baggins.
11381908	11382929	All right, forget it.
11385472	11386553	Yes, Leonard Nimoy.
11387034	11387955	He's my hero, dude.
11388456	11391279	All right, that does it for another week at Orange Lounge Radio.
11391319	11393281	Hey, if you like the show, all we ask, you know what?
11393321	11395323	We don't have advertising rampant throughout the show.
11395724	11396444	We are not...

11424602	11425002	Alright.
11425703	11427624	It's just like you just gave away three beta codes right there.
11427644	11428285	Well, better than that.
11428325	11429286	That was just crap.
11430386	11432428	I'm talking about actual things.
11432588	11433849	I have things in my bag.
11433969	11436271	I have things that I brought that I will bring more of.
11436591	11437872	And I have things I have yet to bring.
11438693	11438993	Alright.
11439834	11440634	Have a great night, everybody.
11440654	11441855	So this stuff's already been brought in?
11443216	11444417	Yes, this stuff has already been brought in.
11444557	11446719	We'll be back in a week to do it all over again.
