WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
Tonight, July 22, 2012, has a hugely anticipated title being cancelled, Microsoft secretly

00:20.720 --> 00:31.600
steps up security and Steam heads to another platform.

00:31.600 --> 00:35.700
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of Orange

00:35.700 --> 00:36.820
Lounge Radio.

00:36.820 --> 00:43.200
It is episode number 466 for this July the 22nd of 2012.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.440
We're here to talk about video games and the gamer culture, the gamer lifestyle with you

00:47.440 --> 00:53.600
guys who are participating live at the VOG Network, live.vognetwork.com to get in the

00:53.600 --> 00:55.600
chat room and chat with us.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.360
And of course, we want to acknowledge the folks listening along in the podcast form

00:59.360 --> 01:00.360
as well.

01:00.360 --> 01:04.340
I know a lot of us listen to us on their Mondays to help get through the work day or throughout

01:04.340 --> 01:05.480
the week or what have you.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.900
So thanks for tuning in and thanks for participating in the not-live format.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.840
We just are very happy to have you all here.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.880
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours with my co-host,

01:16.880 --> 01:19.120
DarkSakra, not here tonight.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.880
She is in Las Vegas.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.920
I'll come back to that in just a minute, tell you a little more about that.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.360
But joining us tonight here in studio, we do have Techmaster Loki.

01:26.360 --> 01:27.360
Hi.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.360
How are you doing, Loki?

01:28.360 --> 01:29.360
I'm doing good.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.640
You are playing a game over there that you're giggling like crazy over.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.640
What is this?

01:33.640 --> 01:34.640
I want to be the guy Gaiden.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.640
Oh dear.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.640
Oh dear.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.160
I remember I Want to Be the Guy was one of those like impossible games, right?

01:41.160 --> 01:45.960
I just like the look of it now because it's all 16-bit-ish now and it's, you got a lot

01:45.960 --> 01:46.960
of homages.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.480
Well, obviously the first one had a lot of homages to stuff, but I mean the first level

01:50.480 --> 01:54.840
is it's bionic panda, so I mean it's pretty awesome.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.080
What is the appeal of these games that are just impossible to beat?

01:58.080 --> 01:59.400
Is it the whole- It's not impossible.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.800
They're just really hard.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
Next to impossible.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
Well, here's the thing.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.920
I have a couple reasons why I'm playing.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.480
One because it's fun.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.820
Well, it's hard, but it's still fun.

02:09.820 --> 02:16.600
Two because I'm thinking one of two things is going to happen for the next gate challenge

02:16.600 --> 02:18.680
for Ready Player One stuff.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.320
It's going to either be a game that's hard like this or it's going to be a text adventure

02:22.320 --> 02:23.960
game.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.780
Be my guess.

02:25.780 --> 02:28.060
I'm not good at either one of those.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.400
It's time to go back and study up on Zork.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.240
Pretty much, yeah, because that was one of the challenges in the book was Zork.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.120
Oh, okay.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.400
Yeah.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.140
You are standing in front of a White House.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.160
There is a mailbox here.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.920
What do you do?

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
Open mailbox.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.260
Take letter.

02:46.260 --> 02:50.080
You better read up on your FAQs for the old school Zork games.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.640
All right.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.660
Well, also joining us here, since Star Soccer is not here, we like to invite other people

02:56.660 --> 03:02.000
to come on and host, and we have our old favorite standby host who doesn't have a choice because

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
he lives here.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Say hello to Allen.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Hello.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
How are you, Allen?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
I'm great.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Awesome.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.300
Thanks for coming back tonight.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.300
You're welcome.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.300
What's new with you?

03:11.300 --> 03:15.080
You're like, I asked a bunch of people, I can't get a guest host.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.720
You have to do it.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.840
And I was like, oh, so I'm like sixth choice.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.840
That's great to hear.

03:19.840 --> 03:23.880
I asked one other person and then I was too lazy to ask anyone else.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.080
So I just, you know, tap, tap, tap.

03:27.080 --> 03:32.440
And the other person I asked was Flaco Jones, who, you know, to be fair, was here that night.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.440
He's bad luck.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.440
He's me.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.440
He makes power go out.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.440
Yeah, it's true.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.440
Maybe it's best you stay away.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.440
I'm kidding.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.440
I'm kidding.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.440
I'm kidding.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.440
But he has like babies and things.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
Yeah.

03:42.440 --> 03:47.680
When you have babies and things that, you know, priorities and all this stuff.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.080
I understand.

03:49.080 --> 03:54.680
Going to our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show at live.voggenetwork.com.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.240
Act Def starts us off tonight.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.840
Allen, the host without a choice.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.760
All right.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.800
Well, Dark Sakura isn't here tonight.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.480
She's in Las Vegas and she's at a wedding.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.780
She is at the wedding of Tiara and Dan.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.560
And you may or may not recognize those names.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.560
Tiara is somebody, she's been on OLR before, but not like in a really long time, but she

04:16.560 --> 04:20.800
came up here to Sacramento because Tiara and Jamie have been friends for a very long time.

04:20.800 --> 04:28.160
But Tiara and Dan are both two of the big writers at the site Geek Life or geek-life.com.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.940
And we've done a lot of stuff with them over the years.

04:30.940 --> 04:34.640
They've been really wonderful in promoting us and we've tried to promote them where we

04:34.640 --> 04:35.960
can.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.640
They got married today, geek-life.com.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.700
A geek wedding happened today in Las Vegas.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.800
And of course, since Jamie and Tiara go way back, she flew down there for the wedding.

04:44.800 --> 04:45.800
So I think that's great.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.360
What geek theme do they have for the wedding?

04:47.360 --> 04:51.000
I know they had like a giant doctor who doctor who everything.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.720
It's like they had like a giant doctor who TARDIS cardboard thing.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.480
And the cake topper is them.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.480
Yes.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.480
Yeah.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.400
Is it might be Amy and what's his name?

05:01.400 --> 05:04.840
I think they're, yeah, it's kind of like, he's got red hair and TRS got red hair.

05:04.840 --> 05:05.840
Exactly.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.840
He's got his doctor who characters.

05:06.840 --> 05:12.400
Well, you can read more about it at geek-life.com because Tiara does a series called Bride and

05:12.400 --> 05:15.200
the Geek or is it Beauty and the Geek?

05:15.200 --> 05:17.680
Now I sound like a terrible person because I don't know the name.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.120
I think it's Beauty and the Geek, actually, but it's about them setting up and planning

05:22.120 --> 05:23.120
their wedding.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.800
And I thought it was a really cute series, even if the name escapes me right now, because

05:25.800 --> 05:27.960
I'm under pressure.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.120
But Dark Sakura will be back next week.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.520
But we can certainly understand she wanted to go to the bachelorette party, which looked

05:33.520 --> 05:35.560
like it was last night.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.040
And I think they checked into a chocolate place.

05:39.040 --> 05:43.520
So you know, with girls, if they're not going to go see the stripper thing and do that,

05:43.520 --> 05:45.680
what do girls love more than strippers?

05:45.680 --> 05:46.680
Chocolate.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.920
So it makes sense that they would go to a chocolate place of which I guess there is

05:50.920 --> 05:54.360
one in Vegas.

05:54.360 --> 05:55.360
Let's see.

05:55.360 --> 05:59.360
Immortal King in our chat room says Dark Sakura too busy dodging the bouquet.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.520
You know, Dark Sakura is married.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.040
She's talked about her husband, Dan, several times on the show.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.920
I believe that makes you ineligible to even go out to the floor when they ask where the

06:07.920 --> 06:12.760
single ladies put your hands up, you know, so Dark Sakura would not qualify to catch

06:12.760 --> 06:14.320
the bouquet.

06:14.320 --> 06:20.300
I will point out that I did catch the garter at a wedding a couple of years ago.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.300
That was when Mel and Mel got married.

06:22.300 --> 06:23.960
I caught the garter.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.120
So still waiting.

06:26.120 --> 06:31.000
That's all right, I've caught the garter before too.

06:31.000 --> 06:40.040
All right, um, let's see, uh, also in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, um, Tiger

06:40.040 --> 06:45.040
Claw says, what Sky is trying to say is tonight's show is a sausage fest, maybe, but we will

06:45.040 --> 06:48.840
open it up to callers later on and maybe some lovely ladies will call in.

06:48.840 --> 06:53.000
Cause I know we do have some gals that listen to OLR or maybe we'll get some emails or some

06:53.000 --> 06:56.320
tweets from all genders later on.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
So we'll find out.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.400
We'll probably just get Jim Sally.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.080
Jim Sally does have a baby girl.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.960
Maybe, maybe she'll get on the line and say, or something, whatever babies say.

07:06.960 --> 07:07.960
All right.

07:07.960 --> 07:08.960
Anyhow.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.400
Um, we always like to start off the show with a kickoff topic.

07:11.400 --> 07:15.640
I don't have anything too serious tonight, but I do have one thing that has been dominating

07:15.640 --> 07:24.180
the gaming world this week, especially if you're a PC gamer, steam sale.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.180
That's right.

07:25.180 --> 07:31.920
I want to talk about how has the steam sale damaged your life or your wallet steam sale

07:31.920 --> 07:32.920
going on.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.640
I believe it ends tomorrow.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.400
I don't know if that means tomorrow at 10 AM and it's done or if that means there's

07:38.400 --> 07:42.320
like one last final hurrah where everything goes on sale or something.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
I don't know.

07:43.320 --> 07:47.760
I got my meta achievement of voting on the community's choice every day, the sale.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.000
So that means today's last day.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
That's that.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.720
Well, it says prices through the 23rd so I think today's sales are going to run through

07:54.720 --> 07:59.600
like 2 PM tomorrow and then I think it's going to be over right then it's over from yesterday

07:59.600 --> 08:03.920
that expired in eight hours from when I bought them earlier.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.880
Um, so probably, yeah, through tomorrow.

08:08.880 --> 08:14.720
So I wanted to go around and see how did the steam sale wreck your wallet this week?

08:14.720 --> 08:17.600
Uh, Loki, how did the steam sale wreck your wallet?

08:17.600 --> 08:22.120
Well, before I had purchased Skyrim and Borderlands, um, actually it was pretty good this week.

08:22.120 --> 08:26.280
I almost bought, um, Earth Defense Force, Instinct Armageddon, but then I remembered

08:26.280 --> 08:32.840
how much I'd, it was a fun game, but it's not worth owning twice unlike, you know, Earth

08:32.840 --> 08:37.160
Defense Force 2017, which I owned a lot of times.

08:37.160 --> 08:46.280
Um, and then I bought Arma 2, uh, the, uh, the pack they had, it was with, uh, Arma 2

08:46.280 --> 08:49.280
and the expansion for like 20 bucks.

08:49.280 --> 08:58.920
So I got that, almost, I almost considered Sandrais, but I don't want to, um, so we'll

08:58.920 --> 08:59.920
see.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.440
Um, I think, I think that's all I was going to get.

09:01.440 --> 09:05.520
I almost bought Orange Box, but once again, you know, I just don't see myself playing

09:05.520 --> 09:06.520
through Half Life.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.680
I know it's a good game, but I just, when I had the Orange Box, I played Portal and

09:10.680 --> 09:12.120
that was pretty much it.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.420
Although Team Fortress 2 I hear is good, but that's free, so I don't really need the Orange

09:15.420 --> 09:16.420
Box for that.

09:16.420 --> 09:21.680
Um, but yeah, so Arma 2 is only the new thing that I bought, but, uh, I'm looking forward

09:21.680 --> 09:26.120
to checking out DayZ, which is that zombie, uh, thing that they've got.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.840
It's supposed to be all sorts of craziness and boring at the same time.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.200
Isn't the Orange Box have like every Half Life thing in it?

09:33.200 --> 09:37.760
Yeah, it's Half Life, Half Life 2 Episode 1 and Episode 2 and, well, and then the original

09:37.760 --> 09:43.200
game, and then, uh, Portal and Team Fortress 2, but I don't need to play through Portal

09:43.200 --> 09:44.760
again because I've played through that a few times.

09:44.760 --> 09:48.440
I'm pretty sure Alan would tell you Half Life is the best thing you're gonna get.

09:48.440 --> 09:52.620
It's really, I play Half Life 2 and the episodes like twice a year.

09:52.620 --> 09:57.080
But they, the thing is with that is they mark this stuff down all the time, so it's not

09:57.080 --> 09:59.160
like, ooh, I missed my only opportunity for this.

09:59.160 --> 10:04.400
I mean, seriously, they mark this stuff down all the time and I'm sure if I go to a GameStop

10:04.400 --> 10:08.200
or something like that, I'm sure they got a copy of the Orange Box on PC or even Half

10:08.200 --> 10:14.000
Life 2 just sitting there rotting that I could probably take off their hands for, you know,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
nothing.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.880
Let me ask a completely random, tangible question because we were talking about Half Life and,

10:19.880 --> 10:26.200
you know, I know that it seems like Valve is trolling you with Half Life 3, right Alan?

10:26.200 --> 10:31.560
Either Half Life 3 or Half Life 2 Episode 3, whatever they wanna do.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.320
But it seems like nothing's ever gonna happen, right?

10:33.320 --> 10:39.880
Yeah, it's now been longer from Half Life Episode 2 today to current day than it was

10:39.880 --> 10:42.040
from Half Life 1 to Half Life 2.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.080
Do you worry that if, you know, Half Life 3 ever does come out at some point that it's

10:46.080 --> 10:51.480
gonna be like Diablo 3 and what I mean by that is, I think most people, not all, but

10:51.480 --> 10:56.520
most people kinda consider Diablo 3 a letdown for a variety of reasons, be it that auction

10:56.520 --> 10:59.440
house or the lack of, you know, offline play or something.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.600
I think the only reason why there hasn't been Half Life 3 is because they need to develop

11:03.600 --> 11:04.600
a new engine.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.920
I mean, they've been using the Source engine forever now, so it's time that they come out

11:07.920 --> 11:09.640
with a new engine.

11:09.640 --> 11:14.360
But let me go back to the question for Alan, do you worry that Half Life 3 may end up being

11:14.360 --> 11:16.360
a disappointment?

11:16.360 --> 11:23.160
Well, it kinda reminds me, you know the series Lost and how weird it was and there was a,

11:23.160 --> 11:26.960
some of the fans were like, they totally know how it's gonna end and the other half of the

11:26.960 --> 11:30.920
fans were like, they're making this shit up as they go along.

11:30.920 --> 11:36.800
Half Life, I'm afraid the story might get too big for them to reign in and the story

11:36.800 --> 11:42.200
might be weird, but otherwise, I mean, it's just gonna be a first person shooter.

11:42.200 --> 11:47.440
It's Valve, Valve's pedigree is very high, so I don't really expect them to drop the

11:47.440 --> 11:49.760
ball that much on it.

11:49.760 --> 11:53.440
Game guru in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com seems to agree with Loki.

11:53.440 --> 11:58.040
I think Half Life 3 will come out if and only if they create a new engine for their games.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.600
They need a Source 2.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.360
I think they are gonna create a new engine for their game because it's getting dated.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.320
But I mean, it's good, they make good games and the engine still looks pretty nice, but

12:06.320 --> 12:10.840
it's just, they're gonna need to come out with something at some point.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.000
I mean, it's gonna have to happen because it's gonna get dated.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.800
Yeah, because Source as it is, which it's the first generation of it was 2003 or 2004

12:19.800 --> 12:22.800
when Half Life 2 came out, it's been updated four or five times.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
Yeah.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.240
But it's still the core engine.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.520
Is that what's running Portal 2?

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
Yes.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.520
Wow.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.280
Yes, it's a modified Source and Left 4 Dead 2 is also a modified Source.

12:32.280 --> 12:35.560
Portal 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 are both, they both still look great, but I understand the

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
desire to...

12:36.560 --> 12:39.280
It's the physics and stuff.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.280
That's all the same.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.000
Maybe Valve is waiting for the next wave of consoles, maybe at this point don't make a

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
PlayStation 3 game.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.600
They just need to come out with a game that's just all the Source games kind of combined

12:47.600 --> 12:48.600
in the one.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.440
You got a little bit of Half Life, you got a little bit of Portal in there, a little

12:50.440 --> 12:54.440
bit of Left 4 Dead, just a mix, you know, just a mixing of everything.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.560
A little bit of Team Fortress 2.

12:56.560 --> 13:02.600
Half Life 2 Episode 3 was supposed to heavily involve Aperture Science.

13:02.600 --> 13:10.600
And because Portal was such a huge hit, it almost makes me wonder if they want to keep

13:10.600 --> 13:13.120
those worlds separate now.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.960
Because you're supposed to go up to like the North Pole or the South Pole to find the ship

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
and blah, blah, blah.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.000
So yeah, Aperture Science was supposed to be in Episode 3 and now I don't know if they're

13:23.000 --> 13:24.640
trying to write their way around that.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.760
Because of all the story in Portal 2 about Aperture Science, certainly.

13:27.760 --> 13:28.760
Yeah.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.040
That could be an interesting monkey wrench.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.520
Anyhow, I didn't mean to get us too far on the tangent.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.720
Let's go back to how Steam Sale wrecked your week.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.720
Anything else, Loki, that you bought on the sale?

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
No, that was it.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.000
Just those three games.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.560
I'll go.

13:42.560 --> 13:49.480
I bought Civilization V for Alan because just like how I bully him into coming on this show,

13:49.480 --> 13:54.160
clearly, I'm going to talk to him about playing Civ V with me.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.160
Aren't you excited?

13:55.160 --> 13:56.160
Yes.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
I installed it.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
Hooray!

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
That's progress.

13:59.160 --> 14:05.480
I bought Civ V Gods and Kings for myself because it was like 20% off, which I figured for a

14:05.480 --> 14:08.720
game that's only like two months old is probably as low as it's going to get.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.960
So I bought that.

14:09.960 --> 14:15.680
And I bought a four-pack of Dungeon Defenders because it was cheap and I heard it's kind

14:15.680 --> 14:17.000
of good, so I bought that.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.200
Why'd you buy four of them?

14:19.200 --> 14:22.040
So that I could give Alan one and I gave one to another.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.040
I gave one to Shane.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.640
What is Dungeon Defenders anyway?

14:24.640 --> 14:26.280
I haven't decided what I'm doing with the fourth one yet.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.080
It's co-op tower defense, I think.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.840
That sounds fun.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.840
Do you not have it, Loki?

14:30.840 --> 14:31.840
I don't have it.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
Well, now you do.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.840
There's my fourth copy.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.840
There you go.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
Sweet.

14:35.840 --> 14:36.840
I bought it for Loki.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.840
I did it for you, bro.

14:37.840 --> 14:38.840
Thank you.

14:38.840 --> 14:39.840
All right.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
There you go.

14:40.840 --> 14:41.840
That's one genre I haven't really gotten into.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
Tower defense stuff.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.840
Well, actually, I guess I have.

14:43.840 --> 14:49.040
I play the stick war games on the IOS, but I kind of, I don't know, it'd be fun.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.040
All right.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.040
And I'm trying to think.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.040
There was something else.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.040
Oh, yeah.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.160
I bought Skyrim, which I think I talked about on last week's show.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.920
My memory's a little fuzzy, but I bought Skyrim on PC just because I wanted to be able to

14:59.920 --> 15:00.920
mod it.

15:00.920 --> 15:06.120
And, you know, I had it on PlayStation 3, but it's just not, it's not PC.

15:06.120 --> 15:12.200
And I got to say, after installing that high res texture pack and everything, very nice,

15:12.200 --> 15:15.040
very nice, very nice looking game.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.280
And all the mods are very cool and the Steam Workshop, and it's very easy to get that stuff

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
in there.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.180
And Alan, Alan's great.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.960
He sent me an email saying like, okay, here are the must have mods.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.520
You need this and this and this and this, and he just gave me a list.

15:27.520 --> 15:33.680
All quality of life stuff, like the default UI for inventory and spells is shit.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.220
So here's a mod that makes it pretty.

15:36.220 --> 15:40.960
Tiger Claw, who's participating with the show at live.vognetwork.com says, can your PC run

15:40.960 --> 15:42.360
Skyrim fine?

15:42.360 --> 15:43.940
Yeah, it's running great.

15:43.940 --> 15:48.680
I don't think it's like the highest, highest settings, but my video card's fairly new.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.600
It's only about a year old and, you know, I have a fairly powerful PC.

15:52.600 --> 15:53.600
It's just very loud.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.240
That's the only problem with my PC is that when the fans are running, you should hear

15:57.240 --> 15:58.600
mine because it's under the desk.

15:58.600 --> 15:59.600
That's why it's muted.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
Mine's a beast.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.640
Your PC is way better than mine and I run games fine, so you shouldn't have a problem.

16:04.640 --> 16:09.000
My PC at home, I need to upgrade everything on it because, you know, it was back when

16:09.000 --> 16:13.400
the 8800, you know, Nvidia cards were new.

16:13.400 --> 16:23.840
So I have a dual 8800 GTS 512s running SLI and have a dual core because it was a core

16:23.840 --> 16:27.860
2 dual before they had all these i5s, i7s and stuff like that.

16:27.860 --> 16:31.920
But it's overclocked to almost 4 gigs.

16:31.920 --> 16:37.560
But it's still, you know, those cards kind of hold it back.

16:37.560 --> 16:43.480
Bobby Blackwolf who tapes before us at 5 o'clock Pacific 8 Eastern at VODnetwork.com every

16:43.480 --> 16:47.920
Sunday night is sending a link that he, I saw your tweet on this earlier, Bobby.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.920
That's how I know what this is.

16:48.920 --> 16:55.840
It's the Minecraft mod for Skyrim that actually changes your companion to Steve the Minecraft

16:55.840 --> 16:56.840
dude and all that.

16:56.840 --> 17:02.320
I'm just afraid once I do start modding this is it's going to get weird really fast because

17:02.320 --> 17:06.200
I'm going to have to get, you know, the macho man dragon mod.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.320
Oh, I got to get that still.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.880
Thank you for reminding me.

17:10.880 --> 17:17.200
That one also, a quick, I guess a, we actually have somebody in chat too named macho man,

17:17.200 --> 17:18.840
so maybe you'll get an, oh yeah.

17:18.840 --> 17:24.720
So there's also, you know, the, in case you're not a macho man fan, they have the My Little

17:24.720 --> 17:29.640
Pony ones that turn the dragons into that and the extra magic, the extra magic one is

17:29.640 --> 17:30.640
pretty cool.

17:30.640 --> 17:33.400
They have different, let's just be real.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.160
It's for the weed smokers.

17:35.160 --> 17:40.600
They have, they have the Brony mod for the weed smokers.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.760
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.280
I'm just saying.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.580
I just want to see what kind of, I mean it's going to look nothing like that.

17:48.580 --> 17:49.580
That's the fun of it.

17:49.580 --> 17:50.580
Like I've played Skyrim.

17:50.580 --> 17:53.600
Skyrim is fun and I'm still playing it on 360.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.040
I haven't, I haven't picked up DLC cause I think it's a waste of money right now.

17:57.040 --> 18:01.980
But um, I just want to make the PC version look nothing like the original game and just

18:01.980 --> 18:05.360
have it be frigging crazy.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.360
Just batshit crazy.

18:08.360 --> 18:12.820
Black Wolf is also asking in chat, can Alan post his essential Skyrim mod list to the

18:12.820 --> 18:13.820
forums?

18:13.820 --> 18:17.840
Well, I've actually been trying to nudge him into doing an article for the site on that.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.500
Nudge, nudge, nudge, nudge.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.360
Can I talk about the steam workshop?

18:21.360 --> 18:22.360
Yes sir.

18:22.360 --> 18:28.280
As someone who likes to mod PC games, the steam workshop is amazing and how incredibly

18:28.280 --> 18:30.800
easy it is to just install a mod.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.860
And if you don't like it, it's gone.

18:32.860 --> 18:35.140
It's like a one click process within steam.

18:35.140 --> 18:40.800
The problem that I have with it is that a lot of really awesome mod authors aren't on

18:40.800 --> 18:45.980
it just because they don't, they're fine with nexus, which was the old school modding site.

18:45.980 --> 18:50.600
So there's a lot of amazing Skyrim mods, especially UI and quality of life stuff that isn't on

18:50.600 --> 18:52.020
the steam workshop.

18:52.020 --> 18:57.600
So if I make a list, I can say, here's how you install stuff from nexus, but here's the

18:57.600 --> 18:58.840
easy stuff from steam workshop.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
I don't know.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.220
I think it's okay.

19:01.220 --> 19:04.680
I have faith that most of our listeners could figure it out.

19:04.680 --> 19:10.620
Well, yeah, a lot of people are intimidated by modding and the steam workshop is absolutely,

19:10.620 --> 19:13.740
it's an amazing progression.

19:13.740 --> 19:18.300
It's very innovative on that stuff, but it's kind of split the community up a bit because

19:18.300 --> 19:20.160
now there's two different sources for mods.

19:20.160 --> 19:24.420
ActDeft is trying to share this mod that he says I should get called the Yay mod.

19:24.420 --> 19:26.700
He says, screw the Macho Man mod, get the Yay mod.

19:26.700 --> 19:27.980
And I'm like, dear God, what is that?

19:27.980 --> 19:28.980
And he sent me a YouTube.

19:28.980 --> 19:34.220
Usually I don't play YouTube on the show without looking at them first, but for Yay mod, I'll

19:34.220 --> 19:35.500
take a risk.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.500
ActDeft don't ruin my show.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.500
Here we go.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.500
Let's see.

19:39.500 --> 19:47.340
So the guys in the dungeon, see what happens.

19:47.340 --> 19:51.140
If you don't know the elements of good cheer yet, you should try out these cheat codes.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.740
I don't know what that's going to do.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.220
All right.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.940
ActDeft when does this get good?

19:56.940 --> 19:59.260
Oh, the guy's typing it in.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.260
Let's see what happens.

20:01.260 --> 20:08.540
I think it was only a minute and a half long.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.460
Come on.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.420
Okay.

20:13.420 --> 20:19.540
Nothing good's happening.

20:19.540 --> 20:23.460
ActDeft you should have just gave you a timestamp and said, bump it to like a minute, five

20:23.460 --> 20:29.180
five.

20:29.180 --> 20:35.860
I'm more interested in this because everything's in German right now.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.500
I'm sure dragon shouts in German are terrifying.

20:38.500 --> 20:47.420
I just realized it says my little pony friendship is magic in the title, so I'm a little worried.

20:47.420 --> 20:51.180
I might need to smoke a little bit of something before this will actually make sense.

20:51.180 --> 20:55.340
Is that the trick?

20:55.340 --> 20:58.060
It's probably a dragon shout that's my little pony.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.540
There's now a dragon shout that says yay.

21:01.540 --> 21:08.980
Now to the fun part with 10 seconds left in the video.

21:08.980 --> 21:09.980
That's it?

21:09.980 --> 21:10.980
Yay.

21:10.980 --> 21:16.940
Oh, and I give that on a scale of one to 10, about a 1.5.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.780
Sorry, ActDeft.

21:18.780 --> 21:20.540
That was the stoppage of the show.

21:20.540 --> 21:25.900
And Bobby Black Wolf in chat said, Wolf rather, that he's installed mods from Nexus.

21:25.900 --> 21:33.060
Nexus does have its own little Nexus mod manager app, but a lot of people are like, I don't

21:33.060 --> 21:37.120
want to install this five meg little weird ass app.

21:37.120 --> 21:42.700
So it kind of has a Steam Workshop alternative, but yeah, I can post all that to the forums.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.700
Sounds good.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.700
Yeah.

21:44.700 --> 21:48.460
Oh, and another thing about the Steam Workshop, and this is because I'm a huge pervert.

21:48.460 --> 21:54.820
Sometimes mods, modders, especially in like the Grand Theft Auto franchise, like to make

21:54.820 --> 21:59.260
people naked or make their clothes really slutty, even if you strip them and they still

21:59.260 --> 22:04.740
have underwear on, just like cleavage and the big boobs, that stuff's not on Steam Workshop.

22:04.740 --> 22:10.940
So if you want an NC-17 R-rated Skyrim, like I do, you're going to want to go to Nexus

22:10.940 --> 22:11.940
for that.

22:11.940 --> 22:16.220
Hey man, they do some good work on Lydia.

22:16.220 --> 22:21.300
Yeah, there's a bunch of Lydia mods where it's not appropriate for this show.

22:21.300 --> 22:25.900
That's what we're talking about, this show is appropriate for everything.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.820
This isn't the Bobby Black Wolf show, Alan.

22:27.820 --> 22:32.180
They have some deep cleavage for those characters.

22:32.180 --> 22:37.580
All right, Alan, what was the damage for you this week, because I know you went shopping.

22:37.580 --> 22:43.100
Oh yeah, I think from the very first day of the sale, I think it's dinged me collectively

22:43.100 --> 22:50.660
for, I want to say 50 or 55 bucks, but it's $3.50 here, $8.99 here.

22:50.660 --> 22:57.780
The big thing that I got was Saints Row 3 was knocked down to like $7.49 and then that

22:57.780 --> 23:01.820
plus all of the DLC, all of it, I think was like $22.99.

23:01.820 --> 23:04.700
So I picked that up, just inhaled all that down.

23:04.700 --> 23:12.020
Spoiler, most of the DLC sucks, actually spoiler, all of the DLC sucks.

23:12.020 --> 23:17.260
One thing I noticed, and you're the one who pointed this out, there's the daily sales

23:17.260 --> 23:18.940
that actually last about two hours.

23:18.940 --> 23:23.340
There are the flash sales and then there are the community vote sales.

23:23.340 --> 23:29.420
Those prices have been cycling through every day or like twice a day every other day for

23:29.420 --> 23:30.680
the whole sale.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.100
It's a genius move on Valve's part because it makes it look like they're putting all

23:34.100 --> 23:38.880
this stuff constantly on sale, but all it is, they have the daily sales and the votes

23:38.880 --> 23:43.380
and the flash sales are just the same things as the daily sales, just cycling through at

23:43.380 --> 23:44.380
random intervals.

23:44.380 --> 23:45.380
It's genius.

23:45.380 --> 23:48.580
If the thing that you voted on for the community sale didn't win, it's probably going to be

23:48.580 --> 23:52.300
a part of the daily sale the next day or the day after, or it'll be one of the flash sales

23:52.300 --> 23:53.300
at the bottom.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.940
So you're going to get that game.

23:54.940 --> 23:58.500
Well, remember that for Christmas because it's too late now.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.500
Because remember when Civ 5, I think, was like, what, eight bucks?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.600
And people were like, fuck, I missed Civ 5 for eight bucks.

24:03.600 --> 24:07.220
It's been eight bucks like three separate times since that you said that.

24:07.220 --> 24:10.980
So they keep bringing those prices back and making us think they're unique.

24:10.980 --> 24:13.140
All right.

24:13.140 --> 24:16.920
So I think we've talked enough about our Steam addiction this week and the stuff we've bought.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.320
Let's get into a similar topic because it's how we always start the show.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.500
How was your gaming week?

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
What?

24:23.500 --> 24:25.540
Because the Steam sale is just about buying a bunch of games.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.100
It doesn't mean you're going to play them.

24:27.100 --> 24:29.140
So what did you actually play this week?

24:29.140 --> 24:30.140
How was your gaming week?

24:30.140 --> 24:31.140
Sorry.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.460
I had to make one more purchase here real quick.

24:33.460 --> 24:34.460
Oh, God.

24:34.460 --> 24:35.460
What happened?

24:35.460 --> 24:36.460
Just Cause 2 is $3.74.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.700
That game is fucking awesome.

24:38.700 --> 24:42.460
And for $3.74, I have to buy that.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.460
Feed Gabe Newell.

24:43.460 --> 24:44.460
Feed him.

24:44.460 --> 24:45.460
I can't stop.

24:45.460 --> 24:49.900
See, like, before, like, was it the stupid indie?

24:49.900 --> 24:54.100
I blame the humble indie bundles because, God damn it, I didn't have Steam and all this

24:54.100 --> 24:55.540
shit before that.

24:55.540 --> 24:59.500
And now, and now I'm sucked into this.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.500
All right.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.100
Well, I'm not going to tell you not to do it, but I am going to say pause for a minute

25:03.100 --> 25:04.540
and tell us about your gaming week first.

25:04.540 --> 25:05.540
All right.

25:05.540 --> 25:06.540
All right.

25:06.540 --> 25:07.540
Thanks.

25:07.540 --> 25:12.100
So this week, I played Borderlands because I picked it up on the Steam sale on PC.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.060
So I've been kind of going back and replaying that again since I want to kind of remember

25:16.060 --> 25:21.980
a little bit what happens for the, you know, sequel so that I can, you know, bust that

25:21.980 --> 25:24.740
out when it comes out in September.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.420
And it's fun.

25:27.420 --> 25:28.420
I like it.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.640
And of course, I went ahead and modded it again.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.900
It's been a while since I've actually played that game.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.700
So they've patched it a few more times and you can't do some of the really cool guns

25:36.700 --> 25:38.080
that you had before.

25:38.080 --> 25:43.700
But there's still, like, some pretty awesome ones in there that you can mod.

25:43.700 --> 25:44.700
So I have some of those.

25:44.700 --> 25:47.420
I have a pistol now that takes people's heads off and stuff.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.660
Oh, how pleasant.

25:48.660 --> 25:53.460
It just makes them explode, it's like, hi, mirror gun.

25:53.460 --> 25:54.460
So there's that.

25:54.460 --> 25:59.620
And then, let's see, besides Borderlands, I actually finished, I was installing a bunch

25:59.620 --> 26:00.620
of stuff.

26:00.620 --> 26:06.260
I have I Wanna Be The Guy, the original, played a little bit of that, just like maybe 15 minutes

26:06.260 --> 26:07.260
of it.

26:07.260 --> 26:10.860
And then I Wanna Be The Guy, I played a little bit of that.

26:10.860 --> 26:16.740
The only thing I don't like about it, and I'm sure this is on purpose, is like the little,

26:16.740 --> 26:22.340
they have this sort of Super Mario World world select screen or whatever that, of course,

26:22.340 --> 26:25.700
you can die in because, you know, I want to be the guy.

26:25.700 --> 26:29.460
And I don't like the fact that you can't stop moving in that because it's, you know, you

26:29.460 --> 26:33.060
push left to right and your guy just keeps walking and there's a spot where you have

26:33.060 --> 26:37.860
to kind of sit still before, you know, you do something.

26:37.860 --> 26:41.540
So it's a little annoying, but I'm sure it's like that on purpose.

26:41.540 --> 26:46.220
Then I played a little bit of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3, we played the new terminal

26:46.220 --> 26:50.820
map that they had, which was kind of a remake from Modern Warfare 2.

26:50.820 --> 26:54.320
And it's a great map, so we've been enjoying that quite a bit.

26:54.320 --> 26:58.200
Haven't really been practicing too much for the tournament coming up, although I have

26:58.200 --> 27:03.780
been playing my class that I'm going to be using for the tournament because, like I mentioned

27:03.780 --> 27:08.440
last week, I'm going to be entering a Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 tournament one, almost

27:08.440 --> 27:09.500
a week from today.

27:09.500 --> 27:13.060
It's next Saturday, so I'm looking forward to that.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.060
That'll be kind of fun.

27:14.060 --> 27:17.580
Driving down to Stockton for those.

27:17.580 --> 27:18.780
That's next week?

27:18.780 --> 27:19.780
That's next week.

27:19.780 --> 27:20.780
It's going to be a big week next week.

27:20.780 --> 27:21.780
Yeah.

27:21.780 --> 27:22.780
Excited.

27:22.780 --> 27:23.780
I was going to do that.

27:23.780 --> 27:30.700
Minecraft's been playing my new world I started with my coworker, and we've been playing that

27:30.700 --> 27:33.140
just on Easy.

27:33.140 --> 27:36.500
And it's kind of a different type of game.

27:36.500 --> 27:45.540
I created a mob drowning machine thing, so it drowns some of the mobs and some of them

27:45.540 --> 27:47.540
get through.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.180
But it's kind of interesting.

27:49.180 --> 27:58.660
And I don't know, just I think that was about, oh, I had been selling some stuff on eBay.

27:58.660 --> 28:03.080
I guess I must have bought something on eBay not too long ago because I had like $6 worth

28:03.080 --> 28:12.300
of, it was like $6.60 in eBay bucks that they have you earn like, I don't remember what

28:12.300 --> 28:15.160
the ratio is, but you're in like free money basically.

28:15.160 --> 28:20.820
So I was bored one day, I'm like, okay, I never really spend these, so I'm going to

28:20.820 --> 28:24.660
find something that's gaming related under $6.60.

28:24.660 --> 28:27.840
I'm going to try to find the best value for my money.

28:27.840 --> 28:33.820
And so I was searching around and I actually found a digital copy of Child of Eden for

28:33.820 --> 28:35.780
$6.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.540
So I picked that up because that's a no brainer.

28:38.540 --> 28:43.820
So hopefully I'll get back to playing that on the 360 again.

28:43.820 --> 28:48.260
And I think that's all I played this week.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.260
Awesome.

28:49.260 --> 28:52.300
I'll go next because I didn't play a lot of new games this week.

28:52.300 --> 28:55.500
I mean, I think I talked about most of the stuff in the Steam sale.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.020
I didn't play enough Dungeon Defenders to really review it yet.

28:58.020 --> 28:59.860
So I'll come back to that next week.

28:59.860 --> 29:04.180
I did play a little bit of Civ V Gods and Kings, but I didn't, like, you know, you have

29:04.180 --> 29:07.060
to really book out a chunk of time to play that game.

29:07.060 --> 29:10.340
And I started playing it and I didn't really have a whole lot of time and I was playing

29:10.340 --> 29:11.340
sloppy.

29:11.340 --> 29:16.140
And for some reason I decided to go for a military victory and I never do military victories.

29:16.140 --> 29:18.660
And I was spreading myself too thin on all fronts.

29:18.660 --> 29:23.420
So I was getting my butt kicked on like an easy level and I was like, forget it, stop,

29:23.420 --> 29:24.420
delete.

29:24.420 --> 29:25.420
I'll come back to this later.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.420
So yeah.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.860
Didn't really get to do a whole lot there.

29:28.860 --> 29:33.940
Played a little bit of WoW, played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 online on PC.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.780
And I got to admit, I'm a little disappointed.

29:35.780 --> 29:37.620
I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth.

29:37.620 --> 29:38.620
You all know.

29:38.620 --> 29:39.620
Go ahead.

29:39.620 --> 29:43.260
Double fold, there's two reasons, well, one reason for me, two reasons for you on why

29:43.260 --> 29:46.020
it's shitty and why you're not going to play it anymore.

29:46.020 --> 29:49.720
Well, I don't know, like I'm threatening not to play it anymore, but I think we all know

29:49.720 --> 29:54.580
somebody will be like, please come play with me and I'll be like, okay.

29:54.580 --> 29:58.980
But I'm just, I'm really frustrated and a lot of it has to do with connection issues.

29:58.980 --> 30:04.740
Origin, and I hate to say this because I know people that work at Origin, but it's not good.

30:04.740 --> 30:08.500
Like I'm sorry, I can't, I'm really frustrated with it.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.340
And a lot of it has to do with connection issues.

30:10.340 --> 30:14.420
I'm consistently having on Origin and this whole, Alan, you can explain it better than

30:14.420 --> 30:19.420
I can, the two, two people in one place can't battle two people in another place.

30:19.420 --> 30:24.380
So a very obvious four person setup, couple and couple playing the game together.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.380
It won't, yeah.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.380
It won't do it.

30:26.380 --> 30:27.380
Origin won't let you do it.

30:27.380 --> 30:28.380
Yeah.

30:28.380 --> 30:29.380
Cause we're, we play on NAT via router.

30:29.380 --> 30:31.420
We just have the one IP and that's cool.

30:31.420 --> 30:36.360
Rob and myself can go in, we can play our own separate matches.

30:36.360 --> 30:41.540
We can do co-op with two public pugs that we let in through the like the public match.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.540
That's fine.

30:42.540 --> 30:50.780
But Origin, it's network kernel can only keep track of one IP with two sessions on it.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.260
It can't do it for another IP with two sessions on it.

30:53.260 --> 30:57.980
So when we try to play with our friends who are in the exact same setup as us, the third

30:57.980 --> 30:59.620
person could get, could get on.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.740
But when the fourth person tries, they time out.

31:02.740 --> 31:06.820
Or if the match is already in progress, it will time out the person at their house while

31:06.820 --> 31:08.020
the fourth person tries to get in.

31:08.020 --> 31:13.940
I know this makes no sense at this point, but yeah, it's TLDR, it's shitty.

31:13.940 --> 31:18.580
It's shitty and it's peer to peer, which is why it has this problem XBLA and I think PSN

31:18.580 --> 31:20.820
is all server based.

31:20.820 --> 31:24.260
So the matching service on Mass Effect 3 is, is peer to peer and that's why it has all

31:24.260 --> 31:25.260
these problems.

31:25.260 --> 31:29.300
And let me tell you what I've had to put up with to play what is otherwise a great game.

31:29.300 --> 31:35.180
Again, I don't get into online shooter games ever, but Mass Effect 3, which isn't really

31:35.180 --> 31:38.160
a shooter, but it kind of is, like it has defied that trend.

31:38.160 --> 31:43.980
But what I have to do to play this fucking game on Origin, log into the game, wait while

31:43.980 --> 31:45.780
it connects to Origin.

31:45.780 --> 31:48.260
Okay, game is connected to Origin.

31:48.260 --> 31:54.480
Now the menu is up, wait while it loads my galacticness ready, readiness rating or whatever

31:54.480 --> 31:55.480
it's called.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.460
Okay, now select multiplayer, wait for multiplayer to load.

31:59.460 --> 32:01.180
All right, let me connect to my friend.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.180
Wait to connect to the friend.

32:02.180 --> 32:05.300
It takes like four minutes to get into a freaking match.

32:05.300 --> 32:09.140
I bet what it's doing for those first two big lags when it opens up the galactic, I

32:09.140 --> 32:13.460
bet that's all like the DRM, Origin security stuff going through.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.700
It's gotta be.

32:14.700 --> 32:15.740
Which is ridiculous.

32:15.740 --> 32:21.660
Like it's stopped, like do it once, do it once every 10 connections just to stop bogging

32:21.660 --> 32:24.100
my game down because it's really ruining it for me.

32:24.100 --> 32:29.060
And then what really just set me over the edge was that we played a game the other night.

32:29.060 --> 32:30.540
It was me, you and our friend Tim.

32:30.540 --> 32:34.180
We were three manning some bronze maps, which we can do to full extraction.

32:34.180 --> 32:35.440
And we were playing those online.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.860
We played two matches and I got about 30,000 credits.

32:38.860 --> 32:43.540
I leveled one guy from 19 to 20 and another, my engineer from like one to six.

32:43.540 --> 32:45.740
Yeah, lost all that.

32:45.740 --> 32:50.700
After I disconnected from the match, lost it all, rolled back, wrote EA customer support.

32:50.700 --> 32:51.980
Please give me back what I lost.

32:51.980 --> 32:54.420
I got a reply back, sorry, can't do that.

32:54.420 --> 32:56.220
No, you can do it.

32:56.220 --> 33:00.140
You don't want to because you think I'm trying to, you know, get it from you or steal it

33:00.140 --> 33:01.140
from you.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.140
This is ridiculous.

33:02.140 --> 33:03.140
And I'm kind of over it.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.140
Yeah.

33:04.140 --> 33:06.900
Xbox has its share of connection problems too, honestly.

33:06.900 --> 33:11.500
Cause with Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, aside from the galactic readiness and the first

33:11.500 --> 33:14.580
player part of it, there's the challenge.

33:14.580 --> 33:19.800
But then aside from the challenge of shooting shit, you get credits and you buy these goodie

33:19.800 --> 33:22.100
packs and you unlock new characters.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.860
That's why people play Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is because they want to play as a Vortia.

33:25.860 --> 33:27.940
They want to play as an Asari.

33:27.940 --> 33:33.100
So if you're not getting your credits, that's, that's why you're playing is to buy it unless

33:33.100 --> 33:35.300
you want to get Bioware points, but.

33:35.300 --> 33:40.980
Which I refuse to, and then I have saved up for so many of these packs and then this gets

33:40.980 --> 33:43.460
into a little bit of like, you know, it's not fair.

33:43.460 --> 33:44.460
The game's not fair.

33:44.460 --> 33:48.060
I have yet, I've unlocked two characters out of like the 40 there is.

33:48.060 --> 33:52.340
And the way you unlock stuff is ridiculous because it's all RNG.

33:52.340 --> 33:56.380
You buy a goodie box and then pray you get the shit you want in it.

33:56.380 --> 33:58.780
And it's totally random.

33:58.780 --> 34:03.860
So Osfer says in our chat room, just calm down and play the game on 360 after the show

34:03.860 --> 34:04.860
tonight.

34:04.860 --> 34:06.100
We'll have a proper multiplayer game.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.100
Yeah, I can play it on PC.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.580
You can play it on 360.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.580
Maybe.

34:09.580 --> 34:13.420
I mean, I'm not saying no to like playing games on 360, but like all these issues, no

34:13.420 --> 34:16.940
matter what platform, I'm kind of like over Mass Effect 3 multiplayer and I'm ready for

34:16.940 --> 34:20.580
a new game and I'm ready for some single player content.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.540
That's why we're going to play Borderlands, maybe.

34:23.540 --> 34:24.540
Maybe.

34:24.540 --> 34:25.540
Or Civ V, maybe.

34:25.540 --> 34:32.540
You do realize Borderlands 2, you can play split screen on one Xbox 360 system and then

34:32.540 --> 34:36.420
also with that split screen play against other people.

34:36.420 --> 34:40.820
You know, we can do co-op and you can both play on the same TV.

34:40.820 --> 34:44.460
Come to Borderlands 2.

34:44.460 --> 34:46.260
I want to check out Borderlands 1 again.

34:46.260 --> 34:49.340
I only played it a little bit before and got distracted, so yeah, I'll definitely check

34:49.340 --> 34:50.340
that out.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.340
Fantastic.

34:51.340 --> 34:52.340
Yeah.

34:52.340 --> 34:56.940
So, um, yeah, that's my little like origin rant and just, it's, it's, it's set me as

34:56.940 --> 35:03.580
it is setting EA as a company back, but of course EA is doing it to themselves.

35:03.580 --> 35:07.740
So you know, what can you do?

35:07.740 --> 35:11.460
So um, let's see, I guess that's it for my gaming week.

35:11.460 --> 35:12.460
I've ran it enough.

35:12.460 --> 35:13.460
Alan, how about you?

35:13.460 --> 35:19.140
Um, Mass Effect 3, we already talked about that plenty, so I'm not going to get into

35:19.140 --> 35:20.140
that.

35:20.140 --> 35:22.900
LA Noire, which I've been playing, I'm almost near the end.

35:22.900 --> 35:27.720
I kind of want to beat it, not because it's boring, but I am using a FAQ so I can get

35:27.720 --> 35:31.500
everything the first time through and just follow the narrative of it.

35:31.500 --> 35:36.100
And with the FAQ, that game's kind of boring, whereas other games, if you follow a FAQ,

35:36.100 --> 35:41.700
you still have the, the mechanics of it keeping it fun.

35:41.700 --> 35:45.660
So a shitload of LA Noire, um, thanks to the Steam sale, it was dirt cheap.

35:45.660 --> 35:51.300
So I got it for like 10, 12 bucks with it and all the DLC cases, um, enjoying that.

35:51.300 --> 35:54.820
Uh, I was playing Saints Row the third.

35:54.820 --> 35:59.180
I'm on the mission where you parachute onto the top of the building and Kanye West is

35:59.180 --> 36:00.180
playing.

36:00.180 --> 36:08.340
Yeah, that's, it's like an hour or so or so in, um, played a lot with the character creator,

36:08.340 --> 36:10.660
um, in that, uh, oh,

36:10.660 --> 36:12.940
Oh, you have that game on PC, right?

36:12.940 --> 36:13.940
Yeah.

36:13.940 --> 36:14.940
Yeah.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.420
You might check a gentleman of the row.

36:16.420 --> 36:20.780
They have a lot of cool enhancements and stuff for both Saints Row two and Saints Row the

36:20.780 --> 36:21.780
third.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.300
Have you been, uh, have you been laughing your ass off at Saints Row three?

36:25.300 --> 36:27.300
Like I was especially that parachuting thing.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.300
Yeah.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.300
It was funny.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.500
Cause you throw Shonda, you're just like, I'll catch you later.

36:31.500 --> 36:32.540
She's like, I'm dying.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.680
We're falling towards the ground and yeah.

36:35.680 --> 36:37.660
And people are shooting at you with no, no parachutes on.

36:37.660 --> 36:40.780
They're killing themselves trying to kill you.

36:40.780 --> 36:46.980
Um, I installed a game that I hadn't played in a couple of years, postal two for anyone

36:46.980 --> 36:53.420
who remembers that it's actually, it's a really, it's incredibly vulgar and offensive in a

36:53.420 --> 36:56.420
lot of ways, but it's a first person shooter.

36:56.420 --> 37:00.340
It's, you know, data it's seven days of the week I got the expansion.

37:00.340 --> 37:02.720
So I was playing postal two for some reason.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.860
I'm like, I just want to play a really offensive, awful first person shooter.

37:07.860 --> 37:12.700
I think, Oh, um, I guess I'll make this a part of my gaming week.

37:12.700 --> 37:19.540
I decided to check out my PSP, my slim, which is, um, got custom firmware on it.

37:19.540 --> 37:22.860
Just to see if there are any custom firmware updates, keep, you know, up to date, maybe

37:22.860 --> 37:25.340
check out some of the UMDs I have.

37:25.340 --> 37:32.700
And I noticed when I turned it on that there's this weird spotting discoloration splotches

37:32.700 --> 37:37.260
around the border of my screen and I Googled it and it turns out this is a known issue

37:37.260 --> 37:41.420
for older PSPs and we don't live here in Sacramento.

37:41.420 --> 37:42.940
It's like 102 degrees outside right now.

37:42.940 --> 37:47.980
I don't live in San Bruno anymore where it's, where it's foggy, but there's, this is a known

37:47.980 --> 37:48.980
issue.

37:48.980 --> 37:53.920
There's mold under my LCD between the glass and the backlit portion.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.540
It's it's, it's just a slight discoloration.

37:56.540 --> 38:00.860
If Jamie was here, I'd have her take a picture of it and put it on the flicker stream.

38:00.860 --> 38:03.580
Hey, I saw someone else.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.040
But I guess, yeah, this is a thing.

38:06.040 --> 38:10.940
You get mold under your L it's when I'm actually playing, when I'm actually playing like a

38:10.940 --> 38:17.420
bright game, like prep of the rapper, really any game, it's the colors and the movement

38:17.420 --> 38:18.800
doesn't really notice.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.780
I don't really notice it that much, but on like just the crossbar, the menu screen, I'm

38:21.780 --> 38:23.500
like, this sucks.

38:23.500 --> 38:30.900
I don't know if it's mold though cause it's, um, it's almost like just this, the LCD screen

38:30.900 --> 38:34.980
just kind of going out or something cause you can see if you turn it, it changes the

38:34.980 --> 38:36.260
colors and stuff of it.

38:36.260 --> 38:40.340
It looks, and it's, Ooh, it's all splotchy.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.340
Yeah.

38:41.340 --> 38:42.340
Gross.

38:42.340 --> 38:43.340
It's like a disease.

38:43.340 --> 38:44.340
It looks like your PSP has shingles.

38:44.340 --> 38:45.340
You want to put it down.

38:45.340 --> 38:46.420
I don't want to get it.

38:46.420 --> 38:51.280
So yeah, I've heard people say like, not that this is a fix for it, but someone, I was reading

38:51.280 --> 38:54.940
a forum post and someone was like, what if you put it under a UV light for like a day?

38:54.940 --> 38:57.900
Well, the UV light kill them, kill the fungus under there.

38:57.900 --> 39:02.500
And I'm like, I'm not doing that, but yeah, it's, um, if you have a PSP and it's been

39:02.500 --> 39:05.760
in your closet for a year cause you don't play PSP anymore, turn it on and see if it's

39:05.760 --> 39:09.900
got weird splotches under it.

39:09.900 --> 39:15.100
I got 2000 having a really powered it on a long time.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.860
So yeah, my PSP has crud.

39:18.860 --> 39:19.860
Wow.

39:19.860 --> 39:20.860
It needs antibiotics.

39:20.860 --> 39:24.140
You can probably just get a new screen if you want.

39:24.140 --> 39:25.140
All right.

39:25.140 --> 39:29.240
Well, uh, it's not like you leave that thing in the bathroom.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.660
You know, you would like in the bathroom, you might expect to get moldy cause you know,

39:31.660 --> 39:35.020
the steam from the shower and all that, you know, in the living room on our shelf.

39:35.020 --> 39:36.240
Yeah, that's weird.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.060
And when I, when I last turned this on here, it's not even human.

39:39.060 --> 39:42.440
When I, I think I turned this on last around Christmas and it was fine.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.420
So it's something that's happened within the last six months.

39:44.420 --> 39:45.420
Worry about my PSP now.

39:45.420 --> 39:46.420
Yeah.

39:46.420 --> 39:49.100
Cause that's, it's been years for yours and we need to watch the, or we need to turn on

39:49.100 --> 39:52.940
the Vita every couple, you're still watching Netflix on the Vita, right?

39:52.940 --> 39:53.940
Yeah.

39:53.940 --> 39:54.940
All right.

39:54.940 --> 39:55.940
Good.

39:55.940 --> 39:56.940
All right.

39:56.940 --> 39:59.500
Um, well if that's it for your gaming week, let me get into housekeeping real quick and

39:59.500 --> 40:00.500
then we'll get into the news.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.780
Um, some quick housekeeping tonight.

40:02.780 --> 40:09.220
Um, first off the summer fest for PlayStation home is next week.

40:09.220 --> 40:14.420
You can read more about that at the VOG networks website, vog network.com, but we will be live

40:14.420 --> 40:20.820
in PlayStation home kind of being there exploring in the Aurora's space and meeting some people

40:20.820 --> 40:23.900
virtually as well as broadcasting at the same time.

40:23.900 --> 40:29.120
Um, don't worry though if you don't even have a PlayStation three, nothing's going to change

40:29.120 --> 40:30.120
for you.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.020
You just, you know, you won't be able to participate in going into home, but you're not going to

40:33.020 --> 40:34.020
miss anything.

40:34.020 --> 40:36.300
We're still broadcasting the way we always do and all that.

40:36.300 --> 40:40.460
It's just kind of like we'll have a second chat room and PlayStation home that night,

40:40.460 --> 40:41.580
but we're looking forward to it.

40:41.580 --> 40:45.900
It's kind of neat cause you get to involve games and the social aspect of it and maybe

40:45.900 --> 40:50.560
meet some new listeners and some listeners that want to come into the home space.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.560
So it's a lot of fun.

40:51.560 --> 40:55.420
Uh, again, that's happening in the Aurora space during next week's Bobby Black Wolf

40:55.420 --> 40:56.420
show and our show.

40:56.420 --> 41:01.100
For more information, there's a story right in the feature bar at vog network.com.

41:01.100 --> 41:06.200
Um, also please don't forget to add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch

41:06.200 --> 41:10.460
radio and we are also on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

41:10.460 --> 41:11.460
We have a giveaway tonight.

41:11.460 --> 41:16.680
We're going to do a giveaway in part B and tonight we are giving away, thanks to one

41:16.680 --> 41:19.300
of our listeners and I really appreciate it.

41:19.300 --> 41:24.400
Bhaskar, one of our listeners is giving this away and you can tune into his blog.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.600
I believe it's crit craft is what it's called and going off the top of my head.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.900
So I want to credit his blog for providing this.

41:30.900 --> 41:37.560
It is a beta key for ravaged, ravaged was a Kickstarter funded project and it's now

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
in beta.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.560
All you need is you need steam.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.780
So we're going to give this away to a random listener in part B. If you want to win this,

41:43.780 --> 41:49.640
you have to be in our chat room and this is important and you have to be checked into

41:49.640 --> 41:53.280
the show, which you can do right now at vog network.com.

41:53.280 --> 41:57.320
You can check in to orange lounge radio right there at vog network.com.

41:57.320 --> 42:01.080
We're going to give away a beta key to somebody in the chat room who has checked into the

42:01.080 --> 42:05.480
website a little later in part B. So stay tuned for that.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.600
Uh, I think that's it.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.240
I feel like I'm forgetting something, but if I think of it, I'll, I'll come back to

42:10.240 --> 42:11.240
it later.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.760
So let's get started with tonight's news in the meantime, Loki.

42:13.760 --> 42:19.280
So I'm sure this is going to come to a shock to a lot of people, but there's a rumor that

42:19.280 --> 42:24.200
final fantasy 13 versus is dead.

42:24.200 --> 42:31.640
I know shocking that, you know, a game that we haven't seen much of for six years, um,

42:31.640 --> 42:35.260
not coming out, but, uh, yeah.

42:35.260 --> 42:41.680
And this is coming from some inside sources, um, that apparently Kotaku is talking to.

42:41.680 --> 42:47.400
And they're saying that, you know, it's officially canceled, but I mean, I don't know if it's

42:47.400 --> 42:50.920
officially canceled or if it's just going to be retitled.

42:50.920 --> 42:52.760
They haven't made a statement, right?

42:52.760 --> 42:55.200
There's no been no PR bulletin or anything.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.200
Okay.

42:56.200 --> 42:57.200
Yeah.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.840
It's, it's, uh, the last thing I think it's, we, we're almost done with preparing our latest

43:00.840 --> 43:05.160
info for the game because of a totally unrelated reason.

43:05.160 --> 43:09.800
There are circumstances in which, uh, that info cannot be released.

43:09.800 --> 43:15.780
So info for that game, maybe it's now no longer versus because honestly, 13 verses, it still

43:15.780 --> 43:20.280
didn't make any sense to me why it's called that because both games, you know, it looks

43:20.280 --> 43:23.040
nothing like final fantasy 13 at all.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.180
And there's nothing so far that they've shown us.

43:25.180 --> 43:28.240
That's led me to believe that's even in the same universe as 13.

43:28.240 --> 43:32.400
I think some of the mythology is supposed to be the same, like the whole lacy and the

43:32.400 --> 43:33.400
fallacy and all that.

43:33.400 --> 43:36.320
I think it's supposed to be like a constant because it wasn't, I want to say it was a

43:36.320 --> 43:40.080
trilogy, but there was the main story and then the two guidance side stories, one for

43:40.080 --> 43:42.280
the PSP and then versus 13.

43:42.280 --> 43:43.280
Yeah.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.160
There's supposed to be some common thread, no matter, regardless of how thin tying it

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
all together.

43:47.160 --> 43:50.520
Final fantasy, a guy toe or whatever it was called, excuse me, if I'm butchering that

43:50.520 --> 43:52.960
name, it just became fun fancy type zero.

43:52.960 --> 43:58.200
So why wouldn't find fancy 13 versus just become something else, which folks are speculating.

43:58.200 --> 44:02.840
Including me on this show a couple months ago, I think I said, why don't they just make

44:02.840 --> 44:06.840
it final fantasy 15 at this point, it would make a lot of sense because we're starting

44:06.840 --> 44:09.920
to get into the next cycle of consoles yet.

44:09.920 --> 44:14.020
We're supposed to get, I mean, you know, again, square can do whatever they want, but historically

44:14.020 --> 44:17.720
there has always been three final fantasy games on every console.

44:17.720 --> 44:18.720
Think about it.

44:18.720 --> 44:22.200
One through three was on the NES, even though two and three didn't come out here in America,

44:22.200 --> 44:24.860
four or five and six was on the super Nintendo.

44:24.860 --> 44:28.480
Even though five didn't come out in North America, but it did later seven, eight, nine,

44:28.480 --> 44:36.440
PlayStation one, 10, 11, 12, PlayStation two, 13, 14, 13, two, 13, two.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.440
Yeah.

44:37.440 --> 44:43.760
So, and technically 14 isn't out on consoles yet, although it's still slated, I mean, 14,

44:43.760 --> 44:49.580
or we should say 11, two, because it's basically the 11 characters with their names changed.

44:49.580 --> 44:53.280
So they could very well, instead of saying the falsy and lussy or whatever, they could

44:53.280 --> 44:57.400
be like, they're the, we're just going to go back to espers.

44:57.400 --> 45:03.720
They're espers now, or they're summons or they're, um, I don't know, let's make up another

45:03.720 --> 45:04.720
name for summons.

45:04.720 --> 45:07.320
Well, they could just, it's final fantasy blank.

45:07.320 --> 45:10.320
They could think of a name for it, you know, just like there was final fantasy tactics.

45:10.320 --> 45:14.240
It wasn't really a final fantasy game, but kind of in that universe, it was a great game.

45:14.240 --> 45:15.380
Was that kind of a name?

45:15.380 --> 45:16.680
So I don't know.

45:16.680 --> 45:22.520
And you can't count 13, two really as a game in the, I mean, because then you'd have to

45:22.520 --> 45:26.040
count 10, two, and then you'd have to count dirge of Cerberus and it throws everything

45:26.040 --> 45:27.040
off.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.040
So you can't do that.

45:28.040 --> 45:33.280
Those are all spin-offs, but I guess we're going to have a definitive answer come what

45:33.280 --> 45:37.440
September 1st, because there's supposed to be some Tokyo game show at least by then.

45:37.440 --> 45:40.120
Well, square's doing some type of final fantasy.

45:40.120 --> 45:45.820
Like they even said, what is next in the final fantasy 13 universe on September 1st.

45:45.820 --> 45:55.600
And so either that's versus has a new name or it's, or all of this is proven false because

45:55.600 --> 45:57.360
again, it is a rumor.

45:57.360 --> 46:01.740
I mean it, you know, it's not like everything Kotaku's ever said has turned out to be true.

46:01.740 --> 46:04.240
Think about it.

46:04.240 --> 46:07.880
And there's also a possibility and a lot of people are saying, well, what else could they

46:07.880 --> 46:08.880
do?

46:08.880 --> 46:14.760
But final fantasy 13, three, wouldn't that be something?

46:14.760 --> 46:22.360
Which is weird because if it's true that there's a final fantasy 13, three, which would make

46:22.360 --> 46:23.360
a lot of sense.

46:23.360 --> 46:25.000
I think 13 do did pretty good.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.920
It probably wasn't as expensive to make because they made it on the same engine.

46:28.920 --> 46:32.120
They had all that DLC for it, which I'm sure made them money too.

46:32.120 --> 46:35.360
13, three actually makes a lot of sense for them to do.

46:35.360 --> 46:42.660
But it's weird because final fantasy 13 was supposed to be three separate games.

46:42.660 --> 46:48.560
And now final fantasy 13 might, if these theories prove to end up being three games that are

46:48.560 --> 46:51.600
all just one, two, three, final fantasy 13, one, two, three.

46:51.600 --> 46:55.360
It's kind of weird how it transformed like that.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.240
Alan?

46:58.240 --> 47:02.200
And I think the reason why a lot of people are invested in this story is for those who

47:02.200 --> 47:05.200
don't follow Square Enix that closely.

47:05.200 --> 47:10.400
The crew that like the director and the main crew who did the Kingdom Hearts console games

47:10.400 --> 47:15.420
have been working on 13 versus 13 for however five, six years.

47:15.420 --> 47:21.600
So for it to become vaporware maybe would piss a lot of people off because depending

47:21.600 --> 47:25.880
on how tinfoil hat you want to get, the Kingdom Hearts console team has been working on it.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.960
So they need to have a product out so they can work on the next Kingdom Hearts.

47:28.960 --> 47:32.400
I just can't see Square just throwing it away.

47:32.400 --> 47:37.900
I could see where Square has decided Kingdom Hearts three needs to happen now.

47:37.900 --> 47:41.520
And so maybe they have maybe they've said, you know what, guys, you've had this game

47:41.520 --> 47:43.400
for two F and long.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.360
So we're taking it away from you and giving it to this other team.

47:46.360 --> 47:49.880
And we're going to put it out under a new name and you guys go work on Kingdom Hearts

47:49.880 --> 47:50.880
three.

47:50.880 --> 47:55.280
I mean, anything is possible in that regard, but just for them to throw away six years

47:55.280 --> 47:56.520
worth of work.

47:56.520 --> 48:00.580
If you think about everybody's salary that gets paid for that, that's millions of dollars

48:00.580 --> 48:01.580
they're throwing away.

48:01.580 --> 48:02.580
If they do that.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.580
And I highly doubt they're going to be thrown away.

48:03.580 --> 48:06.840
A lot of final fantasy games before remember all that stuff that grin was working on, they

48:06.840 --> 48:10.640
were working on a final fantasy game and that, but that was grin.

48:10.640 --> 48:15.040
That wasn't, you know, I understand that, but they, they're not beyond throwing.

48:15.040 --> 48:19.060
Although some things that they should really throw out 14, um, they just don't and they

48:19.060 --> 48:20.060
hold on.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.060
That's the other thing.

48:21.060 --> 48:25.520
Maybe final, maybe they're realizing they need to rush 15 because 14, they need to erase

48:25.520 --> 48:29.120
14 basically, which is still getting relaunched.

48:29.120 --> 48:35.120
Well, I've also saw speculation that the reason why there's no press release saying yes versus

48:35.120 --> 48:38.960
13, this is what's happened to it, whether it be canceled or whatever is because their

48:38.960 --> 48:43.240
last year fiscally was so bad because of 14 shedding the bed that they're just not putting

48:43.240 --> 48:47.420
out negative press releases anymore because of damage control from 14.

48:47.420 --> 48:52.920
But that's kind of, I don't, that's a thought, um, I don't want to drag this out too long,

48:52.920 --> 48:53.920
much longer.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.680
I want to get to the next story, but I do want to kind of throw this idea out there

48:56.680 --> 49:00.620
because somebody on Facebook had said this and I was like, Hmm, that's a good point.

49:00.620 --> 49:07.480
Is that, well, if they canceled final fantasy 13 verses, why did they just release the theme

49:07.480 --> 49:09.800
song for theater rhythm?

49:09.800 --> 49:13.120
Because theater rhythm has that song as a downloadable song.

49:13.120 --> 49:18.240
So why would they release that if they just canceled the game and tease this final fantasy

49:18.240 --> 49:19.960
13 verses?

49:19.960 --> 49:23.180
Of course, this could be the case of Square Enix being a giant company.

49:23.180 --> 49:28.480
The left hand hasn't told the right hand theater rhythm DLC team what's going on, but I thought

49:28.480 --> 49:30.720
it was an interesting point.

49:30.720 --> 49:36.400
So, all right, let's move on to another story.

49:36.400 --> 49:40.900
This is about the Xbox 360 and something that's developing on the 360, but we didn't hear

49:40.900 --> 49:44.680
anything about it at E3, but this totally seems like the type of thing they would have

49:44.680 --> 49:47.680
announced, but I guess they didn't.

49:47.680 --> 49:51.280
It's something called Avatar fame stars.

49:51.280 --> 49:55.640
Now a trademark for the game had turned up earlier in the year, but now we're starting

49:55.640 --> 50:01.960
to see this actually appear in games, such as Wreck-A-Tear, not to be confused with the

50:01.960 --> 50:03.760
game that's on Steam.

50:03.760 --> 50:07.400
This is Wreck, like Wreck-It Ralph, Wreck-A-Tear.

50:07.400 --> 50:14.240
It is part of Microsoft Summer of Arcade series, and it is including this Avatar fame stars.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
What is this?

50:15.240 --> 50:20.060
Quote, Avatar fame stars is a new program for Microsoft Studios and is part of a select

50:20.060 --> 50:24.840
group of games that delivers new and exciting ways to play online with your friends and

50:24.840 --> 50:29.400
compete for social recognition, according to Microsoft.

50:29.400 --> 50:36.640
I guess this is supposed to include in-game challenges, and this sounds kind of like rebranding

50:36.640 --> 50:43.040
of shit that's already been there, because if you do these challenges, or I thought achievements,

50:43.040 --> 50:48.760
in these Avatar fame star games, you get rewards based on your fame star points.

50:48.760 --> 50:51.080
Oh, so like rewards for my avatar.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.800
Doesn't that technology already exist on the 360?

50:53.800 --> 50:58.920
Like I could swear that if you play, like, Super Meat Boy, you get a t-shirt, or Minecraft,

50:58.920 --> 51:01.120
and there's tons of that type of stuff in games.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.680
So I'm trying to figure out, like, what is this?

51:03.680 --> 51:07.680
But I guess what they're doing is instead of it being game by game by game, this is

51:07.680 --> 51:10.020
one gigantic pool.

51:10.020 --> 51:14.760
So like, you know, if a game is participating in this pool, then you, you know, get the

51:14.760 --> 51:19.240
points and the achievement points towards a common unlock.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.920
That's like the difference, which is a little weird, but that's how it works.

51:22.920 --> 51:28.520
So the rewards cross from game to game, as does the points total.

51:28.520 --> 51:32.360
Avatar fame stars is locked to your Xbox 360.

51:32.360 --> 51:37.240
They're saying it's possible this is something that could spill over to Windows 8, Surface

51:37.240 --> 51:40.040
tablets, Windows phones, who knows.

51:40.040 --> 51:45.980
Other games that will include Avatar fame star support, Full House Poker, World of Kieflings,

51:45.980 --> 51:50.760
so games that already exist, it's gonna be kind of patched in, Fire Pro Wrestling, Home

51:50.760 --> 51:54.360
Run stars, Avatar, Motocross, Madness.

51:54.360 --> 51:57.700
We don't know when the already existing games will have it patched in or when all these

51:57.700 --> 52:03.320
other games are coming out, but I guess if you're into collecting Avatar awards, there

52:03.320 --> 52:06.520
you go.

52:06.520 --> 52:10.280
I don't know about you guys, but pretty much every Avatar on my friends list is all wearing

52:10.280 --> 52:12.500
Mass Effect garb.

52:12.500 --> 52:13.500
Not me, though.

52:13.500 --> 52:15.600
I actually tried to make my Avatar look like me.

52:15.600 --> 52:23.360
I was a sucker and I spent like 120 Microsoft points to get a stupid hat for my Avatar that

52:23.360 --> 52:29.480
looks like a hat I would wear out to a club, because I am a sucker.

52:29.480 --> 52:34.240
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

52:34.240 --> 52:38.760
So Valve is always trying to do great and interesting things with Steam.

52:38.760 --> 52:42.680
It's a gaming store and application.

52:42.680 --> 52:47.960
They brought Steam to Mac and Apple platforms, and they also invented Steam Play, which is

52:47.960 --> 52:52.040
where if you buy a license for one game on PC, you get it for Mac and vice versa, and

52:52.040 --> 52:55.160
now they're bringing Steam to Linux.

52:55.160 --> 52:57.420
So there's gonna be a Steam client for Linux.

52:57.420 --> 53:05.780
They are using the Ubuntu distribution, and for people who aren't familiar with Linux,

53:05.780 --> 53:11.880
there's different revisions of it based on which company wrote that build of it, and

53:11.880 --> 53:16.080
there's Red Hat and Corel and Ubuntu.

53:16.080 --> 53:21.000
So yeah, that's what they're going for, because it's sort of the popular make of it right

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
now.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.120
And the first game that they're porting to, their first party title that they're bringing

53:27.120 --> 53:32.240
to Steam Linux is Left 4 Dead 2.

53:32.240 --> 53:38.800
And they've been working on it since last year, 2011, and I guess there will be an internal

53:38.800 --> 53:41.620
beta of Steam on Ubuntu in the near future.

53:41.620 --> 53:47.240
So they've announced that it is coming soon, and Left 4 Dead 2 is the first title they're

53:47.240 --> 53:48.680
bringing to it.

53:48.680 --> 53:53.960
If other developers want to port their games over to Linux, this Valve is making the distribution

53:53.960 --> 53:54.960
model for it.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.920
You ran a Linux box for a while, didn't you?

53:57.920 --> 53:58.920
Kind of, yeah.

53:58.920 --> 53:59.920
I had a FreeBSD box.

53:59.920 --> 54:04.040
That was a long time ago, back when I was trying to host my own domain name and be a

54:04.040 --> 54:05.640
super nerd.

54:05.640 --> 54:06.640
Let me ask this question.

54:06.640 --> 54:08.400
I'm gonna take it back a huge step here.

54:08.400 --> 54:11.240
I'm gonna want to ask this question, because I seriously think a lot of people don't know

54:11.240 --> 54:12.240
the answer to this.

54:12.240 --> 54:18.040
And I think sometimes the hardcore computer people, super nerds, don't realize that a

54:18.040 --> 54:21.320
lot of people don't get this, or maybe they do, I don't know.

54:21.320 --> 54:25.520
But why would someone want to have a Linux machine?

54:25.520 --> 54:28.000
What does Linux do for you that Windows doesn't?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Uptime.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
A well-made Linux install.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.780
You just have your computer on all the time.

54:35.780 --> 54:39.500
You don't lose any performance.

54:39.500 --> 54:42.900
You can put...

54:42.900 --> 54:46.080
The terminology, I haven't touched this stuff in, seriously, like ten years.

54:46.080 --> 54:47.200
But it's not...

54:47.200 --> 54:52.360
When people think Linux or Unix, they think of sort of like MS-DOS prompt, like just a

54:52.360 --> 54:53.560
text terminal.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.600
But that's not the case.

54:55.600 --> 55:03.640
Linux has visual Windows-ish interfaces now.

55:03.640 --> 55:08.220
If you're into independent software, like really independent, Linux has got a huge community.

55:08.220 --> 55:12.840
People making apps for each other, I don't know, it's just all about the...

55:12.840 --> 55:16.200
If you do have a good internet connection, you wanna host your own email, host your own

55:16.200 --> 55:21.960
domain names, host your own web server, blah, blah, blah, you're gonna be running some flavor

55:21.960 --> 55:25.520
of Linux on that box, if you wanna do all that in-house.

55:25.520 --> 55:29.160
Look at all these nerds in our chat room, and I say that lovingly.

55:29.160 --> 55:33.360
Black Wolf says, I've had a free BSD server up for over 1,000 days.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.360
Uptime.

55:34.360 --> 55:35.360
Uptime.

55:35.360 --> 55:40.120
My home box was up for 400 days until I rebooted it recently.

55:40.120 --> 55:44.760
Tiger Claw says Linux is commonly used to run servers, especially for online games.

55:44.760 --> 55:48.400
Game Guru says Linux is generally more secure than Windows.

55:48.400 --> 55:50.500
Is that though because just less people use it?

55:50.500 --> 55:56.000
It's kinda like the whole, well, Apple never gets hacked, because there's less people on

55:56.000 --> 55:57.920
those systems than there are on...

55:57.920 --> 56:02.680
Well, there was a problem in the early 2000s where certain distributions of Linux, if you

56:02.680 --> 56:07.020
just put it on a machine, would have its email relay turned on by default.

56:07.020 --> 56:10.160
So if someone found your IP address, they could just spam the shit out of everybody

56:10.160 --> 56:12.900
using your server, and you would never know.

56:12.900 --> 56:19.480
So if you don't know what you're doing, people can do nasty things on your Linux box.

56:19.480 --> 56:25.680
But then that's your problem, it's you being an idiot, not the software being built flawed.

56:25.680 --> 56:30.920
Well Technus says, I like Linux, I hate the elitist community that comes with it.

56:30.920 --> 56:39.000
Yeah, FreeBSD versus Linux, or just the StarBSD versus StarLinux, that's some Star Wars Star

56:39.000 --> 56:40.000
Trek shit.

56:40.000 --> 56:47.200
Like, there's Switchblades, and people get shivved in alleyways, it's very brutal.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.480
So Steam on Linux, do you think that would be well received by the community?

56:50.480 --> 56:53.000
Or do you think it'll be like, ugh, commercialism?

56:53.000 --> 56:59.680
Well, they would have to run, if they really wanted to play Windows games on Linux, they

56:59.680 --> 57:04.640
would have to do, I think, it's called Wine, which is kind of like, I think, Bootcamp.

57:04.640 --> 57:08.440
A lot of people on the internet wine very well.

57:08.440 --> 57:12.720
It's like Bootcamp or Parallels, I think, on Mac, where you can run Windows through

57:12.720 --> 57:13.720
it.

57:13.720 --> 57:19.120
So if people wanted to play PC games, but they just, I don't want a PC box in my house,

57:19.120 --> 57:24.440
I don't want a partition of a hard drive, god damn it, this will allow them to do that,

57:24.440 --> 57:26.960
for at least for Left 4 Dead 2.

57:26.960 --> 57:29.520
Anything else, if they don't want to have a Windows box or a Windows partition, they're

57:29.520 --> 57:32.640
going to have to mess with it.

57:32.640 --> 57:37.800
Alright, BlackWolf says very clearly, Wine is not an emulator, it basically implements

57:37.800 --> 57:39.440
the Windows DLLs on Linux.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.440
Okay.

57:40.440 --> 57:41.440
Alright.

57:41.440 --> 57:42.440
It's a little correction.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
Yep.

57:43.440 --> 57:45.520
Because remember, Linux, elitist, right Bobby?

57:45.520 --> 57:48.080
I'm just, I'm giving him a hard time.

57:48.080 --> 57:52.320
Alright, GameGrew says Left 4 Dead 2 is a good choice, it's a rather complex source

57:52.320 --> 57:53.320
game.

57:53.320 --> 57:55.760
That's true, if you can get that on there, then that opens the door to a lot of other

57:55.760 --> 57:56.760
games.

57:56.760 --> 58:02.480
I want to go on to the next story, Loki, I want to, Wine actually stands for Wine is

58:02.480 --> 58:03.480
not an emulator.

58:03.480 --> 58:06.040
Yeah, I think I actually knew that, but I'm so far removed.

58:06.040 --> 58:07.720
10 years, just saying old age.

58:07.720 --> 58:08.720
Yeah.

58:08.720 --> 58:09.720
Alright.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.240
I want to go back to a comment that came up in chat earlier, because this is a very important

58:12.240 --> 58:15.200
clarification to something I had brought up a minute ago.

58:15.200 --> 58:21.680
Ospher in our chatroom says, for the Theatrhythm DLC for Somnus from Final Fantasy Versus 13,

58:21.680 --> 58:28.160
it labels the song as just from the Final Fantasy series, but not which one.

58:28.160 --> 58:31.680
Maybe that's a sign of the name change that they don't want to reveal yet.

58:31.680 --> 58:36.640
That is huge, that is a big deal, I think that's worth stating, so thank you for saying

58:36.640 --> 58:37.640
that, Ospher.

58:37.640 --> 58:42.400
I think that is, if they didn't label it as Versus 13, then yes, a name change is coming,

58:42.400 --> 58:44.400
or question mark, question mark.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.400
I think you're right.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.400
Very interesting.

58:47.400 --> 58:49.120
Alright, back to news, sorry, Loki.

58:49.120 --> 58:56.840
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about Fez, and Fez had an issue with one of its

58:56.840 --> 59:03.760
recent patches, where not a lot of people, but some people were having issues with their

59:03.760 --> 59:11.960
save games being obliterated, and of course, because of that, Polytron pulled back the

59:11.960 --> 59:20.120
patch that they put out, and they were gonna release a second patch to fix that problem,

59:20.120 --> 59:27.280
however they said no, because it was gonna cost them $10,000 to get the game recertified

59:27.280 --> 59:33.840
by Microsoft, and so they're just saying, well, you know, if any players have an issue

59:33.840 --> 59:41.800
with the game, your save's being deleted since you're only like 1%, kinda tough luck, you're

59:41.800 --> 59:45.480
just gonna have to deal with it.

59:45.480 --> 59:50.520
So of course, they made the comment, you know, had Fez been released on Steam, we wouldn't

59:50.520 --> 59:54.160
have this issue, because updates are free.

59:54.160 --> 01:00:01.080
But I believe the designer of Fez said it's not a PC game, didn't want it on PCs, so...

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.240
Exactly.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.440
And then they said no, well, does that mean a Steam version is in progress?

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.480
Only a few months left for Xbox Live Arcade exclusivity, they said.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:18.400
Microsoft of course responded, saying, you know, that Polytron and their investors, Trapdoor,

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:22.520
made the decision not to work on an additional title update for Fez.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.800
Microsoft Studios chose to support this decision based on the belief that Polytron slash Trapdoor

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.840
were in the best position to determine what the acceptable quality level for their game

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.040
is.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:38.000
And while we do not disclose the cost of title updates, we do offer, we did offer to work

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.240
with Trapdoor and make sure that wasn't a blocking issue.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.860
We remain a huge fan of Fez.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:50.280
So I don't know if that means, okay, we're not gonna charge you 10,000, but we'll charge

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.280
you 7,500.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.280
Discount!

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280
Discount.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.000
I mean, I don't really know what these issues...

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.360
Apparently Microsoft patches are available in the Steam sale.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.360
But here's my thing.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.440
I mean, it's problems, first off, you know, it is closed system, so Microsoft can charge

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.440
you whatever the hell you want.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.280
But when you make your game, you're well aware of what those costs are gonna be before you

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.600
make your game.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.680
And they probably thought, okay, well that's no problem, we're not gonna have an issue

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.680
with this stuff.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:20.980
But then some bugs went through, and so they released a patch, which obviously they did

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:22.480
not test well enough.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.140
And if it's only having the 1% of the people at the time, see, I don't understand how a

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:31.180
save game problem can only be having the 1% of the people, because that's, you're basically

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.500
running on systems that are all the same.

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.360
You know, I don't understand how it can affect one and not the other.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.760
But whatever.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.860
So they released a patch that they didn't test well enough, and now they're complaining

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:48.320
that they would have to pay more money out of their pocket to, you know, fix the game.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.440
And I understand that this developer is not as big as, like, Activision, who releases

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.560
like 13 goddamn patches for Call of Duty, and...

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.280
But they were in Indie Movie the Game, surely they must be, er, Indie Game the Movie.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.280
Wow.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:05.920
They were in Indie Game the Movie, surely they must be rich.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:11.560
Well, I don't know if that's the case, but, you know, maybe $10,000 is too much.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.240
Maybe they're kind of like opportunity cost, we can either fix it for the 1%, but are we

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:19.320
really gonna recruit this money in additional sales, or do we just leave it as it is, and

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.520
hopefully it doesn't affect that many more people, and we'll just, you know, keep the

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520
money where we're at.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.260
I think that's kind of where they're at, is that they didn't want to spend the money.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.000
It's a tricky issue though, because like on one hand I'm like, wow, that's kind of fucked

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.360
up of Microsoft to charge so much money, but on the other hand I'm like, well it also really

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:36.920
encourages people to get it right the first time, so you can't blame them.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:43.340
As it is, games are patched left and right anyways, and, um, you know, I think that it's

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.260
a good thing that they do charge that kind of money, because it does discourage them

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:49.760
from like going, well fuck it, we didn't really test this game, so we're just gonna release

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.720
it out there, we'll see what kind of bugs people run into, and then we'll go fix it.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:56.120
I should be able to get a refund when their game is buggy as hell.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.600
Although, granted, it's only affecting less than one, or whatever it is, 1% of people,

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.600
but if I'm in that 1%, I should be able to get my money back, don't you think?

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.160
You'd have to make the argument with Microsoft.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.520
Welcome to the world of digital distribution.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.400
Yeah.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.760
They just take customer service right on out of the picture.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.520
But to be fair, it's not necessarily Microsoft's fault that that game doesn't work.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.400
It's just being hosted on their servers, it's the developer and publisher that decided,

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.280
hey, we don't want to pay money to fix this game, so you're gonna have to go ask them

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280
for your money back.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.720
Yeah, but it's on their system, it's only on their system, they kind of own it a little

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.720
bit too.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.720
You know?

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.720
I mean, whether they want to or not.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.720
But it's not their fault, though.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720
I know.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:51.640
That's like saying, you know, oh, that game is, you know, this game is buggy, and just

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.640
because it happens to be on Xbox 360, I'm gonna blame Microsoft for it.

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:58.960
It doesn't make any sense, because they're just providing the system that it runs on.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.880
Their system's not causing the problem.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.520
At least I don't think it is.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.560
All right, well, let's move on to a different topic that apparently is causing a big problem

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:12.760
in the iPad world, or iOS.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:15.400
But this particularly is for the iPad.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:21.060
And Alan, I'm pretty happy that Maruko in Sanrio, your cats, aren't into playing games

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.060
on my iPad.

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:23.060
Because apparently...

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.060
They're too old.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.060
They don't care.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.060
They don't care anymore.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:30.400
Well, apparently, there is an iPad app out there called Games for Cats.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.040
It's an iPad game that is actually aimed at cats, you know, for them to, like, paw at

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:36.040
the iPad.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.920
I would be worried about them scratching it up, but I guess it doesn't...

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.400
Yeah, I'm incredibly against decline cats, because they actually remove, like, it's part

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.400
of the bone.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.400
Yeah.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.400
So you're taking off, like, half their finger.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.800
So I think that's wrong.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.120
But if you don't have a declawed cat, why is it pawing at your iPad?

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.760
It costs, like, $800.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760
What is wrong with you?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.720
I don't think the glass scratches that easy from cats scratching it.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.960
I mean, like, my cat scratches our LCD TV, and...

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.880
I wouldn't want to take that chance, because I look at the sofa, and I'm like...

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.960
Well, that's the sofa.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.440
That's where, you know, you've got material where the cat's claws are getting caught in.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.440
Cats have already...

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.840
The cats have already fucked up the bed.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.840
I don't even...

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.840
Yeah, but we're talking glass.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:19.280
We're talking glass that's meant to, you know, withstand, you know, quite a few scuffs.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:23.640
You know, obviously dropping it on something, or scraping it on something sharp, you know,

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:24.640
might cause a scratch.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.640
But it's...

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.720
The cat claws aren't strong enough to cause a lot of scratches.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.880
And there's folks in the chat saying they...

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.760
Bobby Blackwolf says their claws don't scratch the screen.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:34.760
They've tested.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760
Plus...

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.760
I hear that.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.760
I just don't believe it.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.760
Plus the bottom of their feet.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.800
The bottom of their feet are nice and soft.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:43.040
So whatever scratches they put in there, they buff right out.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
So it's fun.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:48.400
Yeah, when a cat bats at something playfully, it doesn't have its claws out, but when it's

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.720
trying to scratch, like when it's trying to fuck up a chair, it's trying to clean its

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720
claws on it.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720
So yes, its claws are out.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.760
But it's not going to do that on an iPad.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.720
Unless they really hate Macs, or, you know, Apple.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.040
Well anyway, which maybe Sanrio hates Apple.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.560
I don't want her scratching the iPad.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:11.320
But anyway, all seriousness, back to the article.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.320
Games for Cats.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.480
It is an iPad game.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.800
It's, you know, of course, for cats.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.960
It, like everything else in the Apple world these days, has DLC.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960
Double dippin'.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.960
Right?

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.960
Charge you up front and then, hey, you want more levels for your cats?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.940
Ninety-nine cents for a new mouse level.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.940
What a surprise.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.840
But here's the real surprise.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.640
Cats bought it.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:42.900
Apparently, there's this epidemic where cats are inadvertently buying the DLC.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:49.640
And people are complaining that the design of the game fooled cats into buying it on

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640
purpose.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.040
Yeah, because there's probably some little mouse that says, buy more on it, that runs

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040
across the screen.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:59.480
And then the next one is, yes to check out.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.760
And that's it.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.800
You know, real hard stuff to code around.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.080
I thought that they had to put in passwords in order to get that stuff purchased.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.240
You can save those, apparently.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.960
Because I can't do that on my iPod.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.960
I have to, you know.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:17.560
No, you can save your password, so it never prompts you for that stuff.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.480
Well, then it's the fault of the owner.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:20.480
Well.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.160
And because you're buying games for your cat.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.120
Have you thought that maybe, you know, that's like a stupid thing?

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:30.920
I'm gonna whip out my multi-hundred dollar device here so my cat can...

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.520
Why is it stupid?

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.960
We let our cats watch the TV.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.240
We, you know, why is it stupid?

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.280
That's like, okay, this is basically like saying, hey, you know what, my cat likes the

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.800
outdoors, I'm gonna buy it a car so it can drive down the street because it fucking likes

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:45.800
the outdoors.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.800
Tootsies is real.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:52.720
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that I can see someone having a little

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:57.280
swipe, you know, a little game visually for the cat on an iPad.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280
That's fine.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280
I can believe that.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.800
What I can't believe is someone going, hmm, Mittens was really into that game a week ago,

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.040
but now she just doesn't care.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.600
I think she needs the DLC.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:12.200
I think she needs a new, a new, a new, a new stage for her to be interested in again.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.200
Yeah.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.080
No cats don't give a shit, right?

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:21.120
I'm going to, yeah, for 99 cents you can get a shoestring and that will entertain your

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120
cat forever.

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.320
The cat's not going to go, I already know how to chase the mouse on this maze.

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320
I need a new maze.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.640
She's just, I don't, she's not going to play anymore.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.940
These are cats that still chase laser pointers, even though like, you know, years and years

01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:37.220
and years of chasing it, they know they can't catch the fucking light, but they will still

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:41.000
chase it because they're fucking stupid and they're like, I got to get that light.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I got to get the light.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
The light's delicious.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.760
Eat the light, light, light, chase the light, light.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.760
I'm going to get it.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760
The light light.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:49.760
I got it.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760
I got it.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.760
Oh damn it.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.760
It's on my paw.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760
Got it.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760
Oh, so close.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760
Got it.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.760
Light light.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760
Where'd it go?

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:58.760
Where'd it go?

01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.760
Where'd it go?

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.760
Where'd it go?

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.760
Where'd it go?

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.760
That can also be a dog too, by the way.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:03.760
Dogs do that.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.060
I used to love that cause like I'd played with the laser pointer with my dog and you'd see

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.320
her just like twitching out for like an hour afterwards.

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:12.160
Just like, what, what, what, what, what they're coming for me.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.160
Wait, wait.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160
I put it right there.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160
Where is it?

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160
All right.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.460
Uh, to answer the folks in chat hiccup is the company behind this game and an artist

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:33.200
named TJ fuller, who did the artwork in games for cats said, quote, we got in a lot of trouble.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:38.660
So they have implemented a human check to fix the issue.

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:45.260
You have to hold four fingers on touch points without moving them for a few seconds because

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:50.560
the cat would never have that type of attention span to hold in four spots for a few seconds.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:58.080
Unless it's standing on top of the iPad.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.600
So just like you have to monitor your children when they're playing with the iPad, maybe

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.900
you should monitor your cat because let's be real.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.120
You're not buying the app on the iPad for the cat's enjoyment.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.400
You're buying it for yours to watch the cat play it.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:19.680
Are you really get the cat away from you so they would stop bothering.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:23.440
Rama and chat says, this all reminds me of the Smurfs village fiasco.

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.480
Yes, Rama.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480
But those were children.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.480
This is a cat.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480
It doesn't matter.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.760
They still have like 13 year olds.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.720
I didn't know that those Microsoft purchases were real money.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.720
Right.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.720
You didn't know that.

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720
Sure.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:43.360
Well, my, my fireworks are going, well, now you know who, what's the name of the really

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.840
he's really old, uh, he's got the sunglasses, the fashion designer, Margaret show had a

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.840
bit about him.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.440
Um, Carl Lagerfeld.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.520
Yes.

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.880
His cat has a personal assistant and a Twitter and its own iPad.

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.320
So let's put that out there.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.080
Carl Lagerfeld's cat has its own iPad.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:09.720
So that maybe that could be, you know, what have you done with your life?

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.720
So that story, this story reminded me of that.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Yeah.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.720
That's a real thing.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.920
What would you put on your resume?

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:18.540
I, yeah, I w I was a personal assistant to this cat.

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.040
That was my last, the cat fired me because I

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:35.040
Toon says, the cat who could drive a car, he drives around all over the town, toon says,

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.040
the cat who could drive a car.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.040
Don't just look at it.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.040
Let's be real.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:50.040
Toon says did a good thing by making sure Victoria Jackson was in that car.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.580
Agree.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:53.980
And poor Phil Hartman.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.980
Poor Phil Hartman.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:57.680
Rest in peace.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:03.220
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio on vognetwork.com.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.040
Use the passphrase kitten.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.860
All right.

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.860
Let's move on.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:08.860
Allen.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:09.860
Excuse me.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.500
I'm eating popcorn.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.900
So uh, what's going on?

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:23.880
Sony is shutting down the online servers for two of its motor storm muddy truck games.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.320
Specifically its motor storm pacific rift, which came out in 2008.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.640
So that is four years old.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.000
And its PSP counterpart, motor storm arctic edge.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.720
So if you like to connect to PSN and do races, co-op or whatever with the matching service,

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.240
that is all going away.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.880
As of, I think, October 1st.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:49.680
It's the last day, or I guess September 30th is the last day you have to enjoy that.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.680
October 1st.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.280
I'll give you a heads up.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.280
That was nice.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.160
Is there any of these games, online pass games or we know that's, we're not here.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.400
I didn't even get into it when I was bitching about mass effect three, by the way, I didn't

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:05.120
even get into the online pass thing and how my $10 isn't paying for shit, but anyway,

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.800
I'll just let that argument right itself, boys and girls, I just want to throw that

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.520
out there, but I guess, yeah, it's a really short story.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.180
That's that's really it.

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:21.160
Motorstorm Pacific Rift and Motorstorm Arctic Edge, which is a PSP title, losing its Sony

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.640
provided network while the machines are molding over anyway, so that one's not so bad, you

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640
know.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:31.280
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.880
games we can buy that will have their servers shut down in 2015.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.040
Well, I don't know if any of these games are going to have their servers shut down, but

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.320
there is not really much coming out this week because it's kind of falling along the lines

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.360
of July, the month with no game releases.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.620
But this week we do have, if you're feeling, you know, that you got to get in shape to

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:58.160
wear a bikini, you know, maybe not this year because you've procrastinated too long.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:06.120
But for next year, they've got the Adidas My Coach for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 move

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120
in.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.120
There's tons of preorders for that.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.520
Move and connect.

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.880
That's coming out this week.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:18.080
Just on 3DS, you know, because there's actually people that were born well after that game

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.580
came out.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:23.880
And Prototype 2 on PC finally making its way out.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:28.400
That was quite delayed.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:33.760
And then also I guess they have a move essential bundle for the PlayStation 3 with Just Dance

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.240
3 thrown in there.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.120
All right.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.860
So that's it.

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.240
Going to Japan this week in Japan.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:48.560
A couple more releases in Japan, but not a lot, but I know this one is extremely popular.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.200
Came up on the show a couple weeks ago.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.680
Persona 4, the ultimate in Mayanaka Arena, although remember that's the one that's region

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.520
locked on PlayStation 3.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.800
It's also available on Xbox 360, which was always region locked.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.840
But that is out in Japan this week on July the 26th.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.840
Alice Madness Returns gets a price reduction on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:14.360
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Multi-Raid 2 HD version.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.160
That tells me this is a remake HD version.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:20.600
This is a remake of a title that was already out there.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.960
Trying to see if this is a game I recognize from here.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.860
It looks like, looks kind of like a Dynasty Warriors-esque game, but I don't think that's

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:29.860
what it is.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.340
But like, you know, combo points and all that stuff.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:35.580
But it's HD version.

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:41.120
Also coming out this week, the Super Dimension Fortress Macross Hybrid Pack, which I believe

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.780
would mean it's the game and the Blu-ray making its way out in Japan this week.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:48.120
That's the 360 on the PlayStation 3.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.840
Let's take a look at the Vita real quick.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.200
Nothing really of note on the Vita this week.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.760
Some accessories, a new AC adapter, but that's not that exciting.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:03.180
So lastly on the 3DS this week, Cave Story 3D makes its way to Japan this week, as does

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.720
a new pen in cobalt blue.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:06.720
Ooh-ah.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.720
That does it for Japanese releases.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.720
Alan, UK.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:15.680
UK and Europe, Prototype 2 on PC is coming out July 24th.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:23.000
July 25th, we have Wizorb, which I would recommend very much if you're into 16-bit retro sort

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
of games.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.960
It's 2D, but it's an RPG Arkanoid Breakout mashup game.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.940
So it's got the Super NES graphics, and you're a little wizard playing Breakout, and it's

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:32.940
really fun.

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:33.940
You can have that on Steam.

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:34.940
It's cute.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:35.940
Yeah.

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.200
It's also, check out the Steam sale before it goes away, because I got it a couple days

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.520
ago for like three bucks.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.120
And on the indie games for Xbox if you don't have that.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.120
Oh, nice.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.120
Yeah.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:49.960
So that's specifically on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PSP.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.760
Wizorb also on July 25th, Recettear, which is the game we were talking about earlier.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:01.720
July 27th, we have Inversion on PC, and Pokemon Conquest on DS, and then finally for this

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:09.680
week on July 28th, Freaky Forms Deluxe Your Creations Alive, which is a very silly name.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.880
I don't know what that is.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.760
All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get into the classic game of

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:16.760
the week.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.040
Dark Soccer may not be here to give a classic game out, but Salacious Pop will fill in,

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.300
and we'll figure out what he picked in just a minute.

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.800
For now, Loki.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.920
So this is kind of interesting.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.280
You may remember a few years ago, there was a class, I mean, there's always class action

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.480
lawsuits when it comes to Madden and NCAA, but there's one that actually went to court,

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.760
and they finally settled.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:45.520
So EA has reached a settlement in a class action lawsuit that started in 2008 for $27

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.840
million.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:54.280
Also part of that, they will not be able to renew their exclusive agreement with the NCAA,

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.600
assuming that the court upholds that.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:04.800
And then of course, you know, because of that, those who were affected by it, who purchased

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:18.200
a EA Sports NCAA game, will be entitled to anywhere from $6.79 per game on the GameCube,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.960
Xbox and Playstation 2, and $1.95 for the Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.560
And they're saying that also, EA has agreed to the stipulation on future license agreements

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.680
as part of the proposed settlement.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.840
They will not make any exclusive licensing deals with the AFL for five years, and they

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:40.040
will not renew their current agreement with the NCAA, and also they won't be able to enter

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:46.120
another exclusive licensing agreement with the NCAA for five years.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:51.080
And the exclusive, I guess, well the trademarks for like the NFL and stuff are not affected

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:55.000
by it because this is only the NCAA, but it's still interesting.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.400
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't follow sports titles as closely, you know, I think that's

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.360
pretty obvious if you've listened to the show for a while, but obviously these are huge

01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.360
money games.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.240
I know EA's had a lot of, they've taken a lot of shit for their exclusive agreements

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.280
in the past.

01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:11.000
This kind of seems like a big deal here.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.120
I mean, granted, the refunds that people get aren't that big a deal, although I heard that

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:22.560
whatever people don't claim will go to child's play, which, that's great, but I'm talking

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.320
more about the future, about how future licensing agreements work, that seems like it might

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
be a big deal.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.480
Well, all it's going to mean is that they're not going to be exclusive, so they're still,

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.600
I mean, this doesn't mean the NCAA football is going away anytime soon, it just means

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.720
that there could be a version from 2K.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.160
That's huge, in my opinion, if 2K could do those.

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:46.040
Well, I mean, remember they did all, was it, all pro football or something like that, it's

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.160
sucked.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:53.800
Well, it sucked because it didn't have those licenses, so it didn't have as big of a budget.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.520
But it sucked as just a game, though.

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:00.120
I mean, not to say they couldn't pull something out, but I don't know.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:06.160
Then the other thing, too, is that this has to, they have to wait on approval from the

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.440
court, which is going to happen on September 27th, so this is all, right now, the settlement,

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:15.320
but the court has to say, okay, we agreed it, you know, the settlement's fine.

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:17.240
So we'll just have to see what happens there.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:21.000
And we should say, again, the NFL trademark is not, it does not affect it.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.720
No, this does not affect Madden at all, so, um, but I just think it's funny, though, is

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.920
that arena football is also, I mean, they haven't had an arena football game in forever.

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:32.200
Although, I didn't remember, they did try that for a while, they had an arena football

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.580
game for like two years.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.920
What about the XFL game?

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:36.920
I'm just kidding.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:37.920
Hold on.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:38.920
Remember the XFL?

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920
Hold on.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:40.920
That was hilarious.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.120
You laugh, you laugh right now, but you know what league is considering a game, actually?

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.640
Not necessarily EA publishing it, but there is a game coming for this league.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640
Uh oh.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.000
The Lingerie Football League.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Fuck yeah.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.560
I'm telling you, that's a real thing.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.400
I might play that.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.400
That sounds awesome.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.080
You know the problem with those Lingerie Football Leagues and stuff like that?

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:13.600
It's, I mean, the people watch it because they're hoping that, like, a top gets ripped

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.600
off.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:15.600
It never fucking happens.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.720
So, cause, so that's my problem, it's not adult enough, you know?

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.160
We need an adult game.

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:24.400
I need an adult.

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.280
There's only so much plausible deniability on why you're watching it before it's like,

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.080
I could have looked at so much porn in the time that I've been watching this.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:33.080
I'm watching-

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.480
Like, I'm just gonna take it that next step further.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.320
I'm watching this because I think they play really good football.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.400
No, no one's believing that.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.960
Yeah, so you're reading it for the articles.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960
Yes, of course.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.200
I'm watching this for the articles.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.920
You know, you know what would make, you know, getting away from, you know, sexy women for

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:48.920
a minute, you know what?

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.040
They should license into a game.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040
Puppy Bowl.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
Yep.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040
They've already done that because-

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.040
Get out.

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.040
No, no, it's not Puppy Bowl.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.480
But remember, there was, um, the, god, who was it?

01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:00.840
It wasn't Joe Montana.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.560
It was Jerry Rice Dog Football.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:08.680
It came out on the Wii last year, about a year ago, actually, because I remember-

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.680
Okay.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.360
Well, the problem is that was Joe Montana, who's kind of, you know, he's long-

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360
It's Jerry Rice.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360
Oh, sorry.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:20.960
Well, Jerry Rice also kind of, you know, it's, it's not that hot ass ref that they had on

01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.680
the Puppy Bowl the past couple years.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.680
Not this year.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.680
And really, you know why I failed?

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:26.680
No kit in halftime.

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.680
So that-

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:28.680
Good point.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.680
Good point.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.760
Yeah, that night, his dog football was the, uh, game.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:37.280
The talk about, you know, chicks and football and all this has me thinking about one of

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.360
my good friends, and, you know, I follow her on Facebook and all this.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.280
She's getting really into roller derby lately.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.400
Are there any good roller derby experiences on consoles?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:50.960
You know, I want to say, I thought there was a roller derby game, but, uh, probably not.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.080
I don't think there is a roller derby game.

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.080
Which is sad.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.520
I mean, perhaps-

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.400
There's quite a roller derby audience, though.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:59.280
She's got like a trading card and everything.

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.280
Perhaps.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.280
Pretty cool.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.240
You know, they will come out with one because, um, you know, there was, uh, there's been

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:16.320
plenty of games for, like, um, what was it, uh, uh, for lacrosse and, like, for rugby

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.960
and that kind of stuff, so maybe we'll see that.

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.920
Um, I am seeing, though, there is, uh, yeah, Jam City Roller Girls was actually a game

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.120
that came out.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.120
Oh, okay.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.480
Um, it was on, I think, the Wii?

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:36.240
Stan in our chat room says, you mean Asuka, who was, um, you know, she was the girl that

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.000
was on the tester who was on the show about, what, six months ago at this point?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.840
Um, I follow her on Twitter, but not Facebook, and I forgot, she does roller derby, too,

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.840
that's right.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.200
No, this is a different friend I'm thinking of, but-

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.200
Yes, WiiWare.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:53.920
It was on WiiWare, Jam City Roller Girls is, it is an authentic, um, well, I don't know

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:59.200
how authentic, but it is a roller derby game, so, uh, they do have one.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.680
All right.

01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:01.680
There's one.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.920
Which is, you know, they should have more than one.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:04.920
It looks decent.

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.320
All right, let me move on.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.320
I gotta go to this.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.320
This is-

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:16.200
Oh, God, I just, I'm just gonna put this out there, and Alan, I'll wait for you to make

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.360
some smart-ass comments so you get ready, okay?

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:23.840
I don't even really want to plug the website by saying its name, but I'm gonna have to

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:28.280
too, so I want to just preface this by saying I ain't endorsing this shit, I just have to

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.800
report on how ludicrous it is, all right?

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:36.200
Um, there is a new website out there, and it's basically, from what it sounds like,

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:39.600
it's kind of like adult friend finder, but for gamers.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:43.040
And it's called Shagga Gamer.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.600
It's launched in the United Kingdom.

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.600
Sorry.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.600
Really?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.600
That's-

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.600
Sorry, yes.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.320
I can't imagine that's in the United Kingdom with it being called Shagga Gamer, because

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.960
I don't believe anybody uses the phrase Shag.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.480
Yes, they do.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.240
Every time they see Austin Powers, they want to see Shagga Gamer.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:01.680
Yes, Austin Powers, featuring a British spy.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.440
Yeah, baby!

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:11.960
Wow, that's current, that's some current stuff there, current material you got working there.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:18.880
Austin Powers, a franchise that hasn't been around for years now.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.680
It is what they're calling the number one adult site for gamers.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.480
Of course they're calling it, yeah, we're number one.

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.600
Well, who's their competition?

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:29.600
Exactly.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.440
Who cares, I mean-

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:38.640
They're offering their services to thousands of single gamers who want nothing more than

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.240
a quick shag.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.120
Yeah, baby.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:50.800
For just 19.99 pounds a month, you get full access, this is a quote, quote, full access

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:58.160
to young, old, exciting, sexy individuals wanting no strings sex.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.640
They're apparently coming soon as a Shagga Gamer TV as well.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:09.520
No, no, I do want to say, and this is important in their quote, they do not mention female

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.520
gamers.

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:13.840
She needs to be all dudes.

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.600
So technically, yes, there are young, old gamers that want to have sex with no strings

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.920
attached, but they're all dudes.

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:29.720
The site continues, quote, quite simply, we are the best at matchmaking thousands of gamers.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.240
We are the same people behind Data Gamer, and we are the UK's biggest destination for

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:37.300
single gamers and geeks.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:43.000
So when users are looking for a site to find the hottest gamer girls or the biggest number

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.320
of gamers, that's why we are many people's number one choice.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:54.360
Now, it should be said that you can follow Shagga Gamer on Twitter, and out of all those

01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:03.080
thousands of people that are hooking up, they have 56 followers on their Twitter.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:08.280
I believe the OLR Twitter has something like 700 or 800 followers.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.480
So would it be fair to say that if suddenly we said, you know what, we don't want to be

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.680
just an internet radio show anymore.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.260
We want to be a place for casual gamers to find a fuck.

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:21.520
We would be able to say now we are the number one company.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.040
So suck it, Shagga Gamer.

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.040
There's a problem with that.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.640
I don't give a fuck, so.

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.680
Alan?

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.120
This just makes me curious as to how many hookups happen at like E3 or PAX.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.640
Like do people get laid at those cons?

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.640
I'm sure that PAX.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:38.640
Oh, sure they do.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:43.040
PAX, they actually, there's been articles where people will post Craigslist articles

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.700
or notifications, it's a meetup for an orgy, basically, at PAX, and they will do that.

01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:51.160
So yes, they do that.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:55.400
And anime cons, and I mean there's a lot of like geek sex going on, but.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:57.800
Anything with a furry crossover, then yes, obviously.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:58.800
Dragon Con?

01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.800
Yeah.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800
I mean, but.

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.520
Why do you think all the guys from VoG are going?

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.160
I don't mean stuff that's set up like that on Craigslist, but just, oh hey, I see you

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:09.160
at the Nintendogs.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.280
Oh, I'm in that hotel too.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280
Room four?

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:13.280
I got some wine.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:19.080
You know, they have a phrase for a reason, you know, a fool is money, you're easily parted.

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.700
Don't be a sucker.

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.960
Obviously there are not sites like this that are, there's just tons of hot gamer girls

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.740
just waiting around for someone to just fuck them.

01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:33.640
Why aren't there any guys who the fuck me me misses attractive gaming loving girl with

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.640
big titties?

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.400
I'm sorry, that does not exist anywhere.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.200
So what, you know, all these sites that want to charge you money and stuff like that.

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:47.320
Like for example, there's a perfect, what was it, remember the gaming one where you

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:52.200
would join up and you'd play, you play games with hot gaming girls and stuff like that,

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:58.640
and they would, you know, have video cam time with you and, um, they may undress somewhat

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.120
when you're playing the old battleship or something.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.200
I don't know, Alan, I might shag that gamer.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:11.760
That image on their splash page is hilarious because I can't tell if it's just a really

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:17.120
cheap stock image photo that they just photoshopped those shaggy gamer thing on his shirt or if

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.120
that's an actual photo shoot.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.120
No, cause she has it too.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.120
She has it too.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:21.120
Yeah, I could shop that.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:22.120
That would be hard.

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.520
That's a photo shoot that they had about as hard as that might be right there.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:28.520
What am I pointing at?

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.520
Ellen?

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:30.520
I know.

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:31.520
Look how well defined that is.

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.520
She's, she's lifting his shirt.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.520
Yeah.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.360
I think that's a photo shot at his junk, I guess, but you don't need to lift his shirts.

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.840
I don't know what's going on in that picture, but then they show some of the actual users

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:47.240
of the site and like, you know, Paula 25 she's waiting to get shagged.

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:48.560
I'm sorry.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.560
Okay.

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:55.880
Here's my question though.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:58.000
What is so gamer about this?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.640
I mean, is it like, you know, you want someone to fuck and then cuddle and play Skyrim with

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:08.520
after, like, can't you just go on OkCupid and set gamer tags as your match?

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.320
Like only show me people that have this filter.

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.320
That's what I'm thinking.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.320
Yes, exactly.

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.320
You can do that.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:18.720
Or there's even if you're looking to date somebody, there's even that geek to geek site,

01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.240
which I hear is okay.

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.300
But you're better off, you know, with something like, you know, like an OkCupid or plenty

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:30.380
of fish or something like that, where it doesn't really cost you anything to do it because

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.280
these sites, they basically, oh yeah, it's free to sign up, free to sign up.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:37.440
And then you sign up and then you're like, oh, I want to talk to this person.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.000
I want to send them a message saying, yes, I would like to fuck you.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.680
That's going to cost you money.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:44.240
You're not a premium member.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.680
And then you become a premium member.

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.080
So, uh, sorry, you're not blah, blah, blah.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.840
You need more money to do this.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.840
They put it this way.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:53.840
You know what?

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.280
These people that they have, the models that they have here are not on their fucking site.

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280
Okay.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280
Well, you know what they might do?

01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.120
I bet, and I bet a lot of websites like this do this.

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:03.720
They probably partner with another site.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:06.000
Like the women probably didn't sign up for the site.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.860
The women signed up for some other site and the women signed up for a site that was like,

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:14.080
find a nerdy guy or find a rich guy or something like that.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.320
Cause you know, all nerds are rich like, and I bet that's what it is.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:23.080
They do something to lure the women in and there's something really tiny, really tiny

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:28.280
in the terms of agreement that is, Oh, your picture and profile may show up on our partner

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.880
websites.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:35.500
So some of these women probably sign up for, you know, just, you know, fuck me and leave

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.960
me.com or whatever.

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.360
I don't know.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.720
And suddenly they're on Shagga gamer.

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.720
I don't know.

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.720
All right.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:47.160
I think we spent far too much time on this topic.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.160
Yeah.

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.160
Just don't give them your time.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.880
I mean, that's basically the moral of the story.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.680
Go to Craigslist, but be careful.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.880
Like there's some real freaky people on Craigslist.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:04.240
Craigslist is just weird.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.400
Let's go to a time when games were a lot simpler.

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:18.280
Back when we were innocent and we weren't thinking about such pervert things, the classic

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:24.240
game of the week, every week, dark Sakura goes into the vault and finds a classic game

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.760
that she deems worthy of you to revisit all over again.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:36.440
But since she's at a wedding, Alan's here and he dug into the shoebox to find the classic

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.440
game that he thinks you all should play this week.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:44.320
Alan was the classic game of the week, classic game of the week is a Lucas arts game on the

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.760
scum engine came out in 1993.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.680
It is maniac mansion day of the tentacle.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:50.680
Good pick.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.720
Got any audio for me?

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:56.280
I'm getting some up right now.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:02.480
Oh, this amazing intro.

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:08.360
So yes, this is the sequel to a previous classic game of the week, maniac mansion, which came

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:09.980
out in 1987.

01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:15.240
You play Bernard, who was one of the cast members of the first game.

01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:24.000
You are called back to the mansion by totally blanking on his name, Dr. Fred, because the

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.440
purple tentacle has drank some toxic sludge that made him super smart and he's going to

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:35.120
take over the world, so you and your two friends have to go back in time to prevent him from

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:39.440
drinking the slime and becoming super smart, but something goes horribly wrong with the

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:47.880
time machines that are made out of porta potties, they're modified porta potties.

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:57.880
Listen to the audio.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:05.240
The main directors of this game were Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman, who had worked on the adventures

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:10.500
of monkey island games, and they got their pedigree from that and Lucas Arts said, okay,

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:14.280
you guys are going to helm this game and it's the sequel to maniac mansion.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:19.200
It's point and click style.

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:23.940
They fixed the engine that they used in this for Sam and Max Hit the Road, which was the

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:30.440
other game I was debating using tonight, but yeah, so you've got give, pick up, use, push,

01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:34.420
look at, open, and you just click that, you click on your verb and then you click on what

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:37.000
you want and you interact with the puzzles that way.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:43.560
Bernard stays in present day, his sort of overweight rocker friend, very hair metal.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:49.000
Hoagie goes into the future and then she's kind of a Daria Morgendorfer, Ally Sheedy

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.820
in the Breakfast Club, kind of spazzy girl.

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:58.280
She goes back in time to the colonial ages, or do I have that backwards, I forget.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.280
She goes to the future, Hoagie goes to the past, that's right, sorry, I haven't played

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.980
this game in years, but it's super awesome.

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:10.480
They went and looked at a bunch of Warner Brothers cartoons for the visual, like how

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.240
they wanted to do the art direction, and also a lot of the sound effects are taken directly

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.480
from the cartoons as well.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.560
And yeah, it's got Thomas Jefferson and George Washington are some of the cameos that Hoagie

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:30.420
has to deal with in the past, and it has a great endgame when it all comes together and

01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:34.480
all the three characters are joined again, it's just a lot of fun.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.000
This game also was one of the first few CD games, for one it was a computer game that

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.440
came out on CD-ROM and also had full voice acting, which at the time, I think, King's

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:50.300
Quest V, the Sierra game which came out I think in 91 also had voice acting, but a lot

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.680
of it was really bad.

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:58.080
The voice acting in these LucasArts games, even though for the early 90s, are phenomenal.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.000
Amazing voice acting considering that it was new technology, because when this came out

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.160
on PC and PC were just getting talky video games, we were playing the Super Nintendo

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.960
for about a year or two, because that came out in 91 to just show the timeline of how

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:14.060
the technology was.

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:21.220
But yeah, I actually installed, I still have this, I have the original instruction booklet

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:25.600
and the disc, and I installed DOSBox on my Windows 7 machine so I could play this in

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.600
Sam & Max.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:30.440
Does this come on LucasArts' pack that's on Steam?

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.000
Good old games has it, I want to say.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't know about Steam.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.160
I remember there was some type of LucasArts mega pack of adventure games it was on, that's

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.440
how you could get Loom and shit.

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:47.480
And for people who are into emulators, DOSBox is just, you still need the game with DOSBox,

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:51.920
but if you have SCUM, SCUM is also an emulator specifically for LucasArts games that run

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:52.920
on this engine.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:56.480
ActDeft clarifies, nope, it isn't on Steam at all.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.000
So it is not a part of that pack, go figure.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.960
Also some other comments on this game, Burr says, Day of the Tentacle is the best adventure

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.600
game ever.

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:10.080
Dungeon Buster says, this was LucasArts at the height of Awesome 2.

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.200
This and Sam & Max, I don't want to try to put one over the other, but both of those

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:21.640
games together are just phenomenal adventure games for that era of PC gaming.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.360
Anything else you want to say about Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle?

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:27.360
Uh, hilarious.

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.520
One of the funniest games they've ever played aside from Beavis and Butthead Virtual Stupidity,

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.000
which I'm sorry, my judge wrote the script, it's a hilarious game.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.520
You'll have to pick that next time.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:49.480
And I want to say, I'm trying to find the actual site for this rumor, but I think it

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:57.640
might be Telltale Games, but someone somewhere wants to put out an episodic franchise that

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:01.240
exists in the same universe that references Day of the Tentacle.

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.300
I could see that, because as much as people loved this game, nothing ever really came

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.300
after it, you know?

01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.640
Yeah, no, Maniac Mansion 3, do you think we'd get?

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:13.040
Well, LucasArts has been all about, literally, Star Wars games, for what?

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.360
Pretty much since, once this era ended, they've just been about Star Wars, really.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.480
And Grim Fandango was their last big splash in PC adventure games.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.960
But yeah, super awesome, people should check it out.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:29.560
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Maniac Mansion 2, Day of the Tentacle,

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.880
or just Day of the Tentacle for short.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.240
Thank you, Alan, good pick.

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.280
A good PC adventure game.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.160
Alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys, we have plenty more

01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:44.800
show when we come back, including rapid fire news, and we're gonna revisit Xbox security

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.800
again.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:48.880
But this time, it might not be as much ranting as it's been in the past.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:59.640
We'll find out when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:05.720
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on Sunday, July the 22nd of 2012,

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.600
with episode number 466 of our show.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.080
DarkSakura, not here tonight, she is at a wedding in Las Vegas, the wedding of Tiara

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:20.240
and Dan from Geek-Life.com, and we want to, once again, wish them a very happy wedding.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:25.040
I see the pictures are starting to show up on Facebook, and all I can say is, aw.

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:32.080
Alright, I promised a giveaway here in part B, and again, this is a code generously donated

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.960
to the show by Bashka, and you can visit his website, critcraft.blogspot.com, if you like

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.120
World of Warcraft stuff.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.360
Even if you don't, he tends to have some, you know, some other little gaming things

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.080
that sneak in there, too, and the types of stuff that a lot of OLR people, I bet, would

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.840
be really into.

01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.760
What we are giving away, once again, it is a beta key for Ravaged.

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:58.440
This is, I can play this little gameplay trailer here that he sent me there on the Facebooks.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.760
I guess there's some gameplay in this trailer here.

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:07.120
It's a first-person shooter that is set in a world ravaged by a polar shift pitting scavengers

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:14.200
versus the resistance, so as soon as this ad finishes playing, I'll play a little clip

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.680
of the gameplay trailer, and we're going to give this away right now to somebody that

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:23.880
is checked in at vognetwork.com and in our chat room, and of course, wants the code,

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.200
because I'm going to send them a private message and be like, are you going to use this code?

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:32.200
And if they, uh, they don't, then I'll give away to somebody else.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.200
I remember this one.

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.200
Yeah, it looks like a lot.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:38.200
This is the game that was supposed to be like Rage, you know, how Rage is supposed to be.

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:41.800
It's, you know, like fighting and bugging.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:46.160
Lots of like, do-buggies, planes, that type of stuff.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.280
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.880
Might want a pretty decent computer in order to play this.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.280
All right, let's see who we're going to give that away to.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.240
We're going to do this live right now.

01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.940
What I'm doing right now, I'm pulling up the list of people that are currently checked

01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.440
into the show.

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:08.120
All right, so I need you, Loki, you checked in.

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:09.320
Are you trying to win this too?

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.320
No, I'm just checking all the time.

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.760
All right, pick a number between one and 30.

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:17.160
Uh, Alan, pick a number between one and 30.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.160
23.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:19.160
23.

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.160
So that's 31-39-87-6543.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:29.200
I want to see if that person is in chat right now.

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.200
Hopefully they have a similar name or I might not be able to identify them.

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.800
I think you can just Google a random number generator and put in the one to 30.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:38.120
It's more fun if I ask you.

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:44.560
Uh, I'm looking, I don't see that person in chat right now.

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.040
Looking one more time.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.360
Just making sure.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.960
Okay, yeah, that person isn't in chat right now.

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:52.960
So give me another number.

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.960
12.

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:54.960
12.

01:41:54.960 --> 01:42:00.680
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:03.440
I'm pretty sure this person is in chat.

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:04.720
It's Raginator.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:09.080
Let me see if he wants it.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:16.400
Okay, I'll let you guys know in a minute if Raginator is going to take the code or if

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.880
somebody else will walk away with it.

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.160
So I just sent him a private message.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.520
All right, let's move on in the meantime to rapid fire news.

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:25.520
Loki.

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.520
All right.

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:31.120
So, um, as I mentioned, I was playing a game called, uh, you know, I want to be the guy

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.160
Gaiden, uh, that's finally been released now, so you can check it out.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.200
It's a little buggy.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:41.420
It's just the first of a few episodic games that are going to be put out, but I mean,

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:44.240
it's pretty hard, so it'll have to do.

01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:50.600
It's three levels long and you can check it out on, um, GameJolt has it, uh, so just go

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:55.560
to GameJolt.com and look in their freeware section and they've got, you know, I want

01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.160
to be the guy Gaiden.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.560
It's pretty easy to find.

01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:06.940
Or you can go to, uh, Kaylin's, uh, or can site, uh, K A Y I N dot P Y O K O, uh, dot

01:43:06.940 --> 01:43:12.480
org slash I W B T G. I want to be the guy.

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:13.800
So there you go.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.320
You can find all the information on that and it's pretty cool.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:17.600
So check it out.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.480
Um, this is kind of funny.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.880
You know, the game, uh, Tokyo jungle, the one that's basically a bunch of animals surviving

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.680
in a post-apocalyptic Tokyo.

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:27.160
It looked awesome.

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.160
It looked awesome.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.680
Well, they're even making it a little, uh, stranger.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:36.640
They're adding Japanese businessmen to the game.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:43.680
There's DLC that's, uh, coming out that you can play as a salary man and you can, uh,

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.160
well, businessman can be pretty Savage too.

01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.160
Let's be real.

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:51.360
So you can play the game and God, I hope you don't have to mate them.

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:52.360
That's going to be weird.

01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:55.400
Uh, but yes, so I'll be coming out.

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.200
I'm looking forward to the game when it finally makes it over here.

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.720
Uh, act deft and chat says, isn't it being localized for the U S yes, yes it is.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:03.720
It is.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:07.760
Uh, Ray dear at a live.vog network.com says, I want to be the guy.

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760
Damn it.

01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:12.920
I'm sure that's what a lot of people say playing that game.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:19.080
And then finally Manos, the hands of fate is coming out on iOS.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:25.120
They're making an eight bit type game for it and it is a 2d platform or it's a very

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.940
retro and maybe we'll be on other platforms other than iOS at some point, but of course

01:44:30.940 --> 01:44:35.960
has all the, you know, infamous stuff from the series.

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:39.840
And if you're not familiar with Manos stands of fate, but it's one of the worst movies

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:44.160
ever made, you know, how bad is it?

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.160
It's pretty bad.

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.680
I've fallen asleep twice with trying to watch it once, uh, both times with, uh, mr.

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680
Sand, Seager 3000.

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680
Oh wow.

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.680
And it was still bad.

01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:55.200
It was still so bad that I fell asleep.

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:59.400
All right, well, let's move on to some other stories.

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.240
First up, rock band blitz finally has a release date.

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.960
Uh, they said it would come out this summer and we're already about halfway through summer.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:12.600
Well, we finally have a date for at PlayStation, August 28th, X-Box live, uh, a day later,

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:19.040
August 29th, that's going to cost you 15 bucks for this game and some more songs were revealed

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.040
for the game.

01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.040
We'll, that will be in the game.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:25.920
Cool and the gang's jungle boogie, my chemical romances sing funds.

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:26.920
We are young.

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:32.040
And that's like the song that won't go away off the radio at all, um, Avenged Sevenfold

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.820
so far away also there.

01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:35.840
And a lot of people very excited about this.

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.800
It uses all the DLC from rock band that you might have built up on your hard drive.

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:43.840
And if you're like me, you have a lot.

01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.560
So it's pretty cool that you'll be able to use this in the game as well.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:48.960
Very cool.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:55.320
Uh, now, uh, Portal 2, if you've beaten Portal 2, then the joke, I'm in space, makes sense

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.320
to you.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.520
If not, welp, sorry, I'm not going to spoil you, you'll just have to go back and beat

01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.520
it.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:03.160
But what's kind of funny is that things are about to get really meta because NASA is going

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.920
to send Portal 2 to space.

01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.920
That's right.

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:13.080
An anonymous tech at NASA laser engraved the space core on a part that is going to be flying

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.560
on a resupply craft to the International Space Station.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.040
Valve posted about it on their official Portal blog on Friday.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.960
Uh, they don't know who did it.

01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:24.160
It was an anonymous tech at NASA.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:29.900
NASA did not endorse this, but it's happening because they actually laser engraved this

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:33.520
little Wheatley in space.

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.520
It's not Wheatley, it's a core.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.200
Yeah, it's a space core.

01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:38.920
It's the one that's in the Skyrim thing.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:39.920
Space.

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920
Space.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.920
Space.

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.920
Space.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920
Space.

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.920
What is that Wheatley at the end of the game?

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920
He eventually went in the space.

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.920
Oh, okay.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.240
He was all emo about it.

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.240
All right, whatever.

01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:50.240
Oh, that's right.

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:51.240
Okay.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.240
Yeah, right.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:53.240
I'm okay.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:54.240
Yeah.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:55.240
Wheatley's emo about it.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.240
And then there's the other guy in the background.

01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.240
Yeah.

01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:58.240
Yeah.

01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.240
Yeah.

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:00.240
It's been a little while since I beat Portal 2.

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.240
I beat it when it first came out.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.240
So anyhow.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:03.240
And if you're going to kill me because I gave a little spoiler there, you know what?

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.680
Game's been out a year and it's been on sale for like five bucks lately.

01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.760
So I'm thinking you haven't played it at this point.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:15.600
Um, also lastly, uh, EA gets a lot of hate.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.560
But they did something that's pretty cool this week.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:23.280
Um, they joined Microsoft, Viacom, Google, Zynga, another company gets a lot of hate,

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:25.720
and eBay on this that's pretty cool.

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:31.660
It is a amicus brief that declares opposition to DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, which

01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:34.820
legally defines marriage between a man and a woman.

01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:39.380
And EA in a press release said, quote, DOMA presents a number of problems for businesses

01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:45.020
like EA as it creates regulatory tax and discrimination complications for employers.

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.840
And that's why we're standing against it.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:51.240
The underlying lawsuit impacts all employers, no matter how big or small, and no matter

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.240
the industry.

01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.480
And we encourage other businesses to join these efforts.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:56.480
And that's pretty cool.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.960
EA's, um, been pretty supportive of LGBT causes in the past.

01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:04.000
They actually marched in the Pride Parade in San Francisco and in Seattle.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.840
They've done their own It Gets Better campaign video that's available on YouTube as well.

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:13.860
So a little less evil doing the right thing and standing against DOMA, which obviously

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:17.580
we here at OLR also think is kind of crap.

01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:22.720
So let's move on with some more stories.

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:29.520
The Los Angeles comedy club Laugh Factory, which is world famous, I think the first stand-up

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:36.060
comedian that ever performed there was Richard Pryor, Dave Chappelle, and has done like six

01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.240
hour sets there.

01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:38.840
So yes, world famous.

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:41.720
They have a charity to help kids and all this stuff.

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:48.840
They are coming out with a streaming channel for PS3 on PlayStation Network, PS3 only from

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:49.840
this story.

01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.560
$3 a month if you're a stand-up comedy nerd like myself and you listen to stand-up comic

01:48:54.560 --> 01:49:00.040
podcasts like Greg Proops and Aisha Tyler like I do, you might like this.

01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:05.400
I know stand-up comedy isn't really as relevant now as it was in the 90s, but yeah, Laugh

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:09.040
Factory, Los Angeles Club, $3 a month.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.520
Both pre-recorded and live performances from stand-ups.

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:18.440
No real schedule yet on the content, but if you're a comedy nerd, you've got $3 a month

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.440
to burn.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.440
It's kind of neat.

01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:21.440
Something different.

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.440
Yeah.

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:25.080
Although you can get it for free through some of those other podcasts you mentioned.

01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.080
Yeah.

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:27.080
Well that's, yeah.

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:34.360
And then also the Dreamcast classic Jet Set Radio, very funky, amazing cell shaded game

01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:43.480
is coming to iOS and Android this summer to compliment the PC and Vita versions.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:49.280
So I remember the Dreamcast one, the original, and it was an amazing game.

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.420
It eventually got too hard for me to like, I think by the time I unlocked the fourth

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:56.880
or fifth character, it just got so hard I couldn't do it anymore.

01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:04.120
The learning curve for the controls was when you got it, you got it, but it took a while.

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.720
I cannot imagine how this is going to play on a touch screen unless they really tweak

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:09.720
the controls.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:16.760
But yeah, funky Jet Set Radio goodness coming to your phones this summer.

01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:17.760
All right.

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:21.520
Before we get into the Fugu question of the week, guess what, Raginator never responded,

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:23.160
meaning he's not there.

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.160
And I seem to recall he said his PC is kind of challenged anyway, so I am regretfully

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:30.240
going to have to pass the code to somebody else.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.680
So once again, I need a number between one and 30.

01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.960
Uh, hold on.

01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:36.960
What are you looking?

01:50:36.960 --> 01:50:37.960
No, don't.

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:38.960
Just say something.

01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:39.960
Don't Google it.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:40.960
17.

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:41.960
17.

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:42.960
All right.

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.960
So if Raginator was 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:46.960
All right.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.680
I know that person's in chat and I know he'll respond.

01:50:49.680 --> 01:51:01.240
That is VX Jason XV is number 17 to check in tonight.

01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:08.360
Hold on by me, by me a little time here, guys, while I send Jason a private message.

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:09.360
Does he PC game?

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:11.560
Cause he might be like, Hey, PC games.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:13.560
I think he does.

01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:15.080
Yeah, he does.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:16.080
So all right.

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:20.280
Now I will give Jason like five minutes to respond and if he doesn't respond either,

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.200
then we'll move on to somebody else.

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.200
All right.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:24.200
All right.

01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:29.000
Uh, we're going to get into the Fugu question of the week here.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:33.800
Every week we ask you guys a question on our Facebook and our Google plus, put them together

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:36.280
and you get Fugu.

01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:38.320
I don't have the music queued up this week.

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.320
Sorry.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:43.880
But, um, we read some, some of the responses here on the air.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:46.800
I don't think we'll get through all of them.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:50.920
There was a lot of responses tonight and there's no way I'm going to be able to read all of

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:51.920
these.

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:55.760
Please, please check out our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orange launch radio

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:57.340
and our Google plus.

01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:00.160
There's a few responses over there too, believe it or not.

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.560
Uh, I, I don't have a URL for it.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.960
One one zero nine four.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.960
No, I'm just kidding.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960
I'm not going to read the whole thing.

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.360
Just go to Google plus and search for orange launch radio.

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:08.720
You'll find us there.

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:11.080
Here's the question of the week.

01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:15.880
Kind of a tricky question because obviously there was a lot of really tough stuff that

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:17.200
happened over the weekend.

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.200
You know, just a lot of really unfortunate events.

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:27.280
And when tragedy like this happens, unfortunately people like to point the finger at video games.

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.280
And so I wanted to ask this question to our Facebook and Google communities and that is

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.280
sometimes when tragedy happens, commentators on big news channels are quick to blame video

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:40.240
games for a person being so deranged.

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:45.280
What if anything can we do as a gaming community to stop this reputation and show that there

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:50.040
are far more good people playing video games than bad?

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:55.400
You know, because when that incident happened in Aurora, you know, over the weekend, which

01:52:55.400 --> 01:53:01.120
was terrible, they splash that guy all over the news as the news tends to do, which is

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:05.240
really unfortunate because they're just making him famous by doing that, which I hate.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:09.500
But you know, it should be the victims we should be remembering, but anyhow, they always

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:13.960
bring these commentators on because everybody wants to know, why do you do it?

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:14.960
Why do you do it?

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:15.960
What was going on in his head?

01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:18.400
He was a quiet kid and he went crazy.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:19.400
Why do you do it?

01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.400
Why do you do it?

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:25.360
And somebody always inevitably says video games, you know, which is ridiculous.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.360
Yeah.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:29.880
The problem with the video game, blame video games is it's as common now to be playing

01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.540
video games as the watch TV.

01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:33.200
So you can blame TV now too.

01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:37.600
Well, I mean, or you could, it was that rock music he was listening to, it was those comics

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.600
he was reading.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.500
It was, you know, the TV he was watching is the movies he's watching.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:48.200
It was the drugs and some people blame Batman because he said when he got arrested or whatever

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.880
that he was the joker.

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:52.200
You know, it was the goddamn Batman.

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:56.240
You know who, you know, who is to blame him.

01:53:56.240 --> 01:53:58.120
That's it.

01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:02.720
There was a fake article that circulated on Tumblr the night that it happened saying that

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:07.740
he was arrested in like joker cosplay for, and which of course is full of shit.

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:08.740
Not true.

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:14.560
But it's like, why are people photoshopping fake newspapers to troll like literally an

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:17.320
hour after it happened saying that he was dressed as the joker?

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:21.960
Well, something about, I mean, again, I don't like talking about him, but I will entertain

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:26.160
that something about he, there was a picture of him with crazy hair that was on the internet.

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:30.720
Again, anything could be photoshopped, I guess, but well, it was on his, uh, adult friend

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:31.720
finder.

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.280
Oh, it's those sexual deviants.

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.280
All right.

01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:35.880
Look, no, it was him.

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:37.200
It was his fault.

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.200
He did it.

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.200
I mean, whatever.

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.720
Anyway, two words.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.720
Fuck him.

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:43.720
All right.

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:44.720
Let's get to though.

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:47.640
How do we keep the bad reputation off of gamers?

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:50.960
Because there's far more good people playing video games than there are bad.

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.080
Let me go to some of the answers on Facebook.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:54.360
Read the haze starts us off.

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:59.480
The first thing we should do is not get online and attack the people who blame video games

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:01.440
because it just proves them right.

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:02.880
Think before you act.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.480
We need to bring ourselves out there and show our positive side and drown out the negative

01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:08.480
noise.

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:12.960
Make a YouTube video or write up on how we are productive members of society.

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:14.880
Just don't be an asshole on the internet.

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.760
It's as simple as that.

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:20.920
Or don't watch those news programs because they're sensationalists to get people to watch

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.920
them.

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:27.080
Ronnie B says, usually it's the news media, so I'd ask them how is their constant coverage

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.680
endorsement of graphic stories 24-7 any less likely to drive someone mad than a video game?

01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:36.960
Even if the results of a tragic event is inspired by a video game, what can you do when the

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:38.600
person is a grown adult?

01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:42.880
There is already the ESRB in the US, so I don't think you can really blame video games

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:45.560
anymore, and I think that's the best argument.

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:46.560
You know, that's true.

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:50.840
A lot of people are driven to this sort of insanity because they think it's going to

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.960
make them famous, and I guess in some ways it does.

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.440
And I'm always reminded of this.

01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.360
In Sacramento, we had a really unfortunate case where a guy shot people at a Jack in

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.360
the Box.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:07.800
I mean, just, you know, another just crazy asshole goes into a store and shoots people.

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.120
And part of the reason he did it was he said, I want to be famous.

01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:14.420
I know I'm going to be plastered all over the news.

01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:15.420
I'm going to be famous.

01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:16.420
I'm going to be the most famous.

01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:18.360
And like, he said that.

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:26.040
Well, in this interesting, ironic twist, that all happened on September 10th, 2001.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:30.200
So he wasn't famous for very long because the media hopped right onto something else.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.240
Well, he got his 15 minutes.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.400
I mean, and it's just like, I'm not trying to be funny.

01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:40.920
It's just this really hugely ironic thing, and it just kind of points out, I mean, God,

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:44.200
I hate using that word in conjunction with such tragedy, but you guys know, you know

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.520
what I'm getting at.

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:52.200
It's that he, you know, was driven by fame.

01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.200
Attention whores.

01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200
That's what they are.

01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:55.200
Yes, right here.

01:56:55.200 --> 01:57:01.360
Um, let's see, uh, Clover N. Responds saying, promote all the charities connected to video

01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:02.360
gaming.

01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:05.200
I said, vampire says nothing.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:10.580
It's a waste of time trying to educate our tar to scapegoat.

01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:11.580
They do it on purpose.

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:14.080
They do it on purpose because it's a sensational thing.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:15.240
It gets viewers.

01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:17.040
That's all in the end of the day.

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:19.640
That's all the news programs want is they want more viewers.

01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:23.380
So whether that means recording or, you know, covering the news story first or covering

01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:27.080
the most in centralized way, that's really what it is.

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:32.000
They want viewership, so they get paid, add money, the end.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.280
Why not 18 is nine responds and says, parents, it's not the only solution, but a start on

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.160
knowing what your kids are playing.

01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:43.360
If there's a problem with the kid's brain, then a video game might be the start of stifling

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.360
the problem.

01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:45.360
I could be wrong though.

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.920
Great show guys.

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:54.880
Um, Pika Uno says, as someone who works in the media, I can say it's not our, the gamers

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:56.280
parentheses fault.

01:57:56.280 --> 01:58:00.680
The news is now an entertainment show and entertainment shows need a running narrative.

01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.220
It's so much easier to just give the public what they want, an obvious scapegoat rather

01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:08.680
than to think about how the news itself is propagating this.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:13.320
If you're really interested in how TV really works from an insider's point of view, I urge

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:19.020
you to watch Charlie Brooker's screen wipe, news wipe, and games wipe on YouTube.

01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:23.480
Very interesting comment from Pika Uno, kind of from the inside.

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:27.280
Last one from Facebook, Cody T says, what we could do to get the media and other people

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.520
blaming video games to understand that these people that act out in a violent way are not

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.920
doing so because of video games, movies, et cetera.

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:37.880
It has a lot to do with the thoughts they had from the time they were born.

01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:39.560
Some people to me are just bad apples.

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:43.640
It has nothing to do with video games, movies, or any kind of medium like that.

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:48.340
It's just easy for the media to pick an outside cause to what was actually in this person's

01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.020
mind their whole life.

01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:55.200
So in conclusion, there is no good or even great way to get media to stop blaming it

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.760
on video games because media is media.

01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:04.980
And at the end of the day, true gamers know that it is not true.

01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:05.980
Complicated issue.

01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:07.060
Before I go to Google, Alan?

01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:12.760
With all the, you know, with Chris Hardwick's franchise Nerdist and all this stuff, the

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:17.160
progress that gamers have made with like PAX and just crossing into the mainstream and

01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:25.880
being more of an accessible thing for, you know, it's not as niche as it once was.

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:30.660
But the reality is that it's still considered for the people like ages 45 and older who

01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:34.160
watch the news, who get really, you know, into this stuff.

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.320
It's still a part of the counterculture, I guess.

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:39.380
It's still something that a lot of people can't relate to.

01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:42.880
That makes it a magnet like Loki was saying about the sensationalism.

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:47.800
If he was a huge sports nut who was a jock who got like super late in high school and

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:54.220
he was just a big sports freak and did not even own a console, like they wouldn't pursue

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.840
that angle because that's considered normal.

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.280
They would pursue it as he was a sexual deviant because he had an adult friend finder profile.

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:07.760
They would say, okay, well, what's the first thing we can find that's even a little bit

02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:11.100
like not as bland and as mainstream as possible?

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:14.200
Video games is often that thing because a lot of people over a certain age don't understand

02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:15.200
it.

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:16.200
Let me ask this question.

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:21.680
And I'm taking a devil's advocate angle because I think a lot of the sensationalism happens

02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:26.360
because we just want to understand as a society, why?

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.160
Why did this happen?

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:30.240
Why did evil?

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:31.640
There's no other word to describe it.

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:33.760
Why did evil happen?

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:36.960
Where did we as a society fail to allow this to happen?

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:37.960
Well, they keep it.

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:40.240
Here's the other thing too, is they keep saying he operated on his own, but how do you get

02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:41.240
in the theater?

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:44.240
How do you get through the bought a ticket?

02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:45.240
You had to suit up though.

02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:46.240
Right?

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.240
Did you hear what they got up to?

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:50.840
Worrying how, where's he going to hide an air of 15 regardless.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:54.440
I mean, I believe I had heard something in red online.

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:59.180
He used an emergency exit to go to his car and prompt it open so that he could get back

02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:01.000
in the theater regardless.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.600
The guy had his house booby trapped to the nines to try and kill some policemen too.

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:09.160
I mean, he was clearly deranged in all sorts of way.

02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:10.600
He thought of a way.

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:11.960
He thought of a way.

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.000
So whatever.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.800
I mean, but again, let me go back to the devil's advocate question.

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.760
What's wrong with wanting to know where did we fail as a society?

02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.100
Well, that's the difficult question.

02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:31.640
The easy question is to just say, this terrifies me and I'm confused and hurting and this is

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:36.360
a horrible story, but the media is saying that it's video games and I'm old and I've

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.880
never played those and I don't know anyone who plays those so I can see better at night

02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:43.240
knowing that it's that evil yucky thing that's influencing people to do this.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:47.920
It's the quickest way to get people to like they need to associate something because they

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.840
just they don't understand it.

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:55.320
And it's unfortunate that video games is often used because it's a billion dollar industry.

02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:56.700
It's everywhere.

02:01:56.700 --> 02:02:00.720
People will pay attention if you obviously lie and say bullshitty things about the industry

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:05.960
that aren't true because people that play games know that it's not like that.

02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:11.200
But people are desperate for an easy answer to feel better about the grief that they feel

02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:12.200
when they hear stories like this.

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.800
I think that's a very valid answer.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:15.200
I think you're right on the money with that.

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:16.200
I think you're right.

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.500
I think a lot of this tends to you know help people it's all to help people sleep better

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:26.040
at night because hope it doesn't happen to them.

02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:29.200
You know because already people are like well was he mentally ill?

02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:32.100
Had he tried to get help before and then he was denied help?

02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:35.920
You know there are all these existential questions about what drives a person to do this but

02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:40.860
people need like they're like oh shit this like I'm terrified this is a horrible story.

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:45.640
If they can just make that mental association of oh he was influenced because of this maybe

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:49.300
and that's scary and weird because I'm old and I know I don't know what that is.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:51.520
They can they can get that.

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.000
They can pin their terror to something.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:03.000
And because I think there is a youth angle to video games that's a good go to for the

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.640
media if I'm making sense.

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:05.640
Absolutely.

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.640
No you are.

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:07.640
Absolutely.

02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:08.640
Absolutely.

02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.400
Osfer in chat says me and my mom went and saw the midnight showing of The Dark Knight

02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.400
Rises.

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:15.440
A lot of people told us that they were glad that we were okay but I just shrugged it off.

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:18.640
I'm not going to let one guy ruin my movie going experience.

02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.480
It's also funny how now when I tell people they should see the movie they tell me that

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:24.480
they don't want to get shot.

02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:25.480
Absolutely ridiculous.

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.480
Which I agree with.

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:33.940
It had I mean unfortunately I mean what short term memory those people have because it's

02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:35.840
really unfortunate.

02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:40.600
Evil people killed people while they were working on 9-11.

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:45.620
Evil people have shot people on college campuses and on high school campuses.

02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:48.000
Evil people have gone into fast food restaurants and shot people.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.800
I mean it doesn't it doesn't matter where you are.

02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.720
I mean that's just the sad reality of the situation.

02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:58.480
To blame the movie and say I'm not going to go see a midnight movie because I might get

02:03:58.480 --> 02:04:06.240
shot is incredibly ignorant and disrespectful of all the history that came before.

02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.240
I think.

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.240
Right?

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.240
Am I right?

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.240
Maybe?

02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:14.040
You're more likely to get a heart attack from that bucket of popcorn than you are to get

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:15.960
shot at the movie theater.

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:21.560
It doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right that that happened or we should forgive it

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.720
or shrug it off as well.

02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.720
People getting shot.

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:26.000
That's just something that happens.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.880
I'm not saying that.

02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:33.080
We need we still strive as a society to figure out where where were the warning signs so

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:36.240
we can catch it before this happens again.

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:38.560
How do we stop it from happening again.

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:46.000
Anyhow going to Google Plus quickly Wendy S. on Google Plus says we should point out

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.080
that millions of people play these games and with the number of people playing games pointing

02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:55.320
out that the bad guy played games is saying is like saying he watched TV they did in fact

02:04:55.320 --> 02:05:00.120
mention the bad guy in this case played role playing fantasy games ridiculous point in

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:04.520
that millions play Skyrim or wow I have to agree with Mike which I'll read in a minute

02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:08.960
here that acting like ladies and gentlemen online and not accepting people being jerks

02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:13.400
will help as well so let me go to that comment from Act Def that said well for starters stop

02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:19.080
acting like dicks on online games or when gaming other people in general second stop

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:22.680
acting like you're a badass know it all just because you play first person shooter games

02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:27.120
though this applies to other games to also educate the other people that aren't playing

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:31.240
video games and pretty much state to them that video games do not cause violence and

02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:36.560
especially to parents proper education stops this kind of action luckily most people have

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:40.960
stopped blaming video games for this type of situations at least in a general sense

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:47.140
I'm a couple more comments quickly entertainment says we can point out how even the most level

02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:51.800
headed and accepted comments can be wrong for example one of the most widely quoted

02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:55.960
statements from Bowling for Columbine was by Marilyn Manson he said that he wouldn't

02:05:55.960 --> 02:06:01.080
say anything to the people who executed the Columbine attacks he would listen to them

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:05.960
in David Cullen's book Columbine which in a review of the book is called the 9-11 Commission

02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:12.040
report for this tragedy a psychologist who treated Dylan Klebold's dismissed Manson comment

02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:17.200
as the wrong approach Klebold psychologist said that Dylan was a sociopath a manipulator

02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:22.580
a young man absolutely set in his goals allowing him to talk would not have allowed anyone

02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:27.100
to get into this criminals mind he would have charmed them just as he did his parents his

02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:36.320
teachers and his psychologists oh my god Marilyn Manson then is on the warpath now he's been

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:41.600
charmed there's a whole nother thing I mean Marilyn Manson has basically made a career

02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:46.300
off of attention-grabbing and it's the same thing many people have done in our culture

02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:53.760
they've made millions off of grabbing attention Alice Cooper Madonna Gaga kiss right okay

02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:58.760
lastly last comment Preston Evans says blame graduate studies for the shooting he was studying

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:03.880
neuroscience that would do that to anyone psyche in reality there is no current way

02:07:03.880 --> 02:07:08.800
to stop ridicule of one small part of our society for one great event when all parties

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.800
have a part in it it's too hard to fix that just throw one to the wolves instead of of

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:20.840
all taking the slap on the cheek for your part in the grand planned all right I know

02:07:20.840 --> 02:07:27.680
that's a tough topic guys but you know again on CNN and this happened on CNN within hours

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:34.640
there's that pundit on the TV it's video games this is what we have to put up with as a culture

02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:40.400
so some different ideas from our listeners on how to stop it there you go our frugal

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:46.960
question of the week all right let's try to lighten the mood up let's get back into video

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:52.880
games talking about some less serious video games and so forth or in this case I guess

02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:59.360
this is something a little serious going on on Xbox right Loki exactly they've been secretly

02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:05.460
tightening their security and this started I guess with the spring update that we just

02:08:05.460 --> 02:08:11.440
had the one that prepped for you know the fall update that kind of thing right now says

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:18.360
they are encouraging people to check their security information update their passwords

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:24.760
and of course you know the the update they said built on security enhancements for the

02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:31.080
near future and so I guess they're working there might be something that they'll announce

02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:37.420
for like the fall update or something like that my thing is though it I know I understand

02:08:37.420 --> 02:08:41.940
that they're going to be secretly doing this stuff but why go such a secret route with

02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:47.320
it unless you know maybe they're worried that they're if they said oh yeah we're updating

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:52.840
our security people ah so your security had issues that need to be addressed then you

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:57.840
just wouldn't admit to it but the same time when they do it secretly it kind of makes

02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:02.240
me wonder they really did have issues that need to be addressed and they just didn't

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:06.760
want to cop to it so either way at least they're making it step in the right direction I guess

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:11.120
but they really say what security measures are being put in place that weren't in place

02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:16.360
before and I can understand the secrecy behind me as critical as I've been of Microsoft on

02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:20.040
this whole issue in the past I can understand why they don't want to give it all away because

02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:24.160
they don't want to give the people that are hacking the accounts hints so I can understand

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.200
why they're being very vague about it and I'm strangely okay with that I'm glad they

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:34.320
have finally come out and said something finally and that they have said that they've taken

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:40.000
the measures to stop it and I I honestly think that hacked on xbox.com and their whole little

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:45.000
report about that they were working customer service I think that is directly to thank

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:49.160
for this finally coming out finally um and then here's some of the details of stuff they

02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:54.080
do that we increase notifications to members whose accounts may be compromised to add proofs

02:09:54.080 --> 02:10:00.240
update the passwords and if necessary or necessary uh contact xbox support this helps our team

02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.440
lock down an account quickly investigate and restore the account to its rightful owner

02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:10.600
uh we've taken legal action to pull down uh online posts of gamer tags usernames and passwords

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:15.560
gathered from malware phishing schemes to help protect our members our live um spring

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:19.680
update include me behind the scenes improvements to help us build on security enhancements

02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:24.680
for the near future we are sending unique codes to sec um security phone numbers and

02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:30.960
secondary email addresses provided by members to verify authorization for xbox.com purchases

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:36.400
um account change attempts uh not staying from members trusted device I can vouch for

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:42.600
that for a fact because we've had to recently um because you know how much of a pain in

02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.560
the ass it is is to um stop their auto renew well we had some other co-workers I've created

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:53.080
accounts for my old pc but since you know um you know I've worked at the company that

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:58.280
I worked at uh my switch species and so they was asking me for a second verifiable thing

02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.440
problem is though is you can put any phone number you want in there and they'll just

02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:05.160
call you with the security thing so that doesn't really help you but I mean granted it will

02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:11.480
give you a phone number that they can send that to cool or text it to that's the other

02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:15.360
thing too so if like you know there's a lot of free texting programs out there that you

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:21.840
can get a disposable number for that so it's not it's an extra layer but it's not foolproof

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:25.960
have they finally programmed it in on the xbox where it asks you for your card security

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:30.040
code whenever you make a transaction because I know that's available on xbox.com no why

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:35.320
don't they do that that would have helped so in so many situations because the hackers

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:39.120
would not have all those card codes and only let a person do it like three times and then

02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:47.380
it removes the card from file it would seem super easy that's the way to do it am I crazy

02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:52.840
well they wouldn't be as convenient to purchase stuff and that's well too fucking bad because

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:57.680
it's the right thing to do well the right thing is not profitable and then of course

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:02.920
you know we're working on we're working to reduce market incentives for criminal activity

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:07.520
engaging in identity theft trading and stolen accounts and committing credit card fraud

02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:13.880
are legal and violate our terms of use those involved in these activities blah blah blah

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:19.960
so they get banned and blah but here's the thing though is reduce market incentives last

02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:25.440
I remember I believe Madden now started selling those cards too that FIFA was so popular for

02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:31.440
you know those the ones that you can exchange for real money or something basically you

02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:39.360
buy all these fun cards and sell the account so no you're not discouraging it in fact those

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:45.160
companies are encouraging it by adding more games to that process so I don't think that's

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:57.800
really going away but just change your passwords on a regular base all right moving on to another

02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.960
new story here and this has to do with the Wii U we haven't talked a lot about tonight

02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:06.000
but there's still some rumblings going on there's always new rumors every week and this

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.800
time it's about Borderlands 2 but Gearbox actually the co-founder Brian Martell came

02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:17.640
out and said good things about the Wii U quote we really like the Wii U I think it's a really

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:21.180
cool platform I like what they're doing obviously with the touchscreen and it will be interesting

02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:25.880
to see what Microsoft does with their approach to that idea it's one of those problems of

02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:31.200
the Wii the only people who have ever made a lot of money on the Wii is Nintendo if Borderlands

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:37.160
2 was on the Wii U the thing I would most be excited about is inventory management it

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:41.440
would be amazing on that it would just be fantastic and I think the artwork would look

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:44.960
really good with the way they can deal with the resolution and textures I think it's a

02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:49.560
really good console so a lot of people are jumping ahead and saying confirmed Borderlands

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:54.680
2 on Wii U well of course they want to port it to any system they can if it's easy to

02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:00.200
port it over then cool but once again it's kind of running into that same issue with

02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.760
what did DS do all the time oh well put the pause screen stuff the inventory stuff on

02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:09.840
the bottom screen instead of you know having to be a separate screen so do I really want

02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:13.520
to buy another system so that I don't have to pause my game to change my inventory I

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:17.040
don't fucking care I'll pause my game to change my inventory and not have to buy another system

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:25.920
for $300 but that's assuming you know you're a person who doesn't end up buying it for

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.720
some other reason I understand that but at the same time though you know all those inventory

02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:33.920
things at the bottom screen you still have to look away from the screen to do all that

02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:40.760
shit so I don't know oh well also in related news about the Wii U another Wii U game this

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:46.160
one's called Rise of the Guardians has been given a November release date November 23rd

02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:54.360
for the 3DS DS 360 PlayStation 3 Wii and Wii U so this is another game being released in

02:14:54.360 --> 02:15:02.560
November but I mean come on well it's game system to be out by November 23rd do I really

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:09.320
need to read yeah I'm gonna do it again November 18th it's coming out fucking November 18th

02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:14.540
I don't know that for sure but it's coming out November 18th why because everything points

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:20.000
to November 18th as the day I can't wait for it to not be that day I'm gonna play that

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:27.920
clip on repeat I within seven days November 18th would you care to make a bet I have a

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:37.360
costume you don't have a costume that does not exist November 18th 249 to 349 price range

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.240
because of three different skews we already covered this on another show go back in the

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:48.040
archives and find it all right Alan what do you got for us in the silly and weird lawsuit

02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:53.860
department there's the story that's come out company based out of out of Texas excuse me

02:15:53.860 --> 02:16:00.320
I tech patent collector Unilock is the name of the company has filed suit against Mojang

02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:06.220
Mojang as some people may realize or remember is a Marcus persons company he's the developer

02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:15.840
and creator of Minecraft so this company Unilock is suing Mojang for and this is a typo in

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:23.260
the thing that was put out to Mojang like the notice they're being sued Minecraft with

02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:29.260
a D so there's a typo in the claim that gets the name of the product wrong specifically

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:37.480
for the Android version of Minecraft the patent that it's been that they are accusing Mojang

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:43.720
of infringing is a system and method for preventing unauthorized access to electronic data isn't

02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:49.080
that a password like I know I'm kind of ignorant about this this patent I haven't read the

02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:55.320
whole thing because it's very dry but specifically the filing references claim 107 of the patent

02:16:55.320 --> 02:17:00.400
which covers a computer code executable on an electronic device to prevent unauthorized

02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:06.840
access to electronic data stored on the electronic device so I don't know if it's the certain

02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.760
system or style that Minecraft is doing this on the Android but they're saying oh yeah

02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:16.840
we did that and only we can do that so they're suing it and Notch has said unfortunately

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.600
for them they are suing us over a software patent if needed I will throw piles of money

02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:27.040
making sure they don't get a cent software patents are plain evil innovation within software

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:32.840
is basically free and it's growing incredibly rapid patents only slow it down Unilock is

02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:37.400
seeking damages compounded by both pre and post judgment interest as well as ongoing

02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:46.140
royalties from a Mojang so like what the fuck yeah and it's not not Minecraft the PC platform

02:17:46.140 --> 02:18:00.380
but specifically the Android one for whatever reason and not just saying lol at you alright

02:18:00.380 --> 02:18:04.360
this does sound a little patent trollish to me right yeah it's just me because they got

02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:10.320
the name of the yeah I got the name of the product wrong in the in the suit wow yeah

02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:18.160
good luck with that guys moving on Loki people are really trying to give me the word that

02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:23.560
tingle suit it's not gonna happen not gonna happen remember you lost your opportunity

02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:29.280
should bought more copies of what was that again I don't remember the name and title

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:38.920
oh yeah I have judgment brown eye of judgment so let's talk a little bit about oh yeah because

02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:46.680
you know it's been what a week so of course you know they were they've been doing updates

02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.760
on the Kickstarter one of the updates that they did to kind of get people to trust them

02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:56.600
a little more so that they let them know that one of the people on the production team is

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:09.880
actually the guy that helped launch the Amazon Kindle line movie Dolly I believe godly how

02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:15.880
you pronounce his last name anyways he was in charge of the Kindle line you know he's

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:22.580
says you know he's basically his purpose there is to make sure that the system launches and

02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:28.900
you know saying that you know my job is ensure that we meet the needs of gamers and developers

02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:35.000
and you know saying that they're trying to get out the software development kit as quickly

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:40.860
as possible to perspective developers also that they're hiring engineers to join their

02:19:40.860 --> 02:19:47.640
team as well some other announcements that they made regarding the oh yeah is that they're

02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:53.280
going to have an exclusive game to it Robert Bulling's human element is going to have a

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:58.320
prequel on the system human element is going to be a zombie game that's going to be coming

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:07.960
out on consoles in 2015 that's a long time and he's going to have a prequel to be launching

02:20:07.960 --> 02:20:12.960
on oh yeah first actually at the launch of the console and it's going to kind of follow

02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:20.720
the the events that lead up to the actual human element game of course also you may

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:27.920
remember Robert Bulling from well his new studio Robo Robo Toki and he originally you

02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:36.600
know was one developers for Call of Duty modern warfare so prequel and of course he also donated

02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:42.040
ten thousand dollars to the project as well so they've got lots of you know their people

02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:46.240
sign on there's actually a lot of indie developers that are kind of jumping on board as well

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:51.560
a lot of them actually have kick-started projects as well so at least there's gonna be some

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:56.720
games on there and they've been trying to answer questions and whatnot from the community

02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:03.440
regarding why we've seen a controller and that kind of stuff so interest well now that

02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:08.440
they have a game finally to talk about what do you think I think it sounds like a cool

02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:12.520
game I don't know what kind of a game it is though but there's a lot of other like you

02:21:12.520 --> 02:21:17.320
know people there in the Kickstarter you know world they're like that want to bring their

02:21:17.320 --> 02:21:26.080
games to the console like one they're gonna be talking about pretty soon watch the very

02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:31.320
soon is another shadow run game that they're thinking about bringing that to oh yeah as

02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:36.080
well there's a lot of games are right now saying hey you know if we get this game out

02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:42.920
we're gonna put it on you as well so they've got support it just I mean I think it's just

02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:47.720
really early still in the development stage as far as you know the design I mean obviously

02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:55.080
they haven't finalized a you know a controller yet but they're gonna have one it's just you

02:21:55.080 --> 02:22:02.480
know they have a beta kit running or you know a prototype and that's it all right I'm gonna

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:08.200
move on with another story here but first we finally gave that code away instead of

02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:12.960
doing it to just somebody random and unfortunately twice we hit people that weren't around I

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:16.600
finally put a call out in chat and I said look if you're gonna use this code and you

02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:22.400
want the code send me a private message right now and I asked Alan to pick a random number

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:29.240
and the winner was Ospher won the code and yes he's going to use it so congrats thanks

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:33.760
again sorry that contest was a little bit of a mess but I thought I thought we do something

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:38.800
fun with the new website registration but oops I guess people were were checking in

02:22:38.800 --> 02:22:43.920
and then leaving to get dinner so there you go at least we know it's gonna get some good

02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:50.280
use because it was an opt-in thing that time all right let's move on to this I think this

02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:54.920
is a little bit of a follow-up from last week because I remember we brought the first part

02:22:54.920 --> 02:23:00.320
of this up because remember it was about that game on the iPhone that was heavily borrowing

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:07.640
quote-quote assets from torchlight and torchlight was pissed so they you know I guess they went

02:23:07.640 --> 02:23:11.680
and they went on a Twitter rampage and all this stuff but here's the interesting thing

02:23:11.680 --> 02:23:20.420
the company egls actually came out and made a statement I guess oh gosh where is this

02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:27.600
here egls went to touch arcades and said we hardly agree with Travis Baldry from ruining

02:23:27.600 --> 02:23:35.320
games who judged the egls wholesale stole most of the assets from torchlight egls is

02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:40.080
entertainment game labs by the way who is the developer behind this only based on the

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:47.800
similarity between several small monsters the judgment is simply untenable yeah except

02:23:47.800 --> 02:23:53.720
there's a little more to that egls employees say they are quote both crazy game fans and

02:23:53.720 --> 02:24:00.600
a static movie lovers so the comparisons are an accident at best arm heroes said the last

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:05.880
time they checked was still available on itunes it's free to play with purchases well what

02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:11.100
ended up happening a little later egls did come out and say all right we'll remove some

02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:15.900
parts of the game so they talk about that they are going to make some small changes

02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:23.280
to the game they want he but runic games really wants egls to admit that they just told me

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:27.320
well they did they actually stole even the audio from the game and really some unused

02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:33.440
audio clips like a certain sort or something like that that they have in torchlight all

02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:37.960
the audio files were named exactly the same as torchlight all of them like even you know

02:24:37.960 --> 02:24:41.840
stuff that they didn't use he said I also downloaded the app you can unzip them and

02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:45.880
look at any iphone app and there was a sound manifest that listed all the sound files that

02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:50.160
was in the game and they were verbatim all of our sound files including our own misspellings

02:24:50.160 --> 02:25:01.040
uh oh yeah so they stole them yikes now armed heroes online is now down I guess runic filed

02:25:01.040 --> 02:25:05.840
a complaint and finally it got taken down but it took a little while that was on when

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:13.120
did it finally get pulled july 19th that was thursday when it finally got pulled and we

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:20.080
reported on that last week I wonder how many people uh grabbed that game black wolf in

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:23.720
our chat room says they're in china so there was nothing legal they could do yeah they

02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:28.120
can't like they can't sue the company but they can fight them through apple that's what

02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:34.600
they did apparently they can also reinforce stereotypes regarding china what that it's

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:41.680
thieves and gold farmers and all this remember mose and all this or what they copy they copy

02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:48.320
and you know counterfeit stuff well and it's any it seems like any story I read nowadays

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:52.720
about a chinese company making a game it's oh okay would you counterfeit oh there it

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:59.600
is hey look we stole stuff from team fortress 2 this time oh hey shana linko in our chat

02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:04.200
room says they also stole the warlock tier 10 gear for one of their classes from warcraft

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:11.440
world of warcraft so it appears they like to borrow from lots of different places hmm

02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:16.160
but it's gone now and let's I wonder if apple actually like really hammered the ban hammer

02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:20.080
on them because you know apple usually when shit like this happens apple will just say

02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:24.920
you've lost your license done you're not getting to put publish anymore but most of them just

02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:28.520
come back under another name you're not gonna publish anymore until you pay another hundred

02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:33.360
dollars to buy a different license under a different name exactly all right every week

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.840
we invite your emails at mailbag orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer she usually dives

02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:43.680
into the mailbag head first to read some of her favorite emails but in her absence she's

02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:48.320
loaned the hazmat suit to alan who will dive into the email bag i need to state this we

02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:54.200
received a lot of emails this week actually yeah there's a bunch um nine it's it's weird

02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:58.320
because usually we're sitting here with one or two going send us more well you sent more

02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:02.080
this week but here's what we're gonna do because we don't have enough time to read especially

02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:05.240
after some of the other segments now we don't have enough time to read all the emails i'm

02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:10.040
gonna have alan read the first half of the emails that came in we're gonna roll the second

02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:15.780
half to next week okay uh it doesn't mean you can't email us still just send more emails

02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:20.080
mailbag orange lounge radio.com but i mean like i even tried to go in and screen the

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:24.540
emails and like they're all valid they're all pretty good so we want to get to them

02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:32.200
all just not all tonight first email is from robert m subject three questions this is robert

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:37.480
m and i just had three somewhat quick questions or rather two and an observation first have

02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:42.440
you guys had the chance to check out spelunky yet i saw on a preview of the 360 version

02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:47.360
that someone did a mac port so it's one of my steam shortcuts now reportedly steam may

02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:52.140
be getting a version of the game with the 360s graphics and extra modes secondly if

02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:58.600
you're too i haven't checked it out sorry blame the rest of the steam sale on that one

02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:04.440
yeah secondly if you're too busy with minecraft based on what you know do you see updates

02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:10.440
for the ios version falling by the wayside uh with the android version because i don't

02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:15.080
really follow the minecraft forums enough to i haven't played the ios version at all

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:19.360
it's kind of like for ios game it's kind of expensive which is ridiculous because i have

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.080
like 19 credit on my itunes account right now thanks to gift cards but i don't know

02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:27.860
i just i've kind of avoided it for some inexplicable reason but you have it don't you matt have

02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:36.840
what minecraft on ios uh i have it on android oh you have it on android i would think that

02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:42.760
i mean minecraft on pc is so popular because it's pretty it's like limitless right the

02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:47.200
world just goes on forever right i don't think you can do that on the phone and i think the

02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:50.960
the 360 has really taken off so maybe the phone's really limited what they've gotten

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:55.320
there's a lot of like there's object types that aren't there and there's a lot of things

02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:01.720
that you have unlimited supplies of because they saw voice yeah technically the 360 version

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:04.780
is limited too but there was a story that came out this week they've sold 3 million

02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:10.040
copies of that it's one of the biggest xbox live arcade titles ever crazy finally going

02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:14.360
back to the email finally not a question i came across a banner ad for one of those free

02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:20.360
to play empire building games with the mandatory woman in the image being anna williams as

02:29:20.360 --> 02:29:25.740
in literally the tekken 6 character art weird i'm almost certain amco has nothing to do

02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:32.760
with this ftp keep up it's probably from china i'm just saying i'm just gonna refer you

02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:37.660
to that story we just read i'm just gonna say just just rewind the podcast 10 minutes

02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:41.360
and go back to that last story and that's probably what's going on unless it's an amco

02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:45.740
game but i kind of doubt that anna williams by the way was an amazing tekken character

02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:51.580
just saying okay this one i'm not going to read because i think that's an admin question

02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:59.260
for you oh yeah yeah don't read that one sorry that is one we can screen out okay um next

02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:04.740
email from jeffrey help is there a support group to help me stop buying all of the games

02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:09.940
in the summer steam sale maybe a transdermal patch to slowly meter out old video games

02:30:09.940 --> 02:30:16.300
that i will probably never play well you came to the wrong place i've picked up a couple

02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:21.700
indie bundles the thq pack and a few other odds and ends i most likely won't touch half

02:30:21.700 --> 02:30:27.620
of the games included i'm just interjecting my own note here for all of the games that

02:30:27.620 --> 02:30:31.680
i bought this weekend or on this week under the sale i don't have the hard drive space

02:30:31.680 --> 02:30:36.380
to install like half of them at once so yeah it's very easy to have hundreds of gigs of

02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:42.100
games in your library um i most likely won't touch half the games included now i see what

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:47.980
happens to old people when they watch qvc that shit is no joke my mother is addicted

02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:51.820
to qvc and she'll never admit it and she'll hate me for telling you very prescient and

02:30:51.820 --> 02:30:58.940
terrifying observation and it is 100 correct oh my god steam is qvc without the host but

02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:03.740
at least qvc has like marie osmond and shit true story you guys i think i've mentioned

02:31:57.820 --> 02:32:02.780
30 minutes of the show here's here's what i would like to see happen um a little bit

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:09.440
more to help offset the whole buyer's remorse saying i would like to see more of like an

02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:14.360

guy takes a lot of shit and he really is just trying to be a good person you know what i

02:33:22.300 --> 02:33:29.460
mean he's in his 60s now i know i hope i have that much energy when i'm 60 i know travis

02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:32.900
likes to make fun of me and all that stuff and you know compare me to him but i could

02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:37.140
only hope to be that energetic it's only gonna come out like sometime later and he's been

02:33:37.140 --> 02:33:42.220
on some sort of drug or something like that like he's just the only drug that man is on

02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:51.060
his penis okay he's on wow i'm just saying he's got a healthy dose of fabulous and there's

02:33:51.060 --> 02:34:00.060
absolutely nothing wrong with that clearly hey right alan i'm just saying just saying

02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:06.300
out there i mean like if that if that's what's making him so spunky at like age 60 i'm sorry

02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:11.180

02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:15.520
over and over on your show if you want i don't care make fun of me we need more people like

02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:19.180
richard simmons in the world really i mean there is there's nothing wrong with richard

02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:23.220
simmons richard simmons is the antithesis of the evil we were talking about earlier

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:31.340
right what's what is wrong with richard simmons nothing i hope nothing like what you were

02:34:31.340 --> 02:34:34.460
talking about ever does come out because that would greatly disappoint me but i think he's

02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:39.380
just a good person he's just trying to get old people not to die what's wrong with that

02:34:39.380 --> 02:34:48.800
we don't want grandma to die hi olr sorry tonic vision i got a chance yesterday to go

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:53.840
check out the wii u in person they are doing a tensity tour and inviting club nintendo

02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:58.380
members and wanted to share my impressions with you to preface i would just like to say

02:34:58.380 --> 02:35:02.780
that i don't consider myself to really be a fanboy of any particular system and don't

02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:07.160
really have a vested interest in one over another because to me they all have various

02:35:07.160 --> 02:35:12.140
strengths and weaknesses i own basically every current system including the 3ds and the vita

02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:17.880
and i'm generally excited enough by next generation hardware to be a consistent early adopter

02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:22.300
with that said i really cannot find any way to get excited about the wii u even after

02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:27.860
hands-on play with each and every launch title why is this for me it is because of the following

02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:32.780
three reasons so this guy got an exclusive invite to some like top secret come play the

02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:36.580
wii u in an unmarked building type of thing speaking of which i may actually have an impression

02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:44.060
of the wii u after this week oh our ubisoft guy may be bringing a wii u to our game conference

02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:48.860
saying i think it's probably for just dance four but um is there a rabbids game on wii

02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:54.860
u i'm sure there is may or may not he's trying to get a wii u dev kit out but we'll see hmm

02:35:54.860 --> 02:36:00.500
all right sorry item one the name sucks plain and simple why is this a big deal it's a big

02:36:00.500 --> 02:36:04.980
deal because it's indicative of the fact that nintendo has become a little too comfortable

02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:09.260
this is still a we folks yes it has a new controller and yes the graphics are prettier

02:36:09.260 --> 02:36:13.620
but it is still a we at the end of the day what is my motivation for investing in a new

02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:18.340
console when it's still in large part the old console this may make sense when you are

02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:22.220
buying a new smartphone and want those cool new features but you're going to be getting

02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:26.580
a new one in a year anyway this console is going to be in your living room for at least

02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:35.540
five years so why is essentially uh so why is essentially we the sequel two well you

02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:43.300
bought on super nintendo you take a playstation 3 and that's okay sequel sequels to consoles

02:36:43.300 --> 02:36:47.860
are fine there's nothing more buttons okay that was oh well fuck me i guess my whole

02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:54.200
point's invalid thank you loki i've seen the light well i i think he's saying that aside

02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:59.620
from the the graphics hardware i mean the nintendo to the super nintendo was a huge

02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:07.820
step in audio visual mode 7 about your shit up all right all right rob rob yes if there's

02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:15.180
games on the like okay the jump from the no nes sns so you have zelda and mario brothers

02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:19.660
and then you had super mario world and you know zelda 3 links to the past which are two

02:37:19.660 --> 02:37:24.460
like of the best games ever exactly exactly yeah those were amazing fucking games and

02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:29.700
look at how much better they are than the pre you know the previous system are we seeing

02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:33.300
that with the wii u that's the thing it's like we have a new mario game that's exactly

02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:36.900
like the fucking mario game that's already on the wii that's my thing if they came out

02:37:36.900 --> 02:37:41.340
with a game that's like holy fucking shit that's goddamn amazing it's so much better

02:37:41.340 --> 02:37:44.860
than the previous mario game where oh my god look at the zelda game it's fucking amazing

02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:49.540
it's so much better than the one louis then maybe it'd be a different story but it's not

02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:56.660
they are the same fucking games slightly prettier but basically the same it is hard to argue

02:37:56.660 --> 02:38:01.120
with that the only thing i could say is that the zelda game wasn't a launch title but granted

02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:09.700
the mario game was um maybe the best is yet to come i hope we'll see item two mario mario

02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:15.540
mario enough we get it mario sells like crazy everyone loves mario we get it we expect a

02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:19.900
new mario title with the launch of a new nintendo system absolutely what we don't expect or

02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:24.780
deserve is a lazy reskin of a game that came out three years ago this is not enough to

02:38:24.780 --> 02:38:28.700
sell your system nintendo at least not to me it's like eating pizza for dinner does

02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:33.100
it taste good absolutely do i want to eat it every day for the next 10 years hell no

02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:37.940
so don't ask me to i would i was just telling alan last night we haven't ordered pizza in

02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:41.500
a long time and he's like oh you want to go to papa murphy's get a take and bake i'm like

02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:48.140
no i want no i can sausage that's right we are going like we're gonna call straw hat

02:38:48.140 --> 02:38:52.500
and we're gonna get it delivered in a box can you put a christmas ham just right on

02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:57.160
the pizza when i worked at it when i worked at a pizza place i never got sick of pizza

02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:03.220
i could eat pizza every goddamn day and and i would be happy eating pizza every day i

02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:08.540
understand the point item three the technology isn't new i have played games on a touch screen

02:39:08.540 --> 02:39:12.340
and i've played games with motion control putting them together is not innovative and

02:39:12.340 --> 02:39:16.460
really doesn't bring anything terribly exciting to the masses playing through each and every

02:39:16.460 --> 02:39:21.180
launch title i can say for a fact that not one of these really do something unexpected

02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:25.460
with the marriage of these two technologies perhaps a year or so after launch there will

02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:29.340
be a handful of third-party titles that will push the envelope and do something daring

02:39:29.340 --> 02:39:35.320
sadly nintendo certainly won't be leading by example for all of these excuse me for

02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:39.140
all of these reasons i really find myself at a loss when attempting to justify this

02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:44.860
purchase at launch or maybe at all sorry for the rant but that was the feeling i was left

02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:50.500
with after two hours with the wii u and this i mean this guy is an uber nintendo fan because

02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:55.220
you had to be to get in the click to go see the system right yeah but he said that he

02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:59.820
doesn't he doesn't really stand for any console enthusiast enough well then he's kind of like

02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:06.820
any of us i mean i mean i like nintendo but i like sony and microsoft too you know some

02:40:06.820 --> 02:40:11.640
days it just depends who's pissing me off this week on a separate note i wanted to share

02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.620
with you another preview of some art that will be showcased at the upcoming video game

02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:22.000
power up art exhibition this will increase your x attached here are some pixel sculptures

27 chicago.com i'll paste that in chat in a second if you can't make it in person thanks

02:40:49.980 --> 02:40:54.540
and i hope to see you there tonic vision sadly none of us are in chicago at least here in

02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:59.740
the room uh and i won't be through the area but um i know we have some listeners in chicago

02:40:59.740 --> 02:41:06.880
we have quite a few actually so uh i i expect a full report tap tap tap one more i'll do

02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.020
one more and that's just gonna leave three left over we'll figure out what we do with

02:41:10.020 --> 02:41:16.380
those emails roll them over yep uh this is from nasty canasta evening olr crew among

02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:21.020
all the discussion about theaters pricing on your show bobby blackwolf sand around the

02:41:21.020 --> 02:41:26.780
web i thought it was interesting that nobody considered to bring up the square enix tax

02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:31.140
there have been instances where rpgs and related titles published by square enix especially

02:41:31.140 --> 02:41:36.980
rereleases have a price that is artificially raised above the norm take squenix's ps1 classics

02:41:36.980 --> 02:41:42.840
catalog for example whereas most games are priced at 5.99 chrono cross chrono trigger

02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:48.220
all final fantasies and xenogears are worth nine are worth 9.99 to purchase oddly front

02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:54.780
know why that is you know why that is because you'll pay it plain and simple plane is i

02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:58.140
mean i there there's really no other way to any any square fan is going to be this is

02:41:58.140 --> 02:42:01.660
my own commentary any square fan is going to be cuckoo bananas about those games and

02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:06.140
i mean they're to be fair they're legendary larger games too because i know xeno gears

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:11.740
was two discs yeah fantasy seven was three discs and file hasi eight was also three and

02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:16.940
nine and chrono cross was two yeah so i mean yeah but i mean i don't know it's but yes

02:42:16.940 --> 02:42:21.260
i understand this day and age that's kind of a weak argument oddly front mission three

02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:25.580
and vagrant story do not have inflated prices despite both having rpg elements and those

02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:30.940
were more sleeper hits too or cult hits that is true for them um and those were also one

02:42:30.940 --> 02:42:35.760
disc yeah i'm sure the tax also applies to titles available from nintendo's virtual console

02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:42.520
service at least in japan nasty canasta i love that name by the way and uh wasn't when

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:47.660
secret of mana was ported to ios and put on the apple store wasn't it like really expensive

02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:51.860
like it's four or five bucks which was outrageous for what it was just a port of the SNES i

02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:57.420
want to say those games on nintendo and super nintendo virtual console were like 100 microsoft

02:42:57.420 --> 02:43:05.260
points more or excuse me wow 100 nintendo points more i'm losing it tonight sorry i

02:43:05.260 --> 02:43:09.300
was distracted because look who came to say hello look who never comes out in the studio

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:13.940
to say hello and look who's here it's maruko kitty kitty kitty do you have a comment maruko

02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:22.200
are you brown he's sniffing the microphone so how is your cat by the way um sanrio is

02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:29.180
doing much better she just needed a day to um have it basically she gets constipated

02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:34.060
and when she has a really bad hairball and she's plugged up it'll tweak this nerve in

02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:38.820
her stomach and it completely like knocks her out for a day where she just she can't

02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:43.460
eat she's she gets dizzy if she walks she'll stumble and fall down she just needed a day

02:43:43.460 --> 02:43:50.260
to get better so kitty can't poop but she can poop now sorry for the tmi uh but yeah

02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:54.500
that it's really scary to see your cat like completely out of it you don't know what's

02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:59.020
wrong well and a really good friend of ours had to put down their cat this week and i

02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:03.020
know that's like really difficult and it was it was a long time trying to get him better

02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:07.800
and figure out what was wrong with him so they finally had to it's yeah it's tough we

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:11.620
get really attached to our pets yeah so i love my kitty and i'm glad that she's better

02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:15.080
but i need to make sure that doesn't happen again because i don't like seeing her like

02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:21.180
that um yeah that's it for emails all right let's get to the fus of the week it's the

02:44:21.180 --> 02:44:25.460
part of the show where we rent why because we can it's our show

02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:49.780
uh f you to people that change lanes without signaling there's a lot of you out there i

02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:55.580
don't know why people do that it's really annoying um also f you to the steam sale for

02:44:55.580 --> 02:45:01.300
i guess i should blame myself but i'm blaming the steam sale uh for having me spend way

02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:07.860
more money than i i wanted to on this new sale and uh buying games that i i will probably

02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:16.540
play but just right away and just adds more games to the list and then um yeah that's

02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:25.500
it uh alan you wanna go yeah on friday night my i have this gorgeous 25-inch hilt packard

02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:32.340
uh monitor for my pc the picture on it's amazing and on friday night it started to flicker

02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:38.380
like there was maybe some emf interference from like a nearby appliance or maybe the

02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:42.340
backlight of the lcd was starting to go out which was terrifying because i don't want

02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:48.860
to buy a new monitor right now so that sucked but i replaced the i took it off hdmi cable

02:45:48.860 --> 02:45:55.220
and i plugged it into my video card with a dvi cable and now it's fine so the hdmi cable

02:45:55.220 --> 02:46:00.780
went bad so fu to shitty eight dollar amazon hdmi cables that make you think your monitor

02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:04.740
is dead well you should have got a sixty dollar monster cable they're all the same just buy

02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:09.100
the cheapest possible cable yeah it was a belkin on amazon it lasted two years but i

02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:15.740
guess the hdmi cable went bad so f you to heart attacks that yeah over technology people

02:46:15.740 --> 02:46:20.980
wholesale.com they're damn cheap and it's one day shipping to us that's where i get

02:46:20.980 --> 02:46:28.540
cables when i get happy did they pay you for that ad no next time they should but they're

02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:32.180
so cal or actually no they're not so cal they're i don't know somewhere in the bay area or

02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:37.660
something and so it's only my day not bad um i don't really have a lot of angst things

02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:43.740
are going pretty good i i have a lot going on so fu to being really busy and i'm kind

02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:47.260
of obligated to something over the next couple months is really gonna really cut into my

02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:51.700
weekends which really stinks because i really need to like get back to san francisco and

02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:57.220
see like grandpa warcraft and some other people over there and so on and fu to the fact that

02:46:57.220 --> 02:47:02.260
the annual showing of showgirls which we must go to is the same day as another theater thing

02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:08.460
i have here so i've got to make sure i can go because i love movie showgirls it's so

02:47:08.460 --> 02:47:20.380
bad it's good you don't know shit all right uh let's move on loki one more news story

02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:24.540
for us then i've got something and then that's the part where we get to taking your calls

02:47:24.540 --> 02:47:30.940
at 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge radio but after two more stories here

02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:38.780
so you can't go to both of those events because there are different places okay the same sorry

02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:44.380
i've seen that's good i'm happy you made a showgirls showgirls one too many times and

02:47:44.380 --> 02:47:47.900
it was only because i want to see the boobies that's that's really the only reason to watch

02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:55.700
showgirls more than one time anyway so just saying um so let's talk a little bit about

02:47:55.700 --> 02:48:00.060
kickstarter because why not we we always talk about kickstarter because it's in the news

02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:05.140
all the time so a couple new games shadow run online i'm kind of excited about that

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:10.180
because shadow runs pretty awesome um but they're starting a kickstarter they're looking

02:48:10.180 --> 02:48:16.020
to raise half a million dollars by august 14th so you can go check them out at kickstarter

02:48:16.020 --> 02:48:24.700
um i'd i'd be interested in seeing a shadow run game um that's online i've already backed

02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:30.440
the other one uh defense grid 2 if you're a fan of the tar defense games obviously you're

02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:35.740
probably familiar with defense grid um they're trying to get some funding for kickstarter

02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:40.420
or from kickstarter as well they kind of went the whole penny arcade route where you know

02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:46.400
they put the goal down as 250 000 but really they need 1 million dollars to fully fund

02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:51.300
the sequel otherwise you only get you know if they reach their goal of you know quarter

02:48:51.300 --> 02:48:57.860
million dollars you get an expansion then if a half a million you get a remastered version

02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:03.140
in the you know of the first game in the second game's engine and at you know three quarters

02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:08.180
of a million you get you know level editor and then 1 million you get a sequel it's kind

02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:13.860
of lame but that's how they're doing it and then last but not least if you're looking

02:49:13.860 --> 02:49:21.100
for a alternative to kickstarter uh the website games planet has launched a new service called

02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:28.460
games planet lab it's basically a crowd uh funding service it's in the uk um which is

02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:33.140
kind of cool because it's not us only because kickstarter is us only um so you have to have

02:49:33.140 --> 02:49:38.580
you know a way to you know pay via amazon on that but it's based in europe and they

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:44.020
will have uh projects from around the world and uh already they've got a couple games

02:49:44.020 --> 02:49:52.980
on um the service that you can fund one's magrunner it's a you know title from 3am studios

02:49:52.980 --> 02:50:00.420
and uh it's like a first person puzzler game and then they've also got uh day one which

02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:08.100
is like an adult themed point and click adventure game like leisure suit larry uh they say it's

02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:15.340
uh heavily influenced by uh the devil's dictionary i don't know i've never never heard of that

02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:21.660
so um can't really say i believe the difference so with this uh service as opposed to kickstart

02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:27.020
because i think one of the reasons uh people are kind of like i don't know about you know

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:32.260
crowdfunding stuff you know how we know we're actually a game i think they have um like

02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:38.460
a process that they actually kind of review these games before they you know allow them

02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:42.740
to be on the service also it's only going to be games on this service since you know

02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:52.040
it is game planet labs um so that's kind of neat i guess if they have that um so cool

02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:59.420
and so that's the alternative if you want to check it out it's i believe at lab.gamesplanet.com

02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:08.020
want to say yeah lab.gamesplanet.com all right well uh since you just did a bunch of kickstarter-esque

02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:13.020
stuff here um this one is kind of another kickstarter inspired thing but like it or

02:51:13.020 --> 02:51:18.020
not kickstarter is now kind of a part of pop culture right now and that's probably one

02:51:18.020 --> 02:51:24.180
of those things that we'll look back on in 10 years and on the next vh1 i love the 2010

02:51:24.180 --> 02:51:29.220
decade special you'll have you know someone there talking about how everybody was in the

02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:33.700
kickstarter and the other stuff inspired and one of the things that kickstarter has inspired

02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:40.260
from namco bandai is nino starter and it has to do with the upcoming game nino kuni wrath

02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:45.020
of the white witch wizards edition we have talked about this collector's edition before

02:51:45.020 --> 02:51:48.500
on the show and we talked about how it's going to come with the game and a 300 page book

02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:54.500
a little doll and some dlc will all be included in this well now they're expanding this for

02:51:54.500 --> 02:52:00.900
the us based on the number of pre-orders so it doesn't say though what they will keep

02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:05.040
adding to it when they hit different levels but i'm going to the page right now which

02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:11.600
you can get at nino starter.com they don't say exactly what you will unlock but apparently

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:14.660
if you hit these different pre-order goals they're going to add stuff to the collector's

02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:21.420
edition which is kind of cool oh here it is the first one the first item is a set of five

02:52:21.420 --> 02:52:28.740
nino kuni prince so little crappy little postcards basically you know if that's you know but

02:52:28.740 --> 02:52:34.580
that's cool i like that they're adding more stuff based on the number of pre-orders that's

02:52:34.580 --> 02:52:39.260
i kind of like that i gotta admit i mean it's so what if it's nothing that exciting it's

02:52:39.260 --> 02:52:43.680
still it's exciting to people that are really into this series i'd be all over this shit

02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:49.100
if warcraft did this you know what i mean so that's a cute a cute little thing that

02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:53.900
kickstarters inspired yes yeah all right i think it'd be better if it was like the regular

02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:59.860
game and you know the more people that pre-order the game like more free shit like they upgrade

02:52:59.860 --> 02:53:03.980
it for free like do a special edition or something like that and have crap that they throw in

02:53:03.980 --> 02:53:07.740
there yeah that'd be a little bit better because collector's editions that's really a niche

02:53:07.740 --> 02:53:13.340
niche niche audience you're you're not going to niche game with it now you know collector's

02:53:13.340 --> 02:53:17.020
edition that's going to be even more niche than that it's 99 dollars too if you want

02:53:17.020 --> 02:53:20.900
that collector's edition fuck that well see here's the thing i believe it or not i'm tempted

02:53:20.900 --> 02:53:25.420
because i really do love you know the studio ghibli stuff and and the game looks good but

02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:30.020
i just don't like i feel really weird taking that leap of faith when i don't really know

02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:34.340
if the game's good or not i guess i could go a little japanese pretty good i know but

02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:38.340
just because it looks pretty good come on what have we learned sometimes games that

02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:45.100
look good don't really end up being very good or lasting a long time so i don't know but

02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:52.820
i do think that doll is really cute though and the dlc might as well all right anyhow

02:53:52.820 --> 02:53:58.140
uh we'll see we'll see if i get on board or not apparently uh you have until august 31st

02:53:58.140 --> 02:54:02.720
to do this and they even have the little countdown clock there on nino starter.com it says right

02:54:02.720 --> 02:54:09.020
now 2683 fans does that mean that many people are pre-ordered i'm assuming i don't know

02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:14.500
maybe but uh little trailers available there and everything it's a cute little idea all

02:54:14.500 --> 02:54:18.460
right we're going to open up the skype line at 1877 game olr or our username on skype

02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:21.540
is orange lounge radio if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked

02:54:21.540 --> 02:54:27.420
about tonight or maybe there's a story you think we've missed the skype line is now open

02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:30.340
we'll get to last minute stories in a minute but i also want to read some of the tweets

02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:35.340
that have come in at twitter.com slash olr and i'm going to start off tonight with a

02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:40.900
tweet from dave falcon tweets us and says a few days ago i picked up duke nukem forever

02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:51.380
at game stop for $4.99 yeah wow my how the mighty have fallen and fallen quick would

02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:59.980
you buy it for $4.99 no i'd be curious i got well maybe it was gearbox made borderlands

02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:05.660
dude i understand that and it's really sad what they had to work with uh for duke nukem

02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:08.980
uh that's i mean that was kind of one of the things too it's like they lost a lot of credit

02:55:08.980 --> 02:55:12.500
with that but borderlands 2 looks really awesome so all right let me go to the phones because

02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:16.260
we are getting a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is excellent

02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:21.740
hey x-link buddy what's up nothing really too much hey loki i'm also hyped for borderlands

02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:26.580
2 i'm so happy that ashley is actually going to have a role inside of it playing as tiny

02:55:26.580 --> 02:55:31.700
tina which is absolutely great because i love watching uh hey ash what you're playing so

02:55:31.700 --> 02:55:36.860
i i thought she was great doing those so it's going to be kind of intriguing to see uh how

02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:42.460
all that works out after after they uh bring everything to uh to it it's good to know too

02:55:42.460 --> 02:55:45.740
that they actually have the game already done so hopefully they'll patch up any kind of

02:55:45.740 --> 02:55:50.180
bugs or anything within that game so this hype train has me very interested with i'm

02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:54.660
a big big fan of the first one i have the first one with all the dlc and actually i

02:55:54.660 --> 02:55:58.620
would like to team up with some people go through the the arena part and get the rest

02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:02.920
of the humans i did the the first arena by myself but the other ones are just brutal

02:56:02.920 --> 02:56:07.780
after that so even with all my weapons i have so i swear i will try and play the game soon

02:56:07.780 --> 02:56:12.700
i had to remove it from my hard drive because i needed the disk space but um it'll be back

02:56:12.700 --> 02:56:18.500
uh really a couple things real quick chaos rings from uh square enix is 12.99 actually

02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:23.260
on the uh is store right on the is store and then the sequel which came out not too long

02:56:23.260 --> 02:56:30.500
ago was actually 17.99 so those are really expensive compared to xeno gears and the rest

02:56:30.500 --> 02:56:34.700
of those for 9.99 i'd rather get those anyways at least that way you know i would have a

02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:40.820
copy i could always play um compared um you know because you know you know stuff happens

02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:44.820
you know this can break you know get scratched really easily um you know they're they're

02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:49.020
very hard those are games also they were very hard to come by too you look on ebay you're

02:56:49.020 --> 02:56:53.680
trying to find them they were going up to 50 70 80 a pop for some of those games so

02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:59.340
um just to say oh well you know they're trying to you know gouge the price you know 10 bucks

02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:04.460
it's a very simple price i'd rather pay 10 bucks than 50 or 60 you know wow yeah the

02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:08.260
same thing it was the same thing with the seam sales you know i'm looking i bought uh

02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:13.660
the dudgeon seed collection for seven dollars and 49 cents that was like 75 off i bought

02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:19.020
a brink for five bucks i know that's a crappy game but i like these little person shooters

02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:22.460
from time and time after having a rough day of work coming home and shooting something

02:57:22.460 --> 02:57:26.620
it's really great to have some of this stuff and then of course i bought for my girlfriend

02:57:26.620 --> 02:57:33.620
uh the secret of the magic crystal for a dollar 25 so i mean you can't really beat those prices

02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:38.020
for the for the sale so i'm looking at my ipad right now at the store and yeah i mean

02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:43.860
square really does charge a premium for some of their games final fantasy tactics 17.99

02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:49.740
yeah chaos rings 2 just like you said 19.99 on the ipad yeah i i'll pass on that you can

02:57:49.740 --> 02:57:54.740
get imaginary range for free yeah i have my three i have my 3ds that can you know play

02:57:54.740 --> 02:57:58.620
those games just some of those games just fine and you know i'd rather do it or something

02:57:58.620 --> 02:58:04.180
like that then you know i didn't worry about paying you know 18 19 bucks on a on an app

02:58:04.180 --> 02:58:07.900
that when i'm middle doing something like you like you said basically for mass effect

02:58:07.900 --> 02:58:15.300
3 is going to crash upon me you know i i pass on that so um oh it's absolutely 100 you know

02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:20.220
bulletproof it's not going to crash or anything maybe but even then that's that's a considerable

02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:26.820
amount of money that's a big chunk so um especially since i have most of those games anyways and

02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:31.180
it is everyone get the same thing you know i'm not i really don't feel like pay 17 18

02:58:31.180 --> 02:58:37.500
bucks for it again i'm sorry so um and also about these shootings and you know they always

02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:40.940
you know every time when some of this happens you know they're you know always blaming the

02:58:40.940 --> 02:58:47.100
media some somehow whether it be video games uh movies you know uh music you know it's

02:58:47.100 --> 02:58:50.900
kind of weird they never mentioned books like what kind of books was a person reading what

02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:55.780
kind of reading was the person doing to get to maybe even this frame of mind oh some books

02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:59.780
are just as dangerous just as anything else some people still there's no moving objects

02:58:59.780 --> 02:59:04.220
or anything within books excellent some people still blame books i mean you know granted

02:59:04.220 --> 02:59:08.720
i'm getting a little historical here but fahrenheit 451 was a book ironically that was kind of

02:59:08.720 --> 02:59:12.740
all about that and we still have this day and age you know people that try to ban books

02:59:12.740 --> 02:59:17.080
from the public library you know what catcher in the rye always comes up on that list because

02:59:17.080 --> 02:59:23.340
yeah it's smut you know harry potter no but yeah yeah absolutely but you know what we

02:59:23.340 --> 02:59:28.660
need to do too is also look at the good stories look at the things i've done you know somebody

02:59:28.660 --> 02:59:32.940
saved you know a family or something from a building building you know maybe try to

02:59:32.940 --> 02:59:36.740
try to twist out you know not really twist around a little bit maybe try to see if that

02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:40.820
person is a gamer say hey look this person was a gamer this person just saved a family

02:59:40.820 --> 02:59:45.380
you know he you know just because these people are gamers doesn't mean you know oh i like

02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:49.940
halo and warcraft i don't go around you know decapitating people shooting people in the

02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:53.900
head because you know i'm seeing this you know in the game and i'm going okay i think

02:59:53.900 --> 02:59:58.620
this is okay you know it's what about all the good things gamers do do you know they

02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:02.700
always look for those little i understand me now i understand the way it works and the

03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:07.500
way it runs i always i'm i help some local media outlets here and i understand that and

03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:11.300
it's always you know trying to get one step ahead of everybody else and try to look for

03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:17.580
that one little niche that you can go aha this is you know the reason though it's not

03:00:17.580 --> 03:00:24.180
even totally true but um you know m&m basically put it to words of best on the way i am and

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:30.780
i love that lyric when he goes um they blame it on maryland and the heroin where will and

03:00:30.780 --> 03:00:35.500
look where it's at and you know it's kind of funny because those little things it's

03:00:35.500 --> 03:00:40.980
kind of like looking for that little niche looking for that little thing to to basically

03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:46.100
saying you know if these weren't here just what you know this would have you know would

03:00:46.100 --> 03:00:50.380
never happen in the first place though it would and it's unfortunate too because it

03:00:50.380 --> 03:00:55.540
you know happened in such a closed area but you know like i you know like you said before

03:00:55.540 --> 03:00:59.540
i even after seeing these stories stuff happens i'm still going to go to libraries i'm still

03:00:59.540 --> 03:01:03.300
going to go to grocery stores i'm still going to go to movie theater watch my movies you

03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:08.340
know i and i don't you know we should let these little things affect our everyday life

03:01:08.340 --> 03:01:13.180

bobby would call it yay but you you ended up winning a steam code though so yeah i mean

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:34.740
it's it's good that i won that but like all my friends are like oh i have no money and

03:02:34.740 --> 03:02:39.300
now i've been like using all my wallet funding on these steam sales and i'm just like i only

03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:44.260
bought one game and that game wasn't even for me like i bought um mass effect one for

03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:51.460
a friend oh there you go so have you been tempted by any of the steam sales um not really

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:59.620
like i'm just sort of looking at game i'm sorry say that again uh-oh did we lose him

03:03:27.500 --> 03:03:32.380
hopefully it'll come back hey you still there uh yes we can hear you we're taping go ahead

03:03:32.380 --> 03:03:36.380
and keep going with your question for the podcasties we're we're offline right now but

03:03:36.380 --> 03:03:41.340
the podcasters are still hearing this so um i had asked you if there was anything that

03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:47.920
you were wanting off of steam oh yeah yeah well i was like looking at um i'm tempted

03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:53.440
by amnesia and alan wake like alan wake won because i heard it's kind of silent hilly

03:03:53.440 --> 03:03:59.300
and so i might like that and amnesia actually did i watched a group play through it and

03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:03.020
i played like a little part of it myself but like there are some bits and pieces i missed

03:04:03.020 --> 03:04:07.940
so i should really get the full game but i don't know that game made me terrified at

03:04:07.940 --> 03:04:11.540
some points like there's actually a video of me playing through it at one point and

03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:16.780
i'm just like screaming when i do something blatantly obvious that hurts me and i don't

03:04:16.780 --> 03:04:19.780
know it's a great game wait you're saying there's this video like it's out there on

03:04:19.780 --> 03:04:28.260
youtube yes oh you need to give me the link uh okay here it's a video of like a bunch

03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:32.380
of people like in my group down at college we all get together and we play games late

03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:38.260
at night and um that was one of them and it just has all the screen and you you film your

03:04:38.260 --> 03:04:43.580
antics and put them up on youtube for your adoring public it wasn't me okay it was the

03:04:43.580 --> 03:04:46.980
guy who was in our group he brings in his desktop and i even know this but he has like

03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:51.900
a microphone sitting behind the desk that we're playing at and he's just recording everything

03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:59.660
and so he takes the screen and then he like slows it down and it's pretty hilarious all

03:04:59.660 --> 03:05:02.580
right well while you're looking for that link for me is there anything else you want to

03:05:02.580 --> 03:05:10.780

03:05:53.740 --> 03:05:58.860
are really funny i love the one that alan put on my wall on facebook of the guy playing

03:05:58.860 --> 03:06:03.500
through amnesia where it just starts and like the first door opens he's like lol nope and

03:06:03.500 --> 03:06:08.100
quits it's like a 10 second video all right let's go to the phones again and hope the

03:06:08.100 --> 03:06:12.000
phone doesn't drop during the call hi you are on orange launch radio who's this you're

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:18.940
such a hater about the mass effect 3 pc game it pisses me off how can you not be mad because

03:06:18.940 --> 03:06:23.980
the xbox does the same exact thing you but you haven't no xbox hasn't robbed me of credits

03:06:23.980 --> 03:06:31.180
yet it doesn't matter it robbed you of playing it on pc and that's a far worse offense what

03:06:31.180 --> 03:06:36.060
what surely you didn't just call to complain what else did you call about um no actually

03:06:36.060 --> 03:06:41.940
it was all complaining um because i'm mad you didn't play jack levin's theme during

03:06:41.940 --> 03:06:46.300
that f-zero break when it's clearly the best song in the game the folks listening on the

03:06:46.300 --> 03:06:50.820
podcast don't even know that we played f-zero music during the break i don't care they're

03:06:50.820 --> 03:06:57.660
not special um they didn't get to hear f-zero music use an opinion of shane or shanes what

03:06:57.660 --> 03:07:03.700
i'm just saying um anyway making sure the podcast listeners know you're a jerk there

03:07:03.700 --> 03:07:09.380
you know that um and now i have to go find my copy of f-zero because i may need to play

03:07:09.380 --> 03:07:16.100

and they're really gross why do people do that i don't i don't need to see your wounds

03:07:23.460 --> 03:07:28.700
all over facebook my finger is kind of like the current model 3ds it has three different

03:07:28.700 --> 03:07:34.360
layers now it's got the fingernail and then the finger and then the huge like flap that's

03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:42.340

03:07:46.820 --> 03:07:53.740

03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:06.780
he hung up there you go thank you shane i think all right uh anyhow let me uh i want

03:08:06.780 --> 03:08:11.020
to go to one other okay this is the youtube that ossofer was point oh this is a six minute

03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:19.060
long video oh good he linked me right to the right part good job osfer it's loading i'm

03:08:19.060 --> 03:08:23.100
gonna have to wait for that to load it's buffering meanwhile we'll take one more call hi you're

03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:27.820
on orange lawn's radio who's this what up guys it's zinek or the okc how you guys doing

03:08:27.820 --> 03:08:33.260
hey i'm good how you doing zinek or hey no staying employed that's that in this economy

03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:39.160
that's a hard thing to do yeah yeah actually i've been playing a hell of a lot of the streets

03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:46.500
of rage v5 remake that got pushed out oh yeah did sega succeed in getting that pulled it

03:08:46.500 --> 03:08:50.940
already escaped to the internet there's no stopping it that's right they may kill their

03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:57.080
own personal link but it's out in the wilds now that's very true so uh what made you decide

03:08:57.080 --> 03:09:02.340
to play the play this remake you just love streets of rage dude they they did rearrangement

03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:08.460
of usazuki's music what what version do you need you thought f0's music was good you put

03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:12.060
that stuff on with real instruments and everything behind it it's amazing you want to put it

03:09:12.060 --> 03:09:17.260
up in the club and just play all night so the soundtrack alone is worth checking it

03:09:17.260 --> 03:09:21.340
out for that's cool yeah i ripped the whole thing it's already on my phone so i can listen

03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:27.060
to it in my car when i'm driving awesome awesome yeah but it's actually a pretty faithful remake

03:09:27.060 --> 03:09:31.620
so it you know it's all pixelated and everything even if you make it full screen so it's almost

03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:35.980
like playing on a on maim or something else like that but it's all custom so it did quite

03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:42.340
a good job with it in fact that it's almost i i understand why sega might want to squash

03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:45.980
it because it's almost a better version what they've been putting out for their games it's

03:09:45.980 --> 03:09:50.500
better than what they do to sonic in some ways exactly probably yeah i could see that

03:09:50.500 --> 03:09:56.700
i could see that so uh what else is on your mind this week uh that's pretty much it i

03:09:56.700 --> 03:10:00.440
mean yeah the steam's taking care of everything but they still can't lure me to skyrim until

03:10:00.440 --> 03:10:04.140
they get a game of the year version so i can get all the dlc at once for one price thanks

03:10:04.140 --> 03:10:10.180
very much there is no dlc on pc yet i believe uh the vampire dlc comes out when it's got

03:10:10.180 --> 03:10:15.140
to be really soon right yeah but they went sooner or later it will but i did pick up

03:10:15.140 --> 03:10:21.340
the uh the uh arkham city dlc for three bucks so i played my two hours of that and was like

03:10:21.340 --> 03:10:27.140
ah okay neat oh yeah that's right that just uh that was the big thing that was on sale

03:10:27.140 --> 03:10:31.420
during the week too i forgot about that yeah almost all the dlc has their own little mini

03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:34.660
sales you just got to go into the game to see them if they're not currently running

03:10:34.660 --> 03:10:42.140
on the front page so so you all got like what 30 minutes to one and a half hours to go and

03:10:42.140 --> 03:10:45.860
check out all the dlc that you want so you can get it at a worthwhile price that's right

03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:50.580

03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:30.100
let me uh read this real quick this is a link from tiger claw and i love this story microsoft

03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:39.260
had to apologize because a programmer hid the phrase big boobs in company software microsoft

03:11:39.260 --> 03:11:44.700
apologized for the joke because it was an offensive string the computer did fix or did

03:11:44.700 --> 03:11:49.660
fix the issue with a patch the offending code is within computer code that connects the

03:11:49.660 --> 03:11:55.180
linux kernel to a microsoft virtualization product now apparently there's a string in

03:11:55.180 --> 03:12:01.140
the hexadecimal computer language that says in hexadecimal big boobs if you can figure

03:12:01.140 --> 03:12:05.940
out how to read it the code was spotted by programmers and caused controversy within

03:12:05.940 --> 03:12:10.300
the community because of course they want to distance themselves from being just a all

03:12:10.300 --> 03:12:16.780
male pig-headed club but i don't know i think big big boobs is harmless that's funny i'm

03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:23.620
sorry big boobs is funny even even women like boobs right yes if jamie were here she would

03:12:23.620 --> 03:12:31.380
say yes trust me but they say oh it's childish humor da da da da da da da da it's just boobs

03:12:31.380 --> 03:12:36.980
it's just boobs all right that's all i have for the tweets uh loki do you have any of

03:12:36.980 --> 03:12:42.260
