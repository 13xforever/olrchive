8000	10000	Dark Sakura,
10000	13000	Sky and Loki
13000	15000	Tonight July 8th, 2012
15000	17000	Sony purchases Gaikai
17000	19000	What does this mean for retail?
19000	22000	Microsoft securing a domain name leads to speculation
22000	24000	and a court in the European Union
24000	27000	makes a huge decision on reselling digital games
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	it's Orange Lounge Radio
39000	42000	We are live as we always are
42000	44000	Sunday nights at The Voice of Geeks
44000	45000	or VOG Network
45000	47000	www.vognetwork.com
47000	50000	Sunday nights 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
50000	52000	right after Mr. Bobby Blackwolf
52000	54000	and his fantastic show
54000	55000	also on the network
55000	57000	If you are listening to us live
57000	59000	get your butt in our chatroom and participate
59000	61000	so we can read your comments
61000	63000	live.vognetwork.com
63000	65000	We always appreciate you guys
65000	67000	participating along with our show
67000	69000	I said your show, it is your show too
69000	70000	it's all of our shows
70000	72000	We do like to bill ourselves
72000	75000	as the show where every gamer has a voice
75000	77000	This voice you're hearing right now is Rob Roberts
77000	79000	I'm one of three hosts on this show
79000	82000	along with the absent, sadly, tonight
82000	83000	Dark Sakura
83000	85000	Dark Sakura sadly called in a couple of hours
85000	86000	before the show tonight
86000	87000	She's not going to be able to make it
87000	89000	She's recovering from being sick
89000	90000	and she said
90000	91000	Garris
91000	93000	But joining us here in studio is tech master Loki
93000	94000	Hello
94000	95000	How are you doing, Loki?
95000	97000	I'm doing good
97000	98000	Yeah?
98000	99000	Yeah
99000	100000	Alright, it's all good?
100000	103000	I'm full now because I've had like a liter of root beer
103000	105000	That is a lot of soda
105000	106000	What did you think about
106000	108000	not to get all political on this show
108000	110000	but since, you know, I know a lot of gamers
110000	112000	and I know a lot of gamers that drink soda
112000	114000	there was a lot of feedback to that whole New York City law
114000	115000	that they were talking about
115000	116000	where they were going to ban
116000	118000	the super-sized drinks and all that
118000	120000	What did you think about that?
120000	121000	Buy two drinks and
121000	122000	That's exactly
122000	124000	Like, I just don't understand
124000	125000	What am I going to do?
125000	127000	I can't get a large soda
127000	129000	I mean, the large soda, I understand
129000	131000	it's twice as much as the small soda
131000	133000	but how am I going to get a large
133000	134000	Buy two of them
134000	136000	I mean, I don't even understand why that's a problem
136000	138000	I somehow knew in my mind
138000	141000	that's exactly what you'd say
141000	143000	Maybe having done this show with you for ten years
143000	145000	and knowing you about us long is probably
145000	147000	I can predict these things
147000	149000	I just, it's, it's dumb
149000	150000	What they need to do is
150000	152000	they need to just charge, you know
152000	153000	Hey, I'll tell you what
153000	155000	We'll charge you, uh, you know
155000	157000	half price of a large for two
157000	159000	or, you know, each of the smalls
159000	161000	and then we'll give you a large cup for free
161000	162000	How about that?
162000	163000	And then you just pour it in there
163000	165000	and, you know, loophole
165000	167000	For ten years and knowing you about us long
167000	168000	feedback, sorry
168000	170000	Ugh, I am not with it tonight
170000	172000	I'm hosting the show tonight
172000	173000	I'm not with it
173000	175000	I forgot to enable the live check-ins
175000	176000	over at vognetwork.com
176000	178000	and everybody in chat is screaming
178000	179000	Man, turn it on, turn it on
179000	181000	We're having two hosts tonight
181000	183000	Alan, I know we talked last week about
183000	184000	It's his birthday
184000	185000	Happy birthday, Alan
185000	186000	If you're out there listening from work
186000	187000	where he's at right now
187000	189000	I was going to forward you a picture
189000	191000	but I couldn't do it on my phone
191000	193000	I'm totally off topic here, but
193000	194000	No, that's fine
194000	195000	Help me fill time
195000	197000	There was a killer tattoo that I saw
197000	200000	that was a Golden Girls tattoo
200000	202000	What? A Golden Girls tattoo?
202000	204000	A Golden Girls tattoo
204000	206000	I was like, man, Rob would have to get that
206000	208000	What was it of? Be Arthur?
208000	209000	It was of all of them
209000	210000	All of them, and it said
210000	212000	Thank you for being a friend underneath it
212000	214000	It was great
214000	215000	I like that
215000	217000	It was on Facebook
217000	219000	But yeah, that was hilarious
219000	222000	So, um, yeah, lots of soda
222000	224000	See, I was almost gonna, I left early
224000	226000	I was like, okay, I'm gonna go get something
226000	228000	I normally get because, you know,
228000	229000	I have this extra time now
229000	232000	So I thought about, well, I could go to In-N-Out
232000	234000	But I really don't like In-N-Out that much
234000	237000	I mean, everyone loves their fries
237000	238000	But I think they taste like crap
238000	241000	They taste like a little, I don't know, it's
241000	244000	Not crispy enough, I guess
244000	245000	Not enough salt
245000	247000	They're very natural with their fries
247000	248000	And I don't like that
248000	251000	I want it to taste artificial and salty
251000	255000	Alright, live listeners, it's all better
255000	257000	You can check in now at vognetwork.com
257000	258000	Sorry about that
258000	259000	Things are gonna be a little broken tonight
259000	262000	Because to hosting it, we kind of have to
262000	264000	I don't get as many little breaks while
264000	266000	Dark Soccer's talking or whatever
266000	268000	And we couldn't scrounge up a third host fast enough
268000	270000	As I was saying, Alan worked today
270000	274000	Although, to be fair, it was his choice
274000	276000	Because his boss said, you know, you want the day off
276000	277000	It's your birthday, whatever
277000	281000	And Alan was like, oh, no, I want to make money on my birthday
281000	282000	Sounds good
282000	283000	Sounds good to me, right?
283000	284000	So there you go
284000	285000	Which, I don't know if I'm supposed to say this
285000	286000	But I'm gonna
286000	289000	His boss, you know who his boss is?
289000	291000	His boss is Jessica Harper from Understadation Live
291000	292000	Really?
292000	293000	Yeah, they work together
293000	294000	Isn't that funny?
294000	295000	That's awesome
295000	299000	I know, it's like the VoG family at work and online
299000	301000	So that's pretty funny
301000	302000	I don't know if I was supposed to say that
302000	303000	But oops, I have a big mouth
303000	304000	Sorry about that
304000	305000	Happy birthday
305000	308000	Alright, anyhow
308000	311000	Usually we get into talking about our gaming weeks
311000	315000	But I want to do a kickoff topic beforehand as we usually do
315000	319000	And I want to kind of address the pink elephant story in gaming
319000	323000	You know, we know we're not breaking news to you here on Orange Lounge Radio
323000	325000	But one thing we like to do is kind of present the news
325000	327000	Put it on the table and talk about it a little bit
327000	330000	One of the big things that has everybody talking this week is
330000	331000	Gaikai, right?
331000	334000	Because Gaikai got bought by Sony
334000	336000	And, you know, I know there's some more with that
336000	338000	That's gonna come up a little later in the show
338000	340000	But let's talk about kind of that first step there
340000	342000	Because Sony has bought Gaikai
342000	343000	Why, Loki?
343000	347000	Why did Sony feel they needed to buy Gaikai?
347000	350000	For streaming games, I mean, that could be useful
350000	354000	They've got a lot of, you know, Sony is an electronics manufacturer
354000	360000	They have laptops, TVs, tablets, phones
360000	366000	So they want a way to stream the Sony or PlayStation brand
366000	368000	To all those devices at the same time
368000	373000	Maybe somehow make them connected more with the PlayStation console
373000	375000	Or just tying everything together
375000	377000	I think that's a good way to do it
377000	379000	Is just, you know, with a streaming platform
379000	382000	You know, I think I've made this comparison before
382000	384000	And I may not have said it on the show
384000	386000	But I totally thought it, which counts on the internet
386000	388000	And that is that the whole
388000	390000	Sony has been doing a little bit of that streaming
390000	393000	With the whole PlayStation 3 to the PSP
393000	395000	Even before the Vita technology
395000	397000	Where you could, you know, remember
397000	398000	I've brought this up on the show before
398000	399000	But if you're a new listener or whatever
399000	402000	It's one of the best hidden features
402000	404000	That will really surprise you about the PSP
404000	408000	Is that that whole Wii U technology has existed
408000	410000	I'm not dogging Nintendo
410000	412000	I realize Nintendo is going to try and perfect that with the Wii U
412000	413000	That's fine
413000	416000	But that technology to stream from your console
416000	419000	Has kind of been there with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP
419000	423000	Granted, you're not streaming the full PlayStation 3 game
423000	425000	That is not what's happening yet
425000	427000	Although maybe this guy kind of purchases
427000	429000	Well, and it's also not just
429000	431000	You could stream like videos and other things
431000	433000	And it's also not just Sony stuff
433000	436000	I mean, you could stream it to pretty much any platform
436000	438000	That would be connected to the internet
438000	441000	So, I mean, you could really stream it to like
441000	444000	Android tablets or an iPad or whatever
444000	447000	And so that's kind of, I could see them being interested in that
447000	451000	Or, hey, they could even be just improving their streaming technology
451000	454000	So that they can stream more sophisticated things to the Vita
454000	458000	You know, maybe PlayStation 4 type graphics or whatever
458000	462000	Not necessarily graphics, because obviously you can't push that through the Vita
462000	466000	But, you know, more intricate games that are going to have complicated graphics and stuff
466000	468000	To those devices
468000	471000	A little easier than you did with the PlayStation 3
471000	475000	And you can also do that PSP PS3 integration through the internet
475000	476000	If I remember correctly
476000	479000	You can actually, like, I could be at a friend's house
479000	482000	Get into their Wi-Fi, turn on my PlayStation 3 at home
482000	484000	And get whatever I need on there
484000	488000	Although that's really limited to, I mean, video
488000	490000	You know, I wouldn't try to stream a game off of there
490000	493000	Like a PS1 game or anything, because the lag would be crazy
493000	496000	Can you imagine trying to play, like, Umjama Lamy over to that connection?
496000	497000	Nope
497000	499000	Although that might be a fun challenge
499000	504000	But, I mean, just the fact that I can, like, look at my home setup
504000	506000	On my home PlayStation 3 and my crossbar
506000	507000	Is kind of cool
507000	512000	Like, it's a nerdy, whoa, Keanu Reeves meme moment, you know?
512000	513000	Yeah
513000	518000	So, I'd be very curious of PlayStation trying to perfect that technology
518000	521000	What about, you know, one thing I've been kind of thinking about is that
521000	525000	PlayStation Plus, they like to do these demos
525000	527000	The 60 minute demos of the games
527000	530000	But right now you have to pretty much download the whole darn game to your drive
530000	532000	In order to just play 60 minutes of it
532000	534000	I mean, for some people, depending on your connection
534000	537000	It takes longer to download the demo than it does that you actually get to play the demo
537000	541000	Maybe they're looking into Gaikai technology to stream demos
541000	545000	I mean, that would certainly be a great use for it that they could probably implement ASAP
545000	548000	Uh, it's possible that they were looking at doing that
548000	550000	I mean, they could do a bunch of different things
550000	552000	I just don't know
552000	555000	I don't know, I don't know what they're really doing with it yet, I mean
555000	558000	How do you, and let me pose this question to chat as well
558000	560000	And I'm behind on some chat comments
560000	562000	In fact, let me read a couple right here even though they're on other topics
562000	565000	But I don't want to ignore our chatroom at chat.
565000	567000	Excuse me, live.vognetwork.com
567000	569000	But AcidicVampire says
569000	571000	I don't drink soda much, water or iced tea
571000	574000	You know, there's a lot of people that
574000	576000	You know, when you drink soda a lot
576000	578000	It's kind of like one of the first things you kick
578000	580000	When you decide you're going on a diet or whatever
580000	583000	And it can be effective, like, I stopped drinking Mountain Dew once
583000	585000	I lost like 10 pounds alone
585000	588000	Yeah, I could do that, but I'm not
588000	590000	ImmortalKing in our chatroom says
590000	592000	Give yourselves credit, you've made a lot of exclusives
592000	595000	Well, alright, maybe a few here or there
595000	597000	There may have been some like a week or two ago
597000	599000	Regarding a new console or anything
599000	600000	Perhaps, perhaps
600000	602000	But we don't talk about that kind of stuff
602000	604000	Because everyone's going to forget it anyways
604000	606000	And BobbyBlackWolf saves the day saying
606000	608000	chat.vognetwork.com, which I almost said
608000	611000	That will work too, so you can use live or chat
611000	613000	It's the same darn thing
613000	616000	But let me pose this question to you and pose this to the chat
616000	618000	Going back to Gaikai a little bit
618000	621000	How would you feel if they came out and said
621000	624000	And I know this probably is not going to happen, disclaimer
624000	627000	But how would you feel anyway if they came out and said
627000	631000	And on the Playstation 4, we're not going to have discs anymore
631000	634000	You're going to buy your games in your virtual library
634000	636000	But you'll be able to stream them on demand
636000	639000	And we hear that that's your option for the next console
639000	642000	It's basically a Gaikai slash on-live slash whatever console
642000	644000	How would you feel about that?
644000	646000	Would you still be on board with gaming or would you be out?
646000	649000	Absolutely would not be buying that console
649000	652000	Because I don't want to have to fucking deal with that shit
652000	654000	And when you say fucking deal with that shit
654000	656000	Is it just you're pissed because you won't be able to
656000	659000	Rampantly mod things like you've been able to do before
659000	661000	I mean, it kind of puts the kibosh on all of that
661000	664000	No, not even at all, it's just I have to stream stuff
664000	666000	I mean, I have an internet connection one day
666000	669000	Or, you know, who knows?
669000	672000	I mean, the internet's not always reliable
672000	674000	Or I should say your internet connection's not always reliable
674000	677000	That's very true, we ran into that a couple weeks ago on the show
677000	681000	So, I mean, I don't really
681000	685000	I mean, it's fun to play, you know, let's imagine a world
685000	687000	That this actually is going to happen
687000	689000	But it's never going to happen because they built a monster
689000	692000	That exists out there, that is their market share
692000	694000	And there's no fucking way of getting rid of it
694000	697000	Because honestly, you know, if they decided
697000	700000	Hey, we're going to put out a console
700000	703000	It's only going to be able to stream games
703000	705000	You're not going to be able to buy it at the stores
705000	708000	Then games will be like, who the fuck's going to sell your console?
708000	710000	Your accessories, your points cards
710000	713000	Oh, that shit, your video cables
713000	716000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, now you need us?
716000	719000	Oh, and you're not going to give us any of that software money?
719000	722000	Well, fuck you guys, good luck selling your console on your own
722000	724000	And that's honestly the situation that's going to be in
724000	727000	Because there's no money to be had in
727000	729000	Definitely no money to be had in consoles
729000	732000	And definitely no money to be had in
732000	735000	At least not much money to be had in accessories
735000	737000	So it's got to come all from the games
737000	741000	And even though the profit margin in games aren't that great either
741000	744000	But still, people trade in stuff
744000	746000	And there's no use market
746000	749000	So that's basically going to be taking away the money from
749000	753000	The largest retailer for video games
753000	757000	And I'm sorry, but they kind of control what people do
757000	760000	And so as much as all these companies want to go all digital
760000	762000	It's not going to fucking happen
762000	765000	Definitely a lot of negative reaction to my question in chat
765000	767000	Which I kind of expected, I think we all did
767000	772000	But a lot of the reasoning focusing on the maintenance of your connection
772000	775000	That you can't always trust your internet connection to be stable
775000	777000	Which I can definitely support
777000	781000	AcidicVampire says, if it's streaming, what if your net connection slows down
781000	783000	Therefore your game stutters? Yes
783000	786000	Reginator says, I want systems with optical storage
786000	788000	If only due to backwards compatibility
788000	791000	Reimu says, suppose you can't connect to the internet
791000	795000	GameGuru says, screw that, I'll just stick with Steam then
795000	797000	Interesting point about PC gaming
797000	800000	I mean, streaming's been available on PC for a bit now
800000	802000	And it certainly hasn't killed Steam
802000	804000	Not by a long shot
804000	808000	They can do that as another option
808000	811000	To say, hey you know what, you can either download your game
811000	813000	Or you can stream it instead
813000	818000	And that's cool that adding options is not a bad thing
818000	821000	But completely removing all other physical options
821000	823000	Because you want to have control over the content
823000	825000	And make sure that there's no piracy
825000	828000	And also making sure that
828000	832000	I don't know, whatever other reasons it has
832000	835000	So that they have all the money, profit from it
835000	837000	It's just, it's not going to work
837000	840000	Let me read a couple other very strong comments from chat
840000	843000	MegaBoyX says, I will never buy a system
843000	846000	Unless I can own physical copies of the games
846000	849000	Which, you know, some people want that type of control
849000	851000	You technically don't own those, but you know
851000	853000	Yeah, we could get into that whole thing
853000	856000	But I mean, Alan, remember I plugged DBA
856000	857000	Or Alan was here on the show last week
857000	859000	And he plugged Zebay's auctions
859000	860000	And I plugged them on Twitter and stuff
860000	863000	He made decent money off those sales last week
863000	865000	I mean, they were old Game Boy Advance games
865000	867000	But apparently some of them are very hard to come by
867000	868000	Especially in other countries
868000	869000	So he did pretty well off that
869000	874000	So, you know, being able to resell your games
874000	875000	When you need a little cash
875000	878000	I think is something we all kind of like to have
878000	879000	That kind of investment there
879000	882000	I guess maybe it's like leasing a car versus buying a car
882000	883000	I don't know
883000	886000	Let me read the most blunt comment in chat, though
886000	887000	I want to talk about this for a minute
887000	890000	Blender at live.vognetwork.com says
890000	894000	They do that, Sky, and I'm done gaming
894000	897000	That's probably the bluntest comment I've seen
897000	900000	But I can't say I blame him
900000	902000	Like...
902000	903000	Go ahead
903000	904000	Okay, I just...
904000	909000	Not to sound like real, like, disastrous
909000	911000	Or dramatic or whatever
911000	916000	But I've often wondered if that's what's ultimately gonna cause the end of OLR
916000	919000	Especially when I see these stories about, you know,
919000	921000	Xbox will prevent used game sales
921000	923000	PlayStation gets Gaikai
923000	925000	And maybe will stream only
925000	926000	Although they probably won't
926000	928000	And all this other stuff, you know, I sometimes wonder
928000	930000	I wonder if there's gonna be another video game crash
930000	932000	And we're just gonna stop being fans of gaming
932000	935000	And that's ultimately what's gonna probably end the show
935000	937000	No, that's not gonna happen at all
937000	938000	And here's why it's not gonna happen
938000	941000	Because, you know, all that's gonna mean
941000	944000	You know, just because a console fails
944000	945000	Or an idea fails
945000	948000	Doesn't mean the whole industry's just gonna go belly up
948000	949000	I mean, look at it
949000	951000	Let's say the PlayStation 4 actually
951000	953000	Let's say Sony is stupid enough to actually say
953000	955000	Okay, we're gonna make this console streaming only
955000	957000	Well, you've got other console manufacturers
957000	959000	That don't necessarily have to follow that
959000	962000	And, you know, we know that the Wii U's not gonna be that way
962000	965000	So, I mean, that's just stupid right there
965000	967000	So people just won't buy the PlayStation 4 instead
967000	970000	Let's assume that all of them are really dumb
970000	971000	And they all decided to go that way
971000	975000	Well, hey, you know, you don't have to give up gaming
975000	979000	I mean, hello, there are how many generations of fucking game systems
979000	982000	You can't tell me you've played every single fucking game that's in existence
982000	985000	I mean, there's plenty that keep you entertained until you're dead
985000	987000	I mean, seriously, you don't need to
987000	988000	That's true, it's very true
988000	990000	You don't need to buy brand new fucking games
990000	993000	And, hello, you could go play on a PC
993000	995000	Because none of that bullshit's there
995000	998000	Or you could just... indie games
998000	999000	Yeah, indie games
999000	1002000	I mean, there's a ton of shit out there that you can be playing
1002000	1004000	You don't need to be relying on
1004000	1006000	Well, all these new systems have to be successful
1006000	1010000	Yeah, you won't have these really great games that are on consoles
1010000	1013000	Because you don't want to stream everything, which is fine
1013000	1014000	Because I don't blame you
1014000	1016000	And also, it's not going to work anyways
1016000	1020000	Because why am I going to stream all this content to my system
1020000	1023000	And then hit my bandwidth caps for my internet providers
1023000	1026000	We're just not in a world right now where it's viable to do that
1026000	1030000	Hey, Comcast is up in that cap to 300, apparently
1030000	1031000	Ooh, let me put it this way, okay
1031000	1034000	I could be rampantly pirating for an entire month
1034000	1036000	And I wouldn't hit that cap, okay
1036000	1042000	I mean, it's a large cap, but I haven't ever done, like, streaming constantly
1042000	1044000	With, you know, gaming and stuff
1044000	1046000	And honestly, I don't want to do that
1046000	1048000	I haven't tried it online, maybe I should
1048000	1049000	GameGuru in chat says
1049000	1051000	I don't think there will be another game crash
1051000	1054000	If anything crashes, it will only be the console industry
1054000	1056000	Save Nintendo, who lived through that shit
1056000	1058000	And I think...
1058000	1060000	Nintendo didn't really live through it
1060000	1061000	At least not in America
1061000	1063000	I mean, I can't speak to really Japan
1063000	1065000	But they definitely didn't live through it in America
1065000	1069000	Because the NES wasn't really out when the bottom fell out of the market
1069000	1074000	I mean, that was mainly the Atari 2600 and just the oversaturation of games
1074000	1078000	Especially the quality and the price that really drove things down
1078000	1081000	But, I mean, I could...
1081000	1086000	If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen in this next cycle of consoles that's coming out
1086000	1089000	And it will be bad decisions that cause it to happen
1089000	1092000	But, anyway, don't run around crying, you know,
1092000	1095000	Oh, OLR threatens to end, no, cause funny enough
1095000	1097000	I arrived at a similar conclusion that
1097000	1101000	Well, we could always talk about classic games and food
1101000	1102000	There you go
1102000	1104000	There's never gonna be nothing that we can't...
1104000	1108000	I mean, just because, you know, it's...
1108000	1110000	I mean, let's say the industry crashes
1110000	1111000	What are we gonna have?
1111000	1113000	Just real quick, Black Wolf clarifies
1113000	1115000	The arcade games were out before the crash
1115000	1118000	So, like, Donkey Kong and stuff was out around that time
1118000	1119000	There's plenty of stuff to talk about
1119000	1120000	Anyway
1120000	1121000	There's plenty of stuff
1121000	1122000	When I all of a sudden go,
1122000	1124000	Well, I can't buy a new system
1124000	1125000	I just hate games now
1125000	1127000	I'm just gonna leave
1127000	1128000	We would just have to change the format again
1128000	1130000	But, anyway, I don't...
1130000	1132000	Let's not go further down that road
1132000	1134000	Cause that's not gonna happen for a long time
1134000	1136000	And there are, you know, there are...
1136000	1139000	I'm sure by the time the next E3 rolls around
1139000	1141000	And we actually get to see these consoles and the offerings
1141000	1143000	There'll be a little more excitement
1143000	1144000	At least I hope to hell there are
1144000	1149000	If not, we'll talk about the Playstation 3 and the 360 a little longer
1149000	1151000	They're not gonna go streaming only
1151000	1153000	It's just not gonna happen
1154000	1155000	Alright
1155000	1158000	Live.vognetwork.com again if you want to participate along with the show
1158000	1160000	And offer up your chat comments
1160000	1162000	Let's get into our gaming weeks
1162000	1164000	Going back to the present a little bit
1164000	1167000	Or maybe games, classic games that you've been playing this week
1167000	1170000	Dark Soccer, if she was here, she told me to say this to you listeners
1170000	1173000	She would be talking about Garrus and more Garrus
1173000	1176000	She has been playing more Mass Effect 3
1176000	1179000	I think she's about, she's at least halfway through the game
1179000	1180000	From what she'll be
1180000	1182000	She got to the romance, she did get to romance Garrus again
1182000	1184000	In part 3, I know that
1184000	1186000	Her femshep and Garrus went on their little date
1186000	1191000	And I think she's, it sounds to me like she's about half to two thirds way through the game
1191000	1193000	So hopefully by next week's show
1193000	1195000	Since you know cause she ain't here
1195000	1198000	And she's at home recovering and resting her voice and all that
1198000	1200000	She's playing Mass Effect
1200000	1202000	She'll probably have that stuff beat by next week
1202000	1204000	So we can ask her about the ending
1204000	1206000	Anyway, so I know that's Dark Soccer's gaming week
1206000	1208000	Let's go to Loki's gaming week
1208000	1211000	Well I started off by finishing up playing
1211000	1213000	Ultimate Collector Garage Sale
1213000	1216000	Which is the game that's tied in with that Ready Player One contest
1216000	1218000	Fucking hated that game
1218000	1220000	Ever fired my body so I
1220000	1222000	Wanted to get that out of the way
1222000	1224000	And I did, I finally got the DeLorean in game
1224000	1226000	Got my, you know
1226000	1228000	Leaderboard position
1228000	1231000	And have the new website for the
1231000	1235000	Last challenge which will open up on Wednesday August 1st
1235000	1237000	Well actually technically Tuesday night
1237000	1239000	Cause it's Eastern time
1239000	1244000	Which I've already made plans on how I'm going to tackle that
1244000	1247000	Including staying up all night if I have to
1247000	1250000	Cause that's the one that's actually gonna count
1250000	1253000	Cause right now it doesn't really matter what your position is
1253000	1255000	Even though it was number 14 for the second challenge
1255000	1257000	I was gonna say
1257000	1259000	I heard that you placed like 14
1259000	1262000	So does that mean you're number 14 like overall right now?
1262000	1264000	It doesn't matter, it's just for fun
1264000	1268000	The leaderboard is just how fast you completed the second one
1268000	1271000	But it's really the last one because
1271000	1273000	It's whoever completed the first two challenges
1273000	1276000	And whoever finishes the last one first
1276000	1278000	Is gonna be it
1278000	1281000	And they said it's really hard the last challenge but
1281000	1283000	I mean we'll see
1283000	1287000	I bet it's gonna be something like
1287000	1289000	It's gonna be like Super Meat Boy Hard
1289000	1291000	Or like the Impossible Game
1291000	1294000	Or VVVV but like even harder
1294000	1296000	I hope it is something like that
1296000	1298000	Cause I've actually played quite a bit of that stuff
1298000	1300000	I bet it's gonna be one of those style of games
1300000	1303000	That's gonna just make you wanna poke your eyeball out like
1303000	1304000	I don't care that'd be fun
1304000	1306000	And you know what I'd rather have it be that
1306000	1308000	Than wanting to poke my eyeballs out
1308000	1310000	For playing that stupid Ultimate Collector thing
1310000	1312000	Which is so goddamn boring
1312000	1313000	There is a trick to it I mean
1313000	1316000	You just have to get a lot of friends on Facebook
1316000	1318000	That are playing that
1318000	1320000	And so I did that and
1320000	1322000	You know I was able to
1322000	1324000	Cause you can send energy to each other
1324000	1328000	And that's how you can do it without having to pay anything
1328000	1330000	I have to play this a little bit
1330000	1332000	Cause this is a link that
1332000	1334000	Alan sent me on my Facebook this week
1334000	1336000	It's off of Tumblr and it's credited
1336000	1338000	The source is KidXForever
1338000	1340000	I have no idea it's Tumblr
1340000	1342000	I can never tell how this works and who gets credit for it
1342000	1344000	But here you go
1344000	1347000	It's somebody playing the impossible game
1347000	1349000	And giving their commentary
1349000	1352000	And this is what I picture Loki is gonna sound like
1352000	1354000	During that final gate competition
1354000	1356000	Oh it says Achievement Hunter
1356000	1358000	Oh yeah it's that Rooster Teeth thing
1358000	1360000	Oh okay then there you go it's Rooster Teeth
1360000	1362000	So here you go
1362000	1364000	Let me play a little bit of this here if I can
1366000	1368000	So they're hopping along to the bricks
1368000	1372000	He'll fuck up here in a minute
1376000	1378000	That looks pretty hard
1378000	1380000	That's probably the type of thing you're gonna have to play
1380000	1382000	FUCK!
1382000	1384000	Holy shit this is way harder than the original
1384000	1386000	This is like two seconds
1386000	1388000	This is the beginning of the fucking level
1388000	1390000	And it's like double spikes, triple spikes
1390000	1392000	Fucking shit you gotta jump over
1392000	1394000	It's fast as fuck too
1394000	1398000	Damn it! Come on you fuck, come on you fuck
1398000	1400000	JUMP- GOD DAMN IT MOTHERFUCKER
1400000	1402000	I always fuck up that last part
1402000	1404000	By last part I mean the end of the very first fucking-
1404000	1406000	Okay the video goes on like that for like five minutes
1406000	1408000	But that's totally gonna be you that night
1408000	1410000	Playing that game
1410000	1412000	GOD DAMN IT
1412000	1414000	They just fucking did this so they don't have to fucking give the DeLorean away
1414000	1416000	Mother fuckers
1416000	1418000	First that fucking Facebook game and now this shit
1418000	1420000	On top of the DeLorean thing
1420000	1422000	Let's just, you know
1422000	1424000	Let's say I won that thing
1424000	1426000	I'd have to still fucking drive to L.A.
1426000	1428000	And pay the taxes
1428000	1430000	And pay whatever goddamn registration
1430000	1432000	Insurance
1432000	1434000	All that shit
1434000	1436000	It sounds like a big pain in the ass actually
1436000	1438000	But I still wanna win
1438000	1440000	Cause who doesn't wanna win?
1440000	1442000	Who doesn't wanna win? Exactly
1442000	1444000	Speaking of which, that reminds me actually
1444000	1450000	There's a Call of Duty 3 tournament down here in Stockton
1450000	1452000	One of my customers is actually having it
1452000	1454000	And I need to find someone to play with me
1454000	1456000	Cause none of my friends wanna go
1456000	1458000	And that kinda sucks
1458000	1460000	Anyone that listens that's in Sacramento
1460000	1462000	That happens to be somewhat good at
1462000	1464000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
1464000	1466000	Hey, you might be interested in
1466000	1468000	And that ain't me
1468000	1470000	You know, interested in going down
1470000	1472000	See, cause I thought my old coworker might wanna do it
1472000	1474000	But he has his kids, you know, they're divorced
1474000	1476000	And they're shared custody
1476000	1478000	So he has his kids on that Saturday
1478000	1480000	Cause we'd fucking tear that shit up
1480000	1482000	Wait, so you have to have like a partner?
1482000	1484000	Yeah, so I think it's a two on two
1484000	1486000	So if you wanna team up with Loki
1486000	1488000	You gotta be local though
1488000	1490000	You gotta be local
1490000	1492000	And don't be scary
1492000	1494000	Yeah, Stockton's scary enough
1494000	1496000	We don't need any scary people
1496000	1498000	Meeting me down there
1498000	1500000	At least that's what I'm thinking right now
1500000	1502000	I haven't really discussed with the wife yet
1502000	1504000	But you know
1504000	1506000	Well, cause I wanted to see if I could even get someone
1506000	1508000	Cause you know, what's the point
1508000	1510000	Me just going down there
1510000	1512000	But it might be fun
1512000	1514000	There's cash prizes involved
1514000	1516000	Don't know if there's that many people
1516000	1518000	Anyways, so other things to play this week
1518000	1520000	Minecraft
1520000	1522000	Playing Minecraft a lot
1522000	1524000	I finally got the achievement for On a Rail
1524000	1526000	Cause my rail system goes really far
1526000	1528000	The other thing though
1528000	1530000	Is I'm not sure how
1530000	1532000	Bobby was talking about that he got that achievement too
1532000	1534000	And I was wondering in the back of my mind
1534000	1536000	He did not
1536000	1538000	Cause I didn't know he was building a big rail system
1538000	1540000	He has an underwater rail system
1540000	1542000	I actually saw there was a Minecraft thread
1542000	1544000	On the VoG forum that I saw his thing
1544000	1546000	No, but mine actually goes really
1546000	1548000	Like all around the world
1548000	1550000	I'm gonna get the achievement by just going to Loki's world
1550000	1552000	That's fine, come on in
1552000	1554000	I'm redoing the whole mine cart thing
1554000	1556000	Cause before I used to have it where you push the switch
1556000	1558000	And it would call the mine cart
1558000	1560000	It just doesn't work now
1560000	1562000	I was gonna have the mine carts just traveling around
1562000	1564000	But I ran into a problem
1564000	1566000	Where I accidentally
1566000	1568000	I was trying to get into one of my mine carts
1568000	1570000	And it caught one of the powered rails
1570000	1572000	And just kept going
1572000	1574000	So I'm like, oh that's fine, I'll just catch up with it at the end
1574000	1576000	And it never appeared
1576000	1578000	So I'm like, does the game just lose track of these mine carts
1578000	1580000	Cause that's gonna fuck up my entire system
1580000	1582000	If I have these mine carts going around they just disappear
1582000	1584000	Because, oh it's too far away
1584000	1586000	That might be a problem
1586000	1588000	I don't know what I'm gonna do there
1588000	1590000	That's an issue
1590000	1592000	But yeah, it's been fun playing that
1592000	1594000	And a little bit of Modern Warfare 3
1594000	1596000	Let's play a little bit of that
1596000	1598000	Bobby says the one that he built was actually above ground
1598000	1600000	He couldn't get the underwater one to go long enough
1600000	1602000	So there you go
1602000	1604000	Alright, anything else you wanna share with your gaming week?
1604000	1606000	Ah, that's it
1606000	1608000	My gaming week, I've actually still been playing
1608000	1610000	More Final Fantasy 11
1610000	1612000	It's kinda what I've been playing instead of WoW
1612000	1614000	Cause there's really nothing to do in WoW right now
1614000	1616000	Unless I wanna level in alt
1616000	1618000	So I'm really kinda just burned out on it
1618000	1620000	Playing with friends a little bit has been Final Fantasy
