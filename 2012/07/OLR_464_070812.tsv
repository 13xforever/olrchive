10092	18577	Tonight, July 8, 2012, Sony purchases Gaikai, what does this mean for retail?

31638	36861	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36981	39082	It's Orange Lounge Radio.
39562	47486	We are live, as we always are, Sunday nights at the Voice of Geeks or VOG Network, www.vognetwork.com.
47526	53930	Sunday nights, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Mr. Bobby Blackwolf and his fantastic show.
54390	55111	Also on the network.
55871	57432	If you are listening to us live...
57952	60674	Get your butt in our chat room and participate so we can read your comments.
60834	66698	Live.VogNetwork.com We always appreciate you guys participating along with our show.
67439	68059	I said your show.
68079	68779	It is your show too.
68880	69620	It's all of our shows.
70781	74884	We do like to bill ourselves as the show where every gamer has a voice.
75424	75844	TechMasterLoki
96196	96917	I'm doing good.
97537	97797	Yeah?
98358	98518	Yeah.
98718	100079	Just, alright, it's all good?
100099	103501	I'm full now because I've had like a liter of root beer.
103521	104982	That is a lot of soda.
105302	118171	What did you think about, not to get all political on this show, but since, you know, I know a lot of gamers and I know a lot of gamers that drink soda, there was a lot of feedback to that whole New York City law that they were talking about where they were going to ban the supersized drinks and all that.
118211	119052	What did you think about that?
120575	123037	I don't even understand why that's a problem.
123057	124839	I somehow knew in my mind that's exactly what you'd say.
125039	128082	Maybe having done this show with you for 10 years and knowing you about us long is probably...
145938	147038	I can predict these things
164523	167204	for 10 years and knowing you about as long as probably.
167224	167764	Feedback, sorry.
168744	169644	I am not with it tonight.
169684	171005	Two hosting the show tonight.
171565	172385	I'm not with it.
173105	179247	I forgot to enable the live check-ins over at vognetwork.com and everybody in chat is screaming, turn it on, turn it on.
179267	180347	We're having two hosts tonight.
180867	183328	Alan, I know we talked last week about it's his birthday.
183348	187129	So happy birthday, Alan, if you're out there listening from work where he's at right now.
187509	189991	I was going to forge you a picture, but I couldn't do it on my phone.
190291	192273	I'm totally off topic here.
192433	193094	No, that's fine.
193134	194515	Help me fill time while I set up the chickens.
194535	199719	There was a killer tattoo that I saw that was a Golden Girls tattoo.
199980	200320	What?
200420	201741	A Golden Girls tattoo?
201761	202982	A Golden Girls tattoo.
203002	205845	I was like, man, Rob would have to get that.
206185	206965	What was it of?
206986	208527	It was of all of them.
208787	209107	All of them.
209287	211709	It said, thank you for being a friend underneath it.
211790	212610	It was great.
214292	214852	I like that.
214872	215773	It was on Facebook.
217093	218313	But yeah, that was hilarious.
218613	221774	So, um... Yeah, lots of soda.
222054	223995	See, I was almost gonna... I left early.
224215	229216	I was like, okay, I'm gonna go get something different than what I normally get because, you know, I have this extra time now.
229697	234418	So, I thought about, well, I could go to In-N-Out, but I really don't like In-N-Out that much.
234818	238359	I mean, it's... Everyone loves their fries, but I think they taste like crap.
238399	241180	They taste like little... I don't know, it's...
241960	243864	Not crispy enough, I guess.
244145	244806	Not enough salt.
245006	248433	They're very natural with their fries, and I don't like that.
248593	250878	I want it to taste artificial and salty.
252481	254943	All right, live listeners, it's all better.
254983	256924	You can check in now at vognetwork.com.
256964	257505	Sorry about that.
257825	267992	Things are going to be a little broken tonight because two hosting it, we kind of have to... I don't get as many little breaks while DarkSakura's talking or whatever, and we couldn't scrounge up a third host fast enough.
268372	270153	As I was saying, Alan worked today.
270294	271895	Although, to be fair...
272615	273536	It was his choice.
273956	275858	Because his boss said, you know, you want the day off?
275878	276739	It's your birthday, whatever.
277519	280542	And Alan was like, oh, no, I want to make money on my birthday.
280722	282784	So it sounds good to me, right?
283144	283705	So there you go.
283945	286347	Which I don't know if I'm supposed to say this, but I'm going to.
286567	287768	His boss, you know who his boss is?
289029	291031	His boss is Jessica Harper from Under Sedation Live.
291532	291852	Really?
291892	292793	Yeah, they work together.
292813	293493	Isn't that funny?
293513	294054	That's awesome.
294114	294394	I know.
294454	299418	It's like the VOG family at work and online.
299799	300639	So that's pretty funny.
301080	303362	I don't know if I was supposed to say that, but oops, I have a big mouth.
303602	304082	Sorry about that.
304363	304923	Happy birthday.
306244	318292	Alright, anyhow, usually we get into talking about our gaming weeks, but I want to do a kickoff topic beforehand as we usually do, and I want to kind of address the pink elephant story in gaming.
318812	326998	You know, we know we're not breaking news to you here on Orange Lounge Radio, but one thing we like to do is kind of present the news, put it on the table, and talk about it a little bit.
327098	331501	One of the big things that has everybody talking this week is Gaikai, right?
331541	333262	Because Gaikai got bought by Sony, right?
334383	341327	and, you know, I know there's some more with that that's going to come up a little later in the show, but let's talk about kind of that first step there where Sony has bought Gaikai.
342068	342688	Why, Loki?
342788	345810	Why did Sony feel they needed to buy Gaikai?
346811	349712	For streaming games, I mean, that could be useful.
349792	353855	They've got a lot of... You know, Sony is an electronics manufacturer.
353895	359619	They have laptops, TVs, tablets, phones...
360459	368125	So they want a way to stream the Sony or PlayStation brand to all those devices at the same time.
368205	375090	Maybe somehow make them connected more with the PlayStation console or just tying everything together.
375250	376471	I think that's a good way to do it.
377372	378453	With a streaming platform.
379993	386495	I think I've made this comparison before, and I may not have said it on the show, but I totally thought it, which counts on the internet.
388056	400100	Sony has been doing a little bit of that streaming with the whole PlayStation 3 to the PSP, even before the Vita technology, where you could remember, and I know I've brought this up on the show before, but if you're a new listener or whatever, it's one of the...
400600	408187	Best hidden features that will really surprise you about the PSP is that that whole Wii U technology has existed.
408508	410049	I'm not dogging Nintendo.
410069	412852	I realize Nintendo's going to try and perfect that with the Wii U. That's fine.
413192	419638	But that technology to stream from your console has kind of been there with the PlayStation 3 and the PSP.
419738	422881	Granted, you're not streaming the full PlayStation 3 game.
423181	424703	That is not what's happening.
425463	427144	I can see them being interested in that.
427184	430686	Or, hey, they could even be just improving their streaming technology so that...
452077	452637	Thanks for watching!
472049	495554	and you can also do that PSP PS3 integration through the internet if I remember correctly you can actually yeah like I could be at a friend's house get into their Wi-Fi turn on my PlayStation 3 at home and get whatever I need on there although that's really limited to I mean video you know I wouldn't try to stream a game off there like a PS1 game or anything because the lag would be crazy you imagine trying to play like Oom Jam Alami over to that connection
495934	496054	Nope.
496094	496955	True, yeah.
497035	498316	Although that might be a fun challenge.
499316	506942	But, I mean, just the fact that I can, like, look at my home setup on my home PlayStation 3 in my crossbar is kind of cool.
507022	512345	Like, it's a nerdy, whoa, Keanu Reeves meme moment, you know?
512546	512766	Yeah.
513606	518049	So, I'd be very curious of PlayStation trying to perfect that technology.
518410	522492	What about, you know, one thing I've been kind of thinking about is that PlayStation Plus...
523553	526474	They like to do these demos, the 60-minute demos of the games.
526794	532035	But right now you have to pretty much download the whole darn game to your drive in order to just play 60 minutes of it.
532075	536957	I mean, for some people, depending on your connection, it takes longer to download the demo than it does to actually get to play the demo.
537377	541158	Maybe they're looking into Gaikai technology to stream demos.
541538	545099	I mean, that would certainly be a great use for it that they could probably implement ASAP.
546009	548052	It's possible that they were looking at doing that.
548092	550136	I mean, they could do a bunch of different things.
550296	551138	I just don't know.
552500	552821	I don't know.
552941	554343	I don't know what they're really doing with it yet.
554464	554684	I mean...
556222	558184	And let me pose this question to chat as well.
558204	559805	And I'm behind on some chat comments.
559845	562446	In fact, let me read a couple right here even though they're on other topics.
562486	567109	But I don't want to ignore our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
567489	571252	But Acidic Vampire says, I don't drink soda much, water, or iced tea.
571612	579797	You know, there's a lot of people that when you drink soda a lot, it's kind of like one of the first things you kick when you decide you're going on a diet or whatever.
579837	580858	And it can be effective.
580958	582759	Like I stopped drinking Mountain Dew once.
582819	584260	I lost like 10 pounds alone.
584420	587342	Yeah, I could do that, but I'm not.
588142	590684	ImmortalKing in our chatroom says, Give yourselves credit.
590704	592165	You've made a lot of exclusives.
592345	592906	Well, all right.
593686	594647	Maybe a few here or there.
595167	598970	There may have been some like a week or two ago regarding a new console or anything.
599010	599970	Perhaps.
600330	603793	But we don't talk about that kind of stuff because everyone's going to forget it anyways.
603933	609617	And BobbyBlackWolf saves the day saying, Chat.VogNetwork.com, which I almost said, that will work too.
609757	611258	So you can use live or chat.
611338	612999	It's the same darn thing.
613659	617340	But let me pose this question to you and pose this to the chat, going back to Gaikai a little bit.
618160	631023	How would you feel if they came out and said, and I know this probably is not going to happen, disclaimer, but how would you feel anyway if they came out and said, and on the PlayStation 4, we're not going to have discs anymore.
631363	636204	You're going to buy your games in your virtual library, but you'll be able to stream them on demand.
636484	639184	And we hear that that's your option for the next console.
639404	642425	It's basically a Gaikai slash on live slash whatever console.
642845	643968	How would you feel about that?
644308	646372	Would you still be on board with gaming or would you be out?
647054	651442	Absolutely would not be buying that console because I don't want to have to fucking deal with that shit
653292	659935	And when you say fucking deal with that shit, is it just you're pissed because you won't be able to rampantly mod things like you've been able to do before?
659975	661735	I mean, it kind of puts the kibosh on all of that.
662075	662956	No, not even at all.
662996	664917	It's just I have to, you know, stream stuff.
664977	669158	I mean, I have an internet connection one day or, you know, who knows?
669418	671759	I mean, the internet's not always reliable.
672619	674580	I should say your internet connection's not always reliable.
674780	675781	That's very true.
675881	677861	We ran into that a couple weeks ago on the show.
677881	678422	So, I mean...
679842	694381	I don't really... I mean, it's fun to play, you know, let's imagine a world that this actually is going to happen, but it's never going to happen because they built a monster that exists out there that is their market share and there's no fucking way of getting rid of it.
694742	697305	Because, honestly, you know, if they decided, hey...
698186	702928	We're gonna put out a console that's only gonna be able to stream games.
703108	704889	You're not gonna be able to buy it at the stores.
705089	707650	The games will be like, who the fuck's gonna sell your console?
707830	712992	Your accessories, your points cards, all of that shit, your video cables.
713612	713732	Oh!
714332	716113	Oh, oh, oh, now you need us?
716613	718734	Oh, and you're not going to give us any of that software money?
718814	719875	Well, fuck you guys.
720235	721736	Good luck selling your console on your own.
722117	734644	And that's honestly the situation that's going to be in because there's definitely no money to be had in consoles and definitely not much money to be had in accessories.
735125	737066	So it's got to come all from the games.
737806	741509	And even though the profit margin in games aren't that great either, but...
742149	742590	Thanks for watching!
762723	766264	Definitely a lot of negative reaction to my question in chat, which I kind of expected.
766304	767064	I think we all did.
767124	776927	But a lot of the reasoning focusing on the maintenance of your connection, that you can't always trust your internet connection to be stable, which I can definitely support.
777407	782248	Acidic Vampire says, if it's streaming, what if your net connection slows down, therefore your game stutters?
782328	782568	Yes.
783729	788270	Ragenator says, I want systems with optical storage if only due to backwards compatibility.
788690	791213	Raymu says, suppose you can't connect to the internet.
791853	794896	GameGuru says, screw that, I'll just stick with Steam then.
795317	797259	Interesting point about PC gaming.
797739	801804	I mean, streaming's been available on PC for a bit now and it certainly hasn't killed Steam.
802845	803745	Not by a long shot.
803906	804787	It's just, they're gonna...
805967	809929	They can do that as another option to say, hey, you know what?
809969	814251	You can either download your game or you can stream it instead.
815151	828236	That's cool that adding options is not a bad thing, but completely removing all other physical options because you want to have control over the content and make sure that there's no piracy and also making sure that
829998	834840	I don't know, whatever other reasons it has so that they have all the money, profit from it.
836321	837342	It's just, it's not going to work.
837842	840563	Let me read a couple other very strong comments from chat.
840683	846046	MegaboyX says, I will never buy a system unless I can own physical copies of the games.
846866	847027	Which...
848267	849368	Some people want that type of control.
849388	851170	You technically don't own those, but you know.
852351	853632	Yeah, we could get into that whole thing.
853692	860358	But I mean, Alan, remember I plugged, or Alan was here on the show last week and he plugged his eBay auctions and I plugged them on Twitter and stuff.
860699	863521	He made decent money off those sales last week.
863601	868246	I mean, they were old Game Boy Advance games, but apparently some of them are very hard to come by, especially in other countries.
868266	869447	So he did pretty well off that.
870167	879191	Um, so, you know, being able to resell your games when you need a little cash, I think is something we all kind of like to have that kind of investment there.
879511	881972	I guess maybe it's like leasing a car versus buying a car.
882993	883273	I don't know.
883733	886194	Uh, let me read the most blunt comment in chat though.
886394	887354	I want to talk about this for a minute.
887374	893497	Blender at live.vognetwork.com says, they do that Sky and I'm done gaming.
895197	900242	That's probably the bluntest comment I've seen, but I can't say I blame him.
902364	903385	Go ahead.
904486	912354	Not to sound real disastrous or dramatic or whatever, but I've often wondered...
912694	934754	If that's what's ultimately going to cause the end of OLR, especially when I see these stories about Xbox will prevent used game sales, PlayStation gets Gaikai and maybe will stream only, although they probably won't, and all this other stuff, I sometimes wonder, I wonder if there's going to be another video game crash, and we're just going to stop being fans of gaming, and that's ultimately what's going to probably end this show.
935612	936892	No, that's not going to happen at all.
936932	938173	And here's why it's not going to happen.
938213	947655	Because, you know, all that's going to mean, you know, just because a console fails or an idea fails doesn't mean the whole industry is just going to go belly up.
948035	948635	I mean, look at it.
949295	955416	Let's say the PlayStation 4 actually... Let's say Sony is stupid enough to actually say, okay, we're going to make this console streaming only.
955636	959257	Well, you've got other console manufacturers that don't necessarily have to follow that.
959397	962178	And, you know, we know that the Wii U is not going to be that way.
962278	963258	So, I mean...
964298	987958	that's just stupid right there so people just won't buy the PlayStation 4 instead let's assume that all of them are really dumb and they all decided to go that way well hey you know you don't have to give up gaming I mean hello there are how many generations of fucking game systems you can't tell me you played every single fucking game that's in existence I mean there's plenty to keep you entertained until you're dead I mean seriously you don't need to it's true it's very
988218	990299	You don't need to buy brand new fucking games.
990479	995040	And hello, you could go play on a PC because none of that bullshit's there.
995160	997761	Or you could just indie games.
998021	999282	Yeah, indie games.
999302	1002043	There's a ton of shit out there that you can be playing.
1002723	1006724	You don't need to be relying on, well, all these new systems have to be successful.
1006804	1013647	Yeah, you won't have these really great games that are on consoles because you don't want to stream everything, which is fine because I don't blame you.
1014207	1016868	And also, it's not going to work anyways because why...
1017868	1022770	Why am I going to stream all this content to my system and then hit my bandwidth caps for my internet providers?
1022870	1026472	We're just not in a world right now where it's viable to do that.
1026592	1028953	Hey, Comcast is up in that cap to 300, apparently.
1029533	1031534	Let me put it this way, okay?
1031714	1036116	I could be rampantly pirating for an entire month and I wouldn't hit that cap, okay?
1036296	1045539	I mean, it's a large cap, but I haven't ever done streaming constantly with gaming and stuff, and honestly, I don't want to do that.
1046020	1046860	I haven't tried it on live.
1047881	1051125	GameGuru in chat says, I don't think there will be another game crash.
1051245	1056371	If anything crashes, it will only be the console industry, save Nintendo, who lived through that shit.
1056751	1061616	And I think Nintendo didn't really live through it, at least not in America.
1061697	1063719	I mean, I can't speak to really Japan, but...
1064099	1064739	And I'll see you next time.
1090566	1094289	Don't run around crying, you know, OLR threatens to end.
1094410	1100295	No, because funny enough, I arrived at a similar conclusion that, well, we could always talk about classic games and food.
1101970	1110619	There's never going to be nothing that we can't... I mean, just because... I mean, let's say the industry crashes.
1110719	1111399	What are we going to have?
1111519	1115383	Just real quick, BlackWolf clarifies the arcade games were out before the crash.
1115443	1118226	So Donkey Kong and stuff was out around that time.
1118246	1119507	There's plenty of stuff to talk about.
1119527	1121128	There's plenty of stuff.
1121188	1121409	When I...
1121849	1124150	All of a sudden go, well, I can't buy a new system.
1124350	1125491	I just hate games now.
1125831	1126852	I'm just going to leave.
1126972	1128633	We would just have to change the format again.
1128653	1133835	But anyway, let's not go further down that road because that's not going to happen for a long time.
1133895	1142860	And there are, you know, I'm sure by the time the next E3 rolls around and we actually get to see these consoles and the offerings, there'll be a little more excitement.
1142900	1144121	At least I hope to hell there are.
1144201	1148183	If not, we'll talk about the PlayStation 3 and the 360 a little longer.
1149110	1150912	They're not going to go streaming only.
1151052	1151993	It's just not going to happen.
1153954	1154214	All right.
1155175	1159499	Live.VogNetwork.com again if you want to participate along with the show and offer up your chat comments.
1160260	1161721	Let's get into our gaming weeks.
1162041	1166465	Going back to the present a little bit or maybe games, classic games that you've been playing this week.
1167386	1170188	DarkSakura, if she was here, she told me to say this to you listeners.
1170549	1173011	She would be talking about Garrus and more Garrus.
1173731	1175873	She has been playing more Mass Effect 3.
1176294	1179696	I think she's at least halfway through the game.
1180157	1182939	She did get to romance Garrus again in Part 3.
1182999	1183440	I know that.
1183480	1185181	Her femshep and Garrus went on their little date.
1186342	1190626	It sounds to me like she's about half to two-thirds way through the game.
1191226	1198693	Hopefully by next week's show, since you know because she ain't here and she's at home recovering and resting her voice and all that, she's playing Mass Effect.
1199273	1203036	She'll probably have that stuff beat by next week, so we can ask her about the ending.
1203136	1203396	Woo!
1203977	1205658	Anyway, so I know that's DarkSakura's Gaming Week.
1205898	1206919	Let's go to Loki's Gaming Week.
1207880	1216346	Well, I started off by finishing up playing Ultimate Collector Garage Sale, which is the game that's tied in with that Ready Player One contest.
1216787	1218128	Fucking hated that game.
1218628	1222711	Ever fired my body, so I wanted to get that out of the way, and I did.
1222992	1226234	I finally got the DeLorean in-game, got my, you know...
1227515	1235403	Leaderboard Position, and have the new website for the last challenge, which will open up on Wednesday, August 1st.
1235444	1250099	Well, actually, technically Tuesday night, because it's Eastern Time, which I've already made plans on how I'm going to tackle that, including staying up all night if I have to, because that's the one that's actually going to count.
1250479	1255583	because right now it doesn't really matter what your position is even though it was number 14 for the second challenge.
1256464	1259086	I was going to say, I heard that you placed like 14.
1259166	1261988	Does that mean you're number 14 overall right now?
1262208	1262789	It doesn't matter.
1263149	1265351	It's just for fun, the leaderboard.
1265391	1267652	It's just how fast you completed the second one.
1269434	1277120	But it's really the last one because it's whoever completed the first two challenges and whoever finishes the last one first is going to be...
1278281	1283345	It, and they said it's really hard, the last challenge, but, I mean, we'll see.
1285787	1294854	I bet it's gonna be something like, it's gonna be like Super Meat Boy Hard, or like The Impossible Game, or VVVV, but like even harder.
1294954	1298217	I hope it is something like that, because I've actually played quite a bit of that stuff.
1298837	1302978	I bet it's going to be one of those style of games that's going to just make you want to poke your eyeball out.
1303098	1303919	I don't care.
1303959	1304399	That'd be fun.
1304599	1305159	And you know what?
1305339	1312162	I'd rather have it be that than wanting to poke my eyeballs out for playing that stupid Ultimate Collector thing, which is so goddamn boring.
1312482	1313302	There is a trick to it.
1313342	1328427	I mean, you just have to get a lot of friends on Facebook that are playing that, and so I did that, and I was able to, because you can send energy to each other, and that's how you can do it without having to pay anything.
1328927	1333969	I have to play this a little bit because this is a link that Alan sent me on my Facebook this week.
1334029	1335990	It's off of Tumblr and it's credited.
1336030	1337730	The source is KidXForever.
1338490	1339011	I have no idea.
1339271	1339871	It's Tumblr.
1339951	1342212	I can never tell how this works and who gets credit for it.
1342712	1344312	But here you go.
1344372	1349394	It's somebody playing the Impossible game and giving their commentary.
1349434	1354396	And this is what I picture Loki is going to sound like during that final gate competition.
1355196	1356356	Oh, it says Achievement Hunter.
1356897	1358157	Yeah, it's a Rooster Teeth thing.
1358337	1358717	Oh, okay.
1358777	1359258	Then there you go.
1359298	1359938	It's Rooster Teeth.
1359958	1362079	So here you go.
1362099	1363480	Let me play a little bit of this here if I can.
1366461	1368142	So they're hopping along to the bricks.
1370723	1371744	He'll fuck up here in a minute.
1372604	1377426	Oh, that's pretty hard.
1378767	1380448	That's probably the type of thing you're going to have to play.
1382279	1384943	Holy shit, this is way harder than the original.
1384983	1385884	This is like two seconds!
1386024	1393435	This is the beginning of the fucking level, and it's like double spikes, triple spikes, fucking shit you gotta jump over, it's fast as fuck too.
1393535	1394416	God damn it!
1394677	1396199	Come on you fuck, come on you fuck.
1398374	1399214	God damn it!
1399294	1400075	Motherfucker!
1400115	1401735	I always fuck up that last part.
1401855	1409438	By last part, I mean the end of the very first fucking- Okay, the video goes on like that for like five minutes, but that's totally gonna be you that night playing that game.
1409798	1410718	God damn it!
1411399	1414740	They just fucking did this so they don't have to fucking give the DeLorean away.
1414820	1415740	Motherfuckers!
1415980	1418301	First that fucking Facebook game and now this shit.
1418661	1423966	Well, on top of the DeLorean thing, let's just, you know, let's say I won that thing.
1424106	1432673	I'd have to still fucking drive to LA and pay the taxes and pay whatever goddamn registration, insurance, all that shit.
1433674	1437438	It sounds like a big pain in the ass, actually, but I still want to win.
1439455	1465789	who doesn't want to win who doesn't want to win exactly speaking of which uh that reminds me actually um uh there's a Call of Duty 3 tournament down here in Stockton um one of my customers is actually having it and I need to find someone to play with me because none of my friends want to go and that kind of sucks so anyone that listens that's in Sacramento that happens to be somewhat good at Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 hey you might be interested in
1466169	1490471	and that ain't me you may you know interesting going down see because I thought my old co-worker might want to but he has his kids you know they're divorced and shared custody so he has his kids on this on that Saturday I'm like ah otherwise we'd fucking tear that shit up but um wait so you have to have like a partner yes I think it's two on two uh so if you want to team up with Loki so this you got to be local though you gotta be local but uh and don't be scary
1492935	1494036	Yeah, Stockton's scary enough.
1494056	1496998	We don't need any scary people, you know, meeting me down there.
1497038	1499640	But, you know, at least that's what I'm thinking right now.
1499980	1502662	I haven't really discussed with the wife yet.
1502742	1506005	But, you know, I... Well, because I wanted to see if I could even get someone.
1506025	1508306	Because, you know, what's the point of me just going down there?
1508326	1510888	But, yeah, it might be fun.
1511168	1512429	There's cash prizes involved.
1512509	1513870	So, you know, it'd be cool.
1514571	1516072	I don't know if there's that many people down there.
1516112	1516833	But, anyways.
1517113	1518093	So, other things to play this week.
1518214	1518754	Minecraft.
1519314	1520815	You know, playing Minecraft a lot.
1520835	1521156	Yeah.
1521796	1526460	I finally got the achievement for On a Rail, because my rail system goes really far.
1526940	1533926	The other thing, though, is I'm not sure how... Bobby was talking about that he got that achievement, too, and I was wondering in the back of my mind, did he go over to Loki's World to do it?
1533946	1534427	No, he did not.
1534567	1535548	Wow, good job, Bobby!
1535568	1538170	Because I didn't know he was building a big rail system.
1538230	1538770	I knew you were.
1538931	1540232	He has an underwater rail system.
1540272	1544075	I actually saw there was a micro thread on the VOG forum that I saw his thing.
1544495	1548881	I'm going to get the achievement by just going to Loki's world.
1563919	1588645	I ran into a problem where I accidentally I was trying to get into one of my minecarts and it just it caught one of the powered rails and just kept going so I'm like oh that's fine I'll just catch up with it at the end and it never appeared so I'm like does the game just lose track of these minecarts because that's gonna fuck up my entire system if I have these minecarts going around they just disappear because oh it's too far away that might be a problem so um I don't know what I'm gonna do there that that's a an issue um
1590805	1592065	But yeah, it's been fun playing that.
1592285	1594806	And then a little bit of Modern Warfare 3.
1595166	1597827	Bobby says the one that he built was actually above ground.
1597867	1599847	He couldn't get the underwater one to go long enough.
1600647	1602208	So there you go.
1602248	1603788	Anything else you want to share with your gaming week?
1604808	1605108	That's it.
1606109	1606809	My gaming week.
1606849	1609089	I've actually still been playing more Final Fantasy XI.
1609269	1614351	It's kind of what I've been playing instead of WoW because there's really nothing to do in WoW right now unless I want to level an alt.
1614831	1616451	So I'm really kind of just burned out on it.
1616471	1619852	So my MMO time and playing with friends a little bit has been Final Fantasy
