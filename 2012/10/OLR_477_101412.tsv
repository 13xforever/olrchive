14263	25514	Tonight, October 14th, 2012, an upcoming holiday game is leaked a month early, Valve is looking for some hardware testers, and could you soon feel temperature in your PlayStation controller?
31519	31919	DarkSakura.com
60018	63119	which I know a lot of you in the chat room might be going, wait a minute, she's right here.
63579	65299	Well, that's the magic of the internet, you see.
65439	66480	She's sick today.
66820	68700	She caught Disneyland plague or something.
68760	69620	She caught the gay.
70081	76702	She went to gay days at Disneyland and wouldn't you know it, she walked away with a horrific case of the gay.
77362	82804	And so she will not be here tonight, but she is in chat if you wish to say hello and feel better and so forth.
83897	87400	Anyhow, with us tonight in studio, we do have Techmaster Loki.
87621	87861	Hi.
88181	88742	How are you, Loki?
88862	89302	I'm alright.
89462	89963	I have a cold.
90263	91584	You have a cold, but it's not the gay.
92125	92865	It's not the gay.
93006	93566	Alright, good.
94407	96208	The gay doesn't make you all stuffed up, I don't think.
97556	106481	I know I sound, I definitely have the gay because I'm sounding a little sick today, but I just blew out my voice over on Friday, but I'll talk about that later.
106921	110582	Anyhow, also say hello to, we have a guest host here.
110983	113384	We love it when he's available and on standby.
113504	114805	Say hello to Alan.
114945	115685	It's me again.
115925	116745	How are you again?
116886	117306	I'm good.
117766	118566	And what's new with you?
118586	119707	This is the last time we talked to you.
119727	120867	Not much, working, working a lot.
122028	123889	I wanted to pinch hit last week, but I had to work.
125783	127564	My amazing boss got me the day off.
127764	128724	You gotta make the money.
129885	130405	There you go.
132225	138647	Actually, it looks like you're a horrible, terrible boss is in chat right now if you want to say a few words.
138708	139228	No, I'm kidding.
140348	143369	I'm giving him a hard time on purpose.
144389	144929	Let's see.
145190	146870	What else do I need to plug here at the top of the show?
146990	147310	Oh, yes.
147530	152672	Be sure you listen to us live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after...
153172	162339	The Bobby Blackwolf Show at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com Home to a variety of great geek shows, not just video game shows.
162400	168665	I think that's important to point out is that, you know, we do have some awesome video game shows, obviously, with this one and Bobby and Girls Gone Wow and Hard House.
169065	176751	We also have some non-video game shows, things like Under Station Live, Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Anime Jam Session, etc., etc.
176771	177392	Lots of good stuff.
177792	180594	So it all goes down at vognetwork.com
182755	206023	I was going to come with a kickoff topic tonight but I neglected to think of something because I'm a little bit my voice is shot tonight because and I think a lot of other shows in the network have been talking about this understation live and I just mentioned this on Bobby's show before and I think I've mentioned on here too I was asked I was fortunate enough to be asked to be the director of the return of the Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento and
206683	211126	and while it went marvelous on Friday, it was very exhausting.
211926	213047	I also emceed the show.
213547	218410	So I'm basically screaming obscenities into a mic in front of a crowd of 400 people and it felt really good.
218430	219911	It's not like what I do.
220852	222032	Kind of, kind of.
222132	224314	On this show every week, except I could see them.
225314	226415	I couldn't hide from them.
226535	227276	I could see them too.
230799	239286	I knew you were going to lose your voice or get damn close to it because when you were shouting your intro, there was a part where you literally blew your voice out.
239506	241848	We could hear that sound wasn't like...
242358	243539	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
261680	266103	So, we know that this is the season for video games to become movies.
266363	269886	Because, I don't know what it is, but every October, well I do know what it is.
269946	274749	It's the fact that October is kind of the month for Hollywood to release their crap films.
275309	277471	Which usually includes the video game movies.
277571	281233	Like, you know, all the Resident Evil movies come out late September, October.
281774	282874	We're getting Silent Hill.
283515	285076	And I'm not saying these movies are crap.
286810	292254	Hollywood kind of views them as crap because they're kind of in between this summer blockbuster and Oscar nominee.
292274	293775	Oscar season starts at Thanksgiving.
293995	294395	Exactly.
294455	297357	So most video game movies end up coming out in the October season.
297757	301480	I think if they were actually supposed to be crap, they'd be coming out in January.
301700	303941	I think it's just a good time.
304001	311687	I mean, the two movies that came out video game-wise this year are both kind of monster Halloween-y movies.
311747	313828	I mean, Resident Evil is more of an action movie, but
314076	318419	But there's the Transylvania Hotel or whatever and the Frankenweenie and all that stuff's coming out.
320761	322443	Wreck-It Ralph very soon, actually.
322843	324564	Although technically it's a November movie.
324604	328647	And I think they're just... Wreck-It Ralph, I mean... Here's the thing about Wreck-It Ralph.
328748	330969	I know we're all excited about Wreck-It Ralph, right?
331570	333571	Because it's Disney and it's video games.
333772	341998	So obviously there's a great cross-section here that this show represents very well that is very excited for Wreck-It Ralph.
342078	342799	But I think for...
343699	345620	I'm not sure how it's going to do in the mainstream.
345640	348302	I think it is still kind of a risky thing for Disney.
348882	353585	So I think that's why it's not their Thanksgiving movie or their Christmas movie.
353985	357387	But it's kind of that odd little place.
357607	361129	It's in a place where it will either flop horribly and disappear.
361169	362270	I don't think that'll actually happen.
362950	365011	I think it's going to do better than that.
391120	401264	The funny thing is, I think it's going to be a lot of parents who are actually into it because of all the Nintendo references and things they remember taking their kids.
401764	406706	I think it's truly a movie that's geared towards both and there's a lot of people that are excited about that.
407766	410067	Anyway, I got on a tangent talking about Wreck-It Ralph.
410467	419191	What I really wanted to ask about was since we're in this time of year where we talk about video game, movies, and so forth, I just finished doing a stage show
420572	424217	So what video game do you think deserves a stage show?
424517	427341	What video game deserves an adaptation?
427361	430525	It doesn't have to be a musical, but think Broadway style.
430946	436694	What video game do you think should become a full-fledged on or off Broadway production?
437385	444831	Um, I... Well, they've already kind of done this as a music... Like a video, but... Buggy Saints Row.
445891	448053	Because that video was hilarious.
448433	448674	Yeah.
448754	449934	Because it was done Broadway style.
450415	450615	Yeah.
450655	451376	And it was hilarious.
451556	453437	So, I'd go for that.
453497	461763	You know, have a bunch of people doing, like, you know, the artistic dancing and singing and stuff like that and have video of Saints Row being Buggy.
461823	464205	Or you can even, you know, do Buggy Driver 3.
464265	464565	Because...
466087	469870	Driver 3 is probably very, very, very, very buggy.
470811	471992	I want new music for that, though.
473754	476576	Alan, what would you want to see on Broadway?
476857	477617	Maniac Mansion.
477898	479059	Maniac Mansion?
479259	481301	That's probably almost too easy of an answer.
481541	483083	It was a TV show at one point, right?
483163	483323	Yeah.
484464	487447	Or my troll answer is Echo the Dolphin.
488868	489489	Okay.
490089	495953	That wouldn't be a Broadway production so much as it would be like the tank show at SeaWorld.
496954	497974	It'd be like ice capades.
498194	499555	You know, someone comes out in a dolphin suit.
501457	502317	They're swimming through rain.
502337	503098	Hey, hey, hey.
503498	505059	Are you saying that dolphins can't ice skate?
505099	506380	Because I want to see that.
508101	514445	Okay, they don't have to ice skate, but they can hop up and slide across the ice and then slip back into the water.
515043	515624	Mass Effect Halloween
525467	527168	Should Mass Effect be a musical?
527208	529089	You can't do those effects on a stage.
529249	529909	That needs a movie.
529949	532510	But if you could, it would be amazing.
532610	533591	It would not be amazing.
533771	539033	Let's look at some of the answers from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
539793	542895	Wicked says, Final Fantasy VI, the opera scene.
543495	547977	I think that's a very, you know... Well, I mean, technically it was an opera.
548077	552119	So it's like, now you're talking about the play that became the video game that became the play.
552139	552219	Yeah.
552739	556842	That's like Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game type of thing.
558583	561826	DarkSakura is in our chat tonight saying Clu Clu Land.
563247	563947	How would that work?
564027	565869	Somebody would just pole dance on stage.
566609	568571	Clu Clu Land would be a showgirls type thing.
568651	569411	Irritating stick.
571933	572814	Katamari Damacy.
572834	573194	Yeah.
574136	576318	Oh wow, that would be a hell of a stage show.
576458	577900	That's like Lion King right there.
578080	582724	That's like some crazy stuff.
583164	586587	Someone's going to come out of there and be like, did I just drop acid or something?
587188	588309	What happened to that?
588389	591912	Stan in our chatroom says, Space Channel 5 should be on Broadway.
592573	594574	Now there you go, there's a great musical idea.
595896	597357	That could actually work.
597757	613987	Which is kind of sad That could work Sad in an awesome way though Let's see SSJ100Matt says Parappa the Rappa Let's see Stan says in Chicago they've done a Mario burlesque show Same with Zelda I think
615436	617237	That's just cosplay strippers.
617298	618018	I mean, come on.
618639	619499	That's all that is.
620320	621341	Burlesque show.
621461	622201	Okay, fine.
622501	623963	Let's just add some class to that.
624103	626585	It's a fucking cosplay person stripping.
626605	630448	Hey, now, I have friends that do burlesque that would take a lot of offense to what you're saying right now.
630548	630788	Good.
631168	632169	I aim to offend everybody.
633530	634390	You are so rude.
635871	637311	Well, and here's the thing.
638811	640632	At least you can say this.
640832	644613	If the burlesque community has done it, you know what other communities probably done it?
645833	646633	Drag queens.
647093	651874	So my question is, has there been a Mario or Zelda drag queen show?
653115	655615	Alan, you used to live in the city and go to these shows.
656375	659316	What was the craziest drag queen show you saw in the city?
659996	663499	Um, they were all really amazing, actually.
663699	667622	One time I went and they did Ziggy Stardust album from start to finish.
668383	668643	Yeah.
668983	671145	Smashing Pumpkins, Drag Tribute Night.
671265	671886	It was amazing.
672386	672626	Yeah.
673247	676349	See, when I think of drag queens, I don't think of Smashing Pumpkins, so that's kind of interesting.
676369	677950	Well, that's why San Francisco's more alternative.
678871	679672	Oh, excuse me.
680232	682114	San Francisco's hipster drag, apparently.
682134	682434	Yeah.
684678	688000	The whole cabaret, you know, the greatest level of all, you're not going to find that there.
689340	694242	Ranma in the chat says, Loki, I know people that do cosplay burlesque, dude.
695903	698144	Burlesque stripping, fine.
698344	704527	Are we really just going to like... Are you telling me that the end of the... And it's happening in Ranma's room.
704547	710689	I'm sorry, are you telling me that the end of the show that they don't end up with less clothing on, therefore they are stripping off clothing?
710849	712390	It's the same thing.
713289	713769	Out of this world
743041	745663	DJ Morpheus in chat says, I saw a peach drag queen at New York Comic Con.
745683	748645	Actually, I gotta say, the peach drag queen thing has been done at several conventions.
748665	749266	I've seen that.
750507	750567	So...
767694	768134	DarkSakura.com
796969	799110	Mass Effect 3, the DLC that came out.
800151	801111	Been playing the hell out of that.
801252	804033	They added, you know, we talked about, or you guys talked about it a little bit last week.
804634	810437	The Collectors, which were the antagonists in 2, are now an enemy class that you can roll into in the multiplayer matches.
811297	816721	And I unlocked the Volus Adept, which is an ultra rare and 7 unlockable character.
817221	822924	And I'm sure saying Volus Adept is the same as saying, like, Pineapple Toaster Oven to most people in our listeners.
823084	824185	Pineapple Toaster Oven?
824245	824385	Yeah.
824665	825445	Awesome!
825906	827986	I like pineapple and I like toaster ovens.
828987	830207	Sounds amazing.
830247	833788	I unlocked one of the new coveted secret characters.
833928	835989	How about a toaster oven that cuts the pineapple for you?
836009	838030	So you don't have to.
841015	866845	I played some Black Mesa Source a little bit but not as much as I have been because I already went through and beat it and I'm waiting for them to patch in the end of the game Mass Effect Infiltrator because about three weeks ago I upgraded my phone I now have a Galaxy S3 I believe Bobby Blackwolf got one about a month ago so I downloaded the Infiltrator Mass Effect game for it
868226	875957	It looks gorgeous, but it controls so bad that it makes me angry that I spent the four bucks on it.
876718	881666	It controls so poorly for me that it makes me feel like... Have you ever had someone...
883426	893818	You show them a game like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto, and it's someone who does not play video games, and you hand them the controller, and you're like, okay, here's how you move, and here's how you get in a car, and they just drive off a cliff.
893978	897943	The first thing they do is they just die because they don't know how to play games.
899064	902228	Infiltrator controls so poorly that it makes me feel like I'm one of those people.
903430	912208	and I told James about it and he has it on iPad and he said he made himself beat it just because he has a boner for Mass Effect and he's like, oh yeah, the game's a total piece of shit.
912528	913791	I can't believe I beat it all the way through.
915089	916530	It sucks for some of these hardcore franchises.
935080	935981	Fruit Ninja, yes.
936541	938343	For whatever they're doing in that game, no.
940646	943349	That's really it, I think.
944049	945090	Oh, and Tiny Tower.
945110	950096	I don't know how to play Tiny Tower, which is like a two-year-old iPhone game, but
950410	955597	But since you're coming off having the phone that doesn't even have a QWERTY keyboard on it, too.
955777	958481	I had the BlackBerry equivalent of the Nokia brick.
958521	963328	You know, the classic, you know, you throw the Nokia brick at a car and the car explodes and the brick is fine.
963348	964910	I had the BlackBerry equivalent of that.
965290	966973	And now, so going from that to this...
967970	973974	Android, Ice Cream Sandwich, ooh, you know, little laptop in your pocket is quite a change.
974374	977576	In Tiny Tower, I give all of my stores perverted names.
978597	980378	The laundromat is called the Stank Panties.
983100	987002	I've got, the TV studio is named after a porn website, which I'm not going to say.
987143	990004	So it's actually, it's Porn Studio because of the name I gave it.
990505	991725	So yeah, it's good times.
992026	993987	Good times, killer game.
995967	1003195	Now, just to fan the flames of this, what made you decide to go with the Galaxy S3 on the day the iPhone 5 came out?
1004815	1033705	to be pragmatic about it you represent the Apple portion of this household which is fine I'm not hating on that but it's like if we want to be you know the ultimate geek duo we need Android representation up in here so that people can come to us and they will ask Rob the Apple questions they can ask me the Android questions if I want to be pragmatic about it make sure all of our braces are covered that is the best possible answer you could have given good job this is why I keep I will investigate whatever it is you don't like
1033985	1036667	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1037028	1040370	So when they ask you about the Apple stuff, like, why should I get an iPhone 5?
1040510	1041331	Because it's new!
1042492	1043633	You gotta get the new thing.
1045494	1051479	So this week I've actually been trying to catch up on a lot of stuff that I haven't been playing because I've been playing a lot of Minecraft or whatever.
1051939	1055602	So, let's see, this week I played some Vita stuff.
1055622	1056603	That was also another thing.
1056643	1058585	I wanted to play games on the Vita because...
1059585	1083400	I haven't been and it was sorely neglected so I tried out a couple demos I had first Gravity Rush which was pretty cool just not really something I mean it's a good game but it's not something I'm going to be playing because I just don't want to play a lot of different games right now I've already got plenty of my play right now but it's a it's a unique looking game it's fun
1084060	1084860	So I played that.
1084880	1086181	I played LittleBigPlanet Vita.
1086481	1088782	Well, that was something I was like, oh, I'm probably going to get this.
1088882	1091403	But then I played it, and it's LittleBigPlanet.
1091583	1095965	It's great, but it's got the Vita gimmicks that you kind of expect in there.
1096345	1098806	And I was just kind of like, eh, it's another LittleBigPlanet game.
1099426	1101987	Probably won't play this, so I'm not going to get it.
1102727	1103608	That's kind of a bummer.
1103948	1105208	Well, no, it's not that at all.
1105288	1105929	It's a good game.
1106009	1106429	It's just...
1107805	1109806	I have LittleBigPlanet 2 that I haven't played.
1109906	1113047	Why am I going to buy another LittleBigPlanet game that I probably won't play?
1114547	1122150	I need to finish other games first before... I'm just trying not to get into that mode of, like, I need to get all these games because they're good.
1122650	1130672	Then I'm going to be sitting on all these games that are good and not have time to play them and then more good stuff's going to come out and I'm not going to have time to play that.
1130692	1135334	I ended up... There's a ton of games I have that are really old that I haven't played yet.
1135454	1135654	Like...
1136614	1137895	and 3D.GameHeroes.
1138115	1141357	I've lent that out to so many people and I have yet to play that game.
1141797	1142438	It's a good game.
1142458	1143258	It is a good game.
1143418	1144539	I know it's a good game.
1144959	1148761	But that game came out around the same time as Red Dead Redemption or something.
1148841	1151223	And it was just like, ooh, Red Dead Redemption.
1151583	1153424	And I just kind of lost track of that.
1153908	1155509	We have a new story coming up later.
1155569	1160951	Maybe I'll mention it then, but there's this really good sale going on right now on a bundle of games.
1160991	1165172	And they're like all things that people tell me I should play and I've missed.
1165633	1172815	And it's like, wow, for a very, very, very small amount of money, I could catch up on three years worth of gaming.
1172875	1180678	And for that amount of money, I think it's a good deal, even if you don't play them, because that amount of money for one of those games... We're getting ahead of ourselves, though.
1180698	1180918	Sorry.
1181238	1181419	Sorry.
1183502	1190891	The game I actually did want to play, and I bought it mainly because it came out on this platform first, was Retro City Rampage.
1190931	1192953	I've been looking forward to this game forever now.
1193474	1198019	And they have the whole cross-buy thing on the PlayStation Network so you can get it for your PS3 and Vita.
1198360	1199381	So I bought it for my Vita.
1200402	1227418	and it's fantastic if I didn't have a cold at the point when I was playing it my body was aching and my eyes were just like burning if it wasn't for that I would probably have played a lot more of it but it's a fantastic game and there's just so many homages to everything it's just crammed full of just so much fan service and just like oh my god I remember that and even stuff that will probably fly over your head but
1228178	1229260	It's a fantastic game.
1229360	1240477	It's just basically the best description I read for it was someone says it's a developer's love letter to the industry for all the 8-bit games that he played.
1240537	1243421	It even has modern references and stuff in it.
1244182	1245323	The story is just throwaway.
1245383	1250085	It makes no sense whatsoever, but it's got everything, and it's seriously a great game.
1251705	1255787	So I am looking forward to playing that on my PlayStation 3, hopefully, but on the Vita, it's still pretty awesome.
1255847	1272655	Although, the game does tend to make the screen a lot smaller, like in different sections of the map and stuff like that, and so playing on a Vita, I'm sure it's not so bad on a TV, but on the Vita, the screen gets really small, so that might be something that might turn people off from it, but
1273255	1276357	It's a fun game, especially if you like, you know, Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.
1276617	1277578	It's very much like that.
1277638	1284142	But even if you don't like Grand Theft Auto, it's still a great, you know, action game with just all sorts of crazy stuff in it.
1284402	1288225	You know, from Bionic Commando to Bill and Ted to Back to the Future.
1289285	1290746	It's great.
1291207	1292507	And then, of course, more Minecraft.
1292667	1294168	Played a lot more Minecraft.
1294469	1295789	Fished up my castle, basically.
1299195	1301256	I don't know, come join the server if you haven't yet.
1303116	1309959	And then Call of Duty, we bought Map Pack 2, so we're going to start playing some new maps because we're just kind of getting bored of the ones we're playing.
1310999	1313780	Once again, tried doing another Streak Week, missed it by another game.
1315261	1315721	Good job.
1315841	1317001	Getting close, getting close.
1319602	1320743	And what else?
1322543	1323444	I think that was it, actually.
1323464	1324704	I think that was all the games I played.
1325177	1326558	So Alan, you'll get a kick out of this.
1326878	1329360	You know how, and the live listeners will understand this.
1329420	1332583	Podcast listeners, I apologize for a minute, but we're having these stream dropouts.
1333103	1334164	It looks like it's happened twice.
1334724	1341730	And yeah, we, just so you guys know, we actually purposely left the internet off for an hour today while we went to go run errands.
1341750	1344011	The cable modem and the router off for an hour.
1344031	1351197	Let's do a complete power cycle of every damn technological thing in this house so OLR can stay up with no downtime tonight.
1351757	1352458	Now we're on two.
1354179	1356541	It is not in this house.
1356942	1358103	The problem is not in this house.
1358143	1360605	The problem is on their end.
1361526	1365730	Hey, why do you guys keep dropping our stuff?
1365890	1371094	I wonder if it's not because sometimes I see that we're still sending data
1372095	1382897	and they start complaining in chat that it dropped and I'm like, it didn't drop because I see that we're still sending data because if Comcast goes down, then our net should stop working, I should get booted from IRC, all of that should happen.
1383177	1387698	So that makes me wonder, is it our stream provider that's really having the issue?
1387718	1388478	It doesn't happen to Bobby.
1389539	1390699	That's right, it doesn't happen to Bobby.
1390939	1391799	He's done it for an hour.
1391879	1394560	So what the hell's the problem?
1395180	1400301	Could be our, is he, where is, sorry, forgetting all, where's it located?
1400381	1401561	Where are we piping to right now?
1402325	1430022	Um, that's a good question that I don't know the answer to, that maybe Bobby does Cause if it's in the Midwest or the South, it could be our connection to there, and he's in Atlanta It very well could be, let me see if this tells me where we beam the show to, because I'm actually not sure Such great radio right now I know, but you know what, deal with it Um, it says New Jersey, so it would be infinitely closer Oh yeah, so for us, if we're piping to New Jersey then, there's, yeah, it's probably the stream Weird To us
1430362	1432943	And I mean, it is New Jersey, so no wonder the stream's getting late.
1432963	1433803	Oh, stop it.
1435184	1437124	Who else do you want to offend tonight while we're at it?
1437144	1437544	I don't know.
1437624	1438345	We're still early.
1438445	1439445	We haven't even started story yet.
1439465	1440905	You've done burlesque people.
1441846	1442846	You've done New Jersey.
1442866	1444607	I'm not saying there's anything wrong with burlesque.
1444627	1450109	Burlesque is awesome because it's, once again, women stripping off their clothes, which is, you know, that's fine.
1450389	1456571	I think really the only difference between burlesque and strippers is strippers kind of go all the way, whereas burlesque is more of the tease and stuff.
1456631	1456891	Yeah.
1457911	1459593	But they're still stripping off their clothes.
1459613	1468284	They're just like, you know, Skinemex strippers versus, you know, the stripper strippers, I guess.
1468978	1469959	Oh boy, all right.
1470319	1472720	Who spilled Jaeger and spray tan on the server rack?
1473621	1476462	Moving on to my gaming week.
1476922	1478923	I had a very DarkSakura week.
1479124	1481045	My gaming week was very DarkSakura.
1481085	1482165	Does everybody know what that means?
1482185	1483126	Aspect and WoW.
1483146	1483666	That's right.
1483946	1484346	Sims?
1484907	1488969	No, that's DarkSakura circa 2009 gaming week.
1489469	1491870	My gaming week this week was I played a lot of WoW.
1493431	1495732	I did some dailies.
1496232	1501294	I shouldn't say a lot of WoW because I didn't play a lot of WoW because I've had weeks where I've played a lot of WoW.
1501694	1502895	But this is not one of those weeks.
1503055	1505936	But I played enough WoW to do a few dailies here and there and so forth.
1506436	1507577	And then I played Mass Effect 3.
1508877	1516419	because, as Alan mentioned, the new DLC went up, the multiplayer DLC, and it's very well-rounded.
1516980	1523902	It's got a whole new class of aliens that you can fight, the collectors from Part 2, so that breathes new life into it.
1524522	1525902	It has some new classes.
1525982	1530264	It doesn't matter because I won't be seeing them anyway because I never get that stuff in my...
1531164	1535205	Premium Spectre packs, but I did finally get one of the ones I really wanted.
1535586	1541888	I got the Cerberus Adept, and I've been playing that class a lot because he's the guy with the whips, and you're just like, Hulk smash!
1542248	1542968	Hulk smash!
1543388	1544549	Everything, and it's great.
1544709	1545709	Vanguard's like that, too.
1545849	1546710	Yeah, it's awesome.
1547070	1552271	Like, we were doing a multiplayer match earlier with some friends, and one of my friends was like, who sent the body flying out the window?
1552291	1552832	I'm like, me.
1554012	1557455	So, yeah, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is still really fun.
1558175	1561538	And I like that they've staggered this content a bit.
1561698	1562739	So, like, what is it?
1562859	1566342	Every Tuesday, we're going to get just a handful of new things, right?
1566462	1567903	Every Tuesday for a little while.
1568243	1568843	That's awesome.
1568924	1573147	I don't know if they're doing it because there are 16 new kits where a kit is a...
1574188	1574348	Yeah.
1574428	1574648	Yeah.
1574828	1574948	Yeah.
1589941	1591883	Oh, maybe that's what they do.
1591903	1591983	Oh.
1617165	1619307	Street Fighter IV Street Fighter IV, yeah.
1633041	1636123	You've probably got all the other achievements by now.
1636163	1637804	I mean, there's not a lot else to work towards.
1638485	1642047	Alan, heck, you haven't even been playing since launch, but your N7 score is what?
1642607	1643188	800 and something now?
1643268	1644048	It's like 820 now.
1644268	1649612	It would be higher, but when I do golds and silvers, I'm usually on a level 20 and they don't gain XP.
1650192	1651193	Oh, okay.
1651353	1651613	I see.
1652074	1652354	Gotcha.
1653174	1653575	Alright.
1653595	1655436	Alright, well that was my gaming week.
1655456	1656958	So let's move into some housekeeping.
1657058	1659520	We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1659940	1662902	We are on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1663383	1669168	I believe today or tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow, is the last day to nominate us for the podcast awards.
1669548	1676333	So please, for your consideration, Best Gaming Podcast and the Stitcher Awards also going on right now.
1676353	1679696	And I think they end either tomorrow or Friday.
1679816	1680417	So please...
1681137	1684940	Consider a nomination for us there as well for Best Gaming Podcast.
1685281	1687622	If for whatever reason you don't want to vote for us, that's cool.
1687882	1693327	Please support one of the other shows on the VOG Network or at least, bare minimum, support Indie Podcast.
1693647	1696969	And then Stitcher, I believe it's every day or every day you can vote.
1697290	1698671	You can nominate for Stitcher every day.
1698851	1699171	You can.
1699611	1701893	So Podcast Award is just one nomination.
1701953	1708538	So we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed and let you know what happens either next week or in a couple weeks when those nominations are announced.
1708578	1708858	Remember,
1710119	1715181	Usually, I hate the whole begging for votes thing, but it really is good exposure.
1715501	1722122	And these guys, as much as some of these big podcasts are fine, the NPR podcasts are great.
1722443	1724263	Like, wait, wait, don't tell me it's a great show.
1724603	1728964	The Adam Carolla show is a fine show if you like him and all that.
1729424	1733005	But they don't need the additional exposure.
1733045	1735186	They have plenty of corporate exposure and stuff.
1735206	1738387	So we really want to see the indies succeed in these shows.
1738587	1740708	Because there's a lot of really good indie programs too.
1741168	1742728	Just like there's good indie games.
1743829	1746930	Anyhow, let's move on to the news.
1747010	1748330	Oh wait, no, one other thing I gotta plug.
1748570	1749070	Very important.
1750411	1754092	I always like to plug the shows that are kind enough to invite me on as a guest.
1754592	1755932	And I was a guest this week.
1755972	1758293	I don't know how I fit this in this week, but I did.
1758833	1762514	I was a guest on Nerdgasm Network, their gaming show.
1762634	1763475	It's episode 54 of...
1765095	1765635	NerdgasmNetwork.com
1790210	1793491	You'll hear more about putting it all out on the table, and I'll just leave it at that.
1793991	1795912	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1795932	1797132	Some more burlesque talk, I guess.
1797293	1797913	Yeah, yes.
1798353	1800974	Actually, very similar to burlesque, but in a different way.
1801914	1804455	Let's move on to gaming news, Loki.
1805020	1808101	So it's another year, so another Microsoft game has been leaked.
1808241	1808781	Hurrah!
1810121	1818523	Apparently, Microsoft is investigating a report of Halo 4 being leaked, and they're working with law enforcement to address the issue.
1819803	1828506	There's images being surfaced on social networking sites depicting retail discs and a dashboard featuring the game ready to play, blah blah blah.
1828686	1829346	It's already leaked.
1829486	1832887	Yes, it's absolutely 100% been leaked.
1833207	1833727	It's out there.
1836221	1840428	And of course, you know, they're like, well, we're clarified with that's actually it's been leaked 100%.
1841790	1842631	It's been leaked.
1842751	1844173	Okay.
1846116	1846977	Has it been leaked?
1847779	1848500	It's been leaked.
1849614	1869148	I don't know that much more you can say other than it's pretty good and also I guess some other information apparently the game is going to be on two discs the second disc is going to contain installation data for the multiplayer stuff and once you've installed that then you can actually play the game with the first disc kind of like Forza 4
1870023	1871644	Now, Loki, help me understand something.
1872084	1874926	How are people able to play this game before the release date?
1877407	1877748	Piracy.
1878388	1878508	Oh.
1879609	1879889	Okay.
1882911	1883951	But piracy's bad.
1884071	1885852	It is bad, and they will get banned if they go online.
1886453	1887253	That's it.
1887553	1889274	And Microsoft called the po-po.
1890255	1893597	Yeah, they're really investigating.
1893617	1896799	I was going to say, look, obviously...
1897458	1902402	They're gonna say, you know, they're gonna invoke the police because, and you know, it is a crime.
1903183	1906926	You can poo-poo it all you want, but stealing shit is a crime, right?
1907547	1912331	So, but what will the police really do to investigate, you think?
1912371	1919337	Do you think the police is coming after little Johnny Pirate that went on the Pirate Bay and downloaded the program?
1919698	1924402	Or do you think the police are looking more into how the leak happened?
1924682	1926603	I think they're trying to find out how it got leaked.
1927223	1929384	Well, then the police aren't doing a very good job.
1929704	1936646	I hate to say it, but let's see, Gears of War 3 leaked, Halo 3 leaked, like every big Microsoft title leaks.
1937687	1941168	Did Fable the Journey leak or did that just slip off the radar?
1941542	1946767	No, any title out there, any title that's being released is leaked usually a week before it comes out.
1946787	1951551	And the reason that happens is because that's how the shipment schedule is for retailers.
1951611	1965503	They usually get stuff Monday prior, or if it's direct retail partners like, say, GameStop and BestFies and stuff like that, they're getting their product probably the week before on a Wednesday or something like that.
1966755	1968136	Now here's how I think this happened.
1968416	1969957	And this is totally speculative.
1970978	1972259	This is not the week before.
1972619	1975441	Halo is not supposed to be out for like three weeks.
1975902	1976562	Yeah, exactly.
1976822	1977663	Here's how I think it happened.
1977683	1978784	Well, a couple of ways.
1979024	1983207	One, someone nabbed a copy when they were pressing it.
1983387	1985449	You know, an actual copy out of the duplicator.
1986671	2001501	or, and this happens occasionally, the warehouse that ships the product, the Microsoft product, will misship something and accidentally send something early, like way earlier than they're supposed to receive it in.
2002041	2016131	For example, personally, we had some Skylanders stuff for the new Skylanders Giants that they accidentally shipped us earlier than it should have been, like about a week earlier, which is usually unusual.
2016832	2017793	Well, lucky you.
2018233	2020516	Some lucky asshole got Halo 4.
2020836	2021897	You got Skylanders.
2021937	2022758	No, no, no.
2023099	2026082	We're not doing anything with Skylanders, but I'm just saying it happens.
2026503	2030067	There's been Microsoft-released games in the last few weeks.
2030167	2033111	We had Fable, and then next week we've got...
2035333	2036514	Dance Central 3, Forza, Horizon
2052405	2073088	or who knows it could have just been somewhere else an employee you never know I mean because it's one of the biggest games this and probably Call of Duty Black Ops 2 are gonna be like the ones the scene groups out there fight each other who's gonna be able to release it first and you know it's it's all bragging all EPing bragging rights basically like oh I'm playing Halo and you're not or so that's that's it
2073712	2076157	So here's the question I have to ask.
2077218	2079542	How can Microsoft stop this?
2079983	2082508	How can Microsoft stop that leak from happening?
2083578	2085438	They can't.
2085518	2091680	They have to be more secure about how they duplicate their game, just the whole handling process of it.
2092260	2101462	The way other publishers do it, at least they try to prevent street date violators, is by delivering a product as late as possible to those retail chains.
2101622	2105142	We're talking like getting it a day early instead of a week early, that type of thing.
2106483	2111564	Obviously, something like this, as far as we're aware, this hasn't even hit the retail chains yet.
2111604	2112244	This is just...
2113584	2114325	Thanks for watching!
2128994	2129654	and so on.
2157401	2161385	So yeah, it's not good, but I don't think it's really going to hurt them in the end.
2161425	2163927	I mean, they're still going to sell a buttload of those.
2166505	2172988	Yeah, I mean, the reality is you kind of have to ask yourself if you're going to download one of these games and so forth.
2173628	2189135	Am I the type of person that sits there and goes, aw, every time I hear one of these stories about game developers closing or why did Big Bad EA close such and such developer or so forth, yet I'm not allowing said company to make money?
2191840	2193702	You kind of can't have both, right?
2194062	2196024	People have to get paid.
2196044	2197044	Yeah, I don't think that's fair, though.
2197064	2201228	I think what you're basically saying, though, those are a lot of these secondary companies and stuff.
2201588	2204991	Some of it has nothing to do with how well the game sold.
2205011	2208694	They need to cut profits because it didn't sell as many copies as they thought it would.
2208754	2212037	Not necessarily because piracy ate up hundreds of thousands of copies.
2213739	2217962	Once again, that's assuming that every person that pirates something would have bought the game regularly.
2218903	2219363	DarkSakura.com
2238817	2251242	as much as I don't want to agree with you I think I actually kind of do I think a vast number of people who pirate games were never going to buy that game in the first place I'm going to tell you this much they only download it because they can
2251798	2252198	Exactly.
2252318	2254840	And, you know, I did it with Grand Theft Auto 4.
2255100	2256141	Grand Theft Auto 4 came out.
2256421	2258602	It leaked down the internet one week before it came out.
2259382	2262204	I still bought the game, but I wanted to play it right now.
2262484	2265246	I wanted to play it as early as possible, and so I did.
2265566	2268287	I played it a week early, but who cares?
2268548	2270048	I think I've more than paid for it.
2270088	2270829	I bought, what...
2271549	2285947	6 copies of the game when it came out and 6 copies of episodes from Liberty City when it came out and 6 copies of the first DLC before the episodes from Liberty City stuff came out I think they got my money so I don't feel so bad about playing the game a week early
2286613	2290216	I think this is why the industry is very eager to get on digital distribution.
2290497	2301387	I think this is why you see some companies maybe rushing digital distribution and really trying to push it more and more is because if you think about it, digital distribution is a great way to curb piracy.
2301807	2311876	It won't stop it, but it would stop these leaks from happening because essentially you've cut out the entire process of printing the discs and the going gold and shipping and the problems there.
2311896	2312617	You're cutting that all.
2312637	2313057	all out.
2313077	2315800	You know what leaks out even earlier than games like this?
2316561	2317662	Xbox Live Arcade games.
2318523	2318844	Wow.
2319064	2320085	They leak out even earlier.
2320345	2320666	Know why?
2320966	2321026	Why?
2321046	2322548	Because people have access to PartnerNet still.
2323329	2326772	And people download them off PartnerNet and they put them out there.
2326792	2328174	They just crack it and put it out and
2328314	2328454	HALO 4
2346329	2347250	Yeah, it's going to get pirated.
2347290	2350571	I mean, all the games get pirated, but I don't think that they're going to sell.
2350691	2353913	It's not going to be like, oh, crap, it didn't sell at all.
2354413	2355274	That's not going to happen.
2355654	2361617	No one's going to shut down 343 Studios because it didn't sell because of, oh, piracy, it just ruined the whole game.
2361657	2362837	No, it's not like that.
2363378	2368420	There's not that many people, compared to the millions of people who buy it, that pirate games.
2368460	2375864	It's such a small section, but they would want you to think it is because they've got to blame their loss of sales on something.
2376570	2383838	Do you think though that if this hadn't happened maybe they would have sold a quarter million more copies?
2384159	2384339	No.
2386201	2391968	Because if this hadn't happened it's going to leak out again when it comes out and those same people will have pirated it.
2392498	2397482	Ramma in our chatroom says Halo 4 could come out at $19.99 and yet it will be pirated.
2397962	2405268	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com follows that up with iPhone piracy is rampant and that's 99 cent apps.
2406428	2410692	I think that's a perfect example where it's like people do it because they can.
2411412	2417515	I mean, if you're giving someone the option to get something for free versus paying for it, why wouldn't you get it for free?
2417655	2424299	I mean, I understand that there's this whole morality of, oh, well, if I don't pay... I mean, they try to push this shit on you even at the movie theater.
2424379	2424699	And legality.
2425019	2426140	You are taking a risk.
2426260	2428001	I understand that, but it's just... Okay.
2429041	2430602	It's... It would be like...
2432703	2433203	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2455710	2459513	It just has a hole over everything that you can't catch everybody.
2460393	2465016	The best defense is to stop the people that upload them in the first place, and then there's nothing for them to pirate.
2465736	2466296	You know what, though?
2466397	2473961	I think I could look you in the eye with a straight face and totally mean it and say, you would never catch me down there being one of those looters.
2474121	2475022	I just think it's wrong.
2475622	2478664	And I would never participate in a looting event like that.
2478764	2480705	And I really believe that about my character.
2480945	2487666	I'm not trying to say I'm better than anybody else or whatever, but I know they had a situation like that happen in Britain not that long ago.
2487826	2492747	There were these huge riots and all these things, and there were these looting, and a bunch of kids got caught and went to jail and all this stuff.
2492787	2496128	And I remember looking at it going, what a bunch of fucking thugs.
2497088	2498268	I wouldn't be one of those thugs.
2498668	2500048	That's just ridiculous, that stuff.
2500448	2504729	Mainly my analogy was that how do you go after everybody?
2505409	2509630	As a literal metaphor, I don't really think that's the best comparison.
2509850	2515799	Of course, once again, the video game industry or the movie industry would like you to think that that's exactly the same thing.
2526885	2545927	the great debate that will never end but maybe this is why we see more free to play games happening because it's like fuck it we'll make our money other ways no seriously that's a great idea as long as you can secure DLC but that's a great idea because then it's like fuck pirate it as much as you want get as many copies out there because that's more people that can buy the DLC for it
2546247	2571210	and that's why I think it is more popular approach because it gets the game into more people's hands and more people want to try it because it's free there if it sucks whatever I just delete it you know and that that's why I think it is a good way to go but then again at the same time some of these companies are getting greedy and they're taking the free-to-play model for their paid games and that's just pissing people off even more and they're like fuck you I'm just gonna I'm not only am I gonna pirate this game but I'm also gonna pirate all your DLC
2573576	2574917	All right, well, moving on.
2575578	2580182	This piracy debate will never be settled, so I'm going to go ahead in the interest of time and move on with the news.
2580642	2586607	But what a great segue talking about a game that a lot of people probably just should have pirated.
2586647	2587188	Let's be real.
2587228	2588149	It wasn't very good.
2588469	2588889	No, I'm kidding.
2589189	2589610	I'm kidding.
2589650	2590010	I'm trolling.
2590030	2590350	I'm trolling.
2590831	2593653	But pirated DLC and all that definitely goes with this, too.
2593773	2595835	It's Street Fighter X Tekken.
2596436	2596756	I'm sorry.
2596796	2598317	You can't pirate something that's already on the disc.
2598337	2599238	Yeah.
2599318	2602419	Thank you for watching!
2617206	2620227	Like the Trash Bags, hefty update later this year.
2620627	2628090	It is supposed to rebalance the game, provide visual and mechanical tweaks, which I find interesting that they're going to actually tweak some of the visuals.
2629071	2638114	Every character in Street Fighter X Tekken is supposed to get some type of balancing tweaks and so forth, including Ken, Kazuya, Kami, Julia, and so on and so on.
2638194	2638614	Lots, lots.
2640735	2656575	also don't forget Street Fighter X Tekken is coming to the Vita I don't know if that means these same balancing things are already in that finished version or if there's a day one patch or whatever but that is due on October 23rd as a reminder that's just around the corner Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita didn't that game flop?
2657938	2670772	I think flop is a strong word but I think it didn't perform as well as they'd probably hoped word of mouth from friends who are usually like Capcom for life and just the reviews were like this is not very good
2672983	2694750	what I'm really curious about is where's the other half of this because we were supposed to be seeing Tekken cross Street Fighter and I'm wondering if Namco just started working on it this year they were working on Tekken Tag 2 maybe they've been developing them side by side they have the engine their joint project for this was announced 2 or 3 years ago right?
2700612	2701012	Let's move on.
2731690	2741882	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase CROWN Do you live in the Seattle area?
2742523	2743404	If so... No!
2746187	2762895	If you do, you might want to head over to Valve Software's website and take a little playtester survey and see if maybe you could become a hardware tester for their Valve appliance which clearly exists in some form though they haven't given it a name and we don't know what exactly it does.
2762915	2763595	I hope it's a fridge.
2763895	2765296	I hope it's a pineapple toaster oven.
2767245	2771909	So yeah, if you are in the Seattle and Bellevue area, is it?
2771989	2772449	Is that right?
2774071	2778054	They're looking for hardware testers, and it's a questionnaire.
2778094	2779195	How long have you been gaming?
2780016	2780997	Are you a completionist?
2781077	2782638	Are you an achievement hunter?
2783639	2785600	How often do you unlock 100% of everything?
2786301	2790885	How often do you beat completely every game that you play from start to finish?
2791565	2792706	You wouldn't be qualified for this, Rob.
2792726	2793367	No.
2794127	2794608	Shut up.
2795308	2799672	Well, you can expect people that go into this to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
2799772	2800733	Oh, up through the teeth.
2800953	2803034	And you can expect that those will be broken.
2805356	2805616	Wait.
2805897	2815444	So from however many months ago that they were looking for hardware engineers, they have an alpha clearly that they want people under lock and key to go check out.
2815884	2816425	Very interesting.
2816445	2818046	Whatever their Steam box is.
2818807	2820288	I look forward to what leaks out of this.
2820448	2820588	Yeah.
2822611	2823472	Moving on, Loki.
2824252	2825613	Alright.
2826054	2830817	So, of course, remember that there was the announcement that Sony has bought Gaikai.
2831317	2837342	And so now Gaikai's website, they've been updated to kind of resemble a little bit more of the PlayStation lineup.
2837822	2844467	You see images of Loving Planet as well as Uncharted and it looks like Killzone in there as well.
2845047	2849511	They have some stills from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance and...
2852192	2862856	They didn't really say any additional details or something, but obviously it seems like this is something that's going to be offered as part of the PlayStation platform soon.
2864476	2871459	So you can probably expect some game streaming either by the end of this year or maybe an announcement at E3, if nothing else.
2873580	2880105	Unfortunately, around the same time though, Gaikai, they've kind of found themselves as part of a patent lawsuit.
2881185	2886769	A Delaware company called T5 Labs, they filed a suit against them.
2887249	2899578	I guess their patent for providing a system and methods of sharing a graphics processing unit between plurality of programs.
2903925	2905426	That's the patent.
2905466	2914172	Now, I'm not sure if this is just a patent troll company or if this is actually a company that does this stuff, but I'd be willing to bet it's probably a patent troll company.
2915113	2920297	So, they have no comment on it, but there is a lawsuit in place.
2920877	2923019	Is this what really put OnLive out of business?
2924039	2931324	Because I would have thought if anybody was going to complain, it would have been one of the other companies that deals in this same technology.
2932845	2935987	I'd be willing to bet that T5 Labs probably hasn't put anything out.
2936007	2937668	You probably can't even find them on the internet.
2938849	2940650	I'm going to even check that out right now.
2940710	2941050	Let's see.
2941111	2942231	T5 Labs.
2942932	2943412	Let's see.
2943812	2945654	Are they even a part of the internet?
2946514	2947075	Oh, here we go.
2947155	2949056	T5Labs.com.
2949997	2956942	And yeah, it looks like they've got some crappy flash animation on here.
2958703	2962106	But it's implied that it has to do with games because...
2964155	2964656	Star Wars Scrolls
2980472	2984013	T5 Labs enables people to play PC games on their existing set-top box.
2984213	2988614	The service operates on a video-on-demand client-type system.
2988694	2994735	It says T5 Labs' patent-pending technology allows the system to work on ultra-low latency.
2994815	2996296	We call it Instinct Gaming.
2999216	3001077	Well, that does sound like Dakai.
3001297	3004938	Well, it does seem like then that they are actually making something.
3004958	3006438	It's not a patent-troll company, so...
3008248	3009709	I guess I am corrected.
3010630	3011071	Alright.
3011211	3015294	But that is refreshing to see that they're not just a patent troll.
3016215	3017256	Alright, well moving on.
3018462	3019443	Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC Carrie-Anne Moss
3045683	3048666	She was also the mom in that Shia LaBeouf movie, and I saw that.
3049326	3052068	Oh, and I think she's in the new Silent Hill movie as well, actually.
3052088	3052509	Oh, okay.
3052609	3056132	Yeah, I think she's one of the crazy... I think she plays the villainess, I think.
3057233	3057433	Yeah.
3057473	3057953	So, hmm.
3058414	3060035	Where was the Borg queen last time?
3060075	3061116	This time it's Carrie Ann Moss.
3061416	3061877	There you go.
3062377	3072866	Well, anyhow, I suggest you do not fuck with Arya in the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC, which they are saying will be double the size of Leviathan.
3073430	3077351	Leviathan wasn't that big of a DLC campaign though.
3077531	3078291	It really wasn't.
3078671	3083712	Now, Lair of the Shadow Broker is still the one that they need to beat as far as quality and length.
3083952	3089053	Because Lair of the Shadow Broker in Mass Effect 2 was a badass campaign from start to finish.
3089393	3090974	Yeah, Lair of the Shadow Broker was great.
3091374	3096255	And especially if Omega is going to be kind of like a hub like the Shadow Broker Lair was that you got in 2.
3096815	3097595	That would be great.
3098175	3120815	Omega was probably one of the best design places in the entire trilogy because if you're a science fiction geek like I am a lot of the design was based off of I'm blanking Harrison Ford in the 80s Blade Runner a lot of Omega is based a lot of off the scenes in Blade Runner and the music was amazing and I'm really glad that we're revisiting this place in three
3122212	3127238	Also, the big news about this DLC, female Turians for the first time you're going to see.
3127478	3130442	Yeah, fans are wary.
3130462	3137030	There's always the comic books and so forth where they've shown up, but the first time in the game is certainly a big deal.
3137950	3143474	Yeah, the fans, of course, want to see, you know... When you say the fans, you mean who?
3143594	3145295	Tumblr, Bioware forums?
3145976	3147197	All of that, the fandom.
3147977	3154322	Because a lot of people want to see female Turians because the entire trilogy... It's like, how do Turians have sex?
3154342	3155703	Because clearly they're all men everywhere.
3158325	3163709	People are worried that they're just going to, like, put a Turian head on, like, Tits Armor and be like, there it is, like...
3164389	3165530	They're fucking reptiles.
3165570	3166510	They shouldn't have tits.
3166570	3167350	Thanks, BioWare.
3167430	3169331	So I'm interested to see what they do.
3169611	3174513	And when you're talking about all of it, you've researched the fandom through extensive online research, right?
3174573	3175934	Yes, yes, yes.
3176014	3177615	I track Mass Effect tags on Tumblr.
3177755	3180176	And what sorts of things do you participate with in the fandom?
3180356	3181836	I just reblog stuff and favorite stuff.
3181856	3183137	Yeah, have you ever written a fanfic?
3183297	3183477	No.
3184258	3184718	No, I don't.
3185258	3186518	Have you ever read a fanfic?
3187999	3189900	I've read some hot Emshanko stuff.
3191786	3193789	What was your favorite, M. Shinko?
3195170	3209068	I think it was Kaden was jogging through the Citadel in booty shorts, and everyone was like, you know, Cat calling him in Shepard was all flustered and offended.
3210954	3212094	Kane's like, I don't know.
3212435	3213875	I can't believe you actually had an answer for that.
3213895	3214295	That's great.
3214675	3214915	All right.
3214975	3218737	Anyhow, just trolling you live on air.
3219197	3228360	Anyhow, also apparently about this new DLC, one of Mass Effect 2's characters, Zaid Massani, is supposed to return in this.
3228660	3230201	I don't remember him being in 3.
3231221	3233402	No, he was in 1 Quest, wasn't he?
3233462	3235703	Yeah, he's in the Quest with the little Volus from 1.
3236303	3237103	That's right.
3237343	3238464	And he's in the refugee camp.
3238504	3239524	You can talk to him.
3239704	3240765	Zaid sucked anyway.
3240985	3241305	Sorry.
3241425	3242165	That's my opinion.
3242185	3246707	$15 for the DLC, which is on the pricier end.
3246727	3248067	Absolutely.
3248567	3250428	Is that more than Shadowbroker was?
3250588	3252469	Was Shadowbroker $10 or was Shadowbroker also $15?
3253672	3254973	I think it might be 8 or 9 now.
3255073	3256834	I don't know how much it was back in 2011.
3282973	3284634	I've never had a bad experience
3303363	3303943	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3328058	3332859	Yeah, I was going to say, even though Cerberus took Omega, I'm sure there's a way to work it.
3332939	3335900	And Cerberus... I'm getting so nerdy into the ending of 2.
3337261	3340962	Cerberus took the remnants of the Collector base at the end of 2.
3341182	3342642	Even if you blow it up, they still have it.
3343062	3347263	So they could be controlling the Collectors now, or the Collectors show up and ambush both of you and Cerberus.
3347664	3348404	You know, either way.
3349524	3352867	Shayna Linko in chat says, they say that it's Cerberus, Rob, for Omega.
3352927	3354968	So that means nothing but Cerberus is going to show up?
3355809	3358131	Yeah, but that could be the plot twist, that the Collectors are there, too.
3359231	3362033	But yeah, all through 3, Arya talks about how it's Cerberus.
3362073	3363675	The Elusive Man kicked her out, and she's pissed.
3365296	3376504	And then, of course, maybe some of these other weapons that have been showing up and so forth, and even maybe the maps, because multiplayer maps get used in single-player sometimes.
3377338	3383340	Yeah, a lot of the multiplayer maps are unique to multiplayer though, now.
3383360	3383941	Not originally.
3385101	3394185	But you definitely see some multiplayer map, or you see some single, like in the Leviathan DLC, I could have sworn one of those maps looked a lot like one of the multiplayer maps, but it was just kind of like different.
3394265	3397446	It was a different layout, but kind of like the same assets.
3398266	3398546	Anyhow.
3398966	3400867	Alright, enough Mass Effect talk.
3401187	3402168	Loki's getting bored.
3403568	3406530	I'm sorry, I just totally tuned out that whole last segment.
3406650	3408231	Alright, hater, let's move on.
3408271	3410412	Maybe you'll be more interested in what Alan has to say.
3411893	3413013	Remember Darkstalkers?
3414114	3418256	2D fighting game, really creative characters, really underrated franchise.
3418356	3420257	Well, Capcom is bringing it back.
3421098	3427041	Darkstalkers Resurrection was announced at New York Comic Con this past week, and it is a HD cleanup.
3428761	3450228	Darkstalkers 2 and 3 and it's bundled together in one pack similar to Marvel vs. Capcom Origins and also if you remember the Final Fight Magic Sword combo where you can have it look like an arcade cabinet or you can have it be full screen it's going to be a package like one of those and it's going to be I think 1200 Microsoft points or $14.99
3452426	3455007	so yay Darkstalkers were you a fan of Darkstalkers?
3455267	3474312	I had a modded Saturn, Sega Saturn and I imported Darkstalkers 3 because it used the 4 meg ram cart for the people that played X-Men vs Street Fighter on the Saturn if you remember that it supported the 4 meg ram cart, it was arcade perfect, it was gorgeous do you think you'll be picking this up?
3476232	3478913	I'm gonna say no just because how often do I turn on the 360?
3481034	3481455	Seriously.
3481515	3481935	Fair enough.
3481955	3485658	Well, if they ever shut down the Mass Effect 3 servers, maybe you'll have a reason to.
3485918	3486859	Yeah, it's possible.
3489681	3491723	Mass Effect 4, Xbox exclusive.
3491743	3492343	What are you going to do?
3492763	3493364	What are you going to do?
3494145	3494665	I'm just kidding.
3495065	3495566	I'm trolling them.
3495626	3499028	I thought... Didn't they announce a new Darkstalkers game?
3499088	3500389	Or was this all the announcement was?
3500990	3504593	I think they were teasing that something was going to happen.
3504653	3506474	And I think this is that something.
3506574	3509797	But obviously, I think it's trying to either get people...
3510077	3511638	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3531849	3550419	A lot of people don't realize, well, the real people who've been with Capcom since the beginning will know this, but the combo system used in X-Men vs. Street Fighter and the combo system used in Marvel vs. Capcom, you know, the light, light, medium, medium, hard, hard, where you do the zigzag across all six buttons, that chain combo system, that was done in Darkstalkers.
3550519	3553861	That's the engine that they did that combo system in.
3555602	3556843	Wasn't that also Killer Instinct?
3556883	3557803	You could kind of do that, too?
3558404	3559184	Zigzag combos?
3559384	3560565	Those were weird Link combos.
3561243	3562903	Those were very specific things you had to do.
3562943	3565764	Because when you say zigzag combos with the six button, that's honestly what I think of.
3565824	3569405	I think of Killer Instinct before I think of that, but I get you.
3570725	3577926	All right, well, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some games coming out near you a little sooner than Darkstalkers, perhaps.
3578366	3579426	Let's start with the US, Loki.
3579966	3581847	All right, so let's see here.
3581927	3586028	This week, we have quite a few things coming out.
3586108	3587188	Starting off with...
3588769	3613831	Rocksmith Guitar and Bass technically it's like the first game with the bass expansion but they've got that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC as well as bundled with an electric guitar Dance Central 3 coming out this week on Xbox 360 Mugen Souls on PlayStation 3 also let's see here
3615287	3625355	We've got 007 Legends on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3626435	3631179	Doom 3 BFG Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3631919	3635282	Zumba Fitness Core on the Wii and Xbox 360.
3636943	3645685	Jeopardy on PS3 and 360, Wheel of Fortune also on PS3 and 360, Silent Hill Book of Memories for the Vita.
3645865	3647346	Man, that's been delayed forever.
3648366	3649366	That's finally coming out.
3651727	3653007	That was delayed quite a bit.
3653167	3655888	Yeah, because I don't think it was very good from what I hear.
3657288	3658288	Maybe they made it better.
3658748	3659949	I certainly hope so.
3660029	3661769	Otherwise, it's going to be kind of a disappointment.
3663435	3665677	Not that I'm not used to them being a disappointment.
3668080	3668880	Let's see what else.
3669601	3678729	I do know that one week from today, because they have to launch it on a Sunday because it's so special, Skylighter Giants coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and...
3682773	3683353	I think that's it.
3684134	3687236	Also, they're going to have a portal owners pack in case you bought the first game.
3688276	3690898	So, that would be it.
3691878	3693879	Alright, let's travel to Japan and look out there.
3693919	3695800	Actually, wait, I want to read a comment from chat real quick.
3695880	3701804	TigerClaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, when are they going to do a Rocksmith for keyboards?
3702364	3703445	Like, keyboard smith.
3704225	3730907	if they do that I am so there like I'm not that interested in learning how to play guitar honestly but I used to play I used to play the organ like the double decker pianos with top and bottom I used to play that when I was younger like way younger like five to ten and I can still kind of hunt and peck my way around a piano or whatever but if they were to do this so I could like refine my skills I am so there if I could like you know because I really enjoy it in Rock Band 3 I really do
3731510	3735613	Remember the keyboard mania that they had for the actual keyboard that was on PC?
3736053	3736493	Yeah, I do.
3736713	3736914	Yeah.
3737194	3739395	I didn't own it, but... Or what about Rock Band?
3739515	3740436	Did you ever play Rock Band 3?
3741036	3741897	Of course I played Rock Band 3.
3742137	3743378	I loved the keyboard mode in Rock Band 3.
3744158	3748942	Yeah, and then there was Keyboard Mania, of course, many years ago in Japan, and that was fun, too.
3749542	3753485	That was always my favorite of the Moani games, even though it was horribly neglected.
3754597	3756879	Anyhow, let's go to Japan and check out some games coming out over there.
3758300	3764246	Monster Hunter Frontier Online Forward 5 Premium Package on the Xbox 360 on the 17th.
3764806	3772513	That is also, I guess there's a bundle with Xbox Live points you can get too, I guess for some of the transactions in the game.
3772553	3776076	Well, I think Monster Hunter Online for them is actually a monthly fee.
3776596	3779199	Okay, so that's probably a points recurring fee.
3779819	3809431	Dance Central 3 gets a Japanese release on October 18th Darksiders 2 gets a Japanese release on October 18th as does FIFA 13 World Class Soccer again those are all Xbox 360 for the few 360 owners in Japan interesting about Dance Central 3 I'm imagining it's got to be the same song list I don't think they localize for you know the area or whatever so I don't like don't get excited if you're a J-pop fan I don't think there's anything to look for there but interesting that they got such a quick turnaround
3809761	3813865	It is very disappointing that they don't have Wild Wild West like they do in Just Dance 4.
3815907	3822833	On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 and FIFA 13 also coming there on the PlayStation 3 on the 18th.
3824014	3825696	Let's see, going to some of the handhelds.
3825896	3834324	On the Vita this week, FIFA 13 is there as well, and The Legend of Heroes Zero No Kisuke Evolution comes out on the PlayStation Vita.
3834464	3835705	Just saying, if you haven't bought
3836386	3840193	and the Vita version of FIFA 13, you may want to hold off.
3841416	3841897	Why is that?
3842257	3843580	It's exactly the same as FIFA 12.
3844121	3845884	Oh, I thought that was the Wii version.
3845925	3846406	Both of them.
3846746	3847367	Oh, no.
3848973	3849473	Bastards.
3850194	3855976	And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Project X Zone on October 19th from Namco Bandai.
3856116	3856776	That's pretty awesome.
3857096	3858717	Those are your Japanese release dates.
3860318	3864159	Alan, would you care to take us to the land of all things Britain?
3864479	3864799	Sure.
3865099	3865700	And UK-ish.
3865900	3871582	October 15th has The War Z, or The War Zed, coming out on PC.
3872582	3878685	October 17th we've got Serious Sam 3 BFE on Xbox 360 and The Unfinished Swan.
3879116	3901836	on PlayStation 3, 19th of October, 007 Legends on 360 and PS3, Dance Central 3 on the 360, Doom 3 BFG Edition on the 360, PS3, and PC, Madagascar 3, the video game, which I'm sure is going to be the best game released this year, because, you know, movie tie-in games are always phenomenal.
3902396	3907100	on 360, PS3, DS, PC, 3DS, and Wii.
3907680	3910762	Those big cross-platform juggernauts.
3911283	3912423	Rocksmith on PC.
3912904	3916626	Skylanders Giants on Wii, iPhone, 360, PS3, and PC.
3917167	3919188	Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.
3920569	3922270	And that is it.
3923431	3927534	Just a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3927994	3930916	DarkSakura isn't here, so we're taking over.
3931677	3932937	So see what we picked in a minute.
3933358	3934138	But first, Loki.
3935019	3937861	Apparently SingStar is going to be a free-to-play game pretty soon.
3938021	3946046	Which kind of makes sense, because when you buy SingStar, you kind of get some songs, but it's basically just a platform to buy more songs.
3946386	3948187	If you look at Rob's library, that shit ain't free.
3948648	3949148	Shut up.
3950629	3962201	Hey, don't be a jealous hater because I have SingStar ABBA, which is awesome, SingStar Queen, which is awesome, and SingStar 1 and 2 on the PlayStation 3, which are okay.
3962341	3964884	And how many songs a la carte that you've bought?
3965044	3965365	Enough.
3966946	3968087	Enough to have a party.
3968207	3970490	Enough to entertain my guests when there's a SingStar.
3970810	3973313	And I've been collecting them since I lived at that house with John.
3973673	3975555	We don't really have parties here in the tiny apartment.
3975855	3980260	But when I lived in the house with John where OLR was in the garage studio, we used to have SingStar parties.
3980360	3981481	We had a good time.
3982768	3984589	and a lot of those I bought on sale, to be fair.
3984629	3987210	I got SingStar Queen at the local flea market for like $8.
3987350	3988711	How are you going to say no to that?
3988851	3989391	And it was new.
3990171	3992412	It was brand new, still wrapped.
3993593	3996774	Apparently you still need the microphone, obviously, to play the game.
3997315	4004158	But I guess there is a message now popping up on the SingStar games.
4004438	4009200	They're basically saying the complete SingStar experience will be available as a free download very soon.
4010420	4010581	And...
4012621	4012901	and so on.
4039711	4041432	Maybe you don't like all of ABBA songs.
4041472	4042433	Maybe you only like a couple.
4042653	4046316	You buy a couple ABBA songs and you buy some Britney Spears or something.
4046536	4047197	I'm sorry.
4047577	4051340	Who the fuck is going to be satisfied with only a couple of ABBA songs?
4051720	4056423	If only a couple ABBA songs is what it takes to satisfy you, get out of here.
4056443	4059766	Maybe those people want to spend their money on Queen or something like that.
4062347	4064769	Look, if you're on a limited income, then I understand.
4064909	4065169	All right.
4065229	4069552	But you need to set up your monthly ABBA plan to get you on your path.
4071993	4072153	Yeah.
4072434	4072794	All right.
4072854	4073154	Whatever.
4076070	4076991	Good idea for Sony?
4077331	4078452	I think it's a good idea.
4078613	4079293	Might as well.
4079494	4081936	I mean, they haven't really done anything with SingStar in a while.
4081956	4087342	I think it's a good idea because it's going to get more exposure for people and because the SingStar games don't really sell that well.
4087702	4088923	I mean, they really don't.
4089324	4089884	They don't?
4090465	4091185	No, they don't.
4092583	4094584	I bet they do overseas a lot better.
4094924	4104168	They probably do overseas, but honestly, karaoke games don't do very well, but everybody's got a USB microphone, especially those wonderful Logitech microphones that they put in everything.
4104428	4106129	They work on pretty much all systems.
4106670	4113032	So you get one of those in a throwaway game, like Truth or Lies or something like that.
4113833	4114153	I don't know.
4114953	4118355	And you've got a SingStar mic.
4118455	4120036	Well, actually, no, the SingStar mics are different.
4120896	4125064	But still, I mean, you could find a bundle for SingStar for like dirt cheap somewhere.
4125385	4128892	I'm sure that like a GameStop or Walmart or something has them in their dump bin.
4128932	4130736	Just go looking for it.
4133280	4149604	Alright, well, let's move on to one more story about, you know, this always pisses people off when there's content on the disc that they call DLC, and you have to pay to unlock it, which, you know, we started using the term pay to unlock content instead of DLC for certain things.
4150145	4158607	Well, when it was discovered that Resident Evil 6 has some things locked away on the disc, everybody was like, oh, here we go again, Capcom!
4159087	4160747	Pay to unlock DLC!
4161568	4161888	But...
4162808	4178246	Apparently Capcom announced that the things that were found on the disc, including No Hope, Difficulty Level, and Co-op for Ada Wong's campaign, these will be freebies, and they will be a free title update coming soon.
4178767	4182311	So no word if they only made it free because they got caught, or...
4183252	4197484	All trolling aside, I can see the value of doing free DLC because it extends the life of your game past the first week, especially in the very busy holiday season where there are so many games competing for your attention.
4198825	4201447	I can actually see the value of this.
4202228	4207873	I can't believe I'm about to say this, but good on Capcom in this case.
4208733	4212635	Now it is coming out that there will be paid DLC, but it will not already be on the disc.
4212735	4213855	It's coming later.
4235416	4237598	So... Alright.
4238979	4244143	Let's move on to a time when there wasn't even a Resident Evil 1 yet.
4244363	4246545	I don't think when this game originally came out.
4246585	4247786	Maybe one was out.
4247826	4248126	I don't know.
4248146	4248467	There was.
4248647	4249047	There was a 1.
4249327	4249608	Alright.
4251069	4251609	But, okay.
4252030	4253991	Back when the Resident Evil series was good...
4255222	4256423	It was no download content.
4256443	4257244	It was all on this content.
4257264	4257684	That's right.
4257724	4259485	There was no download content.
4259525	4261367	When Resident Evil 2 was going to be on the N64.
4261387	4262528	Remember that?
4262588	4263228	Yes, I do.
4263349	4263689	I do.
4264229	4266031	It's a classic game of the week.
4266091	4268373	DarkSakura, she ain't here again.
4268773	4270854	So we've snatched her pick away from her.
4271275	4275758	And we've picked an awesome game in her place that we think you guys should be playing this week.
4275838	4277180	And we gave it to Alan this week.
4277240	4280082	So Alan, what is your classic game of the week?
4280102	4280182	Well,
4280562	4306657	usually when I do this segment I do like old Sierra Online PC games or like LucasArts so I wanted to give consoles love this time and I wanted to do something handheld because I don't think handheld gets that much love in this segment so I chose Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages for the Game Boy Color
4308323	4309364	They are super awesome.
4311685	4324714	Legend of Zelda Seasons and Ages came out together, obviously, because you can play one, you get this huge, massive password code that you then plug into the next game, and then you continue the story.
4325354	4337783	And once you beat both of the games, so you play one, you get your code, you play the other one, then you get to fight Ganon, who's the secret boss, and then you get to see Zelda proper, and you get the real ending.
4338823	4348250	and one of the big deals about this game was the fact that Nintendo did not develop or design it.
4348630	4356396	They let a subsidiary of Capcom called Flagship write and code and design the game and Nintendo simply published it.
4356436	4361820	And I think that may be one of the first times Nintendo has ever let a blue chip franchise
4363487	4364628	Be in the Hands of Someone Else.
4364849	4372056	Now it's not that rare, because Sega's done stuff, and there was that Metroid game that was done by Team Ninja.
4372437	4378463	This game came out in the US in May of 2001, which was the month of
4380385	4383807	before the Game Boy Advance console proper came out.
4383987	4390031	So this is one of the last games for the Game Boy Color before that generation was phased down, the Advance took over.
4390451	4398936	Some of the best Game Boy Color graphics that you'll probably ever see, and even looking on the YouTube, that looks pretty good.
4400757	4402739	It's like eight colors, I think, on the Game Boy Color?
4402839	4403159	Mm-hmm.
4404259	4410422	Yeah, so if you play one game, some of the items that you get are upgradable in the second game.
4411143	4416065	There are a lot of little side quests and little... Look at these little cartoony cutscenes, too.
4416225	4416425	Yeah.
4416585	4417245	For Game Boy Color.
4417345	4418386	Yeah.
4421255	4440356	If you play both games, depending on which order you play them in, you can upgrade certain items to a tier that you couldn't normally get if you bring all of your equipment and stuff over into the next game.
4441456	4452060	In Oracle of Ages there is a time mechanic where you speed up time or slow down time to get past to solve certain puzzles in the dungeons or on the overworld to actually get into the dungeon.
4452600	4460863	In Oracle of Seasons you have a rod that will if there's a river you'll make it winter and the water will freeze so you can cross the river.
4461623	4462163	Stuff like that.
4463104	4467185	Was this the game that had the advanced dungeons or was that one of the other Game Boy games?
4467265	4469906	That was Link's Awakening DX wasn't it?
4470845	4471005	I can't.
4493672	4494652	Yeah, I'm not sure about that.
4494672	4498013	I think you're thinking of the re-release of Link's Awakening.
4498213	4498794	Maybe I am.
4499194	4500474	Somebody in chat will correct me.
4500514	4502735	That's the lovely part of doing a live show.
4503155	4522581	One of the awesome things about the Legend of Zelda handheld games is that, and Nintendo, Miyamoto's even come out and said this, in the handheld Zelda games, they will allow themselves to do things with the franchise and with the mechanics and the story that they simply can't do on the console versions, because the console ones...
4523261	4523522	and so on.
4540094	4543915	You know, the three medallions, you're always going to have the Master Sword, you're always going to fight Ganon.
4543935	4547796	There are these staple things that are always in those games.
4547976	4562359	In the handheld ones, like Oracle of Seasons and Ages, Minish Cap, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, that's when they really get super creative with the world of Hyrule and the stuff that you can do.
4562999	4567180	They usually introduce a lot of new characters that you'll never really see again in the handheld games.
4569301	4576923	Link's Awakening, with the big, you know, the fish or whatever that's sleeping, that whole plot was inspired by Twin Peaks.
4578184	4578664	Do you know it?
4578704	4580184	Because you're a big Twin Peaks fan, right?
4580204	4580725	Yes, I do.
4580905	4585146	Yeah, so that's just, yeah, that's just an example of how the...
4586755	4614418	how Zelda really shines in a lot of unique ways on the handheld systems now I did some research and the advanced shop was Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons it was a shop it was not a dungeon I think I called it the advanced dungeon at first that's probably what confused you when these games are played on a Game Boy Advance there is a shop they have two seed rings and a gasha seed depending on the game it's either the GBA time ring or the GBA nature ring while the other is a random ring
4615458	4618500	Oh yeah, and oh, that's right, I remember it's right here in the article.
4619200	4627205	Since this was so close to the Game Boy Advance release, if you played it on the Advance in addition to that shop, the graphics were also much improved.
4627505	4638372	So they had, obviously not Game Boy Advance quality graphics, but the color palette and the clarity of the pixels, they actually was coded onto the Game Boy Color cartridge to be read by the Advance.
4638452	4638952	That's awesome.
4641145	4646588	If you look this up on YouTube, try to find the advanced run-throughs.
4647208	4650770	As far as how it played, again, it's Legend of Zelda.
4651971	4668819	If you've played Minish Cap, Link to the Past, the first Zelda game, overhead, big expansive map, you go into dungeons, you have to beat the dungeons in a certain order, because the items that you get in the dungeon, the treasure, is what you'll need to solve puzzles in the dungeons.
4669399	4670861	and so on and so forth.
4671881	4676585	The main antagonists, I believe, are Twinrova.
4676606	4678707	I think the double witches could be wrong there.
4678727	4680289	It's been so long since I played this.
4681249	4682130	But yeah, there are these...
4684332	4688836	The oracles are these ladies that you meet when you're transported to these new worlds.
4689257	4692440	These games don't take place in Hyrule like a lot of the handheld games.
4693340	4699886	So yeah, they are in danger, and there's... Naru is one, and Din, I think, is the other one.
4700307	4709696	So you rescue them, and then as you progress through, you beat the one game and you play the other one, you do figure out finally how Zelda and Ganon and the Triforce factor into it.
4710597	4714630	they're a lot of fun if you're a big Zelda fan and you haven't played these you're missing out
4715498	4715798	All right.
4715858	4716318	Good pick.
4716578	4720980	Your classic game of the week, The Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Ages, and Oracle of Seasons.
4721040	4722141	Two games for the price of one.
4723201	4723381	Yes.
4723921	4724201	All right.
4724281	4725102	Thank you very much, Alan.
4725122	4725462	Good pick.
4726402	4727422	I think Jamie would be happy.
4728583	4728883	All right.
4728903	4730744	Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show.
4730784	4731384	But don't go anywhere.
4731424	4740307	We've got plenty more show to come when we get back, including some rapid-fire news, the Fugo question of the week, and some interesting rumors about Miyamoto's new direction.
4740407	4740707	Hmm.
4741388	4741548	And...
4742268	4745851	An event coming up appropriately named Fuck This Jam.
4745951	4746772	We'll talk about that.
4746812	4747552	It's not our event.
4747592	4748233	It's somebody else's.
4748553	4753497	We'll talk about that a little more when we come back after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4759545	4761166	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4782659	4783259	Outro Music Outro Music
4807367	4808007	You didn't see it?
4808588	4812370	When they did the galloping horse, it blew my fucking mind.
4812490	4814812	I know, it was really amazing some of the stuff they were doing.
4814872	4824498	Now, you know, having done field shows in the past before, and I'm sure Bobby can attest to this too, I'm sure we're not the only band nerds that happen to be into video games and all that.
4824518	4827400	I'm sure there's plenty more band nerds out there listening to this show.
4827900	4834444	But it is a lot of work, because you not only have to memorize songs, but you have to memorize where on the field you're going.
4834965	4835385	It's not...
4835825	4836806	Thank you for watching!
4856297	4885238	Jessica Harper from Under Station Live is in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and says I was however the drum major my senior year I feel like she's told me that before and I forgot and that's awesome because I tried out to be drum major but I wasn't picked somebody else was picked I'm a drum major reject and now look at me I'm on a podcast about video games on the internet anyhow drum major reject laughs
4885538	4887762	I'm glad Jessica could achieve where I clearly failed miserably
4896314	4900378	Alright, I apologize again for my voice, you guys.
4900498	4902239	I am kind of struggling through tonight's show.
4902720	4912068	I've already had a hot cup of coffee and a throat coke cup of tea, and it'll fix it for about 30 seconds, and then I go back to, my voice is kind of scratchy.
4912889	4913829	So I will do my best.
4913849	4921816	This is like the worst possible thing that can happen to a radio guy, but I will do my best to try to get through the next couple hours here, or not next couple hours, but next hour or so.
4922877	4927478	of the show for you guys because we have plenty more gaming news to talk about.
4927498	4929798	And we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news, right, Loki?
4930278	4931159	That is correct.
4931799	4936180	So let's talk a little bit about this really cool sale that they've got on Amazon right now.
4936820	4940540	It's a bunch of Square Enix games, and I think it's a great deal.
4940640	4949342	It's $10, and you basically get Deus Ex Human Revolution Augmented Edition plus the Missing Link DLC, Hitman Blood Money, Just Cause 2, Just Cause,
4949922	4955045	Quantum Conundrum, Supreme Commander 2, and The Last Remnant for $10.
4956186	4959308	And the sale is running through October 20th.
4959928	4962790	It expires at 11.59 p.m.
4962850	4963870	Pacific Standard Time.
4963950	4968453	So go get it because, I mean, that's seriously a great price.
4968533	4973436	Yes, this is a sale we were referring to in Part A, and I got to say, kind of want, actually.
4973476	4977158	Yeah, it's called the Absolutely Great Square Pack from Amazon.
4977498	4999632	and these are all the PC yeah the last remnant which you know was their exclusive RPG for the 360 which was a huge pile of shit if you have a good PC it plays fine so the technical issues that it had on the 360 are on PC and you should actually play that game because it's good and no one would ever know because it was so awful on the 360 so Overlooked Square RPG
5000519	5003220	Actdeft in our chatroom says Amazon won't let me buy it.
5003341	5005201	I wonder if that's the Mexico thing.
5005482	5008023	Maybe it's a deal that's only good in the US.
5009163	5012345	That kind of sucks for those that are in other countries.
5012405	5013005	I'm sorry.
5013846	5014806	I don't know what else to say.
5014906	5015466	It sucks.
5016067	5018028	Actually, you know what?
5018328	5019508	It may not be available anymore.
5019528	5020809	It says currently unavailable.
5021669	5022870	Maybe it sold out.
5023170	5024690	Maybe so many people jumped on it.
5024710	5025571	And here's the thing, too.
5026291	5026751	This is weird.
5027031	5031393	The DRM on it was Steam, so you were getting some sort of codes or something.
5032373	5033494	For a lot of games.
5033574	5034274	Oh, wait, wait.
5034674	5035334	I see it right here.
5035434	5036415	Actually, no, I'm sorry.
5036535	5040696	It says unavailable, but then there was this buy and download thing.
5041057	5043217	Let's try clicking that just out of curiosity.
5043958	5044658	Just come on.
5046078	5047199	Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
5050962	5076734	uh no it will not let me during some of Steam's really insane you know 99 cent sales this happened with GTA 4 and um the you know Ballad of Gay Tony they had a note um we don't have codes so we ran out of all our codes so we have to contact Rockstar Games for like 20,000 more codes that could be the issue that's happening here well they may have had limited copies and then once they hit all the blocks and well that sucks
5079016	5089542	Alpha Cananogram in chat is saying, don't know if Loki said, but feel free to use the code SQRLUVIO to take $2 off any digital video games purchase.
5089883	5093185	Code will expire when this product becomes available for purchase again.
5093805	5097788	I wonder if that means Amazon didn't intend for this to happen or something weird's going on.
5098548	5099849	Yeah, I don't have that code either.
5100729	5101190	Very strange.
5101210	5101870	You didn't give me any code.
5102470	5103191	These bastards.
5103471	5104131	I don't know.
5105052	5105332	All right.
5106033	5108414	Well, I bet you're mad for waiting now.
5108754	5109795	Yeah.
5109875	5110375	Check tomorrow.
5110435	5111196	Oh, no, I do see that.
5111256	5114878	Yeah, it says currently out of keys, back in stock soon, $2 promo.
5115118	5115898	There it is.
5116018	5116459	There it is.
5116499	5117419	There's right, yay.
5118920	5119220	Yeah.
5119700	5124323	So, well, just give it some time and keep checking back, I guess.
5125284	5127485	But, oh, well, great deal either way.
5129269	5129629	All right.
5129809	5135356	And then, of course, we have to talk a little bit about some DLC and Sleeping Dogs.
5135376	5137358	They're going to have quite a bit of DLC soon.
5137738	5142123	Starting next week, they're getting some street racing DLC.
5142163	5146568	It's going to add some new street races in the game, I guess, for $4.
5147149	5148050	That's what it's going to run you.
5149051	5151453	It's going to have three new races across Land and Sea.
5152314	5160259	And also, I guess, there's some new Street Racer DLC that they're... I guess they're adding a new motorcycle as well.
5161400	5166464	And a new outfit that boosts, I guess, Defense Against Gunfire and Accidents.
5167164	5171447	Then there's also going to be some DLC on the 30th that's...
5174049	5174990	Nightmare in Northport
5199798	5200579	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5219537	5220758	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5248775	5254161	And really, if you played Borderlands 1 and played all the DLC in it, you know it's going to be good.
5255683	5258406	I'm sure that the DLC will be pretty awesome.
5258446	5265033	I'm still waiting to hear on how it goes and maybe I'll have to plunk down the $30 for a season pass.
5266721	5268062	XCOM Enemy Unknown
5283996	5288340	Well, there's a pretty nifty Easter egg in the game that allows you to bring in super soldiers.
5288761	5292904	You can put in certain names and they activate XCOM heroes.
5293505	5293805	I don't know.
5293825	5301352	For some reason, it makes me think of NBA Jam when you could put in certain combinations that would unlock Bill Clinton and Scorpion and shit.
5301433	5302073	That was awesome.
5302133	5302994	That was awesome.
5303114	5303955	So I don't know.
5304275	5306818	But here's the type of people you can unlock here.
5307518	5308299	Sid Meier.
5309720	5334814	Ken Levine I think that's awesome that they put Sid Meier in there Joe Kelly and Otto Zander are apparently all super soldiers so far apparently the one little trick to it is that once you summon the heroes the achievements are turned off so if you want to go for achievements don't use this little cheat but maybe once you've beat the game and got the achievements you want go back and play as Sid Meier for the lols
5336707	5337227	Thanks for watching!
5357098	5384520	he's teamed up with an animator friend to make Street Fighter 3 for Inkazon it's a fan flick and it looks really really nice especially in these little posters it looks like even better than like I don't like Frankenweenie or one of those movies that's like in theaters it's a really neat art style kind of impressive that it's only these two guys even more impressive that Capcom hasn't shut it down yet but maybe the fact that they are in Brazil makes it complicated
5385520	5386121	Good luck to them.
5407036	5415339	Much like animals in the real world, Pokemon are treated as unfeeling objects and used for things as human entertainment and as subjects in experiments.
5415759	5428864	The way the Pokemon are stuffed into Pokeballs is similar to how circuses chain elephants inside railroad cars and let them out only to perform confusing and awful painful tricks that were taught using sharp steel-tipped bullhooks and electric shock prods.
5429504	5435071	If PETA existed in UNOVA, our motto would be, Pokemon are not ours to use or abuse.
5435391	5436893	They exist for their own reasons.
5437214	5439777	We believe that this is the message that should be sent to children.
5440996	5447381	Now, I just want to remind you guys, PETA is clearly trolling with this.
5448262	5449182	Look at that statement.
5450343	5454046	Over half of the statement had nothing to do with the game they were putting out.
5454707	5459531	They used half that statement to talk about the whole circus and the elephants and all that stuff.
5460271	5485747	it is all about attention I mean clearly they play Pokemon they understand Pokemon because they know about like the Pokemon world they said if PETA existed in Unova they didn't say if PETA existed in the Pokemon universe or if PETA ruled Nintendo these people know what the fuck they're doing by getting attention congratulations you picked the right week to do it at least if nothing else Alan
5486900	5495625	I played PETA's Cooking Mama game from Thanksgiving, and whoever they contract to do their Shockwave games, some of them are actually kind of good.
5495885	5505629	That almost is the reason why these things are worth covering, because as much as they are troll-y and it's like you just roll your eyes at PETA, they're high-quality trolls.
5509331	5514053	Yeah, because the Cooking Mama one was how to make like a tofurkey in the like vegan Thanksgiving.
5514613	5516293	And you know, you click and drag the food ingredients.
5516313	5519114	I'm like, this is a pretty well done little shockwave game.
5520555	5520855	Yeah.
5522815	5524816	Do you remember playing on the Genesis ToeJam & Earl?
5525865	5536615	because I do, the sequel, ToeJam & Earl, and Panic on Funkatron are going to hit the PSN and XBLA online stores on November 6th and 7th, respectively.
5537115	5544001	I never played this because I was, at the time, I was at the age where I was really kind of butthurt.
5544582	5551728	Basically, it's a 2D side-scrolling platformer, and the original ToeJam & Earl was like an overhead sort of adventure game.
5552729	5578539	and uh so yeah if you're a fan of Toa Jam and Earl and want some vintage uh Genesis nostalgia pick that up November 6th and 7th uh God of War Ascension which is the next God of War game because you know they're not going to let that franchise die off the demo is going to be in the Total Recall remake the one with Colin whatever his name is um uh that comes out on
5580299	5581579	Oh boy, December 18th.
5581999	5584900	So get the Total Recall Blu-ray Play God of War Ascension.
5584980	5589782	And that is going to be the only way to get that demo until four days before the game comes out.
5590002	5595843	I think like March 8th is when they're putting the demo on PSN and then the game comes out on March 12th of next year.
5596543	5602485	And the graphics for it, just looking at these screenshots, look really like disgustingly awesome.
5603277	5604258	Very God of War-ish.
5604418	5604678	Yes.
5606159	5611722	Finally, the game Injustice Gods Among Us, which I will admit I don't really know much about.
5612302	5613963	It's being put out by NetherRealm.
5615725	5617265	It has a DC Comics character in it.
5617366	5624530	It's going to be Green Arrow, who some people might remember, like, you know, the show Supernatural, which finally ended after, like, 11 seasons that had Green Arrow in it.
5625090	5627852	It's the Green Arrow I think that's best known.
5627892	5629132	Wait, Supernatural's not done.
5629312	5630233	It's still on the air, isn't it?
5630293	5631173	Oh, I meant Smallville.
5631313	5631713	I'm sorry.
5631894	5633154	Smallville, Superman.
5633694	5636416	And now there's an Arrow series on CW.
5636716	5638917	Either it just started last week or it's starting this week.
5638937	5639698	Oh, is it a spinoff?
5639758	5640498	Is it the same actor?
5640518	5643219	Yeah, I think they're trying to make Smallville lightning strike twice.
5643479	5644760	Yeah.
5646001	5648682	So yeah, Green Arrow is going to be a character in Injustice Gods Among Us.
5650083	5650443	There you go.
5651638	5656200	Again, it's the Justice League outfit, I believe, from the Cartoon Network show.
5656580	5659101	Shayna Linko in chat says, different actor, sadly.
5660202	5661743	Oh, well, that's just unfortunate.
5663063	5664444	Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat.
5664584	5666085	I want to go back to the PETA thing for a minute.
5666125	5668846	Remember, they're delayed, so sometimes it takes time for them to comment on things.
5669426	5672708	Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder what PETA thinks of Tokyo Jungle.
5673248	5676910	Wouldn't they hate the fact that you play as animals eating other animals?
5677990	5687075	Again, this is proof that they're trolling because, you know, obviously Tokyo Jungle is the game to take issue with, but they know that Tokyo Jungle is a niche thing.
5687215	5690857	No one care about Tokyo Jungle, but what's a game that everybody talks about?
5691077	5691718	Pokemon.
5692298	5694359	Anyway, I'm giving this story far too much attention.
5694459	5697561	I just wanted to address that comment because it was worth commenting on.
5697581	5707246	I don't think they really have a problem with people or with animals eating other animals because that just happens in the wild, but as long as it's not people eating other animals, that's really the issue there.
5708163	5714255	So by that logic, would they be okay with people eating other people?
5715317	5718343	Yes, because they're only for the ethical treatment of animals.
5718684	5719305	Nothing about people.
5719798	5720178	Oh, okay.
5720919	5721960	Just wanted to make sure that was clear.
5721980	5726203	Unfortunately, pet doesn't exist.
5726283	5728665	We need a people for the ethical treatment of people.
5728985	5729626	That's what we need.
5729686	5736932	That's the foundation we really... I sound like such an asshole because it sounds like I'm saying fuck animals and that's not really what I'm saying.
5737612	5742737	But I think we should have a... What about how we treat each other?
5742877	5744358	Isn't that important as well?
5745619	5745919	Anyhow...
5747680	5749201	Again, giving it far too much credit.
5749241	5751242	You know what deserves more credit on our show?
5752102	5754183	Our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.
5756544	5758025	It's the Foogle question of the week.
5758085	5760646	Take Facebook and Google and put it together and you get Foogle.
5762386	5763907	And the question of the week this week.
5766350	5769694	Kind of a little play on the fact that I've been on vacation for a little bit.
5770915	5773238	Everybody's done it at some point in their life or another.
5773558	5778863	What is the worst thing you've missed in real life so you can stay at home and play a video game?
5779364	5781766	Did work get in the way of a Final Fantasy launch?
5782247	5786391	Did you stay at home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of going to your friend's birthday party?
5787952	5789673	Excuse me, hiccup, bad time.
5790894	5792175	Worst nightmare for a radio person.
5792655	5796177	Do you stay home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of going to your friend's birthday party?
5796957	5800059	Let's go to some of the answers on Google, starting with Actdeft.
5800420	5803041	I don't recall missing anything serious for a video game.
5803181	5808164	I have come close, though, like almost missing class to get a Dreamcast on Black Friday.
5808404	5810466	Remember, I'm from Mexico and we don't have Thanksgiving here.
5811446	5811927	Thanks for watching!
5827449	5829110	Sean F replied on Google Plus.
5829671	5831232	Yes, there are people on Google Plus.
5832113	5833013	I have to say that every week.
5833654	5842261	And said, I wish I had a terrible secret to reveal, but I think the worst I ever did was I took the day off in 2005 when I got a PSP at midnight release.
5842681	5844162	Wipe out pure and luminous.
5844643	5845644	Good times.
5846805	5847785	Indeed, good times.
5848866	5852889	Let's go to Facebook and get some answers to the question there in our Facebook community.
5854110	5855792	Starting off with
5859197	5872012	Critical Myth says, I've been far more likely to miss things like company Christmas parties to see Lord of the Rings premieres, but a friend of mine skipped his own performance review to stand in line for the 360.
5873273	5874575	He still got promoted.
5876141	5878342	skipped his performance review at work to get a 360.
5878382	5879722	That's a pretty good one.
5879762	5883663	He must have known he was going to get a good review and could get away with murder with his boss.
5884403	5890405	Degenerated Johnny, excuse me, says, I was leading my first raid in Molten Core during Vanilla WoW.
5890965	5895667	Unfortunately, the raid was during the time I was supposed to pick my mother up from the airport.
5896307	5899288	She was coming back from a trip to her homeland of Scotland.
5899728	5903549	This resulted with her being stuck at the airport for two hours.
5904389	5905610	Even if it was through force, right?
5905630	5906011	Haseo Summer...
5926351	5928032	Excuse me, sorry guys, the voice is going.
5928312	5929993	Haseo Sumiragawa says,
5953048	5957011	Dark Tetsuya says, I actually skipped school the day I got the original PlayStation.
5957512	5961174	Ironically, ran into my high school tutor at the time, who didn't seem to mind.
5961395	5962415	Yes, I did graduate.
5963356	5966659	And lastly, Chiggers on Facebook says, never happened.
5967499	5970121	In real life is always more important than a game.
5970542	5974945	The game will always be there, but real life experience only happens once.
5976688	5979212	Oh you, what a party pooper answer.
5980434	5981075	I'm just kidding.
5981777	5983740	That's something we probably should remember.
5983840	5985342	Anybody in here with a story to share?
5985382	5988027	What's the worst thing you skipped out on in real life to play a video game?
5988167	5988327	Alan?
5992230	5996151	I did some all-nighters when I was in high school where I just didn't go to bed.
5996872	6001633	I just played a game and then when it was time to go to school, I went to school because when you're 16, 17, you can do that shit.
6001694	6006635	Your body's like, fine, I'll be up for, you know, 36 hours until eventually you can crash.
6007636	6018140	But as far as missing, I mean, when the PS2 came out, I went to bed at like 8 in the evening, got up at 1 or 2 in the morning,
6019540	6024804	I walked, I think, two or three miles to Target, got in line at Target at like 4 a.m.
6026746	6027667	There was already a line.
6027807	6037735	I got PS2, I think, 38 out of 43, so my timing couldn't have been any more flawless from wanting to actually avoid camping the entire night out.
6038536	6039556	And then I went into work.
6040397	6046262	Once I actually bought the thing, I think I was in the office by, I want to say, 10 or 11 in the morning, but I already cleared it with my boss the night before, so...
6048362	6050383	I've never done anything that scandalous.
6051784	6053366	I don't really think I've taken it.
6053726	6056808	Have I taken a day off work to play a game?
6057949	6059490	If I did, I honestly do not remember.
6060538	6084948	I took a day off work to play World of Warcraft but to be fair I ended up having a Disneyland trip and I would have taken the day off anyway but I guess my real answer would be that I cut a lot of class in college to play Final Fantasy 7 it was real good and I was really into it I was more into it than some of my classes I had at the time
6085740	6086941	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6104177	6117481	Um, I skipped work while I took time off for, um, Grand Theft Auto, well, recently it was, well, actually it wasn't that recent, but Grand Theft Auto 4, uh, to try to get 100% on everything so I could get the keys to the city.
6118021	6126583	Which I technically did within the time frame that they had in the whole contest thing, but they only had a limited amount of keys and it wasn't registering the information correctly.
6126603	6131605	There was a huge delay, so I unfortunately didn't get the keys to the city, but, um...
6132906	6150703	I got the achievement for 100% though I took time off work when Final Fantasy XI came out I remember that, I was so jazzed for that game I totally took the day off when that came out too That was years ago I didn't skip work, I just took the day off So I guess it's not as bad if you planned it in advance, right?
6150783	6152805	I'd probably take the day off work for Grand Theft Auto V
6154949	6155410	in the future.
6155771	6156231	In the future.
6156312	6157053	Planning for 2013.
6157854	6162102	Alright, we have some more news stories for you guys and then we'll get your Skype calls here in a little bit.
6163075	6168917	All right, so there's this new patent from Sony for a controller.
6169057	6177841	Right now, at least in the diagram, it shows a PlayStation Move controller, but apparently it's a controller that allows the user to feel temperature change.
6178321	6192126	So, for example, the controller could get hotter, like if your gun overheats or you get hit by a fireball or you're in an area where there's fire or something like that, or colder, you know, if you're in an icy area or something.
6193026	6198528	and, um, it kind of like a temperature feedback as well as like, you know, how they have the force feedback and stuff.
6199268	6200989	So, neat.
6201209	6214594	I don't know if it's necessarily something that they're going to be, um, implementing into a move controller or something like that soon, but, um, you know, it's kind of cool to have this technology around for whenever you may use it in the future.
6214794	6216795	I mean, for some new controller or something, but...
6217735	6222136	I don't know if it'd be a big deal, like, you know, a controller got cold and went into an icy area.
6222156	6223896	It'd be kind of, haha, that's neat.
6224636	6226697	I'd like to leave it cold all the time, you know.
6227277	6228557	Sometimes your hands get sweaty.
6228937	6231358	Maybe you should detect whether your hands are sweaty and then cool off.
6232098	6233998	There's a third-party company idea right there.
6236439	6241800	If PlayStation had indie games, somebody would release an indie game that's called Hand Warmer.
6245307	6246848	and then the sequel, Hand Freezer.
6247148	6248409	You know who needs this technology?
6249369	6251330	Microsoft for the Xbox 360.
6252111	6252311	Why?
6252731	6257434	When it detects it's getting hot, it gets colder so that the system doesn't crash.
6258335	6258855	Oh, okay.
6258875	6259715	I see what you did there.
6260136	6260636	That's good.
6260796	6262177	Or it's just water cool everything.
6262257	6262557	I don't know.
6263021	6265743	Well, it wouldn't be hard for the PlayStation controller to get hot.
6265803	6272087	They could just put in there whatever they put in iPhones because the iPhones get really hot if you're using it too much.
6273628	6277210	When it's really straining for a signal, I notice it gets really hot.
6278231	6278992	That's how they could do it.
6281954	6284435	Maybe they could implement this into the iPhone.
6285896	6290119	When you piss off Siri by asking a bunch of stupid questions, it'll just melt down into your hand.
6292900	6294062	I'm going to burn your hand now.
6294423	6294965	That's right.
6295366	6296308	Wrong answer.
6297872	6298493	Punishing games.
6298513	6301060	I think it's kind of dumb.
6302808	6306011	This would be something that you'd add to haptics later on.
6306051	6308073	But let's get the haptics thing out of the way first.
6309093	6313477	I think more people would be interested in touching things rather than... Oh, it's cold now.
6314858	6319042	First off, actually, challenge number one, getting people to buy the move.
6319422	6320563	That's challenge number one.
6320843	6325827	Challenge two, implementing temperature change in there and having people be interested.
6326067	6330771	And seriously, how is temperature change going to come in handy in Just Dance 4 or like...
6332293	6337458	I don't know, archery and sports champions or... Maybe this is why the last Guardian got delayed.
6337518	6338979	Maybe he's guarding temperature.
6342202	6342703	I don't know.
6343043	6346146	Maybe it's because it's going to be a launch title on another system or something.
6347608	6349029	Alright, or maybe it's nothing.
6350070	6355235	Maybe it's just somebody had the idea and it was like, you know what, let's patent it just in case Nintendo's thinking of something.
6357372	6360853	Well, this is an interesting little rumor that's going around.
6361414	6365976	Take it with a grain of salt because it's spawned from a NeoGAF post, but you never know.
6366116	6367476	Sometimes where there's smoke, there's fire.
6367536	6375760	Sometimes, rumor is, Shigeru Miyamoto is expected to leave Nintendo's EAD division by December.
6375840	6377841	How many times has this rumor been around?
6377881	6383483	I mean, seriously, there was another rumor that he, this was like a couple months ago, that it was the same damn thing.
6408417	6433032	A major shift in Kyoto development sources involving three research and development buildings New groups and new producers being announced for EAD Kyoto and SPD Kyoto A Tokyo expansion of EAD and Mashihiro Sakurai possibly joining EAD Tokyo New division led by Miyamoto with younger staff focused on smaller scale games
6434338	6463165	Miyamoto's departure inspiring new IPs for the EAD Kyoto division and Cliffy B going to EAD Tokyo I added the last one myself I added that one myself I was just waiting for Cliffy B come on I had to throw my own wank on there too why not everybody else is maybe that's a list list Nintendo wank best Nintendo wank come on let's make up a Nintendo rumor come on come on Alan make up a Nintendo rumor
6465527	6473715	Wii U will use points like XBLA and have DRM.
6475757	6476117	Yeah, see?
6476157	6476337	Yeah.
6486403	6488687	Uh... Nintendo Wank.
6488707	6489368	Let's see.
6489388	6489509	Uh... Ugh.
6499485	6500386	I don't know, this is tough.
6500786	6501967	It's tough to come up with something stupid.
6502127	6502788	Okay, fine, fine.
6502928	6505570	People pull this shit out of their ass all day long.
6505590	6512116	I know, but I have to be selective when I pull out of my ass to make it sound a little bit more legitimate than the other people that pull stuff out of their ass.
6512736	6513137	That's the thing.
6513157	6514578	That's why I was giving it some thought there.
6514678	6519462	So, Loki, the man who works for the distributor, what is Nintendo going to do next?
6519863	6520543	What are you posting?
6520563	6524887	They're going to fake another shortage on the goddamn Wii U system to create an artificial demand.
6526288	6527109	That's not a rumor.
6528399	6532523	Oh, no, did you hear what... No, this actually didn't make our show, but did you hear what their fucking excuse was?
6532623	6537508	There was a fire in a production plant, and I guess that lowered their amount of units that they're going to put out by like a million or something.
6537528	6540691	Isn't that the same excuse they used for the gasoline prices going up?
6540972	6542773	Yeah, there was a fire in a production plant.
6542874	6544135	Goddamn, we used... We're there.
6544175	6545756	Why do we store them next to the oil?
6545817	6547278	But, you know...
6547638	6555082	Alpha Cananigram and Chat wants to remind me they did get rid of the points because the Nintendo 3DS eShop does use regular money for currency.
6555222	6556263	Yeah, they got rid of those cards.
6557083	6557564	Whatever.
6557584	6558464	You know what they're going to do?
6558484	6559285	I have a Nintendo rumor.
6559545	6559805	Okay.
6560325	6560926	Yes, thank you.
6561426	6563387	Their online integration is going to be really mediocre.
6565268	6566309	These aren't rumors!
6567709	6568530	3DS Micro.
6569330	6571472	It's small enough to fit in your pocket now.
6572842	6583668	And to take inspiration from Apple, they're going to make their next 3DS super wide so they can have yet another attachment for the stupid... Have you seen the LL and XL?
6583788	6587009	Have you seen the... I was like, okay, we made it bigger.
6587069	6588070	We could have put a thumb pad here.
6588090	6593192	But no, we're going to have an even larger thing that's going to attach to it and make it even wider than it was.
6593292	6594433	Is that really happening?
6594733	6595714	Yes, it's really happening.
6595814	6596274	Okay.
6596294	6596774	Is it out yet?
6597255	6599736	I think it's coming out in Japan if it's not out already.
6599816	6600036	Okay.
6600657	6601117	It's very soon.
6601137	6601938	They have pictures of it.
6602538	6603419	And it's not Photoshop.
6603459	6607541	It's like this is an official thing because, you know, you want the larger thing.
6607781	6614546	I mean, seriously, it's just – let me just add another, like, half of a laptop right here, and I'll put just a giant, like, analog.
6614646	6615186	I should do that.
6615206	6616167	You know, make a project.
6616187	6618668	You have this analog stick that's just, like, the size of my hand.
6618708	6618828	Yeah.
6620209	6625734	It'll look like that Tetris game at Golf Land with the gigantic joystick that you use to move the pieces.
6625754	6626295	Have you seen that?
6626335	6627155	The Sega Tetris?
6627175	6628797	I'm surprised no one's actually sold one of those.
6628877	6630678	It's like a home thing.
6632760	6633421	It could be fun.
6633821	6634442	It could be fun.
6635022	6635383	All right.
6636984	6637604	Let's move on.
6637725	6639226	Alan, do you have some legitimate news for us?
6640553	6643376	Kickstarter, everyone's favorite controversial crowdsource.
6643396	6645738	I said legitimate.
6645898	6649682	It's going live in the UK on Halloween.
6650122	6651464	It's going to be a part of the same site.
6651504	6655447	There is not going to be some Kickstarter-UK.com.
6655487	6656488	It's just Kickstarter.
6656929	6661413	But if you're within the UK, you can now put up your project online.
6661713	6691157	obviously the currency available is going to be listed in pounds doesn't say anything about euros here yeah you can set your goal and your stretch goals and I imagine if you're in the US and you want you see something awesome over in the UK you can bid on it like you can any other Kickstarter but yeah they got the payment and the those sketchy you know legal financial stuff sorted out so yay UK you're getting Kickstarter sure they're all very excited that's all I got there you go
6694262	6698907	I guess they got their legal stuff worked out, but there was already, you know, the other... So, whatever.
6701354	6706638	Have fun getting addicted to Kickstarter or hating on it or whatever side of the fence you choose to be on.
6707518	6710060	As diverse as we are on this show, have fun with that, UK.
6711581	6712862	So Borderlands sold a lot of copies.
6713723	6714743	How many copies?
6715164	6715404	Oh, shit.
6715584	6716264	1.4 million copies.
6716365	6717165	That's a lot of copies.
6717205	6717886	That's a success.
6719046	6719727	60 bucks a pop.
6719747	6720828	That's a lot of money.
6721008	6721468	Exactly.
6721768	6727192	And, of course, also that I believe it sold, I can't remember what percent, 234% more than the first game.
6730134	6731937	So at launch, that's pretty awesome.
6732798	6736224	Not so awesome, NBA Baller Beats, which sold 3000 copies.
6740000	6740620	Wait a minute.
6740680	6744742	You mean there wasn't a market for basketball and music fusion games?
6745162	6746543	Basketball, yeah, exactly.
6746703	6755828	Basketball, you know, it's a Kinect game that requires you to have a floor that you're not in an apartment and that the floor is like hardwood or something.
6756108	6757568	Here's the ironic twist.
6758069	6760770	Now it's a collector's item when it sells that few copies.
6761851	6762431	No, it's not.
6764468	6766870	That's like saying that the Eye of Judgment is a collector's item.
6767330	6767670	It's not.
6767690	6768831	It kind of is in a way.
6768991	6773454	The Borderlands, that is only hard copies of the game.
6773695	6777217	I think this is saying digital distribution is not in that figure at all.
6777257	6778278	So that's even more awesome for them.
6778498	6779619	Yeah, that's awesome.
6779659	6782821	Unfortunately, the digital version of NBA Baller Beats doesn't exist.
6782921	6785563	So I can't use that to inflate the numbers there.
6785871	6792293	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to remind us NBA Baller Beats had 50,000 Twitter followers.
6792373	6793213	Remember that whole thing?
6793653	6797654	So how did they only sell 3,000 copies of the game with 50,000 Twitter followers?
6797834	6801755	Do you mean to tell me they had fake Twitter followers?
6801815	6802035	It wasn't 50,000.
6802795	6805376	It was 500,000 Twitter followers.
6805836	6811557	Yeah, it's 500,000 because I think they have 100,000 for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 or something like that.
6811937	6813878	Yes, they bought their Twitter followers.
6814733	6815954	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
6817916	6822560	You mean to tell me that they bought all those Twitter followers?
6823180	6824041	Yes, they did.
6824121	6825662	There was an article in the Penny Arcade.
6825682	6827464	449,631 followers and they sold 3,000 copies of the game?
6827544	6829065	Yeah, because all those guys are really legit.
6835000	6840724	You know what's great is even after all that they're like, we didn't buy those followers.
6841464	6843546	You know, people are really excited about this game.
6843846	6844606	Okay, really?
6846067	6848589	You know what game sold better than NBA Baller Beats?
6849309	6850010	President Cat.
6852472	6869690	The Eye of Judgment The Eye of Judgment Sold better than NBA Baller Beats Oh, I feel like this is a game on like the $25,000 pyramid or something Or Family Feud or something Name a game that sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats Ready?
6870230	6873313	Go Barbie Horse Adventures 2
6877219	6879261	Probably not yet, but we will hit that mark.
6879361	6883244	Bungie Ferret Tossing will sell better than NBA Baller Beats.
6885286	6887307	Tokyo Jungle will sell more than NBA Baller Beats.
6887347	6890350	Oh, I'm sure it already has.
6890950	6891771	Let's see.
6891911	6896534	Secrets of the Mystical Unicorn, the game with the pink anus on Steam, has probably sold more than 3,000 copies.
6897867	6901751	I'm trying to think what was the worst game I can think of that's a paid game.
6902652	6903993	Worst game ever.
6906296	6908358	Night Trap sold more than NBA Baller Beats.
6909399	6913483	I was going to say Bullet Witch sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
6914064	6919029	Master Chu and the Drunk Nard Who on the NES probably sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
6920305	6925529	Hell, even like Steel Battalion, that last one that came out, sold more than that.
6925549	6926110	The $400 Xbox game?
6926150	6927691	And it was fucking broken.
6928471	6932154	Oh, Beatmania sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
6932775	6933575	Oh, burn!
6936137	6938880	Poppin' Music on Xbox Live Arcade, or what was it called?
6939160	6942923	Beat and Groovy sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
6943959	6944299	Guccigucci
6968562	6997717	Gucci Gucci hold on I want to look this up hold on it was just it was just the single yeah please don't play it do you really hate your listeners that much um no it was don't ask it was just a single last year but she actually put out a full album with that song and no one gave a fuck but more people gave a fuck okay so more people gave a fuck about this song no no not oh that's not it sorry it's uh oh this one yeah okay more people bought this cd than bought baller beats
7001947	7002631	Outro Music
7010390	7011091	This is really bad.
7011111	7011871	This is too long.
7011911	7012692	Where's the chorus?
7012792	7014233	I can't make it to the chorus.
7014253	7017096	You probably picked the worst part of the song to... Whatever.
7039714	7041535	So there you go, the worst part of the worst song.
7042136	7043256	Worst part of the worst song.
7043356	7052822	And yeah, and DarkSakura says that song was probably in NBA Baller Beats.
7052862	7055363	Let's see, Actdeft says more people bought E.T.
7055463	7057524	on the 2600 than NBA Baller Beats.
7057945	7062687	Jessica Harper said Britney's dance beat probably sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
7063408	7064248	Oh, Ranma.
7064889	7066209	Oh, burn.
7066590	7067250	This, oh, ouch.
7068171	7068391	Ouch.
7069295	7073297	Rock Revolution sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
7073377	7074718	That's a fact.
7075258	7076479	Oh, ouch.
7076719	7077299	Oh, you win.
7077520	7078360	You win in internet.
7079321	7080161	This story's over.
7083183	7083683	Marissa.
7084383	7085164	I love Marissa.
7085484	7085944	I really do.
7086024	7086985	And she's in our chat room.
7087205	7090687	And she just said, this bitch just rapped about Adderall.
7095182	7096623	By the way, does this still work?
7097024	7098065	I just want to point this out.
7098145	7101288	I want Marissa to know this because this is how bad Marissa needs to come back to the show.
7101668	7105231	Okay, you know how Google has the predictive search feature, right?
7105251	7106573	Okay, I want to show you something.
7106653	7110056	Go to Google and type Orange Lounge
7111397	7111877	Radio.
7113138	7115800	And oh, yeah, of course, the one time I do it here.
7115860	7116401	Oh, you know why?
7116421	7118582	Because I'm not doing global research.
7119363	7120904	But I swear to God, I did this the other day.
7121024	7122785	I typed in Orange Lounge Radio.
7123405	7127848	And in the predictive search, the number two thing that came up said Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa.
7129330	7143705	Not Orange Lounge Radio, Chatroom, Orange Lounge Radio, Loki It was Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa Swear to God I was looking at this yesterday and I was laughing my ass off In a good way because I love Marissa But it's just funny that how long ago was it she was on this show?
7147364	7150947	All right, anyhow, let's move on.
7152168	7159314	An appropriate story to follow that last story is about a game design jam called Fuck This Jam.
7160414	7163537	Who is putting this on?
7163597	7164558	It's on a website.
7164678	7166319	It's called fuckthisjam.com.
7166339	7167240	Well, that's appropriate.
7168080	7168761	Oh, okay, here it is.
7168861	7175186	It's organized by Rami Ismail of Vlambeer and independent designer Fernando Romalo.
7175867	7179870	Fuck This Jam apparently was basically an inside joke.
7179930	7184193	It came out of a conversation that they had when they went to an arcade in Austin, Texas.
7184613	7187376	It will take place from November 9th through the 17th.
7187776	7191158	Well, why would you care about this besides the cute name?
7191879	7192680	Well, because...
7193160	7204242	The participants in this little contest or whatever, they will be tasked with creating a game in a genre or style that you would ordinarily have disdain for.
7204843	7208543	So in other words, let's say you're the type of person that's like, you know what, I hate sports games.
7208743	7210064	You know, I don't want to play sports.
7210084	7211244	I never play sports games.
7211684	7214425	Then your job in the jam would be to design a sports game.
7215005	7217045	Or let's say, you know, I hate first-person shooters.
7217085	7218665	You got to design a first-person shooter.
7218745	7219666	I hate retro games.
7220226	7220966	I hate role-playing games.
7221346	7242536	so I actually think this is a really neat idea to encourage people to get out of their comfort zones because this is where some of the best ideas come from and you know it's going to lend itself to crossover potential I bet something out of this ends up on Project Greenlight or something just you wait just you wait good luck to everybody that's participating in that fuck this jam
7244161	7245523	Alright, well let's go to the mailbag.
7245623	7253753	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick our favorites out of the mailbag and read them live on air.
7254634	7259840	DarkSakura is not here to read them tonight, but Alan, being such a good sport, has volunteered to read the emails.
7260161	7261863	It probably helped that there was only one.
7262383	7262564	Yes.
7264316	7269480	Now there's one email, and I really empathize with the person who wrote it.
7269500	7276006	It was kind enough to write it in, because when I write stuff, I'm often very verbose and go on about something I care a lot about.
7276126	7283632	It's a Windows 8 rant email, and this person did say how long it is, and it is long enough that we're not going to read the whole thing on the show.
7283712	7284413	It's not personal.
7286594	7287535	So it is from...
7291322	7291803	13x Forever.
7292603	7296405	And he writes a Windows 8 email and he says, Hello, OLR crew and Bobby.
7296565	7301848	I heard you have an empty mailbox problem, so I finally took my time to write about that Windows 8 hate show two weeks ago.
7302008	7311874	First off, I love that our show is now a relay to Bobby, as well as just like blast us with an email and hope Bobby gets some splash damage from it all.
7312934	7313956	It's an AoE attack.
7314156	7314837	Exactly.
7314897	7316238	Hello, all our crew and Bobby.
7316278	7321765	I heard you have an empty mailbox problem, so I finally took my time to write about that Windows 8 hate show two weeks ago.
7322285	7325489	Yeah, this mail will be long, so maybe you should skip it for the show.
7325549	7325869	Sorry.
7325930	7330515	Also, I have to apologize in advance if I trail off topic or go on Rumble for too long.
7332116	7351103	And then, yeah, first of all, I highly recommend to read Paul Allen's take on Windows 8 with a link, interface changes, and Rafael Rivera's post on the Minecraft certification debacle, and optionally, his own rant, or the person who wrote this in, on Google+, on this topic.
7351843	7359606	And then it goes on, and unfortunately we can't read all of it, but he did include, thank you, Ryder, a TLDR summary.
7361006	7363528	Smart idea when you send in a long email.
7363688	7365669	Include the too-long-didn't-read portion.
7366770	7370312	So TLDR summary, you should really try it for yourself before judging.
7370453	7374115	Sometimes to build something new, you have to break something old, and people will hate you for it.
7374855	7380499	All of the hate on the internet for Windows 8 stems from a few articles published by ignorant writers to get more clicks for their websites.
7381079	7387304	Desktop experience is the same as for Windows 7, only much more polished, plus you have Metro, which is mostly optional.
7388164	7395209	Notch is fighting some illusory threats of software freedom on commercial OS 2 in most unconventional ways.
7395729	7400113	Yes, Windows 8 will sell worse than Windows 7 and everyone will point and laugh.
7400153	7403515	You're probably biased Russian neighbor 13x forever.
7403975	7410060	So I'm wondering maybe if I'm on the VOG article for when the podcast episode goes up, maybe we can include that email.
7411140	7412360	on the forums, on the forums.
7434406	7439569	Just because they've seen some screenshots and they don't like the fact that there's something different.
7439609	7442591	That they're presenting this start menu and it's different.
7442952	7445913	Again, I'm paraphrasing here and this is the message I took from it.
7445933	7448835	It was essentially, change is going to happen.
7449035	7450196	Change is inevitable.
7450456	7452057	Change has to start from somewhere.
7452397	7456580	If you like the start menu, didn't the start menu start somewhere?
7456700	7460783	So why is everybody hating on this when many of them haven't tried it?
7461263	7463404	I hate this, I hate this cause it looks like an Xbox
7482353	7490664	Not Gabe Newell basically said we've messed around with the Windows 8 kit and he was like personally he didn't want to design software for it because he thought it was a big steaming turd.
7491004	7494729	So whenever someone from Valve says something, everyone like...
7495540	7518539	Valve says Windows 8 is garbage and then it just echoes through the whole internet which is not really what they said right yeah that the whole game of telephone happens yeah so interesting now I will say there was also a portion of the email that really addressed the whole Windows certification thing and the fact that I think people are reading too much into it and it's not that Microsoft that was a huge part of what yeah the Valve complaint was too so
7520120	7522662	Just to be clear, it's not that Microsoft wants a cut of it.
7522782	7524903	It's that Microsoft wants to certify it.
7525003	7529425	And I'm assuming it's similar to how they might certify.
7529445	7532147	I know because I've done some of this development at work.
7532647	7542152	It's harder to run macros and even access in Word if you don't certify your content because of the illegitimate stuff that's out there.
7542212	7545533	So imagine expanding that bubble to include software.
7545573	7546814	That's kind of where it's going.
7546854	7552517	Isn't that kind of like the Nintendo's official CLO quality where they had to play every game even if it was bad to make sure it was good enough?
7552897	7558039	They don't do that anymore because, of course, the Wii is the biggest shovelware console in like 10 years.
7558680	7561921	Well, and also people got around the Nintendo CLO quality.
7561981	7571666	Like it worked for a while, but then when it was because Atari or Tengen, as it was, won that lawsuit where they tried to stop that from happening...
7571966	7578910	They were able to keep Tetris off the shelves because that was a particular circumstance, but they were not able to keep those cartridges off shelves.
7579330	7586795	I can't remember if the lawsuit was Tengen specifically or if it was one of the other companies like Color Dreams or one of them back in the day, but Nintendo tried to stop it.
7586895	7588736	They lost, so there was nothing they could do about it.
7588776	7591357	So I think at that point, they kind of gave up.
7591537	7596720	But yeah, Nintendo put those locks into place because they were trying to prevent another video game crash.
7596760	7599302	The other big, big, big thing they did on the NES, remember this?
7599542	7603606	Yeah, because a lot of the games on the 2600 weren't even designed on proper development kits.
7603626	7604207	They were trash.
7604267	7604447	Yeah.
7604787	7607230	Well, publishers could only put out three games a year.
7607530	7610773	If you paid for these development kits or whatever, you could only put out three games a year.
7611254	7616319	So that's why, well, you had these publishers start to put out, just invent subsidiaries to get around it.
7616619	7618100	That's where Ultra Games came from.
7618221	7619742	Ultra Games was just Konami.
7619922	7620503	That's all it was.
7620983	7631433	It was just Konami and it existed solely to put out more Konami games on the NES like Metal Gear and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were Ultra Games.
7632994	7633655	But it was Konami.
7634555	7634996	So anyway...
7636618	7640883	That was a total tangent that that emailer was not expecting at all whatsoever, but there you go.
7641243	7643866	So at the end of the day, let's go back, take a step back.
7644527	7647810	What about the course part of the argument?
7648070	7652215	I think what I took away from it was don't knock it until you've tried it.
7654088	7654809	Allen, is it fair?
7655129	7655529	That's fair.
7655609	7657550	You haven't tried it, so should you be knocking it?
7658771	7667177	Windows, well, I made a joke once that Windows OSs are like the Star Trek movies, the original ones, that every other one is a piece of shit and the other, every other one is really good.
7668017	7672640	Because XP Professional, I ran for years because it was rock solid.
7673120	7681386	When Vista came out, they tried to drag gamers over to Vista by saying if you want DirectX 10, you have to use Vista.
7682286	7685627	I'm like, DirectX fine is 9 for me, I'll stay on XP.
7686067	7689048	And now 7 is so fucking good, I can't imagine why I'd want to leave 7.
7690048	7690448	7's great.
7692589	7696750	And the bummer is, it's not like you can just try 8 out and then go back or 10.
7696950	7699951	I don't think you can.
7700051	7701871	No, I don't think you can down rev windows.
7702451	7705032	So, it's either all in or out.
7705972	7708273	Alright, well thank you very much for the email, even if it was a little long.
7709875	7712356	Hopefully we covered the points to your satisfaction.
7712396	7715917	And we, you know, either way, we still appreciate the other perspective.
7716297	7718458	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
7718718	7720119	We get to disagree sometimes.
7721059	7722920	All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.
7739919	7741720	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with your FU?
7742320	7749783	An FU to eMachineshop for their fur I'm not working nicely with Google SketchUp, unfortunately.
7750263	7760488	The wonderful painstaking process of creating the part of the beatgear pad or whatever, it came out nice, so they can't import it at all.
7761168	7766110	And I tried recreating it in their stupid pad editor, and it sucks.
7767530	7768311	So, fuck that.
7770662	7781424	Um, you know, despite all the stress I went through in the past week, I had a pretty good weekend, so I can't complain too much, although I will say F you to my voice, and F you to the fact that I'm getting old.
7782044	7788706	That part kind of sucks, and yeah, I didn't just do Rocky on Friday.
7789266	7794407	I actually helped out with another performance piece that some of the gals on cast asked me to do.
7795247	7799048	Just play a really quick walk-on roll-in, and I did it, so I had to do that last night.
7799508	7800828	That is part of that performance.
7800888	7803869	I'm supposed to die on stage, which means I have to take a stage fall.
7804469	7807449	Yeah, totally bruised my knee doing that yesterday.
7807749	7808610	So that part sucked.
7809490	7815111	So FU to getting old, where my bones are old and frail and I can't take falls like I used to be able to.
7816011	7816471	Wah.
7817251	7818131	Alan, your FU's of the week.
7819411	7820772	Things are going pretty well for me.
7820832	7823752	I got a second day off this week, which I wasn't expecting.
7824092	7825793	So the apartment's all clean.
7827533	7828033	I hate...
7829761	7830801	There it is, the FUs of the week.
7830821	7833042	Two more stories and then Twitter topics and the Skype line.
7833062	7833282	So, Loki.
7850382	7857766	All right, so there's going to be some price discounts pretty soon for the Xbox 360 coming in the form of their holiday bundles.
7857806	7860948	They're actually going to have two bundles out that are actually pretty cool.
7861508	7866631	There's one that's going to be the Kinect 4GB bundle, and they have a 250GB just regular bundle.
7873155	7899864	for $250 you can get a holiday bundle which is the 250GB Kinect and those are usually $350 and I guess the bundles have different games packed in they've got DLC codes for everything from Forza 4 Kinect Disneyland Adventures Fable 3 Halo Reach and also they're going to have I guess codes for a digital copy of Skyrim I actually saw that in one of them um
7901204	7901885	Let's see here.
7902205	7913875	I can get a 4GB console for $250 or just a regular system without a Kinect bundle in there for $250.
7913935	7917898	That comes with Forza and Skyrim as a digital copy.
7918018	7928366	Also, they have a 4GB Kinect bundle that's going to have Kinect Adventures and Kinect Disneyland Adventures.
7929735	7930577	Well, that's kind of stupid.
7930597	7932823	Why would you buy the old one?
7935552	7961426	I don't know for whatever reason I guess I'm marking down the old bundles in case you know because it doesn't seem very smart to have the old bundle with less stuff in it for the same for you know more than what it is with more stuff in it but apparently they still have the same pricing you can get the holiday bundle without connect Disneyland adventures I guess if you really hate Disney and you just you know fuck it I'm not getting anything extra you do that
7961946	7978103	so those are three bundles that are available I guess now so you can check that out and then some older holiday bundles too they've got one with Halo, Reach, and Fable 3 that was the old one but I guess that's not available anymore cool
7979389	7981831	No surprise there, price drops in time for the holidays.
7982171	7985274	And for Wii U. Maybe that it's, yeah, true, competition there.
7985314	7988897	And maybe to, you know, just encourage a few more copies to move after Thanksgiving.
7988937	7997765	Honestly though, I mean, if you don't give a shit about Kinect, which honestly nowadays you probably shouldn't give a shit about Kinect, at least this console generation.
7998605	8001227	The one with Forza 4 and Skyrim is a pretty good deal.
8001848	8002909	Those are pretty awesome games.
8004758	8005158	Good tip?
8005679	8006299	Yeah.
8006319	8009422	Alright, one more story for you guys, and this is about what could have been.
8010683	8014866	Blizzard had once planned a version of Diablo for the Game Boy Color.
8014946	8016447	Can you even imagine that?
8017568	8017828	Ew!
8018069	8018429	Right?
8019570	8022172	Like StarCraft on the N64, you remember that?
8022612	8022872	Diablo Jr.
8045151	8053472	each packing a different hero in the warrior rogue sorcerer vein as well as items that players would have to trade for in order to collect
8055819	8058181	Development was only with a handful of staff.
8058561	8062044	They started working on Diablo Junior after the release of Diablo 2.
8062984	8069229	It could have been the Game Boy Color or the Game Boy Advance or both, I guess just due to the timing of all of this.
8070930	8077395	Diablo Junior was ultimately put out to pasture because of the steep production costs associated with developing handheld games.
8079057	8083820	I guess there is a book coming out or a project called Stay Awhile and Listen.
8083860	8089905	It's an unauthorized history of Blizzard based on the testimony of 80 ex-employees.
8090706	8091767	This gonna be good.
8093382	8095683	Wow, I didn't know somebody was working on something like that.
8095723	8097284	That sounds like it's going to be amazing.
8098064	8102346	Apparently, there was also another Diablo 2 expansion that never saw the light of day.
8103046	8110850	It was going to have guild halls for multiplayer clan meetings and two other character classes that also came out of that.
8110970	8111290	StarCraftGhost
8133486	8133727	Ooh.
8134868	8137690	I like this, the unauthorized look.
8137790	8140592	Or they're really awesome franchises from the 90s they haven't touched.
8141593	8145416	Like Lost Vikings, or Blackthorn, or Rock and Roll Racing.
8147258	8149340	Didn't they also do the Shake, Rattle, and Roll?
8149360	8150020	Was that Blizzard?
8150040	8150701	I don't know.
8151782	8152743	They got more franchises.
8152763	8154204	Sorry, Shake, Rattle, and Roll.
8154624	8155205	Who did that?
8157226	8160529	There is more out there than WoW and Diablo.
8161210	8161530	Blizzard.
8163340	8164721	Or they could come up with something new.
8164821	8167704	I know that's a hard to believe concept.
8167764	8168825	Whatever Titan is.
8169365	8171307	Whatever Titan is supposed to be a completely unique IP.
8171487	8172148	Oh, I'm an idiot.
8172208	8174190	Snake Rattle and Roll was just straight up rare.
8175511	8177212	Why did I think that was Blizzard?
8177953	8180395	Am I really that dumb?
8180595	8181376	I guess so.
8184241	8185201	Whatever, shut up.
8185642	8193804	All right, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8193864	8196565	The Skype line is open right now.
8198026	8201347	And while we're waiting for some calls to come in, we will do some tweets.
8202347	8204368	TigerClaw sending a few tweets tonight.
8204708	8210091	See in here I thought it was a slow news week and yet we've got more stories coming in thanks to Twitter so I appreciate that.
8210511	8215794	TigerClaw on Twitter with a story EA apparently accidentally gave away thousands of free games.
8216215	8216635	Yeah.
8217075	8218436	How the hell did this happen?
8219380	8224965	They had a code that was, I think it was for reviewers or something like that, for Origin, where it gave people $20 off.
8225065	8233452	Yeah, it said it was a thanks for completing a survey, and it allowed them to download a free game from Origin, but the code could be used by anybody.
8233872	8235253	It was an unlimited use code.
8236534	8237175	That's the problem.
8237195	8238195	I'm reading it here on the story.
8238356	8239757	The code was not secured.
8239857	8241018	Someone made EA lose money.
8241058	8243420	They're going to have to commit seppuku in a conference room.
8243560	8244280	Oh, my gosh.
8244340	8244541	All right.
8245381	8247023	Apparently, it ended up on Reddit.
8247043	8247283	Yeah.
8249184	8249945	Mass Effect Mass Effect
8266980	8282545	Okay, anyway, before the new multiplayer stuff came out and the Omega DLC stuff got announced, Mike, I think it's Gamble, posted something about how the upcoming DLC is kind of like the shape of things to come.
8283485	8287547	And I'm wondering if this DLC is kind of...
8288544	8295746	I don't know, pointing at a more massive multiplayer Mass Effect game.
8295886	8297447	Oh, here we go.
8298107	8300288	Here we go, Mass Effect MMO.
8300408	8303009	Hold on, I'm justifying it, okay?
8303109	8303529	Alright.
8304574	8332949	with the Volus class apparently it's pretty much just a support class you can still kill things and be really awesome but it's primarily for support so if you've got a support class your vanguards can take hits really well and everybody else can do shooty things why not something in the vein of a PSO style game where you have centralized hubs you can still do massive story missions but
8333945	8337210	It's just all the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3.
8341137	8341477	Okay.
8342199	8344342	So... Okay, sorry.
8344402	8345203	Run this by me again.
8345264	8348288	How is this going to impact the single-player side of it, though, with the expansion?
8349534	8350374	Yeah, I made a comment.
8375011	8379333	And who knows if the Elcor and the Hanar don't show up sometime down the line.
8379393	8380634	I could see something happen.
8402381	8416725	Also, Avolis, I have one if you want to, we can do a match together after the show if you want to see how they play, would be terrible support for a Vanguard because I couldn't stay close enough to you.
8416765	8420026	They can't hop over cover, so they have to actually run around the map.
8420446	8423907	That's kind of adorable in a really weird way.
8423927	8429949	So yeah, if a Vanguard biotic charges and fucks off, I'm going to have to run to your ass to refresh your shields and that's not going to work.
8430410	8432291	And that's all I do as my Vanguard.
8432331	8433271	I just fly around.
8433751	8436312	But you with my Sentinel worked out all right, actually.
8436372	8436892	Yeah, we did.
8437052	8438692	We duoed, what, wave four, wave five?
8438812	8441433	Yeah, now my Sentinel was only level four, so that was pretty good.
8441593	8442854	Yeah, it was collectors too, right?
8443294	8443974	Yeah, it was.
8444934	8445834	Which are super fun.
8445875	8448735	They're bastards is what they are.
8448775	8454377	Commander Shepard just joined our chat room and said, Hi, I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite Mass Effect podcast on the Citadel.
8456053	8456553	If only.
8457294	8457794	You jerk.
8457934	8458254	All right.
8458935	8459955	It'll happen eventually.
8460015	8473423	Is there anything non... Well, actually, let me ask you this question because whenever people bring up Mass Effect podcast in chat, Black Wolf likes to chime in and say there's not enough content out there to substantiate a weekly podcast.
8473543	8474704	That's a lie now, though.
8475144	8476004	It's totally a lie.
8476165	8476445	Okay.
8476485	8478226	That's a cop-out answer because...
8479059	8502238	every like okay there is fan fiction there's fan works like art music there are books that have been out comics that have been out multiplayer updates that come out always speculation going on for the next games you it's there's enough content there for weekly episodes for sure well then you need to produce a pilot sir and prove everybody wrong
8504403	8508350	But how am I supposed to do that and play Pokemon in Mass Effect and WoW?
8508690	8508971	All right.
8509071	8511515	And watch Once Upon a Time in Walking Dead.
8512521	8518667	You just gave me an excellent opportunity to transition away from Mass Effect for a minute because you've been playing Pokemon Black 2, White 2.
8519068	8525694	And I know that you are an almost 30-year-old playing Pokemon games.
8526395	8531520	One of the original VOG articles was about your love of Pokemon and how you're a little old for it.
8531960	8535504	So how are the new games and why do you still love this series?
8536587	8550454	I'll never not love this series they're just really fun RPGs and the Pokemon for the most part are adorable and who doesn't want to collect adorable things PETA that game was really fun I played it
8552128	8552629	They're good.
8552949	8554331	They contract good programmers.
8554351	8556073	They really are good.
8557755	8559337	No, there's just... I don't know.
8559637	8560658	It's just fun.
8560718	8568588	In fact, I'm going to see my friends up near Kansas City this weekend, and we're going to have a Pokemon tournament, I was just informed.
8568648	8569869	And I was like, oh, heck yes.
8569949	8572052	And they're my age, too, and they're all excited.
8573661	8579344	Alright, I love this comment from Frisbee in the chat room talking about Shane's Mass Effect podcast, I'm assuming.
8580084	8586988	Frisbee says, there's fan fiction, fan art, fan wank, fan dango, etc.
8589349	8593891	There are Skyrim podcasts that are still going just because of all the mods that you can talk about.
8594171	8595332	Alright, alright, alright.
8596072	8598474	BlackWolf says, five weeks in a row.
8599414	8600254	Five weeks in a row.
8600294	8603076	You gotta have a show that's got five episodes and then...
8603416	8607420	What if I make five episodes in one night and then spread them out over five weeks?
8608141	8608982	Some people do that.
8610083	8612585	You don't say that's what you're doing in advance, dummy.
8612866	8614547	That was hypothetical.
8614587	8616009	Why would I cheat like that?
8619150	8620511	As I write this down.
8622812	8624113	What else was I going to ask you?
8624173	8627015	Oh yes, with Pokemon, I know you're playing a lot of WoW.
8627055	8628596	How's pet battles going for you?
8629536	8633119	I have stopped pet battling because I'm trying to level things and get gear.
8633619	8637461	But it's like a terrible addiction.
8637701	8640223	And I'm trying to cut myself off cold turkey at the moment.
8640263	8641984	And I still think about it every so often.
8642004	8645927	And when somebody posts that they got a new pet, I'm like, I wonder how that would be in battle.
8646772	8649173	But I'm just not doing anything with it.
8651633	8656815	Before we let you go for the night, is there any message you want to give to horde tanks out there that might be listening?
8657555	8659155	That's what I was going to say anyway.
8659635	8660556	Glad you brought that up.
8661536	8671999	So if you're a horde tank, preferably a paladin or a warrior, and you would like a fun, laid-back raid group that wants to do content while it's current,
8672839	8684960	please please please server transfer to Proudmoore and get a hold of somebody in the guild Malevolence and we'll find you a home and we won't make fun of you much I promise
8686690	8689411	Alright, that's it.
8690572	8691672	Anything else before I let you go?
8694153	8695273	Probably not.
8695653	8702616	Oh, except I was very sad because, Alan, you talked about a Kaden and Shepard fanfic I hadn't read yet and I don't know where to find it.
8704091	8707854	I think I can dig it up.
8708015	8711037	No, I don't have any fix saved to a folder on my hard drive.
8711077	8712518	I just know what time my user wrote it.
8714080	8723308	I don't have any fix, but I definitely have fun, awesome pictures I found that aren't porn, so I have to make that distinction before it gets a lot out of hand.
8723408	8726471	As long as no genitalia is showing, it's not porn.
8727151	8727933	Oh, there isn't, no.
8728474	8729637	There's none whatsoever.
8729858	8731642	I think that would be weird anyway to have.
8732384	8734849	Alright, I'm ending this conversation before it gets awkward.
8734930	8735391	Bye.
8735411	8736633	I'll keep it awkward.
8736694	8736954	Bye.
8739072	8742754	1-877-GAME-OLR Use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
8743694	8745115	I think there was another Twitter topic.
8745636	8747897	Do you have any last-minute stories, Loki, while I bring this one up?
8748277	8748998	No.
8749398	8752920	I had the EA one, but somebody took it.
8752960	8753701	Somebody took it.
8753741	8755782	Well, we got another call coming in, so hooray for that.
8755862	8756863	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8756883	8757243	Who's this?
8757743	8758664	Hey, hey, it's Ranma.
8758704	8759184	Hey, Ranma.
8759204	8759664	How you doing?
8761465	8762786	Ow, my feet.
8763246	8765548	Ooh, you're calling in to talk about New York Comic Con, I bet.
8766263	8773487	More or less, I was actually calling in to kind of agree with the whole pirating thing, because even in my fandom, we have to deal with it.
8773887	8779350	We call the people that bootleg the anime and stuff, we call them spoiled entitlement bitches.
8780090	8784092	Ooh, and just because they're spoiled and entitled?
8784836	8797582	They feel that because it comes out in Japan, they can download the fan subs and watch all the episodes and decide not to buy it when it comes released here because they feel that, I already have it, why should I go out and buy it?
8800019	8809183	I can feel that because I was about to say when you started your thought, I was like, oh, because I was kind of like that for a while because like I and I've admitted to this in the show in the past.
8809343	8815745	I have downloaded games that were released in Japan only because I feel if the game companies aren't going to bother.
8815845	8819787	I've also done it with games that were only put out in Europe before they were announced for the America.
8820367	8821308	I'm guilty of doing that too
8847725	8852649	And when they release the American versions of DDR, I buy every single one of them.
8853050	8855131	So did I. So, you know, to be fair.
8855572	8867282	So it's a little different than your scenario because you're saying they watch it and then when they release it in America, the Americanized version, or I mean, I guess not really the Americanized version, but the, you know, whatever they end up putting out here, they fuck off.
8868202	8897195	but also on the same token they do it because they can and let's say the series just comes out in the US and the DVDs are like 40 bucks for an entire box set people will go and buy that 40 dollar box set, rip the episodes and put them online they'll even put the full disc online and people will find them and download them because they can well and that's the same thing with games right some pirates do it because they can
8898065	8918543	and it's like I said if Halo 4 comes out at $19.99 it'll still be pirated because they want to save that $20 and that same person that doesn't want to drop $19.99 on a game will go buy a spindle of blanks to spread to make copies to give to their friends what's this comment you just made in chat Alan that's somewhat on topic with all this
8919844	8926990	Oh, I was just saying, back in the late 90s, early 2000s, I used to order fan subs from anime all the time.
8927390	8929011	I don't know if that's what he's talking about.
8929392	8931033	Specifically Sailor Moon.
8931874	8938799	Yeah, partially, and it's become where the companies will contact the fan servers and ask them not to continue with this.
8939180	8941361	A lot of them will be like, sure, no problem.
8941641	8947066	Some of them are like, you know what, fuck you, we're going to continue to fan sub it because we do a better job than you can.
8947489	8957440	Yeah, well, a lot of times when a fan subber got a cease and desist, that was great news for the community because the only reason why the company was doing that is because we bought the rights to this show.
8957540	8961544	It's coming out next year and then the community would be happy because, yay, they were finally getting it.
8962062	8966906	Yeah, um, Alan, to also go with that, same thing happened when Fullmetal Alchemist came out.
8967266	8976634	Since Square Enix pretty much helped put it out in Japan, when Funimation picked it up, Square Enix told them, you gotta translate this pretty much word for word.
8976694	8978896	You can't mishap anything here or there.
8979216	8983539	They're working on it, sending out the CNDs to all the fansubbers, telling them, oh, they can't do this.
8983780	8984720	They're like, sure, why?
8985620	9014592	or Leo will step back some of those fansubbers will go behind their backs and continue fansubbing the series under a different title and a CND goes to them and so on and so forth and so forth well Ranma I don't want to burn all the time talking about Piracy well no it's fine it's a good conversation but I want to hear about a New York Comic Con because I hear Travis was there too and Critical Myth I think was there too I didn't see Critical Myth but I did run into the one and only Travis Donovan
9014963	9015403	Did you?
9015744	9016844	Was that the first time you met him?
9017285	9017485	Yes.
9017745	9021668	He freaked the fuck out when I walked up to him with my big old afro.
9024770	9025251	Amazing.
9026511	9028993	So what did you do and see in New York Comic Con?
9029033	9029694	What was there to do?
9030796	9032237	I mostly went for the cosplays.
9032377	9034157	The exhibition hall was ginormous.
9035018	9049823	There was a few indie games there, but big games that were there was the Capcom booth showing off Darkstalkers Resurrection, and then there was the Halo 4 booth, and then further down there was Square Enix's new Tomb Raider game.
9050994	9052534	Oh, wow, I didn't realize they were going to be there.
9052574	9052994	That's cool.
9053615	9063196	And unfortunately, I wasn't able to check out any of these games because Comic-Con decided to give just me press and the rest of my staffers no press access at all.
9063436	9063776	Dope.
9064457	9067457	Yeah, and the lines were like three and four hours long.
9067857	9072658	I couldn't even get up in there time to try out the Wii U. Oh, that sucks.
9073178	9073738	Sorry to hear it.
9074758	9075239	It is what it is.
9075279	9077339	I'll just try to get over to Nintendo World later this week.
9078228	9086324	well since I know you're all about the cosplay which I know the listeners can hear more about on Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights on VOG what was some of the good cosplay you saw?
9088204	9092566	Um, believe it or not, I've seen some pretty good My Little Pony cosplays.
9092966	9093526	Oh, God.
9093987	9094927	Of course.
9094947	9100449	Comic-Con is just comics, manga, pop culture, everything all together.
9100470	9101930	That's what it's come down to.
9102330	9109233	I mean, I did see a couple of good Master Chief cosplays running around, but one of the most popular one was Scott Pilgrim.
9110094	9110534	Oh, nice.
9114082	9120226	BlackWolfInChat says Ranma's met two VOG people for the first time in the span of a month because you met Bobby last month, huh?
9120666	9132013	Yeah, when I finally got to the hotel and rested up he shows up in his awesome car and we head on over to Waffle House and chilled As long as I'm still your favorite Oh, you know that
9135347	9138289	Oh, and then Travis is going to make you take that back on his show later on.
9139350	9140951	Is that always the case, you know?
9141791	9143012	PAX East is coming up.
9143272	9147715	You know, one thing we didn't bring up on tonight's show, I just realized, but we should probably address.
9148016	9148716	Well, here's the thing.
9148756	9149557	We could talk about it.
9149877	9153960	PAX East badges went on sale, and then we can mention, oh, but they're already gone.
9155785	9156846	Get me started on that.
9157386	9160407	I am so pissed and aggravated about that whole situation.
9160727	9161328	Why?
9161708	9162488	Didn't you get a ticket?
9163308	9164789	Yeah, my brother got me a ticket.
9165049	9167690	And when I got home, I got Jovi's ticket.
9167710	9169571	I got her a Friday, Saturday, Sunday badge.
9169771	9170792	That was the only way.
9171312	9176935	But the people behind PAX let people buy as many badges as they want.
9177375	9179336	And then they went directly to eBay.
9179476	9181917	That's why the three-day ticket sold out in 24 hours.
9182017	9182517	Oh, lame.
9183157	9183898	That's pretty bad.
9185005	9189148	If you want to go, I'm telling you, you better get a Friday, Saturday, Sunday because I don't know about you.
9190408	9194511	I don't think you want to go on eBay and try to drop three bills on a three-day badge.
9194611	9196852	Yeah, that's not good.
9198313	9200894	It really couldn't have happened on a worse week for me.
9201054	9201975	I didn't buy a badge.
9202135	9207698	I am crossing my fingers and toes that our existence can justify at least one media pass.
9208138	9208878	Exactly.
9208998	9216721	I will be more than happy to interview developers and have VOG articles and coverage on the shows and YouTubes and all that stuff.
9217761	9220342	Just hopefully that'll work out because otherwise I ain't going.
9221603	9226264	But this was just like after I spent a disgusting amount of money on Rocky Horror.
9226304	9229326	Just ask Alan, although it might be a little bit of a stressful point.
9229646	9231606	But I spent a lot of money on that shit.
9231686	9233187	So I didn't have money for badges.
9233755	9234636	Rob, I understand.
9234696	9236359	Rocky Horror, that's your fandom.
9236379	9237060	That's your baby.
9237080	9238101	That's your pride and joy.
9239002	9243668	I can't say anything about that because if it was something of a hobby of mine like that, I would have done the same thing.
9243889	9244409	That's right.
9244870	9246873	I've spent a lot of money on VOG too.
9247894	9249937	And these podcasts have a lot of
9250217	9250777	That is so weird.
9250817	9250937	I know.
9277043	9279443	So weird, but all right, it is what it is.
9279543	9280244	It ain't my con.
9280664	9281444	It's a good con.
9281504	9284044	When the con gets here, everybody that gets to go will have a good time.
9284444	9287525	BlizzCon ain't any better with the way they do it.
9288565	9295927	Look, the most important part is the fact that I secured two rooms for everybody so we have a place to stay.
9295947	9300367	That was the most important thing, and we got hotel space from Thursday to Sunday.
9300847	9301568	Well, you're the bomb.
9301608	9303828	If I'm able to get a media badge, I'm going to be like, right.
9306129	9310956	And in that case, when you come down, me and Jovi will head on over to the airport and pick you up.
9311577	9313119	Oh, you're the bestest.
9314060	9314501	We try.
9314741	9316964	Alright, I should let you go so we can go wrap the show.
9317385	9318206	Alright, take care, bro.
9318286	9318847	Thanks, bye.
9321303	9322364	See, Ranma's got my back.
9323145	9323985	Because I'm his favorite.
9324145	9325106	We already established this.
9325927	9326647	Take that, Bobby.
9326787	9327248	Just kidding.
9327808	9329009	Bobby's going to be at PAX, too.
9329069	9331151	I know he's going, so who knows?
9331591	9339157	Then that's kind of cool, because since PAX Prime is the same weekend as DragonCon, at least we get to have a little bit of PAX in our lives.
9339337	9342320	I mean, I shouldn't say that PAX East is less than PAX Prime.
9342841	9352977	I like the timing of PAX Prime with the exception of the fact that it's the same weekend as DragonCon I like the timing of PAX Prime a little more than PAX East but I know we'll have a good time at PAX East
9354105	9376364	If I get to go Anyhow, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight Because those were some long calls But thank you guys so much To those that called in If for whatever reason you weren't able to get through tonight Do send us an email Because we're always short on emails Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com One more Twitter topic here I want to read about And it has to do with Wing Commander So it's worth mentioning
9376984	9378605	Weren't you a fan of Wing Commander back in the day, Alan?
9378766	9378906	Yes.
9378926	9379366	I know I was.
9379866	9380467	Well, get this.
9380747	9383489	And this is another tweet from Tigerclaw.
9383689	9389173	Wing Commander and Privateer creator Chris Roberts announced a new game called Star Citizen.
9389213	9390233	Didn't we talk about this earlier?
9390393	9390694	Did we?
9390954	9391134	Yes.
9394474	9395635	I forgot about it if we did.
9395695	9395995	It was in chat.
9396015	9396996	I don't think we talked about it on the show.
9397016	9399238	I think it was on Bobby's show at the end.
9399538	9400639	But it wasn't on our show.
9400919	9401120	Yeah.
9401680	9402060	Anyhow.
9402721	9404022	Oh well, then I'm saying it twice.
9404082	9404763	It's Wing Commander.
9404823	9405103	Deal.
9407685	9410147	Star Citizen from Chris Roberts is happening.
9411007	9411828	It's a Kickstarter.
9412148	9413268	It's a crowdfunded game.
9413628	9420491	But, you know, it's already raised $455,000 with the crowdfunding.
9420531	9421571	That's crazy.
9422832	9425413	So it's probably going to make at least a million.
9425493	9429194	So you can look for the return of Wing Commander, even though it's not called Wing Commander.
9429494	9430995	But it's from the same guy.
9431055	9433096	And obviously it has a spaceship-based name.
9433156	9435597	So it's going to be the next evolution.
9436377	9436978	of that series.
9437038	9438539	Hopefully it will turn out better than the movie.
9438659	9444043	You know, I almost backed that Obsidian one and then I realized that the game's not coming out until 2014, so I was like, fuck that.
9446145	9447146	That is a long way away.
9447406	9448467	Not gonna wait.
9450208	9452270	Alright, that wraps up.
9452310	9455432	If you have no other stories for us, Alan, I don't know if you have anything.
9455533	9457894	I don't have any links or anything, but I have something quick.
9458115	9458295	Sure.
9459676	9464200	For those who are in my age group who remember a show called Syphil and Ollie on MTV.
9464900	9465200	Yes!
9466101	9473306	Yeah, they're back, and they're on the Machinima channel reviewing fake video games, and it's like they never left.
9473606	9482552	I don't, because I think this happened a couple weeks ago when the first one showed up, and I don't remember if we brought it up on the show or what, but yes, it is hilarious.
9482632	9487595	Because in the mid and late 90s, MTV did stop showing a lot of music videos.
9488576	9488876	Siflinali
9511013	9512214	and yeah, they're back.
9512995	9523706	Liam, the guy who invented them and wrote them and does the voices was on the Nerdist podcast and he was talking, Chris Hardwick was like, I wish the Nerdist channel had snagged him up.
9524106	9526008	But yeah, he's on, Sifl and Ollie are on Machinima.
9527109	9527349	Nice.
9527930	9528631	They're good for lulls.
9529124	9532188	Let's see, episode one has 92,000 views.
9532248	9532689	Not too bad.
9533369	9533790	Not too bad.
9534911	9535232	All right.
9535552	9536173	Well, thank you very much.
9536814	9539057	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9539117	9545465	Thank you guys who tuned in and support Orange Lounge Radio tonight, whether it be through the podcast or on Stitcher or wherever.
9546326	9552111	And if you're tuning in live, a big thank you for sticking through all the upsies and downsies of the stream.
9552131	9553592	It looks like we've been okay for the past hour.
9553832	9558797	People stopped complaining in part B, so I guess it was just for 30 minutes there or so where it was a little rough.
9558817	9560178	But thank you guys for sticking with it.
9560218	9562180	We really appreciate you guys, your troopers.
9563000	9583106	if you like what you hear here at Orange Launch Radio remember we don't ask for your money to do this shit all we ask is help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio tell a friend or two or leave us a nice review on something like iTunes or a recommendation on Stitcher or TuneIn or any other site wherever you heard of this show there are plenty of other people looking for something like this so word of mouth is great
9585047	9586648	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9586888	9590610	Alan, as always, thank you for pinch-hitting his host tonight, especially on such short notice.
9590790	9591490	Really appreciate it.
9591831	9598034	Glad we could have you on, even if you do live here and you usually get picked on anyway, but you're always great to have on.
9598454	9599815	Do you have a final thought for listeners tonight?
9600155	9600235	No.
9601796	9602056	Bye!
9602676	9603196	I'm tired.
9603396	9603877	I'm on a nap.
9604037	9605177	You can't nap at 9 o'clock.
9605217	9606077	That's called going to bed.
9606237	9608478	That's called going to bed and then you're like a senior citizen.
9609118	9611578	You want to go to IHOP and get a senior citizen special?
9611759	9612959	One piece of bacon and a pancake?
9613059	9620801	I guess an under sedation person after Rocky on Friday was asking Jessica where the big after party was.
9620881	9623221	Like Denny's, you know, we're going to get coffee and chicken strips.
9623361	9624562	And it's like remember when we were all 23?
9624642	9624742	Yeah.
9626308	9627068	That's not happening.
9627208	9630130	Actually, actually, you know what's funny?
9630330	9635773	I got invited to go to Mel's by one of the cast members and I was like, I'm sorry, I gotta go home.
9636433	9637854	Because everyone else on cast is like 20.
9637894	9640495	Our whole lives are ahead of us.
9640515	9642416	Let's stay until four.
9642696	9643417	Oh, you kids.
9644997	9645358	All right.
9646598	9646958	Let's see.
9647058	9648319	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9649380	9651241	I don't know.
9651341	9653422	Hopefully play some Borderlands 2 this week.
9655530	9670346	my final thought is hopefully I'll play something besides WoW and Mass Effect this week not that those are bad games but also my other final thought is it is nice to finally be honored with the Golden Lotus damn you dailies damn you dailies alright
