0	3000	George, Lounge, Radio
7000	13000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	26000	Tonight, October 14th, 2012, an upcoming holiday game is leaked a month early, Valve is looking for some hardware testers, and could you soon feel temperature in your PlayStation controller?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 477 for October the 14th of 2012.
45000	54000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at vognetwork.com to talk about video games and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts.
55000	63000	Sadly not with us tonight, yet again, DarkSakura, not here in studio, which I know a lot of you in the chat room might be going, wait a minute, she's right here.
64000	69000	Well that's the magic of the internet you see. She's sick today. She caught Disneyland plague or something. She caught the gay.
69000	76000	She went to gay days at Disneyland and wouldn't you know it, she walked away with a horrific case of the gay.
77000	82000	And so she will not be here tonight, but she is in chat if you wish to say hello and feel better and so forth.
83000	89000	Anyhow, with us tonight in studio we do have Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? I'm alright. I have a cold.
90000	96000	You have a cold, but it's not the gay. It's not the gay. Alright. The gay doesn't make you all stuffed up, I don't think.
96000	106000	I know, I definitely have the gay because I'm sounding a little sick today, but I just blew out my voice over on Friday, but I'll talk about that later.
107000	114000	Anyhow, also say hello too. We have a guest host here. We love it when he's available and on standby. Say hello to Alan.
115000	119000	It's me again. How are you again? I'm good. What's new with you since the last time we talked to you?
119000	127000	Not much. Working, working a lot. I wanted to pinch hit last week, but I had to work. My amazing boss got me the day off.
128000	139000	You gotta make the money. There you go. And so actually it looks like your horrible terrible boss is in chat right now if you want to say a few words. Not kidding.
140000	142000	I'm giving him a hard time on purpose.
142000	155000	Alright, um, let's see. What else do I need to plug here at the top of the show? Oh yes, be sure you listen to us live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
156000	168000	Or VOG Network dot com. Home to a variety of great geek shows. Not just video game shows. I think that's important to point out is that we do have some awesome video game shows obviously with this one and Bobby and Girls Gone Wow and Hardhouse.
168000	177000	We also have some non-video game shows. Things like Understation Live, Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Out of My Jam Session, etc, etc. Lots of good stuff.
178000	189000	So it all goes down at vognetwork.com. I was going to come with a kickoff topic tonight, but I neglected to think of something because I'm a little bit, my voice is shot tonight.
189000	198000	Because, and I think a lot of other shows on the network have been talking about this, Understation Live, and I just mentioned this on Bobby's show before, and I think I mentioned it on here too.
199000	211000	I was asked, I was fortunate enough to be asked to be the director of the Return of the Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento, and while it went marvelous on Friday, it was very exhausting.
211000	218000	I also emceed the show. So I'm basically screaming obscenities into a mic in front of a crowd of 400 people, and it felt really good.
219000	220000	It's not like what I do.
221000	226000	Kind of. Kind of. On this show every week. Except I could see them. I couldn't hide from them.
227000	228000	I could see them too.
229000	241000	I knew you were going to lose your voice, so get damn close to it, because when you were shouting your intro, there was a part where you literally, like, you blew your voice out. Like, we could hear. That sound wasn't like...
242000	246000	Yeah, no, and I think I even cracked a joke, like, oh, I didn't mean to go into puberty on stage or something like that.
247000	249000	Yeah, it was like, he's not going to enjoy that the next morning.
249000	260000	It was bad. It was bad, but we're okay. Well, I have a crazy idea for a topic, okay? Here's a kickoff topic, my crazy last minute topic tonight.
261000	269000	So we know that this is the season for video games to become movies, because I don't know what it is, but every October, well, I do know what it is.
269000	281000	It's the fact that October is kind of the month for Hollywood to release their crap films, which usually includes the video game movies. Like, you know, all the Resident Evil movies come out late September, October.
282000	292000	We're getting Silent Hill, and I'm not saying these movies are crap, but Hollywood kind of views them as crap, because they're kind of in between this summer blockbuster and Oscar nominee.
293000	294000	Oscar season starts at Thanksgiving.
295000	297000	Exactly, so most video game movies end up coming out in the October season.
297000	313000	Well, I think, you know, if they were actually supposed to be crap, they'd be coming out in January. I think that it's just a good time. I mean, the two movies that came out video game-wise this year are both kind of monster Halloween-y movies, sort of. I mean, Resident Evil's more of an action movie, but...
314000	318000	But there's the Transylvania Hotel or whatever, and the Frankenweenie and all that stuff's coming out.
319000	333000	Wreck-It Ralph very soon, actually. Although, technically, it's a November movie, and I think they're just... Wreck-It Ralph, I mean, here's the thing about Wreck-It Ralph. I know we're all excited about Wreck-It Ralph, right? Because it's Disney and it's video games.
334000	341000	So, obviously, there's a great cross-section here that this show represents very well that is very excited for Wreck-It Ralph.
342000	353000	But I think for... I'm not sure how it's gonna do in the mainstream. I think it is still kind of a risky thing for Disney, so I think that's why it's not their Thanksgiving movie or their Christmas movie.
354000	362000	But it's kind of that odd little place. It's in a place where it will either flop horribly and disappear. I don't think that'll actually happen.
363000	368000	Or it'll catch on and be able to sustain itself through Thanksgiving, because that's sometimes what a lot of family movies do.
368000	375000	Family movies don't always have the huge opening weekend and then disappear off the map like October movies, like Paranormal Activity and stuff do.
376000	383000	These movies tend to have consistent... They're not number one, but they're number three or something four weeks in a row.
384000	389000	And that's kind of where I think Wreck-It Ralph's gonna end up. At least I hope the movie does well.
389000	391000	I think it's gonna do better than that.
392000	401000	The funny thing is I think it's gonna be a lot of parents who are actually into it because of all the Nintendo references and things they remember taking their kids.
402000	406000	I think it's truly a movie that's geared towards both, and there's a lot of people that are excited about that.
407000	416000	Anyway, I got on a tangent talking about Wreck-It Ralph. What I really wanted to ask about was since we're in this time of year where we talk about video game movies and so forth,
416000	427000	I just finished doing a stage show. So what video game do you think deserves a stage show? What video game deserves an adaptation?
428000	436000	It doesn't have to be a musical, but think Broadway style. What video game do you think should become a full-fledged on or off-Broadway production?
437000	451000	Well, they've already kind of done this as a video, but Buggy Saints Row. Because that video was hilarious. Because it was done Broadway style. And it was hilarious.
451000	461000	So I'd go for that and have a bunch of people doing the artistic dancing and singing and stuff like that and have video of Saints Row being buggy.
462000	472000	Or you can even do Buggy Driver 3 because Driver 3 is probably very, very, very, very buggy. I want new music for that though.
473000	476000	Alan, what would you want to see on Broadway?
477000	478000	Maniac Mansion.
478000	480000	That's probably almost too easy of an answer.
481000	482000	It was a TV show at one point, right?
483000	487000	Yeah. Or my troll answer is Echo the Dolphin.
489000	495000	That wouldn't be a Broadway production so much as it would be like the tank show at SeaWorld.
496000	501000	It'd be like Ice Capades. Someone comes out in a dolphin suit. They're swimming through rain.
502000	506000	Hey, hey, hey. Are you saying that dolphins can't ice skate? Because I want to see that.
507000	514000	Okay, they don't have to ice skate, but they can hop up and slide across the ice and then slip back into the water.
515000	521000	Alright, let me get some answers from our chat room. I'm gonna go with the I can't believe Alan didn't say this answer.
522000	527000	Mass Effect? Hello? Should Mass Effect be a musical? Come on.
528000	530000	You can't do those effects on a stage. That needs a movie.
531000	532000	That would be amazing.
533000	534000	It would not be amazing.
535000	538000	Let's look at some of the answers from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
539000	547000	Wicked says Final Fantasy 6 the opera scene. I think that's a very, you know, well, I mean technically it was an opera.
548000	552000	So it's like now you're talking about the play that became the video game that became the play.
553000	557000	That's like Street Fighter 2 the movie the game type of thing.
558000	565000	Dark Sakura is in our chat tonight saying Clu Clu Land. How would that work? Somebody would just pole dance on stage.
566000	568000	Clu Clu Land would be a showgirls type thing.
569000	573000	Irritating Stick. Katamari Damacy.
574000	576000	Oh wow, that would be a hell of a stage show.
577000	581000	It's like Lion King right there. It's like some crazy, crazy stuff.
582000	587000	Someone like they're going to come out of there and be like, did I just drop acid or something? What happened to that?
588000	591000	Stan in our chat room says Space Channel 5 should be on Broadway.
592000	594000	Now there you go. There is a great musical idea.
595000	598000	That could actually work, which is kind of sad.
599000	599000	
600000	601000	Sad in an awesome way though.
602000	605000	Let's see, SSG100Matt says Parappa the Rappa.
606000	613000	Let's see, Stan says in Chicago they've done a Mario Burlesque show. Same with Zelda I think.
614000	619000	That's just cosplay strippers. I mean come on, that's all that is.
620000	626000	Burlesque show. Okay fine, let's just add some class to that. It's a fucking cosplay person stripping.
627000	630000	Hey now, I have friends that do burlesque that would take a lot of offense to what you're saying right now.
631000	632000	Good, I aim to offend everybody.
633000	634000	You are so rude.
635000	644000	Well, here's the thing. At least you can say this, if the burlesque community has done it, you know what other communities probably done it?
645000	651000	Drag queens. So my question is, has there been a Mario or Zelda drag queen show?
652000	659000	Alan, you used to live in the city and go to these shows. What was the craziest drag queen show you saw in the city?
659000	667000	They were all really amazing actually. One time I went they did Ziggy Stardust album from start to finish.
668000	671000	Smashing Pumpkins, Drag Tribute Night. It was amazing.
672000	675000	See, when I think of drag queens, I don't think of Smashing Pumpkins.
676000	678000	That's why San Francisco is more alternative.
679000	682000	Oh, excuse me. San Francisco's hipster drag apparently.
684000	688000	The whole cabaret, the greatest love of all, you're not going to find that there.
689000	694000	Rama in the chat says, Loki, I know people that do cosplay burlesque, dude.
695000	700000	Burlesque stripping, fine. Are we really just going to like...
701000	712000	Are you telling me that the end of the show that they don't end up with less clothing on, therefore they are stripping off clothing? It's the same thing.
713000	715000	Alright, let me get to a few more answers here in chat.
715000	723000	Frisbee says they've already done a Phoenix Wright musical in Japan. There's that movie coming that I keep forgetting is like a thing.
724000	727000	So I hope I get to see that soon.
728000	736000	Let's see if there's any other... Jessica Harper from Understation Live says, Crazy Taxi. It's one hell of a taxi ride.
737000	739000	Can I have a Crazy Taxi musical? There you go.
740000	741000	I want to change my answer.
742000	743000	Okay, what do you want to say?
743000	744000	Out of This World?
745000	746000	You know that French game?
747000	751000	Yeah, I think Jamie did that as a classic game once, yeah. Good answer.
752000	759000	Awesome. And DJ Morpheus in chat says, I saw a peach drag queen at New York Comic Con.
760000	765000	Actually, I got to say the peach drag queen thing has been done at several conventions. I've seen that.
765000	774000	So, there you go. Thanks to the wonders of the internet. Whenever a dude dresses up as peach, it's always on the internet the next day.
775000	776000	Alright, there you go.
777000	783000	So in our kickoff topic, we managed to talk about burlex shows, drag queens, musicals, and offend people.
784000	785000	There you go. I'd say kickoff topic well done.
786000	790000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week.
790000	795000	Alan, I usually let Dark Sakura start. She's not here. I'll let you start. How was your gaming week?
796000	801000	Good. Mass Effect 3, the DLC that came out, I've been playing the hell out of that.
802000	810000	You guys talked about it a little bit last week. The Collectors, which were the antagonists in 2, are now an enemy class that you can roll into in the multiplayer matches.
811000	816000	And I unlocked the Volus Adept, which is an ultra rare and seven unlockable character.
817000	822000	And I'm sure saying Volus Adept is the same as saying Pineapple Toaster Oven to most people in our listeners.
823000	829000	Pineapple Toaster Oven? Awesome! I like pineapple and I like toaster ovens. Sounds amazing.
830000	833000	I unlocked one of the new coveted secret characters.
834000	838000	How about a toaster oven that cuts the pineapple for you? So you don't have to.
839000	851000	I played some Black Mesa Source a little bit, but not as much as I have been because I already went through and beat it and I'm waiting for them to patch in the end of the game.
852000	859000	Mass Effect Infiltrator, because about three weeks ago I upgraded my phone. I now have a Galaxy S3.
860000	863000	I believe Bobby Blackwolf got one about a month ago.
864000	867000	So I downloaded the Infiltrator Mass Effect game for it.
868000	876000	It looks gorgeous, but it controls so bad that it makes me angry that I spent the four bucks on it.
877000	880000	It controls so poorly for me that it makes me feel like...
880000	889000	If you've ever had someone, like you show them a game like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto and it's someone who does not play video games and you have the controller and you're like,
890000	893000	okay, here's how you move and here's how you get in the car and then you just drive off a cliff.
894000	898000	The first thing you do is they just die because they don't know how to play games.
899000	902000	Infiltrator controls so poorly that it makes me feel like I'm one of those people.
903000	910000	And I told James about it and he has it on iPad and he said that he made himself beat it just because he has a boner for Mass Effect.
911000	914000	And he's like, oh yeah, the game's a total piece of shit. I can't believe I beat it all the way through.
915000	921000	I really wanted to like it. There's a lot to like about it. Like for a phone game, it looks really good.
922000	925000	Yeah, it looks like Mass Effect. It's an over-the-shoulder action game.
926000	929000	Because it's all with your thumbs. You just swipe to... it's horrible.
929000	934000	Stop trying to make touch gaming happen. Like it sucks for some of these hardcore franchises.
935000	938000	Well, Fruit Ninja, yes. For whatever they're doing in that game, no.
939000	949000	That's really it, I think. Oh, and Tiny Tower. I know a lot of Tiny Tower, which is like a two-year-old iPhone game.
950000	955000	But since you're coming off having the phone that doesn't even have a QWERTY keyboard on it, too.
955000	962000	I had the Blackberry equivalent of the Nokia brick. You know, the classic, you know, you throw the Nokia brick at a car and the car explodes.
963000	969000	And the brick is fine. I had the Blackberry equivalent of that. And now, so going from that to this Android ice cream sandwich.
970000	973000	Ooh, you know, little laptop in your pocket is quite a change.
974000	980000	Yeah, in Tiny Tower, I give all of my stores perverted names. The laundromat is called the Stank Panties.
980000	989000	I've got... the TV studio is named after a porn website, which I'm not going to say. So it's porn studio because of the name I gave it.
990000	994000	So yeah, it's good times. Good times killer game.
995000	1003000	Now, just to fan the flames of this, what made you decide to go with the Galaxy S3 on the day the iPhone 5 came out?
1004000	1012000	To be pragmatic about it, you represent the Apple portion of this household, which is fine. I'm not hating on that.
1013000	1023000	But it's like, if we want to be, you know, the ultimate geek duo, we need Android representation up in here so that people can come to us and they will ask Rob the Apple questions, they can ask me the Android questions.
1024000	1026000	If I want to be pragmatic about it, make sure all of our braces are covered.
1027000	1031000	That is the best possible answer you could have given. Good job. This is why I keep you here.
1031000	1033000	So I will investigate whatever it is that you don't like.
1034000	1036000	Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1037000	1043000	So when they ask you about the Apple stuff, like, why should I get an iPhone 5? Because it's new! You gotta get the new thing.
1044000	1051000	So this week I've actually been trying to catch up on a lot of stuff that I haven't been playing because I've been playing a lot of Minecraft or whatever.
1051000	1063000	So let's see. This week I played some Vita stuff. That was also another thing. I wanted to play games on the Vita because I haven't been and it was sorely neglected.
1064000	1078000	So I tried out a couple demos I had. First, Gravity Rush, which was pretty cool. Just not really something, I mean, it's a good game but it's not something I'm going to be playing because I just don't want to play a lot of different games right now.
1078000	1091000	I've already got plenty of my play right now but it's a unique looking game. It was fun. So I played that. I played Little Big Planet Vita. Well that was something I was like, oh, I'm probably going to get this but then I played it and it's Little Big Planet.
1092000	1102000	It's great but it's got, you know, the Vita gimmicks that you kind of expect in there and I was just kind of like, eh, it's another Little Big Planet game. Probably won't play this so I'm not going to get it.
1103000	1104000	That's kind of a bummer.
1104000	1113000	Well no, it's not that at all. It's a good game. It's just, I have Little Big Planet 2 that I haven't played. Why am I going to buy another Little Big Planet game that I probably won't play?
1114000	1122000	I need to finish other games first before, you know, I'm just trying not to get into that mode of like, I need to get all these games because they're good.
1123000	1130000	Then I'm going to be sitting on all these games that are good and not have time to play them and then more good stuff is going to come out and I'm not going to have time to play that.
1130000	1141000	I ended up, you know, there's a ton of games I have that are really old that I haven't played yet like 3D Dot Game Heroes. I've lent that out to so many people and I have yet to play that game.
1142000	1143000	It's a good game.
1144000	1153000	It is a good game. I know it's a good game but that game came out around the same time as like Red Dead Redemption or something and it was just like, ooh, Red Dead Redemption, you know, and I just kind of lost track of that.
1153000	1165000	We have a new story coming up later and maybe I'll mention it to them but there's this really good, really, really good sale going on right now on a bundle of games and they're like all things that people tell me I should play and I've missed.
1166000	1172000	And it's like, wow, for a very, very, very small amount of money I could like catch up on three years worth of gaming.
1173000	1179000	And for that amount of money I think it's a good deal even if you don't play them because that amount of money for one of those games is so-
1180000	1181000	We're getting ahead of ourselves though, sorry.
1181000	1190000	The game I actually did want to play and I bought it mainly because it came out on this platform first was Retro City Rampage.
1191000	1201000	I've been looking forward to this game forever now and they have the whole cross-buy thing on the PlayStation Network so you can get it for your PS3 and Vita so I bought it for my Vita and it's fantastic.
1201000	1208000	If I didn't have a cold, you know, at the point when I was playing it my body was aching and my eyes were just like burning.
1209000	1216000	If it wasn't for that I would probably have played a lot more of it but it's a fantastic game and there's just so many homages to everything.
1217000	1229000	It's just crammed full of just so much fan service and just like oh my god I remember that and even stuff that will probably fly over your head but it's a fantastic game.
1229000	1240000	It's just basically the best description I read for it was someone says the developers love letter to the industry for all the 8-bit games that he played and stuff like that.
1241000	1250000	It even has modern references and stuff in it but the story is just throwaway. It makes no sense whatsoever but it's got everything and it's seriously a great game.
1251000	1255000	So I am looking forward to playing that on my PlayStation 3 hopefully but on the Vita it's still pretty awesome.
1255000	1262000	Although the game does tend to make the screen a lot smaller like in different sections of the map and stuff like that.
1263000	1273000	So playing on a Vita, I'm sure it's not so bad on a TV but on the Vita the screen gets really small so that might be something that might turn people off from it but it's a fun game.
1274000	1283000	Especially if you like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 it's very much like that but even if you don't like Grand Theft Auto it's still a great action game with all sorts of crazy stuff in it.
1283000	1289000	From Bionic Commando to Bill and Ted to Back to the Future. It's great.
1290000	1296000	And then of course more Minecraft. I played a lot more Minecraft. I fished up my castle basically.
1297000	1301000	I don't know. Come join the server if you haven't yet.
1302000	1309000	And then Call of Duty we bought Map Pack 2 so we're going to start playing some new maps because we're just kind of getting bored of the ones we were playing.
1310000	1315000	Once again tried doing another streak week. Missed it by another game. Oh well.
1316000	1318000	Getting close. Getting close.
1319000	1324000	And what else? I think that was it actually. I think that was all the games I played.
1325000	1332000	So Alan you'll get a kick out of this. You know how the live listeners will understand this. Podcast listeners I apologize for a minute but we're having these stream dropouts.
1332000	1341000	It looks like it's happened twice. And yeah we just so you guys know we actually purposely left the internet off for an hour today while we went to go run errands.
1342000	1344000	The cable modem and the router off for an hour.
1345000	1352000	Let's do a complete power cycle of every damn technological thing in this house so OLR can stay up with no downtime tonight. Now we're on 2.
1353000	1360000	So it's like it is not in this house. Like the problem is not in this house. The problem is Comcast on their end.
1361000	1364000	Spell hey you know why you guys keep dropping our stuff.
1365000	1376000	Well I wonder if it's not because sometimes I see that we're still sending data and they start complaining in chat that it dropped and I'm like it didn't drop because I see that we're still sending data.
1377000	1382000	Because if Comcast goes down then our net should stop working. I should get booted from IRC. All of that should happen.
1383000	1387000	So that makes me wonder is it our stream provider that's really having the issue.
1388000	1389000	But it doesn't happen to Bobby.
1390000	1391000	That's right it doesn't happen to Bobby.
1392000	1393000	He's on it for an hour.
1394000	1395000	So what the hell is the problem?
1396000	1401000	Could be our is he where is sorry forget it all. Where's where's where's it located. Where where are we piping to right now.
1402000	1405000	That's a good question that I don't know the answer to that maybe Bobby does.
1406000	1411000	Because if it's in the Midwest or the South it could be our connection to there and he's you know Anna.
1412000	1417000	It very well could be. Let me see if this tells me where we beam the show to because I'm actually not sure.
1418000	1418000	
1419000	1420000	I know but you know what deal with it.
1421000	1425000	He says New Jersey so you would be infinitely closer.
1426000	1430000	Oh yeah so for us if we're piping in New Jersey then there's yeah it's probably the stream weird to us.
1431000	1434000	This is New Jersey so no wonder the streams oh stop it.
1435000	1437000	Who else do you want to offend tonight while we're at it.
1438000	1439000	We're still early and we haven't even started story.
1440000	1441000	You've done burlesque people.
1442000	1445000	New Jersey not saying there's anything wrong burlesque burlesque is awesome.
1446000	1450000	Because it's once again women stripping off their clothes which is you know that's fine.
1451000	1456000	I think really the only difference between burlesque and strippers the strippers kind of go all the way whereas burlesque is more of the teas and stuff.
1457000	1459000	Yeah but they're still stripping off their clothes.
1459000	1466000	They're just they're just like you know skin Amex strippers versus you know the stripper strippers.
1467000	1468000	I guess.
1469000	1470000	Oh boy all right.
1471000	1472000	Who spilled Jager and spray tan on the server rack.
1473000	1476000	Moving on to my gaming week.
1477000	1478000	I had a very dark soccer week.
1479000	1480000	My gaming week was very dark soccer.
1481000	1482000	Does everybody know what that means.
1483000	1483000	
1483000	1484000	That's right I played him.
1485000	1489000	No no no that's that's dark soccer circa 2009 gaming week.
1490000	1492000	My gaming week this week was I played a lot of wow.
1493000	1501000	I did some dailies and you know just I shouldn't say a lot of wow because I didn't play a lot of wow but I played you know because I've had weeks where I played a lot of wow.
1502000	1506000	But this is not one of those weeks but I played enough wow to do like a few dailies here and there and so forth.
1506000	1516000	And then I played Mass Effect 3 because as Alan mentioned the new DLC went up the multiplayer DLC and it's very well rounded.
1517000	1521000	It's got a whole new class of aliens that you can fight the collectors from part two.
1522000	1523000	So that breathes new life into it.
1524000	1525000	It has some new classes.
1526000	1535000	It doesn't matter because I won't be seeing them anyway because I never get that stuff in my premium specter packs but I did finally get one of the ones I really wanted.
1536000	1544000	It's called Cerberus Adept and I've been playing that class a lot because he's the guy with the whips and you're just like Hulk smash Hulk smash everything and it's great.
1545000	1546000	Vanguard's like that too.
1547000	1552000	Yeah it's awesome. Like we were doing a multiplayer match earlier with some friends and one of my friends was like who sent the body flying out the window.
1553000	1561000	I'm like me. So yeah Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is still really fun and I like that they've staggered this content a bit.
1561000	1568000	So like what is it every Tuesday we're going to get just a handful of new things right? Every Tuesday for a little while? That's awesome.
1569000	1575000	I don't know if they're doing it because there's 16 new kits where a kit is a character within a class.
1576000	1583000	So we got four of them. There's supposed to be 16 so that's only a month's worth if they're going to do four a week.
1584000	1585000	They should probably do every other week.
1586000	1587000	Maybe every other week. That would make it.
1587000	1593000	Because next weekend should be the next scenario challenge because they do that every other weekend.
1594000	1602000	And the other big thing they added is they have kind of like mini achievements now. Like it kind of runs on a similar system to like achievements or trophies but you're not unlocking official things.
1603000	1610000	They're not game achievements. It's within the multiplayer. Like you've used biotic charge 30,000 out of 50,000 times.
1611000	1616000	So when you hit the 50,000 and then you can unlock titles that appear next to your handle in game lobbies.
1617000	1621000	So kind of similar to like Street Fighter IV has that kind of similar idea there.
1622000	1626000	So that breathes some life into it too because it's like oh now I have all these things to work for.
1627000	1632000	Because if you've been a person that's been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer since launch which there is a lot of people that have been.
1633000	1637000	You've probably got all the other achievements by now. I mean there's not a lot else to work towards.
1638000	1642000	Alan, heck you haven't even been playing since launch but you're in seven score is what 800 and something now?
1642000	1649000	It's like 820 now. It would be higher but when I do golds and silvers I'm usually on a level 20 and they don't gain XP.
1650000	1656000	Oh okay. I see. Gotcha. Alright. Alright well that was my gaming week. So let's move into some housekeeping.
1657000	1662000	We are on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We are on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
1663000	1668000	I believe today or tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow, is the last day to nominate us for the podcast awards.
1669000	1679000	So please for your consideration, Best Gaming Podcast and the Stitcher Awards also going on right now and I think they end either tomorrow or Friday.
1680000	1687000	So please consider a nomination for us there as well for Best Gaming Podcast. If for whatever reason you don't want to vote for us that's cool.
1688000	1693000	Please support one of the other shows on the VOG Network or at least bare minimum support Indie Podcast.
1694000	1696000	And then Stitcher I believe it's every day or every day you can vote.
1696000	1701000	You can nominate for Stitcher every day. You can. So podcast award is just one nomination.
1702000	1708000	So we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed and let you know what happens either next week or in a couple weeks when those nominations are announced.
1709000	1719000	Remember you know usually I hate the whole begging for votes thing but it really is good exposure and these guys you know as much as some of these big podcasts are fine.
1719000	1728000	The NPR podcasts are great. Like wait wait don't tell me he's a great show. The Adam Carolla show is a fine show if you like him and all that.
1729000	1737000	But the problem you know they don't need the additional exposure. They have plenty of corporate exposure and stuff so we really want to see the indies succeed in these.
1738000	1742000	Because there's a lot of really good indie programs too. Just like there's good indie games.
1743000	1749000	Anyhow let's move on to the news. Oh wait no one other thing I got to plug. Very important.
1750000	1758000	I always like to plug the shows that are kind enough to invite me on as a guest. And I was a guest this week. I don't know how I fit this in this week but I did.
1759000	1771000	I was a guest on Nerdgasm Network their gaming show. It's episode 54. I don't think it was on their feed yet when I checked because they are having some website up seas and down seas but it will be you know very soon.
1772000	1782000	Nerdgasmnetwork.com so take a look for episode 54. I was on it. And I felt really bad because I had to go before they were done but it was just that kind of week last week.
1783000	1788000	So hopefully they'll have me back at some point because we had some funny in-jokes that were going on there so I had a good time.
1789000	1796000	So you'll hear more about putting it all out on the table and I'll just leave it at that. Alright let's get into some gaming news.
1796000	1804000	And Burlesque Top I guess. Yeah yes. Actually very similar to Burlesque but in a different way. Let's move on to gaming news Loki.
1805000	1818000	So it's another year so another Microsoft game has been leaked. Hurrah! Apparently Microsoft is investigating a report of Halo 4 being leaked and they're working with law enforcement to address the issue.
1818000	1828000	And you know there's images being surfaced on social networking sites depicting retail discs and a dashboard featuring the game ready to play blah blah blah.
1829000	1834000	It's already leaked. Yes it's absolutely 100% been leaked. It's out there.
1835000	1843000	And of course you know they're like well we're clarified with that's actually it's been leaked. 100% it's been leaked. Okay.
1843000	1854000	Has it been leaked? It's been leaked. I don't know that much more you can say other than it's pretty good.
1855000	1868000	And also I guess some other information. Apparently the game is going to be on two discs. The second disc is going to contain installation data for the multiplayer stuff and once you've installed that then you can actually play the game with the first disc.
1868000	1875000	Kind of like Forza 4. Now Loki help me understand something. How are people able to play this game before the release date?
1876000	1880000	Uhhhhh. Piracy. Oh. Okay.
1883000	1889000	But piracy is bad. It is bad and they will get banned if they go online. That's it. And Microsoft called the po-po.
1889000	1894000	Oh yeah. They're really investigating it. They're asking for it.
1895000	1906000	Look. Obviously they're going to say you know they're going to invoke the police because and you know it is a crime. You can poo poo it all you want but stealing shit is a crime. Right?
1906000	1923000	So but what will the police really do to investigate you think? Do you think the police is coming after little Johnny Pirate that went on the Pirate Bay and downloaded the program? Or do you think the police are looking more into how the leak happened?
1924000	1926000	I think they're trying to find out how it got leaked.
1927000	1941000	Well then the police aren't doing a very good job. I hate to say it but let's see Gears of War 3 leaked. Halo 3 leaked. Like every big Microsoft title leaks. Did Fable the Journey leak or did that just slip off the radar?
1941000	1951000	No. Any title like out there. Any title that's being released is leaked usually a week before it comes out. And the reason that happens is because that's how the shipment schedule is for retailers.
1952000	1965000	They usually get stuff you know Monday prior or you know if it's you know direct retail partners like say GameStop and Best Fies and stuff like that. They're getting their product probably the week before on Wednesday or something.
1966000	1970000	Now here's how I think this happened. And this is totally speculative. I have no...
1971000	1975000	This is not the week before. Halo's not supposed to be out till like for like three weeks.
1976000	1985000	Yeah exactly. Here's how I think it happened. Well a couple of ways. One, someone nabbed a copy when they were pressing it. You know an actual copy out of the duplicator.
1985000	2001000	Or this happens occasionally. The warehouse that ships the product, the Microsoft product, will misship something and accidentally send something early. Like way earlier than they were supposed to receive it in.
2001000	2016000	For example you know personally we had some Skylanders stuff you know for the new Skylanders Giants that they accidentally shipped us earlier than it should have been. Like about a week earlier. Which is usually unusual.
2017000	2021000	Well lucky you. Some lucky asshole got me Halo 4. You got Skylanders.
2021000	2041000	No no no. We're not doing anything with Skylanders. But I'm just saying it happens. There's been Microsoft released games in the last few weeks. We had Fable and then next week we've got Dance Central 3 and then we've got Forza Horizon. So there's going to be a lot of Microsoft shipments in the next few weeks.
2042000	2057000	So perhaps one of those got out and somebody unscriptedlessly bought it or got a copy and put it out there. Or who knows. It could have just been somewhere else. An employee. You never know. Because it's one of the biggest games.
2057000	2073000	This and probably Call of Duty Black Ops 2 are going to be like the ones. The scene groups out there fighting each other. Who's going to be able to release it first. And you know it's all bragging. All E-peen bragging rights basically. Like oh I'm playing Halo and you're not. So that's it.
2074000	2082000	So here's the question I have to ask. How can Microsoft stop this? How can Microsoft stop that leak from happening?
2083000	2100000	They can't. They have to be more secure about how they duplicate their game. Just the whole handling process of it. The way other publishers do it. At least they try to prevent street day violators is by delivering a product as late as possible to those retail chains.
2101000	2123000	So we're talking like you know getting a day early instead of a week early. That type of thing. But obviously it's something like this. This hasn't even. I mean as far as we're aware this hasn't even hit the retail chains yet. This is just some screw up somewhere where something either got shipped way earlier than it was supposed to or someone internally leaked it out.
2123000	2142000	That's the problem. But the team they have they've had problems with leaks just in the last few years all the time. I mean was it last year there was Gears of War 3. Remember that game got leaked down the Web. You know by Microsoft or I'm sorry it was a third party review company or some garbage that they were saying.
2142000	2164000	But basically the actual source code and I or it was like the source code in something was leaked out and you can actually download it off of an unencrypted Web site or something. It was just ridiculous. So yeah it's not good but I don't think it's really going to hurt them in the end. I mean they're still going to sell a buttload of those.
2164000	2193000	Yeah I mean the reality is you kind of have to ask yourself if you're going to download one of these games and so forth. Am I the type of person that sits there and goes aw every time I hear one of these stories about game developers closing or why did Big Bad EA close such and such developer or you know so forth. Yet I'm not allowing said company to make money. You kind of can't have both right.
2193000	2212000	Now I don't think people have to get paid. Yeah I don't think that's fair though. I think what you're basically saying though those are a lot of these secondary companies and stuff and some of it has nothing to do with you know how well the game sold for they need to cut profits because it didn't sell as many copies as they thought it would not necessarily because piracy ate up you know hundreds of thousands of copies.
2212000	2231000	I mean because once again that's assuming that every person that pirates something would have bought the game regularly. I bet you a lot of people that pirate the game are probably just they want to play it early and they're going to still buy their preorder when it comes out or you know they were never going to buy the game in the first place and they would have pirated it when it came out.
2231000	2248000	You know normally it's just that's once again you can't the industry can't just assume that each one of those is a lost sale as much as I don't want to agree with you I think I actually kind of do I think a vast number of people who pirate games were never going to buy that game in the first place.
2248000	2277000	I'm going to tell you this much. They only download it because they can. Exactly. And you know I I did with grant the thought of four grand thought of four came out it leaked down the Internet one week before it came out. I still bought the game. I want to play it right now. I want to play it as early as possible and so I did. I played it a week early but who cares. I think I've more than paid for it. I bought what six copies of the game when it came out and it's six copies of episodes from Liberty City when it came out and six copies of the first deal.
2277000	2290000	See before you know the episodes from Liberty City stuff came out. I think they got my money. So I don't feel so bad about you know playing the game a week early. I think this is why the industry is very eager to get on digital distribution.
2290000	2301000	I think this is why you see some companies may be rushing digital distribution and really trying to push it more and more is because if you think about it digital distribution is a great way to curb piracy.
2301000	2313000	It won't stop it but it would stop these leaks from happening because essentially you've cut out the entire process of printing the disks and the going gold and shipping and the problems there. You're cutting that all out.
2313000	2326000	No leaks out even earlier than games like this. Xbox Live arcade games. Wow. They leak out even earlier. No why. Why have access to partner net still people download them off partner net and they put them out.
2327000	2339000	They crack it and put it out. Yeah they crack and put out so digital distribute the people are going to find ways around everything. All they want to do is to cut out the mailman with that stuff so that means more profits for them. It's not going to curb more piracy people are going to find a way no matter what.
2339000	2353000	I mean no matter what they put out there people are going to find a way. But a game like you know Halo 4. Yeah it's going to get part of it. I mean all the games get pirated but I don't think that they're going to sell like it's not going to be like oh crap.
2353000	2376000	It didn't sell at all. That's not going to happen there. No one's going to shut down 343 studios because it didn't sell because of all piracy. It just ruined the whole game. No it's not like that. There's not that many people you know compared to the millions of people buy that pirate games is such a small section but they would want you to think it is because you know they got to blame their loss of sales on something.
2376000	2392000	Do you think though that if this hadn't happened maybe they would have sold a quarter million more copies. No because if this hadn't happened it's going to leak out again when it comes out and the same people will pirate it.
2392000	2411000	Rama in our chat room says Halo 4 could come out at $19.99 and yet it will be pirated. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com follows that up with iPhone piracy is rampant and that's 99 cent apps. I think that's a perfect example where it's like people do it because they can.
2411000	2428000	I mean if you're given someone the option to get some free versus paying for it. Why wouldn't you get it for free. I mean I understand that there's this whole morality of oh well if I don't pay. I mean they try to push this shit on you even in legality. You are taking a risk. I understand that but it's just OK.
2428000	2447000	It's it would be like I don't know it'd be like walking into a department store and all sudden there's like hundreds of looters inside there and they all scatter in every single direction. Good luck catching every single one of those. I mean it's a risk but you know the officer is not going to be able to catch every single person.
2447000	2465000	It's kind of the same way piracy. Yeah people get nabbed every now and then but there's so many people and so much piracy happening that you know it just has a hole like over everything that you can't catch everybody. The best defense is to stop the people that upload them in the first place and then there's nothing for them to pirate.
2465000	2475000	You know what though I think I could look you in the eye with a straight face and totally mean it and say you would never catch me down there being one of those looters. I just think it's wrong.
2475000	2486000	And like I would never participate in a looting event like that and I really believe that about my character like and I'm not trying to say like I'm better than anybody else or whatever but I know like they had a situation like that happen in Britain.
2487000	2497000	Not that long ago like there were these huge riots and all these things and there were these looting and you know a bunch of kids got caught went to jail and all this stuff and I remember looking at it going what a bunch of fucking thugs.
2497000	2510000	I wouldn't be one of those thugs. That is ridiculous that stuff. I mean my analogy was that there's how do you go after everybody. You can't. Yeah because yeah as a literal metaphor I don't really think that's the best comparison.
2510000	2519000	There's a huge difference between the plausible deniability of maybe downloading a torrent from the privacy of your own bedroom versus throwing a chair through a storefront window.
2519000	2526000	Of course once again the video game industry or the movie industry would like you to think that that's exactly the same thing.
2526000	2535000	Yes. The great debate that will never end. But maybe this is why we see more free to play games happening because it's like fuck it. We'll make our money other way.
2535000	2546000	No seriously that's a great idea. As long as you could secure DLC. But that's a great idea because then it's like fuck pirated as much as one gives me copies out there because that's more people that can buy the DLC for it.
2546000	2556000	And that's why I think it is more popular approach because it gets the game into more people's hands and more people want to try because it's free there. I if it sucks whatever I just delete it you know.
2556000	2572000	And that that's why I think it is a good way to go. But then again at the same time some of these companies are getting greedy and they're taking the free to play model for their paid games and that just pissing people off even more and they're like fuck you I'm just going to not only am I going to pirate this game but I'm also going to pirate all your DLC.
2573000	2580000	Alright well moving on. This piracy debate will never be settled so I'm going to go ahead in the interest of time and move on with the news.
2580000	2590000	But what a great segue talking about a game that a lot of people probably just should have pirated. Let's be real it wasn't very good. No I'm kidding. I'm trolling I'm trolling.
2590000	2596000	But pirated DLC and all that definitely goes with this too. It's Street Fighter X Tekken.
2596000	2598000	I'm sorry you can't pirate something that's already on the disc.
2602000	2610000	There's a whole nother argument we could save for another day. Is it piracy when it was on the disc anyway? We'll save that for next week.
2610000	2620000	Alright but moving on. This wasn't on the disc what I'm about to talk about. It's a free what they call hefty like the trash bags hefty update later this year.
2620000	2628000	It is supposed to rebalance the game, provide visual and mechanical tweaks which I find interesting that they're going to actually tweak some of the visuals.
2628000	2638000	Every character in Street Fighter X Tekken is supposed to get some type of balancing tweaks and so forth. Including Ken, Kazuya, Kami, Julia and so on and so on. Lots lots.
2638000	2649000	Also don't forget Street Fighter X Tekken is coming to the Vita. I don't know if that means these same balancing things are already in that finished version or if there's a day one patch or whatever.
2649000	2655000	But that is due on October 23rd as a reminder that's just around the corner Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.
2655000	2657000	Didn't that game flop?
2657000	2661000	I think flop is a strong word but I think it.
2661000	2663000	Just perform as well as they'd probably hope.
2663000	2671000	Word of mouth from friends who are usually like Capcom for life and just the reviews are like this is not very good.
2671000	2680000	What I'm really curious about is where's the other half of this because we were supposed to be seeing Tekken cross Street Fighter and I'm wondering.
2680000	2681000	I think it's still a long way away.
2681000	2683000	Namco just started working on it this year.
2683000	2684000	Wow.
2684000	2685000	Like began.
2685000	2688000	They already had their we're gonna Tekken tag too so.
2688000	2692000	Maybe they've been kind of developing them side by side.
2692000	2694000	They have the engine now they've made the engine so it's been.
2694000	2700000	This wasn't the their joint project for this was announced what two or three years ago right.
2700000	2705000	I think when they did the press release the Namcom is making one and Capcom is making one.
2705000	2707000	Yeah that was two or three years ago.
2707000	2708000	But yeah no.
2708000	2712000	Namco has only just now started even designing the game.
2712000	2714000	So maybe next year or the year after.
2714000	2723000	We'll see maybe maybe it'll be on the next generation of consoles maybe this is a PlayStation 4 game troll troll.
2723000	2731000	Although yes they were busy if they wait too long it's going to have to be if they wanted to sell but anyway let's move on.
2731000	2739000	To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase crown.
2739000	2742000	Do you live in the Seattle area.
2742000	2745000	If so no.
2745000	2752000	If you do you might want to head over to a valve software's website and take a little play tester survey.
2752000	2760000	And see if maybe you could become a hardware tester for their valve appliance which clearly exists in some form though.
2760000	2763000	They haven't given it a name and we don't know what exactly it has a fridge.
2763000	2766000	I hope it's a pineapple toaster oven.
2767000	2774000	So yeah and if you are in the Seattle and Bellevue area is it is that right.
2774000	2778000	They're looking for hardware testers and there's just it's a questionnaire.
2778000	2780000	How long have you been gaming.
2780000	2783000	Are you a completionist are you an achievement hunter.
2783000	2786000	How often do you unlock hundreds of everything.
2786000	2788000	How often do you beat like it.
2788000	2791000	Do you beat completely every game that you play from start to finish.
2791000	2793000	You would be qualified for this Rob.
2793000	2795000	Shut up.
2795000	2799000	Well you can expect people that go into this to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
2799000	2801000	Up through the teeth.
2801000	2803000	And you can expect that those will be broken.
2805000	2806000	Wait.
2806000	2810000	So from whatever however many months ago that they were looking for hardware engineers.
2810000	2815000	They have an alpha clearly that they are they want people under lock and key to go check out.
2815000	2816000	Very interesting.
2816000	2818000	Whatever their steam box is.
2818000	2820000	I look forward to what leaks out of this.
2822000	2824000	Moving on Loki.
2824000	2825000	Alright.
2825000	2831000	So of course remember that there was the announcement that Sony has bought Gaikai.
2831000	2837000	And so now Gaikai's website they've been updated to kind of resemble a little bit more of the PlayStation lineup.
2837000	2844000	You see images of living planet as well as uncharted and looks like kill zone in there as well.
2844000	2848000	They have some skills from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
2848000	2857000	And you know they didn't really say you know what any additional details or something.
2857000	2863000	But obviously it seems like this is something that's going to be offered as part of the PlayStation platform soon.
2863000	2870000	So you can probably expect some game streaming either by the end of this year or maybe an announcement E3.
2870000	2872000	Nothing else.
2872000	2875000	Unfortunately around the same time though.
2875000	2884000	So Gaikai they've kind of found themselves as part of a patent lawsuit on a Delaware company called T5 Labs.
2884000	2887000	They filed a suit against them.
2887000	2899000	I guess their patent for providing a system and methods of sharing and graphics processing unit between plurality of programs.
2900000	2905000	That's the patent.
2905000	2911000	Now I'm not sure if this is just a patent troll company or if this is actually a company that does this stuff.
2911000	2914000	But I'd be willing to bet it's probably a patent company.
2914000	2920000	So they have no comment on it but there is the lawsuit in place.
2920000	2923000	Is this what really put on live out of business.
2924000	2931000	Because I would have thought if anybody was going to complain it would have been you know one of the other companies that deals in this you know same technology.
2931000	2936000	I just you know I'm willing to bet the T5 Labs probably hasn't put anything out.
2936000	2938000	You probably can't even find them on the Internet.
2938000	2940000	I'm going to even check that out right now.
2940000	2942000	Let's see T5 Labs.
2942000	2946000	Let's see are they even a part of the Internet.
2946000	2952000	Here we go. T5 Labs dot com and.
2952000	2958000	And yeah it looks like they've got some just crappy flash animation on here.
2958000	2964000	But it's implied that it has to do with games because.
2964000	2973000	Because they've got static TV and it's tied to a server and what games do they make.
2973000	2980000	Oh good. They have these the whole Star Wars scroll on here because that's not annoying to read.
2980000	2984000	T5 Labs enables people to play PC games on their existing set top box.
2984000	2994000	There's the service operates on the video on demand client type system and says T5 Labs patent pending technology allows the system to work on the ultra low latency.
2994000	2997000	We call it instant gaming.
2998000	3001000	So it well that does sound like it does seem like.
3001000	3006000	Well it does seem like then that they are actually making something it's not a patent troll company.
3006000	3010000	So I guess I am corrected.
3010000	3016000	All right. But that is is refreshing to see that they're not just a patent troll.
3016000	3018000	All right well moving on.
3018000	3023000	I guess I'll troll you all by talking about Mass Effect because you know we don't shut up about that on this show.
3024000	3026000	I know you're a big fan of this.
3026000	3030000	Well Alan are you looking forward to the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC.
3030000	3033000	Why are you so excited about that.
3033000	3034000	Because it's Carrie-Anne Moss.
3034000	3036000	She's going to fucking shoot bitches in the face.
3036000	3039000	She's like fuck you. I'm Carrie-Anne Moss.
3039000	3043000	Like Carrie-Anne Moss was in the Matrix which was cool like 12 years ago.
3045000	3049000	She was also the mom in that Shayla Buff movie and I saw that.
3049000	3052000	Oh and she I think she's in the new Silent Hill movie as well actually.
3052000	3053000	Okay.
3053000	3056000	Yeah I think she's one of the crazy cool I think she plays the villainess I think.
3056000	3057000	Yeah.
3057000	3061000	So where was the Borg Queen last time. This time it's Carrie-Anne Moss.
3061000	3062000	There you go.
3062000	3068000	Well anyhow I suggest you do not fuck with Aria in the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC.
3068000	3073000	Which they are saying will be double the size of Leviathan.
3073000	3077000	Leviathan wasn't that big of a DLC campaign though.
3077000	3078000	It really wasn't.
3078000	3083000	Now Lair of the Shadow Broker is still the one that they need to beat as far as quality and length.
3083000	3089000	Because Lair of the Shadow Broker in Mass Effect 2 was a badass campaign from start to finish.
3089000	3091000	Yeah Lair of the Shadow Broker was great.
3091000	3096000	And especially if Omega is going to be kind of like a hub like the Shadow Broker Lair was that you got into.
3096000	3097000	Yeah.
3097000	3098000	That would be great.
3098000	3102000	Omega was probably one of the best design places in the entire trilogy.
3102000	3109000	Because if you're a science fiction geek like I am a lot of the design was based off of, oh I'm blanking.
3109000	3112000	Harrison Ford in the 80s. Blade Runner.
3112000	3116000	A lot of Omega is based off a lot of the scenes in Blade Runner.
3116000	3121000	And the music was amazing and I'm really glad that we're revisiting this place in 3.
3121000	3124000	Also the big news about this DLC.
3124000	3127000	Female Turians for the first time you're going to see.
3127000	3128000	Yeah.
3128000	3129000	Now.
3129000	3130000	Fans are wary.
3130000	3133000	There's always the comic books and so forth where they've shown up.
3133000	3137000	But the first time in the game is certainly a big deal.
3137000	3138000	Yeah.
3138000	3140000	The fans of course want to see.
3140000	3143000	When you say the fans you mean who?
3143000	3144000	Tumblr?
3144000	3145000	BioWare forms?
3145000	3146000	All of that.
3146000	3147000	The fandom.
3147000	3152000	Because a lot of people want to see female Turians because the entire trilogy.
3152000	3154000	How do Turians have sex?
3154000	3156000	Because clearly they're all men everywhere.
3157000	3162000	People are worried that they're just going to put a Turian head on tits armor.
3162000	3164000	And be like, there it is.
3164000	3166000	They're fucking reptiles they shouldn't have tits.
3166000	3167000	Thanks BioWare.
3167000	3169000	I'm interested to see what they do.
3169000	3174000	And when you're talking about all of it you've researched the fandom through extensive online research right?
3174000	3175000	Yes.
3175000	3177000	I track Mass Effect tags on Tumblr.
3177000	3180000	And what sorts of things do you participate with in the fandom?
3180000	3182000	I just reblog stuff and favorite stuff.
3182000	3183000	Have you ever written a fanfic?
3183000	3184000	No.
3184000	3185000	No I don't.
3185000	3187000	Have you ever read a fanfic?
3187000	3191000	I've read some hot M. Shenko stuff.
3191000	3194000	What was your favorite M. Shenko?
3194000	3201000	I think it was Caden was jogging through the citadel in booty shorts.
3201000	3210000	And everyone was catcalling him and Shepard was all flustered and offended.
3210000	3212000	Caden was like, I don't know.
3212000	3214000	I can't believe you actually had an answer for that.
3214000	3215000	That's great.
3215000	3219000	Anyhow, just trolling you live on air.
3219000	3227000	Anyhow, also apparently about this new DLC, one of Mass Effect 2's characters, Zaid Masani,
3227000	3229000	is supposed to return in this.
3229000	3231000	I don't remember him being in 3.
3231000	3233000	No, he was in 1 quest, wasn't he?
3233000	3236000	Yeah, he's in the quest with the little Volus from 1.
3236000	3237000	That's right.
3237000	3238000	And he's in the refugee camp.
3238000	3239000	You can talk to him.
3239000	3241000	Yes, Zaid sucked anyway.
3241000	3243000	Sorry, this is my opinion.
3243000	3247000	$15 for the DLC, which is on the pricier end of Mass Effect.
3247000	3248000	Absolutely.
3248000	3250000	Is that more than Shadow Broker was?
3250000	3253000	Was Shadow Broker $10 or was Shadow Broker also $15?
3253000	3255000	I think it might be $8 or $9 now.
3255000	3257000	I don't know how much it was back in 2011.
3257000	3262000	Well, it's going to cost you $15 now, so hopefully there will be enough to substantiate that.
3262000	3267000	Now, if you look at the multiplayer, even if you don't play multiplayer at all, which,
3267000	3271000	if you don't, I do think you should give Mass Effect 3 a shot.
3271000	3274000	If you're scared that like, oh, I'm going to suck at multiplayer or whatever,
3274000	3277000	or I don't like first person shooters or whatever, I do urge you,
3277000	3282000	give Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a shot because the fact that it's all co-op based
3282000	3287000	gives it a much different feeling than playing Halo or Modern Warfare Online.
3287000	3290000	I've never had a bad experience, but I'm on the PC model,
3290000	3294000	which is probably the smallest base of all the multiplayer because they're not integrated.
3294000	3297000	PS3's got its own thing and XBLA's got its own thing.
3297000	3301000	Believe it or not, on the 360, I've never had a bad experience.
3301000	3307000	Go figure. Outside of connection issues, but it's better on the 360 than it is on Origin.
3307000	3312000	But that's another story. Anyway, the new DLC gives you a great idea
3312000	3316000	of probably what you're going to see in this Omega expansion.
3316000	3319000	I mean, I can't see how they're not going to use the collector stuff.
3319000	3321000	I mean, if they've done all the work to put them into multiplayer,
3321000	3325000	I can't see how they're not going to show up somehow.
3326000	3328000	It'd be very easy to justify in the lore.
3328000	3331000	Yeah, I was going to say, even though Cerberus took Omega,
3331000	3333000	I'm sure there's a way to work it.
3333000	3337000	And Cerberus... I'm going to get so nerdy in the ending of 2.
3337000	3341000	Cerberus took the remnants of the collector base at the end of 2,
3341000	3343000	even if you blow it up, they still have it.
3343000	3345000	So they could be controlling the collectors now,
3345000	3348000	or the collectors show up and ambush both you and Cerberus.
3348000	3349000	Either way.
3349000	3353000	Shane Alinko in chat says they say that it's Cerberus, Rob, for Omega.
3353000	3356000	So that means nothing but Cerberus is going to show up?
3356000	3359000	Yeah, but that could be the plot twist, that the collectors are there too.
3359000	3362000	But yeah, all through 3, Arya talks about how it's Cerberus.
3362000	3365000	The Illusive Man kicked her out, and she's pissed.
3365000	3369000	And then, of course, maybe some of these other weapons
3369000	3372000	that have been showing up and so forth, and even maybe the maps,
3372000	3377000	because multiplayer maps get used in single-player sometimes.
3377000	3382000	Yeah, a lot of the multiplayer maps are unique to multiplayer, though.
3382000	3384000	Not originally.
3384000	3387000	But you definitely see some multiplayer maps,
3387000	3389000	or you see some single, like in the Leviathan DLC,
3389000	3393000	I could have sworn one of those maps looked a lot like one of the multiplayer maps,
3393000	3394000	but it was just kind of different.
3394000	3398000	It was a different layout, but kind of like the same assets.
3398000	3403000	Anyhow, all right, enough Mass Effect talk. Loki's getting bored.
3403000	3406000	I'm sorry, I just totally tuned out that whole last segment.
3406000	3408000	All right, hater, let's move on.
3408000	3411000	Maybe you'll be more interested in what Alan has to say.
3412000	3414000	Remember Darkstalkers?
3414000	3417000	2D fighting game, really creative characters,
3417000	3419000	really underrated franchise.
3419000	3421000	Well, Capcom is bringing it back.
3421000	3425000	Darkstalkers Resurrection was announced at New York Comic-Con this past week,
3425000	3430000	and it is a HD cleanup of Darkstalkers 2 and 3,
3430000	3435000	and it's bundled together in one pack, similar to Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.
3435000	3439000	And also, if you remember the Final Fight Magic Sword combo,
3439000	3442000	where you can have it look like an arcade cabinet or you can have it be full screen,
3442000	3445000	it's going to be a package like one of those.
3445000	3452000	And it's going to be, I think, 1200 Microsoft points or 1499.
3452000	3454000	So, yay, Darkstalkers.
3454000	3455000	Were you a fan of Darkstalkers?
3455000	3463000	Oh, I had a modded Saturn, Sega Saturn, and I imported Darkstalkers 3.
3463000	3464000	Nice.
3464000	3468000	Because it used the 4-meg RAM cart for the people that played X-Men vs. Street Fighter on the Saturn,
3468000	3469000	if you remember that.
3469000	3472000	It supported the 4-meg RAM cart. It was arcade perfect. It was gorgeous.
3472000	3476000	Do you think you'll be picking this up?
3476000	3480000	I'm going to say no, just because how often do I turn on the 360?
3480000	3481000	Seriously.
3481000	3484000	Fair enough. Well, if they ever shut down the Mass Effect 3 servers,
3484000	3486000	maybe you'll have a reason to.
3486000	3489000	Yeah, it's possible.
3489000	3492000	Mass Effect 4 Xbox exclusive, what are you going to do?
3492000	3494000	What are you going to do?
3494000	3495000	I'm just kidding. I'm trolling them.
3496000	3500000	Didn't they announce a new Darkstalkers game, or was this all the announcement was?
3500000	3504000	I think they were teasing that something was going to happen,
3504000	3506000	and I think this is that something,
3506000	3512000	but obviously I think it's trying to either get people talking about Darkstalkers again,
3512000	3515000	or to gauge interest for a new Darkstalkers.
3515000	3518000	I kind of think this is where Capcom's going.
3518000	3521000	I think there's interest to get this franchise revitalized,
3522000	3526000	and I'm sure this is a big step in either getting the awareness out there
3526000	3531000	before a possible E3 announcement, or gauging it in the first place.
3531000	3533000	A lot of people don't realize,
3533000	3537000	well, the real people who've been with Capcom since the beginning will know this,
3537000	3540000	but the combo system used in X-Men vs. Street Fighter,
3540000	3542000	and the combo system used in Marvel vs. Capcom,
3542000	3544000	the light, light, medium, medium, hard, hard,
3544000	3547000	where you do the zigzag across all six buttons,
3547000	3550000	that chain combo system, that was done in Darkstalkers.
3550000	3554000	That's the engine that they did that crazy combo system in.
3555000	3558000	Wasn't that also Killer Instinct? You could kind of do that too?
3558000	3561000	Those were weird, like Link.
3561000	3563000	Those were very specific things you had to do.
3563000	3566000	When you say zigzag combos with the six buttons, that's honestly what I think of.
3566000	3570000	I think of Killer Instinct before I think of that, but I get you.
3570000	3572000	All right, well, let's travel around the world
3572000	3575000	and look at some release dates of some games coming out near you
3575000	3578000	a little sooner than Darkstalkers, perhaps.
3578000	3580000	Let's start with the US, Loki.
3580000	3582000	All right, so let's see here.
3582000	3586000	This week, we have quite a few things coming out,
3586000	3592000	starting off with Rocksmith, guitar and bass.
3592000	3594000	Technically, it's like the first game with the bass expansion,
3594000	3598000	but they've got that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC,
3598000	3603000	as well as bundled with an electric guitar.
3603000	3608000	Dance Central 3 coming out this week on Xbox 360.
3608000	3612000	Mugen Souls on PlayStation 3.
3612000	3615000	Also, let's see here.
3615000	3625000	We've got 007 Legends on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3625000	3626000	What else here?
3626000	3632000	Doom 3 BFG Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3632000	3637000	Noomba Fitness Core on the Wii and Xbox 360.
3637000	3640000	Jeopardy on PS3 and 360.
3640000	3643000	Wheel of Fortune also on PS3 and 360.
3643000	3646000	Silent Hill Book of Memories for the Vita.
3646000	3648000	Man, that's been delayed forever.
3648000	3651000	That's finally coming out.
3651000	3653000	That was delayed quite a bit.
3653000	3657000	Yeah, because I don't think it was very good from what I hear.
3657000	3659000	Maybe they made it better.
3659000	3660000	I certainly hope so.
3660000	3663000	Otherwise, it's going to be kind of a disappointment.
3663000	3668000	Not that I'm not used to them being a disappointment.
3668000	3669000	Let's see, what else?
3669000	3672000	I do know that one week from today,
3672000	3675000	because they have to launch it on a Sunday because it's so special,
3675000	3681000	Skylighter Giants coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS,
3681000	3684000	and I think that's it.
3684000	3686000	Also, they're going to have a portal owner's pack
3686000	3688000	in case you think about the first game.
3688000	3691000	So that would be it.
3691000	3694000	All right, let's travel to Japan and look out there.
3694000	3696000	Actually, wait, I want to read a comment from chat real quick.
3696000	3699000	Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
3699000	3702000	when are they going to do a rock smith for keyboards?
3702000	3704000	Like, keyboard smith.
3704000	3706000	If they do that, I am so there.
3706000	3709000	Like, I'm not that interested in learning how to play guitar, honestly,
3709000	3713000	but I used to play the organ,
3713000	3716000	like the double-decker pianos with top and bottom.
3716000	3719000	I used to play that when I was younger, like way younger, like 5 to 10,
3719000	3723000	and I can still kind of hunt and peck my way around a piano or whatever,
3723000	3726000	but if they were to do this so I could, like, refine my skills,
3726000	3728000	I am so there.
3728000	3730000	If I could, like, you know, because I really enjoy it in Rock Band 3.
3730000	3732000	I really do.
3732000	3735000	Remember the keyboard main that they had for the actual keyboard?
3735000	3736000	It was on PC?
3736000	3739000	Yeah, I do. Yeah. I didn't own it, but...
3739000	3741000	Did you ever play Rock Band 3?
3741000	3744000	Of course I played Rock Band 3. I loved the keyboard mode in Rock Band 3.
3744000	3747000	Yeah, and then there was Keyboard Mania, of course, many years ago in Japan,
3747000	3749000	and that was fun, too.
3749000	3751000	That was always my favorite of the Moana games,
3751000	3754000	even though it was horribly neglected.
3754000	3757000	Anyhow, let's go to Japan and check out some games coming out over there.
3757000	3764000	Monster Hunter Frontier Online Forward 5 Premium Package on the Xbox 360 on the 17th.
3764000	3767000	That is also, I guess, coming...
3767000	3770000	I guess there's a bundle with Xbox Live Points you can get, too,
3770000	3772000	I guess, for some of the transactions in the game.
3772000	3776000	Well, I think Monster Hunter Online for them is actually a monthly fee.
3776000	3779000	Oh, okay, so that's probably a points recurring fee.
3779000	3783000	Dance Central 3 gets a Japanese release on October 18th.
3783000	3787000	Darksiders 2 gets a Japanese release on October 18th,
3787000	3789000	as does FIFA 13 World Class Soccer.
3789000	3794000	Again, those are all Xbox 360 for the few 360 owners in Japan.
3794000	3798000	Interesting about Dance Central 3, I'm imagining it's got to be the same song list.
3798000	3802000	I don't think they localize for the area or whatever,
3802000	3804000	so don't get excited if you're a J-Pop fan.
3804000	3806000	I don't think there's anything to look for there,
3806000	3809000	but interesting that they got such a quick turnaround.
3809000	3812000	It is very disappointing that they don't have Wild Wild West like they do,
3812000	3814000	or just Dance 4.
3814000	3819000	On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 and FIFA 13
3819000	3823000	also coming there on the PlayStation 3 on the 18th.
3823000	3825000	Let's see, going to some of the handhelds.
3825000	3828000	On the Vita this week, FIFA 13 is there as well,
3828000	3834000	and The Legend of Heroes Zero no Kisuke Evolution comes out on the PlayStation Vita.
3834000	3839000	Just saying, if you haven't bought the Vita version of FIFA 13,
3839000	3841000	you may want to hold off.
3841000	3842000	Why is that?
3842000	3844000	It's exactly the same as FIFA 12.
3844000	3846000	Oh, I thought that was the Wii version.
3846000	3847000	Both of them.
3847000	3848000	Oh, no.
3848000	3850000	Bastards.
3850000	3856000	And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Project X Zone on October 19th from Namco Bandai.
3856000	3857000	That's pretty awesome.
3857000	3860000	Those are your Japanese release dates.
3860000	3864000	Alan, would you care to take us to the land of all things Britain?
3864000	3865000	Sure.
3865000	3866000	And UK-ish?
3866000	3872000	October 15th has The War Z, or The War Zed, coming out on PC.
3872000	3877000	October 17th, we've got Serious Sam 3 BFE on Xbox 360
3877000	3881000	and The Unfinished Swan on PlayStation 3.
3881000	3886000	19th of October, 007 Legends on 360 and PS3.
3886000	3888000	Dance Central 3 on the 360.
3888000	3893000	Doom 3 BFG Edition on the 360, PS3, and PC.
3893000	3900000	Madagascar 3, the video game, which I'm sure is going to be the best game released this year,
3900000	3902000	because movie tie-in games are always phenomenal,
3902000	3907000	on 360, PS3, DS, PC, 3DS, and Wii.
3907000	3911000	Those big cross-platform juggernauts.
3911000	3913000	RockSmith on PC.
3913000	3917000	Skylanders Giants on Wii, iPhone, 360, PS3, and PC.
3917000	3920000	Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.
3920000	3923000	And that is it.
3923000	3925000	Just a few more news stories for you guys,
3925000	3928000	and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
3928000	3931000	Dark Soccer isn't here, so we're taking over.
3931000	3933000	See what we picked in a minute.
3933000	3935000	But first, Loki.
3935000	3938000	Apparently, SingStar is going to be a free-to-play game pretty soon.
3938000	3942000	Which kind of makes sense, because when you buy SingStar, you get some songs,
3942000	3946000	but it's basically just a platform to buy more songs.
3946000	3948000	If you look at Rob's library, that shit ain't free.
3948000	3950000	Shut up.
3950000	3956000	Hey, don't be a jealous hater, because I have SingStar Abba, which is awesome,
3956000	3958000	SingStar Queen, which is awesome,
3959000	3962000	and SingStar 1 and 2 on the PlayStation 3, which are okay.
3962000	3965000	And how many songs a la carte that you've bought?
3965000	3967000	Enough.
3967000	3968000	Enough to have a party.
3968000	3971000	Enough to entertain my guests when there's a SingStar.
3971000	3973000	And I've been collecting them since I lived at that house with John.
3973000	3976000	We don't really have parties here in the tiny apartment,
3976000	3979000	but when I lived in the house with John where OLR was in the garage studio,
3979000	3983000	we used to have SingStar parties, and we had a good time.
3983000	3985000	And a lot of those I bought on sale, to be fair.
3985000	3988000	I bought SingStar Queen at the local flea market for like eight bucks.
3988000	3989000	How are you going to say no to that?
3989000	3990000	And it was new.
3990000	3994000	It was brand new, still wrapped.
3994000	3997000	Apparently you still need the microphone, obviously, to play the game,
3997000	4004000	but I guess there is a message now popping up on the SingStar games.
4004000	4007000	They're basically saying the complete SingStar experience will be available
4007000	4010000	as a free download very soon.
4010000	4016000	And apparently they're going to offer that as a download,
4016000	4018000	and then you buy the song separately, I guess.
4018000	4021000	Which I think that's kind of cool, because if you think about it,
4021000	4025000	they did something similar with the PSP version of Rock Band,
4025000	4028000	where they had a demo that you can get, and it came with a couple songs,
4028000	4031000	and then you just build your own rock band library.
4031000	4035000	Instead of paying 40 bucks or whatever for the game,
4035000	4039000	you can save that money and buy 40 bucks worth of songs that you want to sing.
4039000	4041000	Maybe you don't like all of ABBA's songs.
4041000	4042000	Maybe you only like a couple.
4042000	4046000	You buy a couple ABBA songs, and you buy some Britney Spears or something.
4046000	4047000	I'm sorry.
4047000	4051000	Who the fuck is going to be satisfied with only a couple of ABBA songs?
4051000	4055000	If only a couple ABBA songs is what it takes to satisfy you,
4055000	4056000	get out of here.
4056000	4062000	Maybe those people want to spend their money on Queen or something like that.
4062000	4065000	Look, if you're on a limited income, then I understand.
4065000	4070000	But you need to set up your monthly ABBA plan to get you on your path.
4076000	4077000	Good idea for Sony?
4077000	4078000	I think it's a good idea.
4078000	4079000	Might as well.
4079000	4082000	They haven't really done anything with SingStar in a while.
4082000	4084000	I think it's a good idea, because it's going to get more exposure for people,
4084000	4087000	and because the SingStar games don't really sell that well.
4087000	4089000	I mean, they really don't.
4089000	4090000	They don't?
4090000	4092000	No, they don't.
4092000	4094000	I bet they do overseas a lot better.
4094000	4096000	They probably do overseas, but honestly,
4096000	4098000	karaoke games don't do very well.
4098000	4100000	But everybody's got a USB microphone,
4100000	4104000	especially those wonderful Logitech microphones that they put in everything.
4104000	4106000	They work on pretty much all systems.
4106000	4109000	So you get one of those in a throwaway game,
4109000	4113000	like Truth or Lies or something like that.
4113000	4114000	I don't know.
4114000	4118000	And you've got a SingStar mic.
4118000	4120000	Well, actually, no, those SingStar mics are different.
4120000	4123000	But still, I mean, you could find a bundle for SingStar
4123000	4125000	for, like, dirt cheap somewhere.
4125000	4127000	I'm sure that, like, a GameStop or Walmart or something
4127000	4129000	has them in their dump bin.
4129000	4133000	Just go looking for it.
4133000	4134000	All right.
4134000	4137000	Well, let's move on to one more story about, you know,
4137000	4140000	this always pisses people off when there's content on the disk
4140000	4145000	that they call DLC, and you have to pay to unlock it,
4145000	4148000	which, you know, we started using the term pay-to-unlock content
4148000	4150000	instead of DLC for certain things.
4150000	4153000	Well, when it was discovered that Resident Evil 6
4153000	4156000	has some things locked away on the disk,
4156000	4159000	everybody was like, oh, here we go again, Capcom.
4159000	4162000	Pay-to-unlock DLC.
4162000	4167000	But apparently Capcom announced that the things that were found on the disk,
4167000	4173000	including no hope difficulty level and co-op for Ada Wong's campaign,
4173000	4179000	these will be freebies, and they will be a free title update coming soon.
4179000	4182000	So no word if they only made it free because they got caught.
4182000	4185000	Or I actually, you know, all trolling aside,
4185000	4188000	I can see the value of doing free DLC
4188000	4192000	because it extends the life of your game past the first week,
4192000	4195000	especially in the very busy holiday season
4195000	4198000	where there are so many games competing for your attention.
4198000	4201000	I can actually see the value of this.
4201000	4204000	So, you know, I can't believe I'm about to say this,
4204000	4208000	but good on Capcom in this case.
4208000	4211000	It's just so they can release a gold edition of the game later on
4211000	4214000	with the actual stuff unlocked already.
4214000	4216000	That's what they did before with Resident Evil 5.
4216000	4218000	Remember they had all that, like, PlayStation Move updates?
4218000	4221000	Just reprint all of it and put it in the new gold box?
4221000	4224000	We'll put it in the gold box and we'll sell it again and people will buy it.
4224000	4227000	I mean, that's what's going to happen.
4227000	4230000	Now it is coming out that there will be paid DLC,
4230000	4234000	but it will not already be on the disk. It's coming later.
4235000	4238000	So, all right.
4238000	4244000	Let's move on to a time when there wasn't even a Resident Evil 1 yet.
4244000	4246000	I don't think when this game originally came out.
4246000	4248000	Maybe one was out. I don't know.
4248000	4249000	There was.
4249000	4251000	There was a 1. All right.
4251000	4254000	But, okay, back when the Resident Evil series was good.
4254000	4257000	There was no download content.
4257000	4259000	That's right. There was no download content.
4259000	4262000	When Resident Evil 2 was going to be on the N64. Remember that?
4262000	4264000	Oh, yes, I do. I do.
4264000	4266000	It's a classic game of the week.
4266000	4268000	Dark Soccer. She ain't here again.
4268000	4271000	So we've snatched her pick away from her
4271000	4274000	and we've picked an awesome game in her place
4274000	4276000	that we think you guys should be playing this week.
4276000	4277000	And we gave it to Alan this week.
4277000	4280000	So, Alan, what is your classic game of the week?
4280000	4282000	Well, usually when I do this segment,
4282000	4286000	I do, like, old Sierra Online PC games or, like, LucasArts.
4286000	4289000	So I wanted to give consoles love this time.
4289000	4292000	And I wanted to do something handheld
4292000	4297000	because I don't think handheld gets that much love in this segment.
4297000	4305000	So I chose Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages
4305000	4310000	for the Game Boy Color because they are super awesome.
4310000	4316000	Legend of Zelda, Seasons, and Ages came out together, obviously,
4316000	4321000	because you can play one, you get this huge, massive password code
4321000	4325000	that you then plug into the next game and then you continue the story.
4325000	4328000	And once you beat both of the games,
4328000	4331000	so you play one, you get your code, you play the other one,
4331000	4335000	then you get to fight Ganon, who's the secret boss,
4335000	4338000	and then you get to see Zelda proper and you get the real ending.
4338000	4343000	And one of the big deals about this game
4343000	4348000	was the fact that Nintendo did not develop or design it.
4348000	4353000	They let a subsidiary of Capcom, called Flagship,
4353000	4356000	write and code and design the game and Nintendo simply published it.
4356000	4359000	And I think that may be one of the first times
4359000	4363000	Nintendo has ever let a blue chip franchise
4363000	4365000	be in the hands of someone else.
4365000	4368000	Now it's not that rare because Sega has done stuff
4368000	4372000	and there was that Metroid game that was done by Team Ninja.
4372000	4379000	This game came out in the US in May of 2001,
4379000	4384000	which was the month before the Game Boy Advance console proper came out.
4384000	4387000	So this is one of the last games for the Game Boy Color
4387000	4390000	before that generation was phased out and the Advance took over.
4390000	4396000	Some of the best Game Boy Color graphics that you'll probably ever see.
4396000	4400000	And even looking on the YouTube, that looks pretty good.
4401000	4404000	It's like eight colors, I think, on the Game Boy Color.
4404000	4407000	Yeah, so if you play one game,
4407000	4411000	some of the items that you get are upgradeable in the second game.
4411000	4414000	There are a lot of little side quests and little...
4414000	4417000	Look at these little cartoony cut scenes too for Game Boy Color.
4417000	4418000	Yeah.
4421000	4426000	So if you play both games, depending on which order you play them in,
4426000	4431000	you can upgrade certain...
4431000	4435000	Like the hookshot and bloom ring, certain items you can upgrade
4435000	4437000	to a tier that you couldn't normally get
4437000	4441000	if you bring all of your equipment and stuff over into the next game.
4441000	4444000	In Oracle of Ages, there is a time mechanic
4444000	4447000	where you speed up time or slow down time to get past...
4447000	4450000	To solve certain puzzles in the dungeons
4450000	4452000	or on the overworld to actually get into the dungeon.
4452000	4456000	In Oracle of Seasons, you have a rod that will...
4456000	4458000	If there's a river, you'll make it winter
4458000	4461000	and the water will freeze so you can cross the river.
4461000	4462000	Stuff like that.
4462000	4465000	Was this the game that had the advanced dungeons
4465000	4467000	or was that one of the other Game Boy games?
4467000	4470000	That was Link's Awakening DX, wasn't it?
4470000	4473000	One of them you could plug into the Game Boy Advance
4473000	4475000	and then there would be this special...
4475000	4477000	Actually, maybe it was the Advance Shop.
4477000	4478000	I think it was something...
4478000	4479000	Because you say this one...
4479000	4480000	Because I remember playing it
4480000	4482000	and this was right on that cusp of when
4482000	4484000	the Game Boy Advance first came out, right?
4484000	4485000	Yeah, it was a month before.
4485000	4487000	So, you know what? I think it was this game.
4487000	4489000	Because I think I remember playing it on the Advance
4489000	4492000	and the Advance had some special little thing in it.
4492000	4495000	I'm not sure about that.
4495000	4498000	I think you're thinking of the re-release of Link's Awakening.
4498000	4499000	Maybe I am.
4499000	4501000	Somebody in chat will correct me.
4501000	4503000	That's the lovely part of doing a live show.
4503000	4507000	One of the awesome things about the Legend of Zelda handheld games
4507000	4508000	is that...
4508000	4511000	Nintendo, Miyamoto has even come out and said this.
4511000	4513000	In the handheld Zelda games,
4513000	4517000	they will allow themselves to do things with the franchise
4517000	4520000	and with the mechanics and the story that they simply can't do
4520000	4521000	on the console versions.
4521000	4524000	Because the console ones are obviously the big deal.
4524000	4527000	Now with Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword,
4527000	4530000	even Wind Waker,
4530000	4532000	they still find ways either with the art direction
4532000	4535000	or the werewolf mechanic.
4535000	4538000	They're always coming up with stuff to keep the series fresh,
4538000	4541000	but you're always going to have the three medallions,
4541000	4543000	you're always going to have the Master Sword,
4543000	4545000	you're always going to fight Ganon.
4545000	4548000	There are these staple things that are always in those games.
4548000	4553000	In the handheld ones, like Oracle of Seasons and Ages' Minish Cap,
4553000	4556000	Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass,
4556000	4559000	that's when they really get super creative
4559000	4561000	with the world of Hyrule
4561000	4563000	and the stuff that you can do.
4563000	4565000	They usually introduce a lot of new characters
4565000	4569000	that you'll never really see again in the handheld games.
4569000	4574000	Link's Awakening, with the fish or whatever that's sleeping,
4574000	4578000	that whole plot was inspired by Twin Peaks.
4578000	4580000	Do you know it? Because you're a big Twin Peaks fan, right?
4580000	4581000	Yes, I do.
4581000	4588000	Yeah, so that's just an example of how Zelda really shines
4588000	4591000	in a lot of unique ways on the handheld systems.
4591000	4594000	Now, I did some research, and the Advanced Shop was
4594000	4596000	Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.
4596000	4598000	It was a shop. It was not a dungeon.
4598000	4600000	I think I called it the Advanced Dungeon at first.
4600000	4602000	That's probably what confused you.
4602000	4605000	When these games are played on a Game Boy Advance,
4605000	4606000	there is a shop.
4606000	4609000	They have two seed rings and a gasha seed.
4609000	4612000	Depending on the game, it's either the GBA time ring
4612000	4615000	or the GBA nature ring, while the other is a random ring.
4615000	4617000	Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right.
4617000	4619000	I remember it's right here in the article.
4619000	4622000	Since this was so close to the Game Boy Advance release,
4622000	4625000	if you played it on the Advance in addition to that shop,
4625000	4627000	the graphics were also much improved.
4627000	4632000	So they had obviously not Game Boy Advance quality graphics,
4632000	4634000	but the color palette and the clarity of the pixels,
4634000	4637000	they actually was coded onto the Game Boy Color cartridge
4637000	4638000	to be read by the Advance.
4638000	4639000	That's awesome.
4639000	4643000	So, yeah, if you look this up on YouTube,
4643000	4647000	try to find the Advance run-throughs.
4647000	4651000	As far as how it played, again, it's Legend of Zelda.
4651000	4654000	If you've played Minish Cap, Link to the Past,
4654000	4658000	the first Zelda game, you know, overhead,
4658000	4660000	big expansive map, you go into dungeons,
4660000	4664000	you have to beat the dungeons in a certain order
4664000	4666000	because the items that you get in the dungeon,
4666000	4668000	the treasure is what you'll need to solve puzzles
4668000	4672000	in the dungeon after that, and so on and so forth.
4672000	4676000	The main antagonists, I believe, are Twinrova.
4676000	4679000	I think the double witches could be wrong there.
4679000	4681000	It's been so long since I've played this.
4681000	4684000	But, yeah, there are these...
4684000	4686000	The oracles are these ladies that you meet
4686000	4689000	when you're transported to these new worlds.
4689000	4691000	These games don't take place in Hyrule
4691000	4693000	like a lot of the handheld games.
4693000	4697000	So, yeah, they are in danger, and there's...
4697000	4700000	Naru is one, and Din, I think, is the other one.
4700000	4703000	So you rescue them, and then as you progress through,
4703000	4705000	you beat the one game and you play the other one.
4705000	4708000	And you do figure out finally how Zelda and Ganon
4708000	4710000	and the Triforce factor into it.
4710000	4712000	They're a lot of fun. If you're a big Zelda fan
4712000	4715000	and you haven't played these, you're missing out.
4715000	4718000	All right, good pick. Your classic game of the week,
4718000	4721000	The Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Ages, and Oracle of Seasons.
4721000	4723000	Two games for the price of one.
4723000	4724000	Yes.
4724000	4726000	All right, thank you very much, Alan. Good pick.
4726000	4728000	I think Jamie would be happy.
4728000	4731000	All right, well, that's going to do it for Part A of our show,
4731000	4733000	but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more show to come
4733000	4735000	as we get back, including some rapid-fire news,
4735000	4738000	the FUGO Question of the Week, and some interesting rumors
4738000	4741000	about Miyamoto's new direction.
4741000	4746000	And an event coming up appropriately named Fuck This Jam.
4746000	4749000	We'll talk about that. It's not our event. It's somebody else's.
4749000	4751000	We'll talk about that a little more when we come back
4751000	4754000	after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4759000	4762000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4762000	4766000	We are live with the 477th episode of our show
4766000	4769000	here at vognetwork.com, The Voice of Geeks Network.
4769000	4772000	And looking at the chatroom during the break there
4772000	4777000	at live.vognetwork.com, looks like Bobby's talking to some of the people
4777000	4780000	in there about his experience with the drill
4780000	4782000	and some of the band stuff that he does.
4782000	4785000	I know he does a lot of that stuff professionally.
4785000	4787000	Little-known fact, I did marching band in high school, too.
4787000	4790000	I played the clarinet and did a lot of those field shows.
4790000	4792000	And it had me thinking about that video.
4792000	4794000	And surely you all have seen this by now.
4794000	4795000	It was all over Facebook.
4795000	4798000	Even people I know that aren't that into video games were posting this.
4798000	4801000	Did you guys see that Ohio State marching band show
4801000	4804000	where they were doing the tribute to all the video games?
4804000	4805000	Surely you guys saw this.
4805000	4806000	Logan, you see this, Allen?
4806000	4807000	No.
4807000	4808000	You didn't see it?
4808000	4812000	When they did the Galloping Horse, it blew my fucking mind.
4812000	4815000	I know. It was really amazing, some of the stuff they were doing.
4815000	4818000	Now, you know, having done field shows in the past before,
4818000	4820000	and I'm sure Bobby can attest to this, too,
4820000	4822000	I'm sure we're not the only band nerds
4822000	4824000	that happen to be into video games and all that.
4824000	4827000	I'm sure there's plenty more band nerds out there listening to this show.
4827000	4830000	But it is a lot of work,
4830000	4832000	because you not only have to memorize songs,
4832000	4834000	but you have to memorize where on the field you're going.
4834000	4837000	It's not the hardest thing in the world.
4837000	4840000	I thought it was easier than memorizing lines for a stage play.
4840000	4843000	But it's challenging.
4843000	4847000	And I have even more respect for that video after seeing it.
4847000	4850000	That was an amazing little piece.
4850000	4852000	And it also made me super jealous that we didn't get to do that
4852000	4854000	when I was in high school.
4854000	4856000	Amazing.
4856000	4859000	Jessica Harper from Understation Live is in our chat room
4859000	4861000	at live.vognetwork.com and says,
4861000	4864000	I was, however, the drum major my senior year.
4864000	4867000	I feel like she's told me that before, and I forgot.
4867000	4870000	And that's awesome, because I tried out to be drum major,
4870000	4872000	but I wasn't picked.
4872000	4874000	Somebody else was picked.
4875000	4877000	I'm a drum major reject.
4877000	4881000	And now look at me. I'm on a podcast about video games on the internets.
4881000	4883000	Anyhow.
4883000	4885000	Drum major reject.
4885000	4888000	That'll be the title of my first album, Drum Major Reject.
4888000	4890000	All right.
4890000	4896000	Well, I'm glad Jessica could achieve where I clearly failed miserably.
4896000	4898000	All right.
4898000	4900000	I apologize again for my voice, you guys.
4900000	4902000	I am kind of struggling through tonight's show.
4902000	4906000	I've already had a hot cup of coffee and a throat-coat cup of tea,
4906000	4908000	and it'll fix it for about 30 seconds,
4908000	4910000	and then I go back to,
4910000	4912000	My voice has got to scratch.
4912000	4914000	So I will do my best.
4914000	4916000	This is like the worst possible thing that can happen to a radio guy,
4916000	4919000	but I will do my best to try to get through the next couple hours here,
4919000	4922000	or not next couple hours, but next hour or so,
4922000	4925000	of the show for you guys,
4925000	4927000	because we have plenty more gaming news to talk about.
4927000	4930000	And we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news, right, Loki?
4930000	4932000	That is correct.
4932000	4934000	So let's talk a little bit about this really cool sale
4934000	4936000	that they've got on Amazon right now.
4936000	4938000	It's a bunch of Square Enix games,
4938000	4940000	and I think it's a great deal.
4940000	4942000	It's 10 bucks,
4942000	4944000	and you basically get Deus Ex, Human Revolution,
4944000	4946000	Augmented Edition,
4946000	4948000	plus the Missing Link DLC, Hitman Blood Money,
4948000	4950000	Just Cause 2, Just Cause,
4950000	4952000	Quantum Conundrum, Supreme Commander 2,
4952000	4954000	and The Last Remnant.
4954000	4956000	For $10.
4956000	4959000	And the sale is running through October 20th.
4959000	4961000	It expires at
4961000	4963000	11.59 PM Pacific Standard Time,
4963000	4965000	so go get it,
4965000	4967000	because, I mean, that's
4967000	4969000	seriously a great price.
4969000	4971000	Yes, this is a sale we were referring to in Part A,
4971000	4973000	and I gotta say, kind of once, actually.
4973000	4975000	Yeah, it's called the Absolutely Great
4975000	4977000	Square Pack from Amazon.
4977000	4979000	And these are all the PC?
4979000	4981000	All PC.
4981000	4983000	Yeah, The Last Remnant, which, you know,
4983000	4985000	was their exclusive RPG for the 360,
4985000	4987000	which was a huge pile of shit,
4987000	4989000	if you have a good PC, it plays fine.
4989000	4991000	So the technical issues that it had
4991000	4993000	on the 360 are on PC,
4993000	4995000	and you should actually play that game, because it's good,
4995000	4997000	and no one would ever know, because it was so awful on the 360.
4997000	4999000	So, overlooked,
4999000	5001000	Square RPG.
5001000	5003000	Agdeft in our chatroom says,
5003000	5005000	Amazon won't let me buy it.
5005000	5007000	I wonder if that's the Mexico thing.
5007000	5009000	Maybe it's a deal that's only good in the US.
5009000	5011000	That kind of sucks for those
5011000	5013000	that are in other countries. I'm sorry.
5013000	5015000	I don't know what else to say.
5015000	5017000	It sucks.
5017000	5019000	Actually, you know what?
5019000	5021000	It may not be available anymore. It says currently unavailable.
5021000	5023000	Maybe it sold out.
5023000	5025000	Maybe so many people jumped on it.
5025000	5027000	And here's the thing, too.
5027000	5029000	The DRM on it was Steam,
5029000	5031000	so you were getting some sort of codes or something.
5031000	5033000	For a lot of games.
5033000	5035000	Oh, wait, wait.
5035000	5037000	I see it right here. Actually, no, I'm sorry.
5037000	5039000	It says unavailable, but then there is this
5039000	5041000	buy and download thing.
5041000	5043000	Let's try clicking that, just out of curiosity.
5043000	5045000	Just come on.
5051000	5053000	No, it will not let me.
5053000	5055000	During some of Steam's
5055000	5057000	really insane 99 cent sales,
5057000	5059000	this happened with GTA 4
5059000	5061000	and Ballad of Gay Tony.
5061000	5063000	They had a note.
5063000	5065000	We don't have codes.
5065000	5067000	We ran out of all our codes,
5067000	5069000	so we have to contact Rockstar Games
5069000	5071000	for 20,000 more codes.
5071000	5073000	That could be the issue that's happening here.
5073000	5075000	Well, they may have had limited copies,
5075000	5077000	and then once they hit all the blocks, then...
5077000	5079000	Well, that sucks.
5079000	5081000	AlphaCananagram in chat is saying
5081000	5083000	don't know if Loki said, but
5083000	5085000	feel free to use the code
5085000	5087000	S-Q-R-L-U-V-I-O
5087000	5089000	to take $2 off any digital video games
5089000	5091000	purchase. Code will expire
5091000	5093000	when this product becomes available for purchase again.
5093000	5095000	I wonder if that means Amazon
5095000	5097000	didn't intend for this to happen
5097000	5099000	or something weird is going on.
5099000	5101000	I don't have that code either.
5101000	5103000	Very strange.
5103000	5105000	These bastards.
5105000	5107000	Alright.
5107000	5109000	I bet you're mad for waiting now.
5109000	5111000	Check tomorrow.
5111000	5113000	Oh no, I do see that.
5113000	5115000	It says currently out of keys.
5115000	5117000	Back in stock soon. $2 promo.
5117000	5119000	There it is.
5119000	5121000	Just give it some time
5121000	5123000	and keep checking back, I guess.
5123000	5125000	Great deal.
5125000	5127000	Either way.
5127000	5129000	Either way.
5129000	5131000	Alright. And then, of course,
5131000	5133000	we have to talk a little bit about
5133000	5135000	some DLC and Sleeping Dogs.
5135000	5137000	They're going to have quite a bit of
5137000	5139000	DLC soon. Starting next week,
5139000	5141000	they're getting some
5141000	5143000	street racing DLC. It's going to add
5143000	5145000	some new street races
5145000	5147000	in the game, I guess, for $4.
5147000	5149000	That's what's going to run you.
5149000	5151000	It's going to have three new races across
5151000	5153000	land and sea. And also,
5153000	5155000	I guess, there's some new street
5155000	5157000	racer DLC that they're
5157000	5159000	I guess they're adding a new motorcycle
5159000	5161000	as well.
5161000	5163000	And a new outfit
5163000	5165000	that boosts, I guess,
5165000	5167000	defense against gunfire and accidents.
5167000	5169000	Then there's also going to be
5169000	5171000	some DLC on the
5171000	5173000	30th that's
5173000	5175000	I guess it's sort of
5175000	5177000	similar to like, they're kind of
5177000	5179000	comparing it to Undead Nightmare for
5179000	5181000	I don't know if there's zombies in it or not, but
5181000	5183000	it's supposed to kind of tie in
5183000	5185000	with Hong Kong Cinema.
5185000	5187000	I guess the beginning, it's Nightmare
5187000	5189000	in Northport.
5189000	5191000	And it'll be some
5191000	5193000	horror-themed thing that says
5193000	5195000	with the DLC we can
5195000	5197000	explore other aspects of Hong
5197000	5199000	Kong Cinema.
5199000	5201000	So, no idea what exactly
5201000	5203000	that is or how much it's going to cost,
5203000	5205000	but that's going to actually be story DLC
5205000	5207000	that's going to be coming pretty soon.
5207000	5209000	And last but not least,
5209000	5211000	DLC for Borderlands,
5211000	5213000	which by the way, if you haven't heard
5213000	5215000	yet, that free DLC
5215000	5217000	that if you bought the, or pre-ordered
5217000	5219000	the game and you got the premier club or whatever,
5219000	5221000	they actually released the
5221000	5223000	extra character class early.
5223000	5225000	So that came out last week, so that's
5225000	5227000	pretty awesome.
5227000	5229000	Another game I really need to go back and play some more.
5229000	5231000	But first piece of DLC
5231000	5233000	coming on the 16th,
5233000	5235000	so this Tuesday, it's Captain Scarlet
5235000	5237000	and Her Pirate's Booty.
5237000	5239000	And that's coming for
5239000	5241000	10 bucks,
5241000	5243000	or if you want, you can buy a season pass
5243000	5245000	for 30 bucks and you get four pieces
5245000	5247000	of DLC, so, you know, 25%
5247000	5249000	off. And really,
5249000	5251000	I mean, if you played the Borderlands 1
5251000	5253000	and played all the DLC in it,
5253000	5255000	you know it's going to be good. So,
5255000	5257000	I'm sure that
5257000	5259000	the DLC will be pretty awesome. I'm still waiting
5259000	5261000	to hear on
5261000	5263000	how it goes and maybe I'll have to
5263000	5265000	plunk down the 30 bucks for a season pass.
5265000	5267000	Alright.
5267000	5269000	Well, going into
5269000	5271000	news on a game that I really should
5271000	5273000	check out at some point because I did love
5273000	5275000	the old series and I hear it is kind of
5275000	5277000	a, you know, newer version of that.
5277000	5279000	I just haven't had the time this week to
5279000	5281000	pick it up, but it is XCOM
5281000	5283000	Enemy Unknown. The revival
5283000	5285000	of XCOM. Well, there's a pretty nifty
5285000	5287000	Easter egg in the game that allows you to bring
5287000	5289000	in super soldiers. You can
5289000	5291000	put in certain names and they
5291000	5293000	activate XCOM Heroes.
5293000	5295000	I don't know, for some reason it makes me think of
5295000	5297000	NBA Jam when you could put
5297000	5299000	in certain combinations that would unlock
5299000	5301000	Bill Clinton and Scorpion
5301000	5303000	and shit. That was awesome.
5303000	5305000	So, I don't know. But here's the type
5305000	5307000	of people you can unlock here.
5307000	5309000	Sid Meier.
5309000	5311000	Ken Levine. I think
5311000	5313000	that's awesome that they put Sid Meier in there.
5313000	5315000	Joe Kelly and Otto
5315000	5317000	Zander are apparently all super soldiers
5317000	5319000	so far.
5319000	5321000	Apparently the one little trick to it
5321000	5323000	is that once you summon the heroes,
5323000	5325000	the achievements are turned off.
5325000	5327000	So if you want to go for achievements
5327000	5329000	don't use this little cheat.
5329000	5331000	But maybe once you've beat the game
5331000	5333000	and got the achievements you want, go back
5333000	5335000	and play as Sid Meier. For the lolz!
5335000	5337000	Moving on
5337000	5339000	to a Street Fighter movie
5339000	5341000	that apparently is not being made
5341000	5343000	in Japan.
5343000	5345000	This is a Brazilian
5345000	5347000	artist. That's pretty cool. Victor Hugo.
5347000	5349000	He's a real big fan of
5349000	5351000	Street Fighter and he wants to do
5351000	5353000	this movie that he calls somewhere
5353000	5355000	between next gen fighting game and Hollywood
5355000	5357000	animated movie.
5357000	5359000	He's teamed up with an animator friend to make
5359000	5361000	Street Fighter 3.
5361000	5363000	It's a fan flick
5363000	5365000	and it looks really, really
5365000	5367000	nice. Especially in these little
5367000	5369000	posters. It looks even better
5369000	5371000	than like
5371000	5373000	Frankenweenie or one of those movies that's
5373000	5375000	in theaters. It's a really neat art style.
5375000	5377000	Kind of impressive that it's
5377000	5379000	only these two guys.
5379000	5381000	Even more impressive that Capcom hasn't
5381000	5383000	shut it down yet but maybe the fact that they are
5383000	5385000	in Brazil makes it complicated.
5385000	5387000	Good luck to them.
5387000	5389000	I really would not have
5389000	5391000	brought this up because I hate giving this
5391000	5393000	attention but it is a slow news week
5393000	5395000	so I will quickly say
5395000	5397000	PETA put out their little spoofs this
5397000	5399000	week of Pokemon Black 2
5399000	5401000	and White 2. It was a little spoof
5401000	5403000	game that they put out. Here's their statement.
5403000	5405000	Enjoy this
5405000	5407000	from PETA.
5407000	5409000	Much like animals in the real world
5409000	5411000	Pokemon are treated as unfeeling objects
5411000	5413000	and used for things as human entertainment
5413000	5415000	and as subjects in experiments.
5415000	5417000	The way the Pokemon are stuffed
5417000	5419000	into Pokeballs is similar to how
5419000	5421000	circuses chain elephants inside railroad cars
5421000	5423000	and let them out only to perform
5423000	5425000	confusing and awful painful tricks that
5425000	5427000	were taught using sharp steel tipped
5427000	5429000	bull hooks and electric shock prods.
5429000	5431000	If PETA existed in Unova
5431000	5433000	our motto would be
5433000	5435000	Pokemon are not ours to use or abuse.
5435000	5437000	They exist for their own reasons.
5437000	5439000	We believe that this is the message that should be
5439000	5441000	sent to children.
5441000	5443000	Now Pika Pii!
5443000	5445000	I just want to remind
5445000	5447000	you guys PETA is clearly trolling
5447000	5449000	with this. Look at that statement.
5449000	5451000	Over half of the
5451000	5453000	statement had nothing to do with the
5453000	5455000	game they were putting out. They used
5455000	5457000	half that statement to talk about the whole
5457000	5459000	circus and the elephants and all that
5459000	5461000	stuff. It is all about
5461000	5463000	attention. I mean clearly
5463000	5465000	they play Pokemon.
5465000	5467000	They understand Pokemon because they know
5467000	5469000	about like the Pokemon world.
5469000	5471000	They said if PETA existed in Unova
5471000	5473000	they didn't say if PETA existed
5473000	5475000	in the Pokemon universe or if PETA
5475000	5477000	ruled Nintendo. These people
5477000	5479000	know what the fuck they're doing by getting
5479000	5481000	attention. Congratulations.
5481000	5483000	You picked the right
5483000	5485000	week to do it at least if nothing else.
5485000	5487000	Alan. I
5487000	5489000	played PETA's Cooking Mama game
5489000	5491000	from Thanksgiving and
5491000	5493000	whoever they contract to do their
5493000	5495000	Shockwave games, some of them are actually
5495000	5497000	kind of good. That almost
5497000	5499000	is the reason why these things are worth
5499000	5501000	covering because as much as they are
5501000	5503000	trolly and it's like
5503000	5505000	you just roll your eyes at PETA
5505000	5507000	they are really
5507000	5509000	high quality trolls.
5509000	5511000	Yeah, because the Cooking Mama
5511000	5513000	one was how to make a Tofurky
5513000	5515000	in the vegan Thanksgiving.
5515000	5517000	You click and drag the food ingredients. I'm like
5517000	5519000	this is a pretty well done little Shockwave
5519000	5521000	game.
5521000	5523000	Do you
5523000	5525000	remember playing on the Genesis ToeJam & Earl?
5525000	5527000	Because I do.
5527000	5529000	The sequel ToeJam & Earl and Panic
5529000	5531000	on Funkotron are going to hit
5531000	5533000	the PSN and
5533000	5535000	XBLA online stores on November
5535000	5537000	6th and 7th respectively.
5537000	5539000	I never played this because
5539000	5541000	at the time I was at the age where
5541000	5543000	I was really kind of butthurt.
5543000	5545000	It's basically
5545000	5547000	a 2D side scrolling platformer
5547000	5549000	and the original ToeJam & Earl
5549000	5551000	was like an overhead sort of adventure
5551000	5553000	game.
5553000	5555000	So yeah, if you're a fan of ToeJam & Earl
5555000	5557000	and want some vintage Genesis
5557000	5559000	nostalgia, pick that up November 6th
5559000	5561000	and 7th.
5561000	5563000	God of War Ascension
5563000	5565000	which is the next God of War game because you know
5565000	5567000	they're not going to let that franchise die off.
5567000	5569000	The demo is going to be in the Total
5569000	5571000	Recall remake.
5571000	5573000	The one with Colin, whatever his name is.
5573000	5579000	That comes out on
5579000	5581000	December 18th.
5581000	5583000	So get the Total Recall
5583000	5585000	Blu-ray, play God of War Ascension
5585000	5587000	and that is going to be the only way to get
5587000	5589000	that demo until four days before
5589000	5591000	the game comes out. I think like March
5591000	5593000	8th is when they're
5593000	5595000	putting the demo on PSN and then the game comes out
5595000	5597000	on March 12th of next year.
5597000	5599000	And the graphics for it, just looking at these screenshots
5599000	5601000	look really like
5601000	5603000	disgustingly awesome.
5603000	5605000	Very God of War-ish.
5605000	5607000	Finally
5607000	5609000	the game Injustice
5609000	5611000	Gods Among Us which I will admit I don't really know
5611000	5613000	much about. It's being put
5613000	5615000	out by NetherRealm. They are
5615000	5617000	has a DC Comics character
5617000	5619000	in it. It's going to be Green Arrow.
5619000	5621000	Who some people might remember like you know the show
5621000	5623000	Supernatural which finally ended after like
5623000	5625000	11 seasons that had Green Arrow in it.
5625000	5627000	It's the Green Arrow I think is
5627000	5629000	best known. Wait, Supernatural's not done.
5629000	5631000	Still on the air, isn't it? Oh, I meant Smallville.
5631000	5633000	I'm sorry, Smallville Superman.
5633000	5635000	And now there's an Arrow series
5635000	5637000	on CW that like just either it
5637000	5639000	just started last week or it's starting this week.
5639000	5641000	Oh, is it a spin-off of the same actor? Yeah, I think
5641000	5643000	they're trying to make Smallville Lightning Strike twice.
5643000	5645000	Yeah.
5645000	5647000	So yeah, Green Arrow is going to be
5647000	5649000	a character in Injustice Gods Among Us.
5649000	5651000	There you go.
5651000	5653000	Yeah, and it's the
5653000	5655000	Justice League outfit I believe from
5655000	5657000	the Cartoon Network show. Shane
5657000	5659000	in chat says, different actor sadly.
5659000	5661000	Oh, well that's just
5661000	5663000	unfortunate.
5663000	5665000	Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat, I want to go back
5665000	5667000	to the PETA thing for a minute. Remember, they're delayed
5667000	5669000	so sometimes it takes time for them to comment on things.
5669000	5671000	Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder what
5671000	5673000	PETA thinks of Tokyo Jungle.
5673000	5675000	Wouldn't they hate the fact that you play
5675000	5677000	as animals eating other animals?
5677000	5679000	Again, this is
5679000	5681000	proof that they're trolling because
5681000	5683000	you know obviously Tokyo Jungle
5683000	5685000	is the game to take issue with but they know
5685000	5687000	that Tokyo Jungle is a niche thing.
5687000	5689000	No one curr about Tokyo Jungle.
5689000	5691000	But what's a game that everybody talks about?
5691000	5693000	Pokemon. Anyway, I'm giving
5693000	5695000	this story far too much attention. I just wanted to
5695000	5697000	address that comment because it was worth
5697000	5699000	commenting on. I don't think they really have a problem with
5699000	5701000	people or with animals eating other
5701000	5703000	animals because that just happens in the wild but
5703000	5705000	as long as it's not people eating
5705000	5707000	other animals, that's really the issue
5707000	5709000	there. So by that logic,
5709000	5711000	would they be okay with
5711000	5713000	people eating other people?
5713000	5715000	Yes.
5715000	5717000	Because they're only for the
5717000	5719000	ethical treatment of animals. Nothing about
5719000	5721000	people. Oh, okay.
5721000	5723000	Just wanted to make sure that was clear.
5723000	5725000	Unfortunately,
5725000	5727000	doesn't exist. Well, you know, we need a people
5727000	5729000	for the ethical treatment of people.
5729000	5731000	That's what we need. That's the foundation we really
5731000	5733000	well, I sound like such an asshole
5733000	5735000	because it sounds like I'm saying fuck animals
5735000	5737000	and that's not really what I'm saying.
5737000	5739000	But I think we should
5739000	5741000	have a, you know,
5741000	5743000	what about how we treat each other? Isn't
5743000	5745000	that important as well?
5745000	5747000	Anyhow.
5747000	5749000	Again, giving it far too much credit.
5749000	5751000	You know what deserves more credit on our show?
5751000	5753000	Our Facebook and Google
5753000	5755000	Plus fan communities.
5755000	5757000	It's the Fugal
5757000	5759000	Question of the Week. Take Facebook and Google
5759000	5761000	and put it together and you get Fugal.
5761000	5763000	And the Question of the
5763000	5765000	Week this week.
5765000	5767000	Kind of a little
5767000	5769000	play on the fact that I've been on vacation
5769000	5771000	for a little bit.
5771000	5773000	Everybody's done it at some point in their life or another.
5773000	5775000	What is the worst thing you've
5775000	5777000	missed in real life so you
5777000	5779000	can stay at home and play a video game?
5779000	5781000	Did work get in the way of a Final Fantasy
5781000	5783000	launch? Did you stay at home
5783000	5785000	to raid on World of Warcraft instead
5785000	5787000	of going to your friend's birthday party?
5787000	5789000	Excuse me. Pick up.
5789000	5791000	Bad time.
5791000	5793000	Worst nightmare for a radio person.
5793000	5795000	Did you stay home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of
5795000	5797000	going to your friend's birthday party?
5797000	5799000	Let's go to some of the answers on Google.
5799000	5801000	Starting with actdeft. I don't recall
5801000	5803000	missing anything serious for a video game.
5803000	5805000	I have come close though. Like
5805000	5807000	almost missing class to get a Dreamcast
5807000	5809000	on Black Friday. Remember I'm from
5809000	5811000	Mexico and we don't have Thanksgiving here.
5811000	5813000	I think the most serious one was when I
5813000	5815000	offered to help in a DDR tournament the same
5815000	5817000	day I had agreed to help some friends with
5817000	5819000	a political party's elections.
5819000	5821000	But forgot they were the same day.
5821000	5823000	Since I'd agreed to the former first, my friends
5823000	5825000	didn't mind and let me go to the tourney though.
5825000	5827000	So no harm done.
5827000	5829000	Sean F. replied on Google Plus.
5829000	5831000	Yes, there are people on Google Plus.
5831000	5833000	I have to say that every week.
5833000	5835000	And said I wish I had
5835000	5837000	a terrible secret to reveal. But I think
5837000	5839000	the worst I ever did was I took the day off
5839000	5841000	in 2005 when I got a PSP
5841000	5843000	at midnight release. Wipe out
5843000	5845000	pure and luminous. Good times.
5845000	5847000	Indeed
5847000	5849000	good times. Let's
5849000	5851000	go to Facebook and get some answers
5851000	5853000	to the question there in our Facebook community.
5853000	5855000	Starting off with
5857000	5859000	Where'd the post go? Here it is.
5859000	5861000	Critical Myth says
5861000	5863000	I've been far more likely to miss things like
5863000	5865000	company Christmas parties to see
5865000	5867000	Lord of the Rings premieres.
5867000	5869000	But a friend of mine skipped his own
5869000	5871000	performance review to stand
5871000	5873000	in line for the 360.
5873000	5875000	He still got promoted.
5875000	5877000	Skipped his performance
5877000	5879000	review at work to get a 360.
5879000	5881000	That's a pretty good one. He must have known
5881000	5883000	he was going to get a good review and could get away with murder
5883000	5885000	with his boss.
5885000	5887000	Degenerated Johnny says
5887000	5889000	I was leading my first raid in
5889000	5891000	Molten Core during Vanilla WoW.
5891000	5893000	Unfortunately the raid was during the time
5893000	5895000	I was supposed to pick my mother up from
5895000	5897000	the airport. She was coming
5897000	5899000	back from a trip to her homeland of
5899000	5901000	Scotland. This resulted with her
5901000	5903000	being stuck at the airport for two
5903000	5905000	hours. As punishment
5905000	5907000	I had to act the role of being her
5907000	5909000	personal chauffeur for an entire
5909000	5911000	month. It wasn't all bad. It allowed
5911000	5913000	us to have some good times with each other.
5913000	5915000	This proves that sometimes gaming
5915000	5917000	experiences can help push families
5917000	5919000	closer together.
5921000	5923000	Even if it was through force, right?
5923000	5925000	Haseo Sumeru
5925000	5927000	Excuse me, sorry
5927000	5929000	guys, the voice is going. Haseo Sumeru
5929000	5931000	says it's funny that you
5931000	5933000	mentioned the Final Fantasy launch thing because way
5933000	5935000	back when I first started playing Final Fantasy
5935000	5937000	X, I faked getting sick
5937000	5939000	so I could stay home from school.
5939000	5941000	I went all out, had a heater
5941000	5943000	in my room, aimed at my face to fake
5943000	5945000	the fever and water bottle with ice water
5945000	5947000	for cold sweat. And it was worth
5947000	5949000	it because I managed to make my way through the
5949000	5951000	Zanarkand ruins all the way up to the final
5951000	5953000	fight, I think.
5953000	5955000	Dark Tetsuya says I actually skipped school
5955000	5957000	the day I got the original PlayStation.
5957000	5959000	Ironically ran into my high school
5959000	5961000	tutor at the time who didn't seem to mind.
5961000	5963000	Yes, I did graduate.
5963000	5965000	And lastly, Chiggers on Facebook
5965000	5967000	says, never happened.
5967000	5969000	In real life is always
5969000	5971000	more important than a game. The game will
5971000	5973000	always be there, but real life
5973000	5975000	experience only happens once.
5975000	5977000	Oh, you.
5977000	5979000	What a party pooper answer.
5979000	5981000	I'm just kidding.
5981000	5983000	That's something we probably should remember.
5983000	5985000	Anybody in here with a story to
5985000	5987000	share? What's the worst thing you skipped out on in real
5987000	5989000	life to play a video game? Allen?
5989000	5991000	Um...
5991000	5993000	I did some
5993000	5995000	all-nighters when I was in high school
5995000	5997000	where I just didn't go to bed. I just
5997000	5999000	played a game and then when it was time to go to school, I went to school
5999000	6001000	because when you're 16, 17, you can do
6001000	6003000	that shit. Your body's like, fine, I'll be up
6003000	6005000	for, you know, 36
6005000	6007000	hours until eventually you can crash.
6007000	6009000	But as far as missing,
6009000	6011000	I mean, I
6011000	6013000	when the PS2 came out,
6013000	6015000	I got up, I went to bed at like
6015000	6017000	eight in the evening, got
6017000	6019000	up at one or two in the morning,
6019000	6021000	walked, I think, two or three
6021000	6023000	miles to Target, got in line
6023000	6025000	at Target at like 4 AM.
6025000	6027000	There was
6027000	6029000	already a line. I got PS2
6029000	6031000	I think 38 out of 43
6031000	6033000	so my timing couldn't have been any more
6033000	6035000	flawless from wanting
6035000	6037000	to actually avoid camping the
6037000	6039000	entire night out. And then I went
6039000	6041000	into work. Once I actually
6041000	6043000	bought the thing, I think I was in the office by, I want
6043000	6045000	to say 10 or 11 in the morning, but I already cleared it with
6045000	6047000	my boss the night before, so...
6047000	6049000	I've never been
6049000	6051000	I've never done anything that scandalous.
6051000	6053000	I've never, I don't really think I've
6053000	6055000	taken a, have I taken a day off work
6055000	6057000	to play a game?
6057000	6059000	I don't, I, if I did, I honestly do
6059000	6061000	not remember. I took a day
6061000	6063000	off work to play World of Warcraft.
6063000	6065000	Yeah, because Pandaria, that used to be, yeah. But
6065000	6067000	to be fair, I ended up having a Disneyland
6067000	6069000	trip and I would have taken the day off anyway.
6069000	6071000	True. So,
6071000	6073000	but the, I guess my
6073000	6075000	real answer would be that I cut
6075000	6077000	a lot of class in
6077000	6079000	college to play Final Fantasy 7.
6079000	6081000	It was real
6081000	6083000	good and I was really into it, okay? I was more
6083000	6085000	into it than some of my classes I had at the time.
6085000	6087000	You weren't really into college that much anyway.
6087000	6089000	I really wasn't, so I, I skipped
6089000	6091000	a lot. I probably cut class
6091000	6093000	to stay home and play Puzzle Fighter 2
6093000	6095000	with friends, so, or
6095000	6097000	excuse me, Super Puzzle Fighter 2
6097000	6099000	Turbo or whatever it was called. I probably
6099000	6101000	cut class to stay home and play that with friends and it
6101000	6103000	was worth it, I don't care. Low-key.
6103000	6105000	Um, I
6105000	6107000	skipped work, well I took time off
6107000	6109000	for, um,
6109000	6111000	Grand Theft Auto, well, recently
6111000	6113000	it was, well actually it wasn't that recent, but
6113000	6115000	Grand Theft Auto 4, to try to
6115000	6117000	get 100% on everything so I could get the keys
6117000	6119000	to the city, which I technically
6119000	6121000	did within the time frame that they had
6121000	6123000	in the whole contest thing, but
6123000	6125000	they only had a limited amount of keys and it wasn't
6125000	6127000	registering the information correctly. There was a
6127000	6129000	huge delay, so, I unfortunately
6129000	6131000	didn't get the keys to the city, but
6131000	6133000	um,
6133000	6135000	got the achievement for 100% though.
6135000	6137000	I took time off work when Final Fantasy
6137000	6139000	11 came out. I remember
6139000	6141000	that, I was so jazzed for that game,
6141000	6143000	I totally took the day off when that came out too.
6143000	6145000	That was years ago.
6145000	6147000	I didn't skip work, I just took the day off.
6147000	6149000	So I guess it's not as
6149000	6151000	bad if you planned it in advance, right?
6151000	6153000	I'd probably take the day off work for Grand Theft Auto 5.
6153000	6155000	In the future.
6155000	6157000	In the future, planning for 2013.
6157000	6159000	Alright, we have some more news stories
6159000	6161000	for you guys, and then we'll get your
6161000	6163000	Skype calls here in a little bit.
6163000	6165000	Alright, so there's this
6165000	6167000	new patent from Sony for
6167000	6169000	a controller.
6169000	6171000	Right now, at least in the diagram, it shows
6171000	6173000	a Playstation Move controller, but apparently
6173000	6175000	it's a controller that allows
6175000	6177000	the user to feel
6177000	6179000	temperature change. So,
6179000	6181000	for example, the controller could get
6181000	6183000	hotter, like if your
6183000	6185000	gun overheats, or you get hit by
6185000	6187000	a fireball, or you're in an area where there's
6187000	6189000	fire, or something like that. Or,
6189000	6191000	if you're in a
6191000	6193000	icy area or something.
6193000	6195000	It's kind of like a temperature
6195000	6197000	feedback, as well as how they have
6197000	6199000	the force feedback and stuff.
6199000	6201000	So, neat!
6201000	6203000	I don't know if it's necessarily something that
6203000	6205000	they're going to be
6205000	6207000	implementing into a Move controller or something
6207000	6209000	like that soon, but
6209000	6211000	it's kind of cool to have this technology
6211000	6213000	around for whenever you may
6213000	6215000	use it in the future,
6215000	6217000	for some new controller or something.
6217000	6219000	I don't know if it'd be a big deal,
6219000	6221000	like, you know, a controller got cold
6221000	6223000	and went into an icy area. It'd be kind of,
6223000	6225000	haha, that's neat! I'd like to
6225000	6227000	leave it cold all the time, you know.
6227000	6229000	Sometimes your hands get sweaty.
6229000	6231000	Maybe it should detect whether your hands are sweaty, and then
6231000	6233000	cool off. There's a third-party
6233000	6235000	company idea right there.
6235000	6237000	If Playstation
6237000	6239000	had indie games,
6239000	6241000	somebody would release an indie game that's called
6241000	6243000	Hand Warmer.
6243000	6245000	And then the
6245000	6247000	sequel, Hand Freezer.
6247000	6249000	You know who needs this technology?
6249000	6251000	Microsoft for the Xbox 360.
6251000	6253000	Why?
6253000	6255000	When it detects it's getting hot, it gets colder.
6255000	6257000	So the system doesn't crash.
6257000	6259000	Oh, okay.
6259000	6261000	I see what you did there. That's good.
6261000	6263000	It's just water-cool everything. I don't know.
6263000	6265000	Well, it wouldn't be hard for the Playstation controller
6265000	6267000	to get hot. They could just put in there whatever
6267000	6269000	they put in iPhones,
6269000	6271000	because the iPhones get really hot if you're, like,
6271000	6273000	using it too much.
6273000	6275000	When it's really straining
6275000	6277000	for a signal, I notice it gets really hot.
6277000	6279000	That's how they could do it.
6281000	6283000	Maybe they could
6283000	6285000	implement this into the iPhone.
6285000	6287000	You know, when you piss off Siri
6287000	6289000	by asking a bunch of stupid questions, it'll just
6289000	6291000	melt down into your hand.
6291000	6293000	You'll just...
6293000	6295000	I'm gonna burn your hand now!
6295000	6297000	Wrong answer.
6297000	6299000	Punishing games.
6299000	6301000	Kinda... dumb.
6303000	6305000	This would be something that you'd add to, like,
6305000	6307000	haptics later on, but let's get the haptics
6307000	6309000	thing out of the way first, you know.
6309000	6311000	I think more people would be interested in
6311000	6313000	touching things rather than, ooh, it's cold now.
6315000	6317000	First off, actually, challenge number one.
6317000	6319000	Getting people to buy the move.
6319000	6321000	That's challenge number one.
6321000	6323000	Challenge two, implementing, you know, temperature
6323000	6325000	change in there, and having people
6325000	6327000	be interested. And seriously, how is temperature
6327000	6329000	change gonna come in handy in, like,
6329000	6331000	Just Dance 4, or, like,
6331000	6333000	I don't know, Archery
6333000	6335000	in Sports Champions, or...
6335000	6337000	Maybe this is why the last Guardian got
6337000	6339000	delayed. Maybe he's guarding temperature.
6341000	6343000	I don't know.
6343000	6345000	Maybe it's because it's gonna be a launch
6345000	6347000	in another system or something.
6347000	6349000	Alright. Or maybe it's nothing.
6349000	6351000	Maybe it's just somebody
6351000	6353000	had the idea and it was like, you know what,
6353000	6355000	let's patent it just in case Nintendo's thinking of something.
6357000	6359000	Well, this is an interesting
6359000	6361000	little rumor that's going around.
6361000	6363000	Take it with a grain of salt, because it's
6363000	6365000	spawned from a NeoGaf post, but
6365000	6367000	you never know. Sometimes where there's smoke,
6367000	6369000	there's fire. Sometimes.
6369000	6371000	Rumor is,
6371000	6373000	Shigeru Miyamoto is expected
6373000	6375000	to leave Nintendo's EAD division
6375000	6377000	by December. How many times has his
6377000	6379000	rumor been around? I mean, seriously, there was
6379000	6381000	another rumor that he, this was like a couple
6381000	6383000	months ago, that it was the same
6383000	6385000	damn thing. Apparently, Miyamoto is not
6385000	6387000	happy, because the EAD
6387000	6389000	general manager overshadows the
6389000	6391000	content that's created by new producers
6391000	6393000	and directors at Nintendo's largest gaming division.
6393000	6395000	New Super Mario
6395000	6397000	Bros. producer Takashi
6397000	6399000	Tezuka is rumored to take his place.
6399000	6401000	Other changes,
6401000	6403000	boy, where
6403000	6405000	I said there's smoke, there's fire.
6405000	6407000	Where there's wank, there's a lot of wank.
6407000	6409000	A major
6409000	6411000	shift in Kyoto development sources
6411000	6413000	involving three research and development
6413000	6415000	buildings.
6415000	6417000	New groups and new producers being
6417000	6419000	announced for EAD Kyoto and
6419000	6421000	SPD Kyoto. A Tokyo
6421000	6423000	expansion of EAD and
6423000	6425000	Mashihiro Sakurai possibly
6425000	6427000	joining EAD Tokyo.
6427000	6429000	New division led by
6429000	6431000	Miyamoto with younger staff
6431000	6433000	focused on smaller scale games.
6433000	6435000	Miyamoto's
6435000	6437000	departure inspiring new IPs
6437000	6439000	for the EAD Kyoto division.
6439000	6441000	And Cliffy B
6441000	6443000	going to EAD Tokyo.
6443000	6445000	I added the last one myself.
6445000	6447000	I added that one myself.
6447000	6449000	Come on.
6449000	6451000	I had to throw my own wank on there too.
6451000	6453000	Why not? Everybody else is.
6453000	6455000	Maybe that's a list list.
6455000	6457000	Nintendo
6457000	6459000	wank. Best Nintendo wank.
6459000	6461000	Come on. Let's make up a Nintendo rumor.
6461000	6463000	Come on. Come on, Alan. Make up a Nintendo rumor.
6465000	6467000	Total legit source. Come on.
6467000	6469000	Wii U
6469000	6471000	will use points
6471000	6473000	like XBLA
6473000	6475000	and have DRM.
6477000	6479000	Yes, it probably will because
6479000	6481000	there's this thing called Wii points that already
6481000	6483000	exist. I know you've never played a Wii.
6483000	6485000	Come on, Loki.
6489000	6491000	Add your own Nintendo wank. It's fun.
6491000	6493000	Nintendo wank. Let's see.
6497000	6499000	I
6499000	6501000	don't know. This is tough.
6501000	6503000	It's tough to come up with something stupid.
6503000	6505000	People pull this shit out of their ass all day
6505000	6507000	long. I know, but I have to be
6507000	6509000	selective when I pull out of my ass to make it
6509000	6511000	sound a little bit more legitimate than the other people
6511000	6513000	that pull stuff out of their asses.
6513000	6515000	That's the thing. That's why I was giving it some thought there.
6515000	6517000	So, Loki, the man who works
6517000	6519000	for the distributor, what is Nintendo going to do
6519000	6521000	next? What are you posting to me after tomorrow?
6521000	6523000	They're going to fake another shortage on the goddamn Wii U
6523000	6525000	system to create an artificial demand.
6525000	6527000	That's not a rumor.
6527000	6529000	Oh, no.
6529000	6531000	Did you hear what? No, this actually didn't make our show
6531000	6533000	but did you hear what their fucking excuse was? There was a
6533000	6535000	fire in a production plant, I guess, that lowered
6535000	6537000	their amount of units that they're going to put out by
6537000	6539000	a million or something. Isn't that the same excuse they used
6539000	6541000	for the gasoline prices going up?
6541000	6543000	Yeah, there was a fire in a production plant.
6543000	6545000	Goddamn, Wii U's were there. Why did we store them
6545000	6547000	next to the oil?
6547000	6549000	AlphaCananagram in chat wants
6549000	6551000	to remind me they did get rid of the points
6551000	6553000	because the Nintendo 3DS eShop
6553000	6555000	does use regular money for currency.
6555000	6557000	Yeah, they got rid of those cards.
6557000	6559000	Whatever. You know what they're going to do?
6559000	6561000	I have a Nintendo rumor. Okay, yes, thank you.
6561000	6563000	Their online integration is going to be really mediocre.
6565000	6567000	These aren't rumors!
6567000	6569000	3DS Micro.
6569000	6571000	It's small enough to fit in your pocket, man.
6573000	6575000	And to take inspiration from Apple,
6575000	6577000	they're going to make their next 3DS
6577000	6579000	super wide so they can have yet
6579000	6581000	another attachment for the stupid
6581000	6583000	Have you seen the... was it the LL and the XL?
6583000	6585000	Have you seen the...
6585000	6587000	I was like, okay, okay, we made it bigger.
6587000	6589000	We could have put a thumb pad here, but no.
6589000	6591000	We're going to have an even larger thing that's going to attach to it
6591000	6593000	and make it even wider than it was.
6593000	6595000	Is that really happening?
6595000	6597000	Yes, it's really happening.
6597000	6599000	Is it out yet?
6599000	6601000	I think it's coming out in Japan if it's not out already.
6601000	6603000	It's very soon. They have pictures of it.
6603000	6605000	And it's not Photoshop. It's like, this is an official thing
6605000	6607000	because, you know, you want the larger...
6607000	6609000	I mean, seriously, it's just...
6609000	6611000	Let me just add another, like,
6611000	6613000	half of a laptop right here
6613000	6615000	and I'll put just a giant, like, analog...
6615000	6617000	I should do that. You know, make a project.
6617000	6619000	I have this analog stick that's just, like, the size of my hand.
6619000	6621000	It'll look like that Tetris game
6621000	6623000	at Golf Land with the gigantic
6623000	6625000	joystick that you use to move the pieces.
6625000	6627000	Have you seen that? The Sega Tetris?
6627000	6629000	I'm surprised no one's actually sold one of those.
6629000	6631000	It's like a, you know, home thing.
6631000	6633000	Could be fun.
6633000	6635000	It could be fun.
6635000	6637000	Alright.
6637000	6639000	Let's move on. Alan, do you have some legitimate news for us?
6639000	6641000	Kickstarter.
6641000	6643000	Everyone's favorite controversial crowdsource.
6643000	6645000	I said legitimate.
6645000	6647000	It's going
6647000	6649000	live in the UK on
6649000	6651000	Halloween. It's gonna be a part of the same
6651000	6653000	site. There is not going to be some,
6653000	6655000	you know, Kickstarter-UK.com.
6655000	6657000	It's just Kickstarter.
6657000	6659000	But if you're within the UK, you can now,
6659000	6661000	you know, put up your project.
6661000	6663000	Obviously, the
6663000	6665000	currency available is going to be
6665000	6667000	listed in pounds. Doesn't say anything
6667000	6669000	about euros here.
6669000	6671000	Yeah, you can set your goal and your stretch goals
6671000	6673000	and I imagine if you're in the US and you
6673000	6675000	want, you see something awesome over in the UK,
6675000	6677000	you can bid on it like you can
6677000	6679000	in any other Kickstarter. But, yeah, they got the
6679000	6681000	payment and the
6681000	6683000	those sketchy, you know, legal financial
6683000	6685000	stuff sorted out. So, yay, UK, you're
6685000	6687000	getting Kickstarter. I'm sure they're all very excited.
6689000	6691000	That's all. That's all I got.
6691000	6693000	There you go.
6693000	6695000	I guess they got their legal
6695000	6697000	stuff worked out, but there was already, you
6697000	6699000	know, the other. So, whatever.
6701000	6703000	Have fun getting addicted to Kickstarter
6703000	6705000	or hating on it or whatever
6705000	6707000	side of the fence you choose to be on.
6707000	6709000	As diverse as we are on this show.
6709000	6711000	Have fun with that, UK.
6711000	6713000	It's a borderland, so a lot of copies.
6713000	6715000	How many copies? Oh, shit.
6715000	6717000	1.4 million copies. That's a lot of copies.
6717000	6719000	That's a success. 60 bucks
6719000	6721000	a pop. That's a lot of money.
6721000	6723000	Exactly. And, of course, you know, also
6723000	6725000	that, um, I believe it sold
6725000	6727000	I can't remember what percent more than
6727000	6729000	234% more than the first game.
6729000	6731000	So, at launch,
6731000	6733000	that's pretty awesome. Not
6733000	6735000	so awesome, NBA Baller
6735000	6737000	Beats, which sold 3,000 copies.
6739000	6741000	Total. Wait a minute. You mean
6741000	6743000	there wasn't a market for basketball
6743000	6745000	and music fusion games?
6745000	6747000	Basketball, yeah, exactly.
6747000	6749000	Basketball, you know, it's a Kinect
6749000	6751000	game that requires you to have a floor
6751000	6753000	that's, you know, that you're not in an apartment
6753000	6755000	and that the floor is, like, hardwood
6755000	6757000	or something. Here's the ironic
6757000	6759000	twist. Now it's a collector's item
6759000	6761000	when it sells that few copies.
6761000	6763000	No, it's not.
6763000	6765000	That's like saying
6765000	6767000	that the eye of judgment is a collector's item.
6767000	6769000	It's not. It kinda is, in a way.
6769000	6771000	The, uh, Borderlands, that
6771000	6773000	is only hard copies
6773000	6775000	of the game. I think this is saying, uh,
6775000	6777000	digital distribution is not in that figure at
6777000	6779000	all, so that's even more awesome for them.
6779000	6781000	Yeah, that's awesome. Unfortunately, the digital version
6781000	6783000	of NBA Baller Beats doesn't exist, so
6783000	6785000	I can't use that to inflate
6785000	6787000	the numbers there. Bobby Lackwolf in our chat room
6787000	6789000	at live.vognetwork.com wants to
6789000	6791000	remind us NBA Baller Beats had 50,000
6791000	6793000	Twitter followers. Remember that whole thing?
6793000	6795000	So how did they only sell 3,000
6795000	6797000	copies of the game with 50,000 Twitter
6797000	6799000	followers? It was... Do you mean to tell me
6799000	6801000	they had fake Twitter followers? It wasn't
6801000	6803000	50,000. It was 500,000
6803000	6805000	Twitter followers.
6805000	6807000	Yeah, it was 500,000 because I think they
6807000	6809000	have 100,000 for, like, Call of Duty
6809000	6811000	Black Ops 2 or something
6811000	6813000	like that. Yes, they bought their
6813000	6815000	Twitter followers. Wait, wait,
6815000	6817000	wait, wait, wait.
6817000	6819000	You mean to tell me
6819000	6821000	that they bought
6821000	6823000	all those Twitter followers?
6823000	6825000	Yes, they did. There was an article
6825000	6827000	on the Penny Arcade... 449,631
6827000	6829000	followers
6829000	6831000	and they sold 3,000 copies of the game?
6831000	6833000	Yeah, because all those guys
6833000	6835000	are really legit.
6835000	6837000	And you know what's great is even
6837000	6839000	after all that they're like, we didn't
6839000	6841000	buy those followers.
6841000	6843000	You know, people are really excited about
6843000	6845000	this game, okay? Really?
6845000	6847000	You know what game sold
6847000	6849000	better than NBA Baller Beats?
6849000	6851000	President Cat.
6851000	6853000	The Eye of Judgment.
6853000	6855000	The Eye of Judgment.
6855000	6857000	Sold better than NBA
6857000	6859000	Baller Beats. Oh, I feel like this
6859000	6861000	is a game on, like, the $25,000
6861000	6863000	pyramid or something.
6863000	6865000	Family Feud or something.
6865000	6867000	Name a game that sold more copies
6867000	6869000	than NBA Baller Beats.
6869000	6871000	Ready? Go.
6871000	6873000	Barbie Horse
6873000	6875000	Adventures 2.
6877000	6879000	Probably not yet, but we will hit that
6879000	6881000	mark. Bungie Ferret Tossing will sell
6881000	6883000	better than NBA Baller
6883000	6885000	Beats.
6885000	6887000	Tokyo Jungle will sell more than NBA
6887000	6889000	Baller Beats. Oh, I'm sure it already has, yeah.
6889000	6891000	Let's see.
6891000	6893000	Secrets of the Mystical Unicorn.
6893000	6895000	The game with the pink anus on
6895000	6897000	Steam has probably sold more than 3,000 copies.
6897000	6899000	I'm trying to think, what
6899000	6901000	was the worst game I can think of that's
6901000	6903000	a paid game? Worst
6903000	6905000	game ever.
6905000	6907000	Night Trap sold
6907000	6909000	more than NBA Baller Beats.
6909000	6911000	I was going to say
6911000	6913000	Bullet Witch sold more copies than NBA
6913000	6915000	Baller Beats. Master Chu and the
6915000	6917000	Drunk Nard Who on the NES probably sold
6917000	6919000	more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
6919000	6921000	Hell, even
6921000	6923000	Steel Battalion, that last one
6923000	6925000	that came out, sold more
6925000	6927000	than that. And it was fucking
6927000	6929000	broken.
6929000	6931000	Beatmania sold more copies than
6931000	6933000	NBA Baller Beats.
6933000	6935000	Burn!
6935000	6937000	Pop and Music on
6937000	6939000	Xbox Live Arcade or what was it called?
6939000	6941000	Beat and Groovy sold more copies
6941000	6943000	than NBA Baller Beats.
6943000	6945000	Do you remember that song
6945000	6947000	that was really obnoxious and horrible
6947000	6949000	last summer, the
6949000	6951000	Louie Louie Gucci Gucci Fini Fini Prada
6951000	6953000	Basic Bitches Wear That Shit So I Don't Even
6953000	6955000	Bother. Her album came out. It's the worst
6955000	6957000	album sale that sold
6957000	6959000	like, it's not quite a record
6959000	6961000	but it sold 3,900 copies
6961000	6963000	in its first week. That's more than this game.
6963000	6965000	Creation.
6965000	6967000	What's the single called?
6967000	6969000	Gucci Gucci. Gucci
6969000	6971000	Gucci. Hold on, I want to look this up.
6971000	6973000	It was just the single.
6973000	6975000	Please don't play it. Do you really hate your listeners
6975000	6977000	that much? No, it was just
6977000	6979000	a single last year but she actually
6979000	6981000	put out a full album
6981000	6983000	with that song and no one gave a fuck
6983000	6985000	but more people gave a fuck.
6985000	6987000	Okay, so more people
6987000	6989000	gave a fuck about this song.
6989000	6991000	No, that's not it.
6991000	6993000	Oh, this one.
6993000	6995000	Okay, more people bought
6995000	6997000	this CD than
6997000	6999000	bought Baller Beats.
7003000	7005000	Wait, what's the chorus?
7015000	7017000	This is so awful.
7027000	7029000	This is really badass. This is too long. Where's the chorus?
7033000	7035000	I can't make it to the chorus.
7035000	7037000	You probably picked the worst part of the song, Dev.
7037000	7039000	Whatever.
7039000	7041000	So there you go, the worst part of the worst
7041000	7043000	song. Worst part of the worst
7043000	7045000	song and that, and yeah, and Dartusuya
7045000	7047000	says that song was probably in NBA Baller Beats.
7053000	7055000	Let's see, Act Dev says more people bought
7055000	7057000	ET on the 2,600 than NBA Baller
7057000	7059000	Beats. Jessica Harper said
7059000	7061000	Britney's dance beat probably sold more
7061000	7063000	copies than NBA Baller Beats.
7063000	7065000	Oh, Rama. Oh.
7065000	7067000	Burn. This, oh.
7067000	7069000	Ouch.
7069000	7071000	Rock Revolution sold
7071000	7073000	more copies than NBA Baller Beats.
7073000	7075000	That's a fact.
7075000	7077000	Oh, ouch. Oh, you
7077000	7079000	win. You win an internet.
7079000	7081000	This story's over.
7083000	7085000	Marissa. I love Marissa.
7085000	7087000	I really do and she's in our chat room
7087000	7089000	and she just said, this bitch
7089000	7091000	just rapped about Adderall.
7095000	7097000	By the way, does this still work?
7097000	7099000	I just want to point this out. I want Marissa to know
7099000	7101000	this because this is how bad Marissa needs to come back to
7101000	7103000	the show. Okay, you know how Google, Google
7103000	7105000	has the predictive search feature, right?
7105000	7107000	Okay, I want to show you something. Go to Google
7107000	7109000	and type orange
7109000	7111000	lounge
7111000	7113000	radio
7113000	7115000	and oh, of course,
7115000	7117000	the one time I do it, oh, you know why? Because I'm not doing
7117000	7119000	global research.
7119000	7121000	But I swear to God, I did this the other day.
7121000	7123000	I typed in orange lounge radio
7123000	7125000	and in the predictive search, the
7125000	7127000	number two thing that came up said orange lounge
7127000	7129000	radio Marissa.
7129000	7131000	Not orange lounge radio
7131000	7133000	chat room, orange lounge radio
7133000	7135000	Loki. It was orange lounge
7135000	7137000	radio Marissa. Swear to God, I was looking
7137000	7139000	at this yesterday and I was laughing my ass off
7139000	7141000	in a good way because I love Marissa. But it's just
7141000	7143000	funny that, well, how long ago was it she was
7143000	7145000	on this show?
7147000	7149000	Alright, anyhow,
7149000	7151000	let's move on.
7151000	7153000	An appropriate story
7153000	7155000	to follow that last story is
7155000	7157000	about a game design
7157000	7159000	jam called Fuck This Jam.
7159000	7161000	It will, uh,
7161000	7163000	I have no, who is putting
7163000	7165000	this on? It's on a website. It's called
7165000	7167000	FuckThisJam.com. Well, that's appropriate.
7167000	7169000	Oh, okay, here it is. It's
7169000	7171000	organized by Rami Ismail
7171000	7173000	of Vlambeer
7173000	7175000	and independent designer Fernando Romalo.
7175000	7177000	Uh, Fuck This Jam
7177000	7179000	apparently was basically
7179000	7181000	an inside joke. It came out of a conversation
7181000	7183000	that they had when they went to an arcade
7183000	7185000	in Austin, Texas. It will take
7185000	7187000	place from November 9th through the 17th.
7187000	7189000	Well, why
7189000	7191000	would you care about this besides the cute name?
7191000	7193000	Well, because
7193000	7195000	the participants in this little
7195000	7197000	contest or whatever, they
7197000	7199000	will be tasked with creating a game
7199000	7201000	in a genre or style
7201000	7203000	that you would ordinarily have
7203000	7205000	disdained for. So, in
7205000	7207000	other words, let's say you're the type of person that's like,
7207000	7209000	you know what? I hate sports games.
7209000	7211000	You know, I don't want to play sports. I never play sports
7211000	7213000	games. Then your job in the jam
7213000	7215000	would be to design a sports game.
7215000	7217000	Or let's say, you know, I hate first-person shooters.
7217000	7219000	You gotta design a first-person shooter. I hate
7219000	7221000	retro games. I hate role-playing.
7221000	7223000	So, I actually
7223000	7225000	think this is a really neat idea to
7225000	7227000	encourage people to get out of their comfort zones
7227000	7229000	because this is where some of the best ideas come from.
7229000	7231000	And you know it's gonna lend itself
7231000	7233000	to crossover
7233000	7235000	potential. I bet something out of this ends
7235000	7237000	up on Project Greenlight or something. Just you wait.
7237000	7239000	Just you wait.
7239000	7241000	Good luck to everybody that's participating
7241000	7243000	in that. Fuck this jam.
7243000	7245000	Alright, well let's go to the mailbag.
7245000	7247000	Every week you guys send us emails
7247000	7249000	at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
7249000	7251000	and we
7251000	7253000	pick our favorites out of the mailbag and read them
7253000	7255000	live on air. Dark Soccer
7255000	7257000	is not here to read them tonight.
7257000	7259000	But Alan, being such a good sport, has volunteered
7259000	7261000	here to read the emails. It probably helped that
7261000	7263000	there was only one. Yes.
7263000	7265000	Now there's one
7265000	7267000	email and I
7267000	7269000	really empathize with this
7269000	7271000	person who was kind enough to write it in
7271000	7273000	because when I write stuff I'm often
7273000	7275000	very verbose and go on about something
7275000	7277000	I care a lot about. It's a Windows 8
7277000	7279000	rant email and this person
7279000	7281000	did say how long it is.
7281000	7283000	And it is long enough that we're not gonna read the whole
7283000	7285000	thing on the show. It's not personal.
7285000	7287000	So it is
7287000	7289000	from
7289000	7291000	13X
7291000	7293000	Forever. And he writes
7293000	7295000	a Windows 8 email and he says,
7295000	7297000	Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you
7297000	7299000	have an empty mailbox problem so I finally took
7299000	7301000	my time to write about that Windows 8 hate
7301000	7303000	show two weeks ago. First off, I
7303000	7305000	love that our show is now a relay
7305000	7307000	to Bobby as well as just like
7307000	7309000	blast us with an email
7309000	7311000	and hope Bobby gets some splash damage
7311000	7313000	from it all.
7313000	7315000	It's an AOE attack. Exactly.
7315000	7317000	Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you have an
7317000	7319000	empty mailbox problem so I finally took my time
7319000	7321000	to write about that Windows 8 hate show
7321000	7323000	two weeks ago. Yeah, this mail will
7323000	7325000	be long so maybe you should skip it
7325000	7327000	for the show. Sorry. Also, I have to apologize in advance
7327000	7329000	if I trail off topic or go
7329000	7331000	on rumble for too long.
7331000	7333000	And then, first
7333000	7335000	of all, I highly recommend to
7335000	7337000	read Paul Allen's take on Windows 8
7337000	7339000	with a link. Interface changes
7339000	7341000	and Rafael Rivera's
7341000	7343000	post on the
7343000	7345000	Minecraft certification debacle and
7345000	7347000	optionally his own rant
7347000	7349000	or the person who wrote this in
7349000	7351000	on Google Plus on this topic.
7351000	7353000	And then it goes on and
7353000	7355000	unfortunately we can't read all of it but
7355000	7357000	he did include, thank you
7357000	7359000	writer, a TLDR
7359000	7361000	summary.
7361000	7363000	Smart idea when you send in a long
7363000	7365000	email. Include the too long, didn't read
7365000	7367000	portion. So
7367000	7369000	TLDR summary. You should really try it
7369000	7371000	for yourself before judging. Sometimes to
7371000	7373000	build something new you have to break something old and
7373000	7375000	people will hate you for it. All
7375000	7377000	of the hate on the internet for Windows 8 stems
7377000	7379000	from a few articles published by ignorant writers
7379000	7381000	to get more clicks for their websites.
7381000	7383000	Desktop experience is the same as for
7383000	7385000	Windows 7, only much more polished. Plus
7385000	7387000	you have Metro which is mostly
7387000	7389000	optional. Notch is
7389000	7391000	fighting some illusory
7391000	7393000	threats of software freedom on
7393000	7395000	commercial OS 2 in most unconventional
7395000	7397000	ways. Yes, Windows 8 will sell
7397000	7399000	worse than Windows 7 and everyone will
7399000	7401000	point and laugh. You're probably biased
7401000	7403000	Russian neighbor 13x
7403000	7405000	forever. So I'm wondering maybe
7405000	7407000	if I'm on the vlog article
7407000	7409000	for when the podcast, this episode goes up
7409000	7411000	maybe we can include that email. Perhaps.
7411000	7413000	On the forums. On the forums. Yeah, I would say
7413000	7415000	make a long post on the forums. But I
7415000	7417000	will tell you this. I did read the email in its entirety
7417000	7419000	off air. And it was, you know, the
7419000	7421000	TLDR does sum it up pretty good because even
7421000	7423000	though it was through kind of some fanboy
7423000	7425000	filter, I did sense a little bit
7425000	7427000	of that in there. There was
7427000	7429000	a good point that was raised that is essentially
7429000	7431000	don't knock it until you've tried it.
7431000	7433000	You know, many people are sitting here bashing
7433000	7435000	Windows 8 just because
7435000	7437000	they've seen some screenshots and
7437000	7439000	they don't like the fact that there's something
7439000	7441000	different. That they're presenting the start menu
7441000	7443000	and it's different. And the kind of,
7443000	7445000	again, I'm paraphrasing here and this is
7445000	7447000	the message I took from it was essentially
7447000	7449000	change is gonna happen.
7449000	7451000	Change is inevitable. Change has
7451000	7453000	to start from somewhere. If you like
7453000	7455000	the start menu, didn't the start menu
7455000	7457000	start somewhere, right? So
7457000	7459000	why is everybody hating on this
7459000	7461000	when many of them haven't tried it?
7461000	7463000	Granted, some have. But many haven't
7463000	7465000	and they're just looking at these screenshots going
7465000	7467000	oh, I hate this. I hate this because it
7467000	7469000	looks like an Xbox. And I
7469000	7471000	say this being guilty
7471000	7473000	of being someone who usually
7473000	7475000	crawls up Valve's ass at every
7475000	7477000	opportunity. But it wasn't Gabe Newell
7477000	7479000	but someone, there's the whole debacle with Notch
7479000	7481000	bitching about it. But someone at
7481000	7483000	Valve, not Gabe Newell
7483000	7485000	basically said we've messed around
7485000	7487000	with the Windows 8 kit and
7487000	7489000	he was like, personally he didn't want to design
7489000	7491000	software for it because he thought it was a big steaming turd.
7491000	7493000	So whenever someone from Valve says something
7493000	7495000	everyone like
7495000	7497000	Valve says Windows 8 is garbage
7497000	7499000	and then it just echoes through the whole
7499000	7501000	internet which is not really
7501000	7503000	what they said. Right.
7503000	7505000	The whole game of telephone happens. Yeah.
7505000	7507000	So, interesting. Now I will say
7507000	7509000	there was also a portion of the email that really
7509000	7511000	addressed the whole Windows certification thing
7511000	7513000	and the fact that I think people are reading
7513000	7515000	too much into it and it's not that Microsoft
7515000	7517000	wants a cut. That was a huge part of what
7517000	7519000	the Valve complaint was too.
7519000	7521000	But it's not that, just to be clear, it's not
7521000	7523000	that Microsoft wants a cut of it. It's
7523000	7525000	that Microsoft wants to certify it
7525000	7527000	and I'm assuming it's similar to
7527000	7529000	how they might certify
7529000	7531000	like I know because I've done
7531000	7533000	some of this development at work, like
7533000	7535000	it's harder to run macros
7535000	7537000	and even like access in Word if
7537000	7539000	you don't like certify your
7539000	7541000	content because of the
7541000	7543000	illegitimate stuff that's out there. So like
7543000	7545000	imagine expanding that bubble to include
7545000	7547000	software. That's kind of where it's going.
7547000	7549000	Isn't that kind of like the Nintendo
7549000	7551000	official seal of equality where they had to play
7551000	7553000	every game even if it was bad to make sure it was good enough?
7553000	7555000	They don't do that anymore because
7555000	7557000	of course the Wii is the biggest shovelware
7557000	7559000	console in like 10 years.
7559000	7561000	Well and also people got around
7561000	7563000	the Nintendo seal of equality. Like it worked for
7563000	7565000	a while but then when it was
7565000	7567000	because Atari
7567000	7569000	and Tengen as it was won that lawsuit
7569000	7571000	where they tried to stop that
7571000	7573000	from happening. They were able to keep
7573000	7575000	Tetris off the shelves because that was
7575000	7577000	a particular circumstance but they
7577000	7579000	were not able to keep those cartridges off shelves.
7579000	7581000	I can't remember if the lawsuit was Tengen
7581000	7583000	specifically or if it was one of the other companies like
7583000	7585000	Color Dreams or you know
7585000	7587000	one of them back in the day but Nintendo tried to stop it.
7587000	7589000	They lost so there was nothing they could do about it.
7589000	7591000	So I think at that point they kind of gave up.
7591000	7593000	But yeah Nintendo,
7593000	7595000	Nintendo put those locks into place because they were
7595000	7597000	trying to prevent another video game crash.
7597000	7599000	The other big big big thing they did on the NES
7599000	7601000	remember this. Yeah because a lot of the games on the 2600
7601000	7603000	weren't even designed on proper
7603000	7605000	development kits. They were trash. Yeah.
7605000	7607000	Well publishers could only put out three games a year.
7607000	7609000	If you paid for these development kits
7609000	7611000	or whatever you could only put out three games a year.
7611000	7613000	So that's why, well you had these publishers
7613000	7615000	start to put out, just invent
7615000	7617000	subsidiaries to get around it. That's where
7617000	7619000	Ultra Games came from. Ultra Games was
7619000	7621000	just Konami. That's all it was.
7621000	7623000	It was just Konami and it existed solely
7623000	7625000	to put out you know
7625000	7627000	more Konami games on the NES
7627000	7629000	like Metal Gear
7629000	7631000	and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
7631000	7633000	or Ultra Games. Yeah.
7633000	7635000	But it was Konami. So anyway
7635000	7637000	that was a
7637000	7639000	total tangent that that emailer was not
7639000	7641000	expecting at all whatsoever but there you go.
7641000	7643000	So at the end of the day let's go back
7643000	7645000	take a step back. What about
7645000	7647000	the course part
7647000	7649000	of the argument I think what I
7649000	7651000	took away from it was
7651000	7653000	don't knock it until you've tried it.
7653000	7655000	Alan is it fair?
7655000	7657000	That's fair. You haven't tried it so should you
7657000	7659000	be knocking it? Yeah.
7659000	7661000	Windows, well it's, I made a joke once
7661000	7663000	that Windows OS's are like the
7663000	7665000	Star Trek movies, the original ones that every other one
7665000	7667000	is a piece of shit and the other, every other one is really good.
7667000	7669000	Because
7669000	7671000	XP Professional I ran
7671000	7673000	for years because it was rock solid.
7673000	7675000	When Vista came out
7675000	7677000	they tried to drag
7677000	7679000	gamers over to Vista by saying if you want
7679000	7681000	DirectX 10 you have to use
7681000	7683000	Vista. I'm like DirectX
7683000	7685000	fine it's 9 for me I'll stay on
7685000	7687000	XP. And now 7 is so
7687000	7689000	fucking good I can't imagine why I'd want to leave
7689000	7691000	7. 7's great.
7691000	7693000	And the bummer
7693000	7695000	is like it's not like you can just like try
7695000	7697000	8 out and then go back. Oh yeah it's a total
7697000	7699000	I don't
7699000	7701000	think you can. No I don't think you can
7701000	7703000	down rev Windows. So
7703000	7705000	it's either all in or out.
7705000	7707000	Alright well thank you very much for the
7707000	7709000	email even if it was a little long.
7709000	7711000	Hopefully we covered the points
7711000	7713000	to your satisfaction and we you know
7713000	7715000	either way we still appreciate the
7715000	7717000	other perspective. It is the show
7717000	7719000	where every gamer has a voice. We
7719000	7721000	get to disagree sometimes.
7721000	7723000	Alright let's get into the FUs of the week.
7737000	7739000	Uh
7739000	7741000	Loki why don't you start us off tonight
7741000	7743000	with your FU. Uh an FU to
7743000	7745000	uh e-machine shop
7745000	7747000	for their fur I'm not working
7747000	7749000	nicely with uh Google Sketch
7749000	7751000	unfortunately. The wonderful
7751000	7753000	painstaking process of creating
7753000	7755000	the part of the
7755000	7757000	beat gear pad or whatever
7757000	7759000	um it came out nice
7759000	7761000	so they can't import it at all.
7761000	7763000	So and I tried recreating it
7763000	7765000	in their stupid cat editor
7765000	7767000	and it sucks.
7767000	7769000	So fuck that.
7769000	7771000	Um
7771000	7773000	you know despite all the stress I went
7773000	7775000	through in the past week I had a pretty good weekend
7775000	7777000	so I can't complain too much although I will
7777000	7779000	say FU to my voice.
7779000	7781000	And FU to the fact that I'm getting
7781000	7783000	old. That part kind of sucks
7783000	7785000	and uh yeah I did I didn't just
7785000	7787000	do rock the something keep in mind I didn't
7787000	7789000	just do Rocky on Friday.
7789000	7791000	I actually helped out with another performance
7791000	7793000	piece that um some of the gals
7793000	7795000	on cast asked me to do.
7795000	7797000	Uh just play a really quick walk on roll
7797000	7799000	in and I did it so I had to do that last night.
7799000	7801000	But it's part of that performance I'm
7801000	7803000	supposed to die on stage which means I have to take
7803000	7805000	a stage fall. Yeah
7805000	7807000	totally bruised my knee during doing that
7807000	7809000	yesterday. So that part sucks.
7809000	7811000	So FU to getting old where my
7811000	7813000	bones are old and frail and I can't
7813000	7815000	take falls like I used to be able to.
7815000	7817000	Wah.
7817000	7819000	Alan you're FUs of the week.
7819000	7821000	Um things are going pretty well for me. I got
7821000	7823000	a second day off this week. Um which I
7823000	7825000	wasn't expecting. So the
7825000	7827000	apartments all clean.
7827000	7829000	Uh I hate
7829000	7831000	I get paid
7831000	7833000	Friday. And you know sometimes when you're like
7833000	7835000	really really really broke waiting for that payday
7835000	7837000	to come up. I'm kind of like that now.
7837000	7839000	Sometimes you can avoid it
7839000	7841000	sometimes you can't.
7841000	7843000	Alright. There it is
7843000	7845000	the FUs of the week.
7845000	7847000	Two more stories and then Twitter topics
7847000	7849000	and the Skype line. So
7849000	7851000	Loki. Alright.
7851000	7853000	So there's going to be some price discounts
7853000	7855000	pretty soon for the Xbox 360.
7855000	7857000	Coming in the form of their holiday
7857000	7859000	bundles. They're actually going to have two bundles
7859000	7861000	out that um actually look pretty cool.
7861000	7863000	There's one that's going to be
7863000	7865000	the Connect 4 gig
7865000	7867000	um well actually I guess the Connect 4 gig
7867000	7869000	um bundle.
7869000	7871000	And they have a 250 gigabyte
7871000	7873000	just regular bundle. Um
7873000	7875000	for 250 you can get a
7875000	7877000	uh holiday bundle which is the
7877000	7879000	250 gigabyte Connect. And
7879000	7881000	those are usually 350 bucks.
7881000	7883000	And I guess the bundles have
7883000	7885000	different games packed in.
7885000	7887000	They've got DLC codes for everything from
7887000	7889000	Forza 4
7889000	7891000	um Connect Disneyland Adventures Fable 3
7891000	7893000	Halo Reach. And
7893000	7895000	also um they're going to have
7895000	7897000	I guess codes for a digital copy of
7897000	7899000	Skyrim. I actually saw that in one of them.
7899000	7901000	Um
7901000	7903000	let's see here. So
7903000	7905000	yeah you can get a 4 gig console for
7905000	7907000	250 or just a regular
7907000	7909000	um
7909000	7911000	system without a
7911000	7913000	Connect bundle in there. Um
7913000	7915000	for 250 and that comes with
7915000	7917000	Forza and Skyrim as a digital
7917000	7919000	copy. And then also they have
7919000	7921000	a 4 gig Connect
7921000	7923000	um bundle that's going to
7923000	7925000	have um
7925000	7927000	what was in there? Connect Adventures
7927000	7929000	and Connect Disneyland Adventures.
7929000	7931000	Well that's kind of stupid. Why would you
7931000	7933000	buy
7933000	7935000	the old one?
7935000	7937000	I don't know. For whatever reason I guess
7937000	7939000	I'm marking down the old bundles in case you know because it doesn't
7939000	7941000	seem very smart to have the old bundle
7941000	7943000	with less stuff in it for the same
7943000	7945000	for you know more than what it is
7945000	7947000	with more stuff in it. But
7947000	7949000	apparently they still have it at the same price.
7949000	7951000	So you can get the holiday bundle
7951000	7953000	without
7953000	7955000	Connect Disneyland Adventures. I guess if
7955000	7957000	you really hate Disney and you just
7957000	7959000	you know fuck it I'm not getting anything extra
7959000	7961000	um
7961000	7963000	you can do that. So those are three bundles
7963000	7965000	that are available. Um
7965000	7967000	I guess now. So you can check that out.
7967000	7969000	And then um
7969000	7971000	some older holiday bundles too. They've got
7971000	7973000	one with Halo Reach and
7973000	7975000	Fable 3. That was the old one.
7975000	7977000	But I guess that's not available anymore.
7977000	7979000	Cool.
7979000	7981000	No surprise there. Price drops in time
7981000	7983000	for the holidays. And for Wii U.
7983000	7985000	Maybe that it's yeah true competition
7985000	7987000	there and maybe to you know just encourage a few more
7987000	7989000	copies to move after Thanksgiving. Honestly though
7989000	7991000	I mean if you don't give a shit about
7991000	7993000	Connect which honestly
7993000	7995000	nowadays you probably shouldn't
7995000	7997000	give a shit about Connect Lisa's console
7997000	7999000	generation. The one with
7999000	8001000	Forza 4 and Skyrim is a pretty good deal.
8001000	8003000	I mean those are pretty awesome games.
8003000	8005000	Good tip.
8005000	8007000	Alright one more story
8007000	8009000	for you guys and this is about what could have
8009000	8011000	been uh Blizzard
8011000	8013000	had once planned a version of Diablo
8013000	8015000	for the Game Boy Color.
8015000	8017000	Can you even imagine that?
8017000	8019000	Ew. Right?
8019000	8021000	Like Starcraft on N64
8021000	8023000	you remember that? Now this
8023000	8025000	was uh in a statement from
8025000	8027000	well I shouldn't say a statement but it was more of an
8027000	8029000	interview of Blizzard biographer
8029000	8031000	David Craddock uh in
8031000	8033000	speaking with Shaq News.
8033000	8035000	It was called Diablo Junior.
8035000	8037000	It was intended as a single
8037000	8039000	player only prequel to the original
8039000	8041000	game. Taking a page from
8041000	8043000	Pokemon's book the team wanted to
8043000	8045000	release three cartridges
8045000	8047000	each packing a different hero in the
8047000	8049000	warrior rogue sorcerer vein
8049000	8051000	as well as items that players
8051000	8053000	would have to trade for in order to
8053000	8055000	collect.
8055000	8057000	Development was only with a
8057000	8059000	handful of staff. They started
8059000	8061000	working on Diablo Junior after the
8061000	8063000	release of Diablo 2.
8063000	8065000	It could have been the Game Boy Color or the
8065000	8067000	Game Boy Advance or both
8067000	8069000	I guess just due to the timing of all of
8069000	8071000	this. Um
8071000	8073000	Diablo Junior was ultimately put out to
8073000	8075000	pasture because of the steep production costs
8075000	8077000	associated with developing handheld
8077000	8079000	games. Uh
8079000	8081000	I guess there is a book coming out
8081000	8083000	or a project called Stay Awhile
8083000	8085000	and Listen. It's an unauthorized
8085000	8087000	history of Blizzard based
8087000	8089000	on the testimony of 80X
8089000	8091000	employees. This
8091000	8093000	gonna be good.
8093000	8095000	Wow I didn't know somebody was working on
8095000	8097000	something like that. That sounds like it's gonna be amazing.
8097000	8099000	Uh apparently there
8099000	8101000	was also another Diablo 2 expansion
8101000	8103000	that never saw the light of day.
8103000	8105000	Uh there was um uh
8105000	8107000	it was gonna have guild halls for multiplayer
8107000	8109000	clan meetings and two other character
8109000	8111000	classes that also came out of that.
8111000	8113000	Weren't there also a bunch of
8113000	8115000	around the time Warcraft 2
8115000	8117000	between Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 there was gonna be a bunch of
8117000	8119000	orc based side story
8119000	8121000	games? I remember seeing
8121000	8123000	clips of that yeah. And the animation was
8123000	8125000	very, they kinda look like the Zelda CD
8125000	8127000	Phillips CDI games. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Same style.
8127000	8129000	They did they did. I wanna know what
8129000	8131000	happened to Starcraft Ghost. I hope we
8131000	8133000	get the low down on that. Yeah.
8133000	8135000	Ooh.
8135000	8137000	I like this. The uh unauthorized
8137000	8139000	look. Or they're really awesome franchises
8139000	8141000	from the 90's they haven't touched.
8141000	8143000	Like Lost Vikings.
8143000	8145000	Or Blackthorn. Or Rock and Roll
8145000	8147000	Racing.
8147000	8149000	Didn't they also do the shake, rattle, and
8149000	8151000	roll? Was that Blizzard? I don't know.
8151000	8153000	They got more franchise.
8153000	8155000	Snake, rattle, and roll. Who did that?
8155000	8157000	Is there
8157000	8159000	is more out there than wow
8159000	8161000	and Diablo
8161000	8163000	Blizzard.
8163000	8165000	Or they could come up with something new. I know
8165000	8167000	that's a uh
8167000	8169000	whatever. Whatever Titan is.
8169000	8171000	Whatever Titan is supposed to be completely unique
8171000	8173000	IP. Oh I'm an idiot. Snake, rattle, and roll
8173000	8175000	was just straight up rare.
8175000	8177000	Why did I think that was Blizzard?
8177000	8179000	Am I really that
8179000	8181000	dumb? I guess
8181000	8183000	so.
8183000	8185000	Whatever. Shut up.
8185000	8187000	Alright let's go to the
8187000	8189000	Skype line at
8189000	8191000	1877 game OLR
8191000	8193000	where our username on Skype is
8193000	8195000	OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is
8195000	8197000	open right now.
8197000	8199000	And while we're waiting for
8199000	8201000	some calls to come in we will do some
8201000	8203000	tweets. Tigerclaw
8203000	8205000	sent in a few tweets tonight. See
8205000	8207000	in here I thought it was a slow news week and yet
8207000	8209000	we've got more stories coming in thanks to
8209000	8211000	Twitter so I appreciate that. Tigerclaw
8211000	8213000	on Twitter with a story EA apparently
8213000	8215000	accidentally gave away thousands of
8215000	8217000	free games. Yeah.
8217000	8219000	How the hell did this happen?
8219000	8221000	They had a code that was
8221000	8223000	I think it was for reviewers or something like that
8223000	8225000	for Origin where it gave people
8225000	8227000	$20 off. Yeah it said it was a thanks
8227000	8229000	for completing a survey and it allowed them to
8229000	8231000	download a free game from Origin
8231000	8233000	but the code could be used by
8233000	8235000	anybody. It was an unlimited use
8235000	8237000	code. That's the
8237000	8239000	problem. I'm reading it here on the story. This code
8239000	8241000	is not secured. Someone made EA lose money
8241000	8243000	they're gonna have to commit seppuku in a conference
8243000	8245000	room. Oh my gosh. Alright.
8245000	8247000	Apparently it ended up on Reddit.
8249000	8251000	Alright let's go to the phones. We got somebody
8251000	8253000	waiting. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8253000	8255000	It's Shane. Hey Shane. How you doing?
8255000	8257000	I'm good. How about you guys?
8257000	8259000	I'm good. What's on your mind?
8259000	8261000	So I want to talk about
8261000	8263000	a little game called Mass Effect.
8263000	8265000	I have never heard of this game.
8265000	8267000	Why don't you tell us about it?
8267000	8269000	Okay anyway before
8269000	8271000	the new multiplayer
8271000	8273000	stuff came out and the mega DLC
8273000	8275000	stuff got announced
8275000	8277000	Mike, I think it's Gamble
8277000	8279000	posted something about how the upcoming
8279000	8281000	DLC is kind of like
8281000	8283000	the shape of things to come
8283000	8285000	and I'm wondering
8285000	8287000	if this DLC
8287000	8289000	is kind of
8289000	8291000	pointing at a more
8291000	8293000	massive multiplayer
8293000	8295000	Mass Effect game.
8295000	8297000	Because now with the introduction of the
8297000	8299000	Volus class. Here we go.
8299000	8301000	Mass Effect MMO. Hold on.
8301000	8303000	I'm justifying it.
8303000	8305000	Alright. With the Volus
8305000	8307000	class apparently it's
8307000	8309000	pretty much just a support class
8309000	8311000	like I mean you can still
8311000	8313000	kill things and be really awesome
8313000	8315000	but it's primarily for
8315000	8317000	support so if you've got a support class
8317000	8319000	your vanguards can take
8319000	8321000	hits like really well
8321000	8323000	and everybody else can do you know shooty
8323000	8325000	things why not something in the
8325000	8327000	vein of like a PSO style game where
8327000	8329000	you have centralized hubs you can
8329000	8331000	still do like
8331000	8333000	massive story missions but
8333000	8335000	it's just all
8335000	8337000	like the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3.
8341000	8343000	Okay. So
8343000	8345000	okay sorry. Run this by me
8345000	8347000	again. How is this going to impact the single player
8347000	8349000	side of it though with the expansion?
8349000	8351000	It doesn't. They were saying that
8351000	8353000	the stuff that's coming out
8353000	8355000	is kind of like the shape of things to come
8355000	8357000	for the series. So you're talking more
8357000	8359000	the DLC that came out this past week
8359000	8361000	and not so much the Omega DLC?
8361000	8363000	Correct. Oh okay. I don't know why but I was
8363000	8365000	saying when you started this whole thing I thought you meant the Omega DLC
8365000	8367000	and I'm like I don't see where that's going.
8367000	8369000	Okay but yeah I get it with the Volus
8369000	8371000	support class and all that. Allen?
8373000	8375000	Yeah I made a comment
8375000	8377000	to Rob earlier that
8377000	8379000	even if the Mass Effect
8379000	8381000	MMO never happens
8381000	8383000	pretty much
8383000	8385000	as limited of a model as
8385000	8387000	it is the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
8387000	8389000	might be the closest that we ever get simply
8389000	8391000	because if you have a favorite race
8391000	8393000	with the exception of the Elcor you can pretty much be
8393000	8395000	everything now.
8395000	8397000	And who knows if the Elcor and the
8397000	8399000	Hanar don't show up sometime
8399000	8401000	down the line. I could see
8401000	8403000	something happen. Also
8403000	8405000	a Volus. I have one
8405000	8407000	if you want to. We can do a match
8407000	8409000	together after the show if you want to see how they play.
8409000	8411000	Would be terrible
8411000	8413000	support for a Vanguard because
8413000	8415000	I couldn't
8415000	8417000	stay close enough to you. They can't
8417000	8419000	hop over cover so they have to actually
8419000	8421000	run around the map. That's
8421000	8423000	kind of adorable in a
8423000	8425000	really weird way. So yeah if a Vanguard
8425000	8427000	biotic charges and fucks
8427000	8429000	off I'm going to have to run to your ass to refresh your shields
8429000	8431000	and that's not going to work. And that's all I
8431000	8433000	do as my Vanguard. I just fly around.
8433000	8435000	But you with my Sentinel
8435000	8437000	worked out alright actually. Yeah we did.
8437000	8439000	We duoed what? Wave 4? Wave 5?
8439000	8441000	Yeah now my Sentinel was only level 4 so that was
8441000	8443000	pretty good. Yeah it was collectors too right?
8443000	8445000	Yeah it was.
8445000	8447000	Which are super fun. They're bastards.
8447000	8449000	Commander
8449000	8451000	Shepherd just joined our chat room and said
8451000	8453000	Hi I'm Commander Shepherd and this is my favorite
8453000	8455000	Mass Effect podcast on the Citadel.
8455000	8457000	If only.
8457000	8459000	You jerk. Alright.
8459000	8461000	It'll happen eventually. Is there anything
8461000	8463000	non, well actually
8463000	8465000	let me ask you this question because
8465000	8467000	whenever people bring up Mass Effect
8467000	8469000	podcasts in chat Black Wolf
8469000	8471000	likes to chime in and say there's not enough
8471000	8473000	content out there to substantiate a weekly
8473000	8475000	podcast. That's a lie now though.
8475000	8477000	It's totally a lie. That's a
8477000	8479000	valid answer because
8479000	8481000	every like
8481000	8483000	there is fan fiction
8483000	8485000	there's fan works
8485000	8487000	like art, music, there are
8487000	8489000	books that have been out, comics
8489000	8491000	that have been out, multiplayer updates
8491000	8493000	that come out. Always speculation
8493000	8495000	going on for the next games.
8495000	8497000	There's enough content there for
8497000	8499000	weekly episodes. For sure.
8499000	8501000	Well then you need to produce a pilot sir
8501000	8503000	and prove everybody wrong.
8503000	8505000	But how
8505000	8507000	am I supposed to do that and play Pokemon in
8507000	8509000	Mass Effect and wow. Alright.
8509000	8511000	And watch Once Upon a Time in
8511000	8513000	Walking Dead. You just gave me
8513000	8515000	an excellent opportunity to transition away
8515000	8517000	from Mass Effect for a minute because you've been
8517000	8519000	playing Pokemon Black 2, White 2
8519000	8521000	and I know that you are a
8521000	8523000	almost 30 year old
8523000	8525000	playing Pokemon
8525000	8527000	games. You even, one of the original
8527000	8529000	VoG articles is about your love of Pokemon
8529000	8531000	and how you know you're a little
8531000	8533000	old for it. So how
8533000	8535000	are the new games and why do you still love
8535000	8537000	this series? I'll never
8537000	8539000	not love this series. They're just really
8539000	8541000	fun RPGs and
8541000	8543000	the Pokemon for the most
8543000	8545000	part are adorable and who doesn't want to
8545000	8547000	collect adorable things?
8547000	8549000	That
8549000	8551000	game was really fun. I played it.
8551000	8553000	They're good.
8553000	8555000	They contract good programmers. They really are
8555000	8557000	good.
8557000	8559000	No, there's just, I don't
8559000	8561000	know. It's just fun. In fact
8561000	8563000	I'm going to see my
8563000	8565000	friends up near Kansas City this
8565000	8567000	weekend and we're going to have a Pokemon
8567000	8569000	tournament. I was just informed and I was like
8569000	8571000	oh heck yes and they're my age too
8571000	8573000	and they're all excited.
8573000	8575000	Alright. I love this comment
8575000	8577000	from Frisbee in the chat room talking
8577000	8579000	about Shane's Mass Effect podcast I'm
8579000	8581000	assuming. Frisbee says
8581000	8583000	there's fan fiction, fan art,
8583000	8585000	fan wank, fan
8585000	8587000	dango, etc.
8589000	8591000	There are Skyrim podcasts that are
8591000	8593000	still going just because of all the mods
8593000	8595000	that you can talk about. Alright, alright,
8595000	8597000	alright. BlackWolf says
8597000	8599000	five weeks in a row.
8599000	8601000	Five weeks in a row. You got to have
8601000	8603000	a show that's got five episodes and then
8603000	8605000	What if I make five episodes
8605000	8607000	in one night and then spread them out over five
8607000	8609000	weeks? Some people do that.
8609000	8611000	You don't say that's what
8611000	8613000	you're doing in advance, dummy.
8613000	8615000	That was hypothetical. Why would I
8615000	8617000	cheat like that?
8619000	8621000	Alright. As I write this down.
8621000	8623000	What else
8623000	8625000	was I going to ask you because you brought up, oh yes,
8625000	8627000	with Pokemon I know you play in a lot of WoW.
8627000	8629000	How's pet battles going for you?
8629000	8631000	I have stopped pet battling because
8631000	8633000	I'm trying to level things and get gear
8633000	8635000	but it's like
8635000	8637000	a terrible addiction
8637000	8639000	and I'm trying to cut myself off cold
8639000	8641000	turkey at the moment and I still think about it
8641000	8643000	every so often and when somebody posts that they
8643000	8645000	got a new pet I'm like I wonder how that
8645000	8647000	would be in battle but I'm
8647000	8649000	just not doing anything with it.
8651000	8653000	Before we let you go for the night
8653000	8655000	is there any message you want to give to Horde
8655000	8657000	tanks out there that might be listening?
8657000	8659000	That's what I was going to say anyway.
8659000	8661000	Glad you brought that up.
8661000	8663000	So if you're a Horde tank
8663000	8665000	preferably a paladin or a warrior
8665000	8667000	and you would like a
8667000	8669000	fun laid back raid group that
8669000	8671000	wants to do content
8671000	8673000	while it's current, please
8673000	8675000	please please
8675000	8677000	server transfer to Proudmoore
8677000	8679000	and get a hold of somebody in
8679000	8681000	the guild Malevolence
8681000	8683000	and we'll find you a home and we won't
8683000	8685000	make fun of you much, I promise.
8685000	8687000	Alright.
8687000	8689000	That's it.
8689000	8691000	Anything else before I let you go?
8693000	8695000	Probably not.
8695000	8697000	Oh, except I was very sad because
8697000	8699000	Alan you talked about
8699000	8701000	Kayden and Shepard fanfic I hadn't
8701000	8703000	read yet and I don't know where to find it.
8703000	8705000	I think I can
8705000	8707000	dig it up.
8707000	8709000	And now I don't have any
8709000	8711000	fix saved to a folder on my hard drive
8711000	8713000	I just know what time my user wrote it.
8713000	8715000	I don't have any fix
8715000	8717000	but I definitely have fun awesome pictures
8717000	8719000	I found that aren't porn.
8719000	8721000	So I have to make that distinction before
8721000	8723000	it gets a little out of hand.
8723000	8725000	As long as no genitalia
8725000	8727000	is showing it's not porn.
8727000	8729000	Oh, there isn't. No. There's none
8729000	8731000	whatsoever. I think that would be weird anyway
8731000	8733000	to have. Alright. I'm ending
8733000	8735000	this conversation before it gets awkward. Bye.
8735000	8737000	I'll keep it awkward. Bye.
8737000	8739000	1877
8739000	8741000	GameOLR. Our username on Skype is
8741000	8743000	OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
8743000	8745000	I think there was another Twitter topic.
8745000	8747000	Do you have any last minute stories Loki
8747000	8749000	while I bring this one up? No.
8749000	8751000	I had the EA one but
8751000	8753000	somebody took it.
8753000	8755000	Somebody took it. Well we got another call coming in
8755000	8757000	so hooray for that. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio
8757000	8759000	who's this? Hey hey it's Rama. Hey Rama
8759000	8761000	how you doing?
8761000	8763000	Ow. My feet.
8763000	8765000	Ooh you're calling in to talk about New York
8765000	8767000	Comic Con I bet. More or less
8767000	8769000	I was actually calling in to kind of
8769000	8771000	agree with the whole pirating thing because
8771000	8773000	even in my fandom we have to deal
8773000	8775000	with it. We call the people
8775000	8777000	that bootleg the anime and so forth
8777000	8779000	we call them spoiled entitlement
8779000	8781000	bitches. Ooh.
8781000	8783000	And just because
8783000	8785000	they're spoiled and entitled? They
8785000	8787000	feel that because
8787000	8789000	it comes out in Japan they can download
8789000	8791000	the fan subs and watch all the episodes
8791000	8793000	and decide not to buy it
8793000	8795000	when it comes released here because they
8795000	8797000	feel that I already have it why should I
8797000	8799000	go out and buy it?
8799000	8801000	Okay I can feel that
8801000	8803000	because I was about to say when you started your thought
8803000	8805000	I was like uh oh cause I was kinda
8805000	8807000	like that for a while cause like
8807000	8809000	and I've admitted to this in the show in the past
8809000	8811000	I have downloaded games that were
8811000	8813000	released in Japan only because
8813000	8815000	I feel if the game companies
8815000	8817000	aren't gonna bother I've also done it with games
8817000	8819000	that were only put out in Europe before they were
8819000	8821000	announced for the America because my thought
8821000	8823000	is if the game companies are not going to
8823000	8825000	put the effort into putting the game
8825000	8827000	out here I'm not gonna pay those
8827000	8829000	import fees and mod my systems
8829000	8831000	and all this stuff or whatever just to
8831000	8833000	uh play the game
8833000	8835000	you know so uh I
8835000	8837000	you know at least could cut the cost
8837000	8839000	out of it and play the game
8839000	8841000	anyway now to be fair
8841000	8843000	uh I did this with Dance Dance Revolution
8843000	8845000	games that came out of Japan but when they released
8845000	8847000	I mean I'm guilty of doing that too
8847000	8849000	and when I released the or
8849000	8851000	when they released the American versions of
8851000	8853000	DDR I bought every single one of them
8853000	8855000	so did I so you know to be fair
8855000	8857000	so it's a little different than your scenario
8857000	8859000	because you're saying they watch it and
8859000	8861000	then when they release it in America the
8861000	8863000	Americanized version or I mean I guess
8863000	8865000	not really the Americanized version but the
8865000	8867000	you know whatever they end up putting out here they
8867000	8869000	fuck off but also on the same token
8869000	8871000	they do it because they can
8871000	8873000	and let's say
8873000	8875000	the series just comes out in the
8875000	8877000	US and the DVDs are like
8877000	8879000	40 bucks for an entire box
8879000	8881000	set people will go and buy
8881000	8883000	that flight on a box set rip
8883000	8885000	the episodes and put them online
8885000	8887000	they'll even put the full disc
8887000	8889000	online and people will find them
8889000	8891000	and download them because they can
8891000	8893000	well
8893000	8895000	and we that's the same thing with games
8895000	8897000	right some pirates do it because they can
8897000	8899000	yeah and it's like I said if
8899000	8901000	Halo 4 comes out at $19.99
8901000	8903000	it'll still be pirate because
8903000	8905000	they want to save that $20 and
8905000	8907000	that same person that doesn't
8907000	8909000	want to drop $19.99 on a game
8909000	8911000	will go buy a spindle of blanks
8911000	8913000	to spread to make copies
8913000	8915000	to give to the French
8915000	8917000	what's this comment you just made in chat Alan
8917000	8919000	that's somewhat on topic with all this
8919000	8921000	oh I was just saying
8921000	8923000	back in the early late late 90s
8923000	8925000	early 2000s I used to order fan subs
8925000	8927000	from anime all the time
8927000	8929000	I don't know if that's what he's talking about
8929000	8931000	specifically Sailor Moon
8931000	8933000	yeah partially
8933000	8935000	and it's become where the companies
8935000	8937000	will contact the fan servers and ask them
8937000	8939000	not to continue with this
8939000	8941000	a lot of them will be like sure no problem
8941000	8943000	some of them are like you know what
8943000	8945000	fuck you we're going to continue to fan sub
8945000	8947000	because we do a better job than you can
8947000	8949000	yeah well a lot of times when
8949000	8951000	a fan sub got a cease and desist
8951000	8953000	that was great news for the community
8953000	8955000	because the only reason why the company was doing that is because
8955000	8957000	we bought the rights to this
8957000	8959000	show it's coming out next year and then the community
8959000	8961000	would be happy because yay they were finally
8961000	8963000	getting it
8963000	8965000	Alan to also go with that
8965000	8967000	same thing happened when Full Metal Alchemist came out
8967000	8969000	since Square Enix
8969000	8971000	pretty much helped put it out in Japan
8971000	8973000	when Funimation picked it up
8973000	8975000	Square Enix told them you got to translate this
8975000	8977000	pretty much word for word
8977000	8979000	you can't mishap anything here or there
8979000	8981000	they're working on setting up the C&D
8981000	8983000	so all the fan sub are selling them oh they can't
8983000	8985000	do this, they're like sure
8985000	8987000	we'll lay off, we'll step back
8987000	8989000	some of those fan subbers will go behind
8989000	8991000	their backs and continue
8991000	8993000	fan subbing the series under a different title
8993000	8995000	and the C&D goes to them and so on
8995000	8997000	and so forth and so forth
8997000	8999000	well Rama
8999000	9001000	I don't want to burn all the time talking about piracy
9001000	9003000	well no it's fine
9003000	9005000	it's a good conversation but I want to hear about a New York
9005000	9007000	Comic Con because I hear Travis was there too
9007000	9009000	and Critical Myth I think was there too
9009000	9011000	I didn't see Critical Myth
9011000	9013000	but I did front it to the
9013000	9015000	one and only Travis Donovan
9015000	9017000	did you? was that the first time you met him?
9017000	9019000	yes, he freaked the fuck out
9019000	9021000	when I walked up to him with my big old
9021000	9023000	afro
9023000	9025000	hahahaha
9025000	9027000	amazing
9027000	9029000	so what did you do and see in New York Comic Con?
9029000	9031000	what was there to do?
9031000	9033000	I mostly went for the cosplays
9033000	9035000	the exhibition hall was ginormous
9035000	9037000	there was a few indie games there
9037000	9039000	but big games that were there
9039000	9041000	was the Capcom booth showing off
9041000	9043000	Darkstalkers Resurrection
9043000	9045000	and then there was the Halo 4 booth
9045000	9047000	and then further down there was Square Enix's
9047000	9049000	new
9049000	9051000	Tomb Raider game
9051000	9053000	oh wow I didn't realize they were going to be there
9053000	9055000	that's cool
9055000	9057000	and unfortunately I wasn't able to check out any of these games
9057000	9059000	because Comic Con decided to give
9059000	9061000	just me, press, and the rest of my staffers
9061000	9063000	no press access at all
9063000	9065000	don't
9065000	9067000	and the lines were like 3 and 4 hours long
9067000	9069000	I couldn't even get up in there in time
9069000	9071000	to try out the Wii U
9071000	9073000	aww that sucks
9073000	9075000	sorry to hear it
9075000	9077000	it is what it is I'll just try to get over to Nintendo World later this week
9077000	9079000	well since I know you're all about the cosplay
9079000	9081000	which I know the listeners can hear more about
9081000	9083000	on Anime Jam Session
9083000	9085000	Tuesday nights on VOG
9085000	9087000	what was some of the good cosplay you saw?
9087000	9089000	believe it or not
9089000	9091000	I see some pretty good
9091000	9093000	My Little Pony cosplays
9093000	9095000	oh god
9095000	9097000	Comic Con is just comics, manga
9097000	9099000	pop culture
9099000	9101000	everything all together
9101000	9103000	that's what it's come down to
9103000	9105000	I did see a couple of good
9105000	9107000	Master Chief cosplayers running around
9107000	9109000	and the most popular one was Scott Pilgrim
9109000	9111000	oh nice
9111000	9113000	yes
9113000	9115000	very cool
9115000	9117000	Black Wolf in Chat says Rama's met two VOG people
9117000	9119000	for the first time in the span of a month
9119000	9121000	because you met Bobby last month huh?
9121000	9123000	yeah when I finally got to the hotel
9123000	9125000	and rested up
9125000	9127000	he shows up in his awesome car and we head on over to Waffle House
9127000	9129000	and chilled
9129000	9131000	as long as I'm still your favorite
9131000	9133000	oh you know that
9133000	9137000	oh and then Travis is going to make you take that back on his show later on
9137000	9139000	is that always the case you know?
9139000	9141000	PAX East is coming up
9141000	9143000	you know one thing we didn't bring up on tonight's show
9143000	9145000	I just realized
9145000	9147000	but we should probably address
9147000	9149000	well here's the thing we can talk about it
9149000	9151000	PAX East badges went on sale
9151000	9153000	and then we can mention
9153000	9155000	oh but they're already gone
9155000	9157000	don't get me started on that
9157000	9159000	I am so pissed and aggravated about that whole situation
9159000	9161000	why? didn't you get a ticket?
9161000	9163000	yeah my brother got me a ticket
9163000	9165000	and when I got home I got Jovi's ticket
9165000	9167000	I got her a Friday, Saturday, Sunday badge
9167000	9169000	that was the only way
9169000	9171000	but the people behind PAX
9171000	9173000	let people buy as many badges as they want
9173000	9175000	and then they went directly to eBay
9175000	9177000	that's why the three day ticket sold out in 24 hours
9177000	9179000	oh lame
9179000	9181000	that's pretty bad
9181000	9183000	I mean if you want to go
9183000	9185000	I'm telling you
9185000	9187000	you're better off getting a Friday, Saturday, Sunday
9187000	9189000	because I don't know about you
9189000	9191000	I don't think you want to go on eBay
9191000	9193000	and try to drop three bills
9193000	9195000	on a three day badge
9195000	9197000	yeah that's not good
9197000	9199000	it really couldn't have happened
9199000	9201000	on a worse week for me
9201000	9203000	I didn't buy a badge
9203000	9205000	I am crossing my fingers and toes
9205000	9207000	that our existence can justify at least one media pass
9207000	9209000	exactly
9209000	9211000	I will be more than happy
9211000	9213000	to interview developers
9213000	9215000	and have vog articles and coverage on the shows
9215000	9217000	and YouTubes and all that stuff
9217000	9219000	just hopefully that'll work out
9219000	9221000	because otherwise I ain't going
9221000	9223000	but this was just like
9223000	9225000	I spent a disgusting amount of money
9225000	9227000	on Rocky Horror, just ask Allen
9227000	9229000	although it might be a little bit of a stressful point
9229000	9231000	but I spent a lot of money on that shit
9231000	9233000	so I didn't have money for badges
9233000	9235000	Rob, I understand Rocky Horror
9235000	9237000	that's your fandom, that's your baby
9237000	9239000	that's your pride and joy
9239000	9241000	I can't say anything about that
9241000	9243000	because if it was something of a hobby of mine like that
9243000	9245000	I would have done the same thing
9245000	9247000	I spent a lot of money on vog too
9247000	9249000	and these podcasts
9249000	9251000	every podcaster on this network
9251000	9253000	spent a lot of money on what they do
9253000	9255000	but we're not saying that in a
9255000	9257000	pity us
9257000	9259000	we are begging for money
9259000	9261000	we just say it in a
9261000	9263000	it's our hobby, it's our passion, it's what we do
9263000	9265000	we do it for what we love
9265000	9267000	go back to PAX East real quick
9267000	9269000	before I move along
9269000	9271000	they're not even putting the media passes
9271000	9273000	registration up until February
9273000	9275000	that is so weird
9275000	9277000	I know
9277000	9279000	so weird, but alright
9279000	9281000	it is what it is, it ain't my con
9281000	9283000	it's a good con, when the con gets here
9283000	9285000	everybody that gets to go will have a good time
9285000	9287000	BlizzCon ain't any better with the way they do it
9287000	9289000	look, the main
9289000	9291000	the most important part is the fact that
9291000	9293000	I secured two rooms
9293000	9295000	for everybody so we have a place
9295000	9297000	to stay, that was the most important thing
9297000	9299000	and we got hotel space from
9299000	9301000	Thursday to Sunday
9301000	9303000	you're the bomb, if I'm able to get a media badge
9303000	9305000	I'm gonna be like, Rama
9305000	9307000	and in that case
9307000	9309000	when you come down, me and Jové
9309000	9311000	we'll head on over to the airport and pick you up
9311000	9313000	oh, you're the bestest
9313000	9315000	we try
9315000	9317000	alright, I should let you go so we can go wrap the show
9317000	9319000	alright, take care bro, thanks, bye
9319000	9321000	bye
9321000	9323000	see, Rama's got my back
9323000	9325000	cause I'm his favorite, we already established this
9325000	9327000	take that Bobby, just kidding
9327000	9329000	Bobby's gonna be at PAX too
9329000	9331000	I know he's going, so
9331000	9333000	who knows, that's kinda cool
9333000	9335000	because since PAX Prime
9335000	9337000	is the same weekend as DragonCon
9337000	9339000	at least we get to have a little bit of PAX in our lives
9339000	9341000	I mean, I shouldn't say that PAX East
9341000	9343000	is less than PAX Prime
9343000	9345000	I like the timing of PAX Prime
9345000	9347000	with the exception of the fact that it's the same weekend as DragonCon
9347000	9349000	I like the timing of PAX Prime
9349000	9351000	a little more than PAX East
9351000	9353000	but I know we'll have a good time at PAX East
9353000	9355000	if I get to go
9355000	9357000	anyhow, I think that's gonna do it
9357000	9359000	I think that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight
9359000	9361000	cause those are some long calls
9361000	9363000	but thank you guys so much
9363000	9365000	to those that called in
9365000	9367000	if for whatever reason you weren't able to get through tonight
9367000	9369000	do send us an email
9369000	9371000	cause we're always short on emails
9371000	9373000	mailbag at orangelaundry.com
9373000	9375000	one more Twitter topic here I want to read about
9375000	9377000	and it has to do with Wing Commander
9377000	9379000	so it's worth mentioning
9379000	9381000	weren't you a fan of Wing Commander back in the day, Alan?
9381000	9383000	I know I was
9383000	9385000	well get this, and this is another tweet from Tiger Claw
9386000	9389000	Chris Roberts announced a new game called Star Citizen
9389000	9391000	didn't we talk about those earlier?
9391000	9393000	did we?
9393000	9395000	I forgot about it if we did
9395000	9397000	it was in chat, I don't think we talked about it on the show
9397000	9399000	I think it was on Bobby's show
9399000	9401000	at the end, but it wasn't on our show
9401000	9403000	anyhow
9403000	9405000	oh well, then I'm saying it twice, it's Wing Commander, deal
9405000	9407000	um
9407000	9409000	Star Citizen from Chris Roberts is happening
9409000	9411000	it's a Kickstarter
9411000	9413000	it's a crowdfunded game
9413000	9415000	but you know
9415000	9417000	it's already raised
9417000	9419000	$455,000
9419000	9421000	with the crowd funding, that's crazy
9421000	9423000	so
9423000	9425000	it's probably going to make at least a million
9425000	9427000	so you can look for the return of Wing Commander
9427000	9429000	even though it's not called Wing Commander
9429000	9431000	but it's from the same guy
9431000	9433000	and obviously it has a spaceship based name
9433000	9435000	so it's going to be the next evolution
9435000	9437000	of that series
9437000	9439000	hopefully it will turn out better than the movie
9439000	9441000	you know, I almost backed that Obsidian one
9441000	9443000	I realized that the game's not coming out until 2014
9443000	9445000	so I was like, fuck that
9445000	9447000	that is a long way away
9447000	9449000	not gonna wait
9449000	9451000	alright
9451000	9453000	that wraps up, if you have no other
9453000	9455000	stories for us, Alan, I don't know if you have anything
9455000	9457000	I don't have any links or anything
9457000	9459000	but I have something quick
9459000	9461000	for those who are in my
9461000	9463000	age group who remember a show called
9463000	9465000	Siffle and Ollie on MTV
9465000	9467000	yes!
9467000	9469000	they're back, and they're on the Machinima
9469000	9471000	channel reviewing fake
9471000	9473000	video games, and it's like they never left
9473000	9475000	I don't
9475000	9477000	because I think this happened a couple weeks ago
9477000	9479000	when the first one showed up, and I don't remember if we
9479000	9481000	brought it up on the show or what
9481000	9483000	but yes, it is hilarious
9483000	9485000	because in the mid and late 90s, you know, MTV
9485000	9487000	did stop showing a lot of music
9487000	9489000	videos
9489000	9491000	for original content, but back in the mid and late
9491000	9493000	90s, that content was actually good
9493000	9495000	because there was
9495000	9497000	liquid television
9497000	9499000	and all this really weird indie shit
9499000	9501000	that kind of honestly paved the way for
9501000	9503000	a lot of the shows on Adult Swim
9503000	9505000	where you're like, do I need to be
9505000	9507000	smoking weed to be watching this shit?
9507000	9509000	what the hell is this?
9509000	9511000	Siffle and Ollie was one of those shows
9511000	9513000	and yeah, they're back
9513000	9515000	Liam, the guy who
9515000	9517000	invented them and wrote them and does the voices
9517000	9519000	was on the Nerdist podcast
9519000	9521000	and he was talking, Chris Hardwick
9521000	9523000	was like, I wish the Nerdist channel
9523000	9525000	had snagged him up
9525000	9527000	Siffle and Ollie are on Machinima
9527000	9529000	Nice. They're good for lulz
9529000	9531000	Let's see, episode 1 has
9531000	9533000	92,000 views, not too bad
9533000	9535000	Not too bad
9535000	9537000	Alright, well thank you very much
9537000	9539000	That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

9549000	9551000	for sticking through all the upsies
9551000	9553000	and downsies of the stream, it looks like we've been okay
9553000	9555000	for the past hour, people stopped complaining
9555000	9557000	in part B, so I guess it was just for
9557000	9559000	30 minutes there or so, it was a little rough
9559000	9561000	but thank you guys for sticking with it, we really appreciate
9561000	9563000	you guys, you troopers
9563000	9565000	If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio
9565000	9567000	remember we don't ask for your money to do this shit
9567000	9569000	all we ask is help spread the word
9569000	9571000	about Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two
9571000	9573000	or leave us a nice review on something like iTunes
9573000	9575000	or a recommendation on Stitcher or TuneIn
9575000	9577000	or any other site, wherever you heard
9577000	9579000	of this show, there are plenty of other people
9579000	9581000	looking for something like
9581000	9583000	this, so word of mouth is great
9583000	9585000	Let's
9585000	9587000	go around and get everybody's final thought
9587000	9589000	Alan, as always, thank you for pinch hitting his host
9589000	9591000	tonight, especially on such short notice, really
9591000	9593000	appreciate it, glad we could have you on
9593000	9595000	even if you do live here, and you know
9595000	9597000	you usually get picked on anyway, but
9597000	9599000	you're always great to have on. Do you have a final
9599000	9601000	thought for listeners tonight? No
9601000	9603000	Bye
9603000	9605000	I'm tired, I'm on a nap, but you can't nap at 9 o'clock
9605000	9607000	that's called going to bed
9607000	9609000	and then you're like a senior citizen
9609000	9611000	You wanna go to IHOP and get a senior citizen
9611000	9613000	special, one piece of bacon and a pancake?
9613000	9615000	I guess an under sedation person
9615000	9617000	after Rocky on Friday
9617000	9619000	was asking Jessica where
9619000	9621000	the big after party was, like
9621000	9623000	Denny's, you know, we're gonna get coffee and chicken strips
9623000	9625000	and it's like, remember when we were all 23?
9625000	9627000	That's not happening
9627000	9629000	Actually, actually
9629000	9631000	you know what's funny, I got invited
9631000	9633000	to go to Mel's by one of the cast members
9633000	9635000	and I was like, I'm sorry
9635000	9637000	I gotta go home
9637000	9639000	It felt bad
9639000	9641000	Our whole lives are ahead of us
9641000	9643000	Let's be until 4
9643000	9645000	Oh, you kids
9645000	9647000	Alright, let's see
9647000	9649000	Loki, your final thought tonight
9649000	9651000	I don't know
9651000	9653000	Hopefully play some Borderlands 2
9653000	9655000	this week
9655000	9657000	My final thought is, hopefully
9657000	9659000	I'll play something besides WoW and Mass Effect
9659000	9661000	this week, not that those are bad games
9661000	9663000	Also, my other
9663000	9665000	final thought is, it is nice to finally
9665000	9667000	be honored with the Golden Lotus
9667000	9669000	Damn you dailies
9669000	9671000	Alright
9671000	9673000	Thank you guys so much for listening to our show
