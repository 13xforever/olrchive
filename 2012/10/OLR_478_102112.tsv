13920	19383	Tonight, October 21st, 2012, Xbox will soon unfriend two of their social applications.
19723	26247	More Sega games are being re-released as download titles, and a PC game ships without the necessary activation keys.
31738	32018	DarkSakura.com
55097	57238	Hello, you've been out for two weeks.
57738	60239	You went from really good stuff to really not so good stuff.
60519	62300	Disneyland, let's focus on Disneyland.
62320	63020	How was Disneyland?
63620	64560	It was gay.
67001	68102	I'm glad you had a happy time.
68482	76845	Well, we didn't actually go into the park on Saturday because our good friend and listener got into a little bit of an accident.
76885	77865	But he's okay, right?
77925	78445	He's okay.
78465	81006	When you first told me that, I was like, oh my god, but he's fine, right?
81026	82507	The car came out a little...
83268	84629	Well, a car is a poppy.
84929	86071	Things we learn in our lives.
86331	87492	Cars are just cars.
87673	88513	People are people.
88654	89114	Exactly.
89314	92098	Dan and I had a fantastic time regardless.
92418	96763	And when I came home, now I'm going to get into the horrible part.
96943	97163	Okay.
97864	99345	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
123082	126564	and she even curled over with an ear poking out.
126605	127545	I've got pictures on Facebook.
127565	130667	I'll repost them in the chat.
132488	134249	She finally started doing better and started eating again.
134570	142535	So I put her back in her room and made sure her towel was in there with her and I let her come into the computer room whenever she wanted.
143415	162840	and um Tuesday like around midnight or so she um well actually yeah it would be Tuesday she was uh half in the laundry room and half out in the hall and she batted my foot and so I stopped and petted her and you know we had a good cuddle and she purred she was a little wheezy when she purred
163400	165582	I was like, oh, it's old lady kitty, you know.
166042	173347	Around 2 o'clock, I was actually about to go to bed, and I went to look for the cat to pet her goodnight, because I always pet Shermie goodnight.
174107	178370	And she was in the living room, dead, just laying on her side.
178470	180932	And I couldn't tell if she was breathing, because she was so fat.
181712	186275	And I went in, and she was still warm, and so I couldn't really tell.
186376	192420	But the moment, there's like a muscle tone that you can feel the difference, and yeah.
193520	201889	So, um, Shermie, I'd have to say she probably died around 1.30 in the morning based on her temperature and everything.
202049	206634	And the fact that, you know, she had rigor mortis doesn't set in for like a few hours anyway.
207454	209016	So, um, yeah, Shermie died.
209817	210317	She was...
211699	223213	15, actually we redid the math and she was probably 16 because I got her when she was a year and a half old so which would have put her birthday in October so she was 16.
224437	225038	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
241834	248259	In case the newer listeners don't know, because we've been taping where we're at now for about a year almost now, probably a year and a half.
248620	250001	But we used to tape the show at your house.
250021	252823	We've actually taped the show at like five different places in the 10-year history.
253103	254224	But we did tape the show at your house.
254884	257586	And you, obviously, you had Shermie.
257646	262210	And Shermie was pretty notorious on the show for sleeping at my feet and so forth.
262350	263871	Her bed was under the table.
263931	267794	And you would sometimes put the mic down near her and say, what do you think about that, Shermie?
267834	268995	And she would actually go, meow.
269535	290446	Well, here he goes Exactly So, yes, this does affect the show in many ways And of course, there was a very infamous moment that happened at one point on the show That I want to bring up a clip of here And I really want to thank Dark Tetsuya for finding this clip for me But this is a clip from, I think he said it was episode number 357?
290906	296049	Yeah This is old, this is old, here it is Well, what's that, Jamie?
297190	298656	I was talking about Shermie.
298897	298997	Oh.
299157	300181	Shermie just crapped.
300543	301044	Oh, did she?
301205	302430	That was her review of the show.
304017	304297	Nice.
305238	306698	That was us talking about the tester.
308079	312160	And Shermie notoriously took a poo on the floor and gave her review of the show.
312480	317522	Her secondary poop spot was... I've told people this before.
317562	318963	Shermie had arthritis in her hips.
319663	328106	And so when she could manage to pee in her box, she just couldn't poop properly in her box because she couldn't actually physically get in her box.
328846	332968	So sometimes she would just wait until people were around and take a poop in the hall.
333970	334901	Look, I have shat!
336397	336917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
364500	376128	And then Dan let me sleep in the next day and he went to have her cremated.
376668	383593	Because actually in Citrus Heights, if a pet is under 15 pounds, then you can just throw them in the dump and he's like...
384033	384473	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
404833	408115	Well, a lot of love for you in our chat room as well.
408175	411736	Live.VogNetwork.com Critical Myth, R.I.P.
411796	413197	Shermie, Orange Ride, R.I.P.
413237	421921	Shermie, Actdeft, You Shall Be Missed, DDR Dollar Bill, Still Want to Say Sorry About Shermie, City Vampire, I'm Sorry, Dark Sakura, Dark Tetsuya, R.I.P.
421961	426603	Shermie, Black Wolf, Shermie had amazing parents.
426743	428184	Lots of love from the listeners as well.
429484	430765	Sorry, I know it's hard.
430785	431145	It's okay.
433926	435947	Most cats aren't so lucky.
458982	468788	I'd say what was funny too is that I was actually, because you know, basically the reason I wasn't here Sunday is because I had cramps so debilitating I could not walk.
469228	476632	I mean, it was literally, I felt like someone had put my girl bits in a vice and, you know, was trying to get orange juice from them.
476672	477733	La la la la la.
477833	478073	Okay.
478733	502906	but I had ended up just sitting down on the floor you know because I couldn't move and it was the most comfortable spot and Shermie padded right over and she liked to sit in between my legs for some weird reason and put her head on my thigh which I've got pictures of her doing it and sticking out her tongue and being cute and she just sat in my lap like that for like an hour and we just hung out and
504622	507784	Well, you know, not to be morbid, but maybe she knew.
508525	509846	Well, they know.
510526	515230	When a cat knows that he or she is going to go, they stop eating.
515710	517552	They go to the same spot over again.
517932	519973	And I was getting that feeling with Shermie.
519994	525257	That's why the first time I picked her up and brought her in the computer room with me, and she was like, oh, okay, I'm fine.
526778	532199	But, it's funny, she wouldn't eat her regular cat food, but she'd still eat the treats from my fingers.
532960	540802	I have a video of that too on Facebook of her eating treats and making the kitty wants nom face.
543042	544082	So, my baby.
545263	546763	We're not going to get another cat.
547119	547679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
564786	574388	It's also, you know, and I hate to put it in terms like this, but are you going to, you know, immediately replace your cousin if they die?
575069	576469	I'm going to go to the store and buy a new cousin.
577329	580650	Or if one of your friends, you know, she's a member of my family.
581490	585371	And maybe it's, you know, some people are just like, oh, it's just a cat.
585551	586411	You can get another cat.
586431	589072	I'm like, but they have their own personalities.
589172	591732	And I had her for 14 years.
591993	592313	Sure.
593033	593473	It's a teenager.
593493	593653	Yeah.
594073	596595	Yeah, she's a whole lady, really.
596655	600037	Let's see, 14 years ago was PlayStation 1, right?
600217	600477	Yeah.
600577	601498	It was about that era.
601518	604060	Dreamcast, that's when Dreamcast were coming into your house.
604280	608803	Yeah, Shermie used to sniff at the VMUs, I remember that.
609484	614567	But, you know, she's a good cat.
616027	621311	Well, yes, it is a video game show, you guys, but sometimes, you know... She's named after a video game, so shut up.
621611	622032	That's true.
622092	623293	She is named after a video game.
623333	624754	Who is Shermie, for those that may not know?
624914	633601	Well, um... Shermie was one of the characters in the King of Fighters series, the one with the dancer type with the hair in front of her eyes.
634141	637063	But when we got Shermie, the adoption paper said Sherman.
637083	639685	I was like, I'm not naming my cat Sherman.
640246	642548	Nina Little didn't know she would become the size of a Sherman tank.
643208	643729	But, um...
645905	650828	So, and I wasn't necessarily going to name her after Sherman from, you know, Mr. Peabody.
652129	653609	So she'd go back in the Wayback Machine.
654210	658212	But she, we were like, well, we need a good name for her.
658472	661134	And so Shermie popped up and it seemed to fit her.
662274	664996	She was graceful at one time.
665036	666437	At one time.
667958	670520	I'm going to go AFK a minute.
670540	671140	That's fine.
672101	673842	At some point, go say hi to the chatters.
673902	675003	They have a lot of very kind things to say.
675023	675823	Yeah, I've been reading it.
675963	676684	And I think we'll help.
677604	678705	But thank you for sharing the story.
679045	687111	And, you know, if you do a show for 478 episodes, we're on at 478, you know, the listeners start to get to know you.
687191	688232	We start to get to know them.
688592	690553	And we want to share these big moments that happen.
690573	691714	We always liked you guys.
693216	694137	And we like Shermie.
694477	695138	We love Shermie.
695699	696119	Oh, come on.
696300	699544	She was... I remember when she actually... Because she would sit on my feet sometimes.
700165	703229	And I remember when she actually got out of her box and sat on your foot.
703889	704430	Out of her bed.
704751	704911	So...
705619	733326	Duke Nukem in our chat room puts it very well video game podcast or not life isn't all about video games sometimes stuff like that happens and intervenes for the games and we all understand no I know you guys understand I'm saying that mostly for the benefit of the new people who might be hearing OLR for the first time because you know every week somebody's gonna hear it for the first time like what is this show I just downloaded all they talk about is dead animals ah but it's it's much more than that guys hopefully that story kind of tells you the family that we've built up here over the years so sure sure is my baby
733926	734006	Yeah.
734427	742833	Especially, and just to share a little personal thing, I mean, Dan and I have been trying for a couple years to conceive.
742874	744555	Well, mostly I've been doing the work.
746356	748218	Because... All right, we'll leave it at that, yes.
748438	749179	We all know what you mean.
749839	753302	I hate when people go, we're pregnant, when really the wife is pregnant.
754603	755884	You're not carrying that baby, dude.
755924	756204	Shut up.
756705	758186	Yes, but he has to put up with you.
759767	761109	Am I right?
761129	761569	Am I right?
761609	761849	Yeah.
765308	772395	But, um, but I mean, Shermie was pretty much, you know, if without that cat, I think I would have been a big wreck.
772515	775718	So, and now I'm like, I don't want any kids.
775738	776599	I just want more cats.
777460	782365	But I'm clearly not going to get another cat, at least until after we move from the house, which will be after December.
783545	803215	and I'm gonna be a rescue just to give a little plug here the animal outreach out here in California they're actually in Placer County they are a no-kill shelter that's where I took Donut or Batcat or Bruce whatever people want to call him there's a little kitten I rescued from the dumpster outside my synagogue
804776	805876	They are a no-kill shelter.
805916	810258	They get animals fixed shots and take them to PetSmart to have them adopted out.
811038	816241	And I would say anyone in the Northern California area, give them your support.
816341	819942	If you're going to get a cat or a dog, go through animal outreach.
820362	821183	They're really good people.
822804	826725	Black Wolf in our chat room says, For those of us without kids, our pets are our kids.
827085	831427	I put up just as many pictures on Facebook of my babies as my friends do of their babies.
831507	832608	I think that's a really good point.
833698	836139	When I come back, I'll spam chat with pictures of Shermie.
836999	837519	Sounds great.
838959	841139	We need an OLR pet community of some sort.
841240	843660	Maybe I'll make a... Why don't we have a Tumblr?
844420	844960	A pet Tumblr.
844980	845640	A pet Tumblr?
845940	846941	OLR pet Tumblr.
847281	850641	You work out all them specifics and we'll work that.
850721	852342	We'll name this episode Cat Shit.
852422	855842	Ragenator says we should dedicate this episode to the memory of Shermie.
856122	856842	Absolutely.
857022	857462	Cat Poop.
857682	858163	Cat Poop?
858203	858603	What?
858663	859543	We'll name it Cat Poop.
859563	860403	Let's probably take it.
860583	862424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
887429	889210	Actdeft in our chatroom says Petsagram.
889230	891351	You know, there's a good point to that.
891731	896352	Without deviating too much, I finally did the sheep thing and I got an iPhone 5 over the weekend.
897373	898513	Jamie's husband sold it to me.
900134	900834	Hey, you know what?
900874	902575	My 4, the button was broken.
902915	904195	The camera was broken.
904335	906616	So I haven't had a camera on my phone for like a year.
906956	908897	So what's the first thing I did with my iPhone 5?
909077	909717	Take cat pictures.
909737	910898	Redownloaded Instagram.
911158	913779	Took a picture of Maruko in the kitty bed and put, I'm back.
914199	919601	So you decided to purchase another phone from a company whose phone broke in a couple years.
920121	920461	Yes.
920781	921081	Awesome.
921161	926303	Well, admittedly, I didn't use a case or anything protective with it, and that's a long story.
926703	928784	But yeah, it's kind of my own fault.
929104	929924	Get an OtterBox.
930845	934188	Funny enough, Alan bought one for me.
934509	939434	Good, because OtterBox is seriously... I'm on my second OtterBox.
939474	940696	It's not because the last one broke.
941056	947343	It was because actually the rubber surrounding it broke and not the thing itself.
948084	951227	All right, let's skip into video games a little bit.
951287	953850	Before we get to our gaming weeks, we usually have a kickoff topic.
953990	957593	Obviously, we've already been talking a little bit, but let's have a game-related kickoff topic.
957994	962958	Loki, I'm going to put you on the spot because you put up this very cryptic tweet over the last week.
963519	966502	And obviously, I perked up because it had the word Disney in it.
966962	971586	So, Loki, I don't know if now is the time you can tell me to F off, but what is this tweet all about?
971626	973008	You said Disney Universe?
973348	983221	Disney Infinity is a new property from Disney that's coming out next year in the spring or summer.
984022	989369	It's going to start tying in with all their movies that they come out with animated and stuff, including re-releases.
989770	990270	Wreck-It Ralph?
991591	992272	Uh, no.
992712	994693	It's, like I said, next year.
994873	995493	So next year.
995633	999535	Oh, because they're going to release, isn't Little Mermaid on deck to be re-released in 3D and all that?
999575	1001316	I don't think that's the next one.
1001936	1003557	I think it's Cars, actually.
1003737	1004057	Really?
1004237	1004497	Okay.
1004537	1007738	Yeah, I think that's the next Pixar movie to be done in 3D or something.
1009259	1022512	But, basically, because I don't know too much about it yet, and there's a lot of speculation to what it is, and I mean, I know a little bit, but it's basically their version of Skylanders.
1023112	1027937	So, it's a game of some sort, I assume some sort of adventure game, although I don't really know what it is.
1028377	1029739	Thank you for watching!
1046818	1050359	They're starting off with some weird stuff.
1050379	1052500	You would think it's like Mickey Mouse and all that stuff.
1052580	1058882	Maybe those are in the starter kits or something like that, but it's basically the Cars characters.
1059482	1063584	There's also Pirates of the Caribbean characters.
1065445	1066225	What else was there?
1066745	1072427	Later on in the fall, they're going to be doing stuff for Frozen, which is their new animated movie.
1072627	1073167	Right, right.
1073187	1074888	That's their big movie for next year.
1075228	1075688	Wreck-It-Ralph
1095285	1100469	No, Tangle was two years ago at this point, because technically it came out Christmas of the year before.
1101770	1105693	Yeah, last year was Winnie the Pooh, and this year is Wreck-It Ralph, and next year is this Frozen.
1106294	1110337	Yeah, so Frozen, and they've had some other stuff.
1111058	1119044	Some of the characters I did see that they mentioned, Jack Skellington, Mickey from the whole Sorcerer's Apprentice stuff.
1120065	1120485	Fantasia?
1121246	1124909	Yeah, they said Sorcerer Mickey or something like that.
1125202	1132723	Well, as much as I might want to sit here and roll my eyes, it does make a heck of a lot of sense for Disney to cash in on that.
1132823	1136304	I mean, obviously, you put the nail on the head.
1136924	1139545	Spyro and Skylanders, say what you will about the game and so forth.
1139565	1140345	Makes them a buttload of money.
1140465	1143505	It makes them an assload of money when you don't even know these characters.
1144005	1145786	Nobody has any attachment to these characters.
1145806	1147626	These characters were made up for this game.
1148146	1151267	Spyro being the one lone distant exception.
1151507	1151927	I don't even...
1152708	1163159	And put Spyro side by side with Mickey Mouse or Jack Skellington or any of the characters you mentioned.
1163219	1164501	And the power of the people.
1164541	1165342	You think people are...
1167804	1170025	are consumer whores over Skylanders characters.
1170365	1175406	You do not even understand how many consumer whores there are for anything Disney.
1175946	1177206	Disney did have that game.
1177226	1178987	Maybe that was the one that was called Disney Universe.
1179007	1180587	They did have that game last year.
1181307	1183948	It was okay.
1184108	1192110	It wasn't going to win any Best Game of the Year awards or anything, but for a family game, pick up, go, it served its purpose.
1192170	1192650	It was fine.
1193030	1204613	You know, so I could totally see that type of engine in that game taken on this, you know, because that game was set, it had a very LittleBigPlanet-esque element to it where you could kind of dress the characters up and so forth.
1204633	1211675	I mean, it wasn't as detailed as LittleBigPlanet, but like, you know, TigerClaw in chat saying, no Tron characters, well, Disney Universe.
1211695	1212036	Well, not yet.
1212076	1216597	This is only, they only have, you know, the first and second wave stuff announced so far.
1216617	1216757	I mean...
1217077	1218898	Disney Universe did have the Tron character.
1218958	1220840	Hell, LittleBigPlanet actually had Tron characters too.
1220860	1221921	They still could do that stuff.
1221961	1225843	If they think about it, they probably have a Tron movie in the works.
1225903	1229786	I know they have another Tron movie probably in a couple years.
1230487	1233309	If not an animated movie or something to cash in on that.
1233489	1237912	That animated series is pretty awesome, which I guess it restarted recently and I have to go catch up on it.
1238172	1239353	Did they renew it for another season?
1239393	1239894	I hope so.
1240254	1245538	I don't know if it's a new season or if it's the second half, like the fall season or something like that, but yeah, it's still going.
1245558	1245938	Dark
1246198	1249582	DarkSakura, you said when you were at Disneyland you saw a lot of the Skylanders stuff, right?
1249683	1250724	I saw like a few things.
1250804	1253127	I thought that was interesting because, you know, it's weird.
1253187	1254829	But it might have been downtown Disney.
1254849	1256311	Oh, okay.
1256351	1258874	You do see a little more bleed over in downtown Disney.
1258894	1259395	That makes sense.
1261417	1262519	But I think it's interesting.
1264215	1265156	I mean, it'll be cool.
1265297	1268341	At the same time, though, I really hate dealing with Skylanders.
1269122	1271906	It's just more of a... It's gonna be all these pieces.
1271946	1272927	It's an internal thing.
1272987	1277573	It's just that the toy industry does not line up well with the way things are done in the game industry.
1277753	1279336	And unfortunately...
1279836	1296973	hundreds of SKUs hundreds well it's not that everything's assorted so unfortunately our system the way it's set up there's no way to set up hey you're going to get random stuff in this box so you have to sell it by the case quantities that come in thankfully the case is 6 or 12 for the characters but
1297814	1302221	It's a receiving nightmare because the way they do it is that case has a UPC on it.
1302261	1305126	That UPC you have to use for each individual character that you order.
1305146	1309733	So if I order 12 of this UPC, we get in one box with that UPC.
1309794	1311817	So it looks like we're getting one twelfth of what we order.
1312439	1313841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1331800	1333942	Suddenly Kingdom Hearts is being recognized by Disney again.
1333962	1334923	That's very exciting.
1335183	1340487	They thought that it was like a Jedi one, but when you pull up on the receipt, it says Kingdom Hearts Mickey.
1340788	1341268	Yay!
1341468	1344170	There's two other pins that I saw online, but they weren't in the park.
1344430	1350695	That would be awesome if they did like a LucasArts, Kingdom Hearts type crossover, like have one of the worlds be Star Wars world or something like that.
1350735	1351516	Don't get your hopes up.
1352557	1353377	Don't go crazy now.
1354118	1356800	Muppets world would happen before Star Wars, because Muppets is Disney now.
1357020	1357761	I understand that, yeah.
1357941	1361023	I believe Pixar's next movie is the Monsters, Inc.
1361043	1361223	prequel.
1387619	1387979	DarkSakura.com
1417165	1424373	I played some Espegaluda, which I'm actually now in my head thinking of it as ESP Eagle.
1424914	1425935	Espegaluda?
1426496	1428258	Because Garuda would be Eagle.
1428838	1430320	And I'm thinking it's Psychic Eagle.
1431361	1432382	So Espegaluda.
1433604	1433744	And...
1436047	1437850	I played, of course, WoW.
1438351	1439093	Fucking Pandas.
1440495	1441757	Is that what the expansion's called?
1441797	1442378	Fucking Pandas.
1442398	1442819	Fucking Pandas.
1444823	1446926	And I finally did Heroics, by the way, which were pretty fun.
1447507	1449070	I did this new Sholomance, by the way.
1450373	1468759	it's actually really well done I liked it played Mass Effect 3 I would play more Mass Effect 3 if it wasn't that the stupid EA servers won't connect I'm going to try Alan's suggestion and try to connect to my Mass Effect 2 but I never had this problem until the patch
1470504	1472946	So, it's clearly something having to do with the patch.
1474167	1475869	In my estimate.
1476789	1480753	I've bought DLC that I can't use because I can't get into single player.
1481894	1485237	Because it won't let me play for my saved game.
1485837	1486498	Low origin.
1486838	1488019	Low, low origin.
1488639	1490461	More like fuck origin, you know?
1491602	1494644	Um... And, uh... I...
1497088	1498789	Yeah, not much of anything else.
1498849	1504151	It's like, I'll sit and play something, but I really have tried not to be at my house too much this past week, so.
1504731	1505291	Understandable.
1505531	1508052	Any playthroughs of stuff that you've watched, Dan?
1508092	1509773	Because you and Dan like to watch these playthroughs.
1509813	1511613	He's obsessed with Borderlands 2.
1511733	1513134	I cannot get... He's beaten it again.
1513434	1513714	Mm-hmm.
1514494	1516455	He's like, oh, it wasn't much harder this time, and...
1518052	1521194	Speaking of playthroughs, I should give this a shout out.
1521214	1522235	This is an important shout out.
1522255	1525077	But shout out to everybody who participated with Extra Life this weekend.
1525377	1529159	Because, I mean, there were tons of playthroughs all over the internet for a great cause this weekend.
1529980	1535304	So I think most of those marathon fests and so forth are probably winding down around now.
1535364	1537445	But props to all you guys who participated with that.
1537825	1538526	That's a great cause.
1538866	1540807	I really want us to do something like that at some point.
1541167	1542628	Even our buddy Breslow.
1543289	1543409	Mm-hmm.
1544789	1545950	You raised $3,300?
1545990	1546950	Yeah.
1547010	1548210	That's not a bad chunk of change.
1548550	1549151	Good for you, buddy.
1549551	1549791	Yeah.
1550371	1550691	Excellent.
1551191	1552512	All right, well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1553712	1555532	I wish I'd played more, but I didn't.
1556473	1559494	I played, let's see, lots of Minecraft.
1560234	1570997	I worked on a giant roller coaster the entire week, and I pretty much finished it, although HitStone was working on some stuff, so I don't know if they go check to see if it's still working again.
1571717	1575018	and then also a giant marquee with Chasing Lights.
1575238	1576139	I had those on there.
1578640	1579220	Let's see.
1579560	1582041	Also play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
1582221	1583781	I managed to pull off Streak Week.
1584582	1592424	That means I did not lose one single lunch game that I played against my coworkers in Call of Duty to their dismay, unfortunately.
1592785	1593605	So now I'm rubbing it in.
1594405	1601450	I was going to go for Streak Month, however, I can't play on Monday because I have to go look for costume stuff for Halloween.
1602230	1603291	What are you doing for Halloween?
1604291	1611356	Well, we'll see if we're going to be too lazy about it or not, but we're going to do costumes for the Yip Yips from Sesame Street.
1611376	1611416	Ha!
1614711	1615231	Thanks for watching!
1632501	1634183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1651477	1652218	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1669533	1674058	But then, so it's that and then some like styrofoam balls for the eyes and pipe cleaners.
1674218	1675279	I mean, so it's really easy.
1675319	1683369	It's just kind of doing the impression, I guess, would be... Just saying, if you ever get hard up for ideas, the chatters would love to see the tingle thing happen.
1683469	1687133	Yeah, it's not going to happen just because, once again, I mean, this is...
1688414	1690035	Listen, here's what we've got, okay?
1690315	1693617	Here's the three costume backup plan ideas that we have.
1693677	1696419	Not necessarily something that... Obviously, it's not going to be something that we do this year.
1697039	1700121	There's Italian Spider-Man, because that's going to be hilarious.
1701902	1704024	How is Italian Spider-Man different from Spider-Man?
1704924	1706185	Have you not seen Italian Spider-Man?
1706405	1708606	Giant Cardboard Robot You're not one to say no to a challenge.
1730948	1735612	I don't really want to buy painter's stilts, so probably not going to do that one.
1736193	1738515	But I don't know.
1738955	1743780	I think it would be funny to do the yippee-yips if we can pull it off.
1745001	1746162	So we may do that.
1746283	1746723	We'll see.
1746743	1753870	Because I'm not entirely broke right now, but I could be doing other things right now.
1754410	1754831	So we'll see.
1755106	1756447	I love the chat room is trying.
1756467	1757047	They're trying.
1757527	1766913	Black Wolf in our chat room says, Let's say, just as a hypothetical, if I paid for Loki's airfare, accommodations, and Dragon Con badge, would he cosplay as Tingle at Dragon Con?
1767013	1769134	No.
1769154	1770715	But I would if you paid for all of that.
1770775	1770975	I know.
1771035	1771735	I'm like, I would.
1771795	1774937	You fail to understand, though, that I can't travel, remember?
1775497	1776038	Oh, yeah.
1776058	1776538	That's right.
1777378	1778299	So that doesn't work.
1779040	1783165	That's... There's no one of the difference about having the baby and having the kitty.
1783385	1786569	Somebody can come watch the kitty and you can leave them on their own for so long.
1786589	1789012	Well, you can do that with the kid later on, but not right now.
1790474	1791295	That's true, that's true.
1792457	1792817	So...
1793638	1794198	DarkSakura, Delorean
1817416	1818317	So that was kind of fun.
1818798	1825585	And then also I did play a little bit of the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
1826846	1829549	I just played one ranked match and did the tutorial.
1830490	1830851	It's all right.
1830911	1832713	I mean, it is similar to the Smash Brothers.
1832873	1838058	But the problem with that game, I mean, playing with four people that I don't know, it's very chaotic.
1838139	1838419	I mean...
1839760	1842202	I don't really know any of the characters' moves or anything.
1842262	1848405	The tutorial doesn't really... It just basically tells you, okay, this button's a hit, this button's to throw people.
1849166	1849446	Go.
1849506	1850847	And you kind of have to figure it all out.
1850927	1852428	How long is that thing going for?
1852448	1854048	Because I have yet to jump on board.
1854108	1854689	Ten more days.
1855129	1856189	Okay, so I've still got some time.
1856310	1858010	Yeah, so you've got time on that.
1858030	1860471	Maybe during break I'll go set the PS3 up to download that.
1860691	1862532	It's not on... Well, yeah, PlayStation Plus, I guess.
1862572	1863372	Yeah, you can do that.
1863492	1864713	Yeah, I have PS Plus.
1865773	1869655	And, of course, it's cross-play, so you can play against people that have the PS3 version and stuff.
1871836	1872836	What else did I do?
1872856	1876518	That was pretty much it.
1876938	1879439	I worked a little bit more on the whole DDR stuff.
1879459	1880780	I keep thinking about it, and I'm...
1888651	1893714	All right.
1894014	1894615	My gaming week.
1894635	1896576	I'll try to be quick because I know we're running long tonight.
1896656	1899857	But there's some new things I want to talk about.
1900037	1901398	First, let me get the old out of the way.
1901538	1904480	I've been playing more World of Warcraft, Mr. Pandaria.
1904620	1906061	And while I overall do...
1907187	1910708	And while overall I do love fucking pandas
1933188	1933769	Good lord.
1934910	1935690	My gaming week.
1937112	1939494	Yes, I played Mists of Pandaria or whatever you want to call it.
1939514	1940035	And here's the thing.
1940075	1944058	As much as I love the expansion, dailies are going to drive me fucking insane.
1944078	1944879	You're a bitch.
1945160	1946861	I'm done with dailies.
1947181	1950385	And if you want to get the best gear in the game, you've got to do the dailies.
1950445	1951426	And I'm so over it.
1951846	1952587	That's all I want to say.
1953887	1954387	Mass Effect 3.
1955187	1961088	Despite DarkSakura's issues, I'm actually able to play even though it will take me like five minutes to connect.
1961188	1964309	Finally, it will connect on PC.
1964449	1966229	I need to play more on Xbox 360.
1966269	1966769	I really do.
1967249	1971890	I can't believe the days are here where it's easier to do it on Xbox Live than it is the PC, but believe it.
1974771	1982212	I've been really enjoying this expansion content and even though the collectors are such assholes, like every time they show up as the enemy, you're like,
1982793	1983916	Oh god, why?
1984537	1985038	Oh god.
1985339	1987144	Praetorians are such dicks.
1988166	1989309	Oh god, he's possessed.
1990751	2017931	But otherwise, Mass Effect 3 is great So let's talk about new stuff One game that I know y'all probably saw the review on Vognetwork.com of And if you haven't seen it yet, you should go Like, go check out Vognetwork Because not only am I reviewing games But we've got reviews up of TV shows and comic books And audio dramas Everything geek you can think of It's there at Vognetwork.com And there's plenty more coming throughout next week And so forth So make it a habit to check every day, okay?
2018411	2020593	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2043488	2048030	And, you know, when you boot the game, it's do you want to go to the main menu or do you want to just start the party?
2048310	2052311	And when I'm talking party mode, I'm talking pretty good mix of multiplayer things.
2052651	2056013	You know, the two people dancing at the same time that you're used to.
2056473	2064016	This whole dance battle tournament style thing where, you know, the crew battle where you can set it up with like eight people, I think, can all do this.
2064556	2064996	Or just...
2065296	2068118	Jump in, jump out, high five, play.
2068678	2070299	It's really smart the way they did it.
2070920	2072321	And I think it's going to get even better.
2072361	2084649	It's unfortunate I couldn't see the game's full, full potential right now because Smart Glass, it's supposed to be one of the first games that's going to support the Smart Glass where while people are dancing on the couch, maybe you're not the type that wants to get up and dance.
2084689	2088111	Well, you can sit there on the couch and control what songs are coming up next through Smart Glass.
2088431	2090372	So I think that's a pretty neat use of it.
2090452	2090813	You know, it's...
2091973	2094436	using the technology wisely without whoring it.
2094456	2096157	And I think that's a smart way to do it.
2097799	2103724	So yeah, there's a lot of good stuff in Dance Central 3, especially when it comes to multiplayer.
2103784	2104345	Oh, the mimic.
2105046	2107608	You can do a dance move and then your partner has to mimic it too.
2107628	2108129	That's kind of neat.
2108869	2109690	Solo stuff.
2110591	2114515	When it comes to the solo stuff, it's kind of what you know already.
2114575	2116277	I mean, there's only so much one person can do.
2116417	2120481	However, there is a comprehensive new story mode in the game.
2121602	2123044	I thought it was a little silly.
2123464	2125987	Some people will enjoy its over-the-topness mode.
2126307	2129911	I was a little bit like, alright, why am I playing this mode again?
2129931	2133796	Because I'd rather would just like choose the songs I want to do and dance to it.
2134336	2136639	And to give the game credit, I can do that.
2136679	2138461	I can just go into the dance mode to do it.
2138821	2141565	But I did kind of sit there going, oh, it's kind of a
2142285	2144946	This mode is actually put together really nicely.
2145026	2146847	It's kind of a shame it's so silly.
2147367	2156109	But, you know, I liked the concept that you were traveling through the decades because it really gave it a comprehensive song list.
2156310	2163552	But to give you an idea how silly it was, you find yourself in Dance Central Intelligence...
2164252	2169837	DCI, and they send you back in time to find the dance moves of the evil guy.
2170037	2170878	It's silly.
2171258	2176863	But it was a good excuse to put things like YMCA and some of the 70s classics are there.
2177143	2178564	I actually thought the 70s... Did we get The Hustle?
2179045	2180306	Yes, The Hustle is in the game.
2180366	2181387	Oh my god, I have to play it.
2181407	2182488	Do you know what song is in the game?
2182628	2183529	You will lose your shit.
2183549	2183949	Car Wash?
2183989	2184930	To represent the 80s.
2185390	2185550	What?
2185891	2187212	Let the music play...
2187732	2188213	Ice Ice Baby
2204352	2205634	You know he's 45 now.
2205774	2206154	Oh God.
2206274	2207075	Vanilla Ice is 45.
2207416	2209938	Hangin' Tough or one of the new Kids on the Block songs is in there.
2210499	2212581	This is silly, silly shit.
2212641	2220630	Okay, so as much as you can look at that and laugh and whatever, when you get into the modern stuff, I was not a big, big fan of the modern stuff they picked.
2221652	2223474	You know, but they, here's the problem.
2224554	2228956	Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2 had such good song lists when it came to contemporary stuff.
2228996	2230936	There was really slim pickings for three.
2230996	2237059	I mean, some of the newer, like they have moves like Jagger and the J-Lo song and, you know, some of them are represented.
2237119	2242521	But it didn't feel as modern club as Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2.
2242721	2246702	But the good news, of course, if you own the prior games, you import the song list for 400 Microsoft points.
2247042	2251424	You don't have to pay it again for number one if you already imported one into two, which is great.
2251964	2253964	So, yeah.
2254084	2256665	Overall, I ended up giving the game a B-plus on VOG Network.
2257265	2267727	The strengths, of course, were the party mode, the instant stuff, the fact that I felt like there were more things to do in Part 3 from Part 2 than there were from Part 1 to Part 2.
2268867	2269087	Mm-hmm.
2270067	2270247	What?
2270627	2271627	Was there a gay dancing mode?
2273288	2274328	Funny you should bring that up.
2274388	2279429	You know, if you play Dance Central 2, a lot of the dances are very, shall we say, feminine?
2279709	2279809	Yeah.
2281128	2282570	Dance Central 3, I wasn't feeling that.
2282730	2285052	And maybe a big part of that has to do with the song list.
2285332	2286653	Although there was one song.
2286693	2287173	What was it?
2287333	2293238	Oh.
2298623	2299283	You know that song?
2299704	2304788	You have to do these little moves called seduce and things where you're basically smacking your ass and all this stuff.
2304848	2307350	That was still a little bit gay dancing.
2307410	2308951	But I liked it a little bit.
2309572	2309652	Yeah.
2310248	2312229	And plus, nothing is more hilarious.
2312349	2312809	I'm sorry.
2312909	2313869	I don't care who you are.
2314069	2316230	We're going to have some real talk right now about Dance Central.
2316630	2330174	Nothing is more hilarious than when you get to that freestyle section of the song where it takes 16 pictures of you or whatever really fast to run up to the camera and start booty popping and then turn around just in time to see your butt back on the screen.
2330214	2330614	Come on.
2331374	2332294	You know you've all tried it.
2332534	2333574	No, I have not.
2333594	2334575	Then you need to try it.
2334755	2335155	It's fun.
2335855	2339918	I still think, though, that nothing is as wonderful as watching you play the ABBA.
2340819	2346222	Oh, yeah, that's the sad thing, is that the 70s, unfortunately, did not have ABBA to represent them.
2346242	2351406	But I always thought Sony had the lock on ABBA because of SingStar, but then Ubisoft had that You Can Dance game.
2351426	2353447	So I don't know, I guess I'm not going to hold my breath.
2353687	2355809	I'm not going to hold my breath for Dance Central to get the rights to it.
2356149	2356589	It's all right.
2357110	2357450	It's all right.
2358190	2359231	So there you go.
2360412	2363134	Acidic Vampire in chat says, yes, but can I bend and snap?
2363154	2364735	You can do whatever you want in freestyle mode.
2367216	2369900	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I've never tried that.
2370241	2372705	I've also never fucked pandas like Rob has.
2372805	2374227	Hey, hey, shut up.
2376170	2378033	All right, what else new can I talk about?
2378194	2381339	Oh, I went into GameStop this week.
2383460	2386662	I was there and I had this impulse.
2387983	2393487	I had to have LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation Vita right now.
2393507	2394608	I wasn't going to wait for Amazon.
2394648	2395609	I had to go get it right now.
2395669	2396289	I understand that.
2396369	2398291	So why didn't you just buy it digitally?
2398551	2398971	You know what?
2399912	2407057	Because I don't like... That worked out for me getting Mass Effect 3 because I was impatient and actually got him to go down to the Amazon price.
2407077	2407658	Yeah.
2409339	2410860	I ended up buying it.
2411180	2417562	But not only did I go into GameStop to buy that game, but they had a Wii U demo unit up and running.
2417902	2418923	So check that.
2418963	2422944	I think these things are starting to show up at your Best Buys and GameStops and where have you.
2423504	2425525	So if you want to get your hands on the Wii U, you can do that.
2426186	2426666	I was surprised.
2426686	2427366	I'll say this much.
2427546	2454893	I don't want to get into the whole Wii U debate thing again because we're already running long but I will say this much I was surprised those tablets were a lot bigger than I was giving it credit for because in my mind I'm thinking oh that thing is kind of like the bottom part of a 3DS or whatever so I was thinking it was going to be like I didn't think it would be that small but I didn't think it would be that big either so I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the Wii U pad otherwise there wasn't a lot on the demo unit to really get a feel for the system the only thing you could play was the Rayman's
2455573	2456534	What was I going to say?
2456574	2457695	So was the controller comfortable?
2457755	2457895	I mean...
2481201	2482101	I thought it was fine.
2482121	2488483	I didn't really hold it for very long because Alan did the playing of the demo, but I thought it was fine.
2488663	2491263	It's like bigger than a PlayStation Vita.
2491363	2493063	I mean, you do have to kind of get used to it.
2493103	2496004	It's like holding this small little laptop in your hands.
2496644	2497924	It's almost bigger than this.
2498485	2501545	It's slightly bigger than this, and I'm pointing at this laptop.
2501565	2502165	The Dell Mini 10.
2502925	2503866	DarkSakura's using what?
2504086	2504706	The Dell Mini 10.
2505186	2505426	Yeah.
2505786	2507266	So, anyway.
2507366	2509967	I apparently just got an answer from EA about my...
2511498	2513493	Stupid Mass Effect thing, so I'm going to check it.
2514151	2515892	Are you going to try playing Mass Effect right now during the show?
2515912	2516973	No, I can't play on the netbook.
2516993	2517713	I was going to say.
2517793	2519714	That'll make that thing implode if you try to do that.
2519814	2520875	All right.
2521015	2521855	It won't make it implode.
2521876	2523897	It'll just melt into a puddle of for fuck's sake.
2524557	2528519	Nate4322 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, would you buy it?
2528599	2529660	I'm thinking about getting one.
2530620	2532882	I'm probably going to get one because I'm a consumer whore.
2533222	2534723	I didn't pre-order one, though.
2535023	2535303	And how?
2535323	2542988	So unless I can get the hookup, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, through friends, I may be shit out of luck.
2543008	2543668	You can do what I did.
2543968	2544188	What?
2544489	2545530	Wait in line outside Target.
2546231	2546631	All night.
2547132	2548733	Oh yeah, Target didn't do pre-orders.
2548773	2549855	We bribed our way into the line.
2550515	2550796	Yeah.
2551416	2558204	I was going to say that, well, if Rayman Legends is your type of game, you're not getting it at launch.
2560620	2561641	It's coming out in March now.
2563223	2563583	All right.
2563603	2574494	But hey, that's Launch Window because, you know, Launch Window is like this, you know, if Nintendo has windows that large, I mean, shit, I'm surprised they haven't gotten broken into.
2574714	2575375	All right, you.
2575835	2577277	We're not debating the Wii U tonight.
2578337	2580958	I will talk about, though, LittleBigPlanet Vita briefly.
2581238	2585520	I haven't been able to spend a whole lot of time with it, but I will say I'm pleasantly surprised with it so far.
2585940	2589302	It really does feel like I'm playing LittleBigPlanet 2 on the go.
2589622	2592823	The game looks really nice, and the new touch mechanic, pretty cool.
2593203	2594964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2621591	2622191	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2636559	2663369	but the one other thing I'll say about it that I actually liked compared to LittleBigPlanet 2 is that it did not default to let's go online and play with strangers yay like no it defaults to play by yourself and if you want to do that you can but you don't like it's not being shoved down your throat to do that so I'm I was very happy about that that already has me liking it almost a little more than LittleBigPlanet 2 although I do love LittleBigPlanet 2
2664537	2664777	All right.
2665597	2668899	We're going to get into gaming news already, but first, some quick housekeeping.
2669259	2678243	Twitter.com slash OLR and, of course, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to be our friend on various social networks.
2679464	2680304	I think that's really it.
2680484	2683625	The award nomination stuff is all over now.
2683665	2687327	We're just waiting to hear if enough of you nominated, and we'll find out.
2687367	2689988	I think Stitcher's stuff goes up tomorrow, so we'll see.
2690328	2691389	We'll let you know on the next show.
2691989	2692830	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2714211	2729655	and, um, also, I guess they, uh, had already laid off 10,000 people earlier this year and, uh, I guess just trying to, you know, make up some of the lost money that they've had because, uh, they're trying to, I guess, save $378 million annually.
2734349	2734970	Thanks for watching!
2745485	2751550	Funny enough, somebody asked me earlier, we were playing that clip about the tester and all that earlier in the show.
2751610	2754873	Somebody asked me, do you know if there's going to be a tester for The Answer?
2754993	2756434	Yes, I actually can answer that for you.
2756474	2758435	The answer is no, there's not going to be a tester for.
2758476	2763159	And the reason why, it actually has nothing to do with the quality of the show or whatever, or whatever easy joke you want to make.
2763580	2768604	Remember when all those layoffs happened at Santa Monica Studio that majorly hit the PR department in that area?
2769744	2771286	The people who did the tester were let go.
2771966	2772327	Whatcha gonna do?
2772347	2772387	Um...
2794724	2796005	So yeah, that kind of sucks.
2796045	2806293	Also, they're saying that they are going to be letting go 840 employees as part of their lens factory in Minocomo.
2808374	2815400	Because, you know, they do make Blu-ray players and CD players and DVD players and cameras.
2816600	2817241	Lots of lenses.
2820649	2830379	Well, do you think this has to... Is this the usual ebb and flow of what we see happening at game companies where projects end and people get let go?
2830979	2838206	Or do you want to go so far as to make the argument that the PlayStation 3's performance or lack thereof is to blame for this?
2838226	2839147	I think it's neither of that.
2839187	2843972	I think all it is is just that they're maybe suffering losses in other areas.
2844492	2845113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2865210	2867212	Maybe they just don't have work for these people.
2867552	2873295	Or they decided, hey, we don't need a reality show that kind of is alright, I guess.
2873755	2875957	And it's costing us a lot of money to put this out.
2876257	2883041	And really, we're not seeing much of a return on people signing up for PlayStation Plus.
2883081	2884902	Although I don't think that was exclusive to PlayStation Plus.
2884942	2887964	But we don't have people coming to our network because of the tester.
2888404	2892707	So let's just cut some costs there and let's give people free games instead for PlayStation Plus.
2893167	2897190	Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, do you think the people who won on the tester also got laid off?
2897230	2898671	Can Sony lay off game testers?
2898731	2899632	Well, yes, they can.
2900192	2906096	And actually, go back and listen to the show that had Asuka was on the show when that was new.
2906176	2908218	It ended up being the week before she was kicked off.
2908678	2915163	But she said that they would get everybody hyped up about the prize and then the cameras would cut.
2915583	2917965	Just so you guys know, it's a six-month contract.
2918325	2921407	So technically, Sony was never under any obligation to hire those people.
2921627	2923147	Didn't we talk about it like a couple weeks ago?
2923188	2933791	There was the guy that, I think it was the first guy that won, and he came out like smashing, like totally dissonant on a bunch of stuff, like talking about how they've made mistakes, you know, left and right with their properties.
2933831	2934191	Did they?
2934331	2934931	I don't know.
2934991	2936191	I don't think we talked about that here.
2936412	2937692	Yeah, I remember reading that.
2938072	2939214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2954533	2958737	And also, you know... He got into PR, so he might have... I mean, I don't know.
2958757	2959278	I can't speak for the guy.
2959298	2961580	Another thing to consider, too, is all these layoffs are in Japan.
2961700	2963421	There's nothing in the U.S.
2963461	2966724	But we did have the PR layoffs that happened just not that long ago.
2967124	2970627	I don't know what would have happened with the third guy that won because he was a very recent winner.
2970727	2973870	But most of these guys... And he was an associate producer, right?
2973910	2976733	Yeah, he was probably under contract somewhere or something.
2976793	2976973	So...
2977453	2981115	and as ShadowNextGen in chat says, any company can lay off anyone.
2981195	2982276	That's absolutely right.
2982796	2983537	So who knows?
2983837	2984137	Who knows?
2984197	2984777	Been there, done that.
2985978	2986178	Yep.
2986938	2987199	All right.
2987899	2988960	Let's move on with more news.
2989780	2992982	Good luck to those that were impacted by this.
2993022	2994663	This is never any fun to report on.
2995383	2999566	But hey, I'll use this as an opportunity to plug Bobby's show from tonight.
2999586	3001907	He had a great interview tonight with a game recruiter.
3003107	3026637	and who was very motivational about how to you know kind of be resilient about what happens when you get laid off and kind of what not to do and I found that very interesting because he was very honest so I'm not going to give it all away though you have to go check that out Bobby Blackwolf show which will be posted to vognetwork.com at some point this week or look him up on Stitcher as well Bobby Blackwolf let's talk about Zynga real quick
3028234	3031875	So, Zynga is having a very interesting year.
3031995	3040017	Their stock, their games, and now people seem to be abandoning ship left and right.
3040877	3043738	And one of these people that's left is getting sued.
3044298	3047018	And it's the former Cityville general manager.
3047279	3050439	I didn't even realize there was a game called Cityville, but I guess that makes sense.
3051660	3053940	The guy's name is Alan Patmore.
3054660	3057301	And in this lawsuit, Zynga believes...
3057987	3067457	The Alan Patmore uploaded company assets to a Dropbox account from his company computer both on the day before and day of his departure from the company.
3067477	3068238	Well, that's a no-no.
3069139	3080190	That would be information on Zynga's game mechanics, Cityville's performance assessments, monetization plans, emails, design documents, including an unreleased game design document.
3081071	3095759	So, Mr. Patmore went to a social game company called Kick's Eye, and Zynga is alleging, again, we can't say he did it, we don't know, but Zynga's alleging in these documents that he is going to use this information to directly compete with Zynga.
3096279	3108426	A quote from the lawsuit, "...could be used to improve a competitor's internal understanding and know-how of core game mechanics and monetization techniques, its execution, and ultimately its market standing to compete more effectively with Zynga."
3109386	3113128	Pat Moore apparently refused to sign a termination certification.
3113488	3117430	They're saying this reaffirmed all of this information.
3118210	3123593	They're trying to block Pat Moore and his company from accessing the data and they want it back.
3124713	3135457	Kixi, in an interview with All Things Digital, said they have nothing to do with the suit, but apparently they slipped this thing in at Zynga.
3135537	3145201	Quote, unfortunately, this appears to be Zynga's new employee retention strategy, suing former employees to scare current employees into staying.
3146281	3146562	Hmm.
3148302	3152503	It's one thing to take company typefaces that were designed for the company.
3174069	3175591	Another thing to take game mechanics.
3175791	3177754	Yeah, it's kind of different.
3177874	3180597	Well, it's still not appropriate.
3180837	3182779	I can't help it if they had pretty font, okay?
3184081	3191409	But still, I mean, let's say that if you did design work at the company, what's appropriate for you to take with you in master files?
3191710	3194513	Technically, you did it on the company clock, so they belong to the company.
3194873	3195293	That's true.
3195914	3200297	But there is, you can keep your own work for the sake of your portfolio.
3200317	3209543	I was just about to say, now, surely you can have like a PDF for your portfolio or whatever, but you don't get to keep... If it's stuff this guy designed, then he's entitled to retain a copy for himself.
3209583	3210944	He just can't use it elsewhere.
3211104	3218529	Yeah, but if we're talking about information on Zynga's game mechanics, assessments of the performance, that's not one person.
3218589	3223992	So what you're saying is he had a copy of Tiny Towers on his computer that he uploaded to the Dropbox, right?
3228114	3231955	So, yeah, I'm... I don't know.
3232096	3243019	Zynga... We're going to get into this a little later when we get to the Google Question of the Week, but I'm very interested to see where Zynga ends up in a few years because it really seems like that company is... It's abandoned ship fast over there.
3243780	3244140	I don't know.
3244720	3244860	So...
3246403	3248666	I kind of point and laugh at them every time I'm in San Francisco.
3265285	3266686	While I'm at it, fuck Facebook.
3266946	3268706	Do you know I couldn't use the Facebook?
3268866	3271287	You know how like Facebook has a separate camera application?
3271747	3272868	It would not let me use it.
3272928	3276309	It says location services are required to use this application.
3277149	3278449	I said fuck you and deleted it.
3278469	3280090	I'll just use Instagram where it's optional.
3282000	3311180	and like every time I turn location stuff off on Facebook and I've talked about this before if I want to advertise where I am I'll use Foursquare otherwise I don't see the need to always post every place I'm at including my home address so turn it off but it just keeps magically coming back on on Facebook I'm about ready to go back to Google Plus I'm about ready to just delete Facebook but I've threatened that about four times on this show and I haven't done it yet so I need to put my money where my mouth is I guess
3311661	3314382	On top of that, Facebook has turned into Attention Horse Central.
3315502	3316262	Pay attention to me.
3316543	3317223	Pay attention to me.
3318663	3320944	Facebook does exist on the internet.
3321824	3324145	Let's pay attention to your story, DarkSakura.
3324165	3325705	This is awesome because it's Sega.
3326726	3327086	Sega!
3329327	3331769	I'm sure you've all heard of the Model 2 arcade board, right?
3332229	3333109	There's some great games on it.
3333750	3336351	Virtua Fighter, well I won't say Virtua Fighter was great because I hate Virtua Fighter.
3336371	3337492	I thought you said great games.
3337972	3340874	Yeah, well there's a lot of people who are fans of Virtua Fighter 2.
3341535	3343776	I only played that game to try to knock Kage's mask off.
3345177	3347398	Sonic Fighters, Sonic the Fighters was great.
3348018	3350220	And one of my favorite ever games, Virtual Lawn.
3351601	3365411	Well, there's going to be an Xbox Live Arcade and a PlayStation Network, which is a release game that's a Model 2 collection, Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers, Cyber Trooper Virtual Lawn, Virtua Striker, and Sonic the Fighters.
3368133	3371075	I'll tell you what my experience with Sonic the Fighters is, is Fighters Megamix.
3372076	3376279	You could also play as the car from Daytona and beat people up with a car.
3376519	3376679	Yes.
3379381	3380902	Which I believe is another Model 2 game, right?
3381442	3381622	Yes.
3382062	3383522	No, it was Home Only.
3383683	3384883	That already came out anyway.
3385363	3388624	Daytona was... No, Daytona was Model 2.
3388664	3389945	I was thinking Fighter's Megamix.
3389965	3390565	I understand, yes.
3390605	3391885	It's already released that already a long time ago.
3391905	3392385	I understand.
3393106	3394486	It's still another excuse to play this song.
3395567	3402289	Anyway, it's going to be... For Japan pricing anyway, it's 800 Microsoft points or 10 bucks.
3402429	3405710	I'm sure we're going to get it, so... Yay.
3406850	3407871	We need a Fighter's Megamix 2.
3409005	3410487	Fighters Megamix was so much fun.
3411589	3413691	It's just the fun thing about playing as a car.
3415113	3415814	I'm a car.
3416595	3416996	Punch.
3418178	3419539	Sonic versus car.
3420601	3421322	That was great.
3421822	3422283	Good times.
3422403	3422644	Okay.
3424975	3429818	I was just thinking, I saw a Robot Chicken clip this week of Street Fighter.
3430458	3441164	And they were... It was basically Ryu, I guess, telling people what to do as far as... He was scheduling all their fights and stuff.
3441684	3443225	And one of the fights was...
3444045	3446546	Ken, he's all, I thought I was supposed to be fighting E-Honda.
3446806	3447547	No, I'm sorry.
3447787	3449468	That says you're fighting A-Honda.
3449748	3450928	So, this is stupid.
3451148	3452609	Why would I want to fight a car?
3452889	3453790	Just punch the car.
3453910	3454250	Okay.
3454570	3455310	He starts punching the car.
3455471	3456751	Hey, this is actually kind of cool.
3457792	3459773	So, it was like the bonus round?
3459813	3460913	Yeah, it was the bonus round.
3460933	3461633	That's pretty cool.
3461653	3463034	That was great.
3463454	3468937	Anyways, so, let's talk a little bit about some cool stuff.
3469057	3470618	And, you know, we always talk about...
3471178	3495761	Holiday or not holiday holodeck gaming as like kind of the you know oh my god everything we've ever done in gaming has been taking us one step closer to the holodeck because we were always like oh my like remember when we were kids and we all saw mode 7 for the first time like pilot wings and stuff and it's like oh my god this blows my fucking mind Dracula X on Super Nintendo like
3496521	3497802	The fire's moving!
3514630	3515631	Kind of saying the same thing.
3515671	3519434	Imagine the spectrum of what's possible in the computing world.
3521116	3527000	Basically, look at how fast everything is progressing, how the engines are getting bigger and bigger.
3527561	3533245	The real exciting thing is about the people, the relationships, and the business involved and how they're working together.
3534166	3535387	Obviously, there's going to be...
3536508	3545292	You know, better simulations, better... And, I mean, if you think about it, look at how far things have gone in just the last, like, 20 years, 30 years.
3545332	3547173	I mean, it's just been, like, holy crap.
3547313	3551496	Well, yeah, I mean, Super Nintendo was 1990 when that came out.
3551536	3554237	So, like, 92 would have been right at the height of, like, Super Nintendo.
3554397	3556818	Yeah, I mean... We're 20 years since then.
3556838	3556998	20 years.
3557118	3558939	Can you imagine what 20 years from now is going to be?
3558959	3560540	It's like, fuck, yeah.
3560620	3561240	Or what did the Ultra H...
3566428	3569689	Well now there's you'll get to make out with Garrus for real.
3570709	3574170	There's Ultra HD now is that new thing right?
3574190	3582251	Because I was reading on the internet this week that's the now approved 4K is now Ultra HD or whatever so that's what we have to look forward to and you know 3D is already a thing.
3582571	3588532	I'm sure it's just a matter of time before you have an environment where you can have TVs on three walls so you can like look all around you and see things in 3D.
3588572	3590713	I mean that's where we're going to be at in 20 years.
3590753	3596254	That would basically be the Microsoft thing that they have with their projectors and stuff what we were talking about before.
3596890	3625033	they actually are doing holographic television I was watching a special on it just like a month ago and you want to know what kind of creeps me out like now that I have an iPhone 5 you know what kind of creeps me out a little bit Siri like for real like Siri kind of creeps me out a little bit because like I can tell it open the pod bay doors yeah she's a little slow that's a rather insensitive thing to say to an intelligent agent
3626495	3628017	See, but like she does shit like that.
3628057	3630459	Like the other day, or no, no, this is earlier.
3630519	3632541	Like just earlier today, I hit the little button.
3632561	3634622	I said, Siri, wake me up in 30 minutes.
3634783	3635443	And she goes, okay.
3635483	3637865	I set the alarm for, you know, 440 or whatever it was.
3638266	3640488	And then I just out of habit, I went, thank you.
3640528	3640968	That's it.
3641228	3643010	And she goes, I live to serve.
3643030	3647474	And I'm like, I just talked to my iPhone.
3647514	3647814	Really?
3647854	3648515	You live to serve.
3648655	3649396	Are you programmed?
3649436	3650997	Have you ever told Siri goodnight?
3651517	3652118	No, I never had.
3652138	3653099	Goodnight to you too.
3654389	3660351	See, we're getting a little closer to this Cylon thing that has me a little bit worried.
3663711	3666312	Artificial intelligence has really taken off in 20 years too.
3666352	3667132	That's all I'm saying.
3667793	3670753	Can you imagine that type of interaction in a Mass Effect type of game?
3671153	3671814	It's crazy.
3672154	3673494	How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
3675295	3675815	No one cares.
3676515	3676755	Hush.
3678495	3680776	Just because it could doesn't mean that it would.
3684468	3688009	Why can't it just say, stop fucking wasting my time with stupid and mean questions?
3690669	3693030	Doesn't she get offended if you go like, fuck you or whatever?
3693710	3695150	You are entitled to your opinion.
3695430	3697170	Or, this is about you, not about me.
3698030	3699131	That one's my favorite.
3699171	3702491	You can also, though, ask her how to make meth and it'll pull up the chemical formula.
3702911	3707852	What if you go up to her and you go, hey, how you doing?
3708672	3709392	You know, like friends.
3711453	3712053	How you doing?
3713649	3714350	I'm testing it out.
3717492	3718533	Siri's thinking about it.
3720094	3721194	Beep, beep.
3722215	3722515	Okay.
3722675	3723656	Wow, that was boring.
3723756	3724457	Let me try one here.
3726018	3727759	Where could I score some marijuana?
3730421	3731402	Sorry, Rob.
3731702	3732863	I don't have that schedule.
3734004	3734624	Schedule?
3735325	3736025	Yes, I'm sorry.
3736045	3738467	You can't take the train to Marijuana Town.
3739007	3740668	I like this one.
3741809	3742790	Where can I hide a body?
3746181	3748003	What kind of place are you looking for?
3748603	3757051	Funeral services, mortuaries, swamps, metal foundries, cremation services, reservoirs, mines, or dumps.
3759334	3760314	Metal foundries?
3760334	3762176	What is this, Terminator?
3762196	3763558	Alright, turn that bitch off.
3763658	3764098	I'm sorry.
3764338	3765880	It's funny.
3766040	3766600	Where were we?
3766741	3767301	Holodeck.
3768522	3769743	How can I stop Skynet?
3771215	3776677	Anyways, so holodeck gaming, of course it's always going to be the goal.
3777097	3787359	And I think that it seems to be the whole 3D is coming back, the whole VR stuff is almost coming back a little bit with that Oculus Rift stuff.
3787880	3792761	And of course more of the haptic technologies are kind of taking off.
3793041	3795642	I'm sure in 10 years time we'll have...
3796522	3800485	You know, some pretty interesting interactions with the computers.
3800505	3801746	It's going to become more seamless.
3801766	3810473	You know, it's just like, you know, if you think about it now, you know, like 30 years ago, someone told you, yeah, you're going to be carrying around computers with you.
3810653	3816217	You know, like everybody's like had that whole futuristic fantasy of like a wristwatch computer thing.
3816257	3817278	But look at it.
3817298	3820441	You've got like an HD screen in the palm of your hand.
3820821	3823283	It's basically better than what you...
3824524	3829709	20 years ago, you had a 40 megabyte drive in your computer and that was like Uber storage for everything.
3830150	3835935	Now you can store what, like almost a thousand times that in a little tiny chip in your hand?
3836416	3837097	It's crazy.
3837657	3840400	It's going to be interesting.
3840987	3844089	Well, I'm glad that our game developers are already thinking about the holodeck.
3844350	3845451	I think that's a good sign.
3845711	3847492	Too bad it doesn't matter because the world's going to end this.
3847512	3848813	No, I'm just kidding.
3849514	3851555	No one believes that, except for crazy people.
3854157	3854478	All right.
3854518	3859261	Well, one thing that the holodeck may not have in it is Facebook and Twitter.
3859722	3862304	That's because Microsoft is doing away with it.
3862364	3867288	In their fall 2012 update, Twitter and Facebook are going to be gone from the dashboard.
3867348	3870010	These apps are officially being retired.
3870550	3870730	All right.
3870810	3871351	Let's be real, though.
3871371	3873232	Everybody's talking about this on the Internet.
3873252	3874373	Everybody's mentioning this.
3894549	3898534	I bet if they had just deleted them, a lot of you would have never known.
3898574	3901958	Because seriously, when was the last time you used Twitter on your Xbox?
3902279	3904401	I'll tell you when you used Twitter on your Xbox.
3904842	3911390	You loaded it up the first day it came out and wrote a tweet that said, Hi from my Xbox 360 LOL butts goodbye.
3912331	3913653	And that was probably the last time you did it.
3914333	3924736	So instead of making Twitter and Facebook so terribly difficult to use in the Xbox 360, why couldn't they have implemented it into the dashboard?
3925176	3927777	Oh, because that would have taken too much work.
3929277	3931338	Because before it was like, okay, you had to exit out of your game.
3931498	3938540	You had to exit out of all this other stuff to see information on Twitter or Facebook.
3939000	3945962	But Windows Messenger, you can get messages on that and you can see them pop up.
3946343	3953785	But why can't you just have the same thing on the dashboard for the Xbox 360 where you can pop it up immediately, just hit the guide button or something like that and see that.
3953865	3955145	Oh, because that would be too much work.
3955426	3959567	We want you to use our shitty fucking internet browser, Internet Explorer.
3960267	3968893	If a console really wanted to be cutting edge, you should be able to press one button and get a menu and hit Facebook and your feed comes right up.
3968973	3975237	None of this loading time, none of this going out of the app, it needs to be embedded or it's useless.
3975357	3983482	I think it's also kind of stupid that, well, I mean, I'm sure they're proud of Internet Explorer, but no one's like, fuck yeah, I get to use Internet Explorer on my Xbox.
3984022	3986284	Just call it the Xbox web browser.
3986304	3990508	I mean, because Internet Explorer doesn't mean fucking kick-ass.
3990548	3992650	It means fucking garbage is what it means.
3993271	3996454	Because Microsoft is not going to give up on their branding, end of story.
3996754	4002200	It's basically the thing I use to go fucking download Firefox or Google Chrome.
4002220	4008566	You know, I use it the one time when I load in my operating system to download that fucking program if I don't already have it on Jump Drive.
4008906	4010947	Okay, now here's the thing.
4010967	4012628	I will say this about the Facebook application.
4012648	4016509	There's one thing that I did think was very useful about that Facebook application.
4016989	4023212	You could go in and you could instantly see what your friends, your people on Facebook, what their gamer tags were.
4023732	4029794	So if you were like their friend on Facebook and they connected to the Xbox, you could see their gamer tag so you could easily add people to your Xbox friends list.
4030134	4030895	That was useful.
4031295	4033336	I hope they will retain that in some capacity.
4033396	4034456	That's really all I can think of.
4034796	4063713	of course they still have not upped the limit I was just about to say so I can't add anybody else anyway but you know if somebody decides to you know face if somebody decides to Xbox break up with me as this happened in the past then I'll have a couple slots where I can add more people and I would like them to be people I know on Facebook and what have you so let's see Black Wolf in our chat says hey guys remember we could watch videos on our 360 without loading a Zoom video app those were good times
4066425	4068527	They need to make this stuff easier, not more difficult.
4068547	4070028	Their apps thing is kind of dumb.
4071169	4075852	It's what bugs me about Mass Effect 3 on Origin and why I keep giving Origin a bad time.
4076433	4083818	Origin, if you want to get it right, I should be able to load Mass Effect 3 and instantly go into a multiplayer game.
4084018	4084799	Instantly!
4085759	4087380	Not five minutes later.
4087400	4089062	And not have to verify my DLC.
4089162	4089462	Thank you.
4091260	4093221	That's the stuff that's starting to bug me.
4093261	4096223	That's what's going to keep the holodeck from happening.
4096623	4097224	Bullshit.
4097564	4099725	Bullshit is going to stop the holodeck from happening.
4100025	4104308	Yes, we're headed towards the holodeck, but we are having to go through so much bullshit to get there.
4106990	4110212	I'm sorry, we can't authenticate your person because you've gotten a haircut.
4111312	4111673	Exactly.
4111693	4113974	Come back in two months once your hair has grown out.
4114694	4115375	It's ridiculous.
4117015	4125242	Remember how they were talking about, and I don't even know anybody that would ever do this, where you would leave your Xbox 360 on and Kinect would recognize your face and log you in?
4126403	4133889	Or I can hit the guide button and just log myself in probably infinitely faster than that stupid thing.
4134430	4135771	And I don't have to have Kinect hooked up.
4135971	4141999	SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom says, at live.vognetwork.com says, where is my MySpace or GeoCities app?
4142499	4144342	Didn't GeoCities finally officially close?
4144402	4145063	I think they're gone.
4145123	4146144	It's totally gone.
4146765	4149228	MySpace, however, it's coming back, baby.
4152308	4181050	to be fair I use the Twitter app or I use the Twitter app in Xbox about as often as I use well maybe a couple more times on the Vita but I haven't really used it on the Vita or the Facebook app because I have a phone I mean that's the thing kind of nowadays it's cool they have this integration and weren't they going to have it where you can send like screenshots of your gameplay and stuff like that on Facebook some games have that like NBA 2K13 or whatever why don't we just add that to all games instead of just you know
4181770	4207221	here's the other thing like i'm now gonna access twitter on my phone okay ready tap tap wait there's my feed it's up and it's already refreshed that's how long it took me to get twitter up on my phone that's why i prefer to use my phone because you know how long that would have taken me to do on my vita you know it would have been and then like oh downloading new update but
4208641	4210843	and then like, oh, going to connecting to Twitter.
4212325	4213185	Downloading tweets.
4213906	4215407	Like it doesn't work that fast.
4215568	4216248	That's the problem.
4217569	4218791	Hooray for you getting Twitter.
4218851	4219791	Now make it work better.
4220892	4222394	So anyway.
4224434	4226897	Let's move on with DarkSakura.
4226977	4234206	Actually, real quick, I was going to say it's even more ironic the fact that they're getting rid of Facebook and Twitter is how integrated that stuff is in Windows 8.
4235368	4241436	Kind of seems a little backwards that we're getting this Windows 8 dashboard thing on the Xbox, and yet they're not having that same type of integrations.
4241536	4246237	Well, maybe they're able to do it instantly on the desktop where they are having that problem on the Xbox for whatever reason.
4246257	4249437	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4249457	4251838	Tangled yarn.
4252158	4253198	Are you knitting during the show?
4253238	4254358	I'm crocheting, thank you.
4254378	4255038	Excuse me, crocheting.
4255178	4259519	But my ball of cheap-ass yarn has got a tangle in it.
4260159	4261560	Never buy yarn from the dollar store.
4262320	4268461	Anyway, how many people liked Elder Scrolls 3 and liked Oblivion?
4269241	4269461	Me.
4269481	4269521	Me.
4270002	4271452	Who liked Kingdoms of Amalur?
4273653	4275294	I didn't play it.
4275874	4276874	I hear it's not bad.
4277935	4279195	I don't think we should give it too much shit.
4279215	4283977	The lead designer for those two Elder Scrolls games, Ken Rolston, jumped ship.
4284457	4291159	He's off with Turbine now, which is the developer for Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons and Dragons Online, which I'm kind of playing low tour.
4292100	4293920	It's pretty.
4294140	4295821	It's got cherry blossoms, so I like it.
4299262	4299843	Basically,
4304079	4317685	I'm trying to see if I can... Yeah, he basically said they're, like, really excited to have him, and I guess that Oblivion... Well, that the Elder Scrolls franchise will just have to keep going with whoever the new people are.
4318206	4320567	Well, he didn't have Skyrim on his resume.
4320587	4320807	No.
4320927	4331412	That game turned out all right, so... But still, I mean, I'm not... This guy, obviously, it's a name I've heard before, and I know he's contributed a lot to these franchises, so I think any company's lucky to have him.
4331672	4332692	And he's wearing a beret.
4332712	4333653	Ha ha ha!
4335310	4336872	which instantly makes somebody awesome.
4337013	4337253	Yes.
4337533	4343822	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games you can look forward to real soon and it is getting to be that time of year, right?
4344123	4346106	It's already been that time of year for a few weeks now.
4346146	4348750	Yeah, I mean like next month is a huge month, right?
4349591	4350091	It's not so bad.
4351052	4352613	But yeah, there's a lot of games coming out.
4352913	4358054	This week, of course, we had Skylanders Giants come out today along with all those wonderful packs and stuff.
4358514	4362156	That was on PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the 3DS and PC.
4364056	4366597	On the Vita this week, we get Street Fighter X Tekken.
4367817	4372299	On PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Medal of Honor Warfighter.
4373479	4376680	On PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013.
4378201	4379561	Also, they have a bundle with this
4379781	4384857	FearMasterGun, it senses your fear your fear of playing a mediocre game but it senses it
4388237	4391640	That should be a gun for Silent Hill or something like that.
4391920	4393761	A fear gun.
4394021	4394502	It's great.
4394622	4395482	It senses your heart.
4395602	4402887	It's basically the Nintendo sensor thing that never came out.
4403327	4404808	Oh, it's the Vitality Sensor.
4404848	4406990	Yes, it's the Vitality Sensor for Cabela's.
4408811	4413014	And then they also have Cabela's Hunting Expeditions on the same systems as well.
4413134	4417037	Maybe that was something that was originally being developed for the Vitality Sensor, but when that kind of went away,
4418237	4418358	No.
4418598	4419218	Alright, maybe not.
4420059	4420479	I tried.
4420559	4423722	Just Dance Disney Party on Xbox 360 and Wii.
4425663	4429787	Zero Escape Virtue's Last Reward on 3DS and the Vita.
4431528	4433409	Let's see what else we got here.
4434730	4438393	Also this week, Myst on the 3DS.
4438433	4439614	I think it's been delayed a few weeks.
4439894	4441015	Hopefully it's coming out this week.
4441516	4445499	Naughty Bear Double Trouble on PS3 and it's both mediocre Naughty Bear games.
4446660	4460238	uh just see here Forza Horizon on Xbox 360 as well as the collector's edition of that um what else we got here uh Super Monkey Ball Banez Splits on the Vita
4461636	4462597	They are still trying, huh?
4462898	4463679	They are trying.
4463879	4467543	Smart as on the... Not smart ass.
4467864	4468685	Smart as.
4469045	4470927	With one S. On the Vita.
4472309	4473230	That's also this week.
4473270	4474752	That's supposed to be a brain training game.
4476995	4477696	Let's see here.
4479117	4482598	They've got some controller kind of game combos.
4482978	4487799	So they're re-releasing the God of War Saga Collection with a red DualShock controller.
4487839	4490819	They also have the Infamous Collection with a metallic blue controller.
4491879	4494380	And what was the last one?
4494420	4498201	It was another one of their collections that they released with a silver controller.
4499261	4499641	I don't remember.
4499841	4500401	It's not important.
4500681	4501761	Those games are already out anyways.
4502281	4504562	And last but not least, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask on the 3DS.
4506576	4507937	Zona of the Enders HD Edition Muvlove
4533670	4537327	There's Muv Love and Muv Love Alternative.
4538920	4541001	out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4541021	4542741	Is that Muv Love or Muff Love?
4543221	4546202	I almost said Muff Love, but it is Muv Love.
4546423	4550344	I want to say it's an anime, but then again, yet again, here we are.
4550364	4550984	I love this.
4551524	4551984	I'm sorry.
4552024	4552745	This is too great.
4552765	4554165	I got to post a screenshot chat.
4554385	4557746	I'm so sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see this, but look this game up.
4557986	4559747	MUV-LUV, okay?
4559807	4560407	Because look at this.
4560827	4568490	You got these Japanese girls in school outfits, da-da-da-da-da, and this one is sucking on a hot dog in the corner, and then what the fuck
4568490	4571412	What the fuck is this bitch down here?
4571512	4575094	She's in a barrel or a bundle of sticks or something.
4577355	4578856	I've got to post that for the chatties.
4578936	4579316	Hold on.
4579336	4579997	There you go.
4580297	4581077	That is amazing.
4581137	4582638	That is absolutely amazing.
4582698	4583058	I love it.
4583458	4585540	Now wait, what's Muv Love Alternative?
4585580	4586920	Is that going to be the one with the dudes on it?
4586960	4587361	Let me see.
4587561	4587841	Hold on.
4589818	4590038	What?
4590879	4592219	This isn't even the same game.
4592300	4592800	Yes, it is.
4593680	4595061	Now it's like chick with the sword.
4595081	4595461	Yeah, I know.
4595501	4598283	It's the same, but that doesn't even look the same at all.
4598503	4599944	So maybe it's like the dark version.
4601365	4603666	Like one's all about love and one's about killing.
4604807	4606908	One's like the cutesy, happy universe.
4606928	4609229	The other's like the cyber baby universe.
4609249	4610250	Okay, I need help.
4610530	4611151	Live chatters.
4612371	4614232	You guys tend to know this stuff when I don't.
4614312	4615593	What is muv love?
4615773	4616674	Somebody tell me.
4617714	4618515	I've got to know now.
4620226	4623568	They don't say a lot about these games on the... It's an adventure game.
4625710	4627531	Like, does that mean... An adventure through panties?
4627631	4628112	Oh, wait, here.
4628272	4629933	Oh, there's a YouTube here.
4630473	4631754	Every anime game ever!
4632255	4634016	I know, that told me nothing.
4634096	4635557	And then, Total Eclipse...
4644503	4646004	Wow, that totally summed it up for me.
4646224	4646524	I know.
4646705	4651608	It's like, oh, it's even bigger, even more love, something.
4652328	4652848	Play it again.
4653109	4654149	No, no, don't play it.
4654189	4655990	Jason says it's a visual novel.
4656110	4657371	Read Japanese porn.
4658552	4666237	Well, and to be fair, that is definitely a bundle of straw and not necessarily a barrel.
4667575	4674258	For the record, I have bought a Japanese digital novel that they had in the US.
4674418	4675879	They put it on Sega CD.
4676199	4676719	Oh, right, right.
4677740	4679941	It was by the guy who created Cobra.
4681902	4686444	PlayStation 3 this week in Japan also gets Heartful Simulator Pachislot to Heart 2.
4687324	4689405	Pachislot means, you know what, pachinko game.
4690217	4717585	Two Hearts Anime Series Dark Souls with Atorias of the Abyss Edition I'm assuming that's the Dark Souls DLC bundled with a regular game Borderlands 2, Bioshock in a 2K collection price reduction I'm assuming gearing up for the sequel next year and Killzone Trilogy also released on the PlayStation 3 again these are all Japanese releases this week on the PlayStation Vita this week Street Fighter X Tekken in Japan as well as Next Rev
4717945	4727191	Kaigo Fukushishi Shiken comes out as well on the Nintendo 3DS this week.
4728911	4730713	AKB48 plus me?
4731033	4731773	Oh, good lord.
4731913	4732954	It's like a little girl group.
4733514	4733954	Oh, is it?
4734175	4744380	Yeah, AKB48 is like this, I guess it's kind of this pop group that keeps cycling in, you know, kind of like Minuto was, you know?
4744461	4744921	Sure, sure.
4745001	4745201	Yeah.
4745581	4746722	Or Morning Musume?
4746742	4746842	Yeah.
4747290	4748171	Yeah, kind of.
4748211	4750153	But Morning Musume was also like a variety show.
4750673	4751194	Oh, right, right.
4751414	4755638	But AKB48, they're like top 40 list everything.
4756278	4756519	Cool.
4757119	4758921	Well, there it is, your Japanese release dates.
4759261	4761063	Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.
4762571	4763752	As soon as I get to the list.
4765353	4765713	Let's see.
4766393	4770316	We have, well, on today, which means it's already yesterday there.
4770676	4772677	I wanted to say it was Cairo, but it's Calro.
4773198	4774238	K-A-L-R-O.
4774839	4780342	Then on the 23rd, there's Hotline Miami, Killzone HD, and Medal of Honor Warfighter.
4780803	4784505	On the 24th, Killzone Trilogy, PlayStation, All-Stars Battle Royale.
4784985	4786806	The 25th, Incredipede.
4788147	4793028	and the 26 Forza Horizon Roller Coaster Tycoon and Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.
4794148	4797069	Not to be confused with the TV show of the same name from the 60s.
4799409	4801770	So, thanks to the chatters, did a little research.
4802170	4806890	Muv Love, it was an adult game on the PC in February of 2003.
4807631	4813412	They redid these with the adult content removed on the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4814252	4814752	I know, right?
4814792	4815352	What's the point?
4816092	4821417	Muv-Luv Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, and then Muv-Luv Alternative came out a little later in 2006.
4821977	4830084	So I'm assuming this is some type of repackaged stuff, or it's like the game's re-revised, up-rezzed, or whatever, reimagining.
4830584	4831545	So, yeah, because...
4833420	4835041	They show later release dates there.
4835121	4836621	October 25th on the PlayStation 3.
4837122	4839403	So I guess this game's been around a little while.
4839643	4840683	I just have never played it.
4840783	4842304	But now I kind of want to.
4842884	4845505	I got to know what the girl in the straw is all about.
4847486	4847746	All right.
4848846	4849167	Let's see.
4849227	4849947	That's release dates.
4849967	4852028	A couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.
4852148	4854028	We have, by the way, been graced with Maruko.
4854609	4855549	Hello, Maruko.
4856129	4857570	Did he finally decide to stop being shy?
4858568	4859409	Let me scratch his butt.
4859709	4860090	Oh, nice.
4860410	4861371	Stick his tail in the air.
4861671	4862372	Look at my butt.
4862432	4864233	That's the closest I've ever seen him get to Loki.
4864253	4865094	He must be getting used to it.
4865554	4868377	All right, anyhow.
4869518	4871720	We interrupt this kitty appearance for more gaming news.
4874022	4876864	All right, so let's talk a little bit about Steam Greenlight.
4876884	4882309	They've got some new games that have been given the go-ahead, and those are 21 new games.
4882549	4883610	And this is kind of cool.
4883670	4885312	Some of these are actually backed on Kickstarter.
4885992	4897816	Um, but see, Afterfall, Insanity, Extended Edition, Air Buccaneers, Blockscape, Contrast, Flyin', Folktale, Forge, The Gianna Sisters, Twisted Dreams, which is Project Gianna, that was the one I backed and it's fucking awesome.
4897836	4898196	Cool.
4898896	4902677	Um, uh, Genorm, Genoria, I guess?
4903737	4904338	Nomoria?
4904518	4905738	No, Nomoria, that's what it was.
4906418	4919021	Interstellar Marines, Lost Story, The Last Days of Earth, Mia Samada, Minor Wars 2081, Neo Tokyo, Octodad, Dadlius Ketch, Perpetuum, Postal 2 Complete, The Secrets of Grindia,
4930304	4944674	The Intruder, The Stanley Parable HD Remix which is also supposed to be a pretty awesome source game and Yogg Ventures those are going to be the 21 new games that they're going to be adding to the Steam store at some point soon
4945314	4954078	And then also, of course, the non-gaming area, which they added recently, is also added to Steam Greenlight as well.
4954098	4960120	So now you can begin voting on submissions for other stuff that's not necessarily software.
4960940	4965102	And I don't know what exactly is on there yet, but I'm probably going to go poke around that at some point.
4965622	4993566	and last but not least they're also adding a new thing to Steam Greenlight which is called Concepts basically allows you to post your game without the $100 fee to gauge kind of interest in what people would want to you know if people would be even interested in your game and so if you get a lot of interest then you may pony up the $100 to you know have it actually greenlit and put on the Steam store so that's kind of neat sounds like that project's doing very well for them yeah sounds pretty cool
4994728	4995308	Awesome, awesome.
4996308	4999949	All right, one more story for you guys, then we'll get into the classic game of the week.
5000489	5002790	This is another legal story.
5003430	5005671	This is kind of, wow.
5006431	5015313	Dave Rushton, who was the founder and president of Sensory Sweep Studios, they were in Utah, he got sentenced to 12 months in the slammer.
5016033	5021516	Find $1.2 million in unpaid wages to more than 100 employees.
5022097	5025439	This goes all the way back to a lawsuit from 2009 by the U.S.
5025479	5026339	Department of Labor.
5027120	5031883	Apparently, employees claimed they were not paid in over 100 days for their work.
5032423	5036506	The employees also alleged their 401k money had been stolen by the company.
5037586	5052851	Dave Rushton has already served jail time for other charges relating to the company he pled guilty to one third degree felony charge of failing to file taxes and one second degree felony charge of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity this is all according to the Salt Lake Tribune
5053331	5054432	How not to run your business
5080336	5081557	You gotta pay your... That's right.
5081577	5090422	You gotta, you know, if you're gonna, you know, hire people, you do have to send them a paycheck at some point or they might get angry because they're kind of waiting on you to pay them to say they can like pay their mortgage.
5090482	5092403	You know, it's kind of things they want to do.
5094028	5096569	And you probably want to pay your taxes as well.
5097110	5100171	Especially when you are the head of a company like that.
5100291	5103053	But you can just write it off for your horse.
5103113	5110517	Or if you're a singer, like Lauryn Hill, or who else got busted for tax evasion?
5110537	5111057	They get caught.
5111257	5112398	The guy who won Survivor?
5112958	5114219	They all end up getting caught.
5115819	5116600	Wesley Snipes?
5116900	5117400	Yeah, that's right.
5117420	5118521	That was a big one too.
5118861	5121502	But remember, that's how they got Capone.
5123023	5123643	That's right.
5123763	5124204	That's right.
5124224	5124984	That's how they got Capone.
5126004	5126304	All right.
5126985	5128685	Let's travel to a classic time.
5128725	5143210	Maybe not as classic as DarkSakura is referring to, but let's go back a few years into gaming's history and a classic video game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, brats, play this game or else I'll kill you.
5143230	5144350	If you can find it, good luck.
5144390	5145611	If you can find it.
5145651	5148592	Honestly, I can say tonight's game, I had never fucking heard of this game.
5149512	5150492	I had never heard of this game.
5150532	5152033	You've got the Namco collection, right?
5152665	5154166	Valkyrie no Bokken, Toki no Kagi Densetsu
5171991	5177233	The game title translates to The Adventure of Valkyrie, The Legend of the Time Key.
5178393	5182054	And it came out on... This is the Famicom version.
5182294	5182494	Right.
5182974	5186715	Which is sort of overhead-y, Zelda-ish, scroll-y.
5187435	5189796	It actually, with the way the enemies appear, makes me think of Zelda 2.
5191777	5192657	But I love the music.
5192877	5195178	Can I just say the other English name people would know this by?
5195438	5196318	Legend of the Valkyrie.
5196418	5197499	Nope, that's actually the sequel.
5197839	5198559	Oh, my bad, okay.
5198579	5200240	Which is why I said two games.
5200460	5200880	Oh, okay.
5201240	5201480	Oops.
5201500	5203101	Yeah.
5203961	5206722	So basically for the original one, you're in Marvel Land.
5207563	5214513	and basically you have to get the Key of Time back from whoever stole it.
5214593	5222925	It actually really has a lot in common with Dragon Warrior and the real-time combat system of The Legend of Zelda.
5223966	5229751	Now, this was, it has absolutely no text in the game.
5231132	5239899	There is a patch that changes the title screen if you've got the, like if you're playing it on an emulator.
5240759	5247165	And look for the one that was done by DVD Translations, that one is the best.
5247905	5258234	Now, there is a sequel, and this is the one that people have probably heard of, is Valkyrie No Densetsu, which is The Legend of the Valkyrie.
5258734	5263818	And this came out in 1989 as an arcade game, and then it came out on the PC Engine in Japan.
5264379	5265800	And it is the sequel to the 1986 Famicom game.
5268702	5270704	This one also came out in the U.S.
5270744	5272686	as part of Namco Museum Vol.
5272706	5279392	5, the O. And the PC Engine version came out on the Virtual Console in Japan.
5279952	5282675	And this one is basically a two-player game.
5282755	5286819	The player one has Valkyrie, and the second one has Krino Sandra.
5287539	5309569	which was romanized actually as Zandra with an X-A-N-D-R-A and was named um Whirlo in the English version of uh the prequel which was uh Zandra no Daibouken Valkyrie no Valkyrie Tono Dei I think is how it's pronounced um who's a green lizard and basically it's you know a lot of
5311736	5318921	Over the World, scrolling, shooting, punching enemies in the face with your sword, going into little huts and buying stuff.
5319081	5320942	It's such an adorable game.
5324190	5331554	If people don't have the O from the Namco collection, which as I understand the O is a little hard to find, get this game.
5331614	5345842	It was a really, really fun little game and it is fully translated and available in the US if you can find the Namco O. It actually though has a different ending from the arcade version.
5346442	5348884	With the home version you do have a level save.
5349705	5354091	I actually have, Rob, I've got the Famicom version of the first game.
5355213	5357457	And I have the HuCard of this too.
5358198	5360261	So I was very happy to pick those up.
5360874	5365196	And I mean, it's just really, it's a straightforward little, you know, adventure game.
5366597	5370839	It's very Zelda slash Dragon Quest-y.
5371079	5375301	I don't know why, maybe it's the cartoony style or something, but I'm suddenly reminded of Willow.
5376002	5376282	Yeah.
5376482	5377482	God, I love that game.
5377502	5380164	I was just thinking about like, I want to play Willow again.
5380184	5384026	It's like all the little monsters and the little Valkyrie are all chibi and adorable.
5384086	5384326	Yeah.
5385266	5389728	And, I mean, but you can get super powered up.
5390149	5395451	Now, you see how on this video here we're watching how she's jumping from platform to platform?
5395851	5400594	That used to always screw me up because I would think that it was over the regular ground and I'd walk off of them.
5402194	5405656	I mean, I know better, but the first time I tried to play it, it was actually pretty difficult.
5405984	5407304	I want to check this video out over here.
5407324	5412246	I'm hoping some dude isn't talking over this, but this is the main version, so I'm assuming this is just a direct arcade version.
5412266	5415027	I'm going to hope it's without any dudes talking over it.
5416147	5417028	Let me see what happens here.
5417248	5417508	Yeah.
5418608	5419028	Okay, good.
5420209	5421069	Oh, this looks okay.
5421449	5422430	It's pretty much the same thing.
5422950	5427531	Yeah, it definitely has that arcade-style interface, though, but okay.
5428352	5431413	But, I mean, the PC Engine version is damn good.
5431873	5432093	Yeah.
5432113	5432193	Yeah.
5434771	5435811	I've checked this out at some point.
5436132	5448215	Now, I'll tell you where I first heard about this game is I had a gachapon capsule that was a little Namco figurine set.
5448415	5450696	Dan and I tried to collect all of them and one of them was a Valkyrie.
5451116	5452617	And I was like, oh, this is pretty cool.
5452837	5456418	And then it turned out that, hey, there's this whole game and you should play it.
5456478	5459179	And, oh, yeah, we actually have that because we have it on the Namco O. Yeah.
5460416	5462378	Zandra no Daibouken, Valkyrie to no Daibouken
5477571	5503408	Valkyrie Tonodai I think I'm pronouncing that right and pulling this one up that translates to Zandra's Great Adventure a counter with the Valkyrie and that's the little green lizard man meeting up with the Valkyrie chick and that one though is a side scrolling game it's a lot different I usually I'd say that for any of them my favorite of the three is the Valkyrie No Densets so totally awesome game
5504948	5529879	and that's the classic game and I'm sticking to it alright there it is your classic game of the week a couple of games there but we'll say Valkyrie no Densetsu as that seems to be the one that if you're going to go find this game that's probably going to be the one you're going to find if you want to play it in English it's on the Namco Classics which was the Playstation version and it's the letter O
5530506	5530926	There you go.
5531706	5533347	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5533407	5535087	That is a nice, obscure pick.
5535308	5535808	I like that.
5536748	5538949	All right, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5538969	5545131	There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come for tonight, including your emails, or is it lack thereof once again?
5546011	5553893	Also, we're going to have some news on some things going on with Kickstarter, more lawsuit news, and you are not going to believe what happened with this PC release.
5554013	5559095	The Google Question of the Week and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5565370	5567852	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5567892	5574896	We are live on this October the 21st of 2012 with the 478th episode of our show.
5575757	5579679	During the music break there, we can't play these on the podcast because, you know, copyright reasons and all that.
5579719	5582181	But I will say we played a song there from Second Detsetsu 3.
5583082	5587224	It was giving the chatters a hard time trying to figure out what game that was from.
5587264	5589526	Did anybody ever play that when it had the translated cartridge?
5589546	5590166	Yeah, I played that, too.
5590186	5591167	I played through about half of it.
5591227	5591607	Yeah, yeah.
5592888	5598312	I still say though to this day, Secret of Evermore was sadly hazed and underrated by the folks here.
5598352	5599973	I thought Secret of Evermore wasn't a bad game.
5600013	5608898	Although I do understand it was a different, you know, it was the one square USA title that, you know, for whatever reason, people didn't seem to like it as much.
5609018	5610019	But anyhow.
5611780	5617844	Loki, before we get into rapid fire news, you were playing during the break there this interesting music shooter game you were mentioning before.
5618024	5620526	Yeah, I had mentioned it on the show before because it was something I kickstarted.
5620566	5621908	It was called Rhythm Destruction.
5622188	5628514	And since they got funded and they're kickstarting it, basically, I think it was like five bucks and you get the game.
5628554	5635320	And the game, it's interesting because the way it plays, it's a shooter, like a top-down shooter, space shooter, I guess.
5635800	5635980	But...
5636761	5639903	All the shooting is done as a rhythm game.
5640103	5645507	So the enemies come up on the screen and you see a circle come around them and you have to hit them with the beat of the music.
5645627	5649690	And it uses an Xbox 360 controller so they're mapped to the face buttons.
5650030	5656134	And then all the dodging of bullets and stuff is done with the analog sticks and your triggers are kind of like a boost type thing.
5656514	5660377	So you're dodging stuff and having to do the rhythm game part, which is kind of really cool.
5660917	5662879	And it's got music from Kyle Wardner.
5662899	5665720	I was playing one that was a Kaa song.
5667361	5669782	He shows up in the strangest places music game wise, doesn't he?
5670102	5670603	Good for him.
5670803	5671223	Good for him.
5671563	5672844	But it's a pretty awesome game.
5673004	5673784	Gotta pay the bills.
5674885	5675365	Exactly.
5675445	5679306	So I'm not really sure where... I think you can buy it off their website.
5680287	5687150	I'm trying to remember where it is because, you know, obviously... I don't think they... I think they're trying to get...
5689315	5690556	onto the Steam store.
5690656	5691376	I don't know if they've done it.
5691637	5692237	Oh, yeah, here we go.
5692697	5694398	RhythmDestruction.com.
5694518	5695359	You can check it out.
5695459	5697500	It's by a company called Curious Pandas.
5697620	5699301	The group did it.
5699482	5701923	And I think you can... Pandas, you say?
5702784	5703424	Yes, Pandas.
5703604	5707287	I think you can buy the game on maybe...
5709855	5710455	Let's see here.
5710515	5712136	Yeah, there's a buy it now on the website.
5712156	5717337	I'm trying to see $4.99 is all they're asking for when you pay for it with PayPal.
5717357	5718997	Well, good luck.
5719118	5719758	It's pretty awesome.
5719918	5720658	I like music games.
5720678	5721258	I like shooters.
5721798	5722258	It's worth it.
5722298	5723799	I mean, it's a pretty awesome game.
5724779	5725179	Check it out.
5725659	5725919	All right.
5727980	5735222	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BRAIN.
5736087	5741224	Let's get into some rapid fire news before we get to the Fugo question of the week, which tonight is all about Zynga.
5741304	5741987	It'll be fun.
5742729	5742970	Loki.
5743618	5745499	Far Cry 3 Locations and Character Skins
5769454	5769874	Far Cry 3 Far Cry 3
5796167	5797649	Dirt Rob, Dirt and Water Sundermen
5816807	5817688	Oh, that's scary.
5817708	5819550	That would be awesome.
5819890	5820510	Borderlands 2.
5820610	5821111	Slenderman.
5822552	5822953	Enderman.
5824474	5827677	Black Ops 2 on the Wii U is not going to have Call of Duty Elite.
5827977	5832341	Because all the other systems are going to be getting Call of Duty Elite at launch.
5832361	5834182	Because they're kind of doing it as a free thing.
5834663	5839967	And instead of having to pay $60 for all the perks of Elite, you can get everything for free.
5839987	5842189	And then you just pay $60 for a map pack instead.
5842769	5843010	Or the...
5843610	5845552	and subscription for the map packs.
5845572	5847974	That's really why they got Elite in the first place.
5849575	5851437	However, the Wii U is not getting the support.
5851497	5856441	It says, we're currently evaluating options for Call of Duty Elite to support Nintendo's Wii U game system.
5856501	5862726	However, Call of Duty Elite for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 will not support this platform when the game launches November 13th.
5863107	5866610	Which makes me wonder, what is borked about their fucking online?
5866870	5867931	Because that's kind of...
5870489	5873292	Call of Duty Late is kind of like this app thing.
5873572	5880239	Maybe they're not going to allow these third-party apps for the Wii U dashboard or whatever.
5880539	5883302	Well, you know what didn't make the show roll tonight that's worth talking about?
5883682	5886005	Did you hear about the updates with Nintendo Voice Chat?
5887378	5907923	and how they're not selling a headset they're going to be third party headsets and if you use the Nintendo Pro Controller there is no space for a headset so you have to have your Wii Pad with the headset and the Wii Pad and then your Pro Controller not looking good for Nintendo convincing me they understand online finally not looking good
5909696	5912797	I'm surprised we didn't put that story in here because I could have gone on a whole tangent about that.
5912837	5915658	But yeah, not thrilled by that news.
5916499	5917259	Not at all.
5917299	5923501	It would be not so bad if that system supports Bluetooth and they have Bluetooth headsets and stereo stuff as well.
5924922	5928723	Or that they're not doing a first-party headset because they're going to support any headset.
5928783	5934825	Apparently on the gamepad they do have a spot for headphones but not necessarily a headset type thing.
5935426	5936386	And apparently...
5937928	5943476	You can enable it, but at default it's disabled to use the microphone that's actually on the gamepad for...
5946212	5946552	Chat.
5947693	5948053	I don't know.
5949535	5957381	The fact we haven't heard much about it other than, hey, check out this, like, I don't even know what the fuck they're calling it, the Mii Plaza or whatever the fuck their community thing is.
5957661	5958382	Hey, check this out.
5958642	5959102	Hey, guess what?
5959142	5961184	You can leave messages for friends and games.
5961684	5962025	Okay.
5962465	5963406	Well, what about accounts?
5963446	5965147	What about, like, achievements and stuff like that?
5965487	5967048	Hey, check out this, like, Mii Plaza thing.
5967249	5968710	Hey, you can leave messages for friends and games.
5969010	5970011	I think that's all it's going to be.
5970211	5970711	I think that's it.
5970912	5972293	I think that and a shop and that's it.
5972853	5974855	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5996192	5997253	I don't know, it doesn't make any sense.
5997673	6000136	But yeah, here's something else that's not coming to the Wii U version.
6001177	6003919	I mean, really, the Wii U version is going to be kind of similar to the rest of them.
6003999	6007622	I just think, I don't know, I think something's borked with their online.
6007662	6014028	That's how it is, because this should be something that should be easily implemented, but it's not for whatever reason.
6015649	6017450	And then last but not least, Obsidian.
6017930	6024592	They've concluded their Project Eternity Kickstarter at $3.9 million raised.
6025472	6031374	And I guess that's even more than Double Fine Adventures got.
6031394	6033154	Because remember, Double Fine Adventures had $3.3 million.
6033194	6034035	That's right.
6034055	6035475	Wow, good for them.
6035595	6036756	They beat that.
6036856	6037756	And of course, you know...
6040018	6043060	I guess Planetary Annihilation was another one similar to that.
6044622	6046323	Multi-million dollar raise.
6046944	6050627	They got 2.2 million and the OUYA had 8.5 million.
6051087	6056813	I almost backed this but I saw that the game wasn't coming out until 2014 so I'll wait.
6057133	6058954	It's just not something I want to back.
6060035	6061637	You need your games to be designed faster.
6062651	6080622	well it's just that's kind of a long ways and and I'm assuming that you know they're not necessarily going to hit their you know date for that stuff because like for example the Kickstarter I did for my very first Kickstarter which was for VGHS video game high school they still haven't delivered the DVDs on that stuff yet
6080802	6081343	Thanks for watching!
6101610	6101930	All right.
6102591	6104432	Well, how about free games?
6104512	6107634	We like free, and this is a very interesting sort of free game.
6108694	6113517	This is being developed by NeoGAF members, you know, the big popular gaming forum, right?
6113877	6120041	I guess they formed a studio called Grimoire Assembly Forge, and they're creating this parody on modern shooters.
6120501	6121762	It's called Dude Bro 2.
6122923	6127446	The actual title is, Dude Bro, my shit is fucked up, so I gotta shoot slice you too.
6127486	6128766	It's straight up dog time.
6129987	6130368	All right.
6130608	6134211	It's based off of a meme that someone was, like, complaining about something.
6134231	6137274	They're like, well, why don't you just go play Dude Bro 2?
6138435	6142578	So someone started, like, making character art and started doing, like, box art.
6142598	6145221	It's like bungee ferret tossing.
6145341	6147022	Somebody took the joke way too far.
6147082	6147883	I gotcha, I gotcha.
6148944	6151546	Apparently, though, you want to talk about the joke going way too far.
6151647	6152247	John St.
6152307	6152647	John.
6153368	6153988	You know John St.
6154008	6154188	John?
6154248	6155849	He is Duke Nukem.
6155869	6156609	He's the voice of Duke Nukem.
6156669	6157969	He will be John Dude Bro.
6158009	6159150	You need to play the song.
6159830	6160490	I think it's in the trailer.
6160510	6161991	Is this the little trailer song?
6162011	6162771	I think it's in the trailer.
6162791	6164291	Let me play a little clip of it here.
6166192	6168012	It's straight up dog time.
6171513	6172934	It's got a rap even.
6182151	6185155	It looks pretty awesome.
6185315	6186356	It looks very old school.
6186677	6188779	At least in these cutscenes.
6193437	6200158	It looks like Commander Keen or something.
6200258	6207180	That's actually kind of rad.
6207400	6209080	That's where Duke Nukem got its start, really.
6209740	6210380	That's kind of cool.
6211501	6212341	Hey, I like free.
6213901	6218202	PlayStation All-Stars apparently have been hacked into Super Smash Bros.
6218302	6218742	Brawl.
6219702	6222245	I don't know how this happened, but yeah, this is some modders.
6222966	6237324	They developed the Smash Brothers, but they actually have some of the PlayStation All-Stars, but they put some other people into this as well, like Nico Bellic from Grand Theft Auto 4, John Marston from Red Dead Redemption, Laura Croft from Tomb Raider, Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid.
6237364	6238225	I mean, it's a hack.
6239426	6241547	So they don't have to worry about licensing or anything.
6241587	6243027	They just put whoever the fuck they want in there.
6243947	6250209	Kazuya from Tekken, Tomba, Isaac Clark from Dead Space, get this, Commander Shepard from Mass Effect.
6250690	6251530	But it's Man Shep.
6252190	6252870	So it doesn't count.
6255591	6260455	It's a free mod, but again, you will have to mod and do all that stuff.
6260475	6266379	But I think those mods, I'm not sure with the whole character skins and models and stuff like that.
6266640	6269082	I think a lot of them you can do with just an SD card.
6269102	6270723	You don't even need to mod your system.
6270743	6273385	I think it's just going through a hacked save type thing.
6273425	6275026	So that might be one of those.
6275306	6275747	I don't know.
6275787	6277048	I haven't really researched it too much.
6277808	6280170	All right, and one other story about Nintendo Land.
6280710	6283832	The final little mini games inside Nintendo Land have been announced.
6284293	6292939	Captain Falcon's Twister Race, where you hold the narrow end of the Wii U gamepad upright to guide a high-speed wind-up vehicle towards the finish line.
6293699	6294620	Octopus Dance.
6297085	6298206	I couldn't say it without laughing.
6298786	6300847	It's a single-player rhythm-based game.
6300867	6301908	You use the gamepad.
6301948	6308471	You memorize the movement of the character on the screen and reenact the poses using the control sticks or the gyro sensor.
6309272	6311173	And lastly, Yoshi's Fruit Cart.
6312914	6315195	What, are you a fan of Yoshi's Fruit Cart, DarkSakura?
6315535	6316315	It just made me snort.
6316475	6319877	You guide Yoshi's Cart towards the goal while collecting fruit on the way.
6320017	6321418	Oh, well, that's not just a clever name.
6321898	6324760	You can see fruit on the TV but not the gamepad.
6327706	6329627	Sounds like innovation to me.
6330248	6330668	There you go.
6330708	6331228	So, hey.
6331709	6340634	So, now you being a big fan of F-Zero, do you think that homage is worthy of, like, you know, they're going to get the fans excited about F-Zero with this wonderful game?
6340654	6342315	I think they can stop being fucking cocktease.
6342355	6343176	This is what they can do.
6344056	6347538	I hope to hell that... That's a page out of Capcom's book right there.
6347578	6351681	That better be the secret project that Retro or whatever is working on is the new F-Zero.
6351701	6352181	It's like, hey, hey, hey.
6352581	6356044	F-Zero wind-up shit that you don't care about.
6356264	6358926	At this point, I give no fucks about anything else.
6359466	6361268	It better not be Pilotwings or some shit.
6361348	6362809	It better be fucking F-Zero.
6363710	6365691	We already remade Pilotwings.
6365771	6366212	Exactly.
6366252	6369154	And Pilotwings, the remake of Pilotwings is fucking terrible.
6369454	6370955	Three goddamn things.
6370975	6371776	I won't go that far.
6373157	6398733	3 fucking events way to go Nintendo way to not like even put any effort in that's Nintendo doing the least bit of work so we can sell some shit that people will buy anyways because we're fucking Nintendo there just needs to be a Captain Falcon game where all he does is punch people now that would have been a classic minigame that would have been great Falcon punch show me your move
6400447	6406074	So, Pikmin 3 is going to be on the Wii U and no one is excited.
6407155	6410599	Actually, that came from Iwata making that little announcement.
6412461	6415164	Next up, do you want to learn about video games at school, Rob?
6416394	6417614	No, school sucks.
6417834	6418155	Bite me.
6418735	6419235	I like school.
6420055	6428457	There's a class that is at Rice University in Houston, Texas called Scandinavian Fantasy Worlds, Old Norse Sagas, and Skyrim.
6429598	6445622	And basically it's, and I'm reading the quote here, introduces students to fantasy as both psychological concept and the driving force in gamer culture by having students read selections from Old Norse and Old Icelandic sagas in translation and as they play different quests in Skyrim.
6447156	6457002	and it's pretty awesome because there's a part of the midterm where you get to give your best last but not least Just Dance 4
6458595	6458715	Uh-oh.
6482136	6487039	So yeah, I have actually just introduced a friend of mine to the video last night, so it was pretty funny.
6487079	6487959	You know what you did, right?
6488239	6488639	Yeah, I know.
6488659	6489140	You went there.
6495783	6496403	I have the album.
6498484	6500846	All I have to say, look, I... The album's good.
6501346	6503007	I'm kind of already over this, but...
6504167	6512132	It was really weird to turn on the radio on a top 40 station nonetheless and hear this song played.
6512272	6513713	Not as an act of parody.
6514173	6516034	Not as a, lol, listen to this.
6516414	6518095	Not as, hey, this is what the kids on the internet are.
6518135	6518315	No.
6518776	6521237	You hear, up next, Psy with Gangnam Style.
6521297	6523078	I thought it was PSY.
6523838	6525179	I think most people were saying Psy.
6525259	6531243	Because in one of the songs, it does this little thing where they say the name of the person and it's PSY.
6532343	6532884	Well, whatever.
6532904	6533204	Whatever.
6534696	6543370	but actually it's a good album and I really like I think the song's called Passionate Goodbye it's a really good song so I like the album
6544096	6544396	JustMyStyle
6568232	6572594	Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, just wait until he releases his US album.
6572634	6573274	That is happening.
6573314	6575035	He did get signed to a US label.
6575976	6578457	Buying it.
6578737	6579857	Justin Bieber's label, too.
6581718	6584799	That guy, though, not Justin Bieber, but Psy, you have to admit, he's super adorable.
6585019	6586900	Have you seen him in interviews and stuff?
6587120	6588841	You just want to pinch his cheeks.
6588881	6589481	He's so cute.
6590462	6591622	And I mean that in a totally...
6594369	6617414	Bro Way like he's just he's really just I don't know there's something about him he's got a great personality the album seriously I think it's like seven bucks on iTunes and it was totally a worthwhile purchase for me not just trying to sell it but it was pretty pretty good I love driving to it I'll put it that way I drive very fast no I like the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack if I want to drive fast
6619315	6620596	I wish they'd do another one of those games.
6621116	6621337	Anyway.
6622798	6623098	Let's see.
6623138	6623598	Where are we at?
6623638	6624159	What time is it?
6624259	6626020	Oh, it's Fugle Question of the Week time.
6626100	6626761	Hooray!
6635199	6639002	Facebook, smash it with Google+, and together you get Foogle.
6639062	6641304	And that's where our segment comes from.
6641625	6645148	We ask a question in our fan communities every week, and we read some of our favorite answers.
6645808	6647210	The question was short and sweet tonight.
6647350	6650493	Obviously, we've been talking a little bit about Zynga and some of the things that have been going on over there.
6651513	6655014	The question this week is, in 10 years, how do you think people will remember Zynga?
6655315	6657035	What will their mark on history look like?
6657355	6659636	I want to know, and I'm looking for some serious answers here.
6659696	6662717	I know some of you want to take the cheap, easy way out and say, LOL, poop.
6663177	6664638	But, you know, I'm really curious.
6664698	6665698	What are they going to be remembered by?
6666598	6666979	Let's see.
6667239	6667779	Going to Google+.
6669167	6678034	Redertainment says, I believe the answer to this question will depend on how many of the people who currently actively play Zynga games will in 10 years time succumb to dementia.
6678754	6680355	Okay, it's like 10 years.
6680756	6681036	10, not 45.
6681897	6682217	It's 10.
6684078	6684498	Let's see.
6686640	6689222	Legend668 on Google Plus says, Zing who?
6689762	6691344	Already fading from my mind.
6692424	6694186	Monster B says, what was Zynga?
6695326	6698509	And Sean F says, no, people may not remember Facebook.
6700171	6701633	That's actually a good point, though.
6702514	6704856	How much longer is the Facebook fad going to last?
6705997	6708700	Their stock sure doesn't seem to indicate it'll last much longer.
6709141	6709501	I don't know.
6710122	6711363	But people can't stop using it.
6711944	6717690	Anyway, if you want to see more answers from Google+, head to our community, Orange Lounge Radio on Google+.
6717730	6719271	Those are some of the answers tonight.
6719732	6720853	Going to Facebook.
6723160	6731243	and some of the answers we got on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio for our frugal question of the week about Zynga.
6732734	6734114	Sorry, I'm waiting for it to load.
6734334	6734915	All right, there we go.
6735175	6737255	Oh, yes, I remember this story from Bobby Blackwolf.
6737715	6743296	I know I'll forever remember them as the only company I ever said no to when their recruiter contacted me.
6743917	6744697	It's probably for the best.
6745717	6754599	Codeman says, a company that made a very addictive crack kind of addicting games and secretly taking our money like a reverse tooth fairy.
6755539	6756740	Dude, you've given them money?
6756820	6757360	Secretly?
6759813	6761335	You just admitted something on the show.
6761375	6762456	I'm just kidding.
6762616	6763397	Lauren T says,
6769927	6773328	and almost completely alienating its loyal players.
6774509	6778690	That's a very good answer from Lauren, a company that alienated its loyal players.
6779330	6782491	How not to do... Why are you showing me animated GIFs while I'm trying to do this segment?
6782531	6783632	Because this is in the chat room.
6784292	6792054	What is... It's a football player doing the... Oh, is he... I didn't even catch that at first.
6792074	6793255	Alright, can I read the answers from Facebook?
6793275	6793855	Yeah, I guess.
6795311	6800853	RedTheHay says, it'll be remembered as that company that made those games like those other games but wasn't Gameloft.
6803034	6811978	AZHP says, I'm guessing if people still talk about them in 10 years, they'll talk about Zynga the same way the people who talk about Neopets do now.
6812598	6814919	Remember when Neopets was a thing, DarkSakura?
6815599	6816160	Lord, I do.
6816240	6816720	I played it.
6817025	6829457	Well, we were talking about how technology is advancing so fast and stuff that in 10 years, who knows if that type of gaming will be even popular because they'll have stuff that's comparable to what we're playing on consoles right now on the mobile devices.
6830278	6832801	Acidic Vampire says, is that a legendary Pokemon?
6835500	6841122	TigerClaw says in 10 years they will be known as the one company to single-handedly destroy the concept of social gaming.
6841182	6843723	That's pretty powerful stuff there, but perhaps.
6845284	6850345	Burr responded saying, we'll remember Zynga the same way we remember MySpace compared to 10 years ago.
6850665	6857448	Although honestly, to be in a retentive here for a minute, was MySpace really a thing 10 years ago or was that when Friendster was the big deal?
6858048	6859488	10 years is a long time in tech terms.
6859508	6860829	You know, I never used Friendster.
6861029	6861329	Did you?
6861469	6861769	Really?
6862089	6862950	Yeah, I never used it.
6863230	6863870	Never used it?
6864918	6865158	Never.
6865839	6866199	Let's see.
6867020	6875787	Matt J said, they will forever be remembered by me as that company with those horrible apps I had to block which was responsible for the downturn of Facebook.
6877219	6877620	Let's see.
6878921	6880082	Other answers here.
6880843	6882845	Steven M says, Farmville, that's it.
6883606	6886029	Hitstun says, Zynga taught us an all-important lesson.
6886069	6889753	If you want your game to make the big bucks, it doesn't have to be original or good.
6890113	6891595	It just has to be annoying.
6891916	6892536	And Endwithville.
6893397	6893998	And Endwithville.
6894418	6896881	I'm going to read this long answer here from Matt J because it's pretty good.
6897842	6900564	Truthfully, in my opinion, they'll certainly be remembered.
6900805	6903147	I feel that they'll be remembered for a couple of things.
6903207	6905649	Well, really just for Farmville and the legacy it created.
6906089	6909913	It helped to create a market for Facebook games, really for social network games in general.
6910313	6915257	I mean, I do believe there were some before Farmville, but they never really got the light of day they have now until Farmville.
6915818	6921443	Zynga will be remembered in the end for creating the Farmville phenomenon and helping to create a new gaming platform.
6924145	6926586	Farmville is the game that got so many into Facebook gaming.
6926926	6932607	Surely there will be some footnotes in the history books for Zynga seemingly stealing ideas from others and the lawsuits involved.
6932968	6937349	Sure, some will remember the foaming hatred some in the gaming community had and have for Zynga.
6937669	6941490	However, most will simply remember one little word, Farmville.
6941810	6948312	That will be the biggest thing Zynga will be remembered for, Farmville and helping launch the Facebook social network gaming phenomenon.
6948832	6956739	Pretty good answer there that, you know, hate them all you want now, but when you look back on history, it's really going to be about Farmville and the social stuff.
6957119	6958120	Good answers from everybody.
6958200	6961203	I'm sorry I didn't have time to read them all, but a whole lot of you responded tonight.
6961523	6966347	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to read all of the answers, which were very good.
6966467	6973233	I'll remember the day that someone drew a tank through their business and spelled out Sega in bullets.
6974334	6974654	What?
6974974	6975354	I'm kidding.
6976355	6977416	Oh, I'm sorry, that hasn't happened yet.
6977436	6979276	Don't say that kind of stuff on this show.
6979356	6980777	I don't want the po-po coming over.
6980817	6981717	No, I wouldn't do it.
6981797	6990761	I think you can remember them by the fact that they probably popularized freemium gaming and made it a little bit more popular as far as a business model that everybody's going to start using.
6992754	6995996	I'll remember the day that I blocked FarmVille.
6996676	7002039	And I'll remember every other day that Facebook has unblocked FarmVille.
7002139	7004700	I'm a little ashamed to say that I did play FarmVille.
7004760	7005401	I will tell you this.
7005441	7006761	I played it to impress a guy.
7007482	7008462	I never played FarmVille.
7008983	7009723	Never touched it.
7009883	7012585	And when I blocked it, I never got another thing for it.
7012885	7016507	However, my mother would keep saying, Why are my cows dying?
7016567	7017307	Or something like that.
7017867	7019888	I'd be like, You don't have cows, Mom.
7019908	7020409	You've never... Oh...
7022489	7028775	Cow's Dying Now, Digimon, Dying... Hey, I love Digimon.
7030657	7032378	I like Digimon better than Pokemon, I'll put it that way.
7032398	7032659	Tamagotchis.
7032799	7033119	Tamagotchis.
7033139	7034300	That's what you're trying to think of, yeah.
7035321	7037363	All right, let's do some more long news, Loki.
7038112	7038853	Neopets.
7039593	7040514	Anyways.
7041035	7042096	So, Ubisoft.
7042416	7042897	Wait, hold on.
7042937	7044658	I gotta correct something BlackWolf said in chat.
7045079	7046900	BlackWolf said, Alan likes FarmVille.
7046920	7047441	Confirm.
7047581	7049323	No, this was pre-Alan.
7049623	7052586	This was another guy several years ago when FarmVille first came out.
7053026	7054007	And he was really into it.
7054027	7055428	And I was like, alright, I'll try this.
7055529	7060874	And then it's like, oh, I have to keep checking on these blueberries and shit every three hours or whatever.
7060914	7060994	And
7061334	7084058	which is why I refuse to do the farming in WoW I can talk about this now because he's a thing of the past but he really liked the Farmville song which is so stupid because it's like the same five notes over and over again in different keys I remember joking about having a 70 minute soundtrack to Farmville and it was just those same five notes over and over Lord
7090221	7091782	Why are you staring at me like that, Loki?
7092082	7093223	Because I've never heard of that song.
7093623	7094964	You've never heard the Farmville song?
7095044	7095324	No.
7095464	7098647	Neither have I. I would like to not hear that song.
7101669	7102190	I'm sorry.
7102310	7108995	You can't go all this time and then be all like, oh, I have never heard the song and then not expect somebody to not play the song.
7109095	7111056	I'm totally expecting an awesome song.
7112497	7113038	Oh, this is like...
7116483	7117644	Wait, that's like all different now.
7117684	7118945	When did they modernize it?
7119385	7121947	It used to be just these little tones that would play over and over again.
7123168	7124849	Oh, forget it.
7125570	7126911	Yay!
7126971	7129333	That was fantastically non-generic at all.
7131534	7133696	Somebody must know the old Farmville songs.
7133836	7137118	I know I'm not the only one that played Farmville back in the day.
7138059	7140601	Well, that's why I refuse to do the farming in WoW.
7141882	7142502	Not gonna do it.
7142742	7143323	It's not happening.
7144043	7144243	Alright.
7144664	7146185	I don't give a damn about your scallions.
7147168	7153371	So Ubisoft, I guess they were ones to swear off DRM in their games or something like that.
7153931	7155552	Or they patched it out for the games that had it.
7156012	7158093	Well, they apparently didn't do that all the way.
7158274	7160415	Because Rocksmith just got released this week.
7161415	7168619	And the PC version missed having the codes to activate the game inside the box.
7170199	7170520	Whoops.
7171670	7173771	Can't play the game, no activation code.
7175432	7177613	Of course, you know, people are like going, what the fuck?
7177713	7189219	You know, so they went to the Rocksmith forums and, you know, you have to go to a customer support site, fill out a form, attach a clear digital image of your receipt showing the store details and the product.
7190480	7191681	And your credit card number.
7193021	7193582	And, you know...
7195948	7209424	I don't know, it's just, it's kind of stupid though that they have this problem in the first place, that the serial wasn't part of the game manual or something like that, it wasn't printed somewhere in the game.
7209725	7214991	Oh, hey, you know, no one QA'd the fact that these games went out without codes in them.
7216772	7217392	Thanks for watching!
7232582	7239407	I don't know how many people would be pirating that game anyways, because you're talking about such a niche thing.
7239427	7252536	You're talking about a game that requires an electric guitar, that requires a special connector, so even if you did pirate the game, you'd still have to go to the store to get that USB connector to plug your guitar into your computer.
7255291	7273461	and it's just it's the PC title it's not even the console title it's that is like niche niche niche you know I mean yeah people are gonna some people probably will pirate it because they can but dude I mean come on I don't think that this is a type of game that necessarily needs that kind of DRM in there
7275003	7275363	I don't know.
7275383	7276644	It's a little ridiculous.
7277924	7282386	Yeah, especially when you make money in so many other ways with a game like this that has peripherals and everything.
7284367	7285407	Again, I think I'm with you.
7285688	7287288	It's kind of useless to pirate this game.
7287348	7289789	To play it with a keyboard is ridiculous.
7290590	7291050	You can't.
7293792	7298977	Don't ever tell a hacker they can't do something because you can remap the keyboard or whatever.
7299057	7300358	But still, it's pointless.
7300598	7301519	It's absolutely pointless.
7301960	7303201	Yeah, you have to have a guitar.
7303301	7305703	I mean, so it's just... I don't know.
7305763	7307885	It's just kind of ridiculous that they would even have that.
7308366	7308546	But...
7309841	7323249	But they did, and of course, they said, we apologize for the inconvenience caused and will provide any affected customers with the Guitarcade Time Saver, which gives players instant access to all the Rocksmith minigames.
7323730	7326732	And Ubisoft, I guess it's one of the forum mods.
7327452	7334819	So cool, you get free DLC to unlock shit in your PC game to make up for the fact that they fucked it up.
7335940	7340304	And hey, Assassin's Creed 3 is right around the corner, well, actually about a month away on PC.
7342526	7343066	More fun.
7343086	7349229	Yeah, you know, if you're one of those people, you know, word of mouth is really going to hurt them in this case, and that's really unfortunate.
7349249	7353311	Well, at least this is the title that they fucked up on in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry 3.
7353471	7356972	Still, you know, I think it's worse in this case.
7357092	7361614	I think it's worse when it's a niche title like this that really has relied on word of mouth, I think, to gain popularity.
7361634	7367257	I mean, and you should be thanking these people left and right for buying your game on PC anyways, because once again, that's...
7368097	7369438	This is such a niche game.
7369538	7373600	I don't see a lot of people on PC buying this game.
7373840	7376602	I mean, it just doesn't seem like something that they would purchase.
7376642	7384085	I mean, I guess there's going to be people that make music on their PC and stuff, but they wouldn't necessarily be wanting to learn guitar or something.
7384626	7384986	I don't know.
7385046	7385366	It's just...
7386994	7387334	It's weird.
7387454	7389076	And Ubisoft, come on.
7389136	7391858	You would think that you would figure out this whole DRM thing.
7391898	7393839	I mean, you've fucked this up before.
7393879	7395741	Driver... What was it?
7396441	7397662	Driver San Francisco.
7400024	7400945	Have you not learned?
7402126	7403326	Apparently, the answer is yes.
7403346	7403927	You have not learned.
7404227	7404948	Very unfortunate.
7406109	7414376	Well, speaking of the continued adventures of Ubisoft, Ubisoft actually filed a $1 million lawsuit yesterday against BEP Music, LLC.
7414916	7416457	Guess what BEP stands for?
7417298	7419540	The Black Eyed Peas, the band.
7419680	7420301	You know them?
7420461	7422102	Boom Boom Pow, all that stuff.
7423723	7427166	They actually wrote a song that uses the days of the week as lyrics.
7428027	7431210	Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
7432955	7434516	And that is a top 40 song.
7436257	7439299	Well, if Friday can do it, we're going to make our song seven times better.
7440680	7442381	Anyhow, the Black Eyed Peas experience.
7442401	7445423	I don't know if you know, but this was one of the dancing games that Ubisoft put out.
7446184	7447845	And it was on the various consoles.
7447965	7449166	Probably PC as well.
7449226	7451127	It was just Wii and 360?
7451227	7452268	They didn't even do it for PlayStation 3?
7452308	7453249	Or PC?
7453309	7453629	None of that?
7453669	7454509	No one gave a shit about PC.
7454530	7455050	It was all Kinect?
7455110	7455710	Alright, well, whatever.
7456111	7458532	Anyhow, it was supposed to happen on iOS.
7458812	7459133	iOS.
7459873	7485013	But apparently, BEP breached the company's contract The contract stated that the band agreed to approve or disprove the iOS version within 10 business days of request However, the music company failed to acknowledge requests for approval despite repeated attempts Ubisoft claims they spent $233,000 developing the iOS game That's how much it costs to develop a game like this, huh?
7485273	7486434	I was just curious
7487591	7488311	Thank you for watching!
7508132	7508693	Interesting.
7508753	7515363	Maybe the band felt burned by the other games and didn't want to do it, or maybe they just felt they were too good for it.
7515543	7515843	I don't know.
7515864	7516685	I don't think it was that bad.
7516865	7520450	I mean, granted, this year we have the hip-hop dance experience.
7520891	7522674	I think it is what it is, type of thing.
7523314	7523475	So...
7524878	7525178	DarkSakura.com
7554171	7555252	Oh, yeah, that.
7556952	7561494	How about some more Wii U stuff?
7562455	7573660	There's going to be a Square Enix game that's done by the developer that's porting Mass Effect 3 to the Wii U. It says it's a AAA Square Enix port, but who knows what it is?
7574480	7580483	It was actually listed on a LinkedIn page, which has since been changed.
7582538	7583619	So, who knows?
7583799	7585400	But it will be a Squeenix game.
7585640	7586080	Tomb Raider.
7586880	7587441	Eh, probably.
7587521	7593864	It's a... I don't care, because I'm not getting a Wii U. You think so, huh?
7594244	7598927	I don't think Hitman's going to be coming out, because they'd be kind of late for it if they just started development on it.
7599347	7601648	So, Tomb Raider makes sense, because it's coming out about a year from now.
7602409	7604970	They also mentioned a possibility of a Deus Ex.
7607120	7635332	once again that would be really delayed I mean Deus Ex came out last year if Arkham Asylum that's a cash in on the beginning but no one's going to want to play a game that came out three years ago that just has some different controls in it well Crystal Dynamics actually already denied Tomb Raider saying that it would have to be completely redesigned so it would be a much later released game it could still be Deadline and Riptide because I think they're publishing for that South Peak game
7635620	7637561	Alright, ready for my tinfoil hat?
7638361	7641802	What about, I know this is going to be crazy talk, what about Final Fantasy XIV?
7645203	7646944	Well, the new one could be good.
7647404	7647984	We still don't know.
7648084	7649685	Yeah, monkeys could fly out of my butt.
7649845	7650345	I guess.
7651545	7652526	Anything's possible, right?
7653066	7657787	But once again though, we're talking about a system that can't fucking handle Call of Duty Elite.
7657927	7659808	Or the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 redo.
7659908	7662929	If I start farting primates, then I'll believe it.
7664384	7664924	I don't know.
7666405	7670488	Once again, though, you were talking about a game that's probably going to be coming out next holiday.
7672089	7674430	It could be very well a title they haven't announced yet.
7674551	7680774	I mean, there's... Let's see, I'm trying to think of... I mean, they have Tomb Raider.
7680794	7682055	There's other Square Enix titles.
7682095	7683216	It could be anything.
7683476	7684817	Just use your imagination.
7684877	7685678	Chocobo Racing 2!
7686378	7686718	Yes!
7686958	7688219	Hey, that'd be awesome.
7688259	7689160	That would be awesome.
7689898	7691299	I might get a Wii U if there's Chocobo Racing.
7691319	7692019	Make it happen.
7692319	7692840	Hell yeah.
7692860	7695501	Alright, let's move on.
7698303	7698563	Alright.
7699223	7701264	Anyways.
7702385	7711390	We talk a lot about Kickstarter and there's always a conspiracy theory or not even conspiracy theory but the reality that some of these projects may not turn out well.
7712430	7721794	So that kind of happened to be the case of one of the kickstarted projects that actually did get funded is a turn-based haunted house game called Haunts.
7722674	7725715	And it was being done by a company called Mob Rules Games.
7727379	7741809	and um you know they raised um i forget what it was it was like maybe twenty thousand dollars and uh the problem is though that you know that it's been a few months or whatever um all of his programmers quit
7743932	7748637	and apparently all the money has been spent because $20,000 is not a whole lot.
7749178	7752962	But at least it seems like kind of an olive branch from the developer.
7753002	7760629	He says he's still going to continue working on the game and that if there's anybody that's seeking a refund, he will refund them out of his own pocket.
7761190	7762251	So that's kind of cool at least.
7764173	7766976	And things happen, I guess, but at least he's still moving on.
7767219	7767740	Thanks for watching!
7784034	7788037	The majority of people actually have a product that they want to put out and stuff.
7789838	7791439	Once again, you just got to do your research.
7793701	7811072	For example, that guy that wanted one million for an MMORPG and had no idea of what... Just like it was such a generic, I want to make an MMO that's going to be bigger than WoW and it's got things and races and items.
7811472	7813554	If you pledge this much, you're going to get a special item.
7813954	7837351	and I own a baseball or I used to play baseball so I know I can do this oh wait sorry no no no wrong case sorry but no you just have to do the research and they obviously kickstart stuff that you know there's a lot of developers that have pedigrees in developing games and stuff like that they're putting stuff on kickstarter you just have to you know be aware of what you're kickstarting I mean some of these companies like the one I you know like I said the rhythm destruction game
7837711	7840872	It's just like some people that, you know, some guys that are making a game.
7841492	7844733	And you don't know if that's going to be done, but they weren't asking for much money.
7845193	7847413	And sure enough, they got the game out.
7847473	7850754	So, I mean, you can't just go, oh, they're all going to fail.
7850974	7852174	But just keeping that in mind.
7852975	7858696	Remember, even if you do pledge money to Kickstarter, you always have up until that close date to change your mind.
7858896	7860316	I've done that before with stuff.
7860336	7862777	I was like, eh, I don't want to kickstart this.
7862857	7863717	And you can take your money out.
7863757	7864677	You just pledge nothing.
7865238	7866978	So, that's...
7868922	7869302	That's it.
7894500	7897242	He is now taking a position at KO University.
7897302	7898942	He is a project professor.
7899343	7904686	He will remain at Q as a spokesperson, but it sounds like this is kind of his new path here now.
7906727	7917973	KO did make an announcement about this and noted that his position in the Graduate School of Media Design will allow him to continue to produce games and further expand his expertise in the field of media design and innovative content production.
7918513	7919754	I love the stuff he's done for music games
7938732	7939993	Actdeft does make a good point.
7941193	7943994	Mizuguchi Sensei is what we have to call him from now on.
7944915	7945855	Good point, good point.
7946636	7949797	So, yeah, good luck to him in the new career.
7949857	7956800	And at least, you know, as much as we might be sad that, you know, he'll have less time for games, although they're staying, he'll still do games.
7958901	7960142	At least he'll be... He'll be grading papers.
7960382	7962163	Yeah, he'll be influencing more people.
7962403	7962783	Oh, come on.
7962803	7962983	He'll be...
7963283	7965205	Noob, noob, noob, win.
7965505	7967707	If it's anything like it is here, the TA's great.
7967727	7968267	All papers.
7968287	7968988	You and I both know that.
7969268	7969508	Alright.
7970989	7971850	Moving on.
7973371	7974092	Popcorn's good.
7974372	7975192	You should eat popcorn.
7975513	7976293	Let's get to the mailbag.
7976313	7976994	I'm eating yours.
7978395	7979736	Every week you guys send us emails.
7979776	7983759	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com We actually got some emails this week, right?
7984179	7984540	Kinda.
7985961	7990544	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some emails.
7990564	7991145	She thinks, hey!
7992335	7993115	I'm gonna read this email.
7994595	7996016	This one's long, so I'm gonna read it first.
7998336	8004358	Dear OLR, I just wanted to chime in with my thoughts on a recent game I completed, that game being Final Fantasy XIII-2.
8004858	8008778	Originally, I played the demo when it was released on the PS3, and I wasn't drawn into the game at all.
8009819	8016120	They didn't really explain anything that was going on story-wise, and it seemed to make the game out to be a Final Fantasy filler.
8020549	8023370	I also read some reviews that spun the game in a negative light.
8024030	8030712	So just saying that the music in the game was terrible and that one reviewer in particular had to turn off the sound for a final boss fight.
8031332	8035413	Boy was I surprised when I picked up the game at Best Buy Summer Sale and finally put it in my system.
8036013	8042275	The story turned out to be really interesting with time travel being an interesting mechanic as a method to traveling to different areas.
8043275	8045536	Rob, if you have it, you need to play this game to the end.
8047563	8050186	I haven't played to the end, but I've played a really good chunk of it.
8050426	8051987	And it is a good game.
8052087	8053068	I do need to beat it.
8053288	8054550	That brings me to a question for the hosts.
8055210	8061356	Have you ever played a game demo that you ended up not liking at all, only to play the full game later on and absolutely love it?
8061937	8065520	Final Fantasy VIII, except I started hating it again, but I beat it.
8068643	8071626	I thought Parappa was kind of stupid at first, and then I ended up loving it.
8074042	8074322	Nintendogs
8099457	8101060	First time I played it, I wasn't that into it.
8101100	8102062	I played it at a party.
8102082	8103164	I thought it was the best thing ever.
8104146	8107212	I don't know if that was really a demo, but that's the best answer I got.
8109292	8119317	Also, I've found that after hearing from multiple friends of how much they dislike Final Fantasy XIII, yes, the first game, then their impressions rub off on me, making me skeptical if I would even like the sequel.
8121218	8122579	If I would have liked the sequel, sorry.
8123699	8125720	Thinking back on it, however, I really love XIII.
8126501	8131143	Yes, the battle system wasn't exactly my favorite, but it was far from enough to make the game not enjoyable.
8133419	8134399	Now for a final question.
8135280	8142962	Has a popular opinion about a game that you played had an impact on how you felt about it, or do you not let what people say affect your gaming experience?
8143342	8144863	I honestly try not to let what people say.
8146163	8153786	I try not to, but if I really dislike a game and I go read that the popular opinion's very good, I do kind of go, did I miss something?
8154446	8155966	Did I not understand something?
8157127	8158247	But that doesn't happen very often.
8160327	8161467	That's all I have to say for now.
8161507	8162688	Thanks for reading, Osfer.
8163288	8163988	I'm going to cry again.
8164849	8165189	P.S.
8165289	8167389	It's really sad to hear about Jamie's dear cat, Shermie.
8168270	8170971	I'm sure she led an awesome life with her owners and will be missed.
8171031	8171991	Rest in peace, hearts.
8173291	8175312	Yeah, she led an awesomely lazy life.
8176252	8177713	That's what a lot of listeners are thinking right now.
8179639	8180519	Yeah, I miss my baby.
8181300	8181520	Okay.
8182460	8183781	This is from Tybon.
8184781	8189963	Tybon here emailed you a few years ago, and I thought I'd report back now what we're doing here in the heart of Africa.
8190644	8195246	My Xbox was red-ringed a while ago, so it's been all PlayStation here at the household.
8195666	8197407	It's very hard finding new consoles here.
8197907	8200148	All Borderlands and Skyrim marathons recently for me.
8200228	8201088	Hope you're all doing well.
8201208	8205050	Tybon, this message is brought to you by Dirt Garden, home of the never-ending empty plates.
8205250	8209514	Did we do research the first time to see if this was like a legit thing or if it was a troll?
8209534	8211997	I think we found out, yeah, this guy's like legit there.
8212037	8213078	Did he send a picture or something?
8213118	8213438	I don't know.
8213899	8214179	Yeah.
8214239	8215901	So, well, thank you for checking in, sir.
8216461	8217883	Thanks for still listening even after.
8218383	8219004	Skeptical.
8219424	8221326	And every time I read your email, I think of that song.
8221967	8223989	I remember the rains in Africa.
8224389	8224769	Toto.
8224970	8225270	Toto.
8225330	8225650	Thank you.
8225670	8226571	I was like, what's that song?
8226591	8226731	Yeah.
8229318	8231299	I've heard a really good cover of it at a concert.
8231820	8232200	Did you?
8232400	8235642	By a group, a men's acapella group called Straight No Chaser.
8238404	8239404	Is it something local?
8239784	8239964	No.
8240785	8242186	They're kind of the big thing.
8242246	8248510	They do tours and a lot of them were, I think, Broadway performers and various singers and other things.
8250051	8253473	Actually, look up the Straight No Chaser version because it's really, really good.
8254373	8254713	Let's see.
8254733	8255194	I'm trying to...
8256894	8259335	Well, I want to just make sure our listeners... Oh, God.
8261195	8261935	I'm going to shame myself.
8261955	8263296	Ads are going to be the death of me.
8264396	8265396	It's terrible radio.
8266777	8272238	You would think one of these days I'm going to learn to load this stuff in advance.
8273719	8275059	And yes, I know all the lyrics to this song.
8275819	8276159	That's it.
8276859	8277359	You were right there.
8277920	8278220	Was it?
8278540	8278780	Yeah.
8279700	8279860	Right.
8280100	8280500	Oh, there it is.
8280520	8280760	There it is.
8280820	8281080	Here we go.
8281101	8281221	That's...
8293355	8295216	Yes, I know this one by his harmony.
8301777	8302817	Is that song in Rock Band?
8303537	8304178	No, but it should be.
8304278	8304838	It should be.
8305738	8306578	Dear Harmonix.
8309239	8309819	Last email.
8310959	8311679	Greetings, OLR.
8311719	8313200	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8314540	8316620	Here's an interesting dilemma I'm in.
8317361	8318221	Oh, noes.
8318421	8318841	A dilemma.
8319884	8323847	I'm interested in a new PC game that's just come out on Steam, XCOM.
8324787	8327129	I like the demo, but I don't think it's worth 50 bucks.
8327629	8331712	So I can either get it by other means or wait for the Christmas sale or not get it at all.
8332232	8338136	My question is, if I wait for all PC games to go on sale on Steam, will publishers stop making PC games because of the lack of release sales?
8338757	8341919	Or will they notice if people like me will wait for those games to go on sale?
8343757	8349001	I want to send the publishers a message that their games are too expensive, but I still want to support the game makers.
8349782	8353444	I don't want the lack of release sales to deter them from making the games to begin with.
8353524	8356386	What do you think, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle?
8356527	8357667	Here's a reality check.
8358388	8362751	The game won't be $9.99 when the Christmas sale comes around.
8362891	8365593	The game will be like, what is it, $60 now?
8366474	8368415	It'll be like $30.
8368455	8368535	$30 or $35.
8368575	8373079	That's like best case scenario because I don't even think Skyrim went that low that fast.
8374299	8384102	So, you know, don't assume that the game... Now, I certainly am not going to encourage you to go to more nefarious means because then you certainly are sending the wrong message to the publisher.
8384202	8391864	And plus, if you do that, I don't think you'd get to do the online play and all that stuff, which I think is supposed to be... I used to love the old XCOM games.
8391984	8393684	I really need to look into this new one.
8393744	8395745	I just, you know, I've been playing all this other crap.
8395805	8395965	So...
8396533	8398335	I think they're still gonna make their money.
8398715	8398936	Yeah.
8400137	8404261	I think it's certainly better that you wait for the holiday sale than pirate it.
8404542	8406464	I mean, that's certainly the better of the two options.
8409850	8412071	Are you sending the wrong message by waiting?
8412652	8414452	I'm going to actually say not necessarily.
8414953	8422417	Because you're not the gamer that was pre-ordering this, eager about this the first day, had to have your hands on it right away.
8422477	8424338	There were other people that filled that niche for you.
8424758	8425758	You are on the fence.
8426339	8433903	And I think the company would rather have you at least tilt over and get the game eventually a little cheaper than not pay anything for it at all.
8434763	8441606	Dan Shadow in chat at live.vognetwork.com says by the way XCOM is addicting and TigerClaw says the new XCOM is awesome.
8442027	8444928	Probably not helping you being able to resist buying it right now.
8444988	8445988	I know I'm really curious.
8446308	8451911	I kind of want to see if one of my friends has it and like go over to their house and watch them play and then see if I want to get it.
8452511	8452891	We'll see.
8454112	8458934	This is 200Matt in our chat at live.vognetwork.com though warns it's hard from what I've been seeing.
8458954	8460895	There you go.
8461575	8462456	Any more emails tonight?
8463754	8464335	No!
8464756	8467843	Then let's get to the FUs of the week, because damn, y'all angry.
8484327	8502232	FU to Origin slash EA and or Bioware if Bioware is involved in this for the patch that just came out for Mass Effect 3 that's not letting me and other people connect to the game to actually play it and also not verifying my DLC so I can't play the game that I paid money for.
8502652	8502992	Sue.
8504673	8508053	Oh no, I've already put the three magic words on EA's help forum.
8508894	8509714	Better Business Bureau.
8511129	8515811	I've gotten two responses already from other people in the community, so maybe it'll greenlight it, you know?
8519272	8520653	Heavy to my cold.
8521953	8522854	I'm all stuffed up.
8525075	8527896	What do you get when you have a toddler in preschool?
8528874	8535918	Well, I don't have a toddler in preschool or whatever, but I do have a boyfriend and he's sick, so F you to the fact that he's sick.
8536838	8537859	Don't get me sick, anybody.
8537919	8542781	He can't help it, but I'm just saying, you know, I feel like Dead Man Walking right now.
8544763	8545823	I know I'm going to get sick.
8546984	8551066	I guess I'll have to try and enjoy the time off work while I'm sitting here on the couch with a fever.
8551246	8553607	Yeah, lucky for you, you can take time off of work.
8553907	8556108	If I take time off of work, I'd probably have to watch Josh.
8557088	8559149	That's not really time off of work.
8559849	8560889	Oh, here's the other perk.
8561189	8566711	Because I have a cold, I'm obviously snoring because I have to breathe through my mouth and stuff.
8567151	8567992	So I have to sleep on the couch.
8568052	8569612	I've been sleeping on the couch for the last two weeks.
8571133	8575694	And that means I'll have to tend to the baby all night long when he loses his bank and cries.
8576294	8577715	So I'm up about once every hour.
8579420	8581521	Don't worry, in a few more years, he'll be able to take care of himself.
8582061	8582301	Hopefully.
8582321	8582762	It's all good.
8582782	8584062	Well, he can take care of himself now.
8584082	8586483	He's just too tired to find his bink that's right next to his head.
8586883	8588604	And he's like, I want my bink.
8588764	8590005	It's under my head.
8590185	8592046	I'm like, why don't you get it yourself?
8592986	8597068	TigerClaw in our chatroom is reporting that the Mass Effect 3 data pad hasn't been working for weeks.
8597688	8598169	Mine's worked.
8598589	8598789	Really?
8599029	8600009	I'm at 100% right now.
8600150	8600270	Oh.
8600790	8601370	Well, then there you go.
8602331	8603371	It's just you, TigerClaw.
8603391	8603951	Uh-oh.
8604031	8605132	Uninstall, reinstall.
8606038	8633388	that's actually what I did is I uninstalled and reinstalled Mass Effect 3 and tried to play it and what happened is that it gave me the same error before so I went on offline mode and it let me go into the single player game and then I later on was able to get into multiplayer but it since hasn't allowed me to do any of it again TigerClaw in chat says I've been playing XCOM on my Twitch TV recently
8634795	8637977	That's one of those things I'm surprised I'm not into right now is streaming video games.
8638017	8638737	I think I'd have fun.
8638998	8641659	Wouldn't you guys like to see me play Mass Effect 3 online?
8642260	8642900	Wouldn't that be fun?
8643780	8647823	Yeah, Tiger Claw, saying the galaxy at war won't load.
8648223	8649144	Oh.
8650504	8659510	Yeah, it's actually, it was saying that it wasn't for me, so let me play everything, but now it's actually saying cannot log into servers or whatever.
8663330	8665554	If you can hear it, I'm actually in the thing right now.
8667797	8669139	Alright, let's move on.
8669339	8672084	A couple more news stories for you guys and then Skype line and Twitter topic.
8674412	8678154	Alright, so let's talk about Minecraft.
8678894	8682096	Minecraft's got a pretty awesome update coming out next week.
8682717	8682096	1.4!
8682937	8685518	That's a pretty scary update.
8686059	8687780	And of course it's sort of Halloween themed.
8687800	8690521	They did one a couple years ago that was also Halloween themed.
8691122	8693363	And they're adding a lot of cool shit into the game.
8693903	8696985	So first, let's talk a little bit about what they're adding.
8697645	8700247	One of the things I'm very excited about is command blocks.
8700487	8709072	And what the command blocks allow you to do is actually issue some of the commands from the admin panel in-game.
8709112	8715036	So you can have a block set up, for example, to have a certain area set to peaceful.
8715296	8718097	So no mobs spawn in a certain radius or something like that.
8718317	8719018	Or you can have...
8719498	8720559	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8739075	8741217	They're updating all the different sounds in the game.
8741537	8750664	They're adding sounds for placing different blocks, for walking on those blocks, sounds for the enemies, all sorts of cool stuff like that.
8751064	8752686	Portals are changing a little bit.
8753486	8756529	The nether portals in creative mode, you're going to be able to instantly go through them.
8757169	8761933	Adventure mode, they're allowing you to break blocks now and you can also place blocks.
8762614	8764396	They're changing how they're doing the breeding stuff.
8764416	8773629	They're adding different characters into the game, including bats, witches, and what was it?
8773729	8774250	It was the...
8778526	8781387	Wither and Wither Skeletons Creepers
8795075	8801036	And you can toggle how long it takes for them to explode and their explosion radius, which is pretty cool.
8801336	8802677	And then new blocks.
8802797	8810418	They've got, besides those command blocks, beacons, which will kind of create that Luxor pyramid beam into the sky thing.
8810478	8812018	It can give you different buffs.
8812498	8815479	Anvils to repair armor and tools.
8816499	8817739	The mob spawners, as I mentioned.
8817819	8820060	Flower pots, so you can put, you know...
8820780	8826865	Saplings, Mushrooms, Pots, Cobblestone Walls, Wooden Logs, Stairs, Item Frames, Heads, Trap Doors, Wooden Buttons,
8846623	8849525	and Potatoes, Carrots, Carrots on a Stick for riding pigs.
8849705	8851727	You can ride pigs and control where they go now.
8852448	8852748	Awesome.
8852868	8855270	So we're going to have, I'm going to set up a pig cart racing track.
8855390	8858953	That'll be pretty awesome.
8858973	8862156	Different potions including night vision and visibility potions.
8862857	8868862	Maps now you can spawn them or you can craft them so they zoom out and create larger maps.
8869062	8872125	And leather armor can be dyed so you can wear pink armor if you want to.
8873465	8881228	and of course the new villain or boss character in the game, the Wither, can be spawned too.
8881309	8896455	Although I'm kind of scared to spawn that because you can actually create it with Soul Sand and Wither Skeleton Skulls but he will attack mobs and players and he's got explosive heads that will actually blow up everything including Obsidian.
8897595	8897955	Oh boy.
8898276	8900117	So, I'll have to make a rule.
8900357	8901398	No spawning the wither.
8902579	8906282	I just sort of blanked out and had no idea what he was talking about.
8906862	8908404	It's like when you talk about Mass Effect.
8909184	8910165	You know what I'm talking about.
8910565	8911146	I at least hear you.
8911166	8912027	Well, bats are going to be cool.
8912147	8913047	I mean, those will...
8914204	8914784	Thanks for watching!
8936089	8957506	and uh yeah very cool all right well one more story for you guys tonight and this is uh a bit of a sad thing uh we did lose somebody in the gaming industry this week and it was um a UK based individual Mike Singleton unfortunately passed away this week at the age of 61 he died of natural causes and this was after a year-long battle with jaw cancer
8958606	8963828	You may not know the name, but you might know some of his contributions, including Space Ace on the Commodore VIC-20.
8964248	8966449	I don't think that's to be confused with the arcade title.
8967130	8969110	War in Middle Earth for the ZX Spectrum.
8969411	8972232	Midwinter and Midwinter 2 for the Atari ST, Amiga, and PC.
8972592	8978614	One of the most recent things he was involved with, Grid, for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
8979055	8980895	So Mike Singleton, again, passed away at 61.
8982396	8986858	Please, a tip of the glass here, a toast to Absinthe Friends.
8987938	8988238	All right.
8989398	8992559	Let's get to Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
8992739	8996800	And the Skype line is now open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8997240	8999801	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8999821	9004062	If you want to give us a call, again, the Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9004422	9006962	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9007102	9008423	I need to go grab the iPad.
9008563	9009883	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
9011444	9012765	Just some small stuff.
9013145	9020090	They were talking about having a change to the Xbox Live, I guess, service.
9020110	9027075	They're going to do Xbox Live migration to anyone, I guess, and it's going to be automated soon.
9027395	9038043	And what migration means is that if, for example, I'm in North America and I move to Europe, you can change your account so that it will, you know,
9039847	9041248	Show the European Marketplace.
9041869	9044310	Which would be completely useless if you brought your system.
9044350	9048173	But for whatever reason, if you want to change regions or something like that, then you can do that.
9048253	9050635	But they're going to allow you to do that.
9050855	9052756	Let me quickly go to the phones because we do have a call.
9052816	9053777	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9053797	9054157	Who's this?
9054718	9055438	It's Shane.
9055538	9056119	Shane.
9056139	9056739	What's up, Shane?
9057360	9059701	There are two things I would like to talk about tonight.
9059841	9060362	Number one.
9062143	9064465	Silent Hill Book of Memories is a piece of garbage.
9065406	9066526	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
9066546	9068668	You probably would have used another word, but I know you don't swear.
9069659	9074724	Well, it's also a piece of crap or a piece of... Well, I've already used two words, so it's fine.
9075085	9076026	Why is it so terrible?
9076066	9077888	You're like the biggest Silent Hill fan I know.
9078516	9080997	Not lately, because they've all been crap games.
9081257	9085398	In fact, this weekend I watched Downpour, because I haven't played it yet, and that was pretty crap too.
9087818	9093459	My boyfriend picked up the main game, and I forced him to return it, because I've heard bad things.
9093499	9100601	So then I downloaded the demo, which, you know, not always indicative of the quality of the game, but from what I understand, the demo's really close.
9101850	9107774	and it's just, it ruins everything that I like about Silent Hill.
9108415	9120283	It's a dungeon crawler with breakable weapons, mixed up characters and it's got a store for goodness sakes that you visit to buy things.
9122011	9123713	Get your Diablo out of my Silent Hill.
9148695	9149816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9166937	9171578	Yes, and I expected better from this company because they did like the ports of Contra.
9172558	9177939	Well, not ports, but like they did Contra 4 and A Boy and His Blob, the remake.
9178319	9180400	So, I don't know, very disappointed.
9181060	9184120	Let's see, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, quote, I hate Silent Hill.
9184240	9185220	It's not Mass Effect.
9185461	9186901	Shane, back of the box.
9188581	9190141	No, that is not true.
9190201	9192922	I like other things that are not Mass Effect, just not as much.
9195003	9197103	All right, what's the number two thing you want to talk about tonight?
9199144	9199884	Crap, what was it?
9200004	9200884	Oh, Mass Effect.
9201684	9202785	Of course, of course.
9203865	9222929	I am greatly disheartened at the fact that they have confirmed no Shepard for the next game, and they also are saying that it's not going to be like another Shepard-type character, which leads me to think that it may not even be the same style of gameplay, which I'm very, very, very worried about.
9223209	9224629	It should be the saga of Garrus.
9225066	9226247	It's going to be a dancing game.
9247819	9250741	I don't think that means you're going to get this drastically different gameplay.
9250802	9255745	It's just, you know, whatever the niche is about these new consoles, Mass Effect's probably worked it in somehow.
9255846	9262571	I'm just worried that it'll be like an RTS or something that I hate or a sports game or a strategy game.
9262791	9283259	I think it's just gonna be I think it's gonna be very similar but you know it might handle a little differently might play a little differently like just don't expect the same like interface and all that stuff you see in the first one I think it'll be alright give it a chance I'll give it a chance BioWare made Mass Effect 1 after all and 2 and 3 Shane yell at them for me yell at who?
9284426	9287508	Anyone who's involved with my Mass Effect not connecting.
9288629	9290069	I don't know who to yell at for that.
9290149	9291130	She's been trying to play.
9291690	9293671	Funny enough, I know somebody she could yell at.
9293852	9295052	There you go.
9295172	9298014	Rob is your answer.
9300676	9301996	You might know this person, actually.
9302177	9302517	Really?
9303217	9303978	I'll tell you off air.
9304018	9304818	I need my Garrus fix.
9310629	9312470	Jamie's not able to play multiplayer with us instead.
9312530	9313671	I've played some multiplayer.
9313691	9315232	You can't even play single player.
9315833	9317374	I have more achievement points than Alan.
9317414	9317994	How does that work?
9318315	9320916	Or not achievement points, but challenge points, whatever that new thing is.
9322678	9323358	I do not know.
9323919	9329743	BlackWolf is trolling in our chat room saying, a Mass Effect with the writing team of Borderlands and Portal.
9330143	9330443	Want.
9331404	9335487	So, not as good as previous Mass Effect games?
9335867	9336287	I know.
9336308	9337168	Borderlands is a good game.
9337208	9339350	That just means that they'll throw in a lot of dirty humor.
9340256	9340856	I don't want that.
9340916	9342457	I like the seriousness.
9342797	9348278	Technus Reality Check says, unfortunately, Bioware has to finish Dragon Age 3 first.
9348618	9349899	Yeah, no one cares.
9350399	9351319	You know, I care.
9351519	9352239	I like Dragon Age.
9352279	9358081	I didn't like 2, but I'm actually thinking about giving it another shot on some system that I own it on.
9358101	9367244	I don't know which one I'm going to play it on, but I got excited for the information that leaked out, or not leaked out, but that came out about Dragon Age 3.
9367364	9368204	But there's no Garrus.
9369121	9369661	There's no what?
9369862	9370262	Garrus.
9371483	9375086	I'm not all about Garrus like you, so there's no Kayden for me.
9375346	9376187	There's no Kayden.
9376828	9377348	That's true.
9377468	9379690	There are the little weepy emo elf boys.
9380891	9382373	I played one of those in the first game.
9383414	9384074	It was awesome.
9384595	9385235	It wasn't sad.
9386536	9388398	Alright, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Shane?
9390026	9390346	No.
9390826	9391467	Not at all.
9391807	9394128	Well, apparently you broke our stream anyway, so thanks for that.
9394349	9394789	Good.
9395109	9396350	I'm proud of that.
9396470	9396750	All right.
9396790	9397591	Then I'm hanging up on you.
9397631	9397791	Bye.
9398511	9398792	All right.
9398812	9400553	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9401113	9402194	Who am I talking to right now?
9402274	9404695	Nobody, because the stream's not connected, apparently.
9406357	9406677	All right.
9407217	9411940	Well, it did just reconnect, so hopefully some people will hear this and know that the Skype line is open again.
9411960	9413762	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9414082	9415062	Did I say that right?
9415082	9415743	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9415843	9417944	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9419125	9420986	Did we ever figure out if that was the host thing?
9421046	9424368	Because obviously our internet here is not having issues.
9425468	9427069	Yeah, it's not our internet here.
9427409	9434993	It is either... Well, I don't even think it's our connection getting to the server because wouldn't that mean our IRC should go down?
9435794	9437295	Our internet would stop working.
9437335	9440176	You'd get booted from Mass Effect or whatever you're doing in there.
9440396	9441677	All that should happen too, right?
9448987	9465582	I blame New Jersey the entire state let's try to go I think maybe other things don't get disrupted by little internet hiccups but the feed will just shut down if that happens
9467000	9474022	I don't know, anyhow Let's move on Loki, did you have any last minute stories for us?
9474042	9484746	Because I've got some tweets I can do here No, I don't have any Let me go to a tweet from Actdeft that says Oh, the Wii U's first commercial from Europe
9486454	9488795	I didn't know the Wii U. That's actually the commercial.
9488975	9489255	Don't worry.
9489295	9495056	At last, a brand new console with a brand new controller that redefines how you interact with games.
9495356	9496777	So what is Wii U?
9497737	9499697	Shoot at the TV like never before.
9500037	9501998	Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!
9502198	9502698	Nice shooting.
9502898	9505819	And say someone wants to watch TV when you're halfway through a game.
9506119	9507399	I want to watch the TV now.
9508080	9509780	Do both, and everyone's happy.
9512566	9517869	See a different perspective with the gamepad and get closer to your target for a more precise shot.
9520030	9521031	Is this a real commercial?
9521091	9521731	It's a real commercial.
9521831	9524493	It's in here, but I wanted to point out something that I read.
9525633	9534358	Do notice when they say play games that you've never seen before or something like that, and they show Batman Arkham City.
9534639	9536840	The skyline is ringing off the hook, so I need to get one of these calls.
9536860	9537740	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9537760	9538101	Who's this?
9538981	9539742	Hi, can you guys hear me?
9540042	9541402	Ooh, you're very, very quiet.
9541442	9542163	Turn it up a little bit.
9543123	9543603	I'll try.
9543643	9544684	It's just stupid.
9544704	9545624	This guy's being a pain.
9546225	9548906	Yeah, we can barely hear you and the listeners probably can't hear you either.
9549666	9550226	How about now?
9551147	9551967	Nope, you're still quiet.
9553608	9554569	We'll give it one more go.
9555929	9556570	Crank it up.
9558470	9560792	May I have to shout it in this case?
9561032	9562152	We can hear you a little bit.
9562212	9562512	Go ahead.
9562552	9562853	What's up?
9563133	9563533	Who is this?
9564173	9566294	First off, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
9566434	9567855	Hey, DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?
9568581	9570262	Hey, not much.
9570302	9575565	You guys mentioned earlier about you gave a shout out to those who participated in the Extra Life Marathon.
9575705	9575945	Yes.
9576606	9578247	Yeah, I took part in that too for the first time.
9578507	9579467	Congratulations.
9580068	9580588	How'd you do?
9582990	9587412	I lasted for quite a while, but I dozed off at around six something.
9588213	9588713	That's all right.
9589758	9592420	Yeah, but it taught me something very interesting.
9593280	9603587	First off, me and my coworker at work actually managed to raise a decent amount of money in two days because we just got the okay from our job to take part in this.
9603927	9604207	Nice.
9605228	9610772	And second off, it is so hard to do 24 hours of gaming alone.
9611821	9615503	on some games because some games just bored the hell out of me after an hour.
9616343	9617023	How did you do it?
9617063	9624127	Did you try to do one game for the whole 24 hours or were you like, okay, every hour we're going to switch or how did you do that?
9624987	9631430	I switched it up about every one hour or two hours depending on the game and how I was feeling when I'm playing it.
9633522	9633962	I gotcha.
9634783	9635904	So what kind of stuff did you play?
9637866	9638487	Let's see.
9639207	9644332	I haven't re-bought a new game in a while because I'm waiting on a new computer to ship in.
9644952	9651718	So it was mostly stuff that I had to catch up with in my queue, which is quite a lot, but quite old.
9653220	9654000	You know, things like...
9655370	9675320	I was catching up in Arkham Asylum for example then there was Red Dead Redemption things like Mod Nation Racers and even Infamous and then I went to the 360 where I caught up with some Rock Band 3 and things like Virtua Fighter 5 so a lot of modern stuff but that's good and were you live streaming this all?
9675340	9683684	did you stream or were you not or Twitch or whatever one of those sites or were you just kind of doing this at home and trying to get people to sponsor you doing that at home
9684324	9687327	Most of it's on Facebook, and I just stayed at home.
9687807	9693913	I didn't really do the streaming or tweeting because, like I said, it's my first time, so I wasn't exactly sure what to do.
9694173	9694373	Sure.
9694753	9695454	Hey, you know what?
9695654	9701099	And even raising $1 is a great effort for the cause, so congrats to you.
9701419	9704682	Let me ask you, though, how did you go about raising the money?
9704722	9709146	Did you just spam a lot on Facebook, or what was your strategy to get people to care?
9710795	9717079	I had two days to get the money, so I just said, all right, I'm just going to post on Facebook, and whoever gives, whoever gives.
9719081	9720041	I wasn't going to be picky.
9720101	9722864	I'm just like, hey, just whatever you can spare.
9722884	9725125	I don't care if it's a dollar or $2 or $12.
9725165	9727767	It's whatever you can spare.
9727907	9729068	Some of my coworkers gave money.
9729348	9729629	Nice.
9730189	9733371	Well, assuming you're doing it all again next year, what are some things you're going to do differently?
9734532	9736434	Get the okay about a month in advance.
9737990	9742118	and then start doing a fundraising there and asking everybody I can think of.
9743120	9746146	I also would like to see you guys participate as well.
9747406	9755208	You know, it's kind of hard when one of us has a baby to do the 24-hour straight, but we definitely want to get involved in the charity effort.
9755328	9762230	I mean, last year, DarkSakura and I both did a lot with Umlaut, and we're going to do whatever we can to help this year as well.
9762770	9764731	That's something that we're really passionate about.
9764831	9772673	We do want to try to do our own thing outside of the holidays, just because the holiday is a very crowded time for charity, but charity needs TLC 24 or 7, 365.
9775334	9797118	so we do want to do something at some point we think especially with the VOG Network behind us you know get Bobby and Critical Myth and some of the other shows in on it try to do some type of and maybe not necessarily just games we have to really think about this but some type of nerding out for charity and I got we got to really put the put the borders on that but I think there's an idea in there somewhere
9798603	9799404	Ah, I see.
9799864	9802785	That's a good idea, actually.
9802865	9805426	I don't think anybody would say no to geeking out for charity.
9805627	9806267	Exactly.
9806307	9807908	We just have to figure out exactly how to do it.
9808008	9810209	So we'll see what we can do.
9810229	9813850	I just have one more quick question.
9813870	9814711	This is just a quick one.
9815495	9818177	What is it about World of Warcraft that keeps you guys playing?
9818497	9819218	I just want to know that.
9819258	9819718	Pandas.
9821040	9822301	The other people that play.
9823061	9825363	And just, you know, having the community.
9825523	9830307	And I'm not necessarily just talking strangers, but like friends or people that have become my friends through the game.
9831208	9835351	Just, you know, being able to log in and say, hey, it's a chat room with fireballs and swords.
9836472	9837092	I like that.
9837453	9838313	That's exactly it.
9838754	9838974	All right.
9838994	9839715	Well, take care, buddy.
9839855	9840295	Have a good one.
9840315	9840936	You too.
9840956	9841076	Thanks.
9841096	9841696	Thanks for the call.
9841816	9842817	And thanks for doing Extra Life.
9842857	9843237	That's great.
9843958	9844358	Anytime.
9844378	9844679	All right.
9844719	9844979	Take care.
9846567	9848268	Yeah, we do need to get in on more stuff like that.
9848308	9848568	We do.
9849549	9851391	But, you know, there's a lot of charity events.
9851411	9855273	We can't do them all, but we'll plug wherever we can.
9855594	9856114	Absolutely.
9858143	9860804	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9860824	9864325	I'm falling way behind on some of these Twitter stories, so let me get to some other ones of these here.
9864925	9867566	Tigerclaw sends a few over here.
9868586	9873068	One saying, UK man faces jail time for selling counterfeit Nintendo games.
9873208	9874848	Oh, I'd read about this previously.
9875528	9880690	A 41-year-old Justin Success Brooks, well, not living up to his middle name right now,
9881670	9889453	Apparently, he did fraudulent sale of counterfeit Nintendo games, this is all allegedly, according to the Criot and Guardian.
9890073	9895055	He was caught in an investigation conducted by Nintendo and then the UK Interactive Entertainment Association.
9895695	9899236	He trafficked illegal Nintendo goods from 2009 and 2011.
9900056	9903517	He made almost a million dollars in US dollars.
9903537	9904338	It was about 600,000 pounds.
9905858	9931724	selling counterfeit Wii DS and DSi games he was charged with seven counts of fraud two counts of fraudulent trading two counts of supplying an article to use in a fraud two counts of unauthorized possession of goods bearing a trademark and one count of unauthorized use of the trademark is what that all boils down to he did plead guilty to all counts he's awaiting sentencing boy oh boy all right let's do one more call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
9932998	9934679	Hey, this is Braginator.
9935039	9936320	Hey, what's up, Braginator?
9936340	9937201	Haven't heard from you in a while.
9938021	9939723	Yeah, I know, it's kind of a long story.
9940263	9946928	I kind of posted on what's been going on on the blog forum, so I won't rehash that.
9946988	9947368	Fair enough.
9947388	9947848	Well, what's up?
9947908	9948449	What's on your mind?
9949329	9955153	Well, I, God forbid, I actually got my first PC game last weekend.
9955173	9958435	It's kind of an older title, but definitely good one.
9958455	9960177	I think you guys would approve Diablo 2.
9961792	9963333	That is a classic.
9963793	9964913	That is a classic.
9965573	9971356	And in fact, you should just keep playing that one and pretend it's 3 because then you'll be more satisfied.
9971376	9972916	Oh, I'm trolling, I'm trolling.
9973496	9974977	Making the Diablo 3 fans mad.
9975577	9983520	Truth be told, seeing that I don't have access to a PlayStation 3 for the time being, I need something to play.
9983540	9987241	I was sure that Diablo 2 would run on my machine.
9988062	9989082	Saw that at the store.
9989122	9991023	I kind of figured, what the heck, pick it up.
9992375	9995296	So you're playing the classics right now.
9995656	9999258	What made you choose Diablo 2 out of all the games you could have picked out there?
10000519	10004921	Well, I wanted to get a game legally as opposed to some kind of torrent.
10004941	10006501	So torrents were out.
10009851	10016197	Some of the edutainment titles they would give for kids definitely don't appeal to me.
10016817	10029429	I'm pretty sure that even though my new computer is a little bit more high-tech than my old computer that was stolen, games like Grand Theft Auto and whatnot probably won't run on my computer.
10030430	10033873	So I kind of figured, all right, Diablo II is what?
10035969	10037650	It might even be older than that, actually.
10037690	10038630	But yeah, it's old.
10038871	10039291	Very old.
10050831	10051792	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10068573	10069734	Basically, yes.
10069754	10073836	I need to put a new battery in it.
10073856	10077837	Don't set fire to your house when it's crying out for a low battery.
10077897	10078658	Just be careful.
10079098	10081059	Oh my god, how do you sleep with that going?
10082769	10084990	Well, I learned to tune it out, actually, so... Yeah, well...
10105293	10111755	And I don't engage in any kind of dangerous activities in my place, but I never know what my neighbors... That's right.
10111795	10114535	Your neighbors might be smoking marijuana, and you don't even know.
10114635	10114915	All right.
10115636	10119857	Look, the thing I really wanted to tell you about was you should check out this website.
10120177	10131139	If you're interested in getting games legally, especially old stuff that will play on your computer and, you know, safe, I would look into a website called GOG.com, and that's G-O-G.com.
10131159	10133460	It's Good Old Games, and they sell...
10133900	10139885	tons of old stuff and a lot of it goes for like five bucks, seven bucks and there's some really good stuff in there.
10139905	10144509	In fact, they're trying to kind of cash in on the indie bundle craze right now.
10144990	10157280	Not that it's really an indie bundle per se but they have like an interplay bundle going on right now where for like 35 bucks you can get like 50 games and there's some classics in there like Descent and Castles which was a game I used to play.
10157841	10161044	It's a great website and I have to recommend it.
10161664	10168965	Yeah, and Dungeon Buster says... Another game that I probably should get back into is World of Warcraft, if only because
10170009	10176953	I did download the clients and go compare and try to play although the framing was extremely choppy.
10177233	10180475	Well, you can say goodbye to your life if you get back into World of Warcraft.
10181255	10183917	No, but well, the graphics have come a long way.
10186298	10189319	More powerful.
10189339	10190340	The game will be better.
10192461	10192721	All right.
10192981	10197024	Well, Ragenazer, I need to let you go so we can wrap things up, but take care and have fun with Diablo 2.
10197947	10199087	take care, bye bye
10216352	10221998	But let's all hope that Ragenator gets the battery replaced and a smoke detector soon.
10222338	10223999	Alright, moving on.
10224140	10227182	I need to do the rest of these Twitter topics because there's still a bunch of these here.
10227503	10229765	So I did the one about Tigerclaw and the counterfeit time.
10230486	10232327	Let me read one other tweet from Tigerclaw.
10232367	10233408	He sent a couple others.
10234589	10237132	Usually I do a two-tweet max, but these are both pretty good.
10238053	10238173	Um...
10240845	10244228	This is about the Zynga lawsuit that was settled.
10245349	10248812	Zynga sued the makers of Pyramidville because they used the word ville.
10249152	10250653	Kobojo was the name of the company.
10251794	10255317	They actually settled and Pyramidville is now Pyramid Valley.
10255837	10256898	So I can't believe it.
10256938	10257439	They caved.
10258660	10259520	Oh well.
10259861	10260341	Poor guys.
10260802	10264424	Alright, here's the other one from Tiger Claw that I think is definitely worth reporting on here.
10264885	10269168	Apparently there's a Steam vulnerability that can lead to a remote insertion of malicious code.
10269208	10276214	Now don't panic, for God's sake, but you know when Steam gets a hole poked in it, a lot of people are going to be talking about it.
10276594	10279377	So apparently there's a vulnerability in the Steam browser.
10279397	10280878	Does Steam come out when you poke a hole in it?
10284701	10286682	But it's the Steam browser protocol.
10286722	10292605	When you use, instead of like HTTP to go to a website, you use Steam colon slash slash to go to a website.
10293125	10297467	If you can get a user to click on a link for a specially formed Steam URL,
10297907	10306455	An attacker can remotely exploit buffer overflow bugs and other vulnerabilities in Steam games and Steam itself to get malicious code on a target's machine.
10306535	10308877	So please be careful what you click on.
10308917	10312841	But knowing Valve, this shit is probably already patched.
10313061	10315143	We're going to be on it very soon.
10315604	10316845	So there you go.
10317285	10319027	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10338124	10339505	So very cute.
10339625	10339905	Love it.
10340605	10341846	It is available for download.
10341866	10346228	The only place you're going to find it is on the forums at vognetwork.com slash forums.
10346609	10350931	Check the Orange Lounge Radio Forum for the President Cat Pong download.
10351011	10352011	Good job, Dark Tetsuya.
10353772	10354212	Actdeft.
10355393	10361435	tweets about Forza Horizon's rally expansion and Street Pass, oh, Season Pass, excuse me.
10362415	10365016	Forza Horizon, of course, is launching on October 23rd.
10366277	10374079	Apparently, what's happening with this, for 1,600 Microsoft points, you can get the Forza Horizon rally expansion pack.
10374299	10378841	It is included with the Season Pass, however, and I guess you get...
10380347	10385469	An off-road racing experience with deeper ruts, higher jumps, and new surface types to explore.
10385829	10387309	It's an add-on pack for Forza.
10387850	10388670	What else do you need to know?
10388690	10389730	Look at them shiny cars.
10390651	10391911	Look at them shiny, pretty cars.
10393431	10395452	I am terrible at Forza, just for the record.
10396813	10400454	SSJ100Matt sent that same link about Skyrim at Rice University.
10401334	10403215	Bummer, we already talked about that.
10404555	10405536	That's it for Twitter topics.
10406176	10408296	How about Loki?
10408316	10409857	Did you have anything else you wanted to throw out there?
10410280	10412602	No, I have nothing.
10424875	10427076	A new system software update for PlayStation 3, 4.3.
10428937	10432138	We'll make changes to how trophies are displayed on your PlayStation 3.
10432818	10435719	It's now in the PlayStation Network on the cross media bar.
10435919	10436299	All right.
10437320	10437720	Let's see.
10438540	10445783	Also, by the beginning of November 2012, we will retire the services available through the Life with PlayStation application.
10446223	10450205	We will stop offering the Life with PlayStation application to new users with the 4.3 update.
10451465	10480692	this includes the conclusion of our participation with Stanford University's Folding at Home over 15 million users participated in the program they've donated more than 100 million computation hours to the Folding at Home project considering the contribution PS3 has made to the project we decided to retire it as a result of discussions with Stanford University so at least it wasn't like they just yanked the plug but I guess it was a mutual decision that's kind of interesting
10481273	10483243	Did they find the cure of what they were looking for?
10483304	10483826	I hope so.
10486423	10493405	Well, at least it was a mutual decision, but I hope it wasn't one of those mutual decision meaning Sony went to Stanford saying, this is what we're going to do.
10493805	10495045	Tell us how you're going to deal with it.
10496246	10496566	I don't know.
10496766	10498166	It seems like it was a good thing.
10498186	10499887	Beg for us to change your mind.
10499947	10500287	Right?
10500907	10501167	No?
10502127	10502547	Fine.
10504028	10505008	So, all right.
10506188	10507769	So, that's all I've got.
10508009	10509629	So, you don't have any more last minute stories?
10510369	10511750	I don't have any more last minute stories?
10511870	10513090	I think that means we're at the end of the show.
10513110	10514370	Windows 8's out this week, right?
10515051	10515711	Excited?
10516431	10516972	No.
10517032	10517132	No.
10517152	10517552	No.
10538713	10544757	Also, of course, kind words on iTunes reviews, Stitcher promotions, things like that.
10544917	10546739	Other iOS devices.
10546879	10547679	What other apps are there?
10547719	10548220	TuneIn.
10548440	10549260	I can't even think of them all.
10549280	10549741	There's so many.
10549781	10550581	And Android, too.
10551963	10555185	Alan has one I've never even heard of that he uses to listen to podcasts, and it's pretty good.
10555565	10559048	So wherever you heard about Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.
10559088	10559788	We appreciate it.
10560769	10562931	And, of course, support all the shows on VOG Network.
10563331	10564592	VOGnetwork.com.
10564612	10573161	We got a ton of great shows on the network all week long talking about various geek things, not just gaming shows, but TV shows and movies.
10573302	10576885	Well, no dedicated movie shows yet, but some of them talk about movies.
10577987	10581610	Things about British TV culture, anime shows, Warcraft shows.
10582251	10583352	It's all there, VOGnetwork.com.
10584493	10586034	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10586674	10587694	Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
10587714	10588274	Your final thought.
10588534	10598017	Well, Lisa, if you're going to use Windows 8, there's Start 8 by Stardock that'll actually put the Start menu back so it's not so broken.
10600257	10600658	Okay.
10602278	10603578	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10604539	10606639	I'm still pissed that I can't play Mass Effect.
10607599	10608260	Still so pissed.
10608280	10608840	As you should be.
10610340	10612201	And I miss my kitty.
10612901	10613341	I'm sorry.
10614505	10614805	Alright.
10615586	10619948	Well, my final thought is I'm hungry and I can't wait for dinner.
10620908	10624911	And it's really too bad that I haven't eaten dinner yet because you know what even sounds better than dinner is Pinkberry.
10626431	10627052	Maybe later this week.
10627072	10627712	Pinkberry for dinner.
10628212	10628933	Pinkberry for dinner.
10629033	10629313	Someday.
10629915	10631476	Also, and I have one more final thought.
10632477	10635038	RuPaul's All-Stars Drag Race starts tomorrow, just so you know.
10636179	10637660	Just so you know.
10637680	10638921	Judging you.
10639241	10640142	Here's the disappointing thing.
10640162	10642764	You can watch the first episode online right up to the elimination.
10643504	10644044	It's okay.
10644705	10645886	It wasn't as good as it should be.
10646526	10647306	I hate the twist.
10647487	10648407	I hate the twist.
10648827	10650288	Reality TV twists are stupid.
10651349	10651949	Alright, that's it.
10651989	10655752	If I haven't scared you off already, thanks for tuning into the show and downloading and listening to us.
10656112	10656953	We really appreciate it.
10657213	10658213	Have a wonderful week.
10658293	10659814	We'll be back to do it all again next time.
10659894	10660835	Good night!
10661778	10664800	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
