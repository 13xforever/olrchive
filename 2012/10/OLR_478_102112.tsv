14000	19000	Tonight, October 21, 2012, Xbox will soon unfriend two of their social applications.
19000	27000	More Sega games are being re-released as download titles, and a PC game ships without the necessary activation keys.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 478, October 21, 2012.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.
50000	54000	Welcome back, big welcome back to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	57000	Hello, you've been out for two weeks.
57000	58000	Yes.
58000	60000	You went from like really good stuff to really not so good stuff.
60000	63000	Disneyland, let's focus on Disneyland. How was Disneyland?
63000	65000	It was gay.
65000	68000	I'm glad you had a happy time.
68000	77000	Well, we didn't actually go into the park on Saturday because our good friend and listener got into a little bit of an accident.
77000	78000	But he's okay, right?
78000	79000	He's okay.
79000	81000	When you first told me that I was like, oh my god, but he's fine, right?
81000	85000	The car came out a little tire poppy.
85000	89000	Things we learn in our lives, cars are just cars. People are people.
89000	92000	Exactly. Dan and I had a fantastic time regardless.
92000	97000	And when I came home, now I'm going to get into the horrible part.
97000	98000	Okay.
98000	101000	When I came home, Shermy was sick.
101000	104000	She wasn't eating very much. She sounded a little raspy.
104000	107000	And she kept going into the den and just sitting there.
107000	111000	And we thought that maybe she just couldn't get back up the step because of her hips.
111000	118000	So finally I just picked her up and brought her into the computer room with me and took a towel out of the dryer and wrapped her up in it.
118000	120000	So she was all warm and she loved it. She was a-
120000	121000	A purrito.
121000	122000	A purrito.
122000	126000	And she even curled over and with an ear poking out.
126000	128000	I've got pictures on Facebook. I'll repost them in the chat.
128000	134000	But it was, she finally started doing better and started eating again.
134000	139000	So I, you know, put her back in her room and, you know, made sure her towel was in there with her.
139000	143000	And, you know, I let her come into the computer room whenever she wanted.
143000	150000	And Tuesday, like around midnight or so, she, well actually, yeah, it would be Tuesday.
150000	155000	She was half in the laundry room and half out in the hall.
155000	157000	And she batted my foot.
157000	159000	And so I stopped and petted her.
159000	163000	And, you know, we had a good cuddle and she purred. She was a little wheezy when she purred.
163000	166000	I was like, I was the old lady kitty, you know.
166000	172000	Round two o'clock, I was actually about to go to bed and I went to look for the cat to pet her good night.
172000	174000	Because I always pet Jeremy good night.
174000	177000	And she was in the living room dead.
177000	181000	Just laying on her side and I couldn't tell if she was breathing because she was so fat.
181000	186000	And I went in and she was still warm and so I couldn't really tell.
186000	191000	But the moment, there's like a muscle tone that you can feel the difference.
191000	199000	And yeah, so, um, Shermie, I'd have to say she probably died around 1.30 in the morning.
199000	202000	Based on her temperature and everything.
202000	207000	And the fact that, you know, she had, rigor mortis doesn't set in for like a few hours anyway.
207000	209000	So, um, yeah, Shermie died.
209000	212000	She was 15.
212000	216000	Actually, we redid the math and she was probably 16.
216000	219000	Because I got her when she was a year and a half old.
219000	222000	So, which would have put her birthday in October.
222000	224000	So, she was 16.
224000	228000	Now, just so some of our newer listeners know and I do at some point.
228000	230000	Let me just say hello to Tech Master Loki.
230000	232000	So, you don't have to sit there all quiet and unintroduced.
232000	234000	But obviously, Jamie had a pretty busy week.
234000	236000	So, I know she wanted to talk. So, hi, Loki.
236000	237000	Hi.
237000	241000	Okay, going back to what's going on with you, Dark Sakura.
241000	243000	In case the newer listeners don't know.
243000	247000	Because, you know, we've been taping where we're at now for about a year, almost now.
247000	248000	Probably a year and a half.
248000	250000	But we used to tape the show at your house.
250000	253000	We've actually taped the show at like five different places in the ten year history.
253000	254000	But we did tape the show at your house.
254000	257000	And you, obviously, you had Shermie.
257000	262000	And Shermie was pretty notorious on the show for sleeping at my feet and so forth.
262000	264000	Her bed was under the table.
264000	266000	And you would sometimes put the mic down near her and say,
266000	268000	What do you think about that, Shermie?
268000	269000	And she would actually go,
270000	271000	Her hair goes,
272000	273000	Exactly.
273000	274000	Or a,
275000	277000	So, yes, this does affect the show in many ways.
277000	282000	And, of course, there was a very infamous moment that happened at one point on the show.
282000	284000	That I want to bring up a clip of here.
284000	287000	And I really want to thank Dark Tetsuya for finding this clip for me.
287000	292000	But this is a clip from, I think he said it was episode number 357?
292000	293000	Yeah.
293000	295000	This is old. This is old. Here it is.
295000	297000	Well, what's that, Jamie?
297000	298000	Nothing. I was talking about Shermie.
298000	299000	Oh.
299000	300000	Shermie just crapped.
300000	301000	Oh, did she?
301000	302000	That was her review of the show.
303000	304000	Nice.
305000	306000	That was us talking about the tester.
307000	308000	Yeah.
308000	311000	And Shermie notoriously took a poo on the floor and gave her review of the show.
311000	314000	Well, it was like her secondary poop spot was,
316000	319000	I've told people this before, Shermie had arthritis in her hips.
319000	323000	And so when she could manage to pee in her box,
323000	327000	she just couldn't poop properly in her box because she couldn't actually physically get in her box.
328000	333000	So sometimes she would just wait till people were around and take poop in the hall.
333000	335000	Look, I have shat.
336000	337000	To call attention to it.
338000	344000	But what was funny is that like after Dan picked up Shermie and put her,
344000	349000	we actually put her in her bed because we couldn't keep her bed, you know.
349000	355000	She wore it out actually and put her in a box and Dan had the box on the back porch
355000	357000	because it was, you know, really early in the morning.
358000	363000	And he said that she was laying in state on the back porch and found poo on his shoe.
363000	365000	It was her last thing.
365000	366000	So that was her last act.
366000	369000	Her last act was to crap on Dan's converses.
369000	376000	And then Dan let me sleep in the next day and he went to have her cremated.
376000	381000	Because actually in Citrus Heights, if a pet is under 15 pounds,
381000	383000	then you can just throw them in the dump.
383000	386000	And he's like, the moment he told me that, I freaked out.
386000	388000	I knew he wouldn't do it, but I freaked out.
388000	390000	He's like, I'll take care of her in the morning.
390000	394000	The fuck you will. I can hear you in my head having that fight.
394000	400000	And so they actually, it was like a communal cremation and they scatter the ashes in the foothills.
400000	404000	So I was like, well, she's with other people's, you know, loved pets.
404000	407000	Well, a lot of love for you in our chat room as well.
407000	410000	Live.vognetwork.com.
410000	412000	Critical Myth, RIP Shermie.
412000	414000	Orange Rite, RIP Shermie.
414000	416000	Act Deaf, you shall be missed.
416000	418000	DDR dollar bill, still want to say sorry about Shermie.
418000	420000	City Vampire, I'm sorry Dark Sakura.
420000	422000	Dark Tetsuya, RIP Shermie.
422000	425000	Black Wolf, Shermie had amazing parents.
425000	428000	So, you know, lots of love from the listeners as well.
428000	431000	So sorry. I know it's, I know it's hard.
431000	433000	It's okay.
433000	438000	Well, you know, and I had, we had a feeling that it was coming because I mean,
438000	442000	I really felt like she was winding down, but I didn't think it was going to happen.
442000	445000	You know, a week after, you know, I get back from Disneyland.
445000	447000	Sure.
447000	449000	But what a lucky damn cat.
449000	452000	What a lucky damn cat because you guys rescued her and she has,
452000	456000	she's not only loved by you and Dan, but look at all these peeps on the internet.
456000	457000	Yeah.
457000	458000	I'll tell you.
458000	459000	Most cats aren't so lucky.
459000	462000	I'll tell you what was funny too is that I was actually, because you know,
462000	465000	last, basically when I wasn't here Sunday,
465000	469000	since I had cramps so debilitating, I could not walk.
469000	471000	I mean, it was literally,
471000	475000	I felt like someone had put my girl bits in a vice and, you know,
475000	476000	was trying to get orange juice from them.
476000	477000	La la la la la.
477000	478000	Okay.
478000	482000	But I had, I ended up just sitting down on the floor, you know,
482000	485000	cause I couldn't move and it was the most comfortable spot.
485000	489000	And Shermy patted right over and she liked to sit in between my legs for some
489000	491000	weird reason and put her head on my thigh,
491000	494000	which I've got pictures of her doing it and sticking out her tongue and being
494000	495000	cute.
495000	496000	And, um,
496000	501000	she just sat in my lap like that for like an hour and we just hung out.
501000	506000	And well, you know, not to be, not to be morbid,
506000	509000	but maybe she knew, you know, they know, you know,
509000	513000	when a cat knows that he or she is going to go, they,
513000	517000	they stop eating, they go to the same spot over again.
517000	519000	And I was getting that feeling with Shermy.
519000	522000	That's why the first time I picked her up and brought her in the computer
522000	524000	room with me and she was like, Oh, okay,
524000	528000	I'm fine. But she was funny.
528000	530000	She wouldn't eat her regular cat food,
530000	532000	but she'd still eat the treats from my fingers.
532000	538000	I have video of that too on Facebook of her eating treats and making the
538000	541000	kitty wants nom face.
541000	546000	And so my baby, well, we're not going to get another cat.
546000	549000	Yeah, I know that's the number one thing people want to ask kind of like,
549000	551000	when are you going to get another one? But it's, you're not ready, right?
551000	552000	If you're not ready, you're not ready.
552000	557000	Yeah. And like I've had people offer me, you know, rescues and,
557000	561000	and I'm perfectly fine. You know, I would love to take in a good rescue,
561000	566000	but it's also, you know,
566000	571000	and I hate to put it in terms like this, but are you going to,
571000	574000	you know, immediately replace your cousin if they die?
574000	576000	I'm going to go to the store and buy a new cousin.
576000	579000	Or if one of your friends, you know, she's,
579000	583000	she's a member of my family and maybe it's, you know,
583000	586000	some people just like, Oh, it's just a cat. You can get another cat.
586000	590000	I'm like, but they have their own personalities and they,
590000	594000	I had her for 14 years. Sure. And it's a teenager. Yeah,
594000	597000	she will. She's a whole lady. Really. Let's see.
597000	601000	14 years ago was PlayStation one, right? Yeah. It was about that era.
601000	604000	Dreamcast. That's when there's some Dreamcast are coming into your house.
604000	609000	Yeah. Sure. Me used to, um, to sniff at the VMUs. I remember that.
609000	613000	But, um, I mean, you know, she, uh,
613000	618000	she's a good cat. Well, yes, it is a video game show you guys,
618000	621000	but sometimes, you know, she's named after a video game to shut up.
621000	624000	That's true. She is named after a video game. Who is sure me for those that may
624000	627000	not know. Well, um, she, uh,
627000	629000	sure me was one of the characters in the king of fighter series,
629000	633000	the one with the dancer type with the hair in front of her eyes.
633000	637000	But when we got sure me, um, the adoption paper said Sherman, I was like,
637000	640000	I'm not even my cat Sherman need a little dinner.
640000	643000	She would become the size of a Sherman tank. But, um,
643000	648000	so, uh, and I wasn't necessarily going to name her after Sherman from,
648000	650000	you know, uh, Mr. Peabody.
650000	655000	So she'd go back in the way back machine. But, um, she,
655000	657000	we were like, well, we need a good name for her.
657000	660000	And so sure me popped up and it seemed to fit her.
660000	663000	You know, she wasn't, she was graceful at one time,
663000	668000	one time and I'm going to go AFK a minute.
668000	671000	So it's fine. Um, at some point go say hi to the chatters.
671000	675000	They have a lot of very kind things to say and I think will help. Um,
675000	677000	but thank you for sharing the story. And, uh, you know,
677000	682000	if you do a show for 478 episodes, we're on that 478, you know,
682000	684000	the listeners start to start to get to know you.
684000	687000	We start to get to know them and we want to share these big moments.
687000	690000	And we liked Shermy. We love Shermy. Oh, come on.
690000	692000	She was, I remember when she actually,
692000	694000	cause she would sit on my feet sometimes.
694000	698000	I remember when she actually got out of her box and sat on your foot out of
698000	701000	her bed. So, uh, Duke Nukem in our chat room puts it very well.
701000	704000	Video game podcast or not. Life isn't all about video games.
704000	706000	Sometimes stuff like that happens and intervenes for the games.
706000	708000	And we all understand. No, I know you guys understand.
708000	711000	I'm saying that mostly for the benefit of the new people who might be here.
711000	712000	You know,
712000	714000	LR for the first time because you know,
714000	716000	every week somebody is going to hear it for the first time.
716000	718000	Like what is this show? I just downloaded.
718000	720000	All they talk about is dead animals. Ah, but it's,
720000	722000	it's much more than that guys.
722000	724000	Hopefully that story kind of tells you, uh,
724000	727000	the family that we've built up here over the years. So Shermy,
727000	729000	Shermy is my baby. Yeah. Especially,
729000	732000	and I'm just to share a little personal thing. I mean, I,
732000	735000	I Dan and I've been trying for a couple of years to,
735000	736000	you know,
736000	738000	share a little bit of the story with you guys.
738000	742000	I Dan and I've been trying for a couple of years to, you know, conceive.
742000	747000	Well, mostly I've been doing the work because all right,
747000	749000	we'll leave it at that. Yes. We, we all know what you mean.
749000	753000	I hate when people go, we're pregnant when really the wife is pregnant.
753000	756000	You're not carrying that baby dude. Shut up. Yes.
756000	761000	But he has to put up with you. Yeah. Am I right? Am I right?
762000	767000	Yeah. But, um, but I mean,
767000	771000	Shermy was pretty much, you know, if without that cat,
771000	774000	I think I would have been a big wreck. So, and now I'm like,
774000	777000	I don't want any kids. I just want more cats,
777000	780000	but I'm clearly not going to get another cat at least until after we moved from
780000	784000	the house, which will be after December. Understand. And I'm gonna,
784000	788000	and I'm gonna be a rescue just to give a little a plug here. Um,
788000	792000	the, uh, animal outreach, um, out here in California,
792000	796000	they're actually in Placer County. They are a no kill shelter.
796000	800000	That's where I took Donut or bat cat or Bruce, whatever people want to call him.
800000	804000	There's a little kitten I rescued from the dumpster outside my synagogue. Um,
804000	805000	they are no kill shelter.
805000	810000	They get animals fixed shots and take them to pet smarts to have them adopted
810000	813000	out. And, um, I would say, uh,
813000	816000	anyone in the Northern California area, give them your support.
816000	820000	If you're going to get a cat or a dog, um, go through animal outreach.
820000	822000	They're really good people. So, uh,
822000	825000	black Wolf in our chat room says, for those of us without kids,
825000	826000	our pets are our kids.
826000	830000	I put up just as many pictures on Facebook of my babies as my friends do of
830000	833000	their babies. I think that's a really good point. So when I,
833000	836000	when I come back, I'll spam chat with pictures of Shermy.
836000	841000	Sounds great. Or, um, we need to know our pet community of some sort.
841000	845000	Maybe I'll make a, uh, let's, why don't we have a tumbler, a pet tumbler,
846000	850000	pet tumbler. You figure you, you, you work out all them specifics and we'll,
850000	852000	we'll work that. We'll name this episode cat shit.
852000	855000	Raginator says we should dedicate this episode to the memory of Shermy.
855000	858000	Absolutely. Cat poop. Cat poop. What?
858000	859000	We'll name it cat poop.
859000	860000	Let's probably take it.
860000	863000	Did you hear what Raginator said? We should dedicate this episode.
863000	864000	Fuck yeah cat poop.
867000	868000	All right. Anyhow.
868000	870000	Shermy used to crawl into bed with me too.
871000	876000	We are at our box Springs broke for awhile and Shermy would crawl under the,
876000	879000	cause Dan and I use separate covers cause we're both cover hogs and she'd
879000	881000	crawl under and lay her head on my shoulder.
881000	885000	And when she saw that I was awake, she'd start purring.
885000	886000	And so she was my alarm clock.
887000	889000	Act definitely in our chat room says pets a gram. You know, there's a good,
889000	892000	there, there's a good point to that. Um, without deviating too much.
892000	896000	I finally did the sheep thing and I got an iPhone five over the weekend.
896000	898000	Jamie's husband sold it to me.
900000	904000	Hey, you know what? My four, the button was broken, the camera was broken.
904000	906000	So I haven't had a camera on my phone for like a year.
906000	909000	So what's the first thing I did with my iPhone five?
909000	910000	Take cat pictures.
910000	913000	We downloaded Instagram, took a picture of Morocco and the kitty bed and put,
913000	914000	I'm back.
914000	918000	So, so you decided to purchase another phone from a company whose phone broke
918000	919000	in a couple of years.
919000	920000	Yes.
920000	921000	Awesome.
921000	922000	Well, I didn't, I admittedly,
922000	925000	I didn't use a case or anything protective with it and that was,
925000	929000	that's a long story, but uh, yeah, it's kind of my own fault.
929000	930000	Get an OtterBox.
930000	934000	Funny enough, I am, uh, uh, Alan bought one for me.
934000	938000	Good, because OtterBox is, seriously, I'm, I'm on my second.
938000	940000	OtterBox is not because the last one broke.
940000	946000	It was because actually the, uh, rubber surrounding it broke and not the, uh,
946000	947000	thing itself.
947000	951000	All right. Let's, let's get into video games a little bit.
951000	953000	Before we get to our gaming weeks, we usually have a kickoff topic.
953000	955000	Obviously we've already been talking a little bit,
955000	957000	but let's have a game related kickoff topic.
957000	961000	Loki, I'm going to put you on the spot because you put up this very cryptic
961000	965000	tweet over the last week and obviously I perked up because it had the word
965000	969000	Disney in it. So Loki, I don't know if now's the time you can tell me to F off,
969000	973000	but what is this tweet all about? You said Disney universe?
973000	974000	Disney infinity.
974000	977000	Oh, excuse me. Disney, Disney infinity. What is Disney infinity?
977000	980000	Disney infinity is a new property from Disney.
980000	983000	It's coming out next year in the spring or summer.
983000	986000	Um, it's going to start tying in with all their movies that they come out with,
986000	991000	um, animated and stuff, including rereleases record Ralph. Uh,
991000	995000	no, it's like I said, next year. So next year's, Oh,
995000	996000	cause like they're going to release,
996000	1000000	isn't little mermaid on deck to be rereleased and I don't think that's the next
1000000	1004000	one. Um, I think it's cars actually. Really? Okay. Yeah.
1004000	1008000	I think that's the next Pixar movie to be done like in 3d or something.
1008000	1009000	But, um,
1009000	1013000	basically cause I don't know too much about it yet and there's a lot of
1013000	1017000	speculation, um, to what it is. And I mean, I know a little bit,
1017000	1021000	but, um, it's basically their version of Skylanders.
1021000	1025000	So it's a game of some sort. I assume some sort of venture game,
1025000	1026000	although I don't really know what it is,
1026000	1029000	but it's got figures that, you know,
1029000	1033000	kind of work with some sort of device to be able to play as those characters.
1033000	1036000	But this is Disney we're talking about. This is not just,
1036000	1039000	it's a made up spyro, you know, made up characters that had Spyro in it,
1039000	1042000	but now it doesn't even really have Spyro in it. It's going to be, you know,
1042000	1046000	well known franchises. So they're starting off with like, um,
1046000	1049000	some weird stuff. You would think it's like Mickey mouse and all that stuff.
1049000	1051000	Maybe those are in like the starter kits or something like that,
1051000	1056000	but it's basically, uh, the cars characters. Um,
1056000	1060000	there's also pirates of the Caribbean characters and,
1060000	1063000	um, what else was it?
1063000	1067000	Later on in the fall, they're going to be doing stuff for, uh, Frozen,
1067000	1069000	which is their new animated movie. Right, right.
1069000	1071000	That's their big movie for next year.
1071000	1076000	I didn't realize Wreck-It Ralph is the one Disney classic picture this year.
1076000	1079000	When we were talking about it last week, I didn't realize that,
1079000	1082000	but I did some research after the show and like Disney tends to put out one
1082000	1086000	animated classic a year. Last year it was the redo of Winnie the Pooh.
1086000	1089000	This year it is Wreck-It Ralph. Last year was, um,
1089000	1093000	Tangled. No, Tangled was two years ago at this point because technically it came
1093000	1097000	out Christmas of, uh, the year, the year before. Hmm. Yeah.
1097000	1100000	Last year was Winnie the Pooh and this year is Wreck-It Ralph and next year is
1100000	1104000	this Frozen. Yeah. So Frozen and, um,
1104000	1106000	they've had some other stuff. Uh,
1106000	1110000	some of the characters I did see that they mentioned, Jack Skellington, um,
1110000	1113000	Mickey from, you know, the whole, uh,
1113000	1115000	Sorcerer's Apprentice stuff. Um,
1115000	1118000	they said like Sorcerer Mickey or something like that. Well,
1118000	1121000	as much as like, I might want to sit here and roll my eyes.
1121000	1125000	It does make a heck of a lot of sense for Disney to cash in on that.
1125000	1129000	I mean, obviously, you know, you, you, you put the nail on the head.
1129000	1132000	Spyro and Skylanders say what you will about the game and so forth.
1132000	1135000	It makes them an assload of money when you don't even know these characters.
1135000	1138000	You, nobody has any attachment to the characters.
1138000	1139000	And, um,
1139000	1140000	it's like,
1140000	1143000	it makes them an assload of money when you don't even know these characters.
1143000	1145000	You, nobody has any attachment to these characters.
1145000	1147000	These characters were made up for this game.
1147000	1151000	Spyro being the one lone distant exception, but I don't even,
1151000	1153000	he's not even mentioned anymore,
1153000	1158000	nor on the cover of the next and put Spyro side by side with Mickey mouse.
1158000	1161000	I mean, come or J or Jack Skellington or,
1161000	1164000	or any of the characters and the power of the people that, you know,
1164000	1166000	you think people, you know, are,
1167000	1170000	are consumer whores over Skylanders characters.
1170000	1174000	You do not even understand how many consumer whores there are for anything
1174000	1177000	Disney. If you look, I mean, Disney did have that game.
1177000	1179000	Maybe that was the one that was called Disney universe.
1179000	1183000	I did have that game last year that was, you know, it was, it was okay.
1183000	1187000	I mean, it wasn't like gonna win any best game of the year awards or anything,
1187000	1192000	but for a family game, you pick up, go it, it served its purpose.
1192000	1193000	It was fine, you know,
1193000	1198000	so I could totally see that type of engine and that game taken on this,
1198000	1200000	you know, cause that game was set up,
1200000	1203000	it had a very little big planet esque element to it where you could kind of
1203000	1205000	dress the characters up. And so far, I mean,
1205000	1208000	it wasn't as detailed as little big planet, but like, um, you know,
1208000	1212000	tiger call on chat saying no Tron characters. Well, this is not yet.
1212000	1214000	This is only, they only have, you know,
1214000	1216000	the first and second wave stuff announced.
1216000	1218000	So for me Disney universe did have the Tron character,
1218000	1222000	how little big planet actually had, they still could do that stuff.
1222000	1224000	It's just, I mean, they think about it,
1224000	1226000	like they probably have a Tron movie in the works.
1226000	1229000	I know they have another Tron movie probably in a couple of years.
1229000	1233000	And so if not an animated movie or something to cash in on that,
1233000	1235000	that animated series is pretty awesome,
1235000	1238000	which I guess it restarted recently and I have to go catch up.
1238000	1240000	Did they, uh, did they renew it for another season? I hope so.
1240000	1242000	I don't know if it's a new season or if it's the second half,
1242000	1246000	like the fall season or something like that, but yeah, it's still going dark.
1246000	1248000	Dark soccer. You said when you were at Disneyland,
1248000	1251000	you saw a lot of the Skylander stuff, right? I saw like a few things.
1251000	1253000	I thought that was interesting cause you know, it's weird.
1253000	1255000	But it might've been downtown Disney.
1255000	1259000	Oh, okay. You do see a little more bleed over in downtown Disney.
1259000	1261000	That makes sense.
1261000	1263000	But I think it's interesting.
1263000	1266000	I mean, it'll be cool at the same time though.
1266000	1268000	I really hate dealing with Skylanders.
1268000	1272000	It's more of a, it's going to be all these pieces.
1272000	1273000	It's an internal thing.
1273000	1276000	It's just that the toy industry does not line up well with the way things
1276000	1278000	are done in the game industry.
1278000	1279000	Unfortunately...
1279000	1281000	Hundreds of SKUs. Hundreds.
1281000	1283000	Well, it's not that. Everything's assorted.
1283000	1286000	So unfortunately, our system, the way it's set up,
1286000	1289000	there's no way to set up, hey, you're going to get random stuff in this box.
1289000	1293000	So you have to sell it by the case quantities that come in.
1293000	1296000	Thankfully the case is 6 or 12 for the characters,
1296000	1300000	but it's a receiving nightmare because the way they do it is
1300000	1302000	that case has a UPC on it.
1302000	1305000	That UPC you have to use for each individual character they order.
1305000	1309000	So if I order 12 of this UPC, we get in one box with that UPC.
1309000	1312000	So it looks like we're getting one twelfth of what we order.
1312000	1316000	I have to admit, if this game is, you know, as decent as Skylanders,
1316000	1318000	I kind of might be on board.
1318000	1322000	The Disney horror in me is kind of like, yes, please.
1322000	1325000	Although I'd rather have a new Kingdom Hearts, but okay.
1325000	1327000	Well, that's very nice.
1327000	1329000	You know they had Kingdom Hearts pins at the park.
1329000	1330000	I heard about this.
1330000	1331000	I got you one.
1331000	1334000	Suddenly Kingdom Hearts is being recognized by Disney again.
1334000	1335000	That's very exciting.
1335000	1337000	And actually they thought that it was like a Jedi one,
1337000	1340000	but when you pull up on the receipt, it says Kingdom Hearts Mickey.
1340000	1341000	Yay!
1341000	1344000	There's two other pins that I saw online, but they weren't in the park.
1344000	1346000	That would be awesome if they did like a LucasArts,
1346000	1348000	Kingdom Hearts type crossover,
1348000	1350000	like have one of the worlds be Star Wars World or something like that.
1350000	1351000	No, don't get your hopes up.
1351000	1352000	Muppets World.
1352000	1354000	Don't go crazy now.
1354000	1357000	Muppets World would happen before Star Wars, because Muppets is Disney now.
1357000	1358000	I understand that, yeah.
1358000	1359000	Yeah.
1359000	1361000	Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks
1361000	1363000	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1363000	1365000	Thank you for the update though, Loki.
1365000	1368000	I'm sure we're going to hear a lot more about it,
1368000	1370000	and there will probably be a big splash before E3,
1370000	1371000	because it's coming out.
1371000	1373000	Right now it's scheduled sometime in June,
1373000	1376000	because that's when I think these movies are coming out.
1376000	1380000	If I were to guess, I think there's going to be a redo of Cars,
1380000	1382000	kind of like how they did with Little Nemo 3D.
1382000	1383000	I think it's going to be Cars 3D.
1383000	1388000	I believe Pixar's next movie is the Monsters Inc prequel,
1388000	1389000	and I think it's out next year.
1389000	1391000	The website for that is Epic.
1391000	1392000	Is it?
1392000	1393000	That was the other thing.
1393000	1395000	I think they may have had some Monsters Inc characters too.
1395000	1396000	That would make sense.
1396000	1397000	I think that's next year.
1397000	1398000	It's called Monsters U.
1398000	1400000	Okay, Monsters U. Yeah, it's like a prequel.
1400000	1404000	The website that they have is done just like some college campus site.
1404000	1406000	It's actually really well done.
1406000	1407000	That's cool.
1407000	1408000	Yeah.
1408000	1409000	Okay, that makes sense.
1409000	1411000	All right, well, let's get into our gaming weeks
1411000	1413000	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week,
1413000	1415000	or Dark Soccer if you want to, for the past three weeks,
1415000	1416000	since it's been a little while since you've been here.
1416000	1417000	Stranger?
1417000	1420000	I played some Escaluda,
1420000	1425000	which I'm actually now in my head thinking of it as ESP Eagle.
1425000	1426000	Espagaluluda?
1426000	1429000	Because Garuda would be Eagle,
1429000	1431000	and I'm thinking it's Psychic Eagle.
1431000	1433000	So, Espagaluda.
1433000	1440000	And I played, of course, WoW, fucking pandas.
1440000	1442000	Is that what the expansion is called, fucking pandas?
1442000	1444000	Fucking pandas.
1444000	1447000	And I finally did heroics, by the way, which are pretty fun.
1447000	1450000	I did this new Show Lomance, by the way.
1450000	1452000	It's actually really well done.
1452000	1453000	I liked it.
1453000	1456000	So, played Mass Effect 3.
1456000	1458000	Well, I would play more Mass Effect 3
1458000	1461000	if it wasn't that the stupid EA servers won't connect,
1461000	1463000	and I've done every single...
1463000	1466000	I'm going to try Alan's suggestion and try to connect to my Mass Effect 2,
1466000	1470000	but I never had this problem until the patch.
1470000	1474000	So, it's clearly something having to do with the patch,
1474000	1476000	in my estimate.
1476000	1478000	I've bought DLC that I can't use
1478000	1481000	because I can't get into single player
1481000	1485000	because it won't let me play for my saved game.
1485000	1486000	Low origin.
1486000	1488000	Low origin.
1488000	1492000	More like fuck origin, you know?
1492000	1494000	And, uh...
1496000	1498000	Yeah, not much of anything else.
1498000	1501000	It's like, I'll sit and play something,
1501000	1504000	but I really have tried not to be at my house too much this past week, so...
1504000	1505000	Understandable.
1505000	1508000	Any playthroughs of stuff that you've watched, Dan?
1508000	1510000	Because you and Dan like to watch these playthroughs.
1510000	1512000	He's obsessed with Borderlands 2.
1512000	1514000	He's beaten it again.
1514000	1517000	It wasn't much harder this time, and...
1517000	1519000	Speaking of playthroughs,
1519000	1521000	I should give this a shout out.
1521000	1522000	This is an important shout out,
1522000	1525000	but shout out to everybody who participated with Extra Life this weekend.
1525000	1527000	Because, I mean, there were tons of playthroughs
1527000	1529000	all over the internet for a great cause this weekend.
1529000	1533000	So, I think most of those marathon fests so far,
1533000	1535000	they're probably winding down around now,
1535000	1537000	but props to all you guys who participated with that.
1537000	1538000	That's a great cause.
1538000	1541000	I really want us to do something like that at some point.
1541000	1545000	Even our buddy, Breslull, raised, what, 3 grand?
1545000	1546000	$3,300?
1546000	1547000	Yeah.
1547000	1548000	That's not a bad chunk of change.
1548000	1549000	Good for you, buddy.
1549000	1550000	Yeah.
1550000	1551000	Excellent.
1551000	1553000	All right, well, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1553000	1556000	I wish I had played more, but I didn't.
1556000	1559000	I played, let's see, lots of Minecraft.
1559000	1563000	I worked on a giant roller coaster the entire week,
1563000	1565000	and I pretty much finished it,
1565000	1568000	although Hitstone was working on some stuff,
1568000	1571000	so I don't know if they go check to see if it's still working again.
1571000	1574000	And then also a giant marquee with chasing lights.
1574000	1576000	I had those on there.
1578000	1582000	Let's see, also play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
1582000	1584000	I managed to pull off streak week.
1584000	1587000	That means I did not lose one single lunch game
1587000	1590000	that I played against my coworkers in Call of Duty
1590000	1592000	to their dismay, unfortunately.
1592000	1594000	So now I'm rubbing it in.
1594000	1596000	I was going to go for streak month.
1596000	1598000	However, I can't play on Monday
1598000	1601000	because I have to go look for costume stuff for Halloween.
1601000	1603000	What are you doing for Halloween?
1603000	1607000	Well, we'll see if we're going to be too lazy about it or not,
1607000	1611000	but we're going to do costumes for the yip-yips from Sesame Street.
1614000	1615000	Because it's fucking easy.
1615000	1618000	Yip, yip, yip, yip. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
1618000	1620000	Yip, yip, yip. Oh, my God, that's amazing.
1620000	1622000	You're not going as Sexy Burt.
1622000	1623000	Sexy Burt?
1623000	1625000	Oh, you haven't seen these costumes,
1625000	1627000	Sexy Burt and Sexy Ernie?
1627000	1628000	No.
1628000	1632000	There's some company online that does all these, like, sexy costumes.
1632000	1634000	They had Sexy Burt and Sexy Ernie.
1634000	1635000	Wow.
1635000	1636000	He's going to try and talk Alan into it,
1636000	1638000	but we don't have any Halloween plans.
1638000	1639000	We're at that age...
1639000	1642000	If they were going to really be sexy, they need to have assless chaps.
1642000	1645000	We're at that age where we turn off the lights at ten-thirty and go to bed.
1645000	1650000	Um, we'll see. I mean, once again, I don't know if I'm actually going to do it,
1650000	1652000	because the costume wouldn't be that hard.
1652000	1656000	It's basically just a piece of fabric, and you cut the mouth,
1656000	1660000	and you have to sew in this, like, sheer black stuff.
1660000	1664000	I don't remember what it was, but I used it in my Little Big Planet Zach Boy costume.
1664000	1668000	So I had to ask my mom what the fuck that was that we used.
1669000	1674000	Um, but then, so it's that, and then some, like, styrofoam balls for the eyes and pipe cleaners.
1674000	1679000	I mean, so it's really easy. It's just kind of doing the impression, I guess, would be...
1679000	1683000	Just saying, if you ever get hard up for ideas, the chatters would love to see the tingle thing happen.
1683000	1688000	Yeah, it's not going to happen, just because, once again, I mean, this is...
1688000	1690000	Listen, here's what we've got, okay?
1690000	1693000	Here's the three costume backup plan ideas that we have.
1693000	1694000	Not necessarily something that...
1694000	1697000	Obviously, it's not going to be something that we do this year.
1697000	1700000	There's Italian Spider-Man, because that's going to be hilarious.
1700000	1704000	How is Italian Spider-Man different from Spider-Man?
1704000	1706000	Have you not seen Italian Spider-Man?
1706000	1707000	No, is it, like, a YouTube thing or something?
1707000	1709000	Oh, you need to see Italian Spider-Man.
1709000	1710000	Okay, I haven't seen it.
1710000	1711000	Yes, Italian Spider-Man is fucking awesome.
1711000	1712000	Okay.
1712000	1713000	So there's that.
1713000	1715000	Actually, Danger 5 would be kind of...
1715000	1718000	Same people did Italian Spider-Man, Danger 5 stuff would be hilarious.
1718000	1722000	And giant cardboard robot.
1722000	1726000	Unfortunately, that one requires me to learn how to walk on stilts, and it's a little dangerous to do that.
1727000	1730000	You're not one to say no to a challenge.
1730000	1734000	I don't really want to buy painter's stilts, you know, so...
1734000	1736000	Probably not going to do that one.
1736000	1744000	But, I don't know. I think it would be funny to do the Yippie Yips if we can pull it off.
1744000	1746000	So, we may do that. We'll see.
1746000	1754000	Because I'm kind of... I'm not entirely broke right now, but, you know, it's like I could be doing other things right now.
1754000	1755000	So we'll see.
1755000	1757000	I love the chat room is trying. They're trying.
1757000	1767000	Black Wolf in our chat room says, let's say, just as a hypothetical, if I paid for Loki's airfare, accommodations, and Dragon Con badge, would he cosplay as Tingle at Dragon Con?
1767000	1768000	No.
1769000	1771000	But I would if you paid for all of that.
1771000	1772000	I know, I'm like, I would.
1772000	1775000	You failed to understand, though, that I can't travel, remember?
1775000	1777000	Oh yeah, that's right.
1777000	1779000	So that doesn't work.
1780000	1787000	There's now one of the difference about having the baby and having the kitty is that, you know, somebody can come watch the kitty and you can leave them on their own for so long.
1787000	1789000	Well, you can do that with a kid later on, but not right now.
1789000	1791000	That's true, that's true.
1792000	1794000	So, yeah, so there's that.
1794000	1798000	And then other stuff I played, I played a little bit more of Retro City Rampage.
1798000	1803000	I only like 30 minutes of it because I've been really just busy with Minecraft.
1803000	1807000	But I played a little bit of Retro City Rampage and that was fun.
1807000	1817000	I got to do a mission where my future self comes back in and a souped up DeLorean and we had to charge the DeLorean's engine or whatever by running over people.
1817000	1819000	So that was kind of fun.
1819000	1826000	And then also I did play a little bit of the Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale.
1826000	1830000	I just played one ranked match and did the tutorial.
1830000	1831000	It's alright.
1831000	1838000	The game for me is similar to Smash Brothers, but the problem with that game, I've been playing with four people that I don't know, it's just very chaotic.
1838000	1842000	I mean, I don't really know any of the characters' moves or anything.
1842000	1849000	The tutorial doesn't really, you know, it just basically tells you, okay, this button's a hit, this button's to throw people, go.
1849000	1851000	And you kind of have to figure it all out.
1851000	1854000	How long is that thing going for? Because I've yet to jump on board.
1854000	1855000	Ten more days.
1855000	1856000	Okay, so I've still got some time.
1856000	1858000	Yeah, so you've got time for that.
1858000	1860000	Maybe during break I'll go set the PS3 up to download that.
1860000	1863000	It's not on PS3. Well, yeah, PlayStation Plus, I guess. Yeah, you can do that.
1863000	1864000	Yeah, I have PS Plus.
1864000	1870000	So, and of course it's cross-play, so you can play against people that have the PS3 version and stuff.
1870000	1873000	What else did I do?
1873000	1876000	That was pretty much it.
1876000	1879000	I worked a little bit more on the whole DDR stuff.
1879000	1881000	I keep thinking about it.
1881000	1888000	I wanted what's going to cost so much to, you know, machine the stuff I need to.
1888000	1891000	So I'm almost like, maybe I should build a CIT and C machine.
1891000	1893000	So I may do that too. We'll see.
1893000	1896000	All right, my gaming week. I'll try to be quick because I know we're running long tonight.
1896000	1900000	But there's some new things I want to talk about.
1900000	1901000	First, let me get the old out of the way.
1901000	1906000	I've been playing more World of Warcraft, Mr. Pandaria, and while I overall do...
1906000	1908000	Fucking pandas.
1908000	1911000	And while overall I do love fucking pandas...
1911000	1916000	Oh, that sounded really bad, didn't it?
1916000	1919000	Let's rewind a little bit. Maybe I didn't really say that.
1919000	1926000	We dedicate this episode to Shermie, the episode of beastiality.
1926000	1930000	No, no, because that would insinuate necro beastiality.
1930000	1937000	Anyway, good lord, my gaming week.
1937000	1939000	Yes, I played Mr. Pandaria or whatever you want to call it.
1939000	1944000	And here's the thing, as much as I love the expansion, dailies are going to drive me fucking insane.
1944000	1945000	You're a bitch.
1945000	1947000	I'm done with dailies.
1947000	1950000	And if you want to get the best gear in the game, you've got to do the dailies.
1950000	1953000	And I'm so over it. That's all I want to say.
1953000	1955000	Mass Effect 3.
1955000	1959000	Despite Dark Soccer's issues, I'm actually able to play.
1959000	1963000	Even though it will take me like five minutes to connect, finally it will connect.
1963000	1967000	And on PC. I need to play more on Xbox 360. I really do.
1967000	1971000	I can't believe the days are here where it's easier to do it on Xbox Live than it is the PC.
1971000	1974000	But believe it.
1974000	1978000	I've been really enjoying this expansion content.
1978000	1982000	Even though the collectors are such assholes, every time they show up as the enemy, you're like,
1982000	1988000	Oh god, why? Oh god, Praetorians are such dicks.
1988000	1990000	Oh god, he's possessed.
1990000	1992000	But otherwise, Mass Effect 3 is great.
1992000	1994000	So let's talk about new stuff.
1994000	1998000	One game that I know y'all probably saw the review on vognetwork.com of,
1998000	2001000	and if you haven't seen it yet, you should go check out Vognetwork.
2001000	2009000	Because not only am I reviewing games, but we've got reviews up of TV shows and comic books and audio dramas.
2009000	2012000	Everything geek you can think of. It's there at vognetwork.com.
2012000	2015000	And there's plenty more coming throughout next week and so forth.
2015000	2018000	So make it a habit to check every day, okay?
2018000	2024000	But anyway, on vognetwork.com, I reviewed Dance Central 3, which Harmonix was kind enough to send us a copy of.
2024000	2026000	And I did enjoy it.
2026000	2028000	You know, I like Dance Central 1. I like Dance Central 2.
2028000	2032000	And I think by the time you get to a third game, you start to kind of feel like,
2032000	2036000	alright, what are they going to be able to pull off that's actually new that they didn't do in the past two games?
2036000	2039000	Believe it or not, Dance Central 3 did find some new things to do.
2039000	2043000	One of them is a very, very smart party mode.
2043000	2048000	And, you know, when you boot the game, do you want to go to the main menu or do you want to just start the party?
2048000	2052000	And when I'm talking party mode, I'm talking pretty good mix of multiplayer things.
2052000	2056000	You know, the two people dancing at the same time that you're used to.
2056000	2061000	This whole dance battle tournament style thing where, you know, the crew battle,
2061000	2064000	where you can set it up with like eight people, I think, can all do this.
2064000	2068000	Or just jump in, jump out, high five, play.
2068000	2070000	It's really smart the way they did it.
2070000	2072000	And I think it's going to get even better.
2072000	2077000	It's unfortunate I couldn't see the game's full, full potential right now because Smart Glass,
2077000	2080000	it's supposed to be one of the first games that's going to support the Smart Glass,
2080000	2084000	where while people are dancing on the couch, maybe you're not the type that wants to get up and dance.
2084000	2088000	Well, you can sit there on the couch and control what songs are coming up next through Smart Glass.
2088000	2090000	So I think that's a pretty neat use of it.
2090000	2096000	You know, it's using the technology wisely without whoring it, and I think that's a smart way to do it.
2096000	2103000	So, yeah, there's a lot of good stuff in Dance Central 3, especially when it comes to multiplayer.
2103000	2107000	Oh, the mimic. You can do a dance move and then your partner has to like mimic it too.
2107000	2108000	That's kind of neat.
2109000	2114000	Solo stuff. When it comes to the solo stuff, it's kind of what you know already.
2114000	2116000	I mean, there's only so much one person can do.
2116000	2121000	However, there is a comprehensive new story mode in the game.
2121000	2123000	I thought it was a little silly.
2123000	2126000	Some people will enjoy its over-the-topness.
2126000	2130000	I was a little bit like, all right, why am I playing this mode again?
2130000	2134000	Because I'd rather would just like choose the songs I want to do and dance to it.
2134000	2136000	And to give the game credit, I can do that.
2136000	2138000	I can just go into the dance mode to do it.
2138000	2145000	But I did kind of sit there going, oh, this mode is actually put together really nicely.
2145000	2147000	It's kind of a shame it's so silly.
2147000	2153000	But, you know, I liked the concept that you were traveling through the decades
2153000	2156000	because it really gave it a comprehensive song list.
2156000	2165000	But to give you an idea how silly it was, you find yourself in Dance Central Intelligence, DCI,
2165000	2169000	and they send you back in time to find the dance moves of the evil guy.
2169000	2171000	It's silly.
2171000	2177000	But it was a good excuse to put things like YMCA, you know, and some of the 70s classics are there.
2177000	2178000	I actually thought the 70s-
2178000	2179000	Do we get the hustle?
2179000	2180000	Yes, the hustle is in the game.
2180000	2181000	Oh my God, I have to play it.
2181000	2182000	Do you know what song is in the game?
2182000	2185000	You Will Lose Your Shit to represent the 80s.
2185000	2186000	What?
2186000	2187000	Let the music play.
2187000	2189000	That's like my favorite 80s song ever.
2189000	2190000	I know.
2190000	2193000	When I saw that in there, I was like, oh, Dark Soccer is going to flip her shit.
2193000	2194000	But then there's like, okay-
2194000	2196000	Consider my shit flipped.
2196000	2200000	Then some of the 90s stuff, I was like, all right, we need to stop.
2200000	2202000	We need to stop.
2202000	2204000	Ice Ice Baby.
2204000	2206000	You know, he's 45 now.
2206000	2207000	Vanilla Ice is 45.
2207000	2210000	Hangin' Tough, or one of the new Kids on the Block songs is in there.
2210000	2212000	This is silly, silly shit.
2212000	2213000	Really?
2213000	2217000	Okay, so as much as you can look at that and laugh and whatever, when you get into the modern stuff,
2217000	2221000	I was not a big, big fan of the modern stuff they picked.
2222000	2224000	Here's the problem.
2224000	2229000	Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2 had such good song lists when it came to contemporary stuff,
2229000	2231000	there was really slim pickings for 3.
2231000	2235000	I mean, some of the newer- like, they have moves like Jagger and the J-Lo song,
2235000	2237000	and you know, some of them are represented,
2237000	2243000	but it didn't feel as modern club as Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2.
2243000	2247000	But the good news, of course, if you own the prior games, you import the song list for 400 Microsoft points.
2247000	2250000	You don't have to pay it again for number 1 if you already imported 1 into 2,
2250000	2251000	which is great.
2251000	2253000	So, um, yeah.
2253000	2256000	I, you know, overall, I ended up giving the game a B-plus on VOG Network.
2256000	2260000	The strengths, of course, were the party mode, the instant stuff.
2260000	2265000	The fact that I felt like there were more things to do in Part 3 from Part 2
2265000	2268000	than there were from Part 1 to Part 2.
2268000	2269000	Mm-hmm.
2269000	2270000	What?
2270000	2272000	Was there gay dancing mode?
2272000	2274000	Funny you should bring that up.
2274000	2279000	You know, if you play Dance Central 2, a lot of the dances are very, shall we say, feminine.
2279000	2282000	Dance Central 3, I wasn't feeling that.
2282000	2284000	And maybe a big part of that has to do with the song list.
2284000	2287000	Although there was one song. What was it?
2287000	2293000	Oh, um, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.
2293000	2295000	Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.
2295000	2296000	Hello.
2296000	2297000	Hello.
2297000	2298000	Uh uh uh oh.
2298000	2299000	You know that song?
2299000	2302000	Like, you have to do, like, these little, like, moves called, like, seduce and things
2302000	2304000	where you're basically, like, smacking your ass and all this stuff.
2304000	2307000	That was, that was still a little, a little bit gay dancing.
2307000	2309000	But, you know, I liked it a little bit.
2309000	2314000	And plus, nothing is more hilarious, I'm sorry, I don't care who you are,
2314000	2316000	we're gonna have some real talk right now about Dance Central.
2316000	2321000	Nothing is more hilarious than when you get to that freestyle section of the song
2321000	2324000	where it takes 16 pictures of you or whatever really fast
2324000	2327000	to run up to the camera and start booty poppin'
2327000	2330000	and then turn around just in time to see your butt back on the screen.
2330000	2331000	Come on.
2331000	2332000	You know you've all tried it.
2332000	2334000	No, I have not tried it.
2334000	2335000	You need to try it. It's fun.
2335000	2340000	I still think, though, that nothing is as wonderful as watching you play, um, the ABBA.
2340000	2343000	Oh, the, the, uh, yeah, that's, that's the sad thing,
2343000	2346000	is that the 70s, unfortunately, did not have ABBA to represent them.
2346000	2349000	But I always thought Sony had the lock on ABBA because of SingStar,
2349000	2352000	but then Ubisoft had that You Can Dance game, so I don't know, I guess.
2352000	2353000	I'm not gonna hold my breath.
2353000	2355000	I'm not gonna hold my breath for Dance Central to get the rights to it.
2355000	2357000	It's, it's alright. It's alright.
2357000	2359000	So, uh, there you go.
2359000	2363000	AcidicVampire in chat says, yes, but can I bend and snap?
2363000	2367000	You can do whatever you want in freestyle mode.
2367000	2370000	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I've never tried that.
2370000	2372000	I've also never fucked pandas like Rob has.
2372000	2376000	Hey, hey, shut up.
2376000	2378000	Alright, what else new can I talk about?
2378000	2382000	Oh, um, I went into GameStop this week.
2382000	2383000	I know, I know.
2383000	2386000	I just, I was there and I had this impulse.
2386000	2392000	Like, I, I, I had to have LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation Vita right now.
2392000	2395000	Like, I wasn't gonna wait for Amazon. I had to go get it right now.
2395000	2398000	I understand that, so why didn't you just buy it digitally?
2398000	2399000	You know what?
2399000	2401000	Because, because I want, I don't, I don't like it.
2401000	2404000	That worked out for me getting Mass Effect 3 because I was impatient
2404000	2408000	and I actually got him to go down to the Amazon price.
2408000	2411000	But anyway, I, I ended up buying it.
2411000	2415000	But not only did I, um, go into GameStop to buy that game,
2415000	2417000	but they had a Wii U demo unit up and running.
2417000	2420000	So, uh, check that, I think these things are starting to show up
2420000	2423000	at your Best Buys and GameStops and where have you.
2423000	2425000	Uh, so if you want to get your hands on the Wii U, you can do that.
2425000	2427000	Uh, I was surprised, I'll say this much.
2427000	2429000	I don't want to get into the whole Wii U debate thing again
2429000	2431000	because we're already running long, but I will say this much.
2431000	2435000	I was surprised those tablets were a lot bigger than I was giving it credit for.
2435000	2438000	Because in my mind, I'm thinking, oh, that thing is kind of like
2438000	2440000	the bottom part of a, a 3DS or whatever.
2440000	2443000	So I was thinking it was gonna be, like, I didn't think it would be that small,
2443000	2445000	but I didn't think it would be that big either.
2445000	2449000	So I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the Wii U pad.
2449000	2453000	Otherwise, there wasn't a lot on the demo unit to really get a feel for the system.
2453000	2456000	The only thing you could play was the Rayman's, uh, game.
2456000	2458000	And I watched Alan play it, I didn't really want to play it.
2458000	2463000	He played some mode that really reminded me of Bit.Trip Runner,
2463000	2465000	which I don't remember that being in Rayman, but alright,
2465000	2467000	I guess it's one of the mini-games or whatever,
2467000	2471000	is there's like a mode like Bit.Trip Runner where you're kind of hitting buttons in tune to the music.
2471000	2473000	So, there you go.
2473000	2480000	So, hmm, um, what was I gonna say, uh, so was the controller comfortable? I mean...
2480000	2484000	Yeah, I thought it was, it was fine. I didn't, I didn't really hold it for very long
2484000	2488000	because Alan did the playing of the demo, but I thought, I thought it was fine.
2488000	2491000	It's, it's, it's like bigger than a PlayStation Vita.
2491000	2493000	I mean, it's, you do have to kind of get used to it.
2493000	2496000	It's like holding this small little laptop in your hands.
2496000	2498000	It's almost, it's almost bigger than this.
2498000	2500000	This, uh, it's slightly bigger than this.
2500000	2502000	And I'm pointing at this, um, laptop thing.
2502000	2503000	The Dell Mini 10.
2503000	2504000	Dark Soccer's using what?
2504000	2505000	The Dell Mini 10.
2505000	2506000	Yeah.
2506000	2507000	So, anyway.
2507000	2514000	I apparently just got an answer from EA about my stupid Mass Effect thing, so I'm going to check it.
2514000	2516000	Oh, are you gonna try playing Mass Effect right now during the show?
2516000	2517000	No, I can't play on the netbook.
2517000	2518000	I was gonna say.
2518000	2520000	That'll make that thing implode if you try to do that.
2520000	2521000	Alright.
2521000	2524000	It won't make it implode. It'll just melt into a puddle of for fuck's sake.
2524000	2528000	Uh, Nate4322 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, would you buy it?
2528000	2529000	I'm thinking about getting one.
2529000	2532000	Um, I'm probably gonna get one because I'm a consumer whore.
2532000	2534000	I didn't pre-order one, though.
2534000	2535000	And hell.
2535000	2543000	I didn't, so unless I can get the hookup, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, uh, through friends, I'm, I may not, I may be shit out of luck.
2543000	2544000	You can do what I did.
2544000	2545000	What?
2545000	2546000	Wait in line outside Target.
2546000	2547000	All night.
2547000	2548000	I don't, oh yeah, Target didn't do pre-orders, did they?
2548000	2550000	We bribed, we bribed our way into the line.
2550000	2551000	Yeah.
2551000	2557000	Um, I was gonna say that, uh, well, Rayman Legends is your type of game.
2557000	2560000	You're not getting it at launch.
2560000	2563000	It's coming out in March now.
2563000	2564000	Alright.
2564000	2566000	Um, hey, that's launch window.
2566000	2574000	Cause, you know, launch window is like this, you know, if Nintendo has windows that large, I mean, shit, I'm surprised they haven't gotten broken into.
2574000	2575000	Alright, you.
2575000	2577000	We're not debating the Wii U tonight.
2577000	2580000	Um, I will talk about, though, LittleBigPlanet Vita briefly.
2580000	2585000	I haven't been able to spend a whole lot of time with it, but I will say I'm pleasantly surprised with it so far.
2585000	2589000	It really does feel like I'm playing LittleBigPlanet 2 on the go.
2589000	2590000	The game looks really nice.
2590000	2598000	And the new touch mechanic, pretty cool, where, um, basically the new big thing you can do is that certain blocks will be a very bright color.
2598000	2599000	It's very prominent.
2599000	2600000	You can't miss it.
2600000	2603000	And you can actually pick those blocks up with your finger and move them around.
2604000	2607000	And you can use them to, uh, you know, move Sackboy and so forth.
2607000	2611000	But they also, you know, you can use it like little plungers to make Sackboy like a pinball.
2611000	2613000	You know, you can kind of do different things with it.
2613000	2615000	And I thought this was really cool, some of the mini games.
2615000	2621000	Like, you'll launch a mini game and the little icon comes up that says, turn your PS Vita sideways.
2621000	2625000	So you turn the PlayStation Vita sideways and the whole level is played vertically.
2625000	2628000	Like, the first one you get is like a whack-a-mole thing that you use with your finger.
2628000	2633000	So, you know, LittleBigPlanet in so far, it's, uh, it's impressing me.
2633000	2636000	Um, I haven't had enough, again, to give my full impressions.
2636000	2643000	But the one other thing I'll say about it that I actually liked compared to LittleBigPlanet 2 is that it did not default to,
2643000	2646000	let's go online and play with strangers, yay!
2646000	2649000	Like, no, it defaults to play by yourself.
2649000	2651000	And if you want to do that, you can.
2651000	2655000	But you don't, like, it's not being shoved down your throat to do that.
2655000	2657000	So I'm, I'm, uh, I was very happy about that.
2657000	2661000	And that already has me liking it almost a little more than LittleBigPlanet 2.
2661000	2663000	Although I do love LittleBigPlanet 2.
2663000	2668000	Alright, we're going to get into gaming news already, but first, some quick housekeeping.
2668000	2678000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R and, uh, of course, Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to be our friend on various social networks.
2678000	2680000	Um, I think that's really it.
2680000	2683000	There's no, the award nomination stuff is all over now.
2683000	2686000	We're just waiting to hear if enough of you nominated.
2686000	2690000	And we'll find out, I think Stitcher's stuff goes up tomorrow, so we'll see.
2690000	2691000	We'll let you know on the next show.
2691000	2695000	But meanwhile, we're going to deliver some gaming news and talk about it a little bit.
2695000	2697000	So, Loki, as always, start us off.
2697000	2700000	So, let's talk about another company laying off people.
2700000	2701000	It's, uh, Sony this time around.
2701000	2704000	They're cutting 2,000 jobs out of their head office.
2704000	2709000	And, um, they're expecting about 20% of the employees leaving by the end of the year.
2709000	2713000	The way they're doing this is they're giving them early retirements, I guess.
2713000	2720000	And, um, also I guess they, uh, had already laid off 10,000 people earlier this year.
2720000	2726000	And, uh, I guess just trying to, you know, make up some of the lost money that they've had.
2726000	2731000	Because, uh, they're trying to, I guess, save $378 million annually.
2733000	2736000	I mean, that's kind of the trend nowadays.
2736000	2739000	Like, got to do more with less, I guess.
2739000	2745000	And, you know, sometimes maybe they just have too much overlap with some of those positions.
2745000	2747000	You know, funny enough, somebody asked me earlier.
2747000	2751000	We were playing that clip about, uh, the tester and all that earlier in the show.
2751000	2754000	Somebody asked me, do you know if there's going to be a tester for the answer?
2754000	2756000	Yes, I actually can answer that for you.
2756000	2758000	The answer is no, there's not going to be a tester for.
2758000	2761000	And the reason why, it actually has nothing to do with the quality of the show or whatever,
2761000	2763000	or whatever easy joke you want to make.
2763000	2768000	Remember when all those layoffs happened at Santa Monica Studio that majorly hit the PR department in that area?
2769000	2771000	The people who did the tester were let go.
2771000	2773000	That's surrounding out there on the internet.
2773000	2776000	Wasn't that also core as well, then they get rid of core?
2776000	2777000	I believe so.
2777000	2782000	So, there will not be a tester for unless they decide to rehire for it at a later time.
2782000	2787000	And go fig, that core wasn't a very good, um, way to get people to sign up for PlayStation Plus.
2787000	2788000	Unfortunate.
2788000	2792000	Yeah, well, what you gonna do?
2793000	2796000	Um, so yeah, that kind of sucks.
2796000	2806000	Also, they're saying that they are going to be letting go 840 employees as part of their lens factory in Minokamo.
2808000	2814000	Because, you know, they do make blu-ray players and CD players and DVD players, so.
2814000	2816000	And cameras.
2816000	2818000	Lots of lenses.
2819000	2830000	Well, do you think this has to, is this the usual ebb and flow of what we see happening at game companies where projects end and people get let go?
2830000	2838000	Or do you want to go so far as to make the argument that the PlayStation 3's performance or lack thereof is to blame for this?
2838000	2844000	I think it's neither of that. I think all it is is just that they're maybe suffering losses in other areas.
2844000	2850000	Like perhaps, you know, TV's aren't maybe doing as well. You know, the Sony phones maybe not selling as well.
2850000	2856000	Or they just need to cut costs because they're not making as much as they were before.
2856000	2864000	And so now they're going to just lay people off. I mean, that kind of happens in all industries where they'll just kind of try to streamline things a little bit more.
2864000	2873000	Maybe they just don't have work for these people. Or, you know, they decided, hey, we don't need a reality show that kind of is alright, I guess.
2873000	2883000	And it's costing us a lot of money to put this out. And really, we're not seeing much of a return on, you know, people signing up for PlayStation Plus.
2883000	2888000	Although I don't think that was exclusive to PlayStation Plus. But we don't have people coming to our network because of the tester.
2888000	2893000	So let's just cut some costs there and we'll just give people free games instead for PlayStation Plus.
2893000	2899000	Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, do you think the people who won on the tester also got laid off? Can Sony lay off game testers? Well, yes, they can.
2899000	2906000	And actually, go back and listen to the show that had Asuka was on the show, you know, when that was new.
2906000	2915000	It ended up being the week before she was kicked off. But she said that they would get everybody hyped up about the prize and then the cameras would cut.
2915000	2921000	Just so you guys know, it's a six month contract. So technically, Sony was never under any obligation to hire those people.
2922000	2929000	Didn't we talk about it like a couple weeks ago? There was the guy that, I think it was the first guy that won. He came out like smashing, like totally dissing Sony on a bunch of stuff.
2929000	2936000	Like talking about how they've made mistakes, you know, left and right with their properties. Did they? I don't know. I don't think we talked about that here.
2936000	2948000	Yeah, I remember reading that. Well, I can say the second guy who won, the gamer, he used his position to end up moving up to Sony Pictures.
2948000	2959000	He works for Sony Entertainment now, so he wouldn't have been affected by this. The first guy, he got into PR, so he might've, I mean, I don't know, I can't speak for the guy.
2959000	2967000	And the other thing to consider too is all these layoffs are in Japan. There's nothing in the US. But we did have the PR layoffs that happened just not that long ago.
2967000	2974000	I don't know what would have happened with the third guy that won because he was a very recent winner, but most of these guys, and he was an associate producer, right?
2974000	2977000	Yeah, he was probably under contract somewhere or something.
2977000	2984000	And as ShadowNextGen in chat says, any company can lay off anyone. That's absolutely right. So who knows? Who knows?
2984000	2985000	Been there, done that.
2985000	2995000	Yep. All right, let's move on with more news. Good luck to those that were impacted by this. This is never any fun to report on.
2995000	3011000	But hey, I'll use this as an opportunity to plug Bobby's show from tonight. He had a great interview tonight with a game recruiter who was very motivational about how to, you know, kind of be resilient about what happens when you get laid off and kind of what not to do.
3011000	3018000	And I found that very interesting because he was very honest. So I'm not going to give it all away though. You have to go check that out, BobbyBlackWolf.
3018000	3025000	Show which will be posted to vognetwork.com at some point this week or look him up on Stitcher as well, BobbyBlackWolf.
3025000	3040000	Let's talk about Zynga real quick. So Zynga is having a very interesting year. They're stock, they're games, and now people seem to be abandoning ship left and right.
3040000	3050000	And one of these people that's left is getting sued. And it's the former Cityville general manager. I didn't even realize there was a game called Cityville, but I guess that makes sense.
3050000	3067000	The guy's name is Alan Patmore. And in this lawsuit, Zynga believes that Alan Patmore uploaded company assets to a Dropbox account from his company computer, both on the day before and day of his departure from the company.
3067000	3080000	Well that's a no-no. That would be information on Zynga's game mechanics, Cityville's performance assessments, monetization plans, emails, design documents, including an unreleased game design document.
3080000	3095000	So Mr. Patmore went to a social game company called KixEye and Zynga is alleging, again we can't say he did it, we don't know, but Zynga is alleging in these documents that he is going to use this information to directly compete with Zynga.
3096000	3109000	A quote from the lawsuit could be used to improve a competitor's internal understanding and know-how of core game mechanics and monetization techniques, its execution, and ultimately its market standing to compete more effectively with Zynga.
3109000	3118000	Patmore apparently refused to sign a termination certification. They're saying this reaffirmed all of this information.
3118000	3124000	They're trying to block Patmore and his company from accessing the data and they want it back.
3124000	3136000	KixEye, in an interview with All Things Digital, said they have nothing to do with the suit, but apparently they slipped this thing in at Zynga.
3136000	3145000	Unfortunately, this appears to be Zynga's new employee retention strategy, suing former employees to scare current employees into staying.
3148000	3154000	Thoughts? I mean, we don't know if the guy really did it or not.
3154000	3161000	I mean, if it's true, big if, capital I, capital F, if it's true, that's obviously a huge no-no.
3161000	3167000	You don't upload shit to your personal account. I mean, that's just setting yourself up for disaster, no matter what it is.
3167000	3175000	It's one thing to take, you know, company typefaces that were designed for the company. Another thing to take game mechanics.
3175000	3180000	Yeah, it's kind of different. It's kind of, well, it's still not appropriate.
3180000	3183000	I can't help it if they had pretty font, okay?
3184000	3191000	But still, I mean, let's say that if you did design work at the company, what's appropriate for you to take with you and master files?
3191000	3194000	Technically, you did it on the company clock, so they belong to the company.
3194000	3200000	That's true. But there is, you can keep your own work for the sake of your portfolio.
3200000	3205000	I was just about to say, now, surely you can have like a PDF for your portfolio or whatever, but you don't get to keep.
3205000	3211000	If it's stuff this guy designed, then he's entitled to retain a copy for himself. He just can't use it elsewhere.
3211000	3218000	Yeah, but if we're talking about information on Zynga's game mechanics, assessments of the performance, that's not one person.
3218000	3224000	So what you're saying is he had a copy of Tiny Towers on his computer that he uploaded to the Dropbox, right?
3228000	3235000	So, yeah, I don't know. Zynga, we're going to get into this a little later when we get to the Google question of the week,
3235000	3243000	but I'm very interested to see where Zynga ends up in a few years because it really seems like that company is, it's abandoned ship fast over there.
3243000	3249000	I don't know. So I kind of point and laugh at them every time I'm in San Francisco.
3249000	3254000	I have a cry because I always go, that was the Sega building that used to be like Dreamcast headquarters.
3254000	3259000	And now it's Farmville 2 headquarters. I know, seriously. Fuck a whole lot of Farmville 2.
3259000	3264000	I keep getting invites for that on Facebook. I have tried to block it and I'm still getting it.
3264000	3268000	While I'm at it, fuck Facebook. Do you know I couldn't use the Facebook?
3268000	3272000	You know how like Facebook has a separate camera application? It would not let me use it.
3272000	3276000	It says location services are required to use this application.
3276000	3280000	I said fuck you and deleted it. I'll just use Instagram where it's optional.
3280000	3288000	And like every time, I'm going to get on a separate here, but I turn location stuff off on Facebook and I've talked about this before.
3288000	3291000	If I want to advertise where I am, I'll use Foursquare.
3291000	3296000	Otherwise, I don't see the need to always post every place I'm at, including my home address.
3296000	3301000	So turn it off. But it just keeps magically coming back on on Facebook.
3301000	3303000	I'm about ready to go back to Google+.
3303000	3308000	I'm about ready to just delete Facebook, but I've threatened that about four times on this show and I haven't done it yet.
3308000	3311000	So I need to put my money where my mouth is, I guess.
3311000	3314000	On top of that, Facebook has turned into Attention Horse Central.
3314000	3317000	Pay attention to me. Pay attention to me.
3318000	3321000	Well, Facebook does exist on the Internet, so we'll see.
3321000	3324000	Let's pay attention to your story, Dark Soccer. What do you have for us?
3324000	3327000	This is awesome because it's Sega. Sega.
3327000	3333000	I'm sure you've all heard of the Model 2 arcade board, right? There's some great games on it.
3333000	3336000	Virtua Fighter. Well, I won't say Virtua Fighter was great because I'm a Virtua Fighter.
3336000	3338000	I thought you said great games.
3338000	3341000	Yeah. Well, there's a lot of people who are fans of Virtua Fighter 2.
3341000	3344000	I only played that game to try to knock Kage's mask off.
3344000	3347000	Sonic Fighters. Sonic the Fighters was great.
3347000	3350000	And one of my favorite ever games, Virtual On.
3350000	3360000	Well, there's going to be an Xbox Live arcade and a PlayStation Network, which is a release game that's a Model 2 collection.
3360000	3365000	Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers, Cyber Trooper Virtual On, Virtua Striker, and Sonic the Fighters.
3365000	3371000	I'll tell you what my experience with Sonic the Fighters is, is Fighters Megamix.
3371000	3376000	You could also play as the car from Daytona and beat people up with a car.
3376000	3379000	Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
3379000	3381000	Which I believe is another Model 2 game, right?
3381000	3383000	Yes. No, it was Home Only.
3383000	3385000	That already came out anyway.
3385000	3388000	Daytona was Model 2.
3388000	3390000	I was thinking of Fighters Megamix.
3390000	3392000	I understand. Yes, it's already come out.
3392000	3395000	I understand. It's still another excuse to play the song.
3395000	3402000	Anyway, it's going to be, for Japan pricing anyways, 800 Microsoft points, or 10 bucks.
3402000	3406000	I'm sure we're going to get it, so yay.
3406000	3408000	We need a Fighters Megamix 2.
3408000	3411000	Fighters Megamix was so much fun.
3411000	3414000	It's just the fun thing about playing as a car.
3414000	3420000	I'm a car. Punch. Sonic versus car.
3420000	3421000	That was great.
3421000	3422000	Good times.
3422000	3424000	Okay.
3424000	3430000	I was just thinking. I saw a Robot Chicken clip this week of Street Fighter.
3430000	3441000	It was basically Ryu telling people what to do as far as scheduling all their fights and stuff.
3441000	3444000	One of the fights was Ken.
3444000	3446000	I thought I was supposed to be fighting E. Honda.
3446000	3449000	No, I'm sorry. That says you're fighting A. Honda.
3449000	3452000	This is stupid. Why would I want to fight a car?
3452000	3455000	Just punch the car. Okay. He starts punching the car.
3455000	3458000	Hey, this is actually kind of cool.
3458000	3460000	So it was like the bonus round?
3460000	3461000	Yeah, it was the bonus round.
3461000	3462000	That's pretty cool.
3462000	3463000	That was great.
3463000	3469000	Anyways, let's talk a little bit about some cool stuff.
3469000	3478000	We always talk about holodeck gaming as kind of the, you know, oh my god.
3478000	3482000	Everything we've ever done in gaming has been taking us one step closer to the holodeck.
3482000	3490000	Remember when we were kids and we all saw Mode 7 for the first time, like pilot wings and stuff?
3490000	3494000	And it's like, oh my god. This blows my fucking mind.
3494000	3496000	Dracula X on Super Nintendo.
3496000	3498000	The fire's moving.
3498000	3503000	Oh my god. It's like real parallax scrolling.
3504000	3508000	Everything since then has been taking us one step closer to the holodeck.
3508000	3510000	Yeah, and we're not the only ones to think that.
3510000	3515000	Of course, also Gearbox Software President Randy Pitchford kind of saying the same thing.
3515000	3519000	Imagine the spectrum of what's possible in the computing world.
3519000	3525000	And, you know, basically look at how fast everything is progressing.
3525000	3527000	You know, how the engines are getting bigger and bigger.
3527000	3533000	It says the real exciting thing is about the people, the relationships and the business involved and how they're working together.
3533000	3538000	You know, obviously there's going to be, you know, better simulations, better.
3538000	3545000	I mean, if you think about it, look at how far things have gone in just the last like 20 years, 30 years.
3545000	3547000	I mean, it's just been like, holy crap.
3547000	3551000	Well, yeah, I mean, Super Nintendo was 1990 when that came out.
3551000	3554000	So like 92 would have been right at the height of like Super Nintendo.
3554000	3556000	Yeah, I mean, we're 20 years since then.
3556000	3560000	20 years. Can you imagine what 20 years from now is going to be? It's like, fuck yeah.
3560000	3562000	Or what is the Ultra HD?
3562000	3566000	We're just going to have a chip in our brain. So we close our eyes and we're playing Mass Effect.
3566000	3570000	Well, now there's, you'll get to make out with Garris for real.
3570000	3574000	There's Ultra HD now is that new thing, right?
3574000	3577000	Because I was reading on the internet this week, that's the now approved 4K.
3577000	3580000	4K is now Ultra HD or whatever. So that's what we have to look forward to.
3580000	3582000	And, you know, 3D is already a thing.
3582000	3586000	I'm sure it's just a matter of time before you have an environment where you can have TVs on three walls,
3586000	3590000	so you can like look all around you and see things in 3D. I mean, that's where we're going to be at in 20 years.
3590000	3596000	That would basically be the Microsoft thing that they have with their projectors and stuff, what we were talking about before.
3596000	3601000	They actually are doing holographic television. I was watching a special on it just like a month ago.
3601000	3605000	And you want to know what kind of creeps me out? Like now that I have an iPhone 5,
3605000	3608000	you know what kind of creeps me out a little bit? Siri.
3609000	3614000	Like for real. Like, Siri kind of creeps me out a little bit because like I can tell it.
3615000	3617000	Open the pod bay doors.
3620000	3622000	Yeah, she's a little slow though.
3622000	3625000	That's a rather insensitive thing to say to an intelligent agent.
3626000	3630000	See, but like she does shit like that. Like the other day, or no, no, this is earlier.
3630000	3634000	Like just earlier today, I hit the little button. I said, Siri, wake me up in 30 minutes.
3634000	3637000	And she goes, okay, I set the alarm for, you know, 440 or whatever it was.
3638000	3643000	And then I just out of habit, I went, thank you. That's it. And she goes, I live to serve.
3644000	3649000	And I'm like, I just talked to my iPhone. Really? You live to serve. Are you programmed?
3649000	3653000	Have you ever told Siri good night? No, I never had. Good night to you too.
3654000	3660000	See, like we're getting into like, like we're getting a little closer to this Cylon thing that has me a little bit worried.
3661000	3666000	I mean, artificial intelligence has really taken off in 20 years too. That's all I'm saying.
3667000	3671000	Like, can you imagine that type of interaction, like in a mass effect type of game? It's just, it's crazy.
3672000	3673000	How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
3674000	3675000	No one cares.
3676000	3677000	Hush.
3678000	3680000	Just because it could, doesn't mean that it would.
3684000	3688000	Why can't it just say stop fucking wasting my time with stupid inane questions?
3690000	3697000	Doesn't she get offended if you go like, fuck you or whatever. Doesn't she say, you are entitled to your opinion, or this is about you, not about me.
3698000	3702000	That one's my favorite. What if you go, you can also though, ask her how to make meth and it'll pull up the chemical formula.
3703000	3709000	What if you, what if you, um, you go up to her and you go, Hey, how you doing? You know, like friends.
3711000	3712000	How you doing?
3713000	3714000	I'm testing it out.
3717000	3718000	Siri's thinking about it.
3720000	3721000	Beep beep.
3722000	3723000	Okay.
3724000	3725000	Let me try one here.
3726000	3728000	Where could I score some marijuana?
3734000	3735000	Schedule?
3736000	3738000	Yes. I'm sorry. You can't take the train to marijuana town.
3739000	3740000	I like though. I like this one.
3741000	3743000	Where can I hide a body?
3750000	3757000	Martuaries, swamps, metal foundries, cremation services, reservoirs, mines, or dumps.
3759000	3760000	Metal foundries.
3761000	3762000	What is this Terminator?
3763000	3764000	All right, turn that bitch off. I'm sorry.
3765000	3767000	Where, where were we? Holodeck.
3768000	3769000	How can I stop Skynet?
3771000	3775000	Anyways, so holiday gaming, of course it's always going to be what it's going to be.
3775000	3787000	You know, the goal. And I think that, you know, as we get, it seems to be the whole kind of 3D's coming back, the whole VR stuff's almost coming back a little bit with that, um, you know, Oculus Rift stuff.
3788000	3792000	And, you know, of course more of the, you know, haptic technologies are kind of taking off.
3793000	3801000	I'm sure in, I'm sure in 10 years time we'll have, you know, some pretty interesting, uh, interactions with the computers. It's going to become more seamless.
3802000	3810000	You know, it's, it's just like, you know, if you think about it now, you know, like 30 years ago, someone told you, yeah, you're going to be carrying around computers with you.
3811000	3820000	You know, like everybody's like had that whole futuristic fantasy of like a wristwatch computer thing, but look at, look at that, you've got like a HD screen in your, the palm of your hand.
3821000	3823000	It's basically better than what you wanted.
3823000	3836000	You know, 20 years ago you had a 40 megabyte drive in your computer and that was like Uber storage for everything. Now you can store what, like almost a thousand times that in the, in a little tiny chip in your hand. It's crazy.
3837000	3840000	So it's, it's going to be interesting.
3841000	3845000	Well, I'm glad that our game developers are already thinking about the holodeck. That's, I think that's a good sign.
3846000	3851000	Too bad it doesn't matter because the world's going to end this, no, just kidding. No one believes that, except for crazy people.
3851000	3867000	All right. Well, one thing that the holodeck may not have in it is Facebook and Twitter. That's because Microsoft is doing away with it. In their fall 2012 update, Twitter and Facebook are going to be gone from the dashboard.
3868000	3878000	These apps are officially being retired. In an interview with IGN, Microsoft said they are quote retiring the Facebook and Twitter apps. No comment on if they're ever going to come back.
3878000	3888000	Assumptions are, well, now you have Internet Explorer 9 that's built in. So if you really want to do Facebook and Twitter, you can go on to Internet Explorer and do it that way.
3889000	3901000	All right. Let's be real though. Everybody's talking about this on the internet. Everybody's mentioning this. I bet if they had just deleted them, a lot of you would have never known because seriously, when was the last time you used Twitter on your Xbox?
3902000	3913000	I'll tell you when you used Twitter on your Xbox. You loaded it up the first day it came out and wrote a tweet that said, hi from my Xbox 360, lol butts goodbye. And that was probably the last time you did it.
3914000	3924000	So instead of, you know, making Twitter and Facebook so terribly difficult to use in the Xbox 360, why couldn't they have implemented it into the dashboard?
3924000	3938000	Oh, because that would have taken too much work. Because before it was like, okay, you have the exit out of your game. You have the exit out of all this other stuff to see information on Twitter or Facebook.
3939000	3953000	But Windows Messenger, you can get messages on that and you can see them pop up. But why can't you just have the same thing on the dashboard for the Xbox 360 where you can pop it up immediately, just hit the guide button or something like that and see that.
3954000	3959000	Because that would be too much work. We want you to use our shitty fucking internet browser, Internet Explorer.
3960000	3968000	Yeah, if a console really wanted to be cutting edge, you would have one button. You should be able to press one button and get a menu and hit Facebook and your feed comes right up.
3969000	3975000	None of this loading time, none of this going out of the app, it needs to be embedded or it's useless.
3975000	3986000	I think it's also kind of stupid that, well, I'm sure they're proud of Internet Explorer, but no one's like, fuck yeah, I get to use Internet Explorer on my Xbox. Just call it the Xbox web browser.
3987000	3992000	Because Internet Explorer doesn't mean fucking kick ass, it means fucking garbage is what it means.
3993000	3995000	Because Microsoft is not going to give up on their branding.
3996000	4008000	It's basically the thing I use to go fucking download Firefox or Google Chrome. I use it the one time when I loaded my operating system to download that fucking program if I don't already have it on jump drive.
4009000	4016000	Okay, now here's the thing. I will say this about the Facebook application. There's one thing that I did think was very useful about that Facebook application.
4017000	4023000	You could go in and you could instantly see what your friends, your people on Facebook, what their gamer tags were.
4023000	4029000	So if you were like their friend on Facebook and they connected to the Xbox, you could see their gamer tag so you could easily add people to your Xbox friends list.
4030000	4034000	That was useful. I hope they will retain that in some capacity. That's really all I can think of.
4035000	4036000	Of course, they still have not upped the limit.
4037000	4038000	I was just about to say.
4039000	4052000	So I can't add anybody else anyway, but, you know, if somebody decides to, you know, face, if somebody decides to Xbox breakup with me, as this happened in the past, then I'll have a couple slots where I can add more people and I would like them to be people I know on Facebook and what have you.
4053000	4056000	So, let's see.
4057000	4064000	Blackwolf in our chat says, hey guys, remember we could watch videos on our 360 without loading a Zune video app? Those were good times.
4065000	4068000	Yeah, they need to make this stuff easier, not more difficult.
4069000	4070000	Their apps thing is kind of dumb. I mean.
4071000	4075000	It's what bugs me about Mass Effect 3 on Origin and why I keep giving Origin a bad time.
4076000	4087000	Origin, if you want to get it right, I should be able to load Mass Effect 3 and instantly go into a multiplayer game. Instantly. Not five minutes later.
4088000	4089000	And not have to verify my DLC.
4090000	4099000	That's the stuff that's starting to bug me. That's what's going to keep the holodeck from happening. Bullshit. Bullshit is going to stop the holodeck from happening.
4100000	4104000	Yes, we're headed towards the holodeck, but we are having to go through so much bullshit to get there.
4106000	4110000	I'm sorry, we can't authenticate your person because you've gotten a haircut.
4111000	4115000	Come back in two months once your hair has grown out. It's ridiculous.
4116000	4125000	Just remember how they were talking about, and I don't even know anybody that would ever do this, where you would leave your Xbox 360 on and Kinect would recognize your face and log you in.
4126000	4133000	Or I can hit the guide button and just log myself in, probably infinitely faster than that stupid thing.
4133000	4134000	And I don't have to have Kinect hooked up.
4135000	4143000	SSG100Matt in our chatroom says, at live.vognetwork.com says, where is my MySpace or GeoCities app? Didn't GeoCities finally officially close?
4144000	4148000	It's totally gone. MySpace, however, is coming back, baby.
4149000	4161000	To be fair, I use the Twitter app in Xbox about as often as I use, well, maybe a couple more times on the Vita, but I haven't really used it on the Vita or the Facebook app.
4162000	4171000	Because I have a phone. It's cool they have this integration, and weren't they going to have it where you can send screenshots of your gameplay and stuff like that on Facebook?
4171000	4174000	Some games have that, like NBA, 2K13, or whatever.
4175000	4177000	Like, yeah, why don't we just add that to all games instead of just, you know...
4178000	4193000	Here's the other thing. Like, I'm now going to access Twitter on my phone. Okay? Ready? Tap. Tap. Wait. There's my feed. It's up, and it's already refreshed.
4194000	4199000	That's how long it took me to get Twitter up on my phone. That's why I prefer to use my phone, because you know how long that would have taken me to do on my Vita?
4200000	4202000	You know, opening...
4205000	4207000	And then, like, oh, downloading new update.
4208000	4211000	And then, like, oh, going to connecting to Twitter.
4212000	4216000	Downloading tweets. Like, it doesn't work that fast. That's the problem.
4217000	4220000	Hooray for you getting Twitter. Now make it work better.
4221000	4223000	So, anyway.
4224000	4226000	Let's move on with Dark Soccer.
4226000	4234000	Actually, real quick, I was going to say it's even more ironic, the fact that they're getting rid of Facebook and Twitter, is how integrated that stuff is in Windows 8.
4235000	4241000	It kind of seems a little backwards that we're getting this Windows 8 dashboard thing on the Xbox, and yet they're not having that same type of integration.
4242000	4246000	Well, maybe they're able to do it instantly on the desktop, where they are having that problem on the Xbox for whatever reason.
4247000	4249000	Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
4250000	4251000	Tangled Yarn.
4252000	4253000	Are you knitting during the show?
4254000	4255000	I'm crocheting, thank you.
4256000	4261000	My ball of cheap-ass yarn has got a tangle in it. Never buy yarn from the dollar store.
4262000	4268000	Anyway, how many people liked Elder Scrolls III and liked Oblivion?
4269000	4270000	Me.
4271000	4272000	Who liked Kingdoms of Amalur?
4273000	4274000	I didn't play it.
4275000	4276000	Far less people.
4277000	4279000	I hear it's not bad. I don't think we should give it too much shit.
4279000	4289000	Well, the lead designer for those two Elder Scrolls games, Ken Rolston, jumped ship. He's off with Turbine Now, which is the developer for Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons and Dragons Online.
4290000	4295000	Which I'm kind of playing Lotor, but kind of. It's pretty. It's got cherry blossoms, so I like it.
4295000	4318000	Basically, I'm trying to see if I can. Yeah, he basically said they're really excited to have him, and I guess that the Elder Scrolls franchise will just have to keep going with whoever the new people are.
4319000	4322000	Well, he didn't have Skyrim on his resume. That game turned out alright.
4322000	4331000	But still, I'm not this guy, obviously. It's a name I've heard before, and I know he's contributed a lot to these franchises, so I think any company is lucky to have him.
4332000	4333000	And he's wearing a beret.
4335000	4336000	Which instantly makes somebody awesome.
4337000	4337000	
4338000	4343000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games you can look forward to real soon, and it is getting to be that time of year, right?
4344000	4345000	It's already been that time of year for a few weeks now.
4346000	4348000	Yeah, I mean, next month's a huge month, right?
4349000	4350000	It's not so bad.
4350000	4357000	But yeah, there's a lot of games coming out. This week, of course, we had Skylanders Giants come out today, along with all those wonderful packs and stuff.
4358000	4361000	That was on PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the 3DS and PC.
4362000	4372000	On the Vita this week, we get Street Fighter X Tekken. On PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Medal of Honor Warfighter.
4372000	4381000	On PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013. Also, they have a bundle with this Fear Master gun. It senses your fear!
4382000	4384000	Your fear of playing a mediocre game, but it senses it!
4387000	4391000	That game, that should be a gun for Silent Hill or something like that.
4392000	4393000	Fear gun.
4394000	4395000	It senses your heart.
4395000	4402000	It senses your heart. It's basically the Nintendo... that sensor thing that never came out.
4403000	4404000	The Vitality sensor.
4405000	4408000	Yes, it's the Vitality sensor for Cabela's... yeah.
4409000	4412000	And then they also have Cabela's Hunting expeditions on the same systems as well.
4413000	4417000	Maybe that was something that was originally being developed for the Vitality sensor, but when that kind of went away...
4418000	4418000	
4419000	4420000	Alright, maybe not.
4421000	4423000	Just Dance Disney Party on Xbox 360 in the Wii.
4423000	4424000	Woohoo!
4425000	4430000	Zero Escape Virtues Last Reward on 3DS in the Vita.
4431000	4433000	Let's see what else we got here.
4434000	4439000	Also this week, Myst on the 3DS. I think it's been delayed a few weeks.
4440000	4441000	Hopefully it's coming out this week.
4442000	4445000	Naughty Bear Double Trouble on PS3, and it's both mediocre Naughty Bear games.
4445000	4452000	4's Horizon on Xbox 360 as well as the collector's edition of that.
4455000	4456000	What else we got here?
4457000	4460000	Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits on the Vita.
4461000	4462000	They are still trying, huh?
4463000	4463000	
4464000	4471000	Smart As on the... not Smart Ass, Smart As with one S on the Vita.
4472000	4474000	That's also this week. That's supposed to be a brain training game.
4475000	4477000	And let's see here.
4478000	4482000	They've got some controller kind of game combos.
4483000	4487000	So they're re-releasing the God of War Saga collection with a red dual-shot controller.
4488000	4490000	They also have the infamous collection with a metallic blue controller.
4491000	4498000	And what was the last one? It was another one of their collections that they released with a silver controller.
4499000	4501000	I don't remember. It's not important. Those games already are out.
4502000	4505000	And last but not least, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask on the 3DS.
4506000	4510000	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out what's happening there. Quite a bit, actually.
4511000	4518000	On the Xbox 360 this week, October 25th, you get Borderlands 2, 4's Horizon, Phantom of Inferno,
4519000	4523000	Zone of the Ender's HD edition, which I bet some people are very interested in.
4524000	4525000	Probably creaming their pants.
4525000	4530000	Exactly. Over on the PlayStation 3 this week, some of the same stuff. Zone of the Ender's HD edition.
4531000	4532000	Muv Luv.
4533000	4534000	That sounds a little...
4535000	4540000	Muv Luv and Muv Luv Alternative are out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4541000	4542000	Is that Muv Luv or Muff Luv?
4543000	4550000	I almost said Muff Luv, but it is Muv Luv. I want to say it's an anime, but then again, yet again, here we are. I love this.
4550000	4556000	I'm sorry, this is too great. I gotta post a screenshot chat. I'm so sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see this.
4557000	4563000	But look this game up. Muv dash Luv, okay? Because look at this. You got these Japanese girls in school outfits, duh duh duh duh duh,
4564000	4569000	and this one is sucking on a hot dog in the corner, and then what the fuck is this bitch down here?
4570000	4570000	
4571000	4571000	
4572000	4575000	She's in a barrel or a bundle of sticks or something.
4576000	4579000	I've gotta post that for the chatties. Hold on. Here you go.
4580000	4581000	That is amazing.
4581000	4588000	That is absolutely amazing. I love it. Now wait, what's Muv Luv Alternative? Is that gonna be the one with the dudes on it? Let me see. Hold on.
4589000	4592000	What? This isn't even the same game.
4592000	4593000	Yes it is.
4593000	4598000	Now it's like chick with the sword. Yeah, I know it's the same, but that doesn't even look the same at all.
4598000	4600000	So maybe it's like the dark version.
4601000	4603000	Like one's all about love and one's about killing.
4604000	4609000	One's like the cutesy, happy universe, the other's like the cyber babe universe.
4609000	4616000	Okay, I need help. Live chatters. You guys tend to know this stuff when I don't. What is Muv Luv? Somebody tell me.
4617000	4618000	I've gotta know now.
4619000	4623000	Like they don't say a lot about these games on the, uh, it's an adventure game.
4625000	4627000	Like does that mean- An adventure through panties.
4627000	4630000	Oh wait, here. Oh, there's a YouTube here.
4639000	4641000	Every anime game ever.
4642000	4643000	You know, that told me nothing.
4644000	4646000	Wow, that totally summed it up for me.
4646000	4648000	I know, it's like, oh, it's like an anime.
4648000	4654000	It's even bigger, even more love, something. Play it again. No, no, don't play it.
4654000	4657000	Jason says it's a visual novel. Read Japanese porn.
4658000	4666000	Well, and to be fair, that is definitely a bundle of straw and not necessarily a, um, a barrel.
4667000	4669000	Alright, anyway, other games-
4669000	4674000	For the record, I have bought a digital, a Japanese digital novel that they had in the U.S.
4674000	4676000	They put it on Sega CD.
4676000	4677000	Oh, right, right.
4677000	4680000	Um, it was by the guy who created Cobra.
4681000	4687000	Uh, PlayStation 3 this week in Japan also gets Heartful Simulator Pochi Slot to Heart II.
4687000	4689000	Pochi Slot means, you know what, pachinko game.
4690000	4692000	Oh, Two Hearts, um, anime series.
4692000	4699000	Dark Souls with Atorias of the Abyss Edition, I'm assuming that's the Dark Souls DLC bundled with a regular game.
4699000	4705000	Borderlands 2, BioShock in a 2K collection, price reduction, I'm assuming gearing up for the sequel next year.
4705000	4709000	And Killzone Trilogy, also released on the PlayStation 3.
4709000	4712000	Again, these are all Japanese releases this week.
4712000	4716000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, Street Fighter X Tekken in Japan,
4716000	4722000	as well as next rev, Kaigo Fukushishi Shiken comes out as well.
4722000	4731000	Uh, on the Nintendo 3DS this week, um, AKB48 plus me?
4731000	4733000	Oh, good lord, it's like a little girl group.
4733000	4734000	Oh, is it?
4734000	4744000	Yeah, AKB48 is like this, um, I guess it's kind of, um, this pop group that keeps cycling in, you know, kind of like Minuto was, you know?
4744000	4745000	Sure, sure.
4745000	4746000	Yeah.
4746000	4747000	Or, um, Morning Musume?
4747000	4748000	Yeah, kind of.
4748000	4750000	But Morning Musume was also like a variety show.
4750000	4751000	Oh, right, right.
4751000	4756000	But AKB48, like, they're like top 40 list everything, so.
4756000	4757000	Cool.
4757000	4759000	Well, there it is, your Japanese release dates.
4759000	4761000	Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
4762000	4764000	As soon as I get to the list.
4764000	4766000	Uh, let's see.
4766000	4773000	We have, well, on today, which means it's already yesterday there, um, I wanted to say it was Cairo, but it's KALRO.
4773000	4774000	K-A-L-R-O.
4774000	4777000	Then on the 23rd, there's Hotline Miami.
4777000	4780000	Killzone HD and Medal of Honor Warfighter.
4780000	4784000	On the 24th, Killzone Trilogy PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
4784000	4787000	The 25th, Incredipede.
4787000	4793000	And the 26th, Forza Horizon Roller Coaster Tycoon and Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.
4793000	4797000	Not to be confused with the TV show of the same name from the 60s.
4799000	4802000	So, thanks to the chatters, did a little research.
4802000	4808000	Muv Luv, uh, it was an adult game on the PC in February of 2003.
4808000	4813000	They redid these with the adult content removed on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
4813000	4814000	Boo.
4814000	4815000	I know, right? What's the point?
4815000	4821000	Uh, Muv Luv Extra, Muv Luv Unlimited, and then Muv Luv Alternative came out a little later in 2006.
4821000	4830000	So I'm assuming this is some type of repackaged stuff, or it's like the game's re-, you know, revised, uprezzed, or whatever, reimagining.
4830000	4837000	So, yeah, cause, they, they show later release dates there, October 25th on the PlayStation 3.
4837000	4839000	So, I guess this game's been around a little while.
4839000	4842000	I just have never played it, but now I kinda want to.
4842000	4845000	I gotta know, I gotta know what the girl in the straw is all about.
4847000	4852000	Alright, uh, let's see, that's release dates. A couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.
4852000	4854000	We have, by the way, been graced with Maruko.
4854000	4857000	Hello, Maruko. Did he finally decide to stop being shy?
4857000	4859000	Yeah, he let me scratch his butt.
4859000	4860000	Oh, nice.
4860000	4862000	Stick his tail in the air, look at him, look at my butt.
4862000	4865000	That's the closest I've ever seen him get to Loki. He must be getting used to it.
4865000	4866000	Alright, anyhow.
4867000	4869000	We interrupt, smell like other, other cats.
4869000	4872000	We interrupt this kitty appearance for more gaming news.
4873000	4876000	Alright, um, so let's talk a little bit about Steam Greenlight.
4876000	4883000	They've got some new games that have been given the go-ahead, and those are, um, 21 new games, and this is kinda cool.
4883000	4885000	Some of these I actually backed on Kickstarter.
4885000	4896000	Um, let's see, After Fall, Insanity, Extended Edition, Air Buccaneers, Bloxscape, Contrast, Flyin', Folktale, Forge, the Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams, which is Project Giana.
4896000	4898000	That was the one I backed, and it's fuckin' awesome. Cool.
4898000	4903000	Um, uh, Ginorm, Ginoria, I guess.
4903000	4906000	Nomoria? No, Nomoria, that's what it was.
4906000	4914000	Uh, Interstellar Marines, Lost Story, The Last Days of Earth, um, Miasamata, uh, Minor Wars 2081, Neo-Tokyo, which is a pretty awesome.
4914000	4922000	Um, uh, Source, uh, Mod, Octodad, Dadliest Catch, which is supposed to be pretty awesome.
4922000	4935000	Um, Perpetuum, Postal 2 Complete, The Secrets of, um, Grendia, The Intruder, The Stanley Parable, HD Remix, which is also supposed to be a pretty awesome Source game.
4935000	4944000	And Yogg Ventures, those are gonna be, um, the 21 new games that they're gonna be adding to the Steam store at some point soon.
4944000	4960000	And then also, um, of course, the non-gaming area, which they added recently, is also added to Steam Greenlight as well, so now you can, uh, begin voting on submissions for other stuff that's not necessarily software.
4960000	4965000	And, uh, don't know what exactly is on there yet, but I'm probably gonna go poke around that at some point.
4965000	4971000	Um, and last but not least, they're also adding a new thing to Steam Greenlight, which is called Concepts.
4971000	4981000	It basically allows you to post your game without the $100 fee to gauge, kind of, interest in what people would want to, you know, if people would be even interested in your game.
4981000	4987000	And so if you get a lot of interest, then you may pony up the $100 to, you know, have it actually greenlit and put on the Steam store. So, that's kinda neat.
4987000	4992000	Sounds like that project's doing very well for them.
4992000	4994000	Yeah, it sounds pretty cool.
4994000	5000000	Awesome, awesome. Alright, one more story for you guys, then we'll get into the classic game of the week.
5000000	5005000	Uh, this is another legal story. Uh, this is kinda, uh, wow.
5005000	5015000	Uh, Dave Rushton, who was the founder and president of Sensory Sweep Studios, they were in Utah, he got sentenced to 12 months in the slamma.
5015000	5021000	Fined $1.2 million in unpaid wages to more than 100 employees.
5021000	5026000	This goes all the way back to a lawsuit from 2009 by the US Department of Labor.
5026000	5032000	Uh, apparently, employees claimed they were not paid in over 100 days for their work.
5032000	5036000	The employees also alleged their 401k money had been stolen by the company.
5036000	5041000	Uh, Dave Rushton has already served jail time for other charges relating to the company.
5042000	5051000	He pled guilty to one third degree felony charge of failing to file taxes and one second degree felony charge of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity.
5051000	5053000	This is all according to the Salt Lake Tribune.
5053000	5057000	Uh, 200 hours of community service, 72 months probation.
5057000	5059000	What did Sensory Sweep Studios do?
5059000	5066000	They were doing ports and license games on the DS, such as Need for Speed Most Wanted, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends,
5066000	5072000	uh, some console games like Alvin and the Chipmunks, or Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting for XBLA.
5072000	5078000	So that was some of the stuff that the studio did, and apparently, their people weren't getting paid for it.
5078000	5080000	How not to run your business.
5080000	5081000	You gotta pay your-
5081000	5085000	That's right, you gotta, you know, if you're gonna, you know, hire people, you do have to send them a paycheck at some point,
5085000	5088000	or they might get angry, cause they're kinda waiting on you to pay them.
5088000	5093000	So they can, like, pay their mortgage, you know, it's kinda things they wanna do.
5094000	5097000	And you, you probably wanna pay your taxes, as well.
5097000	5100000	Especially, um, when you are, you know, the head of a company like that.
5100000	5103000	But, you know, you can just ride it off, you know, for your horse.
5103000	5110000	Or if you're, if you're a singer, you know, like Lauryn Hill, or, uh, who else got busted for tax evasion?
5110000	5115000	Like, they, they get caught, the guy who won Survivor, they all end up getting caught, so.
5115000	5117000	Uh, Wesley Snipes?
5117000	5119000	Yeah, that's right, that's right, that was a big one too.
5119000	5122000	But remember, you know, that's how they, that's how they got Capone.
5122000	5124000	That's right, that's right.
5124000	5125000	That's how they got Capone.
5125000	5131000	Alright, uh, let's travel to a classic time, maybe not as classic as Dark Soccer is referring to.
5131000	5136000	But let's go back a few years, into gaming's history.
5136000	5143000	And a classic video game that Dark Soccer thinks, hey, brats, play this game, or else, I'll kill you.
5143000	5144000	If you can find it, good luck.
5144000	5148000	Yeah, if you can find it. This, I, I honestly, I can say tonight's game, I had never fuckin' heard of this game.
5148000	5150000	I had never heard of this game.
5150000	5152000	Wesley, you've got the Namco collection, right?
5152000	5154000	Yeah, I guess I missed it, somehow.
5154000	5159000	No, not on PlayStation 1, I don't. I have the PlayStation 3 version with Arkaneo.
5159000	5160000	Oh, yeah.
5160000	5167000	Well, the game in question, and I'm going back to the original and its sequel, because I, I really can't mention one without the other,
5167000	5171000	is, um, Valkyrie no Boken, Toki no Kagi Densetsu.
5171000	5177000	Um, the game, uh, title translates to The Adventure of Valkyrie, the Legend of the Time Key.
5178000	5182000	And it came out on, this is the Famicom version.
5182000	5183000	Right.
5183000	5187000	Which is sort of overhead-y, Zelda-ish, scroll-y.
5187000	5190000	It actually, with the way the enemies appear, makes me think of Zelda 2.
5190000	5191000	Mm-hmm.
5191000	5192000	And the other-
5192000	5193000	But I love the music.
5193000	5196000	Can I just say the other English name people would know this by? Legend of the Valkyrie.
5196000	5197000	No, that's actually the sequel.
5197000	5198000	Oh, my bad, okay.
5198000	5200000	Which is why I said two games.
5200000	5201000	Oh, okay. Oops.
5201000	5202000	Yeah.
5202000	5213000	Um, so basically for the original one, you're in Marvel Land, and, uh, basically you have to, uh, get the Key of Time back from whoever stole it.
5213000	5223000	And, you know, it's kind of, it actually really has a lot in common with Dragon Warrior, and the real-time combat system of, uh, The Legend of Zelda.
5223000	5230000	Now, this was, um, it has absolutely no text in the game.
5230000	5240000	Um, there is a patch that changes the title screen if you've got, uh, the, uh, uh, like if you're playing it on an emulator.
5240000	5247000	And, um, look for the one that was done by, uh, DVD Translations. That one is the best.
5247000	5252000	Now, there is, um, a, uh, sequel.
5252000	5258000	And this is the one that people have probably heard of, is Valkyrie no Densetsu, which is, uh, The Legend of the Valkyrie.
5258000	5264000	And this came out in 1989, um, as an arcade game, and then it came out on the PC Engine in Japan.
5264000	5268000	And it is the sequel to the 1986, uh, Famicom game.
5268000	5274000	This one also came out in the US as part of Namco Museum Volume 5, the O.
5274000	5279000	Um, and, uh, the PC Engine version came out on the Virtual Console in Japan.
5279000	5282000	And this one is basically a two-player game.
5282000	5291000	The player one has Valkyrie, and the second one has Crenosandra, which was romanized actually as, uh, Zandra, or then X-A-N-D-R-A.
5291000	5301000	And was named, um, Whirlo in the, uh, English version of, uh, the prequel, which was, uh, Zandra no Daibouken Valkyrie no...
5301000	5306000	Valkyrie Tonodei, I think is how it's pronounced. Um, who's a green lizard.
5307000	5316000	And basically it's, you know, a lot of over, over the world, you know, scrolling, shooting, punching enemies in the face with your sword.
5316000	5321000	Going into little huts and buying stuff. It's, it's such an adorable game.
5321000	5329000	And, if people don't have the O from the Namco collection, which as I understand, the O is a little hard to find.
5330000	5340000	Um, get this game. It was a really, really fun little game, and it is fully translated and available in the U.S. if you can find the, uh, the Namco O.
5340000	5349000	Um, it actually though has a different ending from the arcade version. Um, with the home version you do have a level save.
5349000	5354000	And I actually have, um, Rob, I've got the Famicom version of the first game.
5354000	5360000	And I have the Hu-Card of this too. So I was very happy to pick those up.
5360000	5365000	And I mean, it's just really, it's a straightforward little, you know, adventure game.
5366000	5371000	It's very Zelda slash Dragon Quest-y.
5371000	5375000	I don't know why, maybe it's the cartoony style or something, but I'm suddenly reminded of Whirlo.
5375000	5376000	Yeah.
5376000	5380000	Which, God, I love that game. I was just thinking about, like, I wanna play Whirlo again.
5380000	5384000	It's like all the little monsters in the little Valkyrie are all chibi and adorable.
5384000	5385000	Yeah.
5385000	5390000	And, I mean, but you can get super, uh, uh, powered up.
5390000	5395000	Now, you see how on this video here we're watching, um, how she's jumping from platform to platform?
5395000	5401000	That used to always screw me up because I would think that it was over the regular ground and I'd walk off of them.
5402000	5406000	I mean, I know better, but the first time I tried to play it, it was actually pretty difficult.
5406000	5409000	I wanna check this video out over here. I'm hoping some dude isn't talking over this.
5409000	5412000	But this says it's the main version, so I'm assuming this is just a direct arcade version.
5412000	5415000	I'm gonna hope it's without any dudes talking over it.
5416000	5417000	Let me see what happens here.
5417000	5418000	Yeah.
5418000	5419000	Okay, good.
5420000	5421000	Oh, this looks, okay.
5421000	5423000	It's pretty much the same thing.
5423000	5428000	Yeah, it's, it's, uh, it definitely has that arcade style interface though, but okay.
5428000	5430000	But, I mean, the PC Engine version is damn cool.
5430000	5432000	The engine version is damn good.
5432000	5433000	Yeah.
5434000	5436000	Hmm, I'll have to check this out at some point.
5436000	5448000	Now, I'll tell you where I first heard about this game is I had, um, a, uh, gachapon, uh, capsule that was a little Namco figurine set.
5448000	5451000	Dan and I tried to collect all of them and one of them was a Valkyrie.
5451000	5453000	And I was like, oh, this is pretty cool.
5453000	5456000	And then it turned out that, hey, there's this whole game and you should play it.
5456000	5459000	And, oh, yeah, we actually have that because we have it on the Namco.
5459000	5462000	Oh, and it's just really cute, really fun.
5462000	5464000	I suggest that everyone try to get your hands on it.
5464000	5467000	I mean, Valkyrie no Boken is pretty cool.
5467000	5480000	And, like I said, there was a prequel, um, released for the SNES called Zandra no Daiboken, Valkyrie tono, uh, Valkyrie tono dei, I think I'm pronouncing that right.
5480000	5486000	And pulling this one up, that translates to, um, Zandra's Great Adventure, a counter with the Valkyrie.
5486000	5489000	And that's the little green lizard man meeting up with the Valkyrie chick.
5489000	5492000	And that one, though, is a side-scrolling game.
5492000	5494000	It's a lot different.
5494000	5501000	I usually, I'd say that for any of them, my favorite of the three is the, um, Valkyrie no Densetsu.
5501000	5503000	So, totally awesome game.
5503000	5507000	And that's the classic game and I'm sticking to it.
5507000	5509000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
5509000	5519000	A couple of games there, but, uh, we'll say Valkyrie no Densetsu, uh, as that seems to be the one that, you know, if you're gonna go find this game, that's probably gonna be the one you're gonna find.
5519000	5528000	Yeah, it's, if you wanna play it in English, it's on the Namco, uh, classics, which was, uh, the PlayStation version.
5528000	5530000	And it's the letter O.
5530000	5531000	There you go.
5531000	5533000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
5533000	5535000	That is a nice, obscure pick.
5535000	5536000	I like that.
5536000	5539000	Uh, alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5539000	5545000	There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come for tonight, including your emails, or is it lack thereof, once again.
5545000	5549000	Uh, also we're gonna have some news on some things going on with Kickstarter.
5549000	5554000	More lawsuit news and you are not gonna believe what happened with this PC release.
5554000	5559000	The Fubo Question of the Week and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5559000	5567000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5567000	5576000	We are live on this October the 21st of 2012 with the 478th episode of our show, uh, during the music break there.
5576000	5582000	We can't play these on the podcast because, you know, copyright reasons and all that, but I will say we played a song there from 2nd Detsetsu 3.
5582000	5587000	It was, uh, given the, uh, chatters a hard time trying to figure out what, uh, game that was from.
5587000	5590000	Did anybody ever play that when it had the translated cartridge? Yeah, I played that, too.
5590000	5591000	I played through about half of it.
5591000	5598000	Yeah, yeah. I still say, though, to this day, Secret of Evermore was sadly hazed and underrated by, uh, the folks here.
5598000	5610000	I thought Secret of Evermore wasn't a bad game, although I do understand it was a different, you know, it was the, the one square USA title that, you know, for whatever reason, people didn't seem to like it as much, but, anyhow.
5611000	5618000	Uh, Loki, before we get into rapid fire news, you were playing during the break there, this interesting music shooter game you were mentioning before?
5618000	5639000	Yeah, I had mentioned it on the show before because it was something like Kickstarter, it was called Rhythm Destruction, and since they got funded and their Kickstarting ended, um, basically, I think it was like 5 bucks, and you get the game, and the game, it's interesting because the way it plays, it's, it's a shooter, uh, like a top-down shooter, space shooter, I guess, but all the shooting is done as, like, a rhythm game.
5640000	5656000	So, the enemies, you know, come on the screen, you see, like, a circle come around them, and you have to hit them with the, be the music, and it uses an Xbox 360 controller, so they're mapped to the face buttons, and then all the dodging of, like, bullets and stuff is done with the analog sticks, and your, you know, triggers are kind of like a boost type of thing.
5656000	5666000	So, you're dodging stuff and having to do the rhythm game part, which is kind of really cool, and it's got music from, like, Kyle Wardner, I was playing one that was a Caw song, so.
5667000	5671000	He shows up in the strangest places, music game-wise, doesn't he? Good for him, good for him.
5671000	5673000	Yeah, but, uh, it's a pretty awesome game, so.
5673000	5674000	Gotta pay the bills!
5674000	5692000	Yeah, well, exactly, so I'm not really sure where, I think you can buy it off their website, um, I'm trying to remember where it is, because, you know, obviously, um, I don't think they, I think they're trying to get, um, onto the Steam store, I don't know if they've done it, I, oh yeah, here we go.
5692000	5701000	RhythmDestruction.com, you can check it out, it's by a company called Curious Pandas, the, uh, group that did it, and I think you can, I think you can buy it.
5701000	5702000	Pandas, you say?
5702000	5718000	Yes, pandas, I think you can buy the game, um, maybe, let's see here, yeah, there's a buy it now on the website, I'm trying to see, $4.99 is all they're asking for, and you pay for it, with PayPal, they have, so.
5718000	5719000	Well, good luck!
5719000	5720000	It's pretty awesome.
5720000	5721000	I like music games, I like shooters.
5721000	5725000	It's worth it, I mean, it's a pretty awesome game, so, check it out.
5725000	5726000	Alright.
5727000	5735000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, brain.
5735000	5743000	Let's get into some rapid fire news before we get to the FUGL question of the week, which tonight is all about, zinga, it'll be fun, uh, Loki.
5743000	5749000	Alright, so, Ubisoft has this really weird tie-in, um, or promotional thing for Far Cry 3.
5749000	5755000	What they're gonna be doing is actually promoting Far Cry 3 with a free Minecraft map and texture pack.
5755000	5768000	The free pack, I guess, is coming, um, to PCs on the 26th, I think that's around the time that 1.4 update comes, and, um, they'll be adding Far Cry 3 locations and character skins.
5769000	5773000	And then, of course, the game, you know, Far Cry 3 comes out on the 4th in, uh, North America.
5773000	5783000	It's kind of a weird thing, but they have, they even did some promo screenshots where, you know, some of the screenshots from Minecraft, or, I'm sorry, Far Cry 3 have, like, Minecraft weapons in there.
5783000	5789000	Which makes you kind of wonder, is that gonna be something, like, hidden in the game that you can get Minecraft knives and stuff like that?
5789000	5794000	I was gonna say, could you, could you remind me, what exactly does Minecraft and Far Cry 3 have in common?
5794000	5796000	They have wilderness?
5796000	5797000	What, what relationship-
5797000	5799000	Dirt, Rob. Dirt and water.
5799000	5802000	What relationship does Mojang have to Ubisoft? Like, this is-
5802000	5816000	Perhaps, among, you know, the tigers and other, you know, you know, uh, tribespeople and terrorists or whoever else you might find in the jungle, you're gonna find a creeper.
5816000	5817000	Oh, that's scary.
5817000	5820000	That'd be awesome. Anyway, then, Borderlands 2.
5820000	5821000	Slenderman.
5822000	5823000	Slenderman.
5823000	5827000	Um, Black Ops 2 on the Wii U is not gonna have Call of Duty Elite.
5827000	5834000	Because all the other systems are gonna be getting Call of Duty Elite at launch, because they're kind of doing it as a free thing.
5834000	5842000	And instead of, you know, having to pay 60 bucks for all the perks of Elite, you can get everything for free and then you just pay 60 bucks for a map pack instead.
5842000	5848000	Or the subscription for the map pack, since that's really why they got Elite in the first place.
5849000	5851000	However, the Wii U is not getting the support.
5851000	5856000	It says, we're currently evaluating options for Call of Duty Elite to support Nintendo's Wii U game system.
5856000	5863000	However, Call of Duty Elite for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 will not support this platform when the game launches November 13th.
5863000	5866000	Which makes me wonder, what is borked about their fucking online?
5866000	5868000	Because that's kind of-
5870000	5873000	It makes me wonder, because Call of Duty Elite's kind of like this app thing.
5873000	5880000	Maybe they're not gonna allow these sort of like third-party apps, you know, for the Wii U dashboard or whatever.
5880000	5883000	Well, you know what didn't make the show roll tonight that's worth talking about?
5883000	5886000	Did you hear about the updates with Nintendo Voice Chat?
5887000	5890000	And how they're not selling a headset.
5890000	5893000	They're gonna be third-party headsets.
5893000	5897000	And if you use the Nintendo Pro Controller, there's no space for a headset.
5897000	5902000	So you have to have your Wii pad with the headset and the Wii pad and then your Pro Controller.
5902000	5906000	Not looking good for Nintendo convincing me they understand online finally.
5906000	5908000	Not looking good.
5909000	5912000	I'm surprised we didn't put that story in here, because I could have gone on a whole tangent about that.
5912000	5915000	But yeah, not thrilled by that news.
5916000	5917000	Not at all.
5917000	5923000	It would be not so bad if that system supports Bluetooth and they have like Bluetooth headsets and stereo stuff as well.
5924000	5928000	Or that they're not doing a first-party headset because they're gonna support any headset.
5928000	5935000	Apparently on the gamepad they do have a spot for headphones, but not necessarily a headset type thing.
5935000	5946000	And apparently you can enable it, but at default it's disabled to use the microphone that's actually on the gamepad for chat.
5947000	5948000	I don't know.
5949000	5951000	The fact we haven't heard much about it other than,
5952000	5954000	Hey, check out this like, I don't even know what the fuck they're calling it.
5954000	5957000	The Mii Plaza or whatever the fuck their community thing is.
5957000	5958000	Hey, check this out.
5958000	5961000	Hey, guess what, you can leave messages for friends in games.
5961000	5963000	Okay, well what about accounts?
5963000	5965000	What about like achievements and stuff like that?
5965000	5967000	Hey, check out this like Mii Plaza thing.
5967000	5969000	Hey, you can leave messages for friends in games.
5969000	5970000	I think that's all it's gonna be.
5970000	5971000	I think that's it.
5971000	5972000	I think that and a shop and that's it.
5972000	5977000	I mean, really when you think about it, that's not much more than what they had on the Wii.
5977000	5979000	They had it where you could share your Miis.
5979000	5983000	They had it where you could see, you know, messages from your friends.
5983000	5987000	And now they're kind of adding, you know, a thing where you can leave messages in game.
5988000	5989000	Yippee.
5989000	5993000	Or, you know, see what your friends, other people are playing.
5993000	5995000	Not necessarily friends, I guess.
5996000	5997000	Well, that doesn't make any sense.
5997000	6000000	But yeah, here's something else that's not coming to the Wii U version.
6000000	6004000	And, I mean, really the Wii U version is gonna be kind of similar to the rest of them.
6004000	6005000	I just think, I don't know.
6005000	6008000	I think something's borked with their online that that's how it is.
6008000	6011000	Because this should be something that should be easily implemented.
6012000	6014000	But it's not for whatever reason.
6015000	6017000	And then last one, at least, Obsidian.
6017000	6024000	They've concluded their Project Eternity Kickstarter at 3.9 million dollars raised.
6025000	6031000	And I guess that's even more than Double Fine Adventures has gotten.
6031000	6033000	Because, remember, Double Fine Adventures had 3.3 million.
6033000	6034000	That's right.
6034000	6035000	Wow, good for them.
6035000	6036000	They beat that.
6036000	6042000	And, of course, you know, I guess Planetary Annihilation was another one similar to that.
6042000	6046000	Or, you know, multi-million dollar raise.
6046000	6047000	They got 2.2 million.
6047000	6049000	And the Wii U had 8.5 million.
6049000	6052000	And the thing is, see, I almost backed this.
6052000	6055000	But I saw that the game wasn't coming out until 2014.
6055000	6057000	So, I'll wait, you know.
6057000	6059000	It's just not something I want to back.
6059000	6061000	You need your games to be designed faster.
6062000	6064000	Well, it's just that's kind of a long ways.
6064000	6070000	And I'm assuming that, you know, they're not necessarily going to hit their, you know, date for that stuff.
6070000	6078000	Because, like, for example, the Kickstarter I did for my very first Kickstarter, which was for VGHS, Video Game High School.
6078000	6080000	They still haven't delivered the DVDs on that stuff yet.
6080000	6081000	They're working on it.
6081000	6084000	They've gotten it printed and they're signing copies.
6084000	6086000	They had pictures of them signing the copies of it.
6086000	6088000	But, you know, that was promised back in March.
6088000	6091000	I mean, they didn't even launch the series until, like, later in March.
6091000	6094000	So, yeah.
6094000	6096000	I mean, the stuff gets delayed.
6096000	6099000	But, you know, two years from now.
6101000	6102000	Alright.
6102000	6104000	Well, how about free games?
6104000	6105000	We like free.
6105000	6107000	And this is a very interesting sort of free game.
6108000	6111000	This is being developed by NeoGAF members.
6111000	6113000	You know, the big popular gaming forum, right?
6113000	6117000	I guess they formed a studio called Grimoire Assembly Forge.
6117000	6120000	And they're creating this parody on modern shooters.
6120000	6122000	It's called Dude Bro 2.
6122000	6124000	The actual title is,
6124000	6127000	Dude Bro, my shit is fucked up, so I gotta shoot-slice you too.
6127000	6129000	It's straight-up dog time.
6129000	6130000	Alright.
6130000	6134000	It's based off of a meme that someone was, like, complaining about something.
6134000	6136000	They're like, well, why don't you just go play Dude Bro 2?
6136000	6138000	And so someone's like,
6138000	6142000	So someone started, like, making character art and started doing, like, box art.
6142000	6144000	It's like bungee ferret tossing.
6144000	6145000	Yeah, finally they decided to do it.
6145000	6147000	Somebody took the joke way too far.
6147000	6148000	I gotcha, I gotcha.
6148000	6151000	Apparently, though, here, you wanna talk about the joke going way too far?
6151000	6153000	John St. John.
6153000	6154000	You know John St. John?
6154000	6156000	He is, he is Duke Nukem.
6156000	6157000	He's the voice of Duke Nukem.
6157000	6158000	He will be John Dude Bro.
6158000	6159000	You need to play the song.
6159000	6160000	I think it's in the trailer.
6160000	6162000	Is this the little, the trailer song?
6162000	6163000	I think it's in the trailer.
6163000	6164000	Let me play a little clip of it here.
6166000	6168000	It's straight-up dog time.
6171000	6172000	It gets in this.
6176000	6177000	It's got a rap even.
6178000	6183000	And it looks pretty awesome.
6183000	6186000	It looks very old school.
6186000	6188000	At least in these cutscenes.
6197000	6199000	It looks like Commander Keen or something.
6199000	6201000	That's actually kinda rad.
6201000	6202000	Kinda rad.
6207000	6209000	That's where Duke Nukem got its start, really.
6209000	6211000	That's kinda cool.
6211000	6213000	Hey, I like free.
6213000	6219000	Alright, PlayStation All-Stars apparently have been hacked into Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
6219000	6222000	I don't know how this happened, but yeah, this is some modders.
6222000	6227000	They developed the Smash Bros., but they actually have some of the PlayStation All-Stars.
6227000	6229000	But they put some other people into this as well.
6229000	6232000	Like, Niko Bellic from Grand Theft Auto 4.
6232000	6234000	John Marston from Red Dead Redemption.
6234000	6236000	Lara Croft from Tomb Raider.
6236000	6237000	Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid.
6237000	6241000	I mean, it's a hack, so they don't have to worry about licensing or anything.
6241000	6243000	They just put whoever the fuck they want in there.
6243000	6246000	Kazuya from Tekken, Tomba.
6246000	6248000	Isaac Clark from Dead Space.
6248000	6250000	Get this, Commander Shepard from Mass Effect.
6250000	6252000	But it's Manshep.
6252000	6253000	So it doesn't count.
6254000	6260000	It's a free mod, but again, you know, you will have to mod and do all that stuff.
6260000	6266000	I think those mods, I'm not sure with the whole character skins and models and stuff like that.
6266000	6269000	I think a lot of them you can do with just an SD card.
6269000	6271000	You know, you need to, like, mod your system.
6271000	6275000	I think it's just done through, like, a hacked save type thing, so that might be one of those.
6275000	6277000	I don't know. I haven't really researched it too much.
6278000	6280000	Alright, and one other story about Nintendo Land.
6280000	6284000	The final little mini games inside Nintendo Land have been announced.
6284000	6293000	Captain Falcon's Twister Race, where you hold the narrow end of the Wii U game pad upright to guide a high-speed wind-up vehicle towards the finish line.
6293000	6295000	Octopus Dance.
6297000	6298000	I couldn't say it without laughing.
6298000	6299000	What?
6299000	6301000	It's a single-player rhythm-based game.
6301000	6309000	You use the game pad, you memorize the movement of the character on the screen, and re-enact the poses using the control sticks or the gyro sensor.
6309000	6311000	And lastly, Yoshi's Fruit Cart.
6313000	6315000	What, are you a fan of Yoshi's Fruit Cart, Dark Sakura?
6315000	6316000	His name is Snort.
6316000	6320000	You guide Yoshi's Cart towards the goal while collecting fruit on the way.
6320000	6322000	Oh, well, it's not just a clever name.
6322000	6325000	You can see fruit on the TV, but not the game pad.
6328000	6330000	It sounds like innovation to me.
6330000	6331000	There you go.
6331000	6341000	So, hey, so now you being a big fan of F-Zero, do you think that homage is worthy of, like, you know, you're gonna get the fans excited about F-Zero with this wonderful game?
6341000	6343000	I think they can stop being fucking cockteases is what they can do.
6343000	6344000	That's a big-
6344000	6345000	I hope to hell that-
6345000	6347000	That's a straight-up page, that's a page out of Capcom's book right there.
6347000	6352000	That better be the secret project that Retro or whatever's working on is the new F-Zero.
6352000	6357000	Say, hey, F-Zero wind-up shit that you don't care about that we're at this point.
6357000	6359000	I give no fucks about anything else.
6359000	6361000	It better not be Pilotwings or some shit.
6361000	6363000	It better be fucking F-Zero.
6363000	6364000	So I have to say-
6364000	6365000	We already remade Pilotwings, we only-
6365000	6366000	Exactly!
6366000	6369000	And Pilotwings, the remake of Pilotwings is fucking terrible.
6369000	6371000	Three goddamn things!
6371000	6372000	I won't go that far.
6372000	6374000	Three fucking events.
6374000	6375000	Let's-
6375000	6379000	Way to go Nintendo, way to not, like, even put any effort in.
6379000	6380000	That's Nintendo.
6380000	6386000	Nintendo doing the least bit of work so we can sell some shit that people will buy anyways because we're fucking Nintendo.
6386000	6390000	There just needs to be a Captain Falcon game where all he does is punch people.
6390000	6393000	Now that would have been a classic minigame.
6393000	6395000	That would have been great.
6395000	6397000	Falcon Punch! Falcon Punch!
6397000	6399000	Show me your move.
6399000	6406000	So, um, Pikmin 3 is going to be on the Wii U and no one is excited.
6406000	6411000	Actually, that came from Iwata making that little announcement.
6411000	6415000	Next up, do you want to learn about video games at school, Rob?
6415000	6417000	No! School sucks!
6417000	6419000	Bite me. I like school.
6419000	6428000	There's a class that is at Rice University in Houston, Texas called Scandinavian Fantasy Worlds, Old Norse Sagas, and Skyrim.
6428000	6433000	And basically it's, um, and I'm reading the quote here,
6433000	6438000	Introduce the students to fantasy as both psychological concept and the driving force in gamer culture
6438000	6443000	by having students read selections from Old Norse and Old Icelandic sagas in translation
6443000	6446000	and as they play different quests in Skyrim.
6446000	6450000	And it's pretty awesome because there's a part of the midterm where you get to give your best
6450000	6452000	FUS RO DAH!
6454000	6463000	Last but not least, Just Dance 4 is going to have a song that you can download.
6463000	6469000	Ubisoft has announced this. It's going to be in this download content pack.
6469000	6477000	It's going to be 240 Microsoft points per song, about 2 pounds, 4 bucks, something like that.
6477000	6480000	And it's Gangnam Style.
6480000	6482000	Uh oh.
6482000	6486000	So yeah. I have actually just introduced a friend of mine to the video last night.
6486000	6487000	So it was pretty funny.
6487000	6488000	You know what you did, right?
6488000	6489000	Yeah, I know.
6489000	6490000	You went there.
6495000	6498000	I have the album.
6498000	6500000	All I have to say, look.
6500000	6501000	The album's good.
6501000	6510000	I'm kind of already over this, but it was really weird to turn on the radio on a top 40 station nonetheless
6510000	6518000	and hear this song played, not as an act of parody, not as a lol listen to this, not as hey this is what the kids on the internet are.
6518000	6521000	No, you hear up next, Psy with Gangnam Style.
6521000	6523000	I thought it was just, I thought it was PSY.
6523000	6525000	I think that most people were saying Psy.
6525000	6531000	Because in one of the songs, it does this little thing where they say the name of the person and it's P-S-Y.
6531000	6533000	Well, whatever.
6533000	6539000	But actually it's a good album and I really like, I think the song's called Passionate Goodbye.
6539000	6541000	It's a really good song.
6541000	6543000	So I like the album.
6543000	6546000	And that guy is just super adorable.
6546000	6547000	Have you heard the girl version?
6547000	6548000	No, there's a girl version.
6548000	6556000	Basically everybody in the video, like a lot of the, well not everybody, but most of the people in the video are like real big celebrities in South Korea.
6556000	6560000	And all kinds of just big cameos in that video.
6560000	6565000	And one of the girls that he's with in the video, she does one called Just My Style.
6568000	6572000	Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says just wait until he releases his US album.
6572000	6573000	That is happening.
6573000	6575000	He did get signed to a US label.
6575000	6577000	Buying it.
6578000	6579000	That guy-
6579000	6580000	Justin Bieber's label too.
6580000	6585000	That guy though, not Justin Bieber, but Psy, you have to admit he's super adorable.
6585000	6587000	Have you seen him in interviews and stuff?
6587000	6590000	You just want to pinch his cheeks. He's so cute.
6590000	6595000	And I mean that in a totally bro way.
6595000	6600000	He's really just, I don't know, there's something about him. He's got a great personality.
6600000	6604000	The album, seriously, I think it's like seven bucks on iTunes.
6604000	6609000	And it was totally a worthwhile purchase for me, not just trying to sell it, but it was pretty good.
6609000	6613000	I love driving to it. I'll put it that way. I drive very fast.
6614000	6618000	No, I like the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack if I want to drive fast.
6619000	6621000	I wish they'd do another one of those games.
6621000	6624000	Anyway, let's see, where are we at? What time is it?
6624000	6627000	Oh, it's Fugu Question of the Week time. Hooray.
6635000	6639000	Facebook, smash it with Google+, and together you get Fugu.
6639000	6641000	And that's where our segment comes from.
6641000	6645000	We ask a question in our fan communities every week and we read some of our favorite answers.
6645000	6647000	The question was short and sweet tonight.
6647000	6650000	Obviously, we've been talking a little bit about Zynga and some of the things that have been going on over there.
6650000	6655000	The question this week is, in ten years, how do you think people will remember Zynga?
6655000	6657000	What will their mark on history look like?
6657000	6659000	I want to know, and I'm looking for some serious answers here.
6659000	6662000	I know some of you want to take the cheap, easy way out and say, lol poop.
6663000	6666000	But, you know, I'm really curious. What are they going to be remembered by?
6666000	6669000	Let's see, going to Google+.
6669000	6678000	Retertainment says, I believe the answer to this question will depend on how many of the people who currently actively play Zynga games will, in ten years' time, succumb to dementia.
6678000	6683000	Okay, it's ten years. Ten, not forty-five. It's ten.
6684000	6689000	Let's see, Legend668 on Google+, says, Zyng who?
6689000	6691000	Already fading from my mind.
6692000	6694000	Monster B says, what was Zynga?
6695000	6698000	And Sean F says, no, people may not remember Facebook.
6700000	6702000	That's actually a good point, though.
6702000	6705000	How much longer is the Facebook fad going to last?
6705000	6709000	Their stock sure doesn't seem to indicate it will last much longer. I don't know.
6709000	6711000	But people can't stop using it.
6711000	6717000	Anyway, if you want to see more answers from Google+, head to our community, Orange Lounge Radio, on Google+.
6717000	6719000	Those are some of the answers tonight.
6719000	6731000	Going to Facebook and some of the answers we got on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio for our Frugal Question of the Week about Zynga.
6732000	6734000	Sorry, I'm waiting for it to load.
6734000	6737000	There we go. Oh yes, I remember this story from Bobby Black Wolf.
6737000	6743000	I know I'll forever remember them as the only company I ever said no to when their recruiter contacted me.
6743000	6745000	It's probably for the best.
6745000	6754000	Code Man says, a company that made a very addictive crack kind of addicting games and secretly taking our money like a reverse tooth fairy.
6755000	6756000	Dude, you've given them money?
6756000	6757000	Secretly?
6759000	6761000	You just admitted something on the show. I'm just kidding.
6762000	6773000	Lauren T says, a company that decided that getting new users is more important than fixing the games they already had correctly and almost completely alienating its loyal players.
6774000	6780000	That's a very good answer from Lauren. A company that alienated its loyal players. How not to do...
6780000	6782000	Why are you showing me animated gifs while I'm trying to do this segment?
6782000	6783000	Because this is in the chat room.
6784000	6785000	What is...
6785000	6787000	There's a football player doing the gunk and stuff.
6787000	6788000	Oh, is he real?
6791000	6793000	I didn't even catch that at first. Alright, can I read the answers from Facebook?
6793000	6794000	Yeah, I guess.
6795000	6801000	Red The Hay says, it'll be remembered as that company that made those games like those other games but wasn't game loft.
6802000	6811000	AZHP says, I'm guessing if people still talk about them in 10 years, they'll talk about Zynga the same way that people who talk about Neopets do now.
6812000	6814000	Remember when Neopets was a thing, Dark Sakura?
6815000	6816000	Lord, I do. I played it.
6817000	6829000	Well, we were talking about how technology is like advancing so fast and stuff that in 10 years, who knows if that type of gaming will be even popular because they'll have stuff that's like comparable to what we're playing on consoles right now on the mobile devices.
6830000	6832000	Acidic Vampire says, is that a legendary Pokemon?
6835000	6841000	Tiger Claw says, in 10 years, they will be known as the one company to single-handedly destroy the concept of social gaming.
6841000	6843000	That's pretty powerful stuff there, but perhaps.
6845000	6850000	Burr responded saying, we'll remember Zynga the same way we remember MySpace compared to 10 years ago.
6850000	6857000	Although, honestly, to be in a retentive here for a minute, was MySpace really a thing 10 years ago or was that when Friendster was the big deal?
6857000	6859000	10 years is a long time in tech terms.
6859000	6860000	You know I never used Friendster.
6861000	6862000	Did you? Really?
6862000	6863000	Yeah, I never used it.
6863000	6864000	Never used it?
6864000	6865000	Never.
6865000	6875000	Let's see. Matt J said, they will forever be remembered by me as that company with those horrible apps I had to block, which was responsible for the downturn of Facebook.
6877000	6879000	Let's see. Other answers here.
6880000	6882000	Steven M says, Farmville, that's it.
6883000	6891000	Hitstun says, Zynga taught us an all-important lesson. If you want your game to make the big bucks, it doesn't have to be original or good, it just has to be annoying.
6891000	6892000	And end with Ville.
6893000	6894000	And end with Ville.
6894000	6897000	I'm going to read this long answer here from Matt J because it's pretty good.
6897000	6903000	Truthfully, in my opinion, they'll certainly be remembered. I feel that they'll be remembered for a couple of things.
6903000	6905000	Well, really, just for Farmville and the legacy it created.
6905000	6910000	It helped to create a market for Facebook games, really for social network games in general.
6910000	6915000	I mean, I do believe there were some before Farmville, but they never really got the light of day they have now until Farmville.
6915000	6923000	Zynga will be remembered in the end for creating the Farmville phenomenon and helping to create a new gaming platform.
6923000	6926000	Farmville is the game that got so many into Facebook gaming.
6926000	6932000	Surely there will be some footnotes in the history books for Zynga seemingly stealing ideas from others and the lawsuits involved.
6932000	6937000	Sure, some will remember the foaming hatred some in the gaming community had and have for Zynga.
6937000	6941000	However, most will simply remember one little word, Farmville.
6941000	6944000	That will be the biggest thing Zynga will be remembered for.
6944000	6948000	Farmville and helping launch the Facebook social network gaming phenomenon.
6948000	6956000	Pretty good answer there that, you know, hate them all you want now, but when you look back on history, it's really going to be about Farmville and the social stuff.
6956000	6961000	Good answers from everybody. I'm sorry I didn't have time to read them all, but a whole lot of you responded tonight.
6961000	6966000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to read all of the answers, which were very good.
6966000	6973000	I'll remember the day that someone drew a tank through their business and spelled out Sega in bullets.
6973000	6975000	What?
6975000	6977000	Oh, I'm sorry. That hasn't happened yet.
6977000	6981000	Don't say that kind of stuff on this show. I don't want the po-po coming over.
6981000	6991000	I think it would be, you can remember them by the fact that they probably popularized freemium gaming and made it a little bit more popular as far as like a business model that everybody's going to start using.
6992000	7002000	I'll remember the day that I blocked Farmville and I'll remember every other day that Facebook has unblocked Farmville.
7002000	7004000	I'm a little ashamed to say that I did play Farmville.
7004000	7005000	I will tell you this.
7005000	7007000	I played it to impress a guy.
7007000	7012000	I never played Farmville. Never touched it. And when I blocked it, I never got another thing for it.
7012000	7017000	However, my mother would keep saying, why are my cows dying or something like that?
7017000	7021000	I'd be like, you don't have cows, mom. You've never loo- oh.
7021000	7027000	Cows dying now. Digimon, you know, dying.
7027000	7029000	Hey, I love Digimon.
7029000	7032000	I like Digimon better than Pokemon. I'll play that one.
7032000	7034000	Tamagotchi? Is that what you're trying to think of? Yeah.
7034000	7037000	Alright, let's do some more long news, Lowkey.
7037000	7039000	Neopets. Anyways.
7039000	7041000	So, Ubisoft.
7041000	7044000	Wait, hold on. I gotta correct something Blackwool said in chat.
7045000	7049000	Blackwool said, Alan likes Farmville. Confirmed. No, this was pre-Alan.
7049000	7052000	This was another guy several years ago when Farmville first came out.
7052000	7055000	And he was really into it. And I was like, alright, I'll try this.
7055000	7061000	And then it's like, oh, I have to keep checking on these blueberries and shit every three hours and whatever.
7061000	7063000	Which is why I refuse to do the farming in WoW.
7063000	7067000	He really- I can talk about this now because, you know, he's a thing of the past.
7067000	7070000	But he really liked the Farmville song.
7070000	7076000	Which is so stupid because it's like the same five notes over and over again in different keys.
7076000	7082000	Like, I remember joking about having a 70 minute soundtrack to Farmville and it was just those same five notes over and over.
7088000	7092000	Lord. You know, I've never heard that. Why are you staring at me like that, Lowkey?
7092000	7095000	Because I've never heard of that song. You've never heard the Farmville song?
7095000	7097000	No. Neither have I.
7097000	7099000	I would like to not hear that song.
7101000	7107000	I'm sorry. You can't go all this time and then be all like, oh, I have never heard the song.
7107000	7110000	And then not expect somebody to not play the song.
7110000	7112000	I'm totally expecting an awesome song.
7112000	7114000	Oh, this is like-
7116000	7119000	Wait, that's like all different now. When did they modernize it?
7119000	7122000	It used to be just these little tones that would play over and over again.
7124000	7125000	Oh, forget it.
7125000	7127000	Yay!
7127000	7129000	That was fantastically non-generic at all.
7131000	7137000	Somebody must know the old Farmville songs. I know I'm not the only one that played Farmville back in the day.
7138000	7141000	Well, that's why I refuse to do the farming in WoW.
7141000	7143000	Not gonna do it. It's not happening.
7143000	7144000	Alright.
7144000	7146000	I don't give a damn about your scallions.
7147000	7153000	So Ubisoft, I guess they were ones to swear off DRM in their games or something like that.
7153000	7155000	Or they patched it out for the games that had it.
7155000	7158000	Well, they apparently didn't do that all the way.
7158000	7160000	Because Rocksmith just got released this week.
7160000	7168000	And the PC version missed having the codes to activate the game inside the box.
7170000	7171000	Oops.
7171000	7173000	Can't play the game. No activation code.
7175000	7177000	Of course, people are going, what the fuck?
7177000	7186000	So they went to Rocksmith forums and you have to go to a customer support site, fill out a form, attach a clear digital image of your receipt.
7187000	7189000	Showing the store details and the product.
7190000	7192000	And your credit card number, heh heh heh.
7192000	7202000	And, you know, I don't know. It's just, it's kind of stupid though that they have this problem in the first place.
7202000	7207000	That the serial wasn't part of, like, the game manual or something like that.
7207000	7209000	Wasn't printed somewhere in the game.
7209000	7215000	Oh, hey, you know, no one QA'd the fact that these games went out without codes in them.
7216000	7219000	Sounds like kind of a problem when your game just doesn't work.
7219000	7224000	Maybe you should patch out the authentication code then since you fucked up.
7224000	7226000	That might be a good way to do it, yep.
7226000	7232000	The problem with that is that you're putting the responsibility on the consumer and that's the wrong way to keep your fans.
7232000	7236000	I mean, I don't know how many people will be pirating that game anyways.
7236000	7239000	Because, I mean, you're talking about such a niche, niche niche niche thing.
7239000	7245000	You're talking about a game that requires an electric guitar, that requires a special connector.
7245000	7249000	So, even if you did pirate the game, you'd still have to go to the store to get that USB connector.
7249000	7253000	You know, to plug your guitar into your computer.
7255000	7259000	And, it's just, it's a PC title. It's not even the console title.
7259000	7263000	It's, that is, like, niche niche niche, you know.
7263000	7267000	I mean, yeah, people are gonna, some people probably will pirate it because they can.
7267000	7274000	But, dude, I mean, come on. I don't think that this is the type of game that necessarily needs that kind of DRM in there.
7274000	7277000	I don't know. It's just, it's a little ridiculous.
7277000	7282000	Yeah, especially when you make money in so many other ways with this game like this that has the peripherals and everything.
7282000	7287000	You know, it's just, it's, again, I think I'm with you. It's kind of useless to pirate this game.
7287000	7288000	It's probably.
7288000	7290000	To play it with the keyboard is ridiculous.
7290000	7291000	You can't.
7291000	7299000	Then there, well, don't ever tell a hacker they can't do something because you'll hack the, you can remap the keyboard or whatever.
7299000	7302000	But, still, it's pointless. It's absolutely pointless.
7302000	7308000	Yeah, you have to have a guitar. I mean, so, it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of ridiculous that they would even have that.
7308000	7312000	But, they did, and, of course, they said,
7312000	7319000	We apologize for the inconvenience caused and will provide any affected customers with the GuitarCade time saver,
7319000	7327000	which gives players instant access to all the Rocksmith minigames and Ubisoft, well, I guess it's one of the forum mods.
7327000	7335000	So, cool, you get free DLC to unlock shit in your PC game to make up for the fact that they fucked it up.
7335000	7343000	And, hey, Assassin's Creed 3 is right around the corner on, well, actually about a month away on PC, so, more fun.
7343000	7349000	Yeah, you know, if you're one of those people, you know, word of mouth is really gonna hurt them in this case and that's really unfortunate.
7349000	7353000	Well, at least this is the title they fucked up on in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry 3.
7353000	7361000	Still, you know, I think it's worse in this case. I think it's worse when it's a niche title like this that really is relied on word of mouth, I think, to gain popularity.
7361000	7369000	I mean, and you should be thanking these people left and right for buying your game on PC anyways, because, once again, this is such a niche game.
7369000	7376000	I don't see a lot of people on PC buying this game. I mean, it just doesn't seem like something that they would purchase.
7376000	7384000	I mean, I guess there's gonna be people that make music on their PC and stuff and maybe, but, you know, they wouldn't necessarily be wanting to learn guitar or something.
7384000	7387000	I don't know, it's just... it's weird.
7387000	7394000	And Ubisoft, come on! You would think that you would figure out this whole DRM thing. I mean, you've fucked this up before.
7394000	7404000	Driver, um, what was it? Driver vs San Francisco. Have you not learned? Apparently, the answer is yes, you have not learned.
7404000	7414000	Very unfortunate. Well, speaking of the continued adventures of Ubisoft, Ubisoft actually filed a $1 million lawsuit yesterday against BEP Music LLC.
7414000	7422000	Guess what BEP stands for? The Black Eyed Peas, the band. You know them? Boom Boom Pow, all that stuff.
7423000	7435000	They actually wrote a song that uses the days of the week as lyrics. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. And that is a top 40 song.
7435000	7440000	Well, if Friday can do it, we're gonna make our songs seven times better.
7440000	7449000	Anyhow, the Black Eyed Peas experience, I don't know if you know, but this was one of the dancing games that Ubisoft put out, and it was on the various consoles, probably PC as well.
7450000	7453000	Oh, it was just Wii and 360? They didn't even do it for PlayStation 3? Or PC? None of that?
7453000	7455000	No one gave a shit about PC.
7455000	7463000	Alright, well, whatever. Anyhow, it was supposed to happen on iOS, but apparently BEP breached the company's contract.
7463000	7470000	The contract stated that the band agreed to approve or disprove the iOS version within 10 business days of request.
7470000	7476000	However, the music company failed to acknowledge requests for approval despite repeated attempts.
7476000	7486000	Ubisoft claims they spent $233,000 developing the iOS game. That's how much it costs to develop a game like this, huh? I was just curious.
7486000	7493000	They think that combined with a loss of profits, this amounts to a total of $1 million in damages.
7493000	7505000	Ubisoft did not own the game or the company in question or whatever, but BEP only owns the Black Eyed Peas trademark, so you kinda have to put two and two together to figure out where this is.
7506000	7515000	So, uh, interesting. Maybe the band felt burned by the other games and didn't want to do it? Or maybe they just felt they were too good for it?
7515000	7520000	I don't think it was that bad. I mean, granted, this year we have the Hip Hop Dance Experience.
7520000	7524000	I think it is what it is, type of thing. So...
7524000	7533000	I mean, it didn't look like a terrible game, but I didn't play it. I saw video footage of it and it looked pretty interesting. I'm just not a fan of Black Eyed Peas, so...
7534000	7539000	So we are having livestream issues, by the way, for those folks that are listening live. It just reconnected.
7539000	7540000	It's comcastic.
7540000	7547000	I know. We were doing so well tonight, too, but again, if you guys have any extra stuff going, be sure it's killed.
7547000	7551000	Alright, um, let's move on to Dark Sakura.
7551000	7552000	To me?
7552000	7554000	Yeah, your story.
7554000	7560000	Oh, yeah, that. Um, how about some more Wii U stuff?
7561000	7568000	Square Enix game. There's going to be a Square Enix game that's done by the developer that's porting Mass Effect 3 to the Wii U.
7568000	7574000	It says it's a triple-A Square Enix port, but who knows what it is?
7574000	7581000	There's actually, um, it was actually listed on a LinkedIn page, which has since been, uh, changed.
7582000	7585000	So, who knows? But it will be a Squeenix game.
7585000	7586000	Tomb Raider.
7586000	7587000	Eh, probably.
7587000	7588000	Be my guess.
7588000	7591000	It's a, I don't care, because I'm not getting a Wii U.
7593000	7594000	You think so, huh?
7594000	7599000	I, well, I don't think Hitman's going to be coming out, because they'd be kind of late for it if they just started development on it.
7599000	7602000	So, Tomb Raider makes sense, because it's coming out about a year from now.
7602000	7605000	Well, they also mentioned a possibility of a Deus Ex.
7606000	7611000	Uh, once again, that would be really delayed. I mean, Deus Ex came out last year.
7611000	7614000	If Arkham Asylum, or if it's in Arkham City.
7614000	7620000	That's a cash-in on the beginning, but no one's going to want to play a game that came out three years ago that just has some different controls in it.
7620000	7626000	Well, Crystal Dynamics actually already denied Tomb Raider, saying that it would have to be completely redesigned.
7627000	7629000	So, it would be a much later released game.
7629000	7635000	It could still be, uh, Deadlion and Riptide, because I think they're publishing for, uh, that South Peak game.
7635000	7637000	Alright, ready for my tinfoil hat?
7638000	7642000	What about, I know this is going to be crazy talk, what about Final Fantasy XIV?
7643000	7644000	Uh...
7645000	7648000	Well, the new one could be good. We still don't know.
7648000	7650000	Yeah, monkeys could fly out of my butt.
7650000	7651000	I guess.
7651000	7653000	Anything's possible, right?
7653000	7658000	But once again, though, I mean, we're talking about a system that can't fucking handle Call of Duty Elite.
7658000	7660000	Or the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 redo.
7660000	7663000	If I start farting primates, then I'll believe it.
7664000	7665000	I don't know.
7666000	7671000	Once again, though, you were talking about a game that's probably going to be coming out next holiday.
7672000	7674000	It could be very well a title they haven't announced yet.
7674000	7675000	I mean, there's...
7676000	7678000	Let's see, I'm trying to think of...
7679000	7682000	I mean, they have Tomb Raider. There's other Square Enix titles.
7682000	7684000	It could be anything. Just use your imagination.
7684000	7686000	Chocobo Racing 2!
7686000	7687000	Yes!
7687000	7688000	Hey, that'd be awesome.
7688000	7689000	That would be awesome.
7689000	7691000	I might get a Wii U if there's Chocobo Racing.
7691000	7693000	Make it happen. Hell yeah.
7694000	7695000	Alright, let's move on.
7695000	7697000	Urgis 2? No.
7698000	7700000	Alright. Anyways, um...
7701000	7702000	So there was some...
7702000	7706000	You know, we talk a lot about Kickstarter, and there's always a conspiracy theory of...
7706000	7711000	Or not even conspiracy theory, but the reality that some of these projects may not turn out well.
7712000	7718000	So that kind of happened to be the case of one of the Kickstarter projects that actually did get funded.
7718000	7722000	It was a turn-based haunted house game called Haunts.
7722000	7726000	And it was being done by a company called Mob Rules Games.
7727000	7730000	And, you know, they raised...
7730000	7732000	I forget what it was. It was like...
7732000	7734000	Maybe $20,000?
7734000	7737000	And the problem is, though, that...
7737000	7740000	Now that it's been a few months or whatever...
7740000	7742000	All of his programmers quit.
7744000	7749000	And apparently all the money has been spent because, you know, $20,000 is not a whole lot.
7749000	7753000	But, at least it seems like kind of a null branch from the developer.
7753000	7755000	He says he's still going to continue working on the game.
7755000	7760000	And that if there's anybody that's seeking a refund, he will refund them out of his own pocket.
7760000	7762000	So that's kind of cool, at least.
7764000	7767000	And things happen, I guess, but at least he's still moving on.
7767000	7770000	Still has a lot of people jumping on here going,
7770000	7772000	Here's the dark side of Kickstarter!
7772000	7775000	Here's the problem with Kickstarter!
7775000	7776000	No, that's always...
7776000	7778000	They stole the money!
7778000	7780000	They didn't steal the money.
7780000	7783000	There have been a few people that just kind of, like, took the money and ran, but...
7783000	7787000	The majority of people, like, actually have a product that they want to put out and stuff.
7787000	7791000	And, you know, once again, you've just got to do your research.
7791000	7793000	That's the, you know...
7793000	7797000	Like, for example, that guy that wanted $1,000,000 for an MMO.
7797000	7802000	And, you know, had no idea of what...
7802000	7804000	Just, like, it was such a generic,
7804000	7807000	I want to make an MMO that's going to be bigger than WoW.
7807000	7811000	And it's got things and races and items.
7811000	7814000	And if you pledge this much, you're going to get a special item.
7814000	7815000	And I own a baseball...
7815000	7817000	Or, I used to play baseball, so I know I can do this.
7817000	7818000	Oh, wait. Sorry.
7818000	7819000	No, no.
7819000	7820000	Wrong case. Sorry.
7820000	7822000	But, no, you just have to do the research.
7822000	7824000	Like, obviously, Kickstarter stuff that, you know...
7824000	7829000	There's a lot of developers that have pedigrees in developing games and stuff like that.
7829000	7830000	They're putting stuff on Kickstarter.
7830000	7833000	You just have to, you know, be aware of what you're Kickstarting.
7833000	7835000	I mean, some of these companies, like the one I...
7835000	7837000	You know, like I said, the rhythm instruction game.
7837000	7840000	It's just like some people that, you know, some guys that are making a game.
7840000	7844000	And you don't know if that's going to be done, but they weren't asking for much money.
7844000	7847000	And, sure enough, they got the game out.
7847000	7849000	So, I mean, you can't just go,
7849000	7850000	Oh, they're all going to fail.
7850000	7852000	But just keeping that in mind, you know.
7852000	7855000	Remember, even if you do pledge money to Kickstarter,
7855000	7858000	you always have up until that close date to change your mind.
7858000	7860000	I've done that before with stuff, you know,
7860000	7862000	I was like, eh, I don't want to Kickstart this.
7862000	7863000	And you can take your money out.
7863000	7864000	You just pledge nothing.
7864000	7869000	So, that's that.
7869000	7872000	If you don't want to run the risk, then don't pledge.
7872000	7874000	Alright.
7874000	7878000	Well, moving on to one of my favorite people in gaming, Tetsuya Mizuguchi.
7878000	7882000	He's the former head of Q Entertainment.
7882000	7885000	So this kind of makes me sad that we're talking in past terms here.
7885000	7893000	Because he was the mind behind games like Rez, Luminous, Child of Eden, and Space Channel 5.
7894000	7897000	He has now taken a position at Keio University.
7897000	7899000	He's a project professor.
7899000	7902000	He will remain at Q as a spokesperson,
7902000	7905000	but it sounds like this is kind of his new path here now.
7905000	7908000	Keio did make an announcement about this
7908000	7911000	and noted that his position in the Graduate School of Media Design
7911000	7913000	will allow him to continue to produce games
7913000	7916000	and further expand his expertise in the field of media design
7916000	7918000	and innovative content production.
7918000	7921000	So it does appear he still will be working on games,
7921000	7923000	although there's only so many hours in a day, people,
7923000	7926000	but no longer in the commercial area.
7926000	7930000	So, yeah, I'll be interested to see what he comes up with next.
7930000	7933000	I'm glad at least he still has some ties to the gaming industry,
7933000	7935000	and I guess that's kind of cool that he can influence the future
7935000	7937000	because I think he's had a lot of great ideas.
7937000	7939000	I love the stuff he's done for music games.
7939000	7941000	Axidef does make a good point.
7941000	7943000	Mizuguchi Sensei.
7943000	7945000	That's what we have to call him from now on.
7945000	7947000	Good point, good point.
7947000	7950000	So, yeah, good luck to him in that new career.
7950000	7953000	At least, you know, as much as we might be sad that, you know,
7953000	7956000	he'll have less time for games, although they're staying,
7956000	7958000	he'll still do games.
7958000	7960000	It's in grading papers.
7960000	7962000	Yeah, he'll be influencing more people.
7962000	7963000	Oh, come on.
7963000	7965000	Noob, noob, noob, win.
7965000	7968000	If it's anything like it is here, the TAs grade all the papers.
7968000	7969000	You and I both know that.
7969000	7971000	All right.
7971000	7972000	Moving on.
7972000	7973000	You should eat all your popcorn.
7973000	7974000	Popcorn's good.
7974000	7975000	You should eat popcorn.
7975000	7976000	Let's get to the mailbag.
7976000	7978000	I'm eating yours.
7978000	7980000	Every week you guys send us e-mails.
7980000	7982000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
7982000	7984000	And we actually got some e-mails this week, right?
7984000	7985000	Kind of.
7985000	7986000	Woo.
7986000	7987000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
7987000	7989000	Darkstalker's going to dive into the mailbag head first
7989000	7990000	and pull out some e-mails.
7990000	7993000	She thinks, hey, I'm going to read this e-mail.
7993000	7998000	This one's long, so I'm going to read it first.
7998000	8001000	Dear OLR, I just wanted to chime in with my thoughts
8001000	8004000	in a recent game I completed, that game being Final Fantasy 13-2.
8004000	8007000	Originally, I played the demo when it was released on the PS3,
8007000	8009000	and I wasn't drawn into the game at all.
8009000	8012000	They didn't really explain anything that was going on story-wise,
8012000	8016000	and it seemed to make the game out to be a Final Fantasy filler.
8016000	8019000	Sorry, I've got corn.
8019000	8023000	I also read some reviews that spun the game in a negative light,
8023000	8026000	such as saying that the music in the game was terrible,
8026000	8029000	and that one reviewer in particular had to turn off the sound
8029000	8031000	for a final boss fight.
8031000	8034000	Boy, was I surprised when I picked up the game at Best Buy Summer Sale
8034000	8036000	and finally put it in my system.
8036000	8038000	The story turned out to be really interesting,
8038000	8040000	with time travel being an interesting mechanic
8040000	8043000	as a method to traveling to different areas.
8043000	8047000	Rob, if you haven't, you need to play this game to the end.
8047000	8050000	I haven't played to the end, but I've played a really good chunk of it,
8050000	8052000	and it is a good game.
8052000	8053000	I do need to beat it.
8053000	8055000	That brings me to a question for the host.
8055000	8059000	Have you ever played a game demo that you ended up not liking at all,
8059000	8062000	only to play the full game later on and absolutely love it?
8063000	8066000	Except I started hating it again, but I beat it.
8068000	8070000	I thought Parappa was kind of stupid at first,
8070000	8072000	and then I ended up loving it.
8074000	8077000	Well, in reverse, Nintendogs.
8077000	8079000	I loved the demo, and then the full game came out,
8079000	8081000	and I was like, that's it?
8081000	8082000	So I can only think of the reverse.
8082000	8086000	I can't think of where I've hated a demo and really loved the game.
8086000	8091000	I'd probably have to go back to the PS1 days to think of something.
8091000	8093000	I can't think of anything, because if I don't like the demo,
8093000	8095000	why am I going to buy the full game?
8096000	8097000	Halo.
8097000	8099000	The original Halo.
8099000	8101000	The first time I played it, I wasn't that into it.
8101000	8102000	I played it at a party.
8102000	8104000	I thought it was the best thing ever.
8104000	8108000	I don't know if that was really a demo, but that's the best answer I got.
8109000	8111000	Also, I've found that after hearing from multiple friends
8111000	8114000	of how much they dislike Final Fantasy 13,
8114000	8115000	yes, the first game,
8115000	8117000	then their impressions rub off on me,
8117000	8120000	making me skeptical if I would even like the sequel.
8121000	8123000	If I would have liked the sequel, sorry.
8123000	8126000	Thinking back on it, however, I really loved 13.
8126000	8128000	Yes, the battle system was exactly my favorite,
8128000	8131000	but it was far from enough to make the game not enjoyable.
8133000	8135000	Now for our final question.
8135000	8138000	Has a popular opinion about a game that you played
8138000	8140000	had an impact on how you felt about it,
8140000	8143000	or do you not let what people say affect your gaming experience?
8143000	8145000	I honestly try not to let what people say.
8146000	8149000	I try not to, but if I really dislike a game
8149000	8151000	and I go read that the popular opinion is very good,
8151000	8154000	I do kind of go, did I miss something?
8154000	8157000	Did I not understand something?
8157000	8159000	But that doesn't happen very often.
8160000	8161000	That's all I have to say for now.
8161000	8163000	Thanks for reading, Osprey.
8163000	8165000	I'm going to cry again.
8165000	8168000	P.S. It's really sad to hear about Jamie's dear cat, Shermie.
8168000	8170000	I'm sure she led an awesome life with her owners
8170000	8173000	and will be missed, rest in peace, hearts.
8173000	8176000	Yeah, she led an awesomely lazy life.
8176000	8178000	That's what a lot of listeners are thinking right now.
8179000	8181000	Yeah, I miss my baby.
8181000	8184000	Okay, this is from Taibon.
8184000	8186000	Taibon here, e-mailed you a few years ago,
8186000	8190000	and I thought I'd report back now what we're doing here in the heart of Africa.
8190000	8192000	My Xbox was red-ringed a while ago,
8192000	8195000	so it's been all PlayStation here at the household.
8195000	8197000	It's very hard finding new consoles here.
8197000	8200000	Oh, Borderlands and Skyrim marathons recently for me.
8200000	8201000	Hope you're all doing well.
8201000	8203000	Taibon, this message was brought to you by Dirt Garden,
8203000	8205000	home of the never-ending empty plates.
8205000	8208000	Did we do research the first time to see if this was a legit thing
8208000	8209000	or if it was a troll?
8209000	8211000	I think we found out, yeah, this guy's legit there.
8211000	8213000	Didn't he send a picture or something?
8213000	8214000	Yeah.
8214000	8216000	Well, thank you for checking in, sir.
8216000	8218000	Thanks for still listening even after.
8218000	8219000	Skeptical.
8219000	8221000	And every time I read your e-mail, I think of that song.
8221000	8224000	I remember the rains in Africa.
8224000	8225000	Toto.
8225000	8227000	Toto, thank you. I was like, what's that song? Yeah.
8229000	8231000	I've heard a really good cover of it at a concert.
8231000	8232000	Did you?
8232000	8235000	By a group, a men's acapella group called Straight No Chaser.
8238000	8239000	Is it something local?
8239000	8240000	No.
8240000	8242000	They're kind of the big thing.
8242000	8245000	They do tours and a lot of them were, I think,
8245000	8248000	Broadway performers and various singers and other things.
8248000	8251000	But actually look up the Straight No Chaser version
8251000	8253000	because it's really, really good.
8253000	8254000	Let's see.
8254000	8258000	I'm trying to, well, I want to just make sure our listener,
8259000	8260000	Oh, God.
8260000	8262000	I'm going to shake myself.
8262000	8264000	Ads are going to be the death of me.
8264000	8266000	It's terrible radio.
8266000	8272000	You would think one of these days I'm going to learn to load this stuff in advance.
8273000	8275000	And yes, I know all the lyrics to the song.
8275000	8276000	That's it.
8276000	8277000	You were right there.
8277000	8278000	Was it?
8278000	8279000	Yeah.
8279000	8280000	Right.
8280000	8281000	Oh, there it is. There it is. Here we go.
8281000	8282000	That's...
8293000	8295000	And yes, I know this one by its harmony.
8302000	8303000	Is that song in rock band?
8303000	8304000	No, but it should be.
8304000	8305000	It should be.
8305000	8307000	Dear Harmonics.
8309000	8310000	Last email.
8311000	8314000	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8314000	8315000	Turtle.
8315000	8317000	Here's an interesting dilemma I'm in.
8317000	8318000	Oh, no.
8318000	8319000	It's a dilemma.
8319000	8324000	I'm interested in a new PC game that's just come out on Steam, X-Com.
8324000	8327000	I like the demo, but I don't think it's worth 50 bucks.
8327000	8332000	So I can either get it by other means or wait for the Christmas sale or not get it at all.
8332000	8335000	My question is, if I wait for all PC games to go on sale on Steam,
8335000	8338000	will publishers stop making PC games because of the lack of release sales?
8338000	8342000	Or will they notice if people like me will wait for those games to go on sale?
8343000	8347000	I want to send the publishers a message that their games are too expensive,
8347000	8349000	but I still want to support the game makers.
8349000	8353000	And I don't want the lack of release sales to deter them from making the games to begin with.
8353000	8356000	What do you think, your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle?
8356000	8358000	Here's a reality check.
8358000	8362000	The game won't be $9.99 when the Christmas sale comes around.
8362000	8365000	The game will be like, what is it, 60 now?
8365000	8366000	It'll be like 30.
8366000	8367000	It'll be like 30.
8367000	8368000	Best 30 or 35.
8368000	8373000	And that's like best case scenario because I don't even think Skyrim went that low that fast.
8374000	8376000	So, you know, don't assume that the game...
8376000	8380000	Now, I certainly am not going to encourage you to go to more nefarious means
8380000	8384000	because then you certainly are sending the wrong message to the publisher.
8384000	8388000	And plus, if you do that, I don't think you'd get to do the online play and all that stuff,
8388000	8389000	which I think is supposed to be...
8389000	8392000	I used to love the old X-Com games.
8392000	8394000	I really need to look into this new one.
8394000	8396000	I've been playing all this other crap, so...
8396000	8398000	I think they're still going to make their money.
8398000	8399000	Yeah.
8399000	8404000	I think it's certainly better that you wait for the holiday sale than pirate it.
8404000	8406000	I mean, that's certainly the better of the two options.
8409000	8412000	Are you sending the wrong message by waiting?
8412000	8414000	I'm going to actually say not necessarily
8414000	8419000	because you're not the gamer that was like pre-ordering this,
8419000	8422000	eager about this the first day, had to have your hands on it right away.
8422000	8424000	There were other people that filled that niche for you.
8424000	8426000	You are on the fence.
8426000	8429000	And I think the company would rather have you at least kind of tilt over
8429000	8434000	and get the game eventually a little cheaper than not pay anything for it at all.
8434000	8437000	Dan Shadow in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
8437000	8439000	By the way, X-Com is addicting.
8439000	8442000	And TigerClaw says, The new X-Com is awesome.
8442000	8445000	Probably not helping you being able to resist buying it right now.
8445000	8447000	I know I'm really curious.
8447000	8449000	I kind of want to see if one of my friends has it
8449000	8450000	and go over to their house and watch them play
8450000	8452000	and then see if I want to get it.
8452000	8454000	We'll see.
8454000	8456000	There's a G100 mat in our chat at live.vognetwork.com
8456000	8460000	that warns it's hard from what I've been seeing.
8460000	8461000	There you go.
8461000	8463000	Any more emails tonight?
8463000	8464000	No.
8464000	8466000	Then let's get to the FUs of the week.
8466000	8468000	Because damn, y'all angry.
8481000	8489000	FU to Origin slash EA and or BioWare if BioWare is involved in this
8489000	8492000	for the patch that just came out for Mass Effect 3
8492000	8496000	that's not letting me and other people connect to the game
8496000	8499000	to actually play it and also not verifying my DLC
8499000	8502000	so I can't play the game that I paid money for.
8502000	8504000	Sue.
8504000	8505000	Oh, no.
8505000	8508000	I've already put the three magic words on EA's help forum.
8508000	8510000	Better Business Bureau.
8510000	8513000	I've gotten two responses already from other people in the community
8513000	8516000	so maybe it'll green light it, you know.
8519000	8521000	Heavy to my cold.
8521000	8524000	I'm all stuffed up.
8524000	8528000	What'd you get when you have a toddler in preschool?
8528000	8532000	Well, I don't have a toddler in preschool or whatever
8532000	8534000	but I do have a boyfriend and he's sick
8534000	8536000	so FU to the fact that he's sick.
8536000	8537000	Don't get me sick, anybody.
8537000	8540000	He can't help it but I'm just saying, you know,
8540000	8543000	I feel like dead man walking right now.
8543000	8546000	Like, I'm surrounded by, I know I'm gonna get sick.
8546000	8549000	I guess I'll have to try and enjoy the time off work
8549000	8551000	while I'm sitting here on the couch with the fever.
8551000	8553000	Yeah, lucky for you, you can take time off of work.
8553000	8556000	If I take time off of work, I probably have to watch Josh.
8556000	8558000	That's not really time off of work.
8558000	8561000	Well, and oh, here's the other perk.
8561000	8565000	Because, you know, I have a cold, I'm obviously snoring
8565000	8567000	because I have to breathe through my mouth and stuff
8567000	8568000	so I have to sleep on the couch.
8568000	8571000	I've been sleeping on the couch for the last two weeks.
8571000	8574000	And that means I also have to tend to the baby all night long
8574000	8576000	when he loses his bink and cries.
8576000	8579000	So I'm up about once every hour.
8579000	8582000	Don't worry, in a few more years, he'll be able to take care of himself.
8582000	8584000	It's all good. Well, he can take care of himself now.
8584000	8587000	He's just too tired to find his bink that's right next to his head.
8587000	8590000	And he's like, I want my bink, it's under my head.
8590000	8593000	I'm like, why don't you get it yourself?
8593000	8596000	Tigerclaw in our chat room is reporting that the Mass Effect 3 data pad
8596000	8597000	hasn't been working for weeks.
8597000	8598000	Mine's worked.
8598000	8599000	Really?
8599000	8600000	I'm at 100% right now.
8600000	8602000	Well, then there you go.
8602000	8604000	It's just you, Tigerclaw.
8604000	8606000	Uninstall, reinstall.
8606000	8610000	That's actually what I did is I uninstalled, reinstalled Mass Effect 3
8610000	8612000	and tried to play it.
8612000	8616000	And what happened is that it gave me the same error before
8616000	8622000	so I went on offline mode and it let me go into the single player game
8622000	8625000	and then I later on was able to get into multiplayer,
8625000	8630000	but it since hasn't allowed me to do any of it again.
8630000	8635000	Tigerclaw in chat says, I've been playing XCOM on my Twitch TV recently.
8635000	8637000	That's one of those things I'm surprised I'm not into right now
8637000	8638000	is streaming video games.
8638000	8639000	I think I'd have fun.
8639000	8642000	Wouldn't you guys like to see me play Mass Effect 3 online?
8642000	8644000	Wouldn't that be fun?
8644000	8648000	Yeah, Tigerclaw saying the galaxy at war won't load.
8648000	8649000	Oh.
8650000	8652000	Yeah, it's actually...
8653000	8656000	It was saying that it wasn't for me to still let me play everything,
8656000	8660000	but now it's actually saying cannot log into servers or whatever.
8662000	8663000	Yeah, I'm...
8663000	8665000	If you can hear it, I'm actually in the thing right now.
8665000	8666000	There you go.
8667000	8669000	All right, let's move on.
8669000	8672000	A couple more news stories for you guys and then a Skype line and Twitter topic.
8674000	8675000	All right.
8676000	8678000	So, let's talk about Minecraft.
8678000	8682000	Minecraft's got a pretty awesome update coming out next week.
8682000	8683000	1.4.
8683000	8685000	That's a pretty scary update.
8685000	8687000	And, of course, it's sort of Halloween themed.
8687000	8690000	They did one a couple years ago that was also Halloween themed.
8690000	8693000	And they're adding a lot of cool shit into the game.
8693000	8697000	So, first, let's talk a little bit about what they're adding.
8697000	8700000	One of the things I'm very excited about is command blocks.
8700000	8706000	And what the command blocks allow you to do is actually issue some of the commands
8706000	8709000	from the admin panel in game.
8709000	8715000	So, you can have a block set up, for example, to have a certain area set to peaceful.
8715000	8718000	So, no mob spawn in a certain radius or something like that.
8718000	8724000	Or you can have a command block that's set up to spawn a person to a certain coordinate,
8724000	8726000	which I'll be using for sure.
8726000	8732000	Or a command block to set the weather or to do all sorts of different things.
8732000	8734000	You can actually have mobs spawn.
8734000	8738000	I think they actually have it where you can create mob spawners now too.
8738000	8741000	They're updating all the different sounds in the game.
8741000	8746000	They're adding sounds for placing different blocks, for walking on those blocks,
8746000	8751000	sounds for the enemies, all sorts of cool stuff like that.
8751000	8753000	Portals are changing a little bit.
8753000	8757000	The Nether portals in creative mode, you're going to be able to instantly go through them.
8757000	8760000	Adventure mode, they're allowing you to break blocks now.
8760000	8762000	And you can also place blocks.
8762000	8764000	They're changing how they're doing the breeding stuff.
8764000	8772000	They're adding different characters into the game, including bats, witches, and...
8772000	8781000	What was it? It was the wither and wither skeletons.
8781000	8786000	Also, they're having some changes to iron golems and stuff.
8786000	8789000	Now they're going to attack other characters.
8789000	8793000	Creepers, once again, you can actually create them with mob spawners
8793000	8795000	that you can now put down in the game.
8795000	8800000	And you can toggle how long it takes for them to explode and their explosion radius,
8800000	8801000	which is pretty cool.
8801000	8805000	And then new blocks, they've got, besides those command blocks, beacons,
8805000	8810000	which will create that Luxor pyramid beam into the sky thing,
8810000	8812000	as it can give you different buffs.
8812000	8816000	Anvils to repair armor and tools.
8816000	8818000	The mob spawners, as I mentioned.
8818000	8824000	Flower pots, so you can put saplings and mushrooms and whatever in little pots.
8824000	8827000	Cobblestone walls, wooden logs are going to change how you can place those.
8827000	8831000	Stairs are going to go around corners now, which is kind of cool.
8831000	8836000	Item frames, so you can make little frames of your maps and clocks and stuff like that.
8836000	8839000	Heads, you can put a human head in the wall.
8839000	8842000	They're also making some changes to trapdoors.
8842000	8845000	They're adding wooden buttons that you can activate with arrows.
8846000	8849000	And potatoes, carrots, carrots on a stick for riding pigs.
8849000	8852000	You can ride pigs and control where they go now.
8852000	8853000	Awesome.
8853000	8855000	So we're going to have, I'm going to set up a pig cart racing track.
8855000	8856000	That'll be pretty awesome.
8856000	8857000	God.
8858000	8862000	Different potions, including night vision and invisibility potions.
8862000	8867000	Maps, now you can spawn them, or you can craft them so they zoom out
8867000	8869000	and create larger maps.
8869000	8872000	And leather armor can be dyed, so you can wear pink armor if you want to.
8873000	8878000	And of course the new villain or boss character in the game, the wither,
8878000	8883000	can be spawned too, although I'm kind of scared to spawn that
8883000	8888000	because you can actually create it with soul sand and wither skeleton skulls,
8888000	8890000	but he will attack mobs and players.
8890000	8896000	And he's got explosive heads that will actually blow up everything, including obsidian.
8897000	8898000	Oh boy.
8898000	8900000	So, I'll have to make a rule.
8900000	8901000	No spawning the wither.
8902000	8906000	I just sort of blanked out and had no idea what he was talking about.
8906000	8908000	It's like when you talk about Mass Effect.
8908000	8910000	You know what I'm talking about.
8910000	8911000	I at least hear you.
8911000	8912000	Well, bats are going to be cool.
8912000	8913000	I mean, those will...
8914000	8915000	It sounds interesting.
8915000	8917000	I've been slacking on a Minecraft thing, I have.
8917000	8919000	There's only so many hours in the day, people.
8919000	8921000	Remember folks, you can come to the Minecraft server.
8921000	8925000	We got, I'm usually on with one or two people.
8925000	8928000	Usually it's just me, for hours at a time.
8928000	8931000	I made a giant fucking roller coaster the other day.
8931000	8932000	Nice.
8932000	8933000	It's really big.
8933000	8934000	I want to ride it.
8934000	8935000	It's got lots of jumps on it.
8935000	8936000	Alright.
8936000	8937000	And, yeah.
8937000	8938000	Very cool.
8938000	8940000	Alright, well, one more story for you guys tonight,
8940000	8942000	and this is a bit of a sad thing.
8943000	8946000	We did lose somebody in the gaming industry this week,
8946000	8950000	and it was a UK-based individual, Mike Singleton,
8950000	8953000	who unfortunately passed away this week at the age of 61.
8953000	8954000	He died of natural causes,
8954000	8957000	and this was after a year-long battle with jaw cancer.
8957000	8959000	You may not know the name,
8959000	8961000	but you might know some of his contributions,
8961000	8963000	including Space Ace on the Commodore VIC-20.
8963000	8966000	I don't think that's to be confused with the arcade title.
8966000	8969000	War and Middle Earth for the ZX Spectrum.
8969000	8972000	Midwinter and Midwinter 2 for the Atari ST, Amiga, and PC.
8972000	8974000	One of the most recent things he was involved with.
8974000	8978000	Grid for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
8978000	8981000	So Mike Singleton, again, passed away at 61.
8981000	8984000	Please, a tip of the glass here.
8984000	8987000	A toast to absent friends.
8987000	8990000	Alright, let's get to Twitter.
8990000	8992000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8992000	8994000	And the Skype line is now open.
8994000	8996000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8996000	8999000	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8999000	9002000	If you want to give us a call, again, the Skype line's open.
9002000	9004000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9004000	9006000	Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9006000	9008000	I need to go grab the iPad.
9008000	9011000	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9011000	9013000	Just some small stuff.
9013000	9020000	They were talking about having a change to the Xbox Live, I guess, service.
9020000	9025000	They're going to do Xbox Live migration to anyone, I guess.
9025000	9027000	And it's going to be automated soon.
9027000	9034000	And what migration means is that if, for example, I'm in North America and I move to Europe,
9034000	9041000	you can change your account so that it will show the European marketplace.
9041000	9044000	Which would be completely useless if you brought your system.
9044000	9048000	But for whatever reason, if you want to change regions or something like that, then you can do that.
9048000	9050000	But they're going to allow you to do that.
9050000	9052000	Let me quickly go to the phones because we do have a call.
9052000	9054000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9054000	9055000	It's Shane.
9055000	9057000	Shane. What's up, Shane?
9057000	9059000	There are two things I would like to talk about tonight.
9059000	9061000	Number one.
9062000	9065000	Silent Hill Book of Memories is a piece of garbage.
9065000	9069000	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You probably would have used another word, but I know you don't swear.
9069000	9073000	Well, it's also a piece of crap or a piece of...
9073000	9075000	Well, I've already used two words, so it's fine.
9075000	9078000	Why is it so terrible? You're like the biggest Silent Hill fan I know.
9078000	9081000	Not lately because they've all been crap games.
9081000	9086000	In fact, this weekend I watched Downpour because I haven't played it yet and that was pretty crap too.
9087000	9093000	My boyfriend picked up the main game and I forced him to return it because I've heard bad things.
9093000	9101000	So then I downloaded the demo, which is not always indicative of the quality of the game, but from what I understand, the demo is really close.
9101000	9108000	And it ruins everything that I like about Silent Hill.
9108000	9121000	It's a dungeon crawler with breakable weapons, mixed up characters, and it's got a store for goodness sakes that you visit to buy things.
9121000	9124000	Get your Diablo out of my Silent Hill.
9124000	9127000	Yeah, and I hate Diablo, so it makes it worse.
9127000	9136000	But the thing that got me right away was in the tutorial, besides making your character, which I usually love, because making characters I can spend hours on,
9136000	9144000	you enter the Silent Hill world. The very first monster you see is Valtiel and he gives you missions.
9144000	9147000	His first mission? Visit the store.
9147000	9151000	That's not something Valtiel would ask me to do.
9151000	9154000	For one thing, he doesn't have a mouth. He'd just be shaking his head at me.
9154000	9158000	And secondly, I'd probably be dead.
9158000	9160000	Wow.
9160000	9164000	Yeah, it is a negative 1200.
9164000	9166000	Silent Hill has jumped the shark.
9166000	9171000	Yes, and I expected better from this company because they did the ports of Contra.
9171000	9180000	Well, not ports, but they did Contra 4 and A Boy and His Blob, the remake. So, I don't know, very disappointed.
9180000	9187000	Let's see, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, quote, I hate Silent Hill. It's not Mass Effect. Shane, back of the box.
9187000	9193000	No, that is not true. I like other things that are not Mass Effect, just not as much.
9194000	9197000	All right, what's the number two thing you want to talk about tonight?
9197000	9201000	Um, crap, what was it? Oh, Mass Effect.
9201000	9203000	Of course, of course.
9203000	9209000	I am greatly disheartened at the fact that they have confirmed no Shepard for the next game.
9209000	9216000	And they also are saying that it's not going to be like another Shepard type character.
9216000	9223000	Which leads me to think that it may not even be the same style of gameplay, which I'm very, very, very worried about.
9223000	9225000	It should be the saga of Garrus.
9225000	9227000	It's going to be a dancing game.
9227000	9230000	I'm very pissed off at them, Shane.
9230000	9232000	I hope it's the Volus dancing game.
9232000	9234000	It's going to be Space Channel 5.
9234000	9236000	It's going to be Volus bowling.
9236000	9240000	Okay, look, here's the deal. It's because it's probably a next gen game.
9240000	9247000	The Mass Effect 4 is going to be on the new consoles, and so that's why I think they're putting the past behind, and they're going to go this different direction.
9247000	9250000	I don't think that means you're going to get this drastically different gameplay.
9250000	9255000	It's just, you know, whatever the niche is about these new consoles, Mass Effect's probably worked it in somehow.
9255000	9262000	I'm just worried that it'll be like an RTS or something that I hate, or a sports game, or a strategy game.
9262000	9269000	I think it's just going to be very similar, but, you know, it might handle a little differently, it might play a little differently.
9269000	9273000	Just don't expect the same interface and all that stuff you see in the first one.
9273000	9275000	I think it'll be alright. Give it a chance.
9275000	9277000	I'll give it a chance.
9277000	9280000	Bioware made Mass Effect 1 after all, and 2, and 3.
9280000	9282000	Shane, yell at them for me.
9282000	9284000	Yell at who?
9284000	9288000	Anyone who's involved with my Mass Effect not connecting.
9288000	9290000	I don't know who to yell at for that.
9290000	9294000	She's been trying to play. Funny enough, I know somebody she could yell at.
9294000	9297000	There you go. Rob is your answer.
9297000	9302000	But, um, yeah. You might know this person, actually.
9302000	9303000	Really?
9303000	9306000	I'll tell you off air. I better not. Can't tell you here.
9306000	9308000	But, um, yeah.
9308000	9310000	I need my Garris fix.
9310000	9314000	Jamie's not able to play multiplayer with us, instead. I played some multiplayer.
9314000	9316000	I can't even play single player.
9316000	9318000	We have more achievement points than Alan. How does that work?
9318000	9322000	Or, not achievement points, but challenge points, whatever that new thing is.
9322000	9324000	I do not know.
9324000	9327000	BlackWolf is trolling in our chat room saying,
9327000	9331000	A Mass Effect with the writing team of Borderlands and Portal. Want.
9331000	9336000	So, not as good as previous Mass Effect games?
9336000	9340000	No, that just means that they'll throw in a lot of dirty humor.
9340000	9343000	I don't want that. I like the seriousness.
9343000	9345000	Technus Reality Check says,
9345000	9348000	Unfortunately, BioWare has to finish Dragon Age 3 first.
9348000	9350000	Yeah, no one cares.
9350000	9358000	You know, I care. I like Dragon Age. I didn't like 2, but I'm actually thinking about giving it another shot on some system that I own it on.
9358000	9363000	I don't know which one I'm going to play it on, but I got excited for the information that leaked out.
9363000	9367000	Or, not leaked out, but that came out about Mass Effect Dragon Age 3.
9367000	9369000	But there's no Garris.
9369000	9370000	There's no what?
9370000	9371000	Garris.
9371000	9375000	I'm not all about Garris like you, so there's no Kayden for me.
9375000	9377000	There's no Kayden.
9377000	9378000	That's true.
9378000	9380000	There are the little weepy emo elf boys.
9380000	9383000	I played one of those in the first game.
9383000	9386000	He was awesome. He wasn't sad.
9386000	9389000	Alright, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Shane?
9389000	9391000	No. Not at all.
9391000	9394000	Well, apparently you broke our stream anyway, so thanks for that.
9394000	9396000	Good. I'm proud of that.
9396000	9398000	Alright, then I'm hanging up on you. Bye.
9398000	9400000	Alright. 1877 Game OLR.
9400000	9402000	Who am I talking to right now?
9402000	9405000	Nobody, because the stream's not connected apparently.
9405000	9407000	Alright.
9407000	9412000	Well, it did just reconnect, so hopefully some people will hear this and know that the Skype line is open again.
9412000	9414000	1877 Game OLR.
9414000	9416000	Did I say that right? 1877 Game OLR.
9416000	9418000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9418000	9425000	Did we ever figure out if it was the host thing because obviously our internet here is not having issues?
9425000	9427000	Yeah, it's not our internet here.
9427000	9429000	It is either...
9429000	9435000	Well, I don't even think it's our connection getting to the server because wouldn't that mean our IRC should go down?
9435000	9437000	Our internet would stop working.
9437000	9440000	You'd get booted from Mass Effect or whatever you're doing in there.
9440000	9442000	Like, all that should happen too, right?
9442000	9448000	That individual connection from, sorry, 3 to 2 to the thing in New Jersey.
9448000	9450000	Hmm. Maybe. I don't know. Alright.
9450000	9452000	I blame New Jersey.
9452000	9453000	Alright.
9453000	9454000	The entire state.
9454000	9456000	Let's try to go...
9456000	9462000	I think maybe other things don't get disrupted by little internet hiccups.
9462000	9466000	But the feed will just shut down if that happens.
9466000	9468000	I don't know. Anyhow.
9468000	9472000	Let's move on. 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9472000	9474000	Loki, did you have any last minute stories for us?
9474000	9476000	Because I got some tweets I can do here.
9476000	9478000	No, I don't have any.
9478000	9482000	Let me go to a tweet from ActDeft that says,
9482000	9485000	Oh, the Wii U's first commercial from Europe.
9485000	9487000	I didn't know the Wii U.
9487000	9489000	That's actually the commercial. Don't worry.
9489000	9495000	At last, a brand new console with a brand new controller that redefines how you interact with games.
9495000	9497000	So what is Wii U?
9497000	9500000	Shoot at the TV like never before.
9500000	9502000	Sping, sping, sping, sping, sping, sping!
9502000	9503000	Nice shooting.
9503000	9506000	And say someone wants to watch TV when you're halfway through a game.
9506000	9508000	I want to watch the TV now.
9508000	9510000	Do both and everyone's happy.
9512000	9518000	See a different perspective with the gamepad and get closer to your target for a more precise shot.
9518000	9519000	Nice.
9519000	9521000	Is this a real commercial?
9521000	9525000	It's a real commercial. It's in Europe, but I wanted to point out something that I read.
9525000	9531000	Do notice when they say play games that you've never seen before or something like that,
9531000	9533000	and they show Batman Arkham City.
9534000	9537000	The Skype line is ringing off the hook, so I need to get one of these calls.
9537000	9539000	Hi, you're on Orange Islands Radio. Who's this?
9539000	9540000	Hi, can you guys hear me?
9540000	9543000	Ooh, you're very, very quiet. Turn it up a little bit.
9543000	9546000	I'll try. It's just stupid skies being a pain.
9546000	9549000	Yeah, we can barely hear you. The listeners probably can't hear you either.
9549000	9551000	How about now?
9551000	9553000	Nope, you're still quiet.
9553000	9555000	We have one more go.
9555000	9557000	Crank it up.
9557000	9561000	May I have to shout it in this case?
9561000	9564000	We can hear you a little bit. Go ahead. What's up? Who is this?
9564000	9566000	First up, this is DDR Dollar Bill.
9566000	9568000	Hey, DDR Dollar Bill. What's on your mind?
9568000	9575000	Hey, not much. You guys mentioned earlier about you gave a shout-out to those who participated in the Extra Life marathon.
9575000	9576000	Yes.
9576000	9578000	Yeah, I took part in that too for the first time.
9578000	9581000	Congratulations. How'd you do?
9581000	9587000	I lasted for quite a while, but I dozed off at around six-something.
9587000	9589000	That's all right.
9589000	9593000	Yeah, but it taught me something very interesting.
9593000	9604000	First off, me and my coworker at work actually managed to raise a decent amount of money in two days because we just got the okay from our job to take part in this.
9604000	9605000	Nice.
9605000	9616000	And second off, it is so hard to do 24 hours of gaming on some games because some games just bored the hell out of me after an hour.
9616000	9625000	How did you do it? Did you try to do one game for the whole 24 hours, or were you like, okay, every hour we're going to switch? How did you do that?
9625000	9633000	I switched it up about every one hour or two hours, depending on the game and how I was feeling when playing it.
9633000	9637000	I got you. So what kind of stuff did you play?
9638000	9653000	Let's see. I haven't re-bought a new game in a while because I'm waiting on a new computer to ship in, so it was mostly stuff that I had to catch up with in my queue, which is quite a lot, but quite old.
9653000	9664000	I was catching up in Arkham Asylum, for example, then there was Red Dead Redemption, things like ModNation Racers, and even Infamous.
9664000	9671000	And then I went to the 360 where I caught up with some Rock Band 3 and things like Virtua Fighter 5.
9671000	9673000	So a lot of modern stuff, but that's good.
9674000	9684000	And were you live streaming this all to Ustream or Twitch or whatever one of those sites, or were you just kind of doing this at home and trying to get people to sponsor you doing that at home?
9684000	9694000	Mostly through Facebook, and I just stayed at home. I didn't really do any streaming or tweeting because, like I said, it was my first time, so I wasn't exactly sure what to do.
9694000	9701000	Sure. Hey, you know what? And even raising $1 is a great effort for the cause, so congrats to you.
9701000	9709000	Let me ask you, though, how did you go about raising the money? Did you just spam a lot on Facebook, or what was your strategy to get people to care?
9710000	9720000	I just posted. I had two days to get the money, so I just said, alright, I'm just going to post on Facebook, and whoever gives, whoever gives, you know, wasn't going to be picky.
9720000	9727000	I'm just like, hey, just whatever you can spare. I don't care if it's $1 or $2 or $12, just whatever you can spare.
9727000	9729000	And some of my coworkers gave money.
9729000	9734000	Nice. Well, assuming you're doing it all again next year, what are some things you're going to do differently?
9734000	9746000	Get the okay about a month in advance, and then start doing a fundraising there and asking everybody I can think of, and I also would like to see you guys participate as well.
9746000	9755000	You know, it's kind of hard when one of us has a baby, you know, to do the 24-hour straight, but we definitely want to get involved in the charity effort.
9755000	9762000	I mean, you know, last year, Dark Soccer and I both did a lot with UmLoud, and we're going to do whatever we can to help this year as well.
9762000	9775000	That's something that we're really passionate about. We do want to try to do our own thing outside of the holidays, just because the holiday is a very crowded time for charity, but, you know, charity needs TLC 24 or 7, 365.
9775000	9784000	So we do want to do something at some point. We think especially with the VOG Network behind us, you know, get Bobby and Critical Myth and some of the other shows in on it.
9784000	9797000	Try to do some type of, and maybe not necessarily just games, we have to really think about this, but some type of nerding out for charity, and we've got to really put the borders on that, but I think there's an idea in there somewhere.
9797000	9805000	Ah, I see. That's a good idea, actually. Hell, I don't think anybody would say no to geeking out for charity.
9805000	9810000	Exactly. We just have to figure out exactly how to do it, so we'll see what we can do.
9811000	9819000	I just have one more quick question. What is it about World of Warcraft that keeps you guys playing? I just want to know that.
9819000	9820000	Pandas.
9820000	9830000	The other people that play, and just, you know, having the community, and I'm not necessarily just talking strangers, but like friends or people that have become my friends through the game.
9830000	9835000	Just, you know, being able to log in and say, hey, it's a chat room with fireballs and swords.
9835000	9837000	I like that.
9837000	9840000	That's exactly it. Alright, well take care, buddy. Have a good one.
9840000	9841000	You too, thanks.
9841000	9843000	Thanks for the call, and thanks for doing Extra Life. That's great.
9843000	9844000	Hey, any time.
9844000	9845000	Alright, take care.
9846000	9856000	Yeah, we do need to get in on more stuff like that. We do. But, you know, there's a lot of charity events. We can't do them all, but we'll plug wherever we can, absolutely.
9856000	9864000	1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. I'm falling way behind on some of these Twitter stories, so let me get to some other ones of these here.
9865000	9875000	Tigerclaw sends a few over here. One saying, UK man faces jail time for selling counterfeit Nintendo games. Oh, I'd read about this previously.
9875000	9881000	A 41-year-old Justin Success Brooks. Well, not living up to his middle name right now.
9881000	9887000	Apparently, he did fraudulent sale of counterfeit Nintendo games. This is all allegedly.
9887000	9895000	According to the Cryodin Guardian, he was caught in an investigation conducted by Nintendo and then the UK Interactive Entertainment Association.
9895000	9905000	He trafficked illegal Nintendo goods from 2009 and 2011. He made almost a million dollars in U.S. dollars. It was about 600,000 pounds.
9905000	9915000	Selling counterfeit Wii DS and DSi games. He was charged with seven counts of fraud, two counts of fraudulent trading, two counts of supplying an article to use in a fraud,
9915000	9921000	two counts of unauthorized possession of goods bearing a trademark, and one count of unauthorized use of the trademark is what that all boils down to.
9921000	9930000	He did plead guilty to all counts. He's awaiting sentencing. Boy, oh boy. Alright, let's do one more call.
9930000	9932000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9933000	9935000	Hey, this is Raginator.
9935000	9938000	Hey, what's up, Raginator? Haven't heard from you in a while.
9938000	9947000	Yeah, I know. It's kind of a long story. I kind of posted on what's been going on on the blog forums, so I won't rehash that.
9947000	9949000	Fair enough. Well, what's up? What's on your mind?
9949000	9961000	Well, I, God forbid, I actually got my first PC game, you know, last weekend. It's kind of an older title, but definitely good one. I think you guys would approve the Apple II.
9961000	9971000	That is a classic. That is a classic. And in fact, you should just keep playing that one and pretend it's three, because then you'll be more satisfied.
9971000	9975000	Oh, I'm trolling. I'm trolling. Making the Diablo III fans mad.
9975000	9984000	Honestly, you know, truth be told, you know, I've seen that I don't have access to a PlayStation 3 for the time being. I need something to play.
9984000	9992000	I was sure that Diablo II would run out of my machine, so they have the store. I can't figure what the heck to pick it up.
9992000	10000000	So, you're playing the classics right now. What made you choose Diablo II out of all the games you could have picked out there?
10000000	10015000	Well, I wanted to get a game legally as opposed to some kind of torrent. Some torrents were out. And some of the edutainment titles they would give for kids definitely don't appeal to me.
10015000	10029000	And I'm pretty sure that even though my new computer is a little bit more high-tech than my old computer that was stolen, you know, games like Grand Theft Auto and whatnot probably won't run on my computer.
10029000	10035000	So, I can't figure. Alright, Diablo II is what? Ten years old?
10035000	10039000	It might even be older than that, actually. But yeah, it's old. Very old.
10039000	10054000	Yeah, and plus, you know, I played Diablo I, or at least a PlayStation 1 port of Diablo I on my, you know, PlayStation 1 way back when. I knew I liked the PlayStation 1 port of the original game, so I can't figure.
10054000	10061000	Eh, might as well go with it. Plus, it was $20 for the base gaming and the one expansion pack, so.
10061000	10067000	Okay, so some of our chatters are asking about this, so I have to ask you about it because I keep hearing it too. Do you have a smoke alarm dying in the background?
10067000	10074000	Uh, basically, yes. I need to, you know, put the new battery in.
10074000	10081000	Don't set fire to your house with it because when it's crying out for a low battery, just be careful. Oh my god, how do you sleep with that going?
10081000	10085000	Uh, well, I learned to tune it out, actually, so.
10085000	10103000	Honestly, get up, take that thing down, take the battery out. Not that I should be encouraging you to do that, but get a good night's sleep, for god's sake. Take the battery out of that sucker and make it a priority in the next couple days to replace that before your place burns down, which I hope it doesn't, but you always want to be prepared.
10104000	10111000	Yeah, well, and I don't do, you know, I don't engage in any kind of dangerous activities in my place, but I never know with my neighbors.
10111000	10120000	That's right, your neighbors might be smoking marijuana and you don't even know. Alright, look, the thing I really wanted to tell you about was, you should check out this website.
10120000	10140000	If you're interested in getting games legally, especially old stuff that will play on your computer and, you know, safe, I would look into a website called GOG.com, and that's G-O-G.com, it's Good Old Games, and they sell tons of old stuff, and a lot of it goes for like five bucks, seven bucks, and there's some really good stuff in there.
10140000	10161000	In fact, they're trying to cash in on the indie bundle craze right now, not that it's really an indie bundle per se, but they have like an interplay bundle going on right now, where for like 35 bucks you can get like 50 games, and there's some classics in there, like Descent, and Castles, which is a game I used to play. It's a great website, and I have to recommend it.
10162000	10177000	Another game that I probably should probably get back into is World of Warcraft, if only because I did download the clients on my computer and tried to play it, although the framing was extremely choppy.
10177000	10184000	Well, you can say goodbye to your life if you get back into World of Warcraft. No, but well, the graphics have come a long way.
10184000	10191000	It's a higher, more powerful game, and I think it will be a little bit better.
10198000	10200000	Sure, that's good. Have a good one.
10214000	10222000	I guess I had to end the call, but let's all hope that Raginear gets the battery replaced in Smoke Detector soon.
10222000	10227000	Alright, moving on. I need to do the rest of these Twitter topics, because there's still like a bunch of these here.
10227000	10237000	So I did the one about Tigerclaw on the counterfeit time. Let me read one other tweet from Tigerclaw. He sent a couple others. Usually I do a two tweet max, but these are both pretty good.
10237000	10249000	This is about the Zynga lawsuit that was settled. Zynga sued the makers of Pyramidville because they used the word Ville.
10249000	10257000	Cobo Joe was the name of the company. They actually settled, and Pyramidville is now Pyramid Valley, so I can't believe it. They caved.
10257000	10260000	Oh well. Poor guys.
10260000	10269000	Alright, here's the other one from Tigerclaw that I think is definitely worth reporting on here. Apparently there's a Steam vulnerability that can lead to a remote insertion of malicious code.
10269000	10276000	Now don't panic, for God's sake, but you know when Steam gets a hole poked in and a lot of people are going to be talking about it.
10276000	10279000	So apparently there's a vulnerability in the Steam browser.
10279000	10282000	Does Steam come out when you poke a hole in it?
10283000	10292000	But it's the Steam browser protocol. When you use, instead of like HTTP to go to a website, you use Steam colon slash slash to go to a website.
10292000	10306000	If you can get a user to click on a link for a specially formed Steam URL, an attacker can remotely exploit buffer overflow bugs and other vulnerabilities in Steam games and Steam itself to get malicious code on a target's machine.
10306000	10315000	So please be careful what you click on, but knowing Valve, this shit is probably already patched. We're going to be on it very soon.
10315000	10317000	So, there you go.
10317000	10325000	Also, Dark Tetsuya wants to remind you guys, and I'm so sorry I forgot. I think this is really cute, these little fan games and so forth that are made.
10325000	10332000	Dark Tetsuya finished his President Cat Pong, which he made in the games factory, and sure enough it's a little President Cat.
10332000	10338000	You know we love President Cat that bounces back and forth on these barber poles? Whatever, it works out.
10338000	10340000	So, very cute. Love it.
10340000	10346000	It is available for download. The only place you're going to find it is on the forums at vognetwork.com slash forums.
10346000	10352000	Check the Orange Lounge Radio Forum for the President Cat Pong download. Good job, Dark Tetsuya.
10353000	10361000	ActDeft tweets about Forza Horizon's Rally Expansion and StreetPass? Oh, SeasonPass, excuse me.
10361000	10374000	Forza Horizon, of course, is launching on October 23rd. Apparently, what's happening with this, for 1600 Microsoft points, you can get the Forza Horizon Rally Expansion pack.
10374000	10385000	It is included with the SeasonPass, however, and I guess you get an off-road racing experience with deeper ruts, higher jumps, and new surface types to explore.
10385000	10392000	It's an add-on pack for Forza. What else do you need to know? Look at them shiny cars. Look at them shiny, pretty cars.
10392000	10396000	I am terrible at Forza, just for the record.
10396000	10404000	SDG100Matt sent that same link about Skyrim at Rice University. Bummer, we already talked about that. Fushuda!
10404000	10410000	That's it for Twitter Topics. How about, um, Loki, did you have anything else you wanted to throw out there?
10410000	10413000	No. I have nothing.
10413000	10418000	Ooh, this is a big one. Bobby's linking this in chat right now.
10419000	10432000	From the official PlayStation blog, a new system software update for PlayStation 3, 4.3, will make changes to how trophies are displayed on your PlayStation 3.
10432000	10436000	It's now on the PlayStation Network on the cross-media bar. Alright.
10436000	10445000	Let's see. Also, by the beginning of November 2012, we will retire the services available through the Life with PlayStation application.
10446000	10451000	We will stop offering the Life with PlayStation application to new users with the 4.3 update.
10451000	10457000	This includes the conclusion of our participation with Stanford University's Folding at Home.
10457000	10466000	Over 15 million users participated in the program. They've donated more than 100 million computation hours to the Folding at Home project.
10466000	10474000	Um, considering the contribution PS3 has made to the project, we decided to retire it as a result of discussions with Stanford University.
10474000	10481000	So at least it wasn't like they just yanked the plug, but I guess it was a mutual decision. That's kind of interesting.
10481000	10484000	Did they find the cure of what they were looking for? I hope so.
10484000	10486000	Huh.
10486000	10492000	Well, at least it was a mutual decision, but I hope it wasn't one of those mutual decisions meaning Sony went to Stanford saying,
10492000	10495000	this is what we're going to do. Tell us how you're going to deal with it.
10495000	10498000	I don't know. It seems like it was a good thing.
10498000	10500000	Beg for us to change your mind.
10500000	10501000	Right?
10501000	10503000	No? Fine.
10504000	10506000	So. All right.
10506000	10510000	So that's all I've got. So you don't have any more last minute stories?
10510000	10513000	I don't have any more last minute stories. I think that means we're at the end of the show.
10513000	10516000	Windows 8's out this week, right? Excited?
10516000	10518000	Yay.
10518000	10522000	Tigerclaw wants to remind us she can still do Folding at Home on the PC.
10522000	10527000	All right. Um, let's wrap up the show. We're done. We're out of here. Good night.
10527000	10531000	Remember, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10531000	10533000	Word of mouth, it's all we got.
10533000	10538000	We really appreciate the enthusiasm in the fan community through these fan games and all that other stuff.
10538000	10544000	Also, of course, you know, kind words on iTunes reviews, Stitcher promotions, things like that.
10544000	10549000	You know, other iOS devices. What other apps are there? TuneIn. I can't even think of them all.
10549000	10551000	There's so many. And Android, too.
10551000	10555000	Alan has one I've never even heard of that he uses to listen to podcasts, and it's pretty good.
10555000	10560000	So, wherever you heard about Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word. We appreciate it.
10560000	10563000	And, of course, support all the shows on VOG Network.
10563000	10566000	vognetwork.com. We've got a ton of great shows on the network.
10566000	10573000	All week long talking about various geek things, not just gaming shows, but TV shows and movies.
10573000	10577000	Well, no dedicated movie shows yet, but some of them talk about movies.
10577000	10584000	Things about British TV culture, anime shows, Warcraft shows. It's all there, vognetwork.com.
10584000	10586000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10586000	10588000	Loki, we'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.
10588000	10594000	Well, Lisa, if you're going to use Windows 8, there's Start 8 by Stardock.
10594000	10598000	That'll actually put the Start menu back, so it's not so broken.
10600000	10601000	Okay.
10602000	10604000	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10604000	10608000	I'm still pissed that I can't play Mass Effect. Still so pissed.
10608000	10609000	As you should be.
10610000	10612000	And I miss my kitty.
10612000	10615000	I'm sorry. All right.
10615000	10620000	Well, my final thought is I'm hungry and I can't wait for dinner.
10620000	10624000	And it's really too bad that I haven't eaten dinner yet, because you know what even sounds better than dinner?
10624000	10627000	It's Pinkberry. Nah, nah, nah. Maybe later this week.
10627000	10628000	Pinkberry for dinner.
10628000	10629000	Pinkberry for dinner. Someday.
10629000	10632000	Also, and I have one more final thought.
10632000	10635000	RuPaul's All Stars Drag Race starts tomorrow, just so you know.
10635000	10637000	Just so you know. You can watch the...
10637000	10638000	Judging you.
10638000	10642000	Here's the disappointing thing. You can watch the first episode online right up to the elimination.
10642000	10645000	It's okay. It wasn't as good as it should be.
10645000	10648000	I hate the twist. I hate the twist.
10648000	10650000	Reality TV twists are stupid.
10650000	10655000	All right, that's it. If I haven't scared you off already, thanks for tuning into the show and downloading and listening to us.
