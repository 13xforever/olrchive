00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:25,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, October 14th, 2012, an upcoming holiday game is leaked a month early, Valve is looking for some hardware testers, and could you soon feel temperature in your PlayStation controller?

2
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

3
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: which I know a lot of you in the chat room might be going, wait a minute, she's right here.

4
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the magic of the internet, you see.

5
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,480
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sick today.

6
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,700
[SPEAKER_03]: She caught Disneyland plague or something.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,620
[SPEAKER_03]: She caught the gay.

8
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:16,702
[SPEAKER_03]: She went to gay days at Disneyland and wouldn't you know it, she walked away with a horrific case of the gay.

9
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:22,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she will not be here tonight, but she is in chat if you wish to say hello and feel better and so forth.

10
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:27,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, with us tonight in studio, we do have Techmaster Loki.

11
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:27,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

12
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:28,742
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you, Loki?

13
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:29,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm alright.

14
00:01:29,462 --> 00:01:29,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cold.

15
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:31,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a cold, but it's not the gay.

16
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:32,865
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the gay.

17
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:33,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, good.

18
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:36,208
[SPEAKER_04]: The gay doesn't make you all stuffed up, I don't think.

19
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:46,481
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I sound, I definitely have the gay because I'm sounding a little sick today, but I just blew out my voice over on Friday, but I'll talk about that later.

20
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:50,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, also say hello to, we have a guest host here.

21
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:53,384
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it when he's available and on standby.

22
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:54,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Alan.

23
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:55,685
[SPEAKER_05]: It's me again.

24
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:56,745
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you again?

25
00:01:56,886 --> 00:01:57,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.

26
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,566
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's new with you?

27
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,707
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last time we talked to you.

28
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much, working, working a lot.

29
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:03,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to pinch hit last week, but I had to work.

30
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:07,564
[SPEAKER_05]: My amazing boss got me the day off.

31
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:08,724
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta make the money.

32
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:10,405
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

33
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it looks like you're a horrible, terrible boss is in chat right now if you want to say a few words.

34
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,228
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

35
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:23,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving him a hard time on purpose.

36
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:24,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

37
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,870
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do I need to plug here at the top of the show?

38
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

39
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure you listen to us live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after...

40
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:42,339
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bobby Blackwolf Show at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com Home to a variety of great geek shows, not just video game shows.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's important to point out is that, you know, we do have some awesome video game shows, obviously, with this one and Bobby and Girls Gone Wow and Hard House.

42
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:56,751
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have some non-video game shows, things like Under Station Live, Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Anime Jam Session, etc., etc.

43
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:57,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of good stuff.

44
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,594
[SPEAKER_03]: So it all goes down at vognetwork.com

45
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:26,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to come with a kickoff topic tonight but I neglected to think of something because I'm a little bit my voice is shot tonight because and I think a lot of other shows in the network have been talking about this understation live and I just mentioned this on Bobby's show before and I think I've mentioned on here too I was asked I was fortunate enough to be asked to be the director of the return of the Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento and

46
00:03:26,683 --> 00:03:31,126
[SPEAKER_03]: and while it went marvelous on Friday, it was very exhausting.

47
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:33,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I also emceed the show.

48
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm basically screaming obscenities into a mic in front of a crowd of 400 people and it felt really good.

49
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like what I do.

50
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of, kind of.

51
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:44,314
[SPEAKER_03]: On this show every week, except I could see them.

52
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't hide from them.

53
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:47,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see them too.

54
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:59,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew you were going to lose your voice or get damn close to it because when you were shouting your intro, there was a part where you literally blew your voice out.

55
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,848
[SPEAKER_05]: We could hear that sound wasn't like...

56
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,539
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we know that this is the season for video games to become movies.

58
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:29,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I don't know what it is, but every October, well I do know what it is.

59
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:34,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fact that October is kind of the month for Hollywood to release their crap films.

60
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Which usually includes the video game movies.

61
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:41,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, all the Resident Evil movies come out late September, October.

62
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:42,874
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting Silent Hill.

63
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,076
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying these movies are crap.

64
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Hollywood kind of views them as crap because they're kind of in between this summer blockbuster and Oscar nominee.

65
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:53,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Oscar season starts at Thanksgiving.

66
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:54,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

67
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:57,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So most video game movies end up coming out in the October season.

68
00:04:57,757 --> 00:05:01,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if they were actually supposed to be crap, they'd be coming out in January.

69
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just a good time.

70
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the two movies that came out video game-wise this year are both kind of monster Halloween-y movies.

71
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:13,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Resident Evil is more of an action movie, but

72
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:18,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's the Transylvania Hotel or whatever and the Frankenweenie and all that stuff's coming out.

73
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:22,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Wreck-It Ralph very soon, actually.

74
00:05:22,843 --> 00:05:24,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Although technically it's a November movie.

75
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:28,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they're just... Wreck-It Ralph, I mean... Here's the thing about Wreck-It Ralph.

76
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're all excited about Wreck-It Ralph, right?

77
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's Disney and it's video games.

78
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:41,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously there's a great cross-section here that this show represents very well that is very excited for Wreck-It Ralph.

79
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:42,799
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think for...

80
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how it's going to do in the mainstream.

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is still kind of a risky thing for Disney.

82
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:53,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's why it's not their Thanksgiving movie or their Christmas movie.

83
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:57,387
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kind of that odd little place.

84
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,129
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in a place where it will either flop horribly and disappear.

85
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that'll actually happen.

86
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to do better than that.

87
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:41,264
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing is, I think it's going to be a lot of parents who are actually into it because of all the Nintendo references and things they remember taking their kids.

88
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:46,706
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's truly a movie that's geared towards both and there's a lot of people that are excited about that.

89
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:50,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I got on a tangent talking about Wreck-It Ralph.

90
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:59,191
[SPEAKER_03]: What I really wanted to ask about was since we're in this time of year where we talk about video game, movies, and so forth, I just finished doing a stage show

91
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:04,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So what video game do you think deserves a stage show?

92
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:07,341
[SPEAKER_03]: What video game deserves an adaptation?

93
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be a musical, but think Broadway style.

94
00:07:10,946 --> 00:07:16,694
[SPEAKER_03]: What video game do you think should become a full-fledged on or off Broadway production?

95
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:24,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I... Well, they've already kind of done this as a music... Like a video, but... Buggy Saints Row.

96
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:28,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that video was hilarious.

97
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

98
00:07:28,754 --> 00:07:29,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was done Broadway style.

99
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:30,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

100
00:07:30,655 --> 00:07:31,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was hilarious.

101
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,437
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'd go for that.

102
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:41,763
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, have a bunch of people doing, like, you know, the artistic dancing and singing and stuff like that and have video of Saints Row being Buggy.

103
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can even, you know, do Buggy Driver 3.

104
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:44,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Because...

105
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:49,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver 3 is probably very, very, very, very buggy.

106
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I want new music for that, though.

107
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, what would you want to see on Broadway?

108
00:07:56,857 --> 00:07:57,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Maniac Mansion.

109
00:07:57,898 --> 00:07:59,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Maniac Mansion?

110
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,301
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably almost too easy of an answer.

111
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,083
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a TV show at one point, right?

112
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:03,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

113
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:07,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Or my troll answer is Echo the Dolphin.

114
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:09,489
Okay.

115
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,953
[SPEAKER_03]: That wouldn't be a Broadway production so much as it would be like the tank show at SeaWorld.

116
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be like ice capades.

117
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:19,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, someone comes out in a dolphin suit.

118
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: They're swimming through rain.

119
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey.

120
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:25,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying that dolphins can't ice skate?

121
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I want to see that.

122
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they don't have to ice skate, but they can hop up and slide across the ice and then slip back into the water.

123
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:35,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect Halloween

124
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Should Mass Effect be a musical?

125
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,089
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do those effects on a stage.

126
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:49,909
[SPEAKER_03]: That needs a movie.

127
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you could, it would be amazing.

128
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be amazing.

129
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:59,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at some of the answers from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

130
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:02,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Wicked says, Final Fantasy VI, the opera scene.

131
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very, you know... Well, I mean, technically it was an opera.

132
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:12,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, now you're talking about the play that became the video game that became the play.

133
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:12,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

134
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game type of thing.

135
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,826
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is in our chat tonight saying Clu Clu Land.

136
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:23,947
[SPEAKER_03]: How would that work?

137
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:25,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody would just pole dance on stage.

138
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Clu Clu Land would be a showgirls type thing.

139
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Irritating stick.

140
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:32,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Katamari Damacy.

141
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

142
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:36,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow, that would be a hell of a stage show.

143
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like Lion King right there.

144
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like some crazy stuff.

145
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:46,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's going to come out of there and be like, did I just drop acid or something?

146
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,309
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to that?

147
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan in our chatroom says, Space Channel 5 should be on Broadway.

148
00:09:52,573 --> 00:09:54,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there you go, there's a great musical idea.

149
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,357
[SPEAKER_03]: That could actually work.

150
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:13,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of sad That could work Sad in an awesome way though Let's see SSJ100Matt says Parappa the Rappa Let's see Stan says in Chicago they've done a Mario burlesque show Same with Zelda I think

151
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,237
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just cosplay strippers.

152
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:18,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

153
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,499
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that is.

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Burlesque show.

155
00:10:21,461 --> 00:10:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

156
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just add some class to that.

157
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:26,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fucking cosplay person stripping.

158
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:30,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, now, I have friends that do burlesque that would take a lot of offense to what you're saying right now.

159
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

160
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I aim to offend everybody.

161
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,390
[SPEAKER_03]: You are so rude.

162
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and here's the thing.

163
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:40,632
[SPEAKER_03]: At least you can say this.

164
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:44,613
[SPEAKER_03]: If the burlesque community has done it, you know what other communities probably done it?

165
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Drag queens.

166
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:51,874
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is, has there been a Mario or Zelda drag queen show?

167
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, you used to live in the city and go to these shows.

168
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,316
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the craziest drag queen show you saw in the city?

169
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:03,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they were all really amazing, actually.

170
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,622
[SPEAKER_05]: One time I went and they did Ziggy Stardust album from start to finish.

171
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:08,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

172
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:11,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Smashing Pumpkins, Drag Tribute Night.

173
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:11,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.

174
00:11:12,386 --> 00:11:12,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

175
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:16,349
[SPEAKER_03]: See, when I think of drag queens, I don't think of Smashing Pumpkins, so that's kind of interesting.

176
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:17,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's why San Francisco's more alternative.

177
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, excuse me.

178
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:22,114
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco's hipster drag, apparently.

179
00:11:22,134 --> 00:11:22,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

180
00:11:24,678 --> 00:11:28,000
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole cabaret, you know, the greatest level of all, you're not going to find that there.

181
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma in the chat says, Loki, I know people that do cosplay burlesque, dude.

182
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Burlesque stripping, fine.

183
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:44,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we really just going to like... Are you telling me that the end of the... And it's happening in Ranma's room.

184
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, are you telling me that the end of the show that they don't end up with less clothing on, therefore they are stripping off clothing?

185
00:11:50,849 --> 00:11:52,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing.

186
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:53,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of this world

187
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,663
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Morpheus in chat says, I saw a peach drag queen at New York Comic Con.

188
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:28,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I gotta say, the peach drag queen thing has been done at several conventions.

189
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen that.

190
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:30,567
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

191
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:48,134
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

192
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:19,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 3, the DLC that came out.

193
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:21,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Been playing the hell out of that.

194
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:24,033
[SPEAKER_05]: They added, you know, we talked about, or you guys talked about it a little bit last week.

195
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:30,437
[SPEAKER_05]: The Collectors, which were the antagonists in 2, are now an enemy class that you can roll into in the multiplayer matches.

196
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:36,721
[SPEAKER_05]: And I unlocked the Volus Adept, which is an ultra rare and 7 unlockable character.

197
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:42,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure saying Volus Adept is the same as saying, like, Pineapple Toaster Oven to most people in our listeners.

198
00:13:43,084 --> 00:13:44,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Pineapple Toaster Oven?

199
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

200
00:13:44,665 --> 00:13:45,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome!

201
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I like pineapple and I like toaster ovens.

202
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds amazing.

203
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I unlocked one of the new coveted secret characters.

204
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,989
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a toaster oven that cuts the pineapple for you?

205
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to.

206
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:26,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Black Mesa Source a little bit but not as much as I have been because I already went through and beat it and I'm waiting for them to patch in the end of the game Mass Effect Infiltrator because about three weeks ago I upgraded my phone I now have a Galaxy S3 I believe Bobby Blackwolf got one about a month ago so I downloaded the Infiltrator Mass Effect game for it

207
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:35,957
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks gorgeous, but it controls so bad that it makes me angry that I spent the four bucks on it.

208
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:41,666
[SPEAKER_05]: It controls so poorly for me that it makes me feel like... Have you ever had someone...

209
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:53,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You show them a game like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto, and it's someone who does not play video games, and you hand them the controller, and you're like, okay, here's how you move, and here's how you get in a car, and they just drive off a cliff.

210
00:14:53,978 --> 00:14:57,943
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing they do is they just die because they don't know how to play games.

211
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Infiltrator controls so poorly that it makes me feel like I'm one of those people.

212
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:12,208
[SPEAKER_05]: and I told James about it and he has it on iPad and he said he made himself beat it just because he has a boner for Mass Effect and he's like, oh yeah, the game's a total piece of shit.

213
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe I beat it all the way through.

214
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks for some of these hardcore franchises.

215
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Fruit Ninja, yes.

216
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,343
[SPEAKER_05]: For whatever they're doing in that game, no.

217
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,349
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really it, I think.

218
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and Tiny Tower.

219
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to play Tiny Tower, which is like a two-year-old iPhone game, but

220
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But since you're coming off having the phone that doesn't even have a QWERTY keyboard on it, too.

221
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:58,481
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the BlackBerry equivalent of the Nokia brick.

222
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:03,328
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the classic, you know, you throw the Nokia brick at a car and the car explodes and the brick is fine.

223
00:16:03,348 --> 00:16:04,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the BlackBerry equivalent of that.

224
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, so going from that to this...

225
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Android, Ice Cream Sandwich, ooh, you know, little laptop in your pocket is quite a change.

226
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,576
[SPEAKER_05]: In Tiny Tower, I give all of my stores perverted names.

227
00:16:18,597 --> 00:16:20,378
[SPEAKER_05]: The laundromat is called the Stank Panties.

228
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got, the TV studio is named after a porn website, which I'm not going to say.

229
00:16:27,143 --> 00:16:30,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually, it's Porn Studio because of the name I gave it.

230
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's good times.

231
00:16:32,026 --> 00:16:33,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times, killer game.

232
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:43,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, just to fan the flames of this, what made you decide to go with the Galaxy S3 on the day the iPhone 5 came out?

233
00:16:44,815 --> 00:17:13,705
[SPEAKER_05]: to be pragmatic about it you represent the Apple portion of this household which is fine I'm not hating on that but it's like if we want to be you know the ultimate geek duo we need Android representation up in here so that people can come to us and they will ask Rob the Apple questions they can ask me the Android questions if I want to be pragmatic about it make sure all of our braces are covered that is the best possible answer you could have given good job this is why I keep I will investigate whatever it is you don't like

234
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:16,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

235
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:20,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they ask you about the Apple stuff, like, why should I get an iPhone 5?

236
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's new!

237
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:23,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta get the new thing.

238
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:31,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So this week I've actually been trying to catch up on a lot of stuff that I haven't been playing because I've been playing a lot of Minecraft or whatever.

239
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:35,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's see, this week I played some Vita stuff.

240
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That was also another thing.

241
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:38,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to play games on the Vita because...

242
00:17:39,585 --> 00:18:03,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been and it was sorely neglected so I tried out a couple demos I had first Gravity Rush which was pretty cool just not really something I mean it's a good game but it's not something I'm going to be playing because I just don't want to play a lot of different games right now I've already got plenty of my play right now but it's a it's a unique looking game it's fun

243
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,860
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played that.

244
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I played LittleBigPlanet Vita.

245
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was something I was like, oh, I'm probably going to get this.

246
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:11,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I played it, and it's LittleBigPlanet.

247
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great, but it's got the Vita gimmicks that you kind of expect in there.

248
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just kind of like, eh, it's another LittleBigPlanet game.

249
00:18:19,426 --> 00:18:21,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably won't play this, so I'm not going to get it.

250
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:23,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a bummer.

251
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, it's not that at all.

252
00:18:25,288 --> 00:18:25,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good game.

253
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:26,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

254
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I have LittleBigPlanet 2 that I haven't played.

255
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:33,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I going to buy another LittleBigPlanet game that I probably won't play?

256
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:42,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to finish other games first before... I'm just trying not to get into that mode of, like, I need to get all these games because they're good.

257
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:50,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm going to be sitting on all these games that are good and not have time to play them and then more good stuff's going to come out and I'm not going to have time to play that.

258
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:55,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up... There's a ton of games I have that are really old that I haven't played yet.

259
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:55,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Like...

260
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:57,895
[SPEAKER_04]: and 3D.GameHeroes.

261
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:01,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lent that out to so many people and I have yet to play that game.

262
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:02,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good game.

263
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a good game.

264
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a good game.

265
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:08,761
[SPEAKER_04]: But that game came out around the same time as Red Dead Redemption or something.

266
00:19:08,841 --> 00:19:11,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just like, ooh, Red Dead Redemption.

267
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just kind of lost track of that.

268
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:15,509
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a new story coming up later.

269
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:20,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll mention it then, but there's this really good sale going on right now on a bundle of games.

270
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:25,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like all things that people tell me I should play and I've missed.

271
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:32,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, wow, for a very, very, very small amount of money, I could catch up on three years worth of gaming.

272
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:40,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that amount of money, I think it's a good deal, even if you don't play them, because that amount of money for one of those games... We're getting ahead of ourselves, though.

273
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

274
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:41,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

275
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:50,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The game I actually did want to play, and I bought it mainly because it came out on this platform first, was Retro City Rampage.

276
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:52,953
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been looking forward to this game forever now.

277
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:58,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have the whole cross-buy thing on the PlayStation Network so you can get it for your PS3 and Vita.

278
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bought it for my Vita.

279
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:27,418
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's fantastic if I didn't have a cold at the point when I was playing it my body was aching and my eyes were just like burning if it wasn't for that I would probably have played a lot more of it but it's a fantastic game and there's just so many homages to everything it's just crammed full of just so much fan service and just like oh my god I remember that and even stuff that will probably fly over your head but

280
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fantastic game.

281
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just basically the best description I read for it was someone says it's a developer's love letter to the industry for all the 8-bit games that he played.

282
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:43,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It even has modern references and stuff in it.

283
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:45,323
[SPEAKER_04]: The story is just throwaway.

284
00:20:45,383 --> 00:20:50,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes no sense whatsoever, but it's got everything, and it's seriously a great game.

285
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:55,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am looking forward to playing that on my PlayStation 3, hopefully, but on the Vita, it's still pretty awesome.

286
00:20:55,847 --> 00:21:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, the game does tend to make the screen a lot smaller, like in different sections of the map and stuff like that, and so playing on a Vita, I'm sure it's not so bad on a TV, but on the Vita, the screen gets really small, so that might be something that might turn people off from it, but

287
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:16,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun game, especially if you like, you know, Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.

288
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:17,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very much like that.

289
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:24,142
[SPEAKER_04]: But even if you don't like Grand Theft Auto, it's still a great, you know, action game with just all sorts of crazy stuff in it.

290
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:28,225
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, from Bionic Commando to Bill and Ted to Back to the Future.

291
00:21:29,285 --> 00:21:30,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

292
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, more Minecraft.

293
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Played a lot more Minecraft.

294
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:35,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Fished up my castle, basically.

295
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:41,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, come join the server if you haven't yet.

296
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:49,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Call of Duty, we bought Map Pack 2, so we're going to start playing some new maps because we're just kind of getting bored of the ones we're playing.

297
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:53,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, tried doing another Streak Week, missed it by another game.

298
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:55,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

299
00:21:55,841 --> 00:21:57,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting close, getting close.

300
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:00,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else?

301
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:03,444
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was it, actually.

302
00:22:03,464 --> 00:22:04,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was all the games I played.

303
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:06,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So Alan, you'll get a kick out of this.

304
00:22:06,878 --> 00:22:09,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how, and the live listeners will understand this.

305
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Podcast listeners, I apologize for a minute, but we're having these stream dropouts.

306
00:22:13,103 --> 00:22:14,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's happened twice.

307
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:21,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we, just so you guys know, we actually purposely left the internet off for an hour today while we went to go run errands.

308
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,011
[SPEAKER_05]: The cable modem and the router off for an hour.

309
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:31,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a complete power cycle of every damn technological thing in this house so OLR can stay up with no downtime tonight.

310
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:32,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're on two.

311
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:36,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not in this house.

312
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,103
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is not in this house.

313
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:40,605
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is on their end.

314
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, why do you guys keep dropping our stuff?

315
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if it's not because sometimes I see that we're still sending data

316
00:22:52,095 --> 00:23:02,897
[SPEAKER_03]: and they start complaining in chat that it dropped and I'm like, it didn't drop because I see that we're still sending data because if Comcast goes down, then our net should stop working, I should get booted from IRC, all of that should happen.

317
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:07,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes me wonder, is it our stream provider that's really having the issue?

318
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:08,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't happen to Bobby.

319
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:10,699
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, it doesn't happen to Bobby.

320
00:23:10,939 --> 00:23:11,799
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done it for an hour.

321
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:14,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So what the hell's the problem?

322
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Could be our, is he, where is, sorry, forgetting all, where's it located?

323
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are we piping to right now?

324
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:50,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's a good question that I don't know the answer to, that maybe Bobby does Cause if it's in the Midwest or the South, it could be our connection to there, and he's in Atlanta It very well could be, let me see if this tells me where we beam the show to, because I'm actually not sure Such great radio right now I know, but you know what, deal with it Um, it says New Jersey, so it would be infinitely closer Oh yeah, so for us, if we're piping to New Jersey then, there's, yeah, it's probably the stream Weird To us

325
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, it is New Jersey, so no wonder the stream's getting late.

326
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:53,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, stop it.

327
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else do you want to offend tonight while we're at it?

328
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:57,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

329
00:23:57,624 --> 00:23:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still early.

330
00:23:58,445 --> 00:23:59,445
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't even started story yet.

331
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,905
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done burlesque people.

332
00:24:01,846 --> 00:24:02,846
[SPEAKER_03]: You've done New Jersey.

333
00:24:02,866 --> 00:24:04,607
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with burlesque.

334
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:10,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Burlesque is awesome because it's, once again, women stripping off their clothes, which is, you know, that's fine.

335
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:16,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I think really the only difference between burlesque and strippers is strippers kind of go all the way, whereas burlesque is more of the tease and stuff.

336
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:16,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

337
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:19,593
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're still stripping off their clothes.

338
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:28,284
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like, you know, Skinemex strippers versus, you know, the stripper strippers, I guess.

339
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:29,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy, all right.

340
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Who spilled Jaeger and spray tan on the server rack?

341
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:36,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to my gaming week.

342
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a very DarkSakura week.

343
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:41,045
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week was very DarkSakura.

344
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:42,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Does everybody know what that means?

345
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:43,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Aspect and WoW.

346
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:43,666
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

347
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:44,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Sims?

348
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:48,969
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's DarkSakura circa 2009 gaming week.

349
00:24:49,469 --> 00:24:51,870
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week this week was I played a lot of WoW.

350
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some dailies.

351
00:24:56,232 --> 00:25:01,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say a lot of WoW because I didn't play a lot of WoW because I've had weeks where I've played a lot of WoW.

352
00:25:01,694 --> 00:25:02,895
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is not one of those weeks.

353
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:05,936
[SPEAKER_03]: But I played enough WoW to do a few dailies here and there and so forth.

354
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:07,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I played Mass Effect 3.

355
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:16,419
[SPEAKER_03]: because, as Alan mentioned, the new DLC went up, the multiplayer DLC, and it's very well-rounded.

356
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a whole new class of aliens that you can fight, the collectors from Part 2, so that breathes new life into it.

357
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,902
[SPEAKER_03]: It has some new classes.

358
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:30,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter because I won't be seeing them anyway because I never get that stuff in my...

359
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:35,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Premium Spectre packs, but I did finally get one of the ones I really wanted.

360
00:25:35,586 --> 00:25:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Cerberus Adept, and I've been playing that class a lot because he's the guy with the whips, and you're just like, Hulk smash!

361
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:42,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulk smash!

362
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:44,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything, and it's great.

363
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Vanguard's like that, too.

364
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:46,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's awesome.

365
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we were doing a multiplayer match earlier with some friends, and one of my friends was like, who sent the body flying out the window?

366
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:52,832
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, me.

367
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:57,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is still really fun.

368
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:01,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that they've staggered this content a bit.

369
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:02,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like, what is it?

370
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:06,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Tuesday, we're going to get just a handful of new things, right?

371
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:07,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Every Tuesday for a little while.

372
00:26:08,243 --> 00:26:08,843
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

373
00:26:08,924 --> 00:26:13,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they're doing it because there are 16 new kits where a kit is a...

374
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:14,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

375
00:26:14,428 --> 00:26:14,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

376
00:26:14,828 --> 00:26:14,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

377
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe that's what they do.

378
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:31,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

379
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter IV Street Fighter IV, yeah.

380
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:16,123
[SPEAKER_03]: You've probably got all the other achievements by now.

381
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:17,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's not a lot else to work towards.

382
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:22,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, heck, you haven't even been playing since launch, but your N7 score is what?

383
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,188
[SPEAKER_03]: 800 and something now?

384
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,048
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like 820 now.

385
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:29,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be higher, but when I do golds and silvers, I'm usually on a level 20 and they don't gain XP.

386
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

387
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:31,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

388
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:32,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

389
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:33,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

390
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well that was my gaming week.

391
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:36,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move into some housekeeping.

392
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:39,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We are on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

393
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,902
[SPEAKER_03]: We are on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

394
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:49,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe today or tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow, is the last day to nominate us for the podcast awards.

395
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:56,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, for your consideration, Best Gaming Podcast and the Stitcher Awards also going on right now.

396
00:27:56,353 --> 00:27:59,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they end either tomorrow or Friday.

397
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:00,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So please...

398
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Consider a nomination for us there as well for Best Gaming Podcast.

399
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,622
[SPEAKER_03]: If for whatever reason you don't want to vote for us, that's cool.

400
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:13,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Please support one of the other shows on the VOG Network or at least, bare minimum, support Indie Podcast.

401
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:16,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Stitcher, I believe it's every day or every day you can vote.

402
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,671
[SPEAKER_03]: You can nominate for Stitcher every day.

403
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:19,171
[SPEAKER_03]: You can.

404
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So Podcast Award is just one nomination.

405
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:28,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed and let you know what happens either next week or in a couple weeks when those nominations are announced.

406
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:28,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember,

407
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, I hate the whole begging for votes thing, but it really is good exposure.

408
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:42,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys, as much as some of these big podcasts are fine, the NPR podcasts are great.

409
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:44,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, wait, wait, don't tell me it's a great show.

410
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:48,964
[SPEAKER_03]: The Adam Carolla show is a fine show if you like him and all that.

411
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:53,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't need the additional exposure.

412
00:28:53,045 --> 00:28:55,186
[SPEAKER_03]: They have plenty of corporate exposure and stuff.

413
00:28:55,206 --> 00:28:58,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really want to see the indies succeed in these shows.

414
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:00,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a lot of really good indie programs too.

415
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:02,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like there's good indie games.

416
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on to the news.

417
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, no, one other thing I gotta plug.

418
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important.

419
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:14,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I always like to plug the shows that are kind enough to invite me on as a guest.

420
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:15,932
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was a guest this week.

421
00:29:15,972 --> 00:29:18,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how I fit this in this week, but I did.

422
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a guest on Nerdgasm Network, their gaming show.

423
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:23,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It's episode 54 of...

424
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:25,635
[SPEAKER_03]: NerdgasmNetwork.com

425
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,491
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll hear more about putting it all out on the table, and I'll just leave it at that.

426
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:55,912
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into some gaming news.

427
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:57,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more burlesque talk, I guess.

428
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:57,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yes.

429
00:29:58,353 --> 00:30:00,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, very similar to burlesque, but in a different way.

430
00:30:01,914 --> 00:30:04,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to gaming news, Loki.

431
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's another year, so another Microsoft game has been leaked.

432
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:08,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Hurrah!

433
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:18,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Microsoft is investigating a report of Halo 4 being leaked, and they're working with law enforcement to address the issue.

434
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:28,506
[SPEAKER_04]: There's images being surfaced on social networking sites depicting retail discs and a dashboard featuring the game ready to play, blah blah blah.

435
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:29,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already leaked.

436
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:32,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's absolutely 100% been leaked.

437
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:33,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out there.

438
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:40,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know, they're like, well, we're clarified with that's actually it's been leaked 100%.

439
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been leaked.

440
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:44,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

441
00:30:46,116 --> 00:30:46,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Has it been leaked?

442
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been leaked.

443
00:30:49,614 --> 00:31:09,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that much more you can say other than it's pretty good and also I guess some other information apparently the game is going to be on two discs the second disc is going to contain installation data for the multiplayer stuff and once you've installed that then you can actually play the game with the first disc kind of like Forza 4

444
00:31:10,023 --> 00:31:11,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Loki, help me understand something.

445
00:31:12,084 --> 00:31:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: How are people able to play this game before the release date?

446
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:17,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Piracy.

447
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:18,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

448
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:19,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

449
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:23,951
[SPEAKER_03]: But piracy's bad.

450
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:25,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It is bad, and they will get banned if they go online.

451
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:27,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

452
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And Microsoft called the po-po.

453
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're really investigating.

454
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, look, obviously...

455
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:42,402
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna say, you know, they're gonna invoke the police because, and you know, it is a crime.

456
00:31:43,183 --> 00:31:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You can poo-poo it all you want, but stealing shit is a crime, right?

457
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:52,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but what will the police really do to investigate, you think?

458
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:59,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think the police is coming after little Johnny Pirate that went on the Pirate Bay and downloaded the program?

459
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:04,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think the police are looking more into how the leak happened?

460
00:32:04,682 --> 00:32:06,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're trying to find out how it got leaked.

461
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:09,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then the police aren't doing a very good job.

462
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:16,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to say it, but let's see, Gears of War 3 leaked, Halo 3 leaked, like every big Microsoft title leaks.

463
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Fable the Journey leak or did that just slip off the radar?

464
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:26,767
[SPEAKER_04]: No, any title out there, any title that's being released is leaked usually a week before it comes out.

465
00:32:26,787 --> 00:32:31,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that happens is because that's how the shipment schedule is for retailers.

466
00:32:31,611 --> 00:32:45,503
[SPEAKER_04]: They usually get stuff Monday prior, or if it's direct retail partners like, say, GameStop and BestFies and stuff like that, they're getting their product probably the week before on a Wednesday or something like that.

467
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's how I think this happened.

468
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is totally speculative.

469
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:52,259
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the week before.

470
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:55,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo is not supposed to be out for like three weeks.

471
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

472
00:32:56,822 --> 00:32:57,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's how I think it happened.

473
00:32:57,683 --> 00:32:58,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a couple of ways.

474
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:03,207
[SPEAKER_04]: One, someone nabbed a copy when they were pressing it.

475
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:05,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, an actual copy out of the duplicator.

476
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:21,501
[SPEAKER_04]: or, and this happens occasionally, the warehouse that ships the product, the Microsoft product, will misship something and accidentally send something early, like way earlier than they're supposed to receive it in.

477
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:36,131
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, personally, we had some Skylanders stuff for the new Skylanders Giants that they accidentally shipped us earlier than it should have been, like about a week earlier, which is usually unusual.

478
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:37,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, lucky you.

479
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Some lucky asshole got Halo 4.

480
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,897
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Skylanders.

481
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,758
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

482
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:46,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not doing anything with Skylanders, but I'm just saying it happens.

483
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:50,067
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been Microsoft-released games in the last few weeks.

484
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:53,111
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Fable, and then next week we've got...

485
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Central 3, Forza, Horizon

486
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: or who knows it could have just been somewhere else an employee you never know I mean because it's one of the biggest games this and probably Call of Duty Black Ops 2 are gonna be like the ones the scene groups out there fight each other who's gonna be able to release it first and you know it's it's all bragging all EPing bragging rights basically like oh I'm playing Halo and you're not or so that's that's it

487
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:36,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the question I have to ask.

488
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:39,542
[SPEAKER_03]: How can Microsoft stop this?

489
00:34:39,983 --> 00:34:42,508
[SPEAKER_03]: How can Microsoft stop that leak from happening?

490
00:34:43,578 --> 00:34:45,438
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't.

491
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:51,680
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to be more secure about how they duplicate their game, just the whole handling process of it.

492
00:34:52,260 --> 00:35:01,462
[SPEAKER_04]: The way other publishers do it, at least they try to prevent street date violators, is by delivering a product as late as possible to those retail chains.

493
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:05,142
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking like getting it a day early instead of a week early, that type of thing.

494
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:11,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, something like this, as far as we're aware, this hasn't even hit the retail chains yet.

495
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:12,244
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just...

496
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:14,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

497
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:29,654
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

498
00:35:57,401 --> 00:36:01,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's not good, but I don't think it's really going to hurt them in the end.

499
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're still going to sell a buttload of those.

500
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:12,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the reality is you kind of have to ask yourself if you're going to download one of these games and so forth.

501
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:29,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I the type of person that sits there and goes, aw, every time I hear one of these stories about game developers closing or why did Big Bad EA close such and such developer or so forth, yet I'm not allowing said company to make money?

502
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of can't have both, right?

503
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:36,024
[SPEAKER_04]: People have to get paid.

504
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't think that's fair, though.

505
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:41,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what you're basically saying, though, those are a lot of these secondary companies and stuff.

506
00:36:41,588 --> 00:36:44,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of it has nothing to do with how well the game sold.

507
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:48,694
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to cut profits because it didn't sell as many copies as they thought it would.

508
00:36:48,754 --> 00:36:52,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily because piracy ate up hundreds of thousands of copies.

509
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:57,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, that's assuming that every person that pirates something would have bought the game regularly.

510
00:36:58,903 --> 00:36:59,363
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

511
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:31,242
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as I don't want to agree with you I think I actually kind of do I think a vast number of people who pirate games were never going to buy that game in the first place I'm going to tell you this much they only download it because they can

512
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:32,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

513
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I did it with Grand Theft Auto 4.

514
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 4 came out.

515
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It leaked down the internet one week before it came out.

516
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I still bought the game, but I wanted to play it right now.

517
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:45,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to play it as early as possible, and so I did.

518
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:48,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it a week early, but who cares?

519
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:50,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've more than paid for it.

520
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:50,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought, what...

521
00:37:51,549 --> 00:38:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: 6 copies of the game when it came out and 6 copies of episodes from Liberty City when it came out and 6 copies of the first DLC before the episodes from Liberty City stuff came out I think they got my money so I don't feel so bad about playing the game a week early

522
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is why the industry is very eager to get on digital distribution.

523
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:21,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is why you see some companies maybe rushing digital distribution and really trying to push it more and more is because if you think about it, digital distribution is a great way to curb piracy.

524
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:31,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't stop it, but it would stop these leaks from happening because essentially you've cut out the entire process of printing the discs and the going gold and shipping and the problems there.

525
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You're cutting that all.

526
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:33,057
[SPEAKER_04]: all out.

527
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,800
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what leaks out even earlier than games like this?

528
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:37,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Live Arcade games.

529
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:38,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

530
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:40,085
[SPEAKER_04]: They leak out even earlier.

531
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:40,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Know why?

532
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:41,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

533
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people have access to PartnerNet still.

534
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:46,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And people download them off PartnerNet and they put them out there.

535
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,174
[SPEAKER_05]: They just crack it and put it out and

536
00:38:48,314 --> 00:38:48,454
[SPEAKER_04]: HALO 4

537
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:07,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's going to get pirated.

538
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:10,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all the games get pirated, but I don't think that they're going to sell.

539
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:13,913
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be like, oh, crap, it didn't sell at all.

540
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:15,274
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not going to happen.

541
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:21,617
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's going to shut down 343 Studios because it didn't sell because of, oh, piracy, it just ruined the whole game.

542
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:22,837
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not like that.

543
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:28,420
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not that many people, compared to the millions of people who buy it, that pirate games.

544
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:35,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a small section, but they would want you to think it is because they've got to blame their loss of sales on something.

545
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:43,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think though that if this hadn't happened maybe they would have sold a quarter million more copies?

546
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:44,339
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

547
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if this hadn't happened it's going to leak out again when it comes out and those same people will have pirated it.

548
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:57,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramma in our chatroom says Halo 4 could come out at $19.99 and yet it will be pirated.

549
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:05,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com follows that up with iPhone piracy is rampant and that's 99 cent apps.

550
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:10,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a perfect example where it's like people do it because they can.

551
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:17,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you're giving someone the option to get something for free versus paying for it, why wouldn't you get it for free?

552
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:24,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand that there's this whole morality of, oh, well, if I don't pay... I mean, they try to push this shit on you even at the movie theater.

553
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:24,699
[SPEAKER_03]: And legality.

554
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:26,140
[SPEAKER_04]: You are taking a risk.

555
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but it's just... Okay.

556
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's... It would be like...

557
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:33,203
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

558
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:59,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It just has a hole over everything that you can't catch everybody.

559
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:05,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The best defense is to stop the people that upload them in the first place, and then there's nothing for them to pirate.

560
00:41:05,736 --> 00:41:06,296
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

561
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:13,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I could look you in the eye with a straight face and totally mean it and say, you would never catch me down there being one of those looters.

562
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:15,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think it's wrong.

563
00:41:15,622 --> 00:41:18,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would never participate in a looting event like that.

564
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really believe that about my character.

565
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:27,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to say I'm better than anybody else or whatever, but I know they had a situation like that happen in Britain not that long ago.

566
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:32,747
[SPEAKER_03]: There were these huge riots and all these things, and there were these looting, and a bunch of kids got caught and went to jail and all this stuff.

567
00:41:32,787 --> 00:41:36,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember looking at it going, what a bunch of fucking thugs.

568
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:38,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be one of those thugs.

569
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,048
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just ridiculous, that stuff.

570
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:44,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Mainly my analogy was that how do you go after everybody?

571
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:49,630
[SPEAKER_05]: As a literal metaphor, I don't really think that's the best comparison.

572
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:55,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, once again, the video game industry or the movie industry would like you to think that that's exactly the same thing.

573
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:25,927
[SPEAKER_04]: the great debate that will never end but maybe this is why we see more free to play games happening because it's like fuck it we'll make our money other ways no seriously that's a great idea as long as you can secure DLC but that's a great idea because then it's like fuck pirate it as much as you want get as many copies out there because that's more people that can buy the DLC for it

574
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:51,210
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's why I think it is more popular approach because it gets the game into more people's hands and more people want to try it because it's free there if it sucks whatever I just delete it you know and that that's why I think it is a good way to go but then again at the same time some of these companies are getting greedy and they're taking the free-to-play model for their paid games and that's just pissing people off even more and they're like fuck you I'm just gonna I'm not only am I gonna pirate this game but I'm also gonna pirate all your DLC

575
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:54,917
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, moving on.

576
00:42:55,578 --> 00:43:00,182
[SPEAKER_03]: This piracy debate will never be settled, so I'm going to go ahead in the interest of time and move on with the news.

577
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:06,607
[SPEAKER_03]: But what a great segue talking about a game that a lot of people probably just should have pirated.

578
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:07,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real.

579
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:08,149
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't very good.

580
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:08,889
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

581
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:09,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

582
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trolling.

583
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trolling.

584
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:13,653
[SPEAKER_03]: But pirated DLC and all that definitely goes with this, too.

585
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:15,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Street Fighter X Tekken.

586
00:43:16,436 --> 00:43:16,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

587
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:18,317
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't pirate something that's already on the disc.

588
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:19,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

589
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:22,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

590
00:43:37,206 --> 00:43:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the Trash Bags, hefty update later this year.

591
00:43:40,627 --> 00:43:48,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It is supposed to rebalance the game, provide visual and mechanical tweaks, which I find interesting that they're going to actually tweak some of the visuals.

592
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:58,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Every character in Street Fighter X Tekken is supposed to get some type of balancing tweaks and so forth, including Ken, Kazuya, Kami, Julia, and so on and so on.

593
00:43:58,194 --> 00:43:58,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots, lots.

594
00:44:00,735 --> 00:44:16,575
[SPEAKER_03]: also don't forget Street Fighter X Tekken is coming to the Vita I don't know if that means these same balancing things are already in that finished version or if there's a day one patch or whatever but that is due on October 23rd as a reminder that's just around the corner Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita didn't that game flop?

595
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:30,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I think flop is a strong word but I think it didn't perform as well as they'd probably hoped word of mouth from friends who are usually like Capcom for life and just the reviews were like this is not very good

596
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:54,750
[SPEAKER_03]: what I'm really curious about is where's the other half of this because we were supposed to be seeing Tekken cross Street Fighter and I'm wondering if Namco just started working on it this year they were working on Tekken Tag 2 maybe they've been developing them side by side they have the engine their joint project for this was announced 2 or 3 years ago right?

597
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:01,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

598
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:41,882
[SPEAKER_03]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase CROWN Do you live in the Seattle area?

599
00:45:42,523 --> 00:45:43,404
[SPEAKER_05]: If so... No!

600
00:45:46,187 --> 00:46:02,895
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do, you might want to head over to Valve Software's website and take a little playtester survey and see if maybe you could become a hardware tester for their Valve appliance which clearly exists in some form though they haven't given it a name and we don't know what exactly it does.

601
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:03,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's a fridge.

602
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope it's a pineapple toaster oven.

603
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:11,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, if you are in the Seattle and Bellevue area, is it?

604
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:12,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

605
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:18,054
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking for hardware testers, and it's a questionnaire.

606
00:46:18,094 --> 00:46:19,195
[SPEAKER_05]: How long have you been gaming?

607
00:46:20,016 --> 00:46:20,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a completionist?

608
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:22,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you an achievement hunter?

609
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:25,600
[SPEAKER_05]: How often do you unlock 100% of everything?

610
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:30,885
[SPEAKER_05]: How often do you beat completely every game that you play from start to finish?

611
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:32,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You wouldn't be qualified for this, Rob.

612
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:33,367
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

613
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:34,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

614
00:46:35,308 --> 00:46:39,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can expect people that go into this to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

615
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:40,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, up through the teeth.

616
00:46:40,953 --> 00:46:43,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can expect that those will be broken.

617
00:46:45,356 --> 00:46:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait.

618
00:46:45,897 --> 00:46:55,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So from however many months ago that they were looking for hardware engineers, they have an alpha clearly that they want people under lock and key to go check out.

619
00:46:55,884 --> 00:46:56,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

620
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:58,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever their Steam box is.

621
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:00,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to what leaks out of this.

622
00:47:00,448 --> 00:47:00,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

623
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, Loki.

624
00:47:04,252 --> 00:47:05,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

625
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:10,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, remember that there was the announcement that Sony has bought Gaikai.

626
00:47:11,317 --> 00:47:17,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now Gaikai's website, they've been updated to kind of resemble a little bit more of the PlayStation lineup.

627
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:24,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You see images of Loving Planet as well as Uncharted and it looks like Killzone in there as well.

628
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:29,511
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some stills from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance and...

629
00:47:32,192 --> 00:47:42,856
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really say any additional details or something, but obviously it seems like this is something that's going to be offered as part of the PlayStation platform soon.

630
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:51,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can probably expect some game streaming either by the end of this year or maybe an announcement at E3, if nothing else.

631
00:47:53,580 --> 00:48:00,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, around the same time though, Gaikai, they've kind of found themselves as part of a patent lawsuit.

632
00:48:01,185 --> 00:48:06,769
[SPEAKER_04]: A Delaware company called T5 Labs, they filed a suit against them.

633
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:19,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess their patent for providing a system and methods of sharing a graphics processing unit between plurality of programs.

634
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:25,426
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the patent.

635
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:34,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm not sure if this is just a patent troll company or if this is actually a company that does this stuff, but I'd be willing to bet it's probably a patent troll company.

636
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:40,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they have no comment on it, but there is a lawsuit in place.

637
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this what really put OnLive out of business?

638
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:51,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I would have thought if anybody was going to complain, it would have been one of the other companies that deals in this same technology.

639
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:55,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be willing to bet that T5 Labs probably hasn't put anything out.

640
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:57,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably can't even find them on the internet.

641
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:00,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to even check that out right now.

642
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

643
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:02,231
[SPEAKER_04]: T5 Labs.

644
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:03,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

645
00:49:03,812 --> 00:49:05,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they even a part of the internet?

646
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:07,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here we go.

647
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:09,056
[SPEAKER_04]: T5Labs.com.

648
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:16,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it looks like they've got some crappy flash animation on here.

649
00:49:18,703 --> 00:49:22,106
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's implied that it has to do with games because...

650
00:49:24,155 --> 00:49:24,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Wars Scrolls

651
00:49:40,472 --> 00:49:44,013
[SPEAKER_04]: T5 Labs enables people to play PC games on their existing set-top box.

652
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:48,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The service operates on a video-on-demand client-type system.

653
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:54,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It says T5 Labs' patent-pending technology allows the system to work on ultra-low latency.

654
00:49:54,815 --> 00:49:56,296
[SPEAKER_04]: We call it Instinct Gaming.

655
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:01,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that does sound like Dakai.

656
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it does seem like then that they are actually making something.

657
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a patent-troll company, so...

658
00:50:08,248 --> 00:50:09,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I am corrected.

659
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:11,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

660
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:15,294
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is refreshing to see that they're not just a patent troll.

661
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:17,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well moving on.

662
00:50:18,462 --> 00:50:19,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC Carrie-Anne Moss

663
00:50:45,683 --> 00:50:48,666
[SPEAKER_05]: She was also the mom in that Shia LaBeouf movie, and I saw that.

664
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:52,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I think she's in the new Silent Hill movie as well, actually.

665
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:52,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

666
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:56,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think she's one of the crazy... I think she plays the villainess, I think.

667
00:50:57,233 --> 00:50:57,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

668
00:50:57,473 --> 00:50:57,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hmm.

669
00:50:58,414 --> 00:51:00,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was the Borg queen last time?

670
00:51:00,075 --> 00:51:01,116
[SPEAKER_03]: This time it's Carrie Ann Moss.

671
00:51:01,416 --> 00:51:01,877
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

672
00:51:02,377 --> 00:51:12,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyhow, I suggest you do not fuck with Arya in the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC, which they are saying will be double the size of Leviathan.

673
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:17,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Leviathan wasn't that big of a DLC campaign though.

674
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It really wasn't.

675
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:23,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Lair of the Shadow Broker is still the one that they need to beat as far as quality and length.

676
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:29,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Lair of the Shadow Broker in Mass Effect 2 was a badass campaign from start to finish.

677
00:51:29,393 --> 00:51:30,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Lair of the Shadow Broker was great.

678
00:51:31,374 --> 00:51:36,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially if Omega is going to be kind of like a hub like the Shadow Broker Lair was that you got in 2.

679
00:51:36,815 --> 00:51:37,595
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

680
00:51:38,175 --> 00:52:00,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Omega was probably one of the best design places in the entire trilogy because if you're a science fiction geek like I am a lot of the design was based off of I'm blanking Harrison Ford in the 80s Blade Runner a lot of Omega is based a lot of off the scenes in Blade Runner and the music was amazing and I'm really glad that we're revisiting this place in three

681
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:07,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the big news about this DLC, female Turians for the first time you're going to see.

682
00:52:07,478 --> 00:52:10,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fans are wary.

683
00:52:10,462 --> 00:52:17,030
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always the comic books and so forth where they've shown up, but the first time in the game is certainly a big deal.

684
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:23,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the fans, of course, want to see, you know... When you say the fans, you mean who?

685
00:52:23,594 --> 00:52:25,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Tumblr, Bioware forums?

686
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,197
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that, the fandom.

687
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:34,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of people want to see female Turians because the entire trilogy... It's like, how do Turians have sex?

688
00:52:34,342 --> 00:52:35,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Because clearly they're all men everywhere.

689
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:43,709
[SPEAKER_05]: People are worried that they're just going to, like, put a Turian head on, like, Tits Armor and be like, there it is, like...

690
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:45,530
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fucking reptiles.

691
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,510
[SPEAKER_05]: They shouldn't have tits.

692
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, BioWare.

693
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm interested to see what they do.

694
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:54,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're talking about all of it, you've researched the fandom through extensive online research, right?

695
00:52:54,573 --> 00:52:55,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, yes.

696
00:52:56,014 --> 00:52:57,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I track Mass Effect tags on Tumblr.

697
00:52:57,755 --> 00:53:00,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And what sorts of things do you participate with in the fandom?

698
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:01,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I just reblog stuff and favorite stuff.

699
00:53:01,856 --> 00:53:03,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, have you ever written a fanfic?

700
00:53:03,297 --> 00:53:03,477
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

701
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:04,718
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

702
00:53:05,258 --> 00:53:06,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever read a fanfic?

703
00:53:07,999 --> 00:53:09,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I've read some hot Emshanko stuff.

704
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:13,789
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your favorite, M. Shinko?

705
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:29,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was Kaden was jogging through the Citadel in booty shorts, and everyone was like, you know, Cat calling him in Shepard was all flustered and offended.

706
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:32,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Kane's like, I don't know.

707
00:53:32,435 --> 00:53:33,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe you actually had an answer for that.

708
00:53:33,895 --> 00:53:34,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

709
00:53:34,675 --> 00:53:34,915
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

710
00:53:34,975 --> 00:53:38,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, just trolling you live on air.

711
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, also apparently about this new DLC, one of Mass Effect 2's characters, Zaid Massani, is supposed to return in this.

712
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember him being in 3.

713
00:53:51,221 --> 00:53:53,402
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he was in 1 Quest, wasn't he?

714
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:55,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's in the Quest with the little Volus from 1.

715
00:53:56,303 --> 00:53:57,103
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

716
00:53:57,343 --> 00:53:58,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's in the refugee camp.

717
00:53:58,504 --> 00:53:59,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You can talk to him.

718
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:00,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Zaid sucked anyway.

719
00:54:00,985 --> 00:54:01,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

720
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:02,165
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my opinion.

721
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:06,707
[SPEAKER_03]: $15 for the DLC, which is on the pricier end.

722
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:08,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

723
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:10,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that more than Shadowbroker was?

724
00:54:10,588 --> 00:54:12,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Was Shadowbroker $10 or was Shadowbroker also $15?

725
00:54:13,672 --> 00:54:14,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be 8 or 9 now.

726
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:16,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how much it was back in 2011.

727
00:54:42,973 --> 00:54:44,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had a bad experience

728
00:55:03,363 --> 00:55:03,943
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

729
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say, even though Cerberus took Omega, I'm sure there's a way to work it.

730
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:35,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cerberus... I'm getting so nerdy into the ending of 2.

731
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:40,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Cerberus took the remnants of the Collector base at the end of 2.

732
00:55:41,182 --> 00:55:42,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you blow it up, they still have it.

733
00:55:43,062 --> 00:55:47,263
[SPEAKER_05]: So they could be controlling the Collectors now, or the Collectors show up and ambush both of you and Cerberus.

734
00:55:47,664 --> 00:55:48,404
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, either way.

735
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:52,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Shayna Linko in chat says, they say that it's Cerberus, Rob, for Omega.

736
00:55:52,927 --> 00:55:54,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means nothing but Cerberus is going to show up?

737
00:55:55,809 --> 00:55:58,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but that could be the plot twist, that the Collectors are there, too.

738
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,033
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, all through 3, Arya talks about how it's Cerberus.

739
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:03,675
[SPEAKER_05]: The Elusive Man kicked her out, and she's pissed.

740
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:16,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, maybe some of these other weapons that have been showing up and so forth, and even maybe the maps, because multiplayer maps get used in single-player sometimes.

741
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:23,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, a lot of the multiplayer maps are unique to multiplayer though, now.

742
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:23,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Not originally.

743
00:56:25,101 --> 00:56:34,185
[SPEAKER_03]: But you definitely see some multiplayer map, or you see some single, like in the Leviathan DLC, I could have sworn one of those maps looked a lot like one of the multiplayer maps, but it was just kind of like different.

744
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a different layout, but kind of like the same assets.

745
00:56:38,266 --> 00:56:38,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

746
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:40,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, enough Mass Effect talk.

747
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:42,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's getting bored.

748
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:46,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I just totally tuned out that whole last segment.

749
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, hater, let's move on.

750
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll be more interested in what Alan has to say.

751
00:56:51,893 --> 00:56:53,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Darkstalkers?

752
00:56:54,114 --> 00:56:58,256
[SPEAKER_05]: 2D fighting game, really creative characters, really underrated franchise.

753
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:00,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Capcom is bringing it back.

754
00:57:01,098 --> 00:57:07,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Darkstalkers Resurrection was announced at New York Comic Con this past week, and it is a HD cleanup.

755
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:30,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Darkstalkers 2 and 3 and it's bundled together in one pack similar to Marvel vs. Capcom Origins and also if you remember the Final Fight Magic Sword combo where you can have it look like an arcade cabinet or you can have it be full screen it's going to be a package like one of those and it's going to be I think 1200 Microsoft points or $14.99

756
00:57:32,426 --> 00:57:35,007
[SPEAKER_05]: so yay Darkstalkers were you a fan of Darkstalkers?

757
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:54,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a modded Saturn, Sega Saturn and I imported Darkstalkers 3 because it used the 4 meg ram cart for the people that played X-Men vs Street Fighter on the Saturn if you remember that it supported the 4 meg ram cart, it was arcade perfect, it was gorgeous do you think you'll be picking this up?

758
00:57:56,232 --> 00:57:58,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna say no just because how often do I turn on the 360?

759
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:01,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

760
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:01,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

761
00:58:01,955 --> 00:58:05,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if they ever shut down the Mass Effect 3 servers, maybe you'll have a reason to.

762
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:06,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's possible.

763
00:58:09,681 --> 00:58:11,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 4, Xbox exclusive.

764
00:58:11,743 --> 00:58:12,343
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?

765
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:13,364
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do?

766
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:14,665
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

767
00:58:15,065 --> 00:58:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trolling them.

768
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:19,028
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought... Didn't they announce a new Darkstalkers game?

769
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:20,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Or was this all the announcement was?

770
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:24,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were teasing that something was going to happen.

771
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:26,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is that something.

772
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:29,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, I think it's trying to either get people...

773
00:58:30,077 --> 00:58:31,638
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

774
00:58:51,849 --> 00:59:10,419
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people don't realize, well, the real people who've been with Capcom since the beginning will know this, but the combo system used in X-Men vs. Street Fighter and the combo system used in Marvel vs. Capcom, you know, the light, light, medium, medium, hard, hard, where you do the zigzag across all six buttons, that chain combo system, that was done in Darkstalkers.

775
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:13,861
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the engine that they did that combo system in.

776
00:59:15,602 --> 00:59:16,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that also Killer Instinct?

777
00:59:16,883 --> 00:59:17,803
[SPEAKER_03]: You could kind of do that, too?

778
00:59:18,404 --> 00:59:19,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Zigzag combos?

779
00:59:19,384 --> 00:59:20,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were weird Link combos.

780
00:59:21,243 --> 00:59:22,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were very specific things you had to do.

781
00:59:22,943 --> 00:59:25,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you say zigzag combos with the six button, that's honestly what I think of.

782
00:59:25,824 --> 00:59:29,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of Killer Instinct before I think of that, but I get you.

783
00:59:30,725 --> 00:59:37,926
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some games coming out near you a little sooner than Darkstalkers, perhaps.

784
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with the US, Loki.

785
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:41,847
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so let's see here.

786
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:46,028
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, we have quite a few things coming out.

787
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:47,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting off with...

788
00:59:48,769 --> 01:00:13,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Rocksmith Guitar and Bass technically it's like the first game with the bass expansion but they've got that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC as well as bundled with an electric guitar Dance Central 3 coming out this week on Xbox 360 Mugen Souls on PlayStation 3 also let's see here

789
01:00:15,287 --> 01:00:25,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got 007 Legends on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

790
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:31,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Doom 3 BFG Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

791
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:35,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Zumba Fitness Core on the Wii and Xbox 360.

792
01:00:36,943 --> 01:00:45,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeopardy on PS3 and 360, Wheel of Fortune also on PS3 and 360, Silent Hill Book of Memories for the Vita.

793
01:00:45,865 --> 01:00:47,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that's been delayed forever.

794
01:00:48,366 --> 01:00:49,366
[SPEAKER_04]: That's finally coming out.

795
01:00:51,727 --> 01:00:53,007
[SPEAKER_03]: That was delayed quite a bit.

796
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:55,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I don't think it was very good from what I hear.

797
01:00:57,288 --> 01:00:58,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they made it better.

798
01:00:58,748 --> 01:00:59,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly hope so.

799
01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:01,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it's going to be kind of a disappointment.

800
01:01:03,435 --> 01:01:05,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm not used to them being a disappointment.

801
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what else.

802
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:18,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that one week from today, because they have to launch it on a Sunday because it's so special, Skylighter Giants coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and...

803
01:01:22,773 --> 01:01:23,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

804
01:01:24,134 --> 01:01:27,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're going to have a portal owners pack in case you bought the first game.

805
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:30,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that would be it.

806
01:01:31,878 --> 01:01:33,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's travel to Japan and look out there.

807
01:01:33,919 --> 01:01:35,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, wait, I want to read a comment from chat real quick.

808
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,804
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, when are they going to do a Rocksmith for keyboards?

809
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, keyboard smith.

810
01:01:44,225 --> 01:02:10,907
[SPEAKER_03]: if they do that I am so there like I'm not that interested in learning how to play guitar honestly but I used to play I used to play the organ like the double decker pianos with top and bottom I used to play that when I was younger like way younger like five to ten and I can still kind of hunt and peck my way around a piano or whatever but if they were to do this so I could like refine my skills I am so there if I could like you know because I really enjoy it in Rock Band 3 I really do

811
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:15,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the keyboard mania that they had for the actual keyboard that was on PC?

812
01:02:16,053 --> 01:02:16,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.

813
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:16,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

814
01:02:17,194 --> 01:02:19,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't own it, but... Or what about Rock Band?

815
01:02:19,515 --> 01:02:20,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you ever play Rock Band 3?

816
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:21,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I played Rock Band 3.

817
01:02:22,137 --> 01:02:23,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved the keyboard mode in Rock Band 3.

818
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:28,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then there was Keyboard Mania, of course, many years ago in Japan, and that was fun, too.

819
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:33,485
[SPEAKER_03]: That was always my favorite of the Moani games, even though it was horribly neglected.

820
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's go to Japan and check out some games coming out over there.

821
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:44,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Monster Hunter Frontier Online Forward 5 Premium Package on the Xbox 360 on the 17th.

822
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:52,513
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also, I guess there's a bundle with Xbox Live points you can get too, I guess for some of the transactions in the game.

823
01:02:52,553 --> 01:02:56,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think Monster Hunter Online for them is actually a monthly fee.

824
01:02:56,596 --> 01:02:59,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's probably a points recurring fee.

825
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:29,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Central 3 gets a Japanese release on October 18th Darksiders 2 gets a Japanese release on October 18th as does FIFA 13 World Class Soccer again those are all Xbox 360 for the few 360 owners in Japan interesting about Dance Central 3 I'm imagining it's got to be the same song list I don't think they localize for you know the area or whatever so I don't like don't get excited if you're a J-pop fan I don't think there's anything to look for there but interesting that they got such a quick turnaround

826
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:33,865
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very disappointing that they don't have Wild Wild West like they do in Just Dance 4.

827
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:42,833
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 and FIFA 13 also coming there on the PlayStation 3 on the 18th.

828
01:03:44,014 --> 01:03:45,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, going to some of the handhelds.

829
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:54,324
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Vita this week, FIFA 13 is there as well, and The Legend of Heroes Zero No Kisuke Evolution comes out on the PlayStation Vita.

830
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:55,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying, if you haven't bought

831
01:03:56,386 --> 01:04:00,193
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Vita version of FIFA 13, you may want to hold off.

832
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:01,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

833
01:04:02,257 --> 01:04:03,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's exactly the same as FIFA 12.

834
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:05,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought that was the Wii version.

835
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:06,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of them.

836
01:04:06,746 --> 01:04:07,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

837
01:04:08,973 --> 01:04:09,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards.

838
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:15,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Project X Zone on October 19th from Namco Bandai.

839
01:04:16,116 --> 01:04:16,776
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty awesome.

840
01:04:17,096 --> 01:04:18,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are your Japanese release dates.

841
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:24,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, would you care to take us to the land of all things Britain?

842
01:04:24,479 --> 01:04:24,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

843
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:25,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And UK-ish.

844
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:31,582
[SPEAKER_05]: October 15th has The War Z, or The War Zed, coming out on PC.

845
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:38,685
[SPEAKER_05]: October 17th we've got Serious Sam 3 BFE on Xbox 360 and The Unfinished Swan.

846
01:04:39,116 --> 01:05:01,836
[SPEAKER_05]: on PlayStation 3, 19th of October, 007 Legends on 360 and PS3, Dance Central 3 on the 360, Doom 3 BFG Edition on the 360, PS3, and PC, Madagascar 3, the video game, which I'm sure is going to be the best game released this year, because, you know, movie tie-in games are always phenomenal.

847
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:07,100
[SPEAKER_05]: on 360, PS3, DS, PC, 3DS, and Wii.

848
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Those big cross-platform juggernauts.

849
01:05:11,283 --> 01:05:12,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocksmith on PC.

850
01:05:12,904 --> 01:05:16,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Skylanders Giants on Wii, iPhone, 360, PS3, and PC.

851
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:19,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.

852
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:22,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is it.

853
01:05:23,431 --> 01:05:27,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few more news stories for you guys, then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

854
01:05:27,994 --> 01:05:30,916
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura isn't here, so we're taking over.

855
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,937
[SPEAKER_03]: So see what we picked in a minute.

856
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:34,138
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Loki.

857
01:05:35,019 --> 01:05:37,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently SingStar is going to be a free-to-play game pretty soon.

858
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:46,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Which kind of makes sense, because when you buy SingStar, you kind of get some songs, but it's basically just a platform to buy more songs.

859
01:05:46,386 --> 01:05:48,187
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at Rob's library, that shit ain't free.

860
01:05:48,648 --> 01:05:49,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

861
01:05:50,629 --> 01:06:02,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, don't be a jealous hater because I have SingStar ABBA, which is awesome, SingStar Queen, which is awesome, and SingStar 1 and 2 on the PlayStation 3, which are okay.

862
01:06:02,341 --> 01:06:04,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many songs a la carte that you've bought?

863
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:05,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough.

864
01:06:06,946 --> 01:06:08,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough to have a party.

865
01:06:08,207 --> 01:06:10,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough to entertain my guests when there's a SingStar.

866
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been collecting them since I lived at that house with John.

867
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:15,555
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really have parties here in the tiny apartment.

868
01:06:15,855 --> 01:06:20,260
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I lived in the house with John where OLR was in the garage studio, we used to have SingStar parties.

869
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,481
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a good time.

870
01:06:22,768 --> 01:06:24,589
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of those I bought on sale, to be fair.

871
01:06:24,629 --> 01:06:27,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I got SingStar Queen at the local flea market for like $8.

872
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,711
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you going to say no to that?

873
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:29,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was new.

874
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:32,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brand new, still wrapped.

875
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:36,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently you still need the microphone, obviously, to play the game.

876
01:06:37,315 --> 01:06:44,158
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess there is a message now popping up on the SingStar games.

877
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:49,200
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically saying the complete SingStar experience will be available as a free download very soon.

878
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:50,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

879
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:52,901
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

880
01:07:19,711 --> 01:07:21,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you don't like all of ABBA songs.

881
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:22,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you only like a couple.

882
01:07:22,653 --> 01:07:26,316
[SPEAKER_04]: You buy a couple ABBA songs and you buy some Britney Spears or something.

883
01:07:26,536 --> 01:07:27,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

884
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:31,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Who the fuck is going to be satisfied with only a couple of ABBA songs?

885
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,423
[SPEAKER_03]: If only a couple ABBA songs is what it takes to satisfy you, get out of here.

886
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:39,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe those people want to spend their money on Queen or something like that.

887
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:44,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, if you're on a limited income, then I understand.

888
01:07:44,909 --> 01:07:45,169
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

889
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:49,552
[SPEAKER_03]: But you need to set up your monthly ABBA plan to get you on your path.

890
01:07:51,993 --> 01:07:52,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

891
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:52,794
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

892
01:07:52,854 --> 01:07:53,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

893
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:56,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Good idea for Sony?

894
01:07:57,331 --> 01:07:58,452
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good idea.

895
01:07:58,613 --> 01:07:59,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well.

896
01:07:59,494 --> 01:08:01,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they haven't really done anything with SingStar in a while.

897
01:08:01,956 --> 01:08:07,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good idea because it's going to get more exposure for people and because the SingStar games don't really sell that well.

898
01:08:07,702 --> 01:08:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they really don't.

899
01:08:09,324 --> 01:08:09,884
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't?

900
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:11,185
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they don't.

901
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:14,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet they do overseas a lot better.

902
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:24,168
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably do overseas, but honestly, karaoke games don't do very well, but everybody's got a USB microphone, especially those wonderful Logitech microphones that they put in everything.

903
01:08:24,428 --> 01:08:26,129
[SPEAKER_04]: They work on pretty much all systems.

904
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:33,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get one of those in a throwaway game, like Truth or Lies or something like that.

905
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:34,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

906
01:08:34,953 --> 01:08:38,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got a SingStar mic.

907
01:08:38,455 --> 01:08:40,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, no, the SingStar mics are different.

908
01:08:40,896 --> 01:08:45,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, I mean, you could find a bundle for SingStar for like dirt cheap somewhere.

909
01:08:45,385 --> 01:08:48,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that like a GameStop or Walmart or something has them in their dump bin.

910
01:08:48,932 --> 01:08:50,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go looking for it.

911
01:08:53,280 --> 01:09:09,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's move on to one more story about, you know, this always pisses people off when there's content on the disc that they call DLC, and you have to pay to unlock it, which, you know, we started using the term pay to unlock content instead of DLC for certain things.

912
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:18,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when it was discovered that Resident Evil 6 has some things locked away on the disc, everybody was like, oh, here we go again, Capcom!

913
01:09:19,087 --> 01:09:20,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay to unlock DLC!

914
01:09:21,568 --> 01:09:21,888
[SPEAKER_03]: But...

915
01:09:22,808 --> 01:09:38,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently Capcom announced that the things that were found on the disc, including No Hope, Difficulty Level, and Co-op for Ada Wong's campaign, these will be freebies, and they will be a free title update coming soon.

916
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:42,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So no word if they only made it free because they got caught, or...

917
01:09:43,252 --> 01:09:57,484
[SPEAKER_03]: All trolling aside, I can see the value of doing free DLC because it extends the life of your game past the first week, especially in the very busy holiday season where there are so many games competing for your attention.

918
01:09:58,825 --> 01:10:01,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I can actually see the value of this.

919
01:10:02,228 --> 01:10:07,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but good on Capcom in this case.

920
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:12,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it is coming out that there will be paid DLC, but it will not already be on the disc.

921
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming later.

922
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:37,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Alright.

923
01:10:38,979 --> 01:10:44,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on to a time when there wasn't even a Resident Evil 1 yet.

924
01:10:44,363 --> 01:10:46,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think when this game originally came out.

925
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:47,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one was out.

926
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:48,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

927
01:10:48,146 --> 01:10:48,467
[SPEAKER_03]: There was.

928
01:10:48,647 --> 01:10:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a 1.

929
01:10:49,327 --> 01:10:49,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

930
01:10:51,069 --> 01:10:51,609
[SPEAKER_03]: But, okay.

931
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when the Resident Evil series was good...

932
01:10:55,222 --> 01:10:56,423
[SPEAKER_03]: It was no download content.

933
01:10:56,443 --> 01:10:57,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all on this content.

934
01:10:57,264 --> 01:10:57,684
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

935
01:10:57,724 --> 01:10:59,485
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no download content.

936
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:01,367
[SPEAKER_05]: When Resident Evil 2 was going to be on the N64.

937
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:02,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that?

938
01:11:02,588 --> 01:11:03,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

939
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:03,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

940
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:06,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a classic game of the week.

941
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:08,373
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, she ain't here again.

942
01:11:08,773 --> 01:11:10,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've snatched her pick away from her.

943
01:11:11,275 --> 01:11:15,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've picked an awesome game in her place that we think you guys should be playing this week.

944
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And we gave it to Alan this week.

945
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So Alan, what is your classic game of the week?

946
01:11:20,102 --> 01:11:20,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,

947
01:11:20,562 --> 01:11:46,657
[SPEAKER_05]: usually when I do this segment I do like old Sierra Online PC games or like LucasArts so I wanted to give consoles love this time and I wanted to do something handheld because I don't think handheld gets that much love in this segment so I chose Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages for the Game Boy Color

948
01:11:48,323 --> 01:11:49,364
[SPEAKER_05]: They are super awesome.

949
01:11:51,685 --> 01:12:04,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of Zelda Seasons and Ages came out together, obviously, because you can play one, you get this huge, massive password code that you then plug into the next game, and then you continue the story.

950
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:17,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you beat both of the games, so you play one, you get your code, you play the other one, then you get to fight Ganon, who's the secret boss, and then you get to see Zelda proper, and you get the real ending.

951
01:12:18,823 --> 01:12:28,250
[SPEAKER_05]: and one of the big deals about this game was the fact that Nintendo did not develop or design it.

952
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:36,396
[SPEAKER_05]: They let a subsidiary of Capcom called Flagship write and code and design the game and Nintendo simply published it.

953
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:41,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that may be one of the first times Nintendo has ever let a blue chip franchise

954
01:12:43,487 --> 01:12:44,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Be in the Hands of Someone Else.

955
01:12:44,849 --> 01:12:52,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's not that rare, because Sega's done stuff, and there was that Metroid game that was done by Team Ninja.

956
01:12:52,437 --> 01:12:58,463
[SPEAKER_05]: This game came out in the US in May of 2001, which was the month of

957
01:13:00,385 --> 01:13:03,807
[SPEAKER_05]: before the Game Boy Advance console proper came out.

958
01:13:03,987 --> 01:13:10,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one of the last games for the Game Boy Color before that generation was phased down, the Advance took over.

959
01:13:10,451 --> 01:13:18,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the best Game Boy Color graphics that you'll probably ever see, and even looking on the YouTube, that looks pretty good.

960
01:13:20,757 --> 01:13:22,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like eight colors, I think, on the Game Boy Color?

961
01:13:22,839 --> 01:13:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

962
01:13:24,259 --> 01:13:30,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so if you play one game, some of the items that you get are upgradable in the second game.

963
01:13:31,143 --> 01:13:36,065
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of little side quests and little... Look at these little cartoony cutscenes, too.

964
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:36,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

965
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:37,245
[SPEAKER_03]: For Game Boy Color.

966
01:13:37,345 --> 01:13:38,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

967
01:13:41,255 --> 01:14:00,356
[SPEAKER_05]: If you play both games, depending on which order you play them in, you can upgrade certain items to a tier that you couldn't normally get if you bring all of your equipment and stuff over into the next game.

968
01:14:01,456 --> 01:14:12,060
[SPEAKER_05]: In Oracle of Ages there is a time mechanic where you speed up time or slow down time to get past to solve certain puzzles in the dungeons or on the overworld to actually get into the dungeon.

969
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:20,863
[SPEAKER_05]: In Oracle of Seasons you have a rod that will if there's a river you'll make it winter and the water will freeze so you can cross the river.

970
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff like that.

971
01:14:23,104 --> 01:14:27,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this the game that had the advanced dungeons or was that one of the other Game Boy games?

972
01:14:27,265 --> 01:14:29,906
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Link's Awakening DX wasn't it?

973
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:31,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

974
01:14:53,672 --> 01:14:54,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

975
01:14:54,672 --> 01:14:58,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're thinking of the re-release of Link's Awakening.

976
01:14:58,213 --> 01:14:58,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I am.

977
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in chat will correct me.

978
01:15:00,514 --> 01:15:02,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the lovely part of doing a live show.

979
01:15:03,155 --> 01:15:22,581
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the awesome things about the Legend of Zelda handheld games is that, and Nintendo, Miyamoto's even come out and said this, in the handheld Zelda games, they will allow themselves to do things with the franchise and with the mechanics and the story that they simply can't do on the console versions, because the console ones...

980
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:23,522
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

981
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:43,915
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the three medallions, you're always going to have the Master Sword, you're always going to fight Ganon.

982
01:15:43,935 --> 01:15:47,796
[SPEAKER_05]: There are these staple things that are always in those games.

983
01:15:47,976 --> 01:16:02,359
[SPEAKER_05]: In the handheld ones, like Oracle of Seasons and Ages, Minish Cap, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, that's when they really get super creative with the world of Hyrule and the stuff that you can do.

984
01:16:02,999 --> 01:16:07,180
[SPEAKER_05]: They usually introduce a lot of new characters that you'll never really see again in the handheld games.

985
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:16,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Link's Awakening, with the big, you know, the fish or whatever that's sleeping, that whole plot was inspired by Twin Peaks.

986
01:16:18,184 --> 01:16:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know it?

987
01:16:18,704 --> 01:16:20,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're a big Twin Peaks fan, right?

988
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:20,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do.

989
01:16:20,905 --> 01:16:25,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so that's just, yeah, that's just an example of how the...

990
01:16:26,755 --> 01:16:54,418
[SPEAKER_03]: how Zelda really shines in a lot of unique ways on the handheld systems now I did some research and the advanced shop was Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons it was a shop it was not a dungeon I think I called it the advanced dungeon at first that's probably what confused you when these games are played on a Game Boy Advance there is a shop they have two seed rings and a gasha seed depending on the game it's either the GBA time ring or the GBA nature ring while the other is a random ring

991
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:58,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, and oh, that's right, I remember it's right here in the article.

992
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:07,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Since this was so close to the Game Boy Advance release, if you played it on the Advance in addition to that shop, the graphics were also much improved.

993
01:17:07,505 --> 01:17:18,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had, obviously not Game Boy Advance quality graphics, but the color palette and the clarity of the pixels, they actually was coded onto the Game Boy Color cartridge to be read by the Advance.

994
01:17:18,452 --> 01:17:18,952
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

995
01:17:21,145 --> 01:17:26,588
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look this up on YouTube, try to find the advanced run-throughs.

996
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:30,770
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as how it played, again, it's Legend of Zelda.

997
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:48,819
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've played Minish Cap, Link to the Past, the first Zelda game, overhead, big expansive map, you go into dungeons, you have to beat the dungeons in a certain order, because the items that you get in the dungeon, the treasure, is what you'll need to solve puzzles in the dungeons.

998
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:50,861
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so forth.

999
01:17:51,881 --> 01:17:56,585
[SPEAKER_05]: The main antagonists, I believe, are Twinrova.

1000
01:17:56,606 --> 01:17:58,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the double witches could be wrong there.

1001
01:17:58,727 --> 01:18:00,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been so long since I played this.

1002
01:18:01,249 --> 01:18:02,130
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there are these...

1003
01:18:04,332 --> 01:18:08,836
[SPEAKER_05]: The oracles are these ladies that you meet when you're transported to these new worlds.

1004
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:12,440
[SPEAKER_05]: These games don't take place in Hyrule like a lot of the handheld games.

1005
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:19,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they are in danger, and there's... Naru is one, and Din, I think, is the other one.

1006
01:18:20,307 --> 01:18:29,696
[SPEAKER_05]: So you rescue them, and then as you progress through, you beat the one game and you play the other one, you do figure out finally how Zelda and Ganon and the Triforce factor into it.

1007
01:18:30,597 --> 01:18:34,630
[SPEAKER_05]: they're a lot of fun if you're a big Zelda fan and you haven't played these you're missing out

1008
01:18:35,498 --> 01:18:35,798
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1009
01:18:35,858 --> 01:18:36,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Good pick.

1010
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:40,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Your classic game of the week, The Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Ages, and Oracle of Seasons.

1011
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Two games for the price of one.

1012
01:18:43,201 --> 01:18:43,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1013
01:18:43,921 --> 01:18:44,201
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1014
01:18:44,281 --> 01:18:45,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Alan.

1015
01:18:45,122 --> 01:18:45,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Good pick.

1016
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:47,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Jamie would be happy.

1017
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:48,883
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1018
01:18:48,903 --> 01:18:50,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's going to do it for part A of our show.

1019
01:18:50,784 --> 01:18:51,384
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't go anywhere.

1020
01:18:51,424 --> 01:19:00,307
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got plenty more show to come when we get back, including some rapid-fire news, the Fugo question of the week, and some interesting rumors about Miyamoto's new direction.

1021
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:00,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1022
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:01,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

1023
01:19:02,268 --> 01:19:05,851
[SPEAKER_03]: An event coming up appropriately named Fuck This Jam.

1024
01:19:05,951 --> 01:19:06,772
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that.

1025
01:19:06,812 --> 01:19:07,552
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not our event.

1026
01:19:07,592 --> 01:19:08,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's somebody else's.

1027
01:19:08,553 --> 01:19:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that a little more when we come back after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1028
01:19:19,545 --> 01:19:21,166
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1029
01:19:42,659 --> 01:19:43,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Outro Music Outro Music

1030
01:20:07,367 --> 01:20:08,007
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't see it?

1031
01:20:08,588 --> 01:20:12,370
[SPEAKER_05]: When they did the galloping horse, it blew my fucking mind.

1032
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:14,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it was really amazing some of the stuff they were doing.

1033
01:20:14,872 --> 01:20:24,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you know, having done field shows in the past before, and I'm sure Bobby can attest to this too, I'm sure we're not the only band nerds that happen to be into video games and all that.

1034
01:20:24,518 --> 01:20:27,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's plenty more band nerds out there listening to this show.

1035
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:34,444
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is a lot of work, because you not only have to memorize songs, but you have to memorize where on the field you're going.

1036
01:20:34,965 --> 01:20:35,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not...

1037
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:36,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1038
01:20:56,297 --> 01:21:25,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica Harper from Under Station Live is in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and says I was however the drum major my senior year I feel like she's told me that before and I forgot and that's awesome because I tried out to be drum major but I wasn't picked somebody else was picked I'm a drum major reject and now look at me I'm on a podcast about video games on the internet anyhow drum major reject laughs

1039
01:21:25,538 --> 01:21:27,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad Jessica could achieve where I clearly failed miserably

1040
01:21:36,314 --> 01:21:40,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I apologize again for my voice, you guys.

1041
01:21:40,498 --> 01:21:42,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kind of struggling through tonight's show.

1042
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:52,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already had a hot cup of coffee and a throat coke cup of tea, and it'll fix it for about 30 seconds, and then I go back to, my voice is kind of scratchy.

1043
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:53,829
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will do my best.

1044
01:21:53,849 --> 01:22:01,816
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the worst possible thing that can happen to a radio guy, but I will do my best to try to get through the next couple hours here, or not next couple hours, but next hour or so.

1045
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:07,478
[SPEAKER_03]: of the show for you guys because we have plenty more gaming news to talk about.

1046
01:22:07,498 --> 01:22:09,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news, right, Loki?

1047
01:22:10,278 --> 01:22:11,159
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

1048
01:22:11,799 --> 01:22:16,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk a little bit about this really cool sale that they've got on Amazon right now.

1049
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:20,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bunch of Square Enix games, and I think it's a great deal.

1050
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:29,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $10, and you basically get Deus Ex Human Revolution Augmented Edition plus the Missing Link DLC, Hitman Blood Money, Just Cause 2, Just Cause,

1051
01:22:29,922 --> 01:22:35,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Quantum Conundrum, Supreme Commander 2, and The Last Remnant for $10.

1052
01:22:36,186 --> 01:22:39,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sale is running through October 20th.

1053
01:22:39,928 --> 01:22:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It expires at 11.59 p.m.

1054
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:43,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Standard Time.

1055
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:48,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So go get it because, I mean, that's seriously a great price.

1056
01:22:48,533 --> 01:22:53,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is a sale we were referring to in Part A, and I got to say, kind of want, actually.

1057
01:22:53,476 --> 01:22:57,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's called the Absolutely Great Square Pack from Amazon.

1058
01:22:57,498 --> 01:23:19,632
[SPEAKER_05]: and these are all the PC yeah the last remnant which you know was their exclusive RPG for the 360 which was a huge pile of shit if you have a good PC it plays fine so the technical issues that it had on the 360 are on PC and you should actually play that game because it's good and no one would ever know because it was so awful on the 360 so Overlooked Square RPG

1059
01:23:20,519 --> 01:23:23,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft in our chatroom says Amazon won't let me buy it.

1060
01:23:23,341 --> 01:23:25,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that's the Mexico thing.

1061
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:28,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a deal that's only good in the US.

1062
01:23:29,163 --> 01:23:32,345
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of sucks for those that are in other countries.

1063
01:23:32,405 --> 01:23:33,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1064
01:23:33,846 --> 01:23:34,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what else to say.

1065
01:23:34,906 --> 01:23:35,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.

1066
01:23:36,067 --> 01:23:38,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what?

1067
01:23:38,328 --> 01:23:39,508
[SPEAKER_04]: It may not be available anymore.

1068
01:23:39,528 --> 01:23:40,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It says currently unavailable.

1069
01:23:41,669 --> 01:23:42,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it sold out.

1070
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe so many people jumped on it.

1071
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,571
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing, too.

1072
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:46,751
[SPEAKER_04]: This is weird.

1073
01:23:47,031 --> 01:23:51,393
[SPEAKER_04]: The DRM on it was Steam, so you were getting some sort of codes or something.

1074
01:23:52,373 --> 01:23:53,494
[SPEAKER_05]: For a lot of games.

1075
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:54,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, wait.

1076
01:23:54,674 --> 01:23:55,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it right here.

1077
01:23:55,434 --> 01:23:56,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I'm sorry.

1078
01:23:56,535 --> 01:24:00,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It says unavailable, but then there was this buy and download thing.

1079
01:24:01,057 --> 01:24:03,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try clicking that just out of curiosity.

1080
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:04,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Just come on.

1081
01:24:06,078 --> 01:24:07,199
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

1082
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:36,734
[SPEAKER_05]: uh no it will not let me during some of Steam's really insane you know 99 cent sales this happened with GTA 4 and um the you know Ballad of Gay Tony they had a note um we don't have codes so we ran out of all our codes so we have to contact Rockstar Games for like 20,000 more codes that could be the issue that's happening here well they may have had limited copies and then once they hit all the blocks and well that sucks

1083
01:24:39,016 --> 01:24:49,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananogram in chat is saying, don't know if Loki said, but feel free to use the code SQRLUVIO to take $2 off any digital video games purchase.

1084
01:24:49,883 --> 01:24:53,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Code will expire when this product becomes available for purchase again.

1085
01:24:53,805 --> 01:24:57,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if that means Amazon didn't intend for this to happen or something weird's going on.

1086
01:24:58,548 --> 01:24:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have that code either.

1087
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:01,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Very strange.

1088
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:01,870
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't give me any code.

1089
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,191
[SPEAKER_04]: These bastards.

1090
01:25:03,471 --> 01:25:04,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1091
01:25:05,052 --> 01:25:05,332
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1092
01:25:06,033 --> 01:25:08,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I bet you're mad for waiting now.

1093
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:09,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1094
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:10,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Check tomorrow.

1095
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:11,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I do see that.

1096
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it says currently out of keys, back in stock soon, $2 promo.

1097
01:25:15,118 --> 01:25:15,898
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1098
01:25:16,018 --> 01:25:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

1099
01:25:16,499 --> 01:25:17,419
[SPEAKER_04]: There's right, yay.

1100
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1101
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:24,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, just give it some time and keep checking back, I guess.

1102
01:25:25,284 --> 01:25:27,485
[SPEAKER_04]: But, oh, well, great deal either way.

1103
01:25:29,269 --> 01:25:29,629
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1104
01:25:29,809 --> 01:25:35,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, we have to talk a little bit about some DLC and Sleeping Dogs.

1105
01:25:35,376 --> 01:25:37,358
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have quite a bit of DLC soon.

1106
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:42,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting next week, they're getting some street racing DLC.

1107
01:25:42,163 --> 01:25:46,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to add some new street races in the game, I guess, for $4.

1108
01:25:47,149 --> 01:25:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it's going to run you.

1109
01:25:49,051 --> 01:25:51,453
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have three new races across Land and Sea.

1110
01:25:52,314 --> 01:26:00,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I guess, there's some new Street Racer DLC that they're... I guess they're adding a new motorcycle as well.

1111
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,464
[SPEAKER_04]: And a new outfit that boosts, I guess, Defense Against Gunfire and Accidents.

1112
01:26:07,164 --> 01:26:11,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's also going to be some DLC on the 30th that's...

1113
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:14,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Nightmare in Northport

1114
01:26:39,798 --> 01:26:40,579
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1115
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:00,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1116
01:27:28,775 --> 01:27:34,161
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, if you played Borderlands 1 and played all the DLC in it, you know it's going to be good.

1117
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:38,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that the DLC will be pretty awesome.

1118
01:27:38,446 --> 01:27:45,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still waiting to hear on how it goes and maybe I'll have to plunk down the $30 for a season pass.

1119
01:27:46,721 --> 01:27:48,062
[SPEAKER_03]: XCOM Enemy Unknown

1120
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:08,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a pretty nifty Easter egg in the game that allows you to bring in super soldiers.

1121
01:28:08,761 --> 01:28:12,904
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put in certain names and they activate XCOM heroes.

1122
01:28:13,505 --> 01:28:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1123
01:28:13,825 --> 01:28:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, it makes me think of NBA Jam when you could put in certain combinations that would unlock Bill Clinton and Scorpion and shit.

1124
01:28:21,433 --> 01:28:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1125
01:28:22,133 --> 01:28:22,994
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

1126
01:28:23,114 --> 01:28:23,955
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1127
01:28:24,275 --> 01:28:26,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the type of people you can unlock here.

1128
01:28:27,518 --> 01:28:28,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Sid Meier.

1129
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:54,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Levine I think that's awesome that they put Sid Meier in there Joe Kelly and Otto Zander are apparently all super soldiers so far apparently the one little trick to it is that once you summon the heroes the achievements are turned off so if you want to go for achievements don't use this little cheat but maybe once you've beat the game and got the achievements you want go back and play as Sid Meier for the lols

1130
01:28:56,707 --> 01:28:57,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1131
01:29:17,098 --> 01:29:44,520
[SPEAKER_03]: he's teamed up with an animator friend to make Street Fighter 3 for Inkazon it's a fan flick and it looks really really nice especially in these little posters it looks like even better than like I don't like Frankenweenie or one of those movies that's like in theaters it's a really neat art style kind of impressive that it's only these two guys even more impressive that Capcom hasn't shut it down yet but maybe the fact that they are in Brazil makes it complicated

1132
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck to them.

1133
01:30:07,036 --> 01:30:15,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Much like animals in the real world, Pokemon are treated as unfeeling objects and used for things as human entertainment and as subjects in experiments.

1134
01:30:15,759 --> 01:30:28,864
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the Pokemon are stuffed into Pokeballs is similar to how circuses chain elephants inside railroad cars and let them out only to perform confusing and awful painful tricks that were taught using sharp steel-tipped bullhooks and electric shock prods.

1135
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:35,071
[SPEAKER_03]: If PETA existed in UNOVA, our motto would be, Pokemon are not ours to use or abuse.

1136
01:30:35,391 --> 01:30:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: They exist for their own reasons.

1137
01:30:37,214 --> 01:30:39,777
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that this is the message that should be sent to children.

1138
01:30:40,996 --> 01:30:47,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I just want to remind you guys, PETA is clearly trolling with this.

1139
01:30:48,262 --> 01:30:49,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that statement.

1140
01:30:50,343 --> 01:30:54,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Over half of the statement had nothing to do with the game they were putting out.

1141
01:30:54,707 --> 01:30:59,531
[SPEAKER_03]: They used half that statement to talk about the whole circus and the elephants and all that stuff.

1142
01:31:00,271 --> 01:31:25,747
[SPEAKER_03]: it is all about attention I mean clearly they play Pokemon they understand Pokemon because they know about like the Pokemon world they said if PETA existed in Unova they didn't say if PETA existed in the Pokemon universe or if PETA ruled Nintendo these people know what the fuck they're doing by getting attention congratulations you picked the right week to do it at least if nothing else Alan

1143
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:35,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I played PETA's Cooking Mama game from Thanksgiving, and whoever they contract to do their Shockwave games, some of them are actually kind of good.

1144
01:31:35,885 --> 01:31:45,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That almost is the reason why these things are worth covering, because as much as they are troll-y and it's like you just roll your eyes at PETA, they're high-quality trolls.

1145
01:31:49,331 --> 01:31:54,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because the Cooking Mama one was how to make like a tofurkey in the like vegan Thanksgiving.

1146
01:31:54,613 --> 01:31:56,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you click and drag the food ingredients.

1147
01:31:56,313 --> 01:31:59,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, this is a pretty well done little shockwave game.

1148
01:32:00,555 --> 01:32:00,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1149
01:32:02,815 --> 01:32:04,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember playing on the Genesis ToeJam & Earl?

1150
01:32:05,865 --> 01:32:16,615
[SPEAKER_05]: because I do, the sequel, ToeJam & Earl, and Panic on Funkatron are going to hit the PSN and XBLA online stores on November 6th and 7th, respectively.

1151
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:24,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I never played this because I was, at the time, I was at the age where I was really kind of butthurt.

1152
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:31,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's a 2D side-scrolling platformer, and the original ToeJam & Earl was like an overhead sort of adventure game.

1153
01:32:32,729 --> 01:32:58,539
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh so yeah if you're a fan of Toa Jam and Earl and want some vintage uh Genesis nostalgia pick that up November 6th and 7th uh God of War Ascension which is the next God of War game because you know they're not going to let that franchise die off the demo is going to be in the Total Recall remake the one with Colin whatever his name is um uh that comes out on

1154
01:33:00,299 --> 01:33:01,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy, December 18th.

1155
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:04,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So get the Total Recall Blu-ray Play God of War Ascension.

1156
01:33:04,980 --> 01:33:09,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is going to be the only way to get that demo until four days before the game comes out.

1157
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:15,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I think like March 8th is when they're putting the demo on PSN and then the game comes out on March 12th of next year.

1158
01:33:16,543 --> 01:33:22,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And the graphics for it, just looking at these screenshots, look really like disgustingly awesome.

1159
01:33:23,277 --> 01:33:24,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Very God of War-ish.

1160
01:33:24,418 --> 01:33:24,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1161
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, the game Injustice Gods Among Us, which I will admit I don't really know much about.

1162
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:33,963
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being put out by NetherRealm.

1163
01:33:35,725 --> 01:33:37,265
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a DC Comics character in it.

1164
01:33:37,366 --> 01:33:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Green Arrow, who some people might remember, like, you know, the show Supernatural, which finally ended after, like, 11 seasons that had Green Arrow in it.

1165
01:33:45,090 --> 01:33:47,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Green Arrow I think that's best known.

1166
01:33:47,892 --> 01:33:49,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, Supernatural's not done.

1167
01:33:49,312 --> 01:33:50,233
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still on the air, isn't it?

1168
01:33:50,293 --> 01:33:51,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I meant Smallville.

1169
01:33:51,313 --> 01:33:51,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1170
01:33:51,894 --> 01:33:53,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Smallville, Superman.

1171
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:56,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's an Arrow series on CW.

1172
01:33:56,716 --> 01:33:58,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Either it just started last week or it's starting this week.

1173
01:33:58,937 --> 01:33:59,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is it a spinoff?

1174
01:33:59,758 --> 01:34:00,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same actor?

1175
01:34:00,518 --> 01:34:03,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think they're trying to make Smallville lightning strike twice.

1176
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:04,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1177
01:34:06,001 --> 01:34:08,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, Green Arrow is going to be a character in Injustice Gods Among Us.

1178
01:34:10,083 --> 01:34:10,443
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1179
01:34:11,638 --> 01:34:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it's the Justice League outfit, I believe, from the Cartoon Network show.

1180
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:19,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Shayna Linko in chat says, different actor, sadly.

1181
01:34:20,202 --> 01:34:21,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, that's just unfortunate.

1182
01:34:23,063 --> 01:34:24,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat.

1183
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:26,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go back to the PETA thing for a minute.

1184
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:28,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, they're delayed, so sometimes it takes time for them to comment on things.

1185
01:34:29,426 --> 01:34:32,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder what PETA thinks of Tokyo Jungle.

1186
01:34:33,248 --> 01:34:36,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't they hate the fact that you play as animals eating other animals?

1187
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:47,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is proof that they're trolling because, you know, obviously Tokyo Jungle is the game to take issue with, but they know that Tokyo Jungle is a niche thing.

1188
01:34:47,215 --> 01:34:50,857
[SPEAKER_03]: No one care about Tokyo Jungle, but what's a game that everybody talks about?

1189
01:34:51,077 --> 01:34:51,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon.

1190
01:34:52,298 --> 01:34:54,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'm giving this story far too much attention.

1191
01:34:54,459 --> 01:34:57,561
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to address that comment because it was worth commenting on.

1192
01:34:57,581 --> 01:35:07,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they really have a problem with people or with animals eating other animals because that just happens in the wild, but as long as it's not people eating other animals, that's really the issue there.

1193
01:35:08,163 --> 01:35:14,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So by that logic, would they be okay with people eating other people?

1194
01:35:15,317 --> 01:35:18,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because they're only for the ethical treatment of animals.

1195
01:35:18,684 --> 01:35:19,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing about people.

1196
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:20,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1197
01:35:20,919 --> 01:35:21,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to make sure that was clear.

1198
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:26,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, pet doesn't exist.

1199
01:35:26,283 --> 01:35:28,665
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a people for the ethical treatment of people.

1200
01:35:28,985 --> 01:35:29,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we need.

1201
01:35:29,686 --> 01:35:36,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the foundation we really... I sound like such an asshole because it sounds like I'm saying fuck animals and that's not really what I'm saying.

1202
01:35:37,612 --> 01:35:42,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we should have a... What about how we treat each other?

1203
01:35:42,877 --> 01:35:44,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that important as well?

1204
01:35:45,619 --> 01:35:45,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow...

1205
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, giving it far too much credit.

1206
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:51,242
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what deserves more credit on our show?

1207
01:35:52,102 --> 01:35:54,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities.

1208
01:35:56,544 --> 01:35:58,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Foogle question of the week.

1209
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Take Facebook and Google and put it together and you get Foogle.

1210
01:36:02,386 --> 01:36:03,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question of the week this week.

1211
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:09,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a little play on the fact that I've been on vacation for a little bit.

1212
01:36:10,915 --> 01:36:13,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's done it at some point in their life or another.

1213
01:36:13,558 --> 01:36:18,863
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the worst thing you've missed in real life so you can stay at home and play a video game?

1214
01:36:19,364 --> 01:36:21,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Did work get in the way of a Final Fantasy launch?

1215
01:36:22,247 --> 01:36:26,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you stay at home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of going to your friend's birthday party?

1216
01:36:27,952 --> 01:36:29,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, hiccup, bad time.

1217
01:36:30,894 --> 01:36:32,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst nightmare for a radio person.

1218
01:36:32,655 --> 01:36:36,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you stay home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of going to your friend's birthday party?

1219
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:40,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to some of the answers on Google, starting with Actdeft.

1220
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't recall missing anything serious for a video game.

1221
01:36:43,181 --> 01:36:48,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I have come close, though, like almost missing class to get a Dreamcast on Black Friday.

1222
01:36:48,404 --> 01:36:50,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, I'm from Mexico and we don't have Thanksgiving here.

1223
01:36:51,446 --> 01:36:51,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1224
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:09,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean F replied on Google Plus.

1225
01:37:09,671 --> 01:37:11,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there are people on Google Plus.

1226
01:37:12,113 --> 01:37:13,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say that every week.

1227
01:37:13,654 --> 01:37:22,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And said, I wish I had a terrible secret to reveal, but I think the worst I ever did was I took the day off in 2005 when I got a PSP at midnight release.

1228
01:37:22,681 --> 01:37:24,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Wipe out pure and luminous.

1229
01:37:24,643 --> 01:37:25,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

1230
01:37:26,805 --> 01:37:27,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed, good times.

1231
01:37:28,866 --> 01:37:32,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to Facebook and get some answers to the question there in our Facebook community.

1232
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off with

1233
01:37:39,197 --> 01:37:52,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Critical Myth says, I've been far more likely to miss things like company Christmas parties to see Lord of the Rings premieres, but a friend of mine skipped his own performance review to stand in line for the 360.

1234
01:37:53,273 --> 01:37:54,575
[SPEAKER_03]: He still got promoted.

1235
01:37:56,141 --> 01:37:58,342
[SPEAKER_03]: skipped his performance review at work to get a 360.

1236
01:37:58,382 --> 01:37:59,722
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good one.

1237
01:37:59,762 --> 01:38:03,663
[SPEAKER_03]: He must have known he was going to get a good review and could get away with murder with his boss.

1238
01:38:04,403 --> 01:38:10,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Degenerated Johnny, excuse me, says, I was leading my first raid in Molten Core during Vanilla WoW.

1239
01:38:10,965 --> 01:38:15,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the raid was during the time I was supposed to pick my mother up from the airport.

1240
01:38:16,307 --> 01:38:19,288
[SPEAKER_03]: She was coming back from a trip to her homeland of Scotland.

1241
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:23,549
[SPEAKER_03]: This resulted with her being stuck at the airport for two hours.

1242
01:38:24,389 --> 01:38:25,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it was through force, right?

1243
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:26,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Haseo Summer...

1244
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:48,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, sorry guys, the voice is going.

1245
01:38:48,312 --> 01:38:49,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Haseo Sumiragawa says,

1246
01:39:13,048 --> 01:39:17,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Tetsuya says, I actually skipped school the day I got the original PlayStation.

1247
01:39:17,512 --> 01:39:21,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Ironically, ran into my high school tutor at the time, who didn't seem to mind.

1248
01:39:21,395 --> 01:39:22,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did graduate.

1249
01:39:23,356 --> 01:39:26,659
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, Chiggers on Facebook says, never happened.

1250
01:39:27,499 --> 01:39:30,121
[SPEAKER_03]: In real life is always more important than a game.

1251
01:39:30,542 --> 01:39:34,945
[SPEAKER_03]: The game will always be there, but real life experience only happens once.

1252
01:39:36,688 --> 01:39:39,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh you, what a party pooper answer.

1253
01:39:40,434 --> 01:39:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1254
01:39:41,777 --> 01:39:43,740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we probably should remember.

1255
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody in here with a story to share?

1256
01:39:45,382 --> 01:39:48,027
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the worst thing you skipped out on in real life to play a video game?

1257
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:48,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan?

1258
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:56,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I did some all-nighters when I was in high school where I just didn't go to bed.

1259
01:39:56,872 --> 01:40:01,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I just played a game and then when it was time to go to school, I went to school because when you're 16, 17, you can do that shit.

1260
01:40:01,694 --> 01:40:06,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Your body's like, fine, I'll be up for, you know, 36 hours until eventually you can crash.

1261
01:40:07,636 --> 01:40:18,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as missing, I mean, when the PS2 came out, I went to bed at like 8 in the evening, got up at 1 or 2 in the morning,

1262
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:24,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I walked, I think, two or three miles to Target, got in line at Target at like 4 a.m.

1263
01:40:26,746 --> 01:40:27,667
[SPEAKER_05]: There was already a line.

1264
01:40:27,807 --> 01:40:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I got PS2, I think, 38 out of 43, so my timing couldn't have been any more flawless from wanting to actually avoid camping the entire night out.

1265
01:40:38,536 --> 01:40:39,556
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went into work.

1266
01:40:40,397 --> 01:40:46,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Once I actually bought the thing, I think I was in the office by, I want to say, 10 or 11 in the morning, but I already cleared it with my boss the night before, so...

1267
01:40:48,362 --> 01:40:50,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never done anything that scandalous.

1268
01:40:51,784 --> 01:40:53,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really think I've taken it.

1269
01:40:53,726 --> 01:40:56,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Have I taken a day off work to play a game?

1270
01:40:57,949 --> 01:40:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: If I did, I honestly do not remember.

1271
01:41:00,538 --> 01:41:24,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a day off work to play World of Warcraft but to be fair I ended up having a Disneyland trip and I would have taken the day off anyway but I guess my real answer would be that I cut a lot of class in college to play Final Fantasy 7 it was real good and I was really into it I was more into it than some of my classes I had at the time

1272
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:26,941
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1273
01:41:44,177 --> 01:41:57,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I skipped work while I took time off for, um, Grand Theft Auto, well, recently it was, well, actually it wasn't that recent, but Grand Theft Auto 4, uh, to try to get 100% on everything so I could get the keys to the city.

1274
01:41:58,021 --> 01:42:06,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I technically did within the time frame that they had in the whole contest thing, but they only had a limited amount of keys and it wasn't registering the information correctly.

1275
01:42:06,603 --> 01:42:11,605
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a huge delay, so I unfortunately didn't get the keys to the city, but, um...

1276
01:42:12,906 --> 01:42:30,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the achievement for 100% though I took time off work when Final Fantasy XI came out I remember that, I was so jazzed for that game I totally took the day off when that came out too That was years ago I didn't skip work, I just took the day off So I guess it's not as bad if you planned it in advance, right?

1277
01:42:30,783 --> 01:42:32,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably take the day off work for Grand Theft Auto V

1278
01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:35,410
[SPEAKER_04]: in the future.

1279
01:42:35,771 --> 01:42:36,231
[SPEAKER_03]: In the future.

1280
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:37,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Planning for 2013.

1281
01:42:37,854 --> 01:42:42,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we have some more news stories for you guys and then we'll get your Skype calls here in a little bit.

1282
01:42:43,075 --> 01:42:48,917
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so there's this new patent from Sony for a controller.

1283
01:42:49,057 --> 01:42:57,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, at least in the diagram, it shows a PlayStation Move controller, but apparently it's a controller that allows the user to feel temperature change.

1284
01:42:58,321 --> 01:43:12,126
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, the controller could get hotter, like if your gun overheats or you get hit by a fireball or you're in an area where there's fire or something like that, or colder, you know, if you're in an icy area or something.

1285
01:43:13,026 --> 01:43:18,528
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, it kind of like a temperature feedback as well as like, you know, how they have the force feedback and stuff.

1286
01:43:19,268 --> 01:43:20,989
[SPEAKER_04]: So, neat.

1287
01:43:21,209 --> 01:43:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's necessarily something that they're going to be, um, implementing into a move controller or something like that soon, but, um, you know, it's kind of cool to have this technology around for whenever you may use it in the future.

1288
01:43:34,794 --> 01:43:36,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for some new controller or something, but...

1289
01:43:37,735 --> 01:43:42,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it'd be a big deal, like, you know, a controller got cold and went into an icy area.

1290
01:43:42,156 --> 01:43:43,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be kind of, haha, that's neat.

1291
01:43:44,636 --> 01:43:46,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to leave it cold all the time, you know.

1292
01:43:47,277 --> 01:43:48,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes your hands get sweaty.

1293
01:43:48,937 --> 01:43:51,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should detect whether your hands are sweaty and then cool off.

1294
01:43:52,098 --> 01:43:53,998
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a third-party company idea right there.

1295
01:43:56,439 --> 01:44:01,800
[SPEAKER_03]: If PlayStation had indie games, somebody would release an indie game that's called Hand Warmer.

1296
01:44:05,307 --> 01:44:06,848
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the sequel, Hand Freezer.

1297
01:44:07,148 --> 01:44:08,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who needs this technology?

1298
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:11,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft for the Xbox 360.

1299
01:44:12,111 --> 01:44:12,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1300
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:17,434
[SPEAKER_04]: When it detects it's getting hot, it gets colder so that the system doesn't crash.

1301
01:44:18,335 --> 01:44:18,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1302
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I see what you did there.

1303
01:44:20,136 --> 01:44:20,636
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

1304
01:44:20,796 --> 01:44:22,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's just water cool everything.

1305
01:44:22,257 --> 01:44:22,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1306
01:44:23,021 --> 01:44:25,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it wouldn't be hard for the PlayStation controller to get hot.

1307
01:44:25,803 --> 01:44:32,087
[SPEAKER_03]: They could just put in there whatever they put in iPhones because the iPhones get really hot if you're using it too much.

1308
01:44:33,628 --> 01:44:37,210
[SPEAKER_03]: When it's really straining for a signal, I notice it gets really hot.

1309
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:38,992
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they could do it.

1310
01:44:41,954 --> 01:44:44,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could implement this into the iPhone.

1311
01:44:45,896 --> 01:44:50,119
[SPEAKER_04]: When you piss off Siri by asking a bunch of stupid questions, it'll just melt down into your hand.

1312
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:54,062
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to burn your hand now.

1313
01:44:54,423 --> 01:44:54,965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1314
01:44:55,366 --> 01:44:56,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Wrong answer.

1315
01:44:57,872 --> 01:44:58,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Punishing games.

1316
01:44:58,513 --> 01:45:01,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of dumb.

1317
01:45:02,808 --> 01:45:06,011
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be something that you'd add to haptics later on.

1318
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:08,073
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's get the haptics thing out of the way first.

1319
01:45:09,093 --> 01:45:13,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I think more people would be interested in touching things rather than... Oh, it's cold now.

1320
01:45:14,858 --> 01:45:19,042
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, actually, challenge number one, getting people to buy the move.

1321
01:45:19,422 --> 01:45:20,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That's challenge number one.

1322
01:45:20,843 --> 01:45:25,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Challenge two, implementing temperature change in there and having people be interested.

1323
01:45:26,067 --> 01:45:30,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And seriously, how is temperature change going to come in handy in Just Dance 4 or like...

1324
01:45:32,293 --> 01:45:37,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, archery and sports champions or... Maybe this is why the last Guardian got delayed.

1325
01:45:37,518 --> 01:45:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he's guarding temperature.

1326
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1327
01:45:43,043 --> 01:45:46,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's because it's going to be a launch title on another system or something.

1328
01:45:47,608 --> 01:45:49,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, or maybe it's nothing.

1329
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:55,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just somebody had the idea and it was like, you know what, let's patent it just in case Nintendo's thinking of something.

1330
01:45:57,372 --> 01:46:00,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is an interesting little rumor that's going around.

1331
01:46:01,414 --> 01:46:05,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it with a grain of salt because it's spawned from a NeoGAF post, but you never know.

1332
01:46:06,116 --> 01:46:07,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes where there's smoke, there's fire.

1333
01:46:07,536 --> 01:46:15,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, rumor is, Shigeru Miyamoto is expected to leave Nintendo's EAD division by December.

1334
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,841
[SPEAKER_04]: How many times has this rumor been around?

1335
01:46:17,881 --> 01:46:23,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, there was another rumor that he, this was like a couple months ago, that it was the same damn thing.

1336
01:46:48,417 --> 01:47:13,032
[SPEAKER_03]: A major shift in Kyoto development sources involving three research and development buildings New groups and new producers being announced for EAD Kyoto and SPD Kyoto A Tokyo expansion of EAD and Mashihiro Sakurai possibly joining EAD Tokyo New division led by Miyamoto with younger staff focused on smaller scale games

1337
01:47:14,338 --> 01:47:43,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Miyamoto's departure inspiring new IPs for the EAD Kyoto division and Cliffy B going to EAD Tokyo I added the last one myself I added that one myself I was just waiting for Cliffy B come on I had to throw my own wank on there too why not everybody else is maybe that's a list list Nintendo wank best Nintendo wank come on let's make up a Nintendo rumor come on come on Alan make up a Nintendo rumor

1338
01:47:45,527 --> 01:47:53,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii U will use points like XBLA and have DRM.

1339
01:47:55,757 --> 01:47:56,117
Yeah, see?

1340
01:47:56,157 --> 01:47:56,337
Yeah.

1341
01:48:06,403 --> 01:48:08,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... Nintendo Wank.

1342
01:48:08,707 --> 01:48:09,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1343
01:48:09,388 --> 01:48:09,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh... Ugh.

1344
01:48:19,485 --> 01:48:20,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, this is tough.

1345
01:48:20,786 --> 01:48:21,967
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough to come up with something stupid.

1346
01:48:22,127 --> 01:48:22,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine, fine.

1347
01:48:22,928 --> 01:48:25,570
[SPEAKER_03]: People pull this shit out of their ass all day long.

1348
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:32,116
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I have to be selective when I pull out of my ass to make it sound a little bit more legitimate than the other people that pull stuff out of their ass.

1349
01:48:32,736 --> 01:48:33,137
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing.

1350
01:48:33,157 --> 01:48:34,578
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I was giving it some thought there.

1351
01:48:34,678 --> 01:48:39,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, the man who works for the distributor, what is Nintendo going to do next?

1352
01:48:39,863 --> 01:48:40,543
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you posting?

1353
01:48:40,563 --> 01:48:44,887
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to fake another shortage on the goddamn Wii U system to create an artificial demand.

1354
01:48:46,288 --> 01:48:47,109
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a rumor.

1355
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:52,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, did you hear what... No, this actually didn't make our show, but did you hear what their fucking excuse was?

1356
01:48:52,623 --> 01:48:57,508
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a fire in a production plant, and I guess that lowered their amount of units that they're going to put out by like a million or something.

1357
01:48:57,528 --> 01:49:00,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that the same excuse they used for the gasoline prices going up?

1358
01:49:00,972 --> 01:49:02,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a fire in a production plant.

1359
01:49:02,874 --> 01:49:04,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddamn, we used... We're there.

1360
01:49:04,175 --> 01:49:05,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we store them next to the oil?

1361
01:49:05,817 --> 01:49:07,278
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know...

1362
01:49:07,638 --> 01:49:15,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananigram and Chat wants to remind me they did get rid of the points because the Nintendo 3DS eShop does use regular money for currency.

1363
01:49:15,222 --> 01:49:16,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they got rid of those cards.

1364
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:17,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1365
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:18,464
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they're going to do?

1366
01:49:18,484 --> 01:49:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Nintendo rumor.

1367
01:49:19,545 --> 01:49:19,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1368
01:49:20,325 --> 01:49:20,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

1369
01:49:21,426 --> 01:49:23,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Their online integration is going to be really mediocre.

1370
01:49:25,268 --> 01:49:26,309
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't rumors!

1371
01:49:27,709 --> 01:49:28,530
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS Micro.

1372
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:31,472
[SPEAKER_04]: It's small enough to fit in your pocket now.

1373
01:49:32,842 --> 01:49:43,668
[SPEAKER_04]: And to take inspiration from Apple, they're going to make their next 3DS super wide so they can have yet another attachment for the stupid... Have you seen the LL and XL?

1374
01:49:43,788 --> 01:49:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen the... I was like, okay, we made it bigger.

1375
01:49:47,069 --> 01:49:48,070
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have put a thumb pad here.

1376
01:49:48,090 --> 01:49:53,192
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we're going to have an even larger thing that's going to attach to it and make it even wider than it was.

1377
01:49:53,292 --> 01:49:54,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that really happening?

1378
01:49:54,733 --> 01:49:55,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's really happening.

1379
01:49:55,814 --> 01:49:56,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1380
01:49:56,294 --> 01:49:56,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it out yet?

1381
01:49:57,255 --> 01:49:59,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's coming out in Japan if it's not out already.

1382
01:49:59,816 --> 01:50:00,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1383
01:50:00,657 --> 01:50:01,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very soon.

1384
01:50:01,137 --> 01:50:01,938
[SPEAKER_04]: They have pictures of it.

1385
01:50:02,538 --> 01:50:03,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not Photoshop.

1386
01:50:03,459 --> 01:50:07,541
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like this is an official thing because, you know, you want the larger thing.

1387
01:50:07,781 --> 01:50:14,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, it's just – let me just add another, like, half of a laptop right here, and I'll put just a giant, like, analog.

1388
01:50:14,646 --> 01:50:15,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I should do that.

1389
01:50:15,206 --> 01:50:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, make a project.

1390
01:50:16,187 --> 01:50:18,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You have this analog stick that's just, like, the size of my hand.

1391
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:18,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1392
01:50:20,209 --> 01:50:25,734
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll look like that Tetris game at Golf Land with the gigantic joystick that you use to move the pieces.

1393
01:50:25,754 --> 01:50:26,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that?

1394
01:50:26,335 --> 01:50:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sega Tetris?

1395
01:50:27,175 --> 01:50:28,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised no one's actually sold one of those.

1396
01:50:28,877 --> 01:50:30,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a home thing.

1397
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:33,421
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be fun.

1398
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be fun.

1399
01:50:35,022 --> 01:50:35,383
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1400
01:50:36,984 --> 01:50:37,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

1401
01:50:37,725 --> 01:50:39,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, do you have some legitimate news for us?

1402
01:50:40,553 --> 01:50:43,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Kickstarter, everyone's favorite controversial crowdsource.

1403
01:50:43,396 --> 01:50:45,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I said legitimate.

1404
01:50:45,898 --> 01:50:49,682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going live in the UK on Halloween.

1405
01:50:50,122 --> 01:50:51,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a part of the same site.

1406
01:50:51,504 --> 01:50:55,447
[SPEAKER_05]: There is not going to be some Kickstarter-UK.com.

1407
01:50:55,487 --> 01:50:56,488
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just Kickstarter.

1408
01:50:56,929 --> 01:51:01,413
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're within the UK, you can now put up your project online.

1409
01:51:01,713 --> 01:51:31,157
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously the currency available is going to be listed in pounds doesn't say anything about euros here yeah you can set your goal and your stretch goals and I imagine if you're in the US and you want you see something awesome over in the UK you can bid on it like you can any other Kickstarter but yeah they got the payment and the those sketchy you know legal financial stuff sorted out so yay UK you're getting Kickstarter sure they're all very excited that's all I got there you go

1410
01:51:34,262 --> 01:51:38,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they got their legal stuff worked out, but there was already, you know, the other... So, whatever.

1411
01:51:41,354 --> 01:51:46,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun getting addicted to Kickstarter or hating on it or whatever side of the fence you choose to be on.

1412
01:51:47,518 --> 01:51:50,060
[SPEAKER_03]: As diverse as we are on this show, have fun with that, UK.

1413
01:51:51,581 --> 01:51:52,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So Borderlands sold a lot of copies.

1414
01:51:53,723 --> 01:51:54,743
[SPEAKER_04]: How many copies?

1415
01:51:55,164 --> 01:51:55,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

1416
01:51:55,584 --> 01:51:56,264
[SPEAKER_04]: 1.4 million copies.

1417
01:51:56,365 --> 01:51:57,165
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of copies.

1418
01:51:57,205 --> 01:51:57,886
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a success.

1419
01:51:59,046 --> 01:51:59,727
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 bucks a pop.

1420
01:51:59,747 --> 01:52:00,828
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of money.

1421
01:52:01,008 --> 01:52:01,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1422
01:52:01,768 --> 01:52:07,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, also that I believe it sold, I can't remember what percent, 234% more than the first game.

1423
01:52:10,134 --> 01:52:11,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So at launch, that's pretty awesome.

1424
01:52:12,798 --> 01:52:16,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so awesome, NBA Baller Beats, which sold 3000 copies.

1425
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:20,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

1426
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:24,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean there wasn't a market for basketball and music fusion games?

1427
01:52:25,162 --> 01:52:26,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Basketball, yeah, exactly.

1428
01:52:26,703 --> 01:52:35,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Basketball, you know, it's a Kinect game that requires you to have a floor that you're not in an apartment and that the floor is like hardwood or something.

1429
01:52:36,108 --> 01:52:37,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the ironic twist.

1430
01:52:38,069 --> 01:52:40,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's a collector's item when it sells that few copies.

1431
01:52:41,851 --> 01:52:42,431
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

1432
01:52:44,468 --> 01:52:46,870
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like saying that the Eye of Judgment is a collector's item.

1433
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:47,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

1434
01:52:47,690 --> 01:52:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of is in a way.

1435
01:52:48,991 --> 01:52:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: The Borderlands, that is only hard copies of the game.

1436
01:52:53,695 --> 01:52:57,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is saying digital distribution is not in that figure at all.

1437
01:52:57,257 --> 01:52:58,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's even more awesome for them.

1438
01:52:58,498 --> 01:52:59,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's awesome.

1439
01:52:59,659 --> 01:53:02,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, the digital version of NBA Baller Beats doesn't exist.

1440
01:53:02,921 --> 01:53:05,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't use that to inflate the numbers there.

1441
01:53:05,871 --> 01:53:12,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wants to remind us NBA Baller Beats had 50,000 Twitter followers.

1442
01:53:12,373 --> 01:53:13,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that whole thing?

1443
01:53:13,653 --> 01:53:17,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did they only sell 3,000 copies of the game with 50,000 Twitter followers?

1444
01:53:17,834 --> 01:53:21,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mean to tell me they had fake Twitter followers?

1445
01:53:21,815 --> 01:53:22,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't 50,000.

1446
01:53:22,795 --> 01:53:25,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 500,000 Twitter followers.

1447
01:53:25,836 --> 01:53:31,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's 500,000 because I think they have 100,000 for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 or something like that.

1448
01:53:31,937 --> 01:53:33,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they bought their Twitter followers.

1449
01:53:34,733 --> 01:53:35,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1450
01:53:37,916 --> 01:53:42,560
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean to tell me that they bought all those Twitter followers?

1451
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:44,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they did.

1452
01:53:44,121 --> 01:53:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an article in the Penny Arcade.

1453
01:53:45,682 --> 01:53:47,464
[SPEAKER_03]: 449,631 followers and they sold 3,000 copies of the game?

1454
01:53:47,544 --> 01:53:49,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because all those guys are really legit.

1455
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:00,724
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's great is even after all that they're like, we didn't buy those followers.

1456
01:54:01,464 --> 01:54:03,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people are really excited about this game.

1457
01:54:03,846 --> 01:54:04,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, really?

1458
01:54:06,067 --> 01:54:08,589
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what game sold better than NBA Baller Beats?

1459
01:54:09,309 --> 01:54:10,010
[SPEAKER_03]: President Cat.

1460
01:54:12,472 --> 01:54:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: The Eye of Judgment The Eye of Judgment Sold better than NBA Baller Beats Oh, I feel like this is a game on like the $25,000 pyramid or something Or Family Feud or something Name a game that sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats Ready?

1461
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:33,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Barbie Horse Adventures 2

1462
01:54:37,219 --> 01:54:39,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not yet, but we will hit that mark.

1463
01:54:39,361 --> 01:54:43,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Bungie Ferret Tossing will sell better than NBA Baller Beats.

1464
01:54:45,286 --> 01:54:47,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Tokyo Jungle will sell more than NBA Baller Beats.

1465
01:54:47,347 --> 01:54:50,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure it already has.

1466
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:51,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1467
01:54:51,911 --> 01:54:56,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Secrets of the Mystical Unicorn, the game with the pink anus on Steam, has probably sold more than 3,000 copies.

1468
01:54:57,867 --> 01:55:01,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think what was the worst game I can think of that's a paid game.

1469
01:55:02,652 --> 01:55:03,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst game ever.

1470
01:55:06,296 --> 01:55:08,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Trap sold more than NBA Baller Beats.

1471
01:55:09,399 --> 01:55:13,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say Bullet Witch sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

1472
01:55:14,064 --> 01:55:19,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Master Chu and the Drunk Nard Who on the NES probably sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

1473
01:55:20,305 --> 01:55:25,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, even like Steel Battalion, that last one that came out, sold more than that.

1474
01:55:25,549 --> 01:55:26,110
[SPEAKER_03]: The $400 Xbox game?

1475
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was fucking broken.

1476
01:55:28,471 --> 01:55:32,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Beatmania sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, burn!

1478

[SPEAKER_03]: Poppin' Music on Xbox Live Arcade, or what was it called?

1479
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:42,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat and Groovy sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

1480
01:55:43,959 --> 01:55:44,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Guccigucci

01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:51,091
This is really bad.

1484
01:56:51,111 --> 01:56:51,871
This is too long.

1485
01:56:51,911 --> 01:56:52,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the chorus?

1486
01:56:52,792 --> 01:56:54,233
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make it to the chorus.

1487
01:56:54,253 --> 01:56:57,096
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably picked the worst part of the song to... Whatever.

1488
01:57:19,714 --> 01:57:21,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go, the worst part of the worst song.

01:57:22,136 --> 01:57:23,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst part of the worst song.

1490
01:57:23,356 --> 01:57:32,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and DarkSakura says that song was probably in NBA Baller Beats.

[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, ouch.

[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you win.

1502
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,360
[SPEAKER_03]: You win in internet.

1503
01:57:59,321 --> 01:58:00,161
[SPEAKER_03]: This story's over.

1504
01:58:03,183 --> 01:58:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Marissa.

1505
01:58:04,383 --> 01:58:05,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Marissa.

1506
01:58:05,484 --> 01:58:05,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.

1507
01:58:06,024 --> 01:58:06,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's in our chat room.

1508
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:10,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And she just said, this bitch just rapped about Adderall.

1509
01:58:15,182 --> 01:58:16,623
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, does this still work?

1510
01:58:17,024 --> 01:58:18,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point this out.

1511
01:58:18,145 --> 01:58:21,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Marissa to know this because this is how bad Marissa needs to come back to the show.

1512
01:58:21,668 --> 01:58:25,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you know how Google has the predictive search feature, right?

1513
01:58:25,251 --> 01:58:26,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I want to show you something.

1514
01:58:26,653 --> 01:58:30,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Google and type Orange Lounge

1515
01:58:31,397 --> 01:58:31,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Radio.

1516
01:58:33,138 --> 01:58:35,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh, yeah, of course, the one time I do it here.

1517
01:58:35,860 --> 01:58:36,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know why?

1518
01:58:36,421 --> 01:58:38,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not doing global research.

1519
01:58:39,363 --> 01:58:40,904
[SPEAKER_03]: But I swear to God, I did this the other day.

1520
01:58:41,024 --> 01:58:42,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I typed in Orange Lounge Radio.

1521
01:58:43,405 --> 01:58:47,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the predictive search, the number two thing that came up said Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa.

1522
01:58:49,330 --> 01:59:03,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Orange Lounge Radio, Chatroom, Orange Lounge Radio, Loki It was Orange Lounge Radio, Marissa Swear to God I was looking at this yesterday and I was laughing my ass off In a good way because I love Marissa But it's just funny that how long ago was it she was on this show?

1523
01:59:07,364 --> 01:59:10,947
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow, let's move on.

1524
01:59:12,168 --> 01:59:19,314
[SPEAKER_03]: An appropriate story to follow that last story is about a game design jam called Fuck This Jam.

1525
01:59:20,414 --> 01:59:23,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is putting this on?

1526
01:59:23,597 --> 01:59:24,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on a website.

1527
01:59:24,678 --> 01:59:26,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called fuckthisjam.com.

1528
01:59:26,339 --> 01:59:27,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's appropriate.

1529
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:28,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, here it is.

1530
01:59:28,861 --> 01:59:35,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organized by Rami Ismail of Vlambeer and independent designer Fernando Romalo.

1531
01:59:35,867 --> 01:59:39,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck This Jam apparently was basically an inside joke.

1532
01:59:39,930 --> 01:59:44,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out of a conversation that they had when they went to an arcade in Austin, Texas.

1533
01:59:44,613 --> 01:59:47,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It will take place from November 9th through the 17th.

1534
01:59:47,776 --> 01:59:51,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why would you care about this besides the cute name?

1535
01:59:51,879 --> 01:59:52,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because...

1536
01:59:53,160 --> 02:00:04,242
[SPEAKER_03]: The participants in this little contest or whatever, they will be tasked with creating a game in a genre or style that you would ordinarily have disdain for.

1537
02:00:04,843 --> 02:00:08,543
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, let's say you're the type of person that's like, you know what, I hate sports games.

1538
02:00:08,743 --> 02:00:10,064
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't want to play sports.

1539
02:00:10,084 --> 02:00:11,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I never play sports games.

1540
02:00:11,684 --> 02:00:14,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Then your job in the jam would be to design a sports game.

1541
02:00:15,005 --> 02:00:17,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Or let's say, you know, I hate first-person shooters.

1542
02:00:17,085 --> 02:00:18,665
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to design a first-person shooter.

1543
02:00:18,745 --> 02:00:19,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate retro games.

1544
02:00:20,226 --> 02:00:20,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate role-playing games.

1545
02:00:21,346 --> 02:00:42,536
[SPEAKER_03]: so I actually think this is a really neat idea to encourage people to get out of their comfort zones because this is where some of the best ideas come from and you know it's going to lend itself to crossover potential I bet something out of this ends up on Project Greenlight or something just you wait just you wait good luck to everybody that's participating in that fuck this jam

1546
02:00:44,161 --> 02:00:45,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's go to the mailbag.

1547
02:00:45,623 --> 02:00:53,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick our favorites out of the mailbag and read them live on air.

1548
02:00:54,634 --> 02:00:59,840
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is not here to read them tonight, but Alan, being such a good sport, has volunteered to read the emails.

1549
02:01:00,161 --> 02:01:01,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It probably helped that there was only one.

1550
02:01:02,383 --> 02:01:02,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1551
02:01:04,316 --> 02:01:09,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's one email, and I really empathize with the person who wrote it.

1552
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:16,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind enough to write it in, because when I write stuff, I'm often very verbose and go on about something I care a lot about.

1553
02:01:16,126 --> 02:01:23,632
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Windows 8 rant email, and this person did say how long it is, and it is long enough that we're not going to read the whole thing on the show.

1554
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not personal.

1555
02:01:26,594 --> 02:01:27,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is from...

1556
02:01:31,322 --> 02:01:31,803
[SPEAKER_05]: 13x Forever.

1557
02:01:32,603 --> 02:01:36,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And he writes a Windows 8 email and he says, Hello, OLR crew and Bobby.

1558
02:01:36,565 --> 02:01:41,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard you have an empty mailbox problem, so I finally took my time to write about that Windows 8 hate show two weeks ago.

1559
02:01:42,008 --> 02:01:51,874
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I love that our show is now a relay to Bobby, as well as just like blast us with an email and hope Bobby gets some splash damage from it all.

1560
02:01:52,934 --> 02:01:53,956
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an AoE attack.

1561
02:01:54,156 --> 02:01:54,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1562
02:01:54,897 --> 02:01:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, all our crew and Bobby.

1563
02:01:56,278 --> 02:02:01,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard you have an empty mailbox problem, so I finally took my time to write about that Windows 8 hate show two weeks ago.

1564
02:02:02,285 --> 02:02:05,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this mail will be long, so maybe you should skip it for the show.

1565
02:02:05,549 --> 02:02:05,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1566
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:10,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I have to apologize in advance if I trail off topic or go on Rumble for too long.

1567
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:31,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah, first of all, I highly recommend to read Paul Allen's take on Windows 8 with a link, interface changes, and Rafael Rivera's post on the Minecraft certification debacle, and optionally, his own rant, or the person who wrote this in, on Google+, on this topic.

1568
02:02:31,843 --> 02:02:39,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it goes on, and unfortunately we can't read all of it, but he did include, thank you, Ryder, a TLDR summary.

1569
02:02:41,006 --> 02:02:43,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart idea when you send in a long email.

1570
02:02:43,688 --> 02:02:45,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Include the too-long-didn't-read portion.

1571
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:50,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So TLDR summary, you should really try it for yourself before judging.

1572
02:02:50,453 --> 02:02:54,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes to build something new, you have to break something old, and people will hate you for it.

1573
02:02:54,855 --> 02:03:00,499
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the hate on the internet for Windows 8 stems from a few articles published by ignorant writers to get more clicks for their websites.

1574
02:03:01,079 --> 02:03:07,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Desktop experience is the same as for Windows 7, only much more polished, plus you have Metro, which is mostly optional.

1575
02:03:08,164 --> 02:03:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Notch is fighting some illusory threats of software freedom on commercial OS 2 in most unconventional ways.

1576
02:03:15,729 --> 02:03:20,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Windows 8 will sell worse than Windows 7 and everyone will point and laugh.

1577
02:03:20,153 --> 02:03:23,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably biased Russian neighbor 13x forever.

1578
02:03:23,975 --> 02:03:30,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm wondering maybe if I'm on the VOG article for when the podcast episode goes up, maybe we can include that email.

1579
02:03:31,140 --> 02:03:32,360
[SPEAKER_05]: on the forums, on the forums.

1580
02:03:54,406 --> 02:03:59,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because they've seen some screenshots and they don't like the fact that there's something different.

1581
02:03:59,609 --> 02:04:02,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That they're presenting this start menu and it's different.

1582
02:04:02,952 --> 02:04:05,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm paraphrasing here and this is the message I took from it.

1583
02:04:05,933 --> 02:04:08,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It was essentially, change is going to happen.

1584
02:04:09,035 --> 02:04:10,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Change is inevitable.

1585
02:04:10,456 --> 02:04:12,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Change has to start from somewhere.

1586
02:04:12,397 --> 02:04:16,580
[SPEAKER_03]: If you like the start menu, didn't the start menu start somewhere?

1587
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:20,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is everybody hating on this when many of them haven't tried it?

1588
02:04:21,263 --> 02:04:23,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate this, I hate this cause it looks like an Xbox

1589
02:04:42,353 --> 02:04:50,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Not Gabe Newell basically said we've messed around with the Windows 8 kit and he was like personally he didn't want to design software for it because he thought it was a big steaming turd.

1590
02:04:51,004 --> 02:04:54,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever someone from Valve says something, everyone like...

1591
02:04:55,540 --> 02:05:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Valve says Windows 8 is garbage and then it just echoes through the whole internet which is not really what they said right yeah that the whole game of telephone happens yeah so interesting now I will say there was also a portion of the email that really addressed the whole Windows certification thing and the fact that I think people are reading too much into it and it's not that Microsoft that was a huge part of what yeah the Valve complaint was too so

1592
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:22,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear, it's not that Microsoft wants a cut of it.

1593
02:05:22,782 --> 02:05:24,903
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that Microsoft wants to certify it.

1594
02:05:25,003 --> 02:05:29,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming it's similar to how they might certify.

1595
02:05:29,445 --> 02:05:32,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I know because I've done some of this development at work.

1596
02:05:32,647 --> 02:05:42,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's harder to run macros and even access in Word if you don't certify your content because of the illegitimate stuff that's out there.

1597
02:05:42,212 --> 02:05:45,533
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine expanding that bubble to include software.

1598
02:05:45,573 --> 02:05:46,814
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where it's going.

1599
02:05:46,854 --> 02:05:52,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that kind of like the Nintendo's official CLO quality where they had to play every game even if it was bad to make sure it was good enough?

1600
02:05:52,897 --> 02:05:58,039
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't do that anymore because, of course, the Wii is the biggest shovelware console in like 10 years.

1601
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:01,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and also people got around the Nintendo CLO quality.

1602
02:06:01,981 --> 02:06:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it worked for a while, but then when it was because Atari or Tengen, as it was, won that lawsuit where they tried to stop that from happening...

1603
02:06:11,966 --> 02:06:18,910
[SPEAKER_03]: They were able to keep Tetris off the shelves because that was a particular circumstance, but they were not able to keep those cartridges off shelves.

1604
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:26,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember if the lawsuit was Tengen specifically or if it was one of the other companies like Color Dreams or one of them back in the day, but Nintendo tried to stop it.

1605
02:06:26,895 --> 02:06:28,736
[SPEAKER_03]: They lost, so there was nothing they could do about it.

1606
02:06:28,776 --> 02:06:31,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think at that point, they kind of gave up.

1607
02:06:31,537 --> 02:06:36,720
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Nintendo put those locks into place because they were trying to prevent another video game crash.

1608
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:39,302
[SPEAKER_03]: The other big, big, big thing they did on the NES, remember this?

1609
02:06:39,542 --> 02:06:43,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because a lot of the games on the 2600 weren't even designed on proper development kits.

1610
02:06:43,626 --> 02:06:44,207
[SPEAKER_05]: They were trash.

1611
02:06:44,267 --> 02:06:44,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1612
02:06:44,787 --> 02:06:47,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, publishers could only put out three games a year.

1613
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:50,773
[SPEAKER_03]: If you paid for these development kits or whatever, you could only put out three games a year.

1614
02:06:51,254 --> 02:06:56,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why, well, you had these publishers start to put out, just invent subsidiaries to get around it.

1615
02:06:56,619 --> 02:06:58,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where Ultra Games came from.

1616
02:06:58,221 --> 02:06:59,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultra Games was just Konami.

1617
02:06:59,922 --> 02:07:00,503
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it was.

1618
02:07:00,983 --> 02:07:11,433
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just Konami and it existed solely to put out more Konami games on the NES like Metal Gear and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were Ultra Games.

1619
02:07:12,994 --> 02:07:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was Konami.

1620
02:07:14,555 --> 02:07:14,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway...

1621
02:07:16,618 --> 02:07:20,883
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a total tangent that that emailer was not expecting at all whatsoever, but there you go.

1622
02:07:21,243 --> 02:07:23,866
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the day, let's go back, take a step back.

1623
02:07:24,527 --> 02:07:27,810
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the course part of the argument?

1624
02:07:28,070 --> 02:07:32,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what I took away from it was don't knock it until you've tried it.

1625
02:07:34,088 --> 02:07:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Allen, is it fair?

1626
02:07:35,129 --> 02:07:35,529
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.

1627
02:07:35,609 --> 02:07:37,550
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't tried it, so should you be knocking it?

1628
02:07:38,771 --> 02:07:47,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Windows, well, I made a joke once that Windows OSs are like the Star Trek movies, the original ones, that every other one is a piece of shit and the other, every other one is really good.

1629
02:07:48,017 --> 02:07:52,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Because XP Professional, I ran for years because it was rock solid.

1630
02:07:53,120 --> 02:08:01,386
[SPEAKER_05]: When Vista came out, they tried to drag gamers over to Vista by saying if you want DirectX 10, you have to use Vista.

1631
02:08:02,286 --> 02:08:05,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, DirectX fine is 9 for me, I'll stay on XP.

1632
02:08:06,067 --> 02:08:09,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And now 7 is so fucking good, I can't imagine why I'd want to leave 7.

1633
02:08:10,048 --> 02:08:10,448
[SPEAKER_05]: 7's great.

1634
02:08:12,589 --> 02:08:16,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bummer is, it's not like you can just try 8 out and then go back or 10.

1635
02:08:16,950 --> 02:08:19,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you can.

1636
02:08:20,051 --> 02:08:21,871
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think you can down rev windows.

1637
02:08:22,451 --> 02:08:25,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's either all in or out.

1638
02:08:25,972 --> 02:08:28,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well thank you very much for the email, even if it was a little long.

1639
02:08:29,875 --> 02:08:32,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we covered the points to your satisfaction.

1640
02:08:32,396 --> 02:08:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, you know, either way, we still appreciate the other perspective.

1641
02:08:36,297 --> 02:08:38,458
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1642
02:08:38,718 --> 02:08:40,119
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to disagree sometimes.

1643
02:08:41,059 --> 02:08:42,920
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's get into the FUs of the week.

1644
02:08:59,919 --> 02:09:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, why don't you start us off tonight with your FU?

1645
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:09,783
[SPEAKER_04]: An FU to eMachineshop for their fur I'm not working nicely with Google SketchUp, unfortunately.

1646
02:09:10,263 --> 02:09:20,488
[SPEAKER_04]: The wonderful painstaking process of creating the part of the beatgear pad or whatever, it came out nice, so they can't import it at all.

1647
02:09:21,168 --> 02:09:26,110
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried recreating it in their stupid pad editor, and it sucks.

1648
02:09:27,530 --> 02:09:28,311
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck that.

1649
02:09:30,662 --> 02:09:41,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, despite all the stress I went through in the past week, I had a pretty good weekend, so I can't complain too much, although I will say F you to my voice, and F you to the fact that I'm getting old.

1650
02:09:42,044 --> 02:09:48,706
[SPEAKER_03]: That part kind of sucks, and yeah, I didn't just do Rocky on Friday.

1651
02:09:49,266 --> 02:09:54,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually helped out with another performance piece that some of the gals on cast asked me to do.

1652
02:09:55,247 --> 02:09:59,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Just play a really quick walk-on roll-in, and I did it, so I had to do that last night.

1653
02:09:59,508 --> 02:10:00,828
[SPEAKER_03]: That is part of that performance.

1654
02:10:00,888 --> 02:10:03,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm supposed to die on stage, which means I have to take a stage fall.

1655
02:10:04,469 --> 02:10:07,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally bruised my knee doing that yesterday.

1656
02:10:07,749 --> 02:10:08,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So that part sucked.

1657
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:15,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So FU to getting old, where my bones are old and frail and I can't take falls like I used to be able to.

1658
02:10:16,011 --> 02:10:16,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah.

1659
02:10:17,251 --> 02:10:18,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, your FU's of the week.

1660
02:10:19,411 --> 02:10:20,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are going pretty well for me.

1661
02:10:20,832 --> 02:10:23,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a second day off this week, which I wasn't expecting.

1662
02:10:24,092 --> 02:10:25,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So the apartment's all clean.

1663
02:10:27,533 --> 02:10:28,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate...

1664
02:10:29,761 --> 02:10:30,801
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, the FUs of the week.

1665
02:10:30,821 --> 02:10:33,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Two more stories and then Twitter topics and the Skype line.

1666
02:10:33,062 --> 02:10:33,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki.

1667
02:10:50,382 --> 02:10:57,766
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so there's going to be some price discounts pretty soon for the Xbox 360 coming in the form of their holiday bundles.

1668
02:10:57,806 --> 02:11:00,948
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually going to have two bundles out that are actually pretty cool.

1669
02:11:01,508 --> 02:11:06,631
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one that's going to be the Kinect 4GB bundle, and they have a 250GB just regular bundle.

1670
02:11:13,155 --> 02:11:39,864
[SPEAKER_04]: for $250 you can get a holiday bundle which is the 250GB Kinect and those are usually $350 and I guess the bundles have different games packed in they've got DLC codes for everything from Forza 4 Kinect Disneyland Adventures Fable 3 Halo Reach and also they're going to have I guess codes for a digital copy of Skyrim I actually saw that in one of them um

1671
02:11:41,204 --> 02:11:41,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1672
02:11:42,205 --> 02:11:53,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I can get a 4GB console for $250 or just a regular system without a Kinect bundle in there for $250.

1673
02:11:53,935 --> 02:11:57,898
[SPEAKER_04]: That comes with Forza and Skyrim as a digital copy.

1674
02:11:58,018 --> 02:12:08,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they have a 4GB Kinect bundle that's going to have Kinect Adventures and Kinect Disneyland Adventures.

1675
02:12:09,735 --> 02:12:10,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's kind of stupid.

1676
02:12:10,597 --> 02:12:12,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would you buy the old one?

1677
02:12:15,552 --> 02:12:41,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know for whatever reason I guess I'm marking down the old bundles in case you know because it doesn't seem very smart to have the old bundle with less stuff in it for the same for you know more than what it is with more stuff in it but apparently they still have the same pricing you can get the holiday bundle without connect Disneyland adventures I guess if you really hate Disney and you just you know fuck it I'm not getting anything extra you do that

1678
02:12:41,946 --> 02:12:58,103
[SPEAKER_04]: so those are three bundles that are available I guess now so you can check that out and then some older holiday bundles too they've got one with Halo, Reach, and Fable 3 that was the old one but I guess that's not available anymore cool

1679
02:12:59,389 --> 02:13:01,831
[SPEAKER_03]: No surprise there, price drops in time for the holidays.

1680
02:13:02,171 --> 02:13:05,274
[SPEAKER_03]: And for Wii U. Maybe that it's, yeah, true, competition there.

1681
02:13:05,314 --> 02:13:08,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe to, you know, just encourage a few more copies to move after Thanksgiving.

1682
02:13:08,937 --> 02:13:17,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly though, I mean, if you don't give a shit about Kinect, which honestly nowadays you probably shouldn't give a shit about Kinect, at least this console generation.

1683
02:13:18,605 --> 02:13:21,227
[SPEAKER_04]: The one with Forza 4 and Skyrim is a pretty good deal.

1684
02:13:21,848 --> 02:13:22,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are pretty awesome games.

1685
02:13:24,758 --> 02:13:25,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Good tip?

1686
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1687
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:29,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, one more story for you guys, and this is about what could have been.

1688
02:13:30,683 --> 02:13:34,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard had once planned a version of Diablo for the Game Boy Color.

1689
02:13:34,946 --> 02:13:36,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you even imagine that?

1690
02:13:37,568 --> 02:13:37,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Ew!

1691
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:38,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1692
02:13:39,570 --> 02:13:42,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Like StarCraft on the N64, you remember that?

1693
02:13:42,612 --> 02:13:42,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo Jr.

1694
02:14:05,151 --> 02:14:13,472
[SPEAKER_03]: each packing a different hero in the warrior rogue sorcerer vein as well as items that players would have to trade for in order to collect

1695
02:14:15,819 --> 02:14:18,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Development was only with a handful of staff.

1696
02:14:18,561 --> 02:14:22,044
[SPEAKER_03]: They started working on Diablo Junior after the release of Diablo 2.

1697
02:14:22,984 --> 02:14:29,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been the Game Boy Color or the Game Boy Advance or both, I guess just due to the timing of all of this.

1698
02:14:30,930 --> 02:14:37,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Diablo Junior was ultimately put out to pasture because of the steep production costs associated with developing handheld games.

1699
02:14:39,057 --> 02:14:43,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there is a book coming out or a project called Stay Awhile and Listen.

1700
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:49,905
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an unauthorized history of Blizzard based on the testimony of 80 ex-employees.

1701
02:14:50,706 --> 02:14:51,767
[SPEAKER_03]: This gonna be good.

1702
02:14:53,382 --> 02:14:55,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I didn't know somebody was working on something like that.

1703
02:14:55,723 --> 02:14:57,284
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like it's going to be amazing.

1704
02:14:58,064 --> 02:15:02,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, there was also another Diablo 2 expansion that never saw the light of day.

1705
02:15:03,046 --> 02:15:10,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going to have guild halls for multiplayer clan meetings and two other character classes that also came out of that.

1706
02:15:10,970 --> 02:15:11,290
[SPEAKER_05]: StarCraftGhost

1707
02:15:33,486 --> 02:15:33,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1708
02:15:34,868 --> 02:15:37,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this, the unauthorized look.

1709
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:40,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they're really awesome franchises from the 90s they haven't touched.

1710
02:15:41,593 --> 02:15:45,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Lost Vikings, or Blackthorn, or Rock and Roll Racing.

1711
02:15:47,258 --> 02:15:49,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they also do the Shake, Rattle, and Roll?

1712
02:15:49,360 --> 02:15:50,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that Blizzard?

1713
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:50,701
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1714
02:15:51,782 --> 02:15:52,743
[SPEAKER_05]: They got more franchises.

1715
02:15:52,763 --> 02:15:54,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Shake, Rattle, and Roll.

1716
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Who did that?

1717
02:15:57,226 --> 02:16:00,529
[SPEAKER_05]: There is more out there than WoW and Diablo.

1718
02:16:01,210 --> 02:16:01,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Blizzard.

1719
02:16:03,340 --> 02:16:04,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they could come up with something new.

1720
02:16:04,821 --> 02:16:07,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's a hard to believe concept.

1721
02:16:07,764 --> 02:16:08,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever Titan is.

1722
02:16:09,365 --> 02:16:11,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever Titan is supposed to be a completely unique IP.

1723
02:16:11,487 --> 02:16:12,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm an idiot.

1724
02:16:12,208 --> 02:16:14,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Snake Rattle and Roll was just straight up rare.

1725
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:17,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I think that was Blizzard?

1726
02:16:17,953 --> 02:16:20,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I really that dumb?

1727
02:16:20,595 --> 02:16:21,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

1728
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:25,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, shut up.

1729
02:16:25,642 --> 02:16:33,804
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1730
02:16:33,864 --> 02:16:36,565
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skype line is open right now.

1731
02:16:38,026 --> 02:16:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we're waiting for some calls to come in, we will do some tweets.

1732
02:16:42,347 --> 02:16:44,368
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw sending a few tweets tonight.

1733
02:16:44,708 --> 02:16:50,091
[SPEAKER_03]: See in here I thought it was a slow news week and yet we've got more stories coming in thanks to Twitter so I appreciate that.

1734
02:16:50,511 --> 02:16:55,794
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw on Twitter with a story EA apparently accidentally gave away thousands of free games.

1735
02:16:56,215 --> 02:16:56,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1736
02:16:57,075 --> 02:16:58,436
[SPEAKER_03]: How the hell did this happen?

1737
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:04,965
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a code that was, I think it was for reviewers or something like that, for Origin, where it gave people $20 off.

1738
02:17:05,065 --> 02:17:13,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it said it was a thanks for completing a survey, and it allowed them to download a free game from Origin, but the code could be used by anybody.

1739
02:17:13,872 --> 02:17:15,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an unlimited use code.

1740
02:17:16,534 --> 02:17:17,175
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.

1741
02:17:17,195 --> 02:17:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading it here on the story.

1742
02:17:18,356 --> 02:17:19,757
[SPEAKER_03]: The code was not secured.

1743
02:17:19,857 --> 02:17:21,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone made EA lose money.

1744
02:17:21,058 --> 02:17:23,420
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have to commit seppuku in a conference room.

1745
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:24,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my gosh.

1746
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:24,541
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1747
02:17:25,381 --> 02:17:27,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it ended up on Reddit.

1748
02:17:27,043 --> 02:17:27,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1749
02:17:29,184 --> 02:17:29,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect Mass Effect

1750
02:17:46,980 --> 02:18:02,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyway, before the new multiplayer stuff came out and the Omega DLC stuff got announced, Mike, I think it's Gamble, posted something about how the upcoming DLC is kind of like the shape of things to come.

1751
02:18:03,485 --> 02:18:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm wondering if this DLC is kind of...

1752
02:18:08,544 --> 02:18:15,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, pointing at a more massive multiplayer Mass Effect game.

1753
02:18:15,886 --> 02:18:17,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here we go.

1754
02:18:18,107 --> 02:18:20,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go, Mass Effect MMO.

1755
02:18:20,408 --> 02:18:23,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, I'm justifying it, okay?

1756
02:18:23,109 --> 02:18:23,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1757
02:18:24,574 --> 02:18:52,949
[SPEAKER_06]: with the Volus class apparently it's pretty much just a support class you can still kill things and be really awesome but it's primarily for support so if you've got a support class your vanguards can take hits really well and everybody else can do shooty things why not something in the vein of a PSO style game where you have centralized hubs you can still do massive story missions but

1758
02:18:53,945 --> 02:18:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just all the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3.

1759
02:19:01,137 --> 02:19:01,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1760
02:19:02,199 --> 02:19:04,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Okay, sorry.

1761
02:19:04,402 --> 02:19:05,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Run this by me again.

1762
02:19:05,264 --> 02:19:08,288
[SPEAKER_03]: How is this going to impact the single-player side of it, though, with the expansion?

1763
02:19:09,534 --> 02:19:10,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I made a comment.

1764
02:19:35,011 --> 02:19:39,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And who knows if the Elcor and the Hanar don't show up sometime down the line.

1765
02:19:39,393 --> 02:19:40,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see something happen.

1766
02:20:02,381 --> 02:20:16,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Avolis, I have one if you want to, we can do a match together after the show if you want to see how they play, would be terrible support for a Vanguard because I couldn't stay close enough to you.

1767
02:20:16,765 --> 02:20:20,026
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't hop over cover, so they have to actually run around the map.

1768
02:20:20,446 --> 02:20:23,907
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of adorable in a really weird way.

1769
02:20:23,927 --> 02:20:29,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, if a Vanguard biotic charges and fucks off, I'm going to have to run to your ass to refresh your shields and that's not going to work.

1770
02:20:30,410 --> 02:20:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all I do as my Vanguard.

1771
02:20:32,331 --> 02:20:33,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I just fly around.

1772
02:20:33,751 --> 02:20:36,312
[SPEAKER_03]: But you with my Sentinel worked out all right, actually.

1773
02:20:36,372 --> 02:20:36,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did.

1774
02:20:37,052 --> 02:20:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: We duoed, what, wave four, wave five?

1775
02:20:38,812 --> 02:20:41,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now my Sentinel was only level four, so that was pretty good.

1776
02:20:41,593 --> 02:20:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was collectors too, right?

1777
02:20:43,294 --> 02:20:43,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was.

1778
02:20:44,934 --> 02:20:45,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Which are super fun.

1779
02:20:45,875 --> 02:20:48,735
[SPEAKER_03]: They're bastards is what they are.

1780
02:20:48,775 --> 02:20:54,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Commander Shepard just joined our chat room and said, Hi, I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite Mass Effect podcast on the Citadel.

1781
02:20:56,053 --> 02:20:56,553
[SPEAKER_06]: If only.

1782
02:20:57,294 --> 02:20:57,794
[SPEAKER_06]: You jerk.

1783
02:20:57,934 --> 02:20:58,254
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1784
02:20:58,935 --> 02:20:59,955
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll happen eventually.

1785
02:21:00,015 --> 02:21:13,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything non... Well, actually, let me ask you this question because whenever people bring up Mass Effect podcast in chat, Black Wolf likes to chime in and say there's not enough content out there to substantiate a weekly podcast.

1786
02:21:13,543 --> 02:21:14,704
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lie now, though.

1787
02:21:15,144 --> 02:21:16,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally a lie.

1788
02:21:16,165 --> 02:21:16,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1789
02:21:16,485 --> 02:21:18,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cop-out answer because...

1790
02:21:19,059 --> 02:21:42,238
[SPEAKER_06]: every like okay there is fan fiction there's fan works like art music there are books that have been out comics that have been out multiplayer updates that come out always speculation going on for the next games you it's there's enough content there for weekly episodes for sure well then you need to produce a pilot sir and prove everybody wrong

1791
02:21:44,403 --> 02:21:48,350
[SPEAKER_06]: But how am I supposed to do that and play Pokemon in Mass Effect and WoW?

1792
02:21:48,690 --> 02:21:48,971
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1793
02:21:49,071 --> 02:21:51,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And watch Once Upon a Time in Walking Dead.

1794
02:21:52,521 --> 02:21:58,667
[SPEAKER_03]: You just gave me an excellent opportunity to transition away from Mass Effect for a minute because you've been playing Pokemon Black 2, White 2.

1795
02:21:59,068 --> 02:22:05,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you are an almost 30-year-old playing Pokemon games.

1796
02:22:06,395 --> 02:22:11,520
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the original VOG articles was about your love of Pokemon and how you're a little old for it.

1797
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:15,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are the new games and why do you still love this series?

1798
02:22:16,587 --> 02:22:30,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll never not love this series they're just really fun RPGs and the Pokemon for the most part are adorable and who doesn't want to collect adorable things PETA that game was really fun I played it

1799
02:22:32,128 --> 02:22:32,629
[SPEAKER_05]: They're good.

1800
02:22:32,949 --> 02:22:34,331
[SPEAKER_05]: They contract good programmers.

1801
02:22:34,351 --> 02:22:36,073
[SPEAKER_06]: They really are good.

1802
02:22:37,755 --> 02:22:39,337
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's just... I don't know.

1803
02:22:39,637 --> 02:22:40,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just fun.

1804
02:22:40,718 --> 02:22:48,588
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I'm going to see my friends up near Kansas City this weekend, and we're going to have a Pokemon tournament, I was just informed.

1805
02:22:48,648 --> 02:22:49,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, oh, heck yes.

1806
02:22:49,949 --> 02:22:52,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're my age, too, and they're all excited.

1807
02:22:53,661 --> 02:22:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I love this comment from Frisbee in the chat room talking about Shane's Mass Effect podcast, I'm assuming.

1808
02:23:00,084 --> 02:23:06,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee says, there's fan fiction, fan art, fan wank, fan dango, etc.

1809
02:23:09,349 --> 02:23:13,891
[SPEAKER_05]: There are Skyrim podcasts that are still going just because of all the mods that you can talk about.

1810
02:23:14,171 --> 02:23:15,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright, alright.

1811
02:23:16,072 --> 02:23:18,474
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf says, five weeks in a row.

1812
02:23:19,414 --> 02:23:20,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Five weeks in a row.

1813
02:23:20,294 --> 02:23:23,076
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta have a show that's got five episodes and then...

1814
02:23:23,416 --> 02:23:27,420
[SPEAKER_06]: What if I make five episodes in one night and then spread them out over five weeks?

1815
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:28,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people do that.

1816
02:23:30,083 --> 02:23:32,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't say that's what you're doing in advance, dummy.

1817
02:23:32,866 --> 02:23:34,547
[SPEAKER_06]: That was hypothetical.

1818
02:23:34,587 --> 02:23:36,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would I cheat like that?

1819
02:23:39,150 --> 02:23:40,511
[SPEAKER_03]: As I write this down.

1820
02:23:42,812 --> 02:23:44,113
[SPEAKER_03]: What else was I going to ask you?

1821
02:23:44,173 --> 02:23:47,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, with Pokemon, I know you're playing a lot of WoW.

1822
02:23:47,055 --> 02:23:48,596
[SPEAKER_03]: How's pet battles going for you?

1823
02:23:49,536 --> 02:23:53,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I have stopped pet battling because I'm trying to level things and get gear.

1824
02:23:53,619 --> 02:23:57,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's like a terrible addiction.

1825
02:23:57,701 --> 02:24:00,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm trying to cut myself off cold turkey at the moment.

1826
02:24:00,263 --> 02:24:01,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still think about it every so often.

1827
02:24:02,004 --> 02:24:05,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And when somebody posts that they got a new pet, I'm like, I wonder how that would be in battle.

1828
02:24:06,772 --> 02:24:09,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm just not doing anything with it.

1829
02:24:11,633 --> 02:24:16,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we let you go for the night, is there any message you want to give to horde tanks out there that might be listening?

1830
02:24:17,555 --> 02:24:19,155
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was going to say anyway.

1831
02:24:19,635 --> 02:24:20,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad you brought that up.

1832
02:24:21,536 --> 02:24:31,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a horde tank, preferably a paladin or a warrior, and you would like a fun, laid-back raid group that wants to do content while it's current,

1833
02:24:32,839 --> 02:24:44,960
[SPEAKER_06]: please please please server transfer to Proudmoore and get a hold of somebody in the guild Malevolence and we'll find you a home and we won't make fun of you much I promise

1834
02:24:46,690 --> 02:24:49,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's it.

1835
02:24:50,572 --> 02:24:51,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else before I let you go?

1836
02:24:54,153 --> 02:24:55,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

1837
02:24:55,653 --> 02:25:02,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, except I was very sad because, Alan, you talked about a Kaden and Shepard fanfic I hadn't read yet and I don't know where to find it.

1838
02:25:04,091 --> 02:25:07,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I can dig it up.

1839
02:25:08,015 --> 02:25:11,037
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't have any fix saved to a folder on my hard drive.

1840
02:25:11,077 --> 02:25:12,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know what time my user wrote it.

1841
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:23,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any fix, but I definitely have fun, awesome pictures I found that aren't porn, so I have to make that distinction before it gets a lot out of hand.

1842
02:25:23,408 --> 02:25:26,471
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as no genitalia is showing, it's not porn.

1843
02:25:27,151 --> 02:25:27,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there isn't, no.

1844
02:25:28,474 --> 02:25:29,637
[SPEAKER_06]: There's none whatsoever.

1845
02:25:29,858 --> 02:25:31,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be weird anyway to have.

1846
02:25:32,384 --> 02:25:34,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm ending this conversation before it gets awkward.

1847
02:25:34,930 --> 02:25:35,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

1848
02:25:35,411 --> 02:25:36,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it awkward.

1849
02:25:36,694 --> 02:25:36,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1850
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:42,754
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

1851
02:25:43,694 --> 02:25:45,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was another Twitter topic.

1852
02:25:45,636 --> 02:25:47,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any last-minute stories, Loki, while I bring this one up?

1853
02:25:48,277 --> 02:25:48,998
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1854
02:25:49,398 --> 02:25:52,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the EA one, but somebody took it.

1855
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:53,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody took it.

1856
02:25:53,741 --> 02:25:55,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we got another call coming in, so hooray for that.

1857
02:25:55,862 --> 02:25:56,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1858
02:25:56,883 --> 02:25:57,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1859
02:25:57,743 --> 02:25:58,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, it's Ranma.

1860
02:25:58,704 --> 02:25:59,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ranma.

1861
02:25:59,204 --> 02:25:59,664
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?

1862
02:26:01,465 --> 02:26:02,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow, my feet.

1863
02:26:03,246 --> 02:26:05,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, you're calling in to talk about New York Comic Con, I bet.

1864
02:26:06,263 --> 02:26:13,487
[SPEAKER_01]: More or less, I was actually calling in to kind of agree with the whole pirating thing, because even in my fandom, we have to deal with it.

1865
02:26:13,887 --> 02:26:19,350
[SPEAKER_01]: We call the people that bootleg the anime and stuff, we call them spoiled entitlement bitches.

1866
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:24,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, and just because they're spoiled and entitled?

1867
02:26:24,836 --> 02:26:37,582
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel that because it comes out in Japan, they can download the fan subs and watch all the episodes and decide not to buy it when it comes released here because they feel that, I already have it, why should I go out and buy it?

1868
02:26:40,019 --> 02:26:49,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I can feel that because I was about to say when you started your thought, I was like, oh, because I was kind of like that for a while because like I and I've admitted to this in the show in the past.

1869
02:26:49,343 --> 02:26:55,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I have downloaded games that were released in Japan only because I feel if the game companies aren't going to bother.

1870
02:26:55,845 --> 02:26:59,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also done it with games that were only put out in Europe before they were announced for the America.

1871
02:27:00,367 --> 02:27:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guilty of doing that too

1872
02:27:27,725 --> 02:27:32,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they release the American versions of DDR, I buy every single one of them.

1873
02:27:33,050 --> 02:27:35,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So did I. So, you know, to be fair.

1874
02:27:35,572 --> 02:27:47,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little different than your scenario because you're saying they watch it and then when they release it in America, the Americanized version, or I mean, I guess not really the Americanized version, but the, you know, whatever they end up putting out here, they fuck off.

1875
02:27:48,202 --> 02:28:17,195
[SPEAKER_01]: but also on the same token they do it because they can and let's say the series just comes out in the US and the DVDs are like 40 bucks for an entire box set people will go and buy that 40 dollar box set, rip the episodes and put them online they'll even put the full disc online and people will find them and download them because they can well and that's the same thing with games right some pirates do it because they can

1876
02:28:18,065 --> 02:28:38,543
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like I said if Halo 4 comes out at $19.99 it'll still be pirated because they want to save that $20 and that same person that doesn't want to drop $19.99 on a game will go buy a spindle of blanks to spread to make copies to give to their friends what's this comment you just made in chat Alan that's somewhat on topic with all this

1877
02:28:39,844 --> 02:28:46,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was just saying, back in the late 90s, early 2000s, I used to order fan subs from anime all the time.

1878
02:28:47,390 --> 02:28:49,011
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's what he's talking about.

1879
02:28:49,392 --> 02:28:51,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically Sailor Moon.

1880
02:28:51,874 --> 02:28:58,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, partially, and it's become where the companies will contact the fan servers and ask them not to continue with this.

1881
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:01,361
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them will be like, sure, no problem.

1882
02:29:01,641 --> 02:29:07,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are like, you know what, fuck you, we're going to continue to fan sub it because we do a better job than you can.

1883
02:29:07,489 --> 02:29:17,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, a lot of times when a fan subber got a cease and desist, that was great news for the community because the only reason why the company was doing that is because we bought the rights to this show.

1884
02:29:17,540 --> 02:29:21,544
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out next year and then the community would be happy because, yay, they were finally getting it.

1885
02:29:22,062 --> 02:29:26,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, um, Alan, to also go with that, same thing happened when Fullmetal Alchemist came out.

1886
02:29:27,266 --> 02:29:36,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Since Square Enix pretty much helped put it out in Japan, when Funimation picked it up, Square Enix told them, you gotta translate this pretty much word for word.

1887
02:29:36,694 --> 02:29:38,896
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't mishap anything here or there.

1888
02:29:39,216 --> 02:29:43,539
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working on it, sending out the CNDs to all the fansubbers, telling them, oh, they can't do this.

1889
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:44,720
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, sure, why?

1890
02:29:45,620 --> 02:30:14,592
[SPEAKER_01]: or Leo will step back some of those fansubbers will go behind their backs and continue fansubbing the series under a different title and a CND goes to them and so on and so forth and so forth well Ranma I don't want to burn all the time talking about Piracy well no it's fine it's a good conversation but I want to hear about a New York Comic Con because I hear Travis was there too and Critical Myth I think was there too I didn't see Critical Myth but I did run into the one and only Travis Donovan

1891
02:30:14,963 --> 02:30:15,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you?

1892
02:30:15,744 --> 02:30:16,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the first time you met him?

1893
02:30:17,285 --> 02:30:17,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1894
02:30:17,745 --> 02:30:21,668
[SPEAKER_01]: He freaked the fuck out when I walked up to him with my big old afro.

1895
02:30:24,770 --> 02:30:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

1896
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:28,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did you do and see in New York Comic Con?

1897
02:30:29,033 --> 02:30:29,694
[SPEAKER_03]: What was there to do?

1898
02:30:30,796 --> 02:30:32,237
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly went for the cosplays.

1899
02:30:32,377 --> 02:30:34,157
[SPEAKER_01]: The exhibition hall was ginormous.

1900
02:30:35,018 --> 02:30:49,823
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a few indie games there, but big games that were there was the Capcom booth showing off Darkstalkers Resurrection, and then there was the Halo 4 booth, and then further down there was Square Enix's new Tomb Raider game.

1901
02:30:50,994 --> 02:30:52,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow, I didn't realize they were going to be there.

1902
02:30:52,574 --> 02:30:52,994
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

1903
02:30:53,615 --> 02:31:03,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I wasn't able to check out any of these games because Comic-Con decided to give just me press and the rest of my staffers no press access at all.

1904
02:31:03,436 --> 02:31:03,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Dope.

1905
02:31:04,457 --> 02:31:07,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the lines were like three and four hours long.

1906
02:31:07,857 --> 02:31:12,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even get up in there time to try out the Wii U. Oh, that sucks.

1907
02:31:13,178 --> 02:31:13,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

1908
02:31:14,758 --> 02:31:15,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.

1909
02:31:15,279 --> 02:31:17,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just try to get over to Nintendo World later this week.

1910
02:31:18,228 --> 02:31:26,324
[SPEAKER_03]: well since I know you're all about the cosplay which I know the listeners can hear more about on Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights on VOG what was some of the good cosplay you saw?

1911
02:31:28,204 --> 02:31:32,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, believe it or not, I've seen some pretty good My Little Pony cosplays.

1912
02:31:32,966 --> 02:31:33,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1913
02:31:33,987 --> 02:31:34,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

1914
02:31:34,947 --> 02:31:40,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Comic-Con is just comics, manga, pop culture, everything all together.

1915
02:31:40,470 --> 02:31:41,930
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's come down to.

1916
02:31:42,330 --> 02:31:49,233
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I did see a couple of good Master Chief cosplays running around, but one of the most popular one was Scott Pilgrim.

1917
02:31:50,094 --> 02:31:50,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

1918
02:31:54,082 --> 02:32:00,226
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolfInChat says Ranma's met two VOG people for the first time in the span of a month because you met Bobby last month, huh?

1919
02:32:00,666 --> 02:32:12,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when I finally got to the hotel and rested up he shows up in his awesome car and we head on over to Waffle House and chilled As long as I'm still your favorite Oh, you know that

1920
02:32:15,347 --> 02:32:18,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then Travis is going to make you take that back on his show later on.

1921
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:20,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that always the case, you know?

1922
02:32:21,791 --> 02:32:23,012
[SPEAKER_03]: PAX East is coming up.

1923
02:32:23,272 --> 02:32:27,715
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one thing we didn't bring up on tonight's show, I just realized, but we should probably address.

1924
02:32:28,016 --> 02:32:28,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the thing.

1925
02:32:28,756 --> 02:32:29,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We could talk about it.

1926
02:32:29,877 --> 02:32:33,960
[SPEAKER_03]: PAX East badges went on sale, and then we can mention, oh, but they're already gone.

1927
02:32:35,785 --> 02:32:36,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Get me started on that.

1928
02:32:37,386 --> 02:32:40,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I am so pissed and aggravated about that whole situation.

1929
02:32:40,727 --> 02:32:41,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1930
02:32:41,708 --> 02:32:42,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you get a ticket?

1931
02:32:43,308 --> 02:32:44,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my brother got me a ticket.

1932
02:32:45,049 --> 02:32:47,690
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got home, I got Jovi's ticket.

1933
02:32:47,710 --> 02:32:49,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I got her a Friday, Saturday, Sunday badge.

1934
02:32:49,771 --> 02:32:50,792
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the only way.

1935
02:32:51,312 --> 02:32:56,935
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people behind PAX let people buy as many badges as they want.

1936
02:32:57,375 --> 02:32:59,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they went directly to eBay.

1937
02:32:59,476 --> 02:33:01,917
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the three-day ticket sold out in 24 hours.

1938
02:33:02,017 --> 02:33:02,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, lame.

1939
02:33:03,157 --> 02:33:03,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty bad.

1940
02:33:05,005 --> 02:33:09,148
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go, I'm telling you, you better get a Friday, Saturday, Sunday because I don't know about you.

1941
02:33:10,408 --> 02:33:14,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you want to go on eBay and try to drop three bills on a three-day badge.

1942
02:33:14,611 --> 02:33:16,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's not good.

1943
02:33:18,313 --> 02:33:20,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It really couldn't have happened on a worse week for me.

1944
02:33:21,054 --> 02:33:21,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't buy a badge.

1945
02:33:22,135 --> 02:33:27,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I am crossing my fingers and toes that our existence can justify at least one media pass.

1946
02:33:28,138 --> 02:33:28,878
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

1947
02:33:28,998 --> 02:33:36,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be more than happy to interview developers and have VOG articles and coverage on the shows and YouTubes and all that stuff.

1948
02:33:37,761 --> 02:33:40,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Just hopefully that'll work out because otherwise I ain't going.

1949
02:33:41,603 --> 02:33:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: But this was just like after I spent a disgusting amount of money on Rocky Horror.

1950
02:33:46,304 --> 02:33:49,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ask Alan, although it might be a little bit of a stressful point.

1951
02:33:49,646 --> 02:33:51,606
[SPEAKER_03]: But I spent a lot of money on that shit.

1952
02:33:51,686 --> 02:33:53,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't have money for badges.

1953
02:33:53,755 --> 02:33:54,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, I understand.

1954
02:33:54,696 --> 02:33:56,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Rocky Horror, that's your fandom.

1955
02:33:56,379 --> 02:33:57,060
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your baby.

1956
02:33:57,080 --> 02:33:58,101
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your pride and joy.

1957
02:33:59,002 --> 02:34:03,668
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say anything about that because if it was something of a hobby of mine like that, I would have done the same thing.

1958
02:34:03,889 --> 02:34:04,409
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1959
02:34:04,870 --> 02:34:06,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent a lot of money on VOG too.

1960
02:34:07,894 --> 02:34:09,937
[SPEAKER_03]: And these podcasts have a lot of

1961
02:34:10,217 --> 02:34:10,777
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so weird.

1962
02:34:10,817 --> 02:34:10,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1963
02:34:37,043 --> 02:34:39,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So weird, but all right, it is what it is.

1964
02:34:39,543 --> 02:34:40,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't my con.

1965
02:34:40,664 --> 02:34:41,444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good con.

1966
02:34:41,504 --> 02:34:44,044
[SPEAKER_03]: When the con gets here, everybody that gets to go will have a good time.

1967
02:34:44,444 --> 02:34:47,525
[SPEAKER_03]: BlizzCon ain't any better with the way they do it.

1968
02:34:48,565 --> 02:34:55,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, the most important part is the fact that I secured two rooms for everybody so we have a place to stay.

1969
02:34:55,947 --> 02:35:00,367
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the most important thing, and we got hotel space from Thursday to Sunday.

1970
02:35:00,847 --> 02:35:01,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're the bomb.

1971
02:35:01,608 --> 02:35:03,828
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm able to get a media badge, I'm going to be like, right.

1972
02:35:06,129 --> 02:35:10,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case, when you come down, me and Jovi will head on over to the airport and pick you up.

1973
02:35:11,577 --> 02:35:13,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're the bestest.

1974
02:35:14,060 --> 02:35:14,501
[SPEAKER_01]: We try.

1975
02:35:14,741 --> 02:35:16,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I should let you go so we can go wrap the show.

1976
02:35:17,385 --> 02:35:18,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, take care, bro.

1977
02:35:18,286 --> 02:35:18,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, bye.

1978
02:35:21,303 --> 02:35:22,364
[SPEAKER_03]: See, Ranma's got my back.

1979
02:35:23,145 --> 02:35:23,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm his favorite.

1980
02:35:24,145 --> 02:35:25,106
[SPEAKER_03]: We already established this.

1981
02:35:25,927 --> 02:35:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that, Bobby.

1982
02:35:26,787 --> 02:35:27,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

1983
02:35:27,808 --> 02:35:29,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby's going to be at PAX, too.

1984
02:35:29,069 --> 02:35:31,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he's going, so who knows?

1985
02:35:31,591 --> 02:35:39,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's kind of cool, because since PAX Prime is the same weekend as DragonCon, at least we get to have a little bit of PAX in our lives.

1986
02:35:39,337 --> 02:35:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I shouldn't say that PAX East is less than PAX Prime.

1987
02:35:42,841 --> 02:35:52,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the timing of PAX Prime with the exception of the fact that it's the same weekend as DragonCon I like the timing of PAX Prime a little more than PAX East but I know we'll have a good time at PAX East

1988
02:35:54,105 --> 02:36:16,364
[SPEAKER_03]: If I get to go Anyhow, I think that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight Because those were some long calls But thank you guys so much To those that called in If for whatever reason you weren't able to get through tonight Do send us an email Because we're always short on emails Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com One more Twitter topic here I want to read about And it has to do with Wing Commander So it's worth mentioning

1989
02:36:16,984 --> 02:36:18,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Weren't you a fan of Wing Commander back in the day, Alan?

1990
02:36:18,766 --> 02:36:18,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1991
02:36:18,926 --> 02:36:19,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I was.

1992
02:36:19,866 --> 02:36:20,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, get this.

1993
02:36:20,747 --> 02:36:23,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is another tweet from Tigerclaw.

1994
02:36:23,689 --> 02:36:29,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Wing Commander and Privateer creator Chris Roberts announced a new game called Star Citizen.

1995
02:36:29,213 --> 02:36:30,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we talk about this earlier?

1996
02:36:30,393 --> 02:36:30,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we?

1997
02:36:30,954 --> 02:36:31,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1998
02:36:34,474 --> 02:36:35,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about it if we did.

1999
02:36:35,695 --> 02:36:35,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It was in chat.

2000
02:36:36,015 --> 02:36:36,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we talked about it on the show.

2001
02:36:37,016 --> 02:36:39,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was on Bobby's show at the end.

2002
02:36:39,538 --> 02:36:40,639
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't on our show.

2003
02:36:40,919 --> 02:36:41,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2004
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:42,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

2005
02:36:42,721 --> 02:36:44,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, then I'm saying it twice.

2006
02:36:44,082 --> 02:36:44,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Wing Commander.

2007
02:36:44,823 --> 02:36:45,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Deal.

2008
02:36:47,685 --> 02:36:50,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Star Citizen from Chris Roberts is happening.

2009
02:36:51,007 --> 02:36:51,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Kickstarter.

2010
02:36:52,148 --> 02:36:53,268
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a crowdfunded game.

2011
02:36:53,628 --> 02:37:00,491
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's already raised $455,000 with the crowdfunding.

2012
02:37:00,531 --> 02:37:01,571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

2013
02:37:02,832 --> 02:37:05,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably going to make at least a million.

2014
02:37:05,493 --> 02:37:09,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can look for the return of Wing Commander, even though it's not called Wing Commander.

2015
02:37:09,494 --> 02:37:10,995
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's from the same guy.

2016
02:37:11,055 --> 02:37:13,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously it has a spaceship-based name.

2017
02:37:13,156 --> 02:37:15,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be the next evolution.

2018
02:37:16,377 --> 02:37:16,978
[SPEAKER_03]: of that series.

2019
02:37:17,038 --> 02:37:18,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it will turn out better than the movie.

2020
02:37:18,659 --> 02:37:24,043
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I almost backed that Obsidian one and then I realized that the game's not coming out until 2014, so I was like, fuck that.

2021
02:37:26,145 --> 02:37:27,146
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a long way away.

2022
02:37:27,406 --> 02:37:28,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna wait.

2023
02:37:30,208 --> 02:37:32,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that wraps up.

2024
02:37:32,310 --> 02:37:35,432
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have no other stories for us, Alan, I don't know if you have anything.

2025
02:37:35,533 --> 02:37:37,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any links or anything, but I have something quick.

2026
02:37:38,115 --> 02:37:38,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

2027
02:37:39,676 --> 02:37:44,200
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who are in my age group who remember a show called Syphil and Ollie on MTV.

2028
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:45,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes!

2029
02:37:46,101 --> 02:37:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're back, and they're on the Machinima channel reviewing fake video games, and it's like they never left.

2030
02:37:53,606 --> 02:38:02,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, because I think this happened a couple weeks ago when the first one showed up, and I don't remember if we brought it up on the show or what, but yes, it is hilarious.

2031
02:38:02,632 --> 02:38:07,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in the mid and late 90s, MTV did stop showing a lot of music videos.

2032
02:38:08,576 --> 02:38:08,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Siflinali

2033
02:38:31,013 --> 02:38:32,214
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, they're back.

2034
02:38:32,995 --> 02:38:43,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Liam, the guy who invented them and wrote them and does the voices was on the Nerdist podcast and he was talking, Chris Hardwick was like, I wish the Nerdist channel had snagged him up.

2035
02:38:44,106 --> 02:38:46,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, he's on, Sifl and Ollie are on Machinima.

2036
02:38:47,109 --> 02:38:47,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

2037
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:48,631
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good for lulls.

2038
02:38:49,124 --> 02:38:52,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, episode one has 92,000 views.

2039
02:38:52,248 --> 02:38:52,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too bad.

2040
02:38:53,369 --> 02:38:53,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too bad.

2041
02:38:54,911 --> 02:38:55,232
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2042
02:38:55,552 --> 02:38:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.

2043
02:38:56,814 --> 02:38:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2044
02:38:59,117 --> 02:39:05,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys who tuned in and support Orange Lounge Radio tonight, whether it be through the podcast or on Stitcher or wherever.

2045
02:39:06,326 --> 02:39:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're tuning in live, a big thank you for sticking through all the upsies and downsies of the stream.

2046
02:39:12,131 --> 02:39:13,592
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like we've been okay for the past hour.

2047
02:39:13,832 --> 02:39:18,797
[SPEAKER_03]: People stopped complaining in part B, so I guess it was just for 30 minutes there or so where it was a little rough.

2048
02:39:18,817 --> 02:39:20,178
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you guys for sticking with it.

2049
02:39:20,218 --> 02:39:22,180
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate you guys, your troopers.

2050
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:43,106
[SPEAKER_03]: if you like what you hear here at Orange Launch Radio remember we don't ask for your money to do this shit all we ask is help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio tell a friend or two or leave us a nice review on something like iTunes or a recommendation on Stitcher or TuneIn or any other site wherever you heard of this show there are plenty of other people looking for something like this so word of mouth is great

2051
02:39:45,047 --> 02:39:46,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2052
02:39:46,888 --> 02:39:50,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, as always, thank you for pinch-hitting his host tonight, especially on such short notice.

2053
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:51,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Really appreciate it.

2054
02:39:51,831 --> 02:39:58,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad we could have you on, even if you do live here and you usually get picked on anyway, but you're always great to have on.

2055
02:39:58,454 --> 02:39:59,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a final thought for listeners tonight?

2056
02:40:00,155 --> 02:40:00,235
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2057
02:40:01,796 --> 02:40:02,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye!

2058
02:40:02,676 --> 02:40:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired.

2059
02:40:03,396 --> 02:40:03,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on a nap.

2060
02:40:04,037 --> 02:40:05,177
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't nap at 9 o'clock.

2061
02:40:05,217 --> 02:40:06,077
[SPEAKER_05]: That's called going to bed.

2062
02:40:06,237 --> 02:40:08,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called going to bed and then you're like a senior citizen.

2063
02:40:09,118 --> 02:40:11,578
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go to IHOP and get a senior citizen special?

2064
02:40:11,759 --> 02:40:12,959
[SPEAKER_03]: One piece of bacon and a pancake?
