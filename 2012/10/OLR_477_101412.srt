00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
George, Lounge, Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Tonight, October 14th, 2012, an upcoming holiday game is leaked a month early, Valve is looking for some hardware testers, and could you soon feel temperature in your PlayStation controller?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 477 for October the 14th of 2012.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at vognetwork.com to talk about video games and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sadly not with us tonight, yet again, DarkSakura, not here in studio, which I know a lot of you in the chat room might be going, wait a minute, she's right here.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well that's the magic of the internet you see. She's sick today. She caught Disneyland plague or something. She caught the gay.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She went to gay days at Disneyland and wouldn't you know it, she walked away with a horrific case of the gay.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And so she will not be here tonight, but she is in chat if you wish to say hello and feel better and so forth.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Anyhow, with us tonight in studio we do have Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? I'm alright. I have a cold.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You have a cold, but it's not the gay. It's not the gay. Alright. The gay doesn't make you all stuffed up, I don't think.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know, I definitely have the gay because I'm sounding a little sick today, but I just blew out my voice over on Friday, but I'll talk about that later.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Anyhow, also say hello too. We have a guest host here. We love it when he's available and on standby. Say hello to Alan.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's me again. How are you again? I'm good. What's new with you since the last time we talked to you?

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Not much. Working, working a lot. I wanted to pinch hit last week, but I had to work. My amazing boss got me the day off.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You gotta make the money. There you go. And so actually it looks like your horrible terrible boss is in chat right now if you want to say a few words. Not kidding.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm giving him a hard time on purpose.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, um, let's see. What else do I need to plug here at the top of the show? Oh yes, be sure you listen to us live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Or VOG Network dot com. Home to a variety of great geek shows. Not just video game shows. I think that's important to point out is that we do have some awesome video game shows obviously with this one and Bobby and Girls Gone Wow and Hardhouse.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We also have some non-video game shows. Things like Understation Live, Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Out of My Jam Session, etc, etc. Lots of good stuff.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So it all goes down at vognetwork.com. I was going to come with a kickoff topic tonight, but I neglected to think of something because I'm a little bit, my voice is shot tonight.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Because, and I think a lot of other shows on the network have been talking about this, Understation Live, and I just mentioned this on Bobby's show before, and I think I mentioned it on here too.

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I was asked, I was fortunate enough to be asked to be the director of the Return of the Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento, and while it went marvelous on Friday, it was very exhausting.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I also emceed the show. So I'm basically screaming obscenities into a mic in front of a crowd of 400 people, and it felt really good.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's not like what I do.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Kind of. Kind of. On this show every week. Except I could see them. I couldn't hide from them.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I could see them too.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I knew you were going to lose your voice, so get damn close to it, because when you were shouting your intro, there was a part where you literally, like, you blew your voice out. Like, we could hear. That sound wasn't like...

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, no, and I think I even cracked a joke, like, oh, I didn't mean to go into puberty on stage or something like that.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, it was like, he's not going to enjoy that the next morning.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It was bad. It was bad, but we're okay. Well, I have a crazy idea for a topic, okay? Here's a kickoff topic, my crazy last minute topic tonight.

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So we know that this is the season for video games to become movies, because I don't know what it is, but every October, well, I do know what it is.

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's the fact that October is kind of the month for Hollywood to release their crap films, which usually includes the video game movies. Like, you know, all the Resident Evil movies come out late September, October.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We're getting Silent Hill, and I'm not saying these movies are crap, but Hollywood kind of views them as crap, because they're kind of in between this summer blockbuster and Oscar nominee.

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oscar season starts at Thanksgiving.

37
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Exactly, so most video game movies end up coming out in the October season.

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, I think, you know, if they were actually supposed to be crap, they'd be coming out in January. I think that it's just a good time. I mean, the two movies that came out video game-wise this year are both kind of monster Halloween-y movies, sort of. I mean, Resident Evil's more of an action movie, but...

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But there's the Transylvania Hotel or whatever, and the Frankenweenie and all that stuff's coming out.

40
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wreck-It Ralph very soon, actually. Although, technically, it's a November movie, and I think they're just... Wreck-It Ralph, I mean, here's the thing about Wreck-It Ralph. I know we're all excited about Wreck-It Ralph, right? Because it's Disney and it's video games.

41
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, obviously, there's a great cross-section here that this show represents very well that is very excited for Wreck-It Ralph.

42
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But I think for... I'm not sure how it's gonna do in the mainstream. I think it is still kind of a risky thing for Disney, so I think that's why it's not their Thanksgiving movie or their Christmas movie.

43
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But it's kind of that odd little place. It's in a place where it will either flop horribly and disappear. I don't think that'll actually happen.

44
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Or it'll catch on and be able to sustain itself through Thanksgiving, because that's sometimes what a lot of family movies do.

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Family movies don't always have the huge opening weekend and then disappear off the map like October movies, like Paranormal Activity and stuff do.

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
These movies tend to have consistent... They're not number one, but they're number three or something four weeks in a row.

47
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And that's kind of where I think Wreck-It Ralph's gonna end up. At least I hope the movie does well.

48
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think it's gonna do better than that.

49
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The funny thing is I think it's gonna be a lot of parents who are actually into it because of all the Nintendo references and things they remember taking their kids.

50
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think it's truly a movie that's geared towards both, and there's a lot of people that are excited about that.

51
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Anyway, I got on a tangent talking about Wreck-It Ralph. What I really wanted to ask about was since we're in this time of year where we talk about video game movies and so forth,

52
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I just finished doing a stage show. So what video game do you think deserves a stage show? What video game deserves an adaptation?

53
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It doesn't have to be a musical, but think Broadway style. What video game do you think should become a full-fledged on or off-Broadway production?

54
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, they've already kind of done this as a video, but Buggy Saints Row. Because that video was hilarious. Because it was done Broadway style. And it was hilarious.

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So I'd go for that and have a bunch of people doing the artistic dancing and singing and stuff like that and have video of Saints Row being buggy.

56
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or you can even do Buggy Driver 3 because Driver 3 is probably very, very, very, very buggy. I want new music for that though.

57
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Alan, what would you want to see on Broadway?

58
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Maniac Mansion.

59
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's probably almost too easy of an answer.

60
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It was a TV show at one point, right?

61
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah. Or my troll answer is Echo the Dolphin.

62
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That wouldn't be a Broadway production so much as it would be like the tank show at SeaWorld.

63
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It'd be like Ice Capades. Someone comes out in a dolphin suit. They're swimming through rain.

64
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey, hey, hey. Are you saying that dolphins can't ice skate? Because I want to see that.

65
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, they don't have to ice skate, but they can hop up and slide across the ice and then slip back into the water.

66
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Alright, let me get some answers from our chat room. I'm gonna go with the I can't believe Alan didn't say this answer.

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Mass Effect? Hello? Should Mass Effect be a musical? Come on.

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You can't do those effects on a stage. That needs a movie.

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That would be amazing.

70
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It would not be amazing.

71
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's look at some of the answers from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

72
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Wicked says Final Fantasy 6 the opera scene. I think that's a very, you know, well, I mean technically it was an opera.

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So it's like now you're talking about the play that became the video game that became the play.

74
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's like Street Fighter 2 the movie the game type of thing.

75
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Dark Sakura is in our chat tonight saying Clu Clu Land. How would that work? Somebody would just pole dance on stage.

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Clu Clu Land would be a showgirls type thing.

77
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Irritating Stick. Katamari Damacy.

78
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh wow, that would be a hell of a stage show.

79
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's like Lion King right there. It's like some crazy, crazy stuff.

80
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Someone like they're going to come out of there and be like, did I just drop acid or something? What happened to that?

81
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Stan in our chat room says Space Channel 5 should be on Broadway.

82
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Now there you go. There is a great musical idea.

83
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That could actually work, which is kind of sad.

84
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000


85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sad in an awesome way though.

86
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's see, SSG100Matt says Parappa the Rappa.

87
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's see, Stan says in Chicago they've done a Mario Burlesque show. Same with Zelda I think.

88
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's just cosplay strippers. I mean come on, that's all that is.

89
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Burlesque show. Okay fine, let's just add some class to that. It's a fucking cosplay person stripping.

90
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey now, I have friends that do burlesque that would take a lot of offense to what you're saying right now.

91
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Good, I aim to offend everybody.

92
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You are so rude.

93
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, here's the thing. At least you can say this, if the burlesque community has done it, you know what other communities probably done it?

94
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Drag queens. So my question is, has there been a Mario or Zelda drag queen show?

95
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Alan, you used to live in the city and go to these shows. What was the craziest drag queen show you saw in the city?

96
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They were all really amazing actually. One time I went they did Ziggy Stardust album from start to finish.

97
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Smashing Pumpkins, Drag Tribute Night. It was amazing.

98
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
See, when I think of drag queens, I don't think of Smashing Pumpkins.

99
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's why San Francisco is more alternative.

100
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Oh, excuse me. San Francisco's hipster drag apparently.

101
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The whole cabaret, the greatest love of all, you're not going to find that there.

102
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Rama in the chat says, Loki, I know people that do cosplay burlesque, dude.

103
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Burlesque stripping, fine. Are we really just going to like...

104
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Are you telling me that the end of the show that they don't end up with less clothing on, therefore they are stripping off clothing? It's the same thing.

105
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Alright, let me get to a few more answers here in chat.

106
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Frisbee says they've already done a Phoenix Wright musical in Japan. There's that movie coming that I keep forgetting is like a thing.

107
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So I hope I get to see that soon.

108
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's see if there's any other... Jessica Harper from Understation Live says, Crazy Taxi. It's one hell of a taxi ride.

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Can I have a Crazy Taxi musical? There you go.

110
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I want to change my answer.

111
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, what do you want to say?

112
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Out of This World?

113
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You know that French game?

114
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, I think Jamie did that as a classic game once, yeah. Good answer.

115
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Awesome. And DJ Morpheus in chat says, I saw a peach drag queen at New York Comic Con.

116
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Actually, I got to say the peach drag queen thing has been done at several conventions. I've seen that.

117
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So, there you go. Thanks to the wonders of the internet. Whenever a dude dresses up as peach, it's always on the internet the next day.

118
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Alright, there you go.

119
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So in our kickoff topic, we managed to talk about burlex shows, drag queens, musicals, and offend people.

120
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There you go. I'd say kickoff topic well done.

121
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week.

122
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Alan, I usually let Dark Sakura start. She's not here. I'll let you start. How was your gaming week?

123
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Good. Mass Effect 3, the DLC that came out, I've been playing the hell out of that.

124
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You guys talked about it a little bit last week. The Collectors, which were the antagonists in 2, are now an enemy class that you can roll into in the multiplayer matches.

125
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I unlocked the Volus Adept, which is an ultra rare and seven unlockable character.

126
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I'm sure saying Volus Adept is the same as saying Pineapple Toaster Oven to most people in our listeners.

127
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Pineapple Toaster Oven? Awesome! I like pineapple and I like toaster ovens. Sounds amazing.

128
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I unlocked one of the new coveted secret characters.

129
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How about a toaster oven that cuts the pineapple for you? So you don't have to.

130
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I played some Black Mesa Source a little bit, but not as much as I have been because I already went through and beat it and I'm waiting for them to patch in the end of the game.

131
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mass Effect Infiltrator, because about three weeks ago I upgraded my phone. I now have a Galaxy S3.

132
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I believe Bobby Blackwolf got one about a month ago.

133
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So I downloaded the Infiltrator Mass Effect game for it.

134
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It looks gorgeous, but it controls so bad that it makes me angry that I spent the four bucks on it.

135
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It controls so poorly for me that it makes me feel like...

136
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If you've ever had someone, like you show them a game like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto and it's someone who does not play video games and you have the controller and you're like,

137
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
okay, here's how you move and here's how you get in the car and then you just drive off a cliff.

138
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The first thing you do is they just die because they don't know how to play games.

139
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Infiltrator controls so poorly that it makes me feel like I'm one of those people.

140
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And I told James about it and he has it on iPad and he said that he made himself beat it just because he has a boner for Mass Effect.

141
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And he's like, oh yeah, the game's a total piece of shit. I can't believe I beat it all the way through.

142
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I really wanted to like it. There's a lot to like about it. Like for a phone game, it looks really good.

143
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, it looks like Mass Effect. It's an over-the-shoulder action game.

144
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Because it's all with your thumbs. You just swipe to... it's horrible.

145
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Stop trying to make touch gaming happen. Like it sucks for some of these hardcore franchises.

146
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, Fruit Ninja, yes. For whatever they're doing in that game, no.

147
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's really it, I think. Oh, and Tiny Tower. I know a lot of Tiny Tower, which is like a two-year-old iPhone game.

148
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But since you're coming off having the phone that doesn't even have a QWERTY keyboard on it, too.

149
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I had the Blackberry equivalent of the Nokia brick. You know, the classic, you know, you throw the Nokia brick at a car and the car explodes.

150
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And the brick is fine. I had the Blackberry equivalent of that. And now, so going from that to this Android ice cream sandwich.

151
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ooh, you know, little laptop in your pocket is quite a change.

152
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah, in Tiny Tower, I give all of my stores perverted names. The laundromat is called the Stank Panties.

153
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I've got... the TV studio is named after a porn website, which I'm not going to say. So it's porn studio because of the name I gave it.

154
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So yeah, it's good times. Good times killer game.

155
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Now, just to fan the flames of this, what made you decide to go with the Galaxy S3 on the day the iPhone 5 came out?

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
To be pragmatic about it, you represent the Apple portion of this household, which is fine. I'm not hating on that.

157
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But it's like, if we want to be, you know, the ultimate geek duo, we need Android representation up in here so that people can come to us and they will ask Rob the Apple questions, they can ask me the Android questions.

158
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If I want to be pragmatic about it, make sure all of our braces are covered.

159
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That is the best possible answer you could have given. Good job. This is why I keep you here.

160
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So I will investigate whatever it is that you don't like.

161
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

162
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So when they ask you about the Apple stuff, like, why should I get an iPhone 5? Because it's new! You gotta get the new thing.

163
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So this week I've actually been trying to catch up on a lot of stuff that I haven't been playing because I've been playing a lot of Minecraft or whatever.

164
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So let's see. This week I played some Vita stuff. That was also another thing. I wanted to play games on the Vita because I haven't been and it was sorely neglected.

165
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So I tried out a couple demos I had. First, Gravity Rush, which was pretty cool. Just not really something, I mean, it's a good game but it's not something I'm going to be playing because I just don't want to play a lot of different games right now.

166
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I've already got plenty of my play right now but it's a unique looking game. It was fun. So I played that. I played Little Big Planet Vita. Well that was something I was like, oh, I'm probably going to get this but then I played it and it's Little Big Planet.

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's great but it's got, you know, the Vita gimmicks that you kind of expect in there and I was just kind of like, eh, it's another Little Big Planet game. Probably won't play this so I'm not going to get it.

168
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's kind of a bummer.

169
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well no, it's not that at all. It's a good game. It's just, I have Little Big Planet 2 that I haven't played. Why am I going to buy another Little Big Planet game that I probably won't play?

170
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I need to finish other games first before, you know, I'm just trying not to get into that mode of like, I need to get all these games because they're good.

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Then I'm going to be sitting on all these games that are good and not have time to play them and then more good stuff is going to come out and I'm not going to have time to play that.

172
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I ended up, you know, there's a ton of games I have that are really old that I haven't played yet like 3D Dot Game Heroes. I've lent that out to so many people and I have yet to play that game.

173
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's a good game.

174
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It is a good game. I know it's a good game but that game came out around the same time as like Red Dead Redemption or something and it was just like, ooh, Red Dead Redemption, you know, and I just kind of lost track of that.

175
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We have a new story coming up later and maybe I'll mention it to them but there's this really good, really, really good sale going on right now on a bundle of games and they're like all things that people tell me I should play and I've missed.

176
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And it's like, wow, for a very, very, very small amount of money I could like catch up on three years worth of gaming.

177
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And for that amount of money I think it's a good deal even if you don't play them because that amount of money for one of those games is so-

178
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We're getting ahead of ourselves though, sorry.

179
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The game I actually did want to play and I bought it mainly because it came out on this platform first was Retro City Rampage.

180
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I've been looking forward to this game forever now and they have the whole cross-buy thing on the PlayStation Network so you can get it for your PS3 and Vita so I bought it for my Vita and it's fantastic.

181
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If I didn't have a cold, you know, at the point when I was playing it my body was aching and my eyes were just like burning.

182
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If it wasn't for that I would probably have played a lot more of it but it's a fantastic game and there's just so many homages to everything.

183
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's just crammed full of just so much fan service and just like oh my god I remember that and even stuff that will probably fly over your head but it's a fantastic game.

184
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's just basically the best description I read for it was someone says the developers love letter to the industry for all the 8-bit games that he played and stuff like that.

185
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It even has modern references and stuff in it but the story is just throwaway. It makes no sense whatsoever but it's got everything and it's seriously a great game.

186
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I am looking forward to playing that on my PlayStation 3 hopefully but on the Vita it's still pretty awesome.

187
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Although the game does tend to make the screen a lot smaller like in different sections of the map and stuff like that.

188
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So playing on a Vita, I'm sure it's not so bad on a TV but on the Vita the screen gets really small so that might be something that might turn people off from it but it's a fun game.

189
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Especially if you like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 it's very much like that but even if you don't like Grand Theft Auto it's still a great action game with all sorts of crazy stuff in it.

190
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
From Bionic Commando to Bill and Ted to Back to the Future. It's great.

191
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And then of course more Minecraft. I played a lot more Minecraft. I fished up my castle basically.

192
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't know. Come join the server if you haven't yet.

193
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And then Call of Duty we bought Map Pack 2 so we're going to start playing some new maps because we're just kind of getting bored of the ones we were playing.

194
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Once again tried doing another streak week. Missed it by another game. Oh well.

195
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Getting close. Getting close.

196
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And what else? I think that was it actually. I think that was all the games I played.

197
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So Alan you'll get a kick out of this. You know how the live listeners will understand this. Podcast listeners I apologize for a minute but we're having these stream dropouts.

198
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It looks like it's happened twice. And yeah we just so you guys know we actually purposely left the internet off for an hour today while we went to go run errands.

199
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The cable modem and the router off for an hour.

200
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's do a complete power cycle of every damn technological thing in this house so OLR can stay up with no downtime tonight. Now we're on 2.

201
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So it's like it is not in this house. Like the problem is not in this house. The problem is Comcast on their end.

202
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Spell hey you know why you guys keep dropping our stuff.

203
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Well I wonder if it's not because sometimes I see that we're still sending data and they start complaining in chat that it dropped and I'm like it didn't drop because I see that we're still sending data.

204
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Because if Comcast goes down then our net should stop working. I should get booted from IRC. All of that should happen.

205
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So that makes me wonder is it our stream provider that's really having the issue.

206
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But it doesn't happen to Bobby.

207
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's right it doesn't happen to Bobby.

208
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He's on it for an hour.

209
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So what the hell is the problem?

210
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Could be our is he where is sorry forget it all. Where's where's where's it located. Where where are we piping to right now.

211
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's a good question that I don't know the answer to that maybe Bobby does.

212
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Because if it's in the Midwest or the South it could be our connection to there and he's you know Anna.

213
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It very well could be. Let me see if this tells me where we beam the show to because I'm actually not sure.

214
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,000


215
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I know but you know what deal with it.

216
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He says New Jersey so you would be infinitely closer.

217
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh yeah so for us if we're piping in New Jersey then there's yeah it's probably the stream weird to us.

218
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This is New Jersey so no wonder the streams oh stop it.

219
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Who else do you want to offend tonight while we're at it.

220
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We're still early and we haven't even started story.

221
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You've done burlesque people.

222
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
New Jersey not saying there's anything wrong burlesque burlesque is awesome.

223
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Because it's once again women stripping off their clothes which is you know that's fine.

224
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I think really the only difference between burlesque and strippers the strippers kind of go all the way whereas burlesque is more of the teas and stuff.

225
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yeah but they're still stripping off their clothes.

226
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
They're just they're just like you know skin Amex strippers versus you know the stripper strippers.

227
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I guess.

228
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Oh boy all right.

229
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Who spilled Jager and spray tan on the server rack.

230
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Moving on to my gaming week.

231
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I had a very dark soccer week.

232
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
My gaming week was very dark soccer.

233
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Does everybody know what that means.

234
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,000


235
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's right I played him.

236
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No no no that's that's dark soccer circa 2009 gaming week.

237
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
My gaming week this week was I played a lot of wow.

238
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I did some dailies and you know just I shouldn't say a lot of wow because I didn't play a lot of wow but I played you know because I've had weeks where I played a lot of wow.

239
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But this is not one of those weeks but I played enough wow to do like a few dailies here and there and so forth.

240
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And then I played Mass Effect 3 because as Alan mentioned the new DLC went up the multiplayer DLC and it's very well rounded.

241
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's got a whole new class of aliens that you can fight the collectors from part two.

242
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So that breathes new life into it.

243
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It has some new classes.

244
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It doesn't matter because I won't be seeing them anyway because I never get that stuff in my premium specter packs but I did finally get one of the ones I really wanted.

245
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's called Cerberus Adept and I've been playing that class a lot because he's the guy with the whips and you're just like Hulk smash Hulk smash everything and it's great.

246
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Vanguard's like that too.

247
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah it's awesome. Like we were doing a multiplayer match earlier with some friends and one of my friends was like who sent the body flying out the window.

248
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm like me. So yeah Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is still really fun and I like that they've staggered this content a bit.

249
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So like what is it every Tuesday we're going to get just a handful of new things right? Every Tuesday for a little while? That's awesome.

250
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know if they're doing it because there's 16 new kits where a kit is a character within a class.

251
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So we got four of them. There's supposed to be 16 so that's only a month's worth if they're going to do four a week.

252
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
They should probably do every other week.

253
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Maybe every other week. That would make it.

254
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Because next weekend should be the next scenario challenge because they do that every other weekend.

255
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And the other big thing they added is they have kind of like mini achievements now. Like it kind of runs on a similar system to like achievements or trophies but you're not unlocking official things.

256
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They're not game achievements. It's within the multiplayer. Like you've used biotic charge 30,000 out of 50,000 times.

257
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So when you hit the 50,000 and then you can unlock titles that appear next to your handle in game lobbies.

258
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So kind of similar to like Street Fighter IV has that kind of similar idea there.

259
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So that breathes some life into it too because it's like oh now I have all these things to work for.

260
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Because if you've been a person that's been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer since launch which there is a lot of people that have been.

261
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You've probably got all the other achievements by now. I mean there's not a lot else to work towards.

262
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Alan, heck you haven't even been playing since launch but you're in seven score is what 800 and something now?

263
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's like 820 now. It would be higher but when I do golds and silvers I'm usually on a level 20 and they don't gain XP.

264
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Oh okay. I see. Gotcha. Alright. Alright well that was my gaming week. So let's move into some housekeeping.

265
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
We are on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We are on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

266
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I believe today or tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow, is the last day to nominate us for the podcast awards.

267
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:59,000
So please for your consideration, Best Gaming Podcast and the Stitcher Awards also going on right now and I think they end either tomorrow or Friday.

268
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So please consider a nomination for us there as well for Best Gaming Podcast. If for whatever reason you don't want to vote for us that's cool.

269
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Please support one of the other shows on the VOG Network or at least bare minimum support Indie Podcast.

270
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And then Stitcher I believe it's every day or every day you can vote.

271
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You can nominate for Stitcher every day. You can. So podcast award is just one nomination.

272
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed and let you know what happens either next week or in a couple weeks when those nominations are announced.

273
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Remember you know usually I hate the whole begging for votes thing but it really is good exposure and these guys you know as much as some of these big podcasts are fine.

274
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,000
The NPR podcasts are great. Like wait wait don't tell me he's a great show. The Adam Carolla show is a fine show if you like him and all that.

275
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But the problem you know they don't need the additional exposure. They have plenty of corporate exposure and stuff so we really want to see the indies succeed in these.

276
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Because there's a lot of really good indie programs too. Just like there's good indie games.

277
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Anyhow let's move on to the news. Oh wait no one other thing I got to plug. Very important.

278
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I always like to plug the shows that are kind enough to invite me on as a guest. And I was a guest this week. I don't know how I fit this in this week but I did.

279
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I was a guest on Nerdgasm Network their gaming show. It's episode 54. I don't think it was on their feed yet when I checked because they are having some website up seas and down seas but it will be you know very soon.

280
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Nerdgasmnetwork.com so take a look for episode 54. I was on it. And I felt really bad because I had to go before they were done but it was just that kind of week last week.

281
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So hopefully they'll have me back at some point because we had some funny in-jokes that were going on there so I had a good time.

282
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So you'll hear more about putting it all out on the table and I'll just leave it at that. Alright let's get into some gaming news.

283
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And Burlesque Top I guess. Yeah yes. Actually very similar to Burlesque but in a different way. Let's move on to gaming news Loki.

284
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So it's another year so another Microsoft game has been leaked. Hurrah! Apparently Microsoft is investigating a report of Halo 4 being leaked and they're working with law enforcement to address the issue.

285
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And you know there's images being surfaced on social networking sites depicting retail discs and a dashboard featuring the game ready to play blah blah blah.

286
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
It's already leaked. Yes it's absolutely 100% been leaked. It's out there.

287
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And of course you know they're like well we're clarified with that's actually it's been leaked. 100% it's been leaked. Okay.

288
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Has it been leaked? It's been leaked. I don't know that much more you can say other than it's pretty good.

289
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And also I guess some other information. Apparently the game is going to be on two discs. The second disc is going to contain installation data for the multiplayer stuff and once you've installed that then you can actually play the game with the first disc.

290
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Kind of like Forza 4. Now Loki help me understand something. How are people able to play this game before the release date?

291
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Uhhhhh. Piracy. Oh. Okay.

292
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But piracy is bad. It is bad and they will get banned if they go online. That's it. And Microsoft called the po-po.

293
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Oh yeah. They're really investigating it. They're asking for it.

294
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Look. Obviously they're going to say you know they're going to invoke the police because and you know it is a crime. You can poo poo it all you want but stealing shit is a crime. Right?

295
00:31:46,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So but what will the police really do to investigate you think? Do you think the police is coming after little Johnny Pirate that went on the Pirate Bay and downloaded the program? Or do you think the police are looking more into how the leak happened?

296
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I think they're trying to find out how it got leaked.

297
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Well then the police aren't doing a very good job. I hate to say it but let's see Gears of War 3 leaked. Halo 3 leaked. Like every big Microsoft title leaks. Did Fable the Journey leak or did that just slip off the radar?

298
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:31,000
No. Any title like out there. Any title that's being released is leaked usually a week before it comes out. And the reason that happens is because that's how the shipment schedule is for retailers.

299
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They usually get stuff you know Monday prior or you know if it's you know direct retail partners like say GameStop and Best Fies and stuff like that. They're getting their product probably the week before on Wednesday or something.

300
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Now here's how I think this happened. And this is totally speculative. I have no...

301
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
This is not the week before. Halo's not supposed to be out till like for like three weeks.

302
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah exactly. Here's how I think it happened. Well a couple of ways. One, someone nabbed a copy when they were pressing it. You know an actual copy out of the duplicator.

303
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Or this happens occasionally. The warehouse that ships the product, the Microsoft product, will misship something and accidentally send something early. Like way earlier than they were supposed to receive it in.

304
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:36,000
For example you know personally we had some Skylanders stuff you know for the new Skylanders Giants that they accidentally shipped us earlier than it should have been. Like about a week earlier. Which is usually unusual.

305
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Well lucky you. Some lucky asshole got me Halo 4. You got Skylanders.

306
00:33:41,000 --> 00:34:01,000
No no no. We're not doing anything with Skylanders. But I'm just saying it happens. There's been Microsoft released games in the last few weeks. We had Fable and then next week we've got Dance Central 3 and then we've got Forza Horizon. So there's going to be a lot of Microsoft shipments in the next few weeks.

307
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So perhaps one of those got out and somebody unscriptedlessly bought it or got a copy and put it out there. Or who knows. It could have just been somewhere else. An employee. You never know. Because it's one of the biggest games.

308
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:33,000
This and probably Call of Duty Black Ops 2 are going to be like the ones. The scene groups out there fighting each other. Who's going to be able to release it first. And you know it's all bragging. All E-peen bragging rights basically. Like oh I'm playing Halo and you're not. So that's it.

309
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So here's the question I have to ask. How can Microsoft stop this? How can Microsoft stop that leak from happening?

310
00:34:43,000 --> 00:35:00,000
They can't. They have to be more secure about how they duplicate their game. Just the whole handling process of it. The way other publishers do it. At least they try to prevent street day violators is by delivering a product as late as possible to those retail chains.

311
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So we're talking like you know getting a day early instead of a week early. That type of thing. But obviously it's something like this. This hasn't even. I mean as far as we're aware this hasn't even hit the retail chains yet. This is just some screw up somewhere where something either got shipped way earlier than it was supposed to or someone internally leaked it out.

312
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That's the problem. But the team they have they've had problems with leaks just in the last few years all the time. I mean was it last year there was Gears of War 3. Remember that game got leaked down the Web. You know by Microsoft or I'm sorry it was a third party review company or some garbage that they were saying.

313
00:35:42,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But basically the actual source code and I or it was like the source code in something was leaked out and you can actually download it off of an unencrypted Web site or something. It was just ridiculous. So yeah it's not good but I don't think it's really going to hurt them in the end. I mean they're still going to sell a buttload of those.

314
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah I mean the reality is you kind of have to ask yourself if you're going to download one of these games and so forth. Am I the type of person that sits there and goes aw every time I hear one of these stories about game developers closing or why did Big Bad EA close such and such developer or you know so forth. Yet I'm not allowing said company to make money. You kind of can't have both right.

315
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Now I don't think people have to get paid. Yeah I don't think that's fair though. I think what you're basically saying though those are a lot of these secondary companies and stuff and some of it has nothing to do with you know how well the game sold for they need to cut profits because it didn't sell as many copies as they thought it would not necessarily because piracy ate up you know hundreds of thousands of copies.

316
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I mean because once again that's assuming that every person that pirates something would have bought the game regularly. I bet you a lot of people that pirate the game are probably just they want to play it early and they're going to still buy their preorder when it comes out or you know they were never going to buy the game in the first place and they would have pirated it when it came out.

317
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You know normally it's just that's once again you can't the industry can't just assume that each one of those is a lost sale as much as I don't want to agree with you I think I actually kind of do I think a vast number of people who pirate games were never going to buy that game in the first place.

318
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm going to tell you this much. They only download it because they can. Exactly. And you know I I did with grant the thought of four grand thought of four came out it leaked down the Internet one week before it came out. I still bought the game. I want to play it right now. I want to play it as early as possible and so I did. I played it a week early but who cares. I think I've more than paid for it. I bought what six copies of the game when it came out and it's six copies of episodes from Liberty City when it came out and six copies of the first deal.

319
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:10,000
See before you know the episodes from Liberty City stuff came out. I think they got my money. So I don't feel so bad about you know playing the game a week early. I think this is why the industry is very eager to get on digital distribution.

320
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think this is why you see some companies may be rushing digital distribution and really trying to push it more and more is because if you think about it digital distribution is a great way to curb piracy.

321
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It won't stop it but it would stop these leaks from happening because essentially you've cut out the entire process of printing the disks and the going gold and shipping and the problems there. You're cutting that all out.

322
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:46,000
No leaks out even earlier than games like this. Xbox Live arcade games. Wow. They leak out even earlier. No why. Why have access to partner net still people download them off partner net and they put them out.

323
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:59,000
They crack it and put it out. Yeah they crack and put out so digital distribute the people are going to find ways around everything. All they want to do is to cut out the mailman with that stuff so that means more profits for them. It's not going to curb more piracy people are going to find a way no matter what.

324
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I mean no matter what they put out there people are going to find a way. But a game like you know Halo 4. Yeah it's going to get part of it. I mean all the games get pirated but I don't think that they're going to sell like it's not going to be like oh crap.

325
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It didn't sell at all. That's not going to happen there. No one's going to shut down 343 studios because it didn't sell because of all piracy. It just ruined the whole game. No it's not like that. There's not that many people you know compared to the millions of people buy that pirate games is such a small section but they would want you to think it is because you know they got to blame their loss of sales on something.

326
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Do you think though that if this hadn't happened maybe they would have sold a quarter million more copies. No because if this hadn't happened it's going to leak out again when it comes out and the same people will pirate it.

327
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Rama in our chat room says Halo 4 could come out at $19.99 and yet it will be pirated. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com follows that up with iPhone piracy is rampant and that's 99 cent apps. I think that's a perfect example where it's like people do it because they can.

328
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I mean if you're given someone the option to get some free versus paying for it. Why wouldn't you get it for free. I mean I understand that there's this whole morality of oh well if I don't pay. I mean they try to push this shit on you even in legality. You are taking a risk. I understand that but it's just OK.

329
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:47,000
It's it would be like I don't know it'd be like walking into a department store and all sudden there's like hundreds of looters inside there and they all scatter in every single direction. Good luck catching every single one of those. I mean it's a risk but you know the officer is not going to be able to catch every single person.

330
00:40:47,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's kind of the same way piracy. Yeah people get nabbed every now and then but there's so many people and so much piracy happening that you know it just has a hole like over everything that you can't catch everybody. The best defense is to stop the people that upload them in the first place and then there's nothing for them to pirate.

331
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:15,000
You know what though I think I could look you in the eye with a straight face and totally mean it and say you would never catch me down there being one of those looters. I just think it's wrong.

332
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And like I would never participate in a looting event like that and I really believe that about my character like and I'm not trying to say like I'm better than anybody else or whatever but I know like they had a situation like that happen in Britain.

333
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Not that long ago like there were these huge riots and all these things and there were these looting and you know a bunch of kids got caught went to jail and all this stuff and I remember looking at it going what a bunch of fucking thugs.

334
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I wouldn't be one of those thugs. That is ridiculous that stuff. I mean my analogy was that there's how do you go after everybody. You can't. Yeah because yeah as a literal metaphor I don't really think that's the best comparison.

335
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:59,000
There's a huge difference between the plausible deniability of maybe downloading a torrent from the privacy of your own bedroom versus throwing a chair through a storefront window.

336
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Of course once again the video game industry or the movie industry would like you to think that that's exactly the same thing.

337
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yes. The great debate that will never end. But maybe this is why we see more free to play games happening because it's like fuck it. We'll make our money other way.

338
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:26,000
No seriously that's a great idea. As long as you could secure DLC. But that's a great idea because then it's like fuck pirated as much as one gives me copies out there because that's more people that can buy the DLC for it.

339
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And that's why I think it is more popular approach because it gets the game into more people's hands and more people want to try because it's free there. I if it sucks whatever I just delete it you know.

340
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And that that's why I think it is a good way to go. But then again at the same time some of these companies are getting greedy and they're taking the free to play model for their paid games and that just pissing people off even more and they're like fuck you I'm just going to not only am I going to pirate this game but I'm also going to pirate all your DLC.

341
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Alright well moving on. This piracy debate will never be settled so I'm going to go ahead in the interest of time and move on with the news.

342
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But what a great segue talking about a game that a lot of people probably just should have pirated. Let's be real it wasn't very good. No I'm kidding. I'm trolling I'm trolling.

343
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But pirated DLC and all that definitely goes with this too. It's Street Fighter X Tekken.

344
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm sorry you can't pirate something that's already on the disc.

345
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:30,000
There's a whole nother argument we could save for another day. Is it piracy when it was on the disc anyway? We'll save that for next week.

346
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Alright but moving on. This wasn't on the disc what I'm about to talk about. It's a free what they call hefty like the trash bags hefty update later this year.

347
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It is supposed to rebalance the game, provide visual and mechanical tweaks which I find interesting that they're going to actually tweak some of the visuals.

348
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Every character in Street Fighter X Tekken is supposed to get some type of balancing tweaks and so forth. Including Ken, Kazuya, Kami, Julia and so on and so on. Lots lots.

349
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Also don't forget Street Fighter X Tekken is coming to the Vita. I don't know if that means these same balancing things are already in that finished version or if there's a day one patch or whatever.

350
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But that is due on October 23rd as a reminder that's just around the corner Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.

351
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Didn't that game flop?

352
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I think flop is a strong word but I think it.

353
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Just perform as well as they'd probably hope.

354
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Word of mouth from friends who are usually like Capcom for life and just the reviews are like this is not very good.

355
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:40,000
What I'm really curious about is where's the other half of this because we were supposed to be seeing Tekken cross Street Fighter and I'm wondering.

356
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I think it's still a long way away.

357
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Namco just started working on it this year.

358
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Wow.

359
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Like began.

360
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
They already had their we're gonna Tekken tag too so.

361
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Maybe they've been kind of developing them side by side.

362
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
They have the engine now they've made the engine so it's been.

363
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
This wasn't the their joint project for this was announced what two or three years ago right.

364
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I think when they did the press release the Namcom is making one and Capcom is making one.

365
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah that was two or three years ago.

366
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But yeah no.

367
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Namco has only just now started even designing the game.

368
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So maybe next year or the year after.

369
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We'll see maybe maybe it'll be on the next generation of consoles maybe this is a PlayStation 4 game troll troll.

370
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Although yes they were busy if they wait too long it's going to have to be if they wanted to sell but anyway let's move on.

371
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:39,000
To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase crown.

372
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Do you live in the Seattle area.

373
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
If so no.

374
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:52,000
If you do you might want to head over to a valve software's website and take a little play tester survey.

375
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And see if maybe you could become a hardware tester for their valve appliance which clearly exists in some form though.

376
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
They haven't given it a name and we don't know what exactly it has a fridge.

377
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I hope it's a pineapple toaster oven.

378
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So yeah and if you are in the Seattle and Bellevue area is it is that right.

379
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
They're looking for hardware testers and there's just it's a questionnaire.

380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
How long have you been gaming.

381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Are you a completionist are you an achievement hunter.

382
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
How often do you unlock hundreds of everything.

383
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
How often do you beat like it.

384
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Do you beat completely every game that you play from start to finish.

385
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You would be qualified for this Rob.

386
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Shut up.

387
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Well you can expect people that go into this to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

388
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Up through the teeth.

389
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And you can expect that those will be broken.

390
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Wait.

391
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So from whatever however many months ago that they were looking for hardware engineers.

392
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
They have an alpha clearly that they are they want people under lock and key to go check out.

393
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Very interesting.

394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Whatever their steam box is.

395
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I look forward to what leaks out of this.

396
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Moving on Loki.

397
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Alright.

398
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So of course remember that there was the announcement that Sony has bought Gaikai.

399
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And so now Gaikai's website they've been updated to kind of resemble a little bit more of the PlayStation lineup.

400
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You see images of living planet as well as uncharted and looks like kill zone in there as well.

401
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
They have some skills from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

402
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And you know they didn't really say you know what any additional details or something.

403
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
But obviously it seems like this is something that's going to be offered as part of the PlayStation platform soon.

404
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
So you can probably expect some game streaming either by the end of this year or maybe an announcement E3.

405
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Nothing else.

406
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Unfortunately around the same time though.

407
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:04,000
So Gaikai they've kind of found themselves as part of a patent lawsuit on a Delaware company called T5 Labs.

408
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
They filed a suit against them.

409
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I guess their patent for providing a system and methods of sharing and graphics processing unit between plurality of programs.

410
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That's the patent.

411
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Now I'm not sure if this is just a patent troll company or if this is actually a company that does this stuff.

412
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But I'd be willing to bet it's probably a patent company.

413
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So they have no comment on it but there is the lawsuit in place.

414
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Is this what really put on live out of business.

415
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Because I would have thought if anybody was going to complain it would have been you know one of the other companies that deals in this you know same technology.

416
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I just you know I'm willing to bet the T5 Labs probably hasn't put anything out.

417
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You probably can't even find them on the Internet.

418
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm going to even check that out right now.

419
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Let's see T5 Labs.

420
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Let's see are they even a part of the Internet.

421
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Here we go. T5 Labs dot com and.

422
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And yeah it looks like they've got some just crappy flash animation on here.

423
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But it's implied that it has to do with games because.

424
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Because they've got static TV and it's tied to a server and what games do they make.

425
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Oh good. They have these the whole Star Wars scroll on here because that's not annoying to read.

426
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
T5 Labs enables people to play PC games on their existing set top box.

427
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:54,000
There's the service operates on the video on demand client type system and says T5 Labs patent pending technology allows the system to work on the ultra low latency.

428
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We call it instant gaming.

429
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So it well that does sound like it does seem like.

430
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Well it does seem like then that they are actually making something it's not a patent troll company.

431
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So I guess I am corrected.

432
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,000
All right. But that is is refreshing to see that they're not just a patent troll.

433
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
All right well moving on.

434
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I guess I'll troll you all by talking about Mass Effect because you know we don't shut up about that on this show.

435
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I know you're a big fan of this.

436
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Well Alan are you looking forward to the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC.

437
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Why are you so excited about that.

438
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Because it's Carrie-Anne Moss.

439
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
She's going to fucking shoot bitches in the face.

440
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
She's like fuck you. I'm Carrie-Anne Moss.

441
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Like Carrie-Anne Moss was in the Matrix which was cool like 12 years ago.

442
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
She was also the mom in that Shayla Buff movie and I saw that.

443
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Oh and she I think she's in the new Silent Hill movie as well actually.

444
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Okay.

445
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Yeah I think she's one of the crazy cool I think she plays the villainess I think.

446
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Yeah.

447
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So where was the Borg Queen last time. This time it's Carrie-Anne Moss.

448
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
There you go.

449
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Well anyhow I suggest you do not fuck with Aria in the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC.

450
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Which they are saying will be double the size of Leviathan.

451
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Leviathan wasn't that big of a DLC campaign though.

452
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It really wasn't.

453
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Now Lair of the Shadow Broker is still the one that they need to beat as far as quality and length.

454
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Because Lair of the Shadow Broker in Mass Effect 2 was a badass campaign from start to finish.

455
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Yeah Lair of the Shadow Broker was great.

456
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000
And especially if Omega is going to be kind of like a hub like the Shadow Broker Lair was that you got into.

457
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Yeah.

458
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
That would be great.

459
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Omega was probably one of the best design places in the entire trilogy.

460
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Because if you're a science fiction geek like I am a lot of the design was based off of, oh I'm blanking.

461
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Harrison Ford in the 80s. Blade Runner.

462
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
A lot of Omega is based off a lot of the scenes in Blade Runner.

463
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And the music was amazing and I'm really glad that we're revisiting this place in 3.

464
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Also the big news about this DLC.

465
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Female Turians for the first time you're going to see.

466
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yeah.

467
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Now.

468
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Fans are wary.

469
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
There's always the comic books and so forth where they've shown up.

470
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
But the first time in the game is certainly a big deal.

471
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Yeah.

472
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
The fans of course want to see.

473
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
When you say the fans you mean who?

474
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Tumblr?

475
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
BioWare forms?

476
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
All of that.

477
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
The fandom.

478
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Because a lot of people want to see female Turians because the entire trilogy.

479
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
How do Turians have sex?

480
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Because clearly they're all men everywhere.

481
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,000
People are worried that they're just going to put a Turian head on tits armor.

482
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And be like, there it is.

483
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
They're fucking reptiles they shouldn't have tits.

484
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Thanks BioWare.

485
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm interested to see what they do.

486
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
And when you're talking about all of it you've researched the fandom through extensive online research right?

487
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yes.

488
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I track Mass Effect tags on Tumblr.

489
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And what sorts of things do you participate with in the fandom?

490
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I just reblog stuff and favorite stuff.

491
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Have you ever written a fanfic?

492
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
No.

493
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
No I don't.

494
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Have you ever read a fanfic?

495
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I've read some hot M. Shenko stuff.

496
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
What was your favorite M. Shenko?

497
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I think it was Caden was jogging through the citadel in booty shorts.

498
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And everyone was catcalling him and Shepard was all flustered and offended.

499
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Caden was like, I don't know.

500
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I can't believe you actually had an answer for that.

501
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
That's great.

502
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Anyhow, just trolling you live on air.

503
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Anyhow, also apparently about this new DLC, one of Mass Effect 2's characters, Zaid Masani,

504
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
is supposed to return in this.

505
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I don't remember him being in 3.

506
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
No, he was in 1 quest, wasn't he?

507
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, he's in the quest with the little Volus from 1.

508
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's right.

509
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And he's in the refugee camp.

510
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
You can talk to him.

511
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Yes, Zaid sucked anyway.

512
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Sorry, this is my opinion.

513
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
$15 for the DLC, which is on the pricier end of Mass Effect.

514
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Absolutely.

515
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is that more than Shadow Broker was?

516
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Was Shadow Broker $10 or was Shadow Broker also $15?

517
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I think it might be $8 or $9 now.

518
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I don't know how much it was back in 2011.

519
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Well, it's going to cost you $15 now, so hopefully there will be enough to substantiate that.

520
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Now, if you look at the multiplayer, even if you don't play multiplayer at all, which,

521
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
if you don't, I do think you should give Mass Effect 3 a shot.

522
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
If you're scared that like, oh, I'm going to suck at multiplayer or whatever,

523
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
or I don't like first person shooters or whatever, I do urge you,

524
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
give Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a shot because the fact that it's all co-op based

525
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
gives it a much different feeling than playing Halo or Modern Warfare Online.

526
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I've never had a bad experience, but I'm on the PC model,

527
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
which is probably the smallest base of all the multiplayer because they're not integrated.

528
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
PS3's got its own thing and XBLA's got its own thing.

529
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Believe it or not, on the 360, I've never had a bad experience.

530
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Go figure. Outside of connection issues, but it's better on the 360 than it is on Origin.

531
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But that's another story. Anyway, the new DLC gives you a great idea

532
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
of probably what you're going to see in this Omega expansion.

533
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I mean, I can't see how they're not going to use the collector stuff.

534
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I mean, if they've done all the work to put them into multiplayer,

535
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I can't see how they're not going to show up somehow.

536
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It'd be very easy to justify in the lore.

537
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, I was going to say, even though Cerberus took Omega,

538
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm sure there's a way to work it.

539
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
And Cerberus... I'm going to get so nerdy in the ending of 2.

540
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Cerberus took the remnants of the collector base at the end of 2,

541
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
even if you blow it up, they still have it.

542
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So they could be controlling the collectors now,

543
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
or the collectors show up and ambush both you and Cerberus.

544
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Either way.

545
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Shane Alinko in chat says they say that it's Cerberus, Rob, for Omega.

546
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
So that means nothing but Cerberus is going to show up?

547
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Yeah, but that could be the plot twist, that the collectors are there too.

548
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But yeah, all through 3, Arya talks about how it's Cerberus.

549
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The Illusive Man kicked her out, and she's pissed.

550
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And then, of course, maybe some of these other weapons

551
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
that have been showing up and so forth, and even maybe the maps,

552
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
because multiplayer maps get used in single-player sometimes.

553
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, a lot of the multiplayer maps are unique to multiplayer, though.

554
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Not originally.

555
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
But you definitely see some multiplayer maps,

556
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
or you see some single, like in the Leviathan DLC,

557
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I could have sworn one of those maps looked a lot like one of the multiplayer maps,

558
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
but it was just kind of different.

559
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
It was a different layout, but kind of like the same assets.

560
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Anyhow, all right, enough Mass Effect talk. Loki's getting bored.

561
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm sorry, I just totally tuned out that whole last segment.

562
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
All right, hater, let's move on.

563
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Maybe you'll be more interested in what Alan has to say.

564
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Remember Darkstalkers?

565
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
2D fighting game, really creative characters,

566
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
really underrated franchise.

567
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Well, Capcom is bringing it back.

568
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Darkstalkers Resurrection was announced at New York Comic-Con this past week,

569
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and it is a HD cleanup of Darkstalkers 2 and 3,

570
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and it's bundled together in one pack, similar to Marvel vs. Capcom Origins.

571
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And also, if you remember the Final Fight Magic Sword combo,

572
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
where you can have it look like an arcade cabinet or you can have it be full screen,

573
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
it's going to be a package like one of those.

574
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And it's going to be, I think, 1200 Microsoft points or 1499.

575
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So, yay, Darkstalkers.

576
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Were you a fan of Darkstalkers?

577
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh, I had a modded Saturn, Sega Saturn, and I imported Darkstalkers 3.

578
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Nice.

579
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Because it used the 4-meg RAM cart for the people that played X-Men vs. Street Fighter on the Saturn,

580
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
if you remember that.

581
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It supported the 4-meg RAM cart. It was arcade perfect. It was gorgeous.

582
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Do you think you'll be picking this up?

583
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I'm going to say no, just because how often do I turn on the 360?

584
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Seriously.

585
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Fair enough. Well, if they ever shut down the Mass Effect 3 servers,

586
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
maybe you'll have a reason to.

587
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah, it's possible.

588
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Mass Effect 4 Xbox exclusive, what are you going to do?

589
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
What are you going to do?

590
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'm just kidding. I'm trolling them.

591
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Didn't they announce a new Darkstalkers game, or was this all the announcement was?

592
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I think they were teasing that something was going to happen,

593
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
and I think this is that something,

594
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
but obviously I think it's trying to either get people talking about Darkstalkers again,

595
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
or to gauge interest for a new Darkstalkers.

596
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I kind of think this is where Capcom's going.

597
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I think there's interest to get this franchise revitalized,

598
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and I'm sure this is a big step in either getting the awareness out there

599
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
before a possible E3 announcement, or gauging it in the first place.

600
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
A lot of people don't realize,

601
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
well, the real people who've been with Capcom since the beginning will know this,

602
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
but the combo system used in X-Men vs. Street Fighter,

603
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and the combo system used in Marvel vs. Capcom,

604
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
the light, light, medium, medium, hard, hard,

605
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
where you do the zigzag across all six buttons,

606
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
that chain combo system, that was done in Darkstalkers.

607
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
That's the engine that they did that crazy combo system in.

608
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Wasn't that also Killer Instinct? You could kind of do that too?

609
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Those were weird, like Link.

610
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Those were very specific things you had to do.

611
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
When you say zigzag combos with the six buttons, that's honestly what I think of.

612
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
I think of Killer Instinct before I think of that, but I get you.

613
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
All right, well, let's travel around the world

614
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
and look at some release dates of some games coming out near you

615
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
a little sooner than Darkstalkers, perhaps.

616
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Let's start with the US, Loki.

617
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
All right, so let's see here.

618
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
This week, we have quite a few things coming out,

619
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,000
starting off with Rocksmith, guitar and bass.

620
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Technically, it's like the first game with the bass expansion,

621
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
but they've got that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC,

622
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
as well as bundled with an electric guitar.

623
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Dance Central 3 coming out this week on Xbox 360.

624
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Mugen Souls on PlayStation 3.

625
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Also, let's see here.

626
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:25,000
We've got 007 Legends on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

627
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What else here?

628
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Doom 3 BFG Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

629
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Noomba Fitness Core on the Wii and Xbox 360.

630
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Jeopardy on PS3 and 360.

631
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Wheel of Fortune also on PS3 and 360.

632
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Silent Hill Book of Memories for the Vita.

633
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Man, that's been delayed forever.

634
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
That's finally coming out.

635
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
That was delayed quite a bit.

636
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah, because I don't think it was very good from what I hear.

637
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Maybe they made it better.

638
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I certainly hope so.

639
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Otherwise, it's going to be kind of a disappointment.

640
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Not that I'm not used to them being a disappointment.

641
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Let's see, what else?

642
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I do know that one week from today,

643
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
because they have to launch it on a Sunday because it's so special,

644
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Skylighter Giants coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS,

645
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and I think that's it.

646
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Also, they're going to have a portal owner's pack

647
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
in case you think about the first game.

648
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So that would be it.

649
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
All right, let's travel to Japan and look out there.

650
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Actually, wait, I want to read a comment from chat real quick.

651
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

652
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
when are they going to do a rock smith for keyboards?

653
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Like, keyboard smith.

654
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
If they do that, I am so there.

655
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Like, I'm not that interested in learning how to play guitar, honestly,

656
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
but I used to play the organ,

657
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
like the double-decker pianos with top and bottom.

658
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I used to play that when I was younger, like way younger, like 5 to 10,

659
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
and I can still kind of hunt and peck my way around a piano or whatever,

660
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
but if they were to do this so I could, like, refine my skills,

661
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I am so there.

662
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
If I could, like, you know, because I really enjoy it in Rock Band 3.

663
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I really do.

664
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Remember the keyboard main that they had for the actual keyboard?

665
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It was on PC?

666
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yeah, I do. Yeah. I didn't own it, but...

667
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Did you ever play Rock Band 3?

668
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Of course I played Rock Band 3. I loved the keyboard mode in Rock Band 3.

669
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, and then there was Keyboard Mania, of course, many years ago in Japan,

670
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
and that was fun, too.

671
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
That was always my favorite of the Moana games,

672
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
even though it was horribly neglected.

673
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Anyhow, let's go to Japan and check out some games coming out over there.

674
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Monster Hunter Frontier Online Forward 5 Premium Package on the Xbox 360 on the 17th.

675
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
That is also, I guess, coming...

676
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I guess there's a bundle with Xbox Live Points you can get, too,

677
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I guess, for some of the transactions in the game.

678
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Well, I think Monster Hunter Online for them is actually a monthly fee.

679
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Oh, okay, so that's probably a points recurring fee.

680
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Dance Central 3 gets a Japanese release on October 18th.

681
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Darksiders 2 gets a Japanese release on October 18th,

682
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
as does FIFA 13 World Class Soccer.

683
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Again, those are all Xbox 360 for the few 360 owners in Japan.

684
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Interesting about Dance Central 3, I'm imagining it's got to be the same song list.

685
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I don't think they localize for the area or whatever,

686
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
so don't get excited if you're a J-Pop fan.

687
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I don't think there's anything to look for there,

688
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
but interesting that they got such a quick turnaround.

689
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
It is very disappointing that they don't have Wild Wild West like they do,

690
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
or just Dance 4.

691
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 and FIFA 13

692
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
also coming there on the PlayStation 3 on the 18th.

693
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Let's see, going to some of the handhelds.

694
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
On the Vita this week, FIFA 13 is there as well,

695
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and The Legend of Heroes Zero no Kisuke Evolution comes out on the PlayStation Vita.

696
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Just saying, if you haven't bought the Vita version of FIFA 13,

697
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
you may want to hold off.

698
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Why is that?

699
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's exactly the same as FIFA 12.

700
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Oh, I thought that was the Wii version.

701
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Both of them.

702
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Oh, no.

703
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Bastards.

704
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Project X Zone on October 19th from Namco Bandai.

705
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That's pretty awesome.

706
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Those are your Japanese release dates.

707
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Alan, would you care to take us to the land of all things Britain?

708
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Sure.

709
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And UK-ish?

710
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:32,000
October 15th has The War Z, or The War Zed, coming out on PC.

711
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
October 17th, we've got Serious Sam 3 BFE on Xbox 360

712
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
and The Unfinished Swan on PlayStation 3.

713
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
19th of October, 007 Legends on 360 and PS3.

714
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Dance Central 3 on the 360.

715
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Doom 3 BFG Edition on the 360, PS3, and PC.

716
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Madagascar 3, the video game, which I'm sure is going to be the best game released this year,

717
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
because movie tie-in games are always phenomenal,

718
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
on 360, PS3, DS, PC, 3DS, and Wii.

719
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Those big cross-platform juggernauts.

720
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
RockSmith on PC.

721
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Skylanders Giants on Wii, iPhone, 360, PS3, and PC.

722
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita.

723
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And that is it.

724
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Just a few more news stories for you guys,

725
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

726
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Dark Soccer isn't here, so we're taking over.

727
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
See what we picked in a minute.

728
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
But first, Loki.

729
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Apparently, SingStar is going to be a free-to-play game pretty soon.

730
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Which kind of makes sense, because when you buy SingStar, you get some songs,

731
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
but it's basically just a platform to buy more songs.

732
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
If you look at Rob's library, that shit ain't free.

733
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Shut up.

734
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Hey, don't be a jealous hater, because I have SingStar Abba, which is awesome,

735
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
SingStar Queen, which is awesome,

736
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
and SingStar 1 and 2 on the PlayStation 3, which are okay.

737
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And how many songs a la carte that you've bought?

738
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Enough.

739
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Enough to have a party.

740
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Enough to entertain my guests when there's a SingStar.

741
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I've been collecting them since I lived at that house with John.

742
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
We don't really have parties here in the tiny apartment,

743
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
but when I lived in the house with John where OLR was in the garage studio,

744
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
we used to have SingStar parties, and we had a good time.

745
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And a lot of those I bought on sale, to be fair.

746
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I bought SingStar Queen at the local flea market for like eight bucks.

747
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
How are you going to say no to that?

748
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And it was new.

749
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
It was brand new, still wrapped.

750
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Apparently you still need the microphone, obviously, to play the game,

751
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
but I guess there is a message now popping up on the SingStar games.

752
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
They're basically saying the complete SingStar experience will be available

753
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
as a free download very soon.

754
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And apparently they're going to offer that as a download,

755
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
and then you buy the song separately, I guess.

756
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Which I think that's kind of cool, because if you think about it,

757
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
they did something similar with the PSP version of Rock Band,

758
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
where they had a demo that you can get, and it came with a couple songs,

759
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and then you just build your own rock band library.

760
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Instead of paying 40 bucks or whatever for the game,

761
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
you can save that money and buy 40 bucks worth of songs that you want to sing.

762
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Maybe you don't like all of ABBA's songs.

763
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Maybe you only like a couple.

764
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
You buy a couple ABBA songs, and you buy some Britney Spears or something.

765
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

766
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Who the fuck is going to be satisfied with only a couple of ABBA songs?

767
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
If only a couple ABBA songs is what it takes to satisfy you,

768
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
get out of here.

769
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Maybe those people want to spend their money on Queen or something like that.

770
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Look, if you're on a limited income, then I understand.

771
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But you need to set up your monthly ABBA plan to get you on your path.

772
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Good idea for Sony?

773
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I think it's a good idea.

774
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Might as well.

775
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
They haven't really done anything with SingStar in a while.

776
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I think it's a good idea, because it's going to get more exposure for people,

777
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
and because the SingStar games don't really sell that well.

778
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I mean, they really don't.

779
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They don't?

780
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
No, they don't.

781
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I bet they do overseas a lot better.

782
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
They probably do overseas, but honestly,

783
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
karaoke games don't do very well.

784
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
But everybody's got a USB microphone,

785
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
especially those wonderful Logitech microphones that they put in everything.

786
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
They work on pretty much all systems.

787
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
So you get one of those in a throwaway game,

788
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
like Truth or Lies or something like that.

789
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I don't know.

790
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And you've got a SingStar mic.

791
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, actually, no, those SingStar mics are different.

792
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But still, I mean, you could find a bundle for SingStar

793
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
for, like, dirt cheap somewhere.

794
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm sure that, like, a GameStop or Walmart or something

795
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
has them in their dump bin.

796
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Just go looking for it.

797
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
All right.

798
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Well, let's move on to one more story about, you know,

799
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
this always pisses people off when there's content on the disk

800
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
that they call DLC, and you have to pay to unlock it,

801
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
which, you know, we started using the term pay-to-unlock content

802
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
instead of DLC for certain things.

803
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Well, when it was discovered that Resident Evil 6

804
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
has some things locked away on the disk,

805
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
everybody was like, oh, here we go again, Capcom.

806
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Pay-to-unlock DLC.

807
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
But apparently Capcom announced that the things that were found on the disk,

808
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
including no hope difficulty level and co-op for Ada Wong's campaign,

809
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:39,000
these will be freebies, and they will be a free title update coming soon.

810
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So no word if they only made it free because they got caught.

811
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Or I actually, you know, all trolling aside,

812
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I can see the value of doing free DLC

813
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
because it extends the life of your game past the first week,

814
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
especially in the very busy holiday season

815
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
where there are so many games competing for your attention.

816
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I can actually see the value of this.

817
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
So, you know, I can't believe I'm about to say this,

818
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
but good on Capcom in this case.

819
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's just so they can release a gold edition of the game later on

820
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
with the actual stuff unlocked already.

821
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
That's what they did before with Resident Evil 5.

822
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Remember they had all that, like, PlayStation Move updates?

823
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Just reprint all of it and put it in the new gold box?

824
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
We'll put it in the gold box and we'll sell it again and people will buy it.

825
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I mean, that's what's going to happen.

826
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Now it is coming out that there will be paid DLC,

827
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
but it will not already be on the disk. It's coming later.

828
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So, all right.

829
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Let's move on to a time when there wasn't even a Resident Evil 1 yet.

830
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I don't think when this game originally came out.

831
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Maybe one was out. I don't know.

832
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
There was.

833
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
There was a 1. All right.

834
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
But, okay, back when the Resident Evil series was good.

835
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
There was no download content.

836
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
That's right. There was no download content.

837
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
When Resident Evil 2 was going to be on the N64. Remember that?

838
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh, yes, I do. I do.

839
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
It's a classic game of the week.

840
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Dark Soccer. She ain't here again.

841
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So we've snatched her pick away from her

842
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and we've picked an awesome game in her place

843
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
that we think you guys should be playing this week.

844
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And we gave it to Alan this week.

845
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So, Alan, what is your classic game of the week?

846
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Well, usually when I do this segment,

847
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I do, like, old Sierra Online PC games or, like, LucasArts.

848
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So I wanted to give consoles love this time.

849
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
And I wanted to do something handheld

850
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,000
because I don't think handheld gets that much love in this segment.

851
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:45,000
So I chose Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages

852
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,000
for the Game Boy Color because they are super awesome.

853
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Legend of Zelda, Seasons, and Ages came out together, obviously,

854
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
because you can play one, you get this huge, massive password code

855
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
that you then plug into the next game and then you continue the story.

856
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And once you beat both of the games,

857
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
so you play one, you get your code, you play the other one,

858
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
then you get to fight Ganon, who's the secret boss,

859
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
and then you get to see Zelda proper and you get the real ending.

860
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
And one of the big deals about this game

861
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:28,000
was the fact that Nintendo did not develop or design it.

862
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
They let a subsidiary of Capcom, called Flagship,

863
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
write and code and design the game and Nintendo simply published it.

864
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And I think that may be one of the first times

865
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Nintendo has ever let a blue chip franchise

866
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
be in the hands of someone else.

867
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Now it's not that rare because Sega has done stuff

868
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
and there was that Metroid game that was done by Team Ninja.

869
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:59,000
This game came out in the US in May of 2001,

870
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
which was the month before the Game Boy Advance console proper came out.

871
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So this is one of the last games for the Game Boy Color

872
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
before that generation was phased out and the Advance took over.

873
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Some of the best Game Boy Color graphics that you'll probably ever see.

874
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And even looking on the YouTube, that looks pretty good.

875
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It's like eight colors, I think, on the Game Boy Color.

876
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Yeah, so if you play one game,

877
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
some of the items that you get are upgradeable in the second game.

878
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
There are a lot of little side quests and little...

879
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Look at these little cartoony cut scenes too for Game Boy Color.

880
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Yeah.

881
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
So if you play both games, depending on which order you play them in,

882
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
you can upgrade certain...

883
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Like the hookshot and bloom ring, certain items you can upgrade

884
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
to a tier that you couldn't normally get

885
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
if you bring all of your equipment and stuff over into the next game.

886
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
In Oracle of Ages, there is a time mechanic

887
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
where you speed up time or slow down time to get past...

888
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
To solve certain puzzles in the dungeons

889
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
or on the overworld to actually get into the dungeon.

890
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
In Oracle of Seasons, you have a rod that will...

891
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
If there's a river, you'll make it winter

892
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
and the water will freeze so you can cross the river.

893
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Stuff like that.

894
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Was this the game that had the advanced dungeons

895
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
or was that one of the other Game Boy games?

896
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That was Link's Awakening DX, wasn't it?

897
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
One of them you could plug into the Game Boy Advance

898
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
and then there would be this special...

899
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Actually, maybe it was the Advance Shop.

900
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I think it was something...

901
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Because you say this one...

902
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Because I remember playing it

903
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
and this was right on that cusp of when

904
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
the Game Boy Advance first came out, right?

905
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Yeah, it was a month before.

906
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So, you know what? I think it was this game.

907
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Because I think I remember playing it on the Advance

908
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
and the Advance had some special little thing in it.

909
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm not sure about that.

910
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I think you're thinking of the re-release of Link's Awakening.

911
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Maybe I am.

912
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Somebody in chat will correct me.

913
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
That's the lovely part of doing a live show.

914
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
One of the awesome things about the Legend of Zelda handheld games

915
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
is that...

916
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Nintendo, Miyamoto has even come out and said this.

917
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
In the handheld Zelda games,

918
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:17,000
they will allow themselves to do things with the franchise

919
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
and with the mechanics and the story that they simply can't do

920
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,000
on the console versions.

921
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Because the console ones are obviously the big deal.

922
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Now with Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword,

923
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
even Wind Waker,

924
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
they still find ways either with the art direction

925
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
or the werewolf mechanic.

926
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
They're always coming up with stuff to keep the series fresh,

927
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
but you're always going to have the three medallions,

928
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
you're always going to have the Master Sword,

929
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
you're always going to fight Ganon.

930
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
There are these staple things that are always in those games.

931
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
In the handheld ones, like Oracle of Seasons and Ages' Minish Cap,

932
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass,

933
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
that's when they really get super creative

934
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
with the world of Hyrule

935
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
and the stuff that you can do.

936
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
They usually introduce a lot of new characters

937
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
that you'll never really see again in the handheld games.

938
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Link's Awakening, with the fish or whatever that's sleeping,

939
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
that whole plot was inspired by Twin Peaks.

940
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Do you know it? Because you're a big Twin Peaks fan, right?

941
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Yes, I do.

942
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Yeah, so that's just an example of how Zelda really shines

943
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
in a lot of unique ways on the handheld systems.

944
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Now, I did some research, and the Advanced Shop was

945
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.

946
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
It was a shop. It was not a dungeon.

947
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I think I called it the Advanced Dungeon at first.

948
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's probably what confused you.

949
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
When these games are played on a Game Boy Advance,

950
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
there is a shop.

951
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
They have two seed rings and a gasha seed.

952
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Depending on the game, it's either the GBA time ring

953
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
or the GBA nature ring, while the other is a random ring.

954
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right.

955
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I remember it's right here in the article.

956
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Since this was so close to the Game Boy Advance release,

957
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
if you played it on the Advance in addition to that shop,

958
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
the graphics were also much improved.

959
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So they had obviously not Game Boy Advance quality graphics,

960
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
but the color palette and the clarity of the pixels,

961
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
they actually was coded onto the Game Boy Color cartridge

962
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
to be read by the Advance.

963
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That's awesome.

964
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,000
So, yeah, if you look this up on YouTube,

965
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
try to find the Advance run-throughs.

966
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
As far as how it played, again, it's Legend of Zelda.

967
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
If you've played Minish Cap, Link to the Past,

968
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
the first Zelda game, you know, overhead,

969
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
big expansive map, you go into dungeons,

970
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
you have to beat the dungeons in a certain order

971
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
because the items that you get in the dungeon,

972
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
the treasure is what you'll need to solve puzzles

973
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,000
in the dungeon after that, and so on and so forth.

974
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
The main antagonists, I believe, are Twinrova.

975
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I think the double witches could be wrong there.

976
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It's been so long since I've played this.

977
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
But, yeah, there are these...

978
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
The oracles are these ladies that you meet

979
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
when you're transported to these new worlds.

980
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
These games don't take place in Hyrule

981
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
like a lot of the handheld games.

982
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
So, yeah, they are in danger, and there's...

983
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Naru is one, and Din, I think, is the other one.

984
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
So you rescue them, and then as you progress through,

985
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
you beat the one game and you play the other one.

986
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And you do figure out finally how Zelda and Ganon

987
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
and the Triforce factor into it.

988
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
They're a lot of fun. If you're a big Zelda fan

989
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
and you haven't played these, you're missing out.

990
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
All right, good pick. Your classic game of the week,

991
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
The Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Ages, and Oracle of Seasons.

992
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Two games for the price of one.

993
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Yes.

994
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
All right, thank you very much, Alan. Good pick.

995
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I think Jamie would be happy.

996
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
All right, well, that's going to do it for Part A of our show,

997
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more show to come

998
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
as we get back, including some rapid-fire news,

999
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
the FUGO Question of the Week, and some interesting rumors

1000
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
about Miyamoto's new direction.

1001
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And an event coming up appropriately named Fuck This Jam.

1002
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
We'll talk about that. It's not our event. It's somebody else's.

1003
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
We'll talk about that a little more when we come back

1004
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,000
after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1005
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1006
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
We are live with the 477th episode of our show

1007
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
here at vognetwork.com, The Voice of Geeks Network.

1008
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And looking at the chatroom during the break there

1009
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
at live.vognetwork.com, looks like Bobby's talking to some of the people

1010
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
in there about his experience with the drill

1011
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
and some of the band stuff that he does.

1012
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I know he does a lot of that stuff professionally.

1013
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Little-known fact, I did marching band in high school, too.

1014
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I played the clarinet and did a lot of those field shows.

1015
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And it had me thinking about that video.

1016
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
And surely you all have seen this by now.

1017
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It was all over Facebook.

1018
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Even people I know that aren't that into video games were posting this.

1019
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Did you guys see that Ohio State marching band show

1020
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
where they were doing the tribute to all the video games?

1021
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Surely you guys saw this.

1022
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Logan, you see this, Allen?

1023
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
No.

1024
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You didn't see it?

1025
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
When they did the Galloping Horse, it blew my fucking mind.

1026
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I know. It was really amazing, some of the stuff they were doing.

1027
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Now, you know, having done field shows in the past before,

1028
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and I'm sure Bobby can attest to this, too,

1029
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm sure we're not the only band nerds

1030
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
that happen to be into video games and all that.

1031
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I'm sure there's plenty more band nerds out there listening to this show.

1032
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But it is a lot of work,

1033
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
because you not only have to memorize songs,

1034
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
but you have to memorize where on the field you're going.

1035
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
It's not the hardest thing in the world.

1036
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I thought it was easier than memorizing lines for a stage play.

1037
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
But it's challenging.

1038
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
And I have even more respect for that video after seeing it.

1039
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
That was an amazing little piece.

1040
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And it also made me super jealous that we didn't get to do that

1041
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
when I was in high school.

1042
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Amazing.

1043
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Jessica Harper from Understation Live is in our chat room

1044
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
at live.vognetwork.com and says,

1045
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I was, however, the drum major my senior year.

1046
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I feel like she's told me that before, and I forgot.

1047
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And that's awesome, because I tried out to be drum major,

1048
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
but I wasn't picked.

1049
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Somebody else was picked.

1050
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I'm a drum major reject.

1051
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
And now look at me. I'm on a podcast about video games on the internets.

1052
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Anyhow.

1053
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Drum major reject.

1054
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
That'll be the title of my first album, Drum Major Reject.

1055
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
All right.

1056
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well, I'm glad Jessica could achieve where I clearly failed miserably.

1057
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
All right.

1058
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I apologize again for my voice, you guys.

1059
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I am kind of struggling through tonight's show.

1060
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I've already had a hot cup of coffee and a throat-coat cup of tea,

1061
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
and it'll fix it for about 30 seconds,

1062
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
and then I go back to,

1063
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
My voice has got to scratch.

1064
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
So I will do my best.

1065
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
This is like the worst possible thing that can happen to a radio guy,

1066
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,000
but I will do my best to try to get through the next couple hours here,

1067
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
or not next couple hours, but next hour or so,

1068
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
of the show for you guys,

1069
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
because we have plenty more gaming news to talk about.

1070
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news, right, Loki?

1071
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
That is correct.

1072
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
So let's talk a little bit about this really cool sale

1073
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
that they've got on Amazon right now.

1074
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It's a bunch of Square Enix games,

1075
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
and I think it's a great deal.

1076
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's 10 bucks,

1077
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
and you basically get Deus Ex, Human Revolution,

1078
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Augmented Edition,

1079
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
plus the Missing Link DLC, Hitman Blood Money,

1080
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Just Cause 2, Just Cause,

1081
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Quantum Conundrum, Supreme Commander 2,

1082
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and The Last Remnant.

1083
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
For $10.

1084
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And the sale is running through October 20th.

1085
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
It expires at

1086
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
11.59 PM Pacific Standard Time,

1087
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
so go get it,

1088
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
because, I mean, that's

1089
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
seriously a great price.

1090
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Yes, this is a sale we were referring to in Part A,

1091
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
and I gotta say, kind of once, actually.

1092
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Yeah, it's called the Absolutely Great

1093
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Square Pack from Amazon.

1094
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And these are all the PC?

1095
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
All PC.

1096
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Yeah, The Last Remnant, which, you know,

1097
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
was their exclusive RPG for the 360,

1098
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
which was a huge pile of shit,

1099
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
if you have a good PC, it plays fine.

1100
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So the technical issues that it had

1101
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
on the 360 are on PC,

1102
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and you should actually play that game, because it's good,

1103
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
and no one would ever know, because it was so awful on the 360.

1104
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So, overlooked,

1105
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Square RPG.

1106
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Agdeft in our chatroom says,

1107
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Amazon won't let me buy it.

1108
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I wonder if that's the Mexico thing.

1109
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Maybe it's a deal that's only good in the US.

1110
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
That kind of sucks for those

1111
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
that are in other countries. I'm sorry.

1112
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I don't know what else to say.

1113
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It sucks.

1114
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Actually, you know what?

1115
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
It may not be available anymore. It says currently unavailable.

1116
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Maybe it sold out.

1117
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Maybe so many people jumped on it.

1118
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And here's the thing, too.

1119
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
The DRM on it was Steam,

1120
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
so you were getting some sort of codes or something.

1121
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
For a lot of games.

1122
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Oh, wait, wait.

1123
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I see it right here. Actually, no, I'm sorry.

1124
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
It says unavailable, but then there is this

1125
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
buy and download thing.

1126
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Let's try clicking that, just out of curiosity.

1127
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Just come on.

1128
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
No, it will not let me.

1129
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
During some of Steam's

1130
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
really insane 99 cent sales,

1131
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
this happened with GTA 4

1132
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
and Ballad of Gay Tony.

1133
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
They had a note.

1134
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
We don't have codes.

1135
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
We ran out of all our codes,

1136
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
so we have to contact Rockstar Games

1137
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
for 20,000 more codes.

1138
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
That could be the issue that's happening here.

1139
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Well, they may have had limited copies,

1140
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
and then once they hit all the blocks, then...

1141
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Well, that sucks.

1142
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
AlphaCananagram in chat is saying

1143
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
don't know if Loki said, but

1144
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
feel free to use the code

1145
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
S-Q-R-L-U-V-I-O

1146
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
to take $2 off any digital video games

1147
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
purchase. Code will expire

1148
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
when this product becomes available for purchase again.

1149
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I wonder if that means Amazon

1150
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
didn't intend for this to happen

1151
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
or something weird is going on.

1152
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I don't have that code either.

1153
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Very strange.

1154
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
These bastards.

1155
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Alright.

1156
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I bet you're mad for waiting now.

1157
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Check tomorrow.

1158
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Oh no, I do see that.

1159
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
It says currently out of keys.

1160
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Back in stock soon. $2 promo.

1161
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
There it is.

1162
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Just give it some time

1163
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
and keep checking back, I guess.

1164
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Great deal.

1165
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Either way.

1166
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Either way.

1167
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Alright. And then, of course,

1168
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
we have to talk a little bit about

1169
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
some DLC and Sleeping Dogs.

1170
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
They're going to have quite a bit of

1171
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
DLC soon. Starting next week,

1172
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
they're getting some

1173
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
street racing DLC. It's going to add

1174
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
some new street races

1175
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
in the game, I guess, for $4.

1176
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
That's what's going to run you.

1177
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
It's going to have three new races across

1178
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
land and sea. And also,

1179
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I guess, there's some new street

1180
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
racer DLC that they're

1181
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I guess they're adding a new motorcycle

1182
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
as well.

1183
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And a new outfit

1184
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
that boosts, I guess,

1185
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
defense against gunfire and accidents.

1186
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Then there's also going to be

1187
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
some DLC on the

1188
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
30th that's

1189
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I guess it's sort of

1190
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
similar to like, they're kind of

1191
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
comparing it to Undead Nightmare for

1192
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I don't know if there's zombies in it or not, but

1193
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
it's supposed to kind of tie in

1194
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
with Hong Kong Cinema.

1195
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I guess the beginning, it's Nightmare

1196
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
in Northport.

1197
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And it'll be some

1198
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
horror-themed thing that says

1199
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
with the DLC we can

1200
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
explore other aspects of Hong

1201
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Kong Cinema.

1202
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
So, no idea what exactly

1203
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
that is or how much it's going to cost,

1204
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
but that's going to actually be story DLC

1205
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
that's going to be coming pretty soon.

1206
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And last but not least,

1207
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
DLC for Borderlands,

1208
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
which by the way, if you haven't heard

1209
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
yet, that free DLC

1210
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
that if you bought the, or pre-ordered

1211
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
the game and you got the premier club or whatever,

1212
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
they actually released the

1213
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
extra character class early.

1214
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So that came out last week, so that's

1215
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
pretty awesome.

1216
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Another game I really need to go back and play some more.

1217
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But first piece of DLC

1218
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
coming on the 16th,

1219
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
so this Tuesday, it's Captain Scarlet

1220
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
and Her Pirate's Booty.

1221
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
And that's coming for

1222
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
10 bucks,

1223
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
or if you want, you can buy a season pass

1224
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
for 30 bucks and you get four pieces

1225
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
of DLC, so, you know, 25%

1226
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
off. And really,

1227
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I mean, if you played the Borderlands 1

1228
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and played all the DLC in it,

1229
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
you know it's going to be good. So,

1230
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I'm sure that

1231
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
the DLC will be pretty awesome. I'm still waiting

1232
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
to hear on

1233
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
how it goes and maybe I'll have to

1234
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
plunk down the 30 bucks for a season pass.

1235
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Alright.

1236
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Well, going into

1237
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
news on a game that I really should

1238
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
check out at some point because I did love

1239
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
the old series and I hear it is kind of

1240
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
a, you know, newer version of that.

1241
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I just haven't had the time this week to

1242
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
pick it up, but it is XCOM

1243
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Enemy Unknown. The revival

1244
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
of XCOM. Well, there's a pretty nifty

1245
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Easter egg in the game that allows you to bring

1246
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
in super soldiers. You can

1247
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
put in certain names and they

1248
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
activate XCOM Heroes.

1249
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I don't know, for some reason it makes me think of

1250
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
NBA Jam when you could put

1251
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
in certain combinations that would unlock

1252
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Bill Clinton and Scorpion

1253
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
and shit. That was awesome.

1254
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
So, I don't know. But here's the type

1255
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
of people you can unlock here.

1256
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Sid Meier.

1257
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Ken Levine. I think

1258
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
that's awesome that they put Sid Meier in there.

1259
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Joe Kelly and Otto

1260
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Zander are apparently all super soldiers

1261
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
so far.

1262
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Apparently the one little trick to it

1263
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
is that once you summon the heroes,

1264
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
the achievements are turned off.

1265
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
So if you want to go for achievements

1266
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
don't use this little cheat.

1267
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
But maybe once you've beat the game

1268
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
and got the achievements you want, go back

1269
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
and play as Sid Meier. For the lolz!

1270
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Moving on

1271
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
to a Street Fighter movie

1272
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
that apparently is not being made

1273
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
in Japan.

1274
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
This is a Brazilian

1275
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
artist. That's pretty cool. Victor Hugo.

1276
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
He's a real big fan of

1277
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Street Fighter and he wants to do

1278
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
this movie that he calls somewhere

1279
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
between next gen fighting game and Hollywood

1280
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
animated movie.

1281
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
He's teamed up with an animator friend to make

1282
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Street Fighter 3.

1283
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
It's a fan flick

1284
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
and it looks really, really

1285
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
nice. Especially in these little

1286
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
posters. It looks even better

1287
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
than like

1288
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Frankenweenie or one of those movies that's

1289
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
in theaters. It's a really neat art style.

1290
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Kind of impressive that it's

1291
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
only these two guys.

1292
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Even more impressive that Capcom hasn't

1293
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
shut it down yet but maybe the fact that they are

1294
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
in Brazil makes it complicated.

1295
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Good luck to them.

1296
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I really would not have

1297
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
brought this up because I hate giving this

1298
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
attention but it is a slow news week

1299
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
so I will quickly say

1300
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
PETA put out their little spoofs this

1301
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
week of Pokemon Black 2

1302
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
and White 2. It was a little spoof

1303
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
game that they put out. Here's their statement.

1304
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Enjoy this

1305
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
from PETA.

1306
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Much like animals in the real world

1307
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Pokemon are treated as unfeeling objects

1308
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
and used for things as human entertainment

1309
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
and as subjects in experiments.

1310
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
The way the Pokemon are stuffed

1311
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
into Pokeballs is similar to how

1312
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
circuses chain elephants inside railroad cars

1313
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
and let them out only to perform

1314
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
confusing and awful painful tricks that

1315
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
were taught using sharp steel tipped

1316
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
bull hooks and electric shock prods.

1317
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
If PETA existed in Unova

1318
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
our motto would be

1319
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Pokemon are not ours to use or abuse.

1320
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
They exist for their own reasons.

1321
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
We believe that this is the message that should be

1322
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
sent to children.

1323
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Now Pika Pii!

1324
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I just want to remind

1325
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
you guys PETA is clearly trolling

1326
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
with this. Look at that statement.

1327
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Over half of the

1328
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
statement had nothing to do with the

1329
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
game they were putting out. They used

1330
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
half that statement to talk about the whole

1331
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
circus and the elephants and all that

1332
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
stuff. It is all about

1333
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
attention. I mean clearly

1334
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
they play Pokemon.

1335
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
They understand Pokemon because they know

1336
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
about like the Pokemon world.

1337
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
They said if PETA existed in Unova

1338
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
they didn't say if PETA existed

1339
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
in the Pokemon universe or if PETA

1340
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
ruled Nintendo. These people

1341
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
know what the fuck they're doing by getting

1342
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
attention. Congratulations.

1343
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
You picked the right

1344
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
week to do it at least if nothing else.

1345
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Alan. I

1346
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
played PETA's Cooking Mama game

1347
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
from Thanksgiving and

1348
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
whoever they contract to do their

1349
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Shockwave games, some of them are actually

1350
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
kind of good. That almost

1351
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
is the reason why these things are worth

1352
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
covering because as much as they are

1353
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
trolly and it's like

1354
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
you just roll your eyes at PETA

1355
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
they are really

1356
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
high quality trolls.

1357
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Yeah, because the Cooking Mama

1358
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
one was how to make a Tofurky

1359
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
in the vegan Thanksgiving.

1360
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
You click and drag the food ingredients. I'm like

1361
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
this is a pretty well done little Shockwave

1362
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
game.

1363
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Do you

1364
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
remember playing on the Genesis ToeJam & Earl?

1365
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Because I do.

1366
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
The sequel ToeJam & Earl and Panic

1367
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
on Funkotron are going to hit

1368
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
the PSN and

1369
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
XBLA online stores on November

1370
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
6th and 7th respectively.

1371
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I never played this because

1372
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
at the time I was at the age where

1373
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
I was really kind of butthurt.

1374
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
It's basically

1375
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
a 2D side scrolling platformer

1376
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
and the original ToeJam & Earl

1377
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
was like an overhead sort of adventure

1378
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
game.

1379
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So yeah, if you're a fan of ToeJam & Earl

1380
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
and want some vintage Genesis

1381
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
nostalgia, pick that up November 6th

1382
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and 7th.

1383
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
God of War Ascension

1384
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
which is the next God of War game because you know

1385
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
they're not going to let that franchise die off.

1386
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
The demo is going to be in the Total

1387
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Recall remake.

1388
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
The one with Colin, whatever his name is.

1389
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
That comes out on

1390
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
December 18th.

1391
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
So get the Total Recall

1392
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Blu-ray, play God of War Ascension

1393
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
and that is going to be the only way to get

1394
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
that demo until four days before

1395
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
the game comes out. I think like March

1396
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
8th is when they're

1397
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
putting the demo on PSN and then the game comes out

1398
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
on March 12th of next year.

1399
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
And the graphics for it, just looking at these screenshots

1400
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
look really like

1401
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
disgustingly awesome.

1402
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Very God of War-ish.

1403
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Finally

1404
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
the game Injustice

1405
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Gods Among Us which I will admit I don't really know

1406
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
much about. It's being put

1407
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
out by NetherRealm. They are

1408
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
has a DC Comics character

1409
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
in it. It's going to be Green Arrow.

1410
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Who some people might remember like you know the show

1411
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Supernatural which finally ended after like

1412
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
11 seasons that had Green Arrow in it.

1413
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
It's the Green Arrow I think is

1414
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
best known. Wait, Supernatural's not done.

1415
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Still on the air, isn't it? Oh, I meant Smallville.

1416
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
I'm sorry, Smallville Superman.

1417
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And now there's an Arrow series

1418
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
on CW that like just either it

1419
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
just started last week or it's starting this week.

1420
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Oh, is it a spin-off of the same actor? Yeah, I think

1421
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
they're trying to make Smallville Lightning Strike twice.

1422
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Yeah.

1423
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
So yeah, Green Arrow is going to be

1424
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
a character in Injustice Gods Among Us.

1425
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
There you go.

1426
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Yeah, and it's the

1427
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Justice League outfit I believe from

1428
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
the Cartoon Network show. Shane

1429
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
in chat says, different actor sadly.

1430
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Oh, well that's just

1431
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
unfortunate.

1432
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat, I want to go back

1433
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
to the PETA thing for a minute. Remember, they're delayed

1434
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
so sometimes it takes time for them to comment on things.

1435
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder what

1436
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
PETA thinks of Tokyo Jungle.

1437
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Wouldn't they hate the fact that you play

1438
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
as animals eating other animals?

1439
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Again, this is

1440
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
proof that they're trolling because

1441
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
you know obviously Tokyo Jungle

1442
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
is the game to take issue with but they know

1443
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
that Tokyo Jungle is a niche thing.

1444
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
No one curr about Tokyo Jungle.

1445
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
But what's a game that everybody talks about?

1446
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Pokemon. Anyway, I'm giving

1447
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
this story far too much attention. I just wanted to

1448
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
address that comment because it was worth

1449
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
commenting on. I don't think they really have a problem with

1450
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
people or with animals eating other

1451
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
animals because that just happens in the wild but

1452
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
as long as it's not people eating

1453
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
other animals, that's really the issue

1454
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
there. So by that logic,

1455
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
would they be okay with

1456
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
people eating other people?

1457
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Yes.

1458
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Because they're only for the

1459
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
ethical treatment of animals. Nothing about

1460
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
people. Oh, okay.

1461
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Just wanted to make sure that was clear.

1462
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Unfortunately,

1463
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
doesn't exist. Well, you know, we need a people

1464
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
for the ethical treatment of people.

1465
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
That's what we need. That's the foundation we really

1466
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
well, I sound like such an asshole

1467
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
because it sounds like I'm saying fuck animals

1468
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
and that's not really what I'm saying.

1469
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
But I think we should

1470
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
have a, you know,

1471
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
what about how we treat each other? Isn't

1472
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
that important as well?

1473
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Anyhow.

1474
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Again, giving it far too much credit.

1475
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
You know what deserves more credit on our show?

1476
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Our Facebook and Google

1477
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Plus fan communities.

1478
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's the Fugal

1479
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Question of the Week. Take Facebook and Google

1480
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
and put it together and you get Fugal.

1481
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And the Question of the

1482
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Week this week.

1483
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Kind of a little

1484
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
play on the fact that I've been on vacation

1485
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
for a little bit.

1486
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Everybody's done it at some point in their life or another.

1487
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
What is the worst thing you've

1488
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
missed in real life so you

1489
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
can stay at home and play a video game?

1490
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Did work get in the way of a Final Fantasy

1491
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
launch? Did you stay at home

1492
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
to raid on World of Warcraft instead

1493
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
of going to your friend's birthday party?

1494
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Excuse me. Pick up.

1495
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Bad time.

1496
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Worst nightmare for a radio person.

1497
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Did you stay home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of

1498
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
going to your friend's birthday party?

1499
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Let's go to some of the answers on Google.

1500
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Starting with actdeft. I don't recall

1501
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
missing anything serious for a video game.

1502
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I have come close though. Like

1503
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
almost missing class to get a Dreamcast

1504
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
on Black Friday. Remember I'm from

1505
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Mexico and we don't have Thanksgiving here.

1506
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I think the most serious one was when I

1507
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
offered to help in a DDR tournament the same

1508
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
day I had agreed to help some friends with

1509
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
a political party's elections.

1510
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
But forgot they were the same day.

1511
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Since I'd agreed to the former first, my friends

1512
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
didn't mind and let me go to the tourney though.

1513
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
So no harm done.

1514
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Sean F. replied on Google Plus.

1515
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Yes, there are people on Google Plus.

1516
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I have to say that every week.

1517
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And said I wish I had

1518
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
a terrible secret to reveal. But I think

1519
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
the worst I ever did was I took the day off

1520
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
in 2005 when I got a PSP

1521
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
at midnight release. Wipe out

1522
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
pure and luminous. Good times.

1523
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Indeed

1524
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
good times. Let's

1525
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
go to Facebook and get some answers

1526
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
to the question there in our Facebook community.

1527
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Starting off with

1528
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Where'd the post go? Here it is.

1529
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Critical Myth says

1530
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
I've been far more likely to miss things like

1531
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
company Christmas parties to see

1532
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Lord of the Rings premieres.

1533
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
But a friend of mine skipped his own

1534
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
performance review to stand

1535
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
in line for the 360.

1536
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
He still got promoted.

1537
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Skipped his performance

1538
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
review at work to get a 360.

1539
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That's a pretty good one. He must have known

1540
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
he was going to get a good review and could get away with murder

1541
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
with his boss.

1542
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Degenerated Johnny says

1543
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I was leading my first raid in

1544
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Molten Core during Vanilla WoW.

1545
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Unfortunately the raid was during the time

1546
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I was supposed to pick my mother up from

1547
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
the airport. She was coming

1548
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
back from a trip to her homeland of

1549
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Scotland. This resulted with her

1550
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
being stuck at the airport for two

1551
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
hours. As punishment

1552
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I had to act the role of being her

1553
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
personal chauffeur for an entire

1554
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
month. It wasn't all bad. It allowed

1555
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
us to have some good times with each other.

1556
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
This proves that sometimes gaming

1557
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
experiences can help push families

1558
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
closer together.

1559
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Even if it was through force, right?

1560
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Haseo Sumeru

1561
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Excuse me, sorry

1562
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
guys, the voice is going. Haseo Sumeru

1563
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
says it's funny that you

1564
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
mentioned the Final Fantasy launch thing because way

1565
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
back when I first started playing Final Fantasy

1566
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
X, I faked getting sick

1567
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
so I could stay home from school.

1568
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I went all out, had a heater

1569
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
in my room, aimed at my face to fake

1570
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
the fever and water bottle with ice water

1571
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
for cold sweat. And it was worth

1572
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
it because I managed to make my way through the

1573
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Zanarkand ruins all the way up to the final

1574
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
fight, I think.

1575
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Dark Tetsuya says I actually skipped school

1576
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
the day I got the original PlayStation.

1577
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Ironically ran into my high school

1578
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
tutor at the time who didn't seem to mind.

1579
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Yes, I did graduate.

1580
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
And lastly, Chiggers on Facebook

1581
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
says, never happened.

1582
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
In real life is always

1583
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
more important than a game. The game will

1584
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
always be there, but real life

1585
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
experience only happens once.

1586
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Oh, you.

1587
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
What a party pooper answer.

1588
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
I'm just kidding.

1589
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
That's something we probably should remember.

1590
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Anybody in here with a story to

1591
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
share? What's the worst thing you skipped out on in real

1592
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
life to play a video game? Allen?

1593
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Um...

1594
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
I did some

1595
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
all-nighters when I was in high school

1596
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
where I just didn't go to bed. I just

1597
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
played a game and then when it was time to go to school, I went to school

1598
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
because when you're 16, 17, you can do

1599
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
that shit. Your body's like, fine, I'll be up

1600
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
for, you know, 36

1601
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
hours until eventually you can crash.

1602
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
But as far as missing,

1603
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I mean, I

1604
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
when the PS2 came out,

1605
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I got up, I went to bed at like

1606
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
eight in the evening, got

1607
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
up at one or two in the morning,

1608
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
walked, I think, two or three

1609
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
miles to Target, got in line

1610
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
at Target at like 4 AM.

1611
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
There was

1612
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
already a line. I got PS2

1613
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I think 38 out of 43

1614
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
so my timing couldn't have been any more

1615
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
flawless from wanting

1616
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
to actually avoid camping the

1617
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
entire night out. And then I went

1618
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
into work. Once I actually

1619
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
bought the thing, I think I was in the office by, I want

1620
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
to say 10 or 11 in the morning, but I already cleared it with

1621
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
my boss the night before, so...

1622
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I've never been

1623
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I've never done anything that scandalous.

1624
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I've never, I don't really think I've

1625
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
taken a, have I taken a day off work

1626
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
to play a game?

1627
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I don't, I, if I did, I honestly do

1628
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
not remember. I took a day

1629
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
off work to play World of Warcraft.

1630
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Yeah, because Pandaria, that used to be, yeah. But

1631
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
to be fair, I ended up having a Disneyland

1632
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
trip and I would have taken the day off anyway.

1633
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
True. So,

1634
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
but the, I guess my

1635
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
real answer would be that I cut

1636
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
a lot of class in

1637
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
college to play Final Fantasy 7.

1638
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It was real

1639
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
good and I was really into it, okay? I was more

1640
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
into it than some of my classes I had at the time.

1641
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
You weren't really into college that much anyway.

1642
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I really wasn't, so I, I skipped

1643
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
a lot. I probably cut class

1644
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
to stay home and play Puzzle Fighter 2

1645
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
with friends, so, or

1646
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
excuse me, Super Puzzle Fighter 2

1647
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Turbo or whatever it was called. I probably

1648
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
cut class to stay home and play that with friends and it

1649
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
was worth it, I don't care. Low-key.

1650
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Um, I

1651
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
skipped work, well I took time off

1652
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
for, um,

1653
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Grand Theft Auto, well, recently

1654
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
it was, well actually it wasn't that recent, but

1655
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Grand Theft Auto 4, to try to

1656
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
get 100% on everything so I could get the keys

1657
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
to the city, which I technically

1658
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
did within the time frame that they had

1659
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
in the whole contest thing, but

1660
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
they only had a limited amount of keys and it wasn't

1661
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
registering the information correctly. There was a

1662
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
huge delay, so, I unfortunately

1663
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
didn't get the keys to the city, but

1664
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
um,

1665
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
got the achievement for 100% though.

1666
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I took time off work when Final Fantasy

1667
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
11 came out. I remember

1668
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
that, I was so jazzed for that game,

1669
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I totally took the day off when that came out too.

1670
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
That was years ago.

1671
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I didn't skip work, I just took the day off.

1672
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
So I guess it's not as

1673
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
bad if you planned it in advance, right?

1674
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I'd probably take the day off work for Grand Theft Auto 5.

1675
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
In the future.

1676
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
In the future, planning for 2013.

1677
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Alright, we have some more news stories

1678
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
for you guys, and then we'll get your

1679
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Skype calls here in a little bit.

1680
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Alright, so there's this

1681
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
new patent from Sony for

1682
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
a controller.

1683
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Right now, at least in the diagram, it shows

1684
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
a Playstation Move controller, but apparently

1685
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
it's a controller that allows

1686
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
the user to feel

1687
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
temperature change. So,

1688
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
for example, the controller could get

1689
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
hotter, like if your

1690
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
gun overheats, or you get hit by

1691
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
a fireball, or you're in an area where there's

1692
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
fire, or something like that. Or,

1693
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
if you're in a

1694
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
icy area or something.

1695
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It's kind of like a temperature

1696
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
feedback, as well as how they have

1697
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
the force feedback and stuff.

1698
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So, neat!

1699
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I don't know if it's necessarily something that

1700
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
they're going to be

1701
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
implementing into a Move controller or something

1702
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
like that soon, but

1703
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
it's kind of cool to have this technology

1704
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
around for whenever you may

1705
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
use it in the future,

1706
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
for some new controller or something.

1707
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I don't know if it'd be a big deal,

1708
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
like, you know, a controller got cold

1709
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and went into an icy area. It'd be kind of,

1710
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
haha, that's neat! I'd like to

1711
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
leave it cold all the time, you know.

1712
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Sometimes your hands get sweaty.

1713
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Maybe it should detect whether your hands are sweaty, and then

1714
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
cool off. There's a third-party

1715
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
company idea right there.

1716
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
If Playstation

1717
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
had indie games,

1718
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
somebody would release an indie game that's called

1719
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Hand Warmer.

1720
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And then the

1721
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
sequel, Hand Freezer.

1722
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
You know who needs this technology?

1723
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Microsoft for the Xbox 360.

1724
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Why?

1725
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
When it detects it's getting hot, it gets colder.

1726
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
So the system doesn't crash.

1727
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Oh, okay.

1728
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I see what you did there. That's good.

1729
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
It's just water-cool everything. I don't know.

1730
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Well, it wouldn't be hard for the Playstation controller

1731
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
to get hot. They could just put in there whatever

1732
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
they put in iPhones,

1733
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
because the iPhones get really hot if you're, like,

1734
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
using it too much.

1735
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
When it's really straining

1736
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
for a signal, I notice it gets really hot.

1737
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
That's how they could do it.

1738
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Maybe they could

1739
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
implement this into the iPhone.

1740
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
You know, when you piss off Siri

1741
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
by asking a bunch of stupid questions, it'll just

1742
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
melt down into your hand.

1743
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
You'll just...

1744
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I'm gonna burn your hand now!

1745
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Wrong answer.

1746
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Punishing games.

1747
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Kinda... dumb.

1748
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
This would be something that you'd add to, like,

1749
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
haptics later on, but let's get the haptics

1750
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
thing out of the way first, you know.

1751
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I think more people would be interested in

1752
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
touching things rather than, ooh, it's cold now.

1753
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
First off, actually, challenge number one.

1754
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Getting people to buy the move.

1755
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
That's challenge number one.

1756
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Challenge two, implementing, you know, temperature

1757
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
change in there, and having people

1758
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
be interested. And seriously, how is temperature

1759
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
change gonna come in handy in, like,

1760
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Just Dance 4, or, like,

1761
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I don't know, Archery

1762
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
in Sports Champions, or...

1763
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Maybe this is why the last Guardian got

1764
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
delayed. Maybe he's guarding temperature.

1765
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I don't know.

1766
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Maybe it's because it's gonna be a launch

1767
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
in another system or something.

1768
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Alright. Or maybe it's nothing.

1769
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Maybe it's just somebody

1770
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
had the idea and it was like, you know what,

1771
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
let's patent it just in case Nintendo's thinking of something.

1772
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Well, this is an interesting

1773
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
little rumor that's going around.

1774
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Take it with a grain of salt, because it's

1775
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
spawned from a NeoGaf post, but

1776
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
you never know. Sometimes where there's smoke,

1777
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
there's fire. Sometimes.

1778
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Rumor is,

1779
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Shigeru Miyamoto is expected

1780
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
to leave Nintendo's EAD division

1781
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
by December. How many times has his

1782
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
rumor been around? I mean, seriously, there was

1783
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
another rumor that he, this was like a couple

1784
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
months ago, that it was the same

1785
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
damn thing. Apparently, Miyamoto is not

1786
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
happy, because the EAD

1787
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
general manager overshadows the

1788
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
content that's created by new producers

1789
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
and directors at Nintendo's largest gaming division.

1790
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
New Super Mario

1791
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Bros. producer Takashi

1792
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Tezuka is rumored to take his place.

1793
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Other changes,

1794
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
boy, where

1795
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I said there's smoke, there's fire.

1796
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Where there's wank, there's a lot of wank.

1797
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
A major

1798
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
shift in Kyoto development sources

1799
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
involving three research and development

1800
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
buildings.

1801
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
New groups and new producers being

1802
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
announced for EAD Kyoto and

1803
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
SPD Kyoto. A Tokyo

1804
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
expansion of EAD and

1805
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Mashihiro Sakurai possibly

1806
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
joining EAD Tokyo.

1807
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
New division led by

1808
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Miyamoto with younger staff

1809
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
focused on smaller scale games.

1810
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Miyamoto's

1811
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
departure inspiring new IPs

1812
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
for the EAD Kyoto division.

1813
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
And Cliffy B

1814
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
going to EAD Tokyo.

1815
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I added the last one myself.

1816
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I added that one myself.

1817
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Come on.

1818
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
I had to throw my own wank on there too.

1819
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Why not? Everybody else is.

1820
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Maybe that's a list list.

1821
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Nintendo

1822
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
wank. Best Nintendo wank.

1823
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Come on. Let's make up a Nintendo rumor.

1824
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Come on. Come on, Alan. Make up a Nintendo rumor.

1825
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Total legit source. Come on.

1826
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Wii U

1827
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
will use points

1828
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
like XBLA

1829
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
and have DRM.

1830
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yes, it probably will because

1831
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
there's this thing called Wii points that already

1832
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
exist. I know you've never played a Wii.

1833
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Come on, Loki.

1834
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Add your own Nintendo wank. It's fun.

1835
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Nintendo wank. Let's see.

1836
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
I

1837
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
don't know. This is tough.

1838
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
It's tough to come up with something stupid.

1839
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
People pull this shit out of their ass all day

1840
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
long. I know, but I have to be

1841
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
selective when I pull out of my ass to make it

1842
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
sound a little bit more legitimate than the other people

1843
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
that pull stuff out of their asses.

1844
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
That's the thing. That's why I was giving it some thought there.

1845
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
So, Loki, the man who works

1846
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
for the distributor, what is Nintendo going to do

1847
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
next? What are you posting to me after tomorrow?

1848
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
They're going to fake another shortage on the goddamn Wii U

1849
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
system to create an artificial demand.

1850
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
That's not a rumor.

1851
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Oh, no.

1852
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Did you hear what? No, this actually didn't make our show

1853
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
but did you hear what their fucking excuse was? There was a

1854
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
fire in a production plant, I guess, that lowered

1855
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
their amount of units that they're going to put out by

1856
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
a million or something. Isn't that the same excuse they used

1857
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
for the gasoline prices going up?

1858
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Yeah, there was a fire in a production plant.

1859
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Goddamn, Wii U's were there. Why did we store them

1860
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
next to the oil?

1861
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
AlphaCananagram in chat wants

1862
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
to remind me they did get rid of the points

1863
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
because the Nintendo 3DS eShop

1864
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
does use regular money for currency.

1865
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Yeah, they got rid of those cards.

1866
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Whatever. You know what they're going to do?

1867
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
I have a Nintendo rumor. Okay, yes, thank you.

1868
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Their online integration is going to be really mediocre.

1869
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
These aren't rumors!

1870
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
3DS Micro.

1871
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
It's small enough to fit in your pocket, man.

1872
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And to take inspiration from Apple,

1873
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
they're going to make their next 3DS

1874
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
super wide so they can have yet

1875
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
another attachment for the stupid

1876
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Have you seen the... was it the LL and the XL?

1877
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Have you seen the...

1878
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I was like, okay, okay, we made it bigger.

1879
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
We could have put a thumb pad here, but no.

1880
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
We're going to have an even larger thing that's going to attach to it

1881
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
and make it even wider than it was.

1882
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Is that really happening?

1883
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Yes, it's really happening.

1884
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Is it out yet?

1885
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I think it's coming out in Japan if it's not out already.

1886
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
It's very soon. They have pictures of it.

1887
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
And it's not Photoshop. It's like, this is an official thing

1888
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
because, you know, you want the larger...

1889
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I mean, seriously, it's just...

1890
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Let me just add another, like,

1891
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
half of a laptop right here

1892
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
and I'll put just a giant, like, analog...

1893
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I should do that. You know, make a project.

1894
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I have this analog stick that's just, like, the size of my hand.

1895
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
It'll look like that Tetris game

1896
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
at Golf Land with the gigantic

1897
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
joystick that you use to move the pieces.

1898
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Have you seen that? The Sega Tetris?

1899
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I'm surprised no one's actually sold one of those.

1900
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
It's like a, you know, home thing.

1901
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Could be fun.

1902
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It could be fun.

1903
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Alright.

1904
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Let's move on. Alan, do you have some legitimate news for us?

1905
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Kickstarter.

1906
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Everyone's favorite controversial crowdsource.

1907
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I said legitimate.

1908
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It's going

1909
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
live in the UK on

1910
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Halloween. It's gonna be a part of the same

1911
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
site. There is not going to be some,

1912
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
you know, Kickstarter-UK.com.

1913
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
It's just Kickstarter.

1914
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
But if you're within the UK, you can now,

1915
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
you know, put up your project.

1916
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Obviously, the

1917
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
currency available is going to be

1918
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
listed in pounds. Doesn't say anything

1919
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
about euros here.

1920
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Yeah, you can set your goal and your stretch goals

1921
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
and I imagine if you're in the US and you

1922
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
want, you see something awesome over in the UK,

1923
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
you can bid on it like you can

1924
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
in any other Kickstarter. But, yeah, they got the

1925
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
payment and the

1926
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
those sketchy, you know, legal financial

1927
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
stuff sorted out. So, yay, UK, you're

1928
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
getting Kickstarter. I'm sure they're all very excited.

1929
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
That's all. That's all I got.

1930
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
There you go.

1931
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I guess they got their legal

1932
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
stuff worked out, but there was already, you

1933
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
know, the other. So, whatever.

1934
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Have fun getting addicted to Kickstarter

1935
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
or hating on it or whatever

1936
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
side of the fence you choose to be on.

1937
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
As diverse as we are on this show.

1938
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Have fun with that, UK.

1939
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
It's a borderland, so a lot of copies.

1940
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
How many copies? Oh, shit.

1941
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
1.4 million copies. That's a lot of copies.

1942
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
That's a success. 60 bucks

1943
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
a pop. That's a lot of money.

1944
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Exactly. And, of course, you know, also

1945
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
that, um, I believe it sold

1946
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I can't remember what percent more than

1947
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
234% more than the first game.

1948
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
So, at launch,

1949
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
that's pretty awesome. Not

1950
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
so awesome, NBA Baller

1951
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Beats, which sold 3,000 copies.

1952
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Total. Wait a minute. You mean

1953
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
there wasn't a market for basketball

1954
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
and music fusion games?

1955
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Basketball, yeah, exactly.

1956
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Basketball, you know, it's a Kinect

1957
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
game that requires you to have a floor

1958
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
that's, you know, that you're not in an apartment

1959
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
and that the floor is, like, hardwood

1960
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
or something. Here's the ironic

1961
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
twist. Now it's a collector's item

1962
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
when it sells that few copies.

1963
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
No, it's not.

1964
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
That's like saying

1965
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
that the eye of judgment is a collector's item.

1966
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It's not. It kinda is, in a way.

1967
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
The, uh, Borderlands, that

1968
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
is only hard copies

1969
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
of the game. I think this is saying, uh,

1970
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
digital distribution is not in that figure at

1971
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
all, so that's even more awesome for them.

1972
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Yeah, that's awesome. Unfortunately, the digital version

1973
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
of NBA Baller Beats doesn't exist, so

1974
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I can't use that to inflate

1975
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
the numbers there. Bobby Lackwolf in our chat room

1976
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
at live.vognetwork.com wants to

1977
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
remind us NBA Baller Beats had 50,000

1978
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Twitter followers. Remember that whole thing?

1979
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
So how did they only sell 3,000

1980
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
copies of the game with 50,000 Twitter

1981
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
followers? It was... Do you mean to tell me

1982
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
they had fake Twitter followers? It wasn't

1983
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
50,000. It was 500,000

1984
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Twitter followers.

1985
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Yeah, it was 500,000 because I think they

1986
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
have 100,000 for, like, Call of Duty

1987
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Black Ops 2 or something

1988
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
like that. Yes, they bought their

1989
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Twitter followers. Wait, wait,

1990
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
wait, wait, wait.

1991
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
You mean to tell me

1992
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
that they bought

1993
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
all those Twitter followers?

1994
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Yes, they did. There was an article

1995
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
on the Penny Arcade... 449,631

1996
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
followers

1997
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
and they sold 3,000 copies of the game?

1998
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Yeah, because all those guys

1999
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
are really legit.

2000
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And you know what's great is even

2001
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
after all that they're like, we didn't

2002
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
buy those followers.

2003
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
You know, people are really excited about

2004
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
this game, okay? Really?

2005
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
You know what game sold

2006
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
better than NBA Baller Beats?

2007
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
President Cat.

2008
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The Eye of Judgment.

2009
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
The Eye of Judgment.

2010
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Sold better than NBA

2011
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Baller Beats. Oh, I feel like this

2012
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
is a game on, like, the $25,000

2013
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
pyramid or something.

2014
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Family Feud or something.

2015
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Name a game that sold more copies

2016
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
than NBA Baller Beats.

2017
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Ready? Go.

2018
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Barbie Horse

2019
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Adventures 2.

2020
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Probably not yet, but we will hit that

2021
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
mark. Bungie Ferret Tossing will sell

2022
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
better than NBA Baller

2023
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Beats.

2024
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Tokyo Jungle will sell more than NBA

2025
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Baller Beats. Oh, I'm sure it already has, yeah.

2026
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Let's see.

2027
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Secrets of the Mystical Unicorn.

2028
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
The game with the pink anus on

2029
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Steam has probably sold more than 3,000 copies.

2030
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I'm trying to think, what

2031
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
was the worst game I can think of that's

2032
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
a paid game? Worst

2033
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
game ever.

2034
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Night Trap sold

2035
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
more than NBA Baller Beats.

2036
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
I was going to say

2037
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Bullet Witch sold more copies than NBA

2038
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Baller Beats. Master Chu and the

2039
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Drunk Nard Who on the NES probably sold

2040
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

2041
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Hell, even

2042
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Steel Battalion, that last one

2043
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
that came out, sold more

2044
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
than that. And it was fucking

2045
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
broken.

2046
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Beatmania sold more copies than

2047
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
NBA Baller Beats.

2048
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Burn!

2049
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Pop and Music on

2050
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Xbox Live Arcade or what was it called?

2051
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Beat and Groovy sold more copies

2052
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
than NBA Baller Beats.

2053
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Do you remember that song

2054
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
that was really obnoxious and horrible

2055
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
last summer, the

2056
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Louie Louie Gucci Gucci Fini Fini Prada

2057
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Basic Bitches Wear That Shit So I Don't Even

2058
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Bother. Her album came out. It's the worst

2059
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
album sale that sold

2060
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
like, it's not quite a record

2061
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
but it sold 3,900 copies

2062
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
in its first week. That's more than this game.

2063
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Creation.

2064
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
What's the single called?

2065
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Gucci Gucci. Gucci

2066
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Gucci. Hold on, I want to look this up.

2067
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
It was just the single.

2068
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Please don't play it. Do you really hate your listeners

2069
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
that much? No, it was just

2070
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
a single last year but she actually

2071
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
put out a full album

2072
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
with that song and no one gave a fuck

2073
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
but more people gave a fuck.

2074
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Okay, so more people

2075
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
gave a fuck about this song.

2076
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
No, that's not it.

2077
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Oh, this one.

2078
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Okay, more people bought

2079
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
this CD than

2080
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
bought Baller Beats.

2081
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Wait, what's the chorus?

2082
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
This is so awful.

2083
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
This is really badass. This is too long. Where's the chorus?

2084
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I can't make it to the chorus.

2085
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
You probably picked the worst part of the song, Dev.

2086
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Whatever.

2087
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So there you go, the worst part of the worst

2088
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
song. Worst part of the worst

2089
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
song and that, and yeah, and Dartusuya

2090
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
says that song was probably in NBA Baller Beats.

2091
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Let's see, Act Dev says more people bought

2092
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
ET on the 2,600 than NBA Baller

2093
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Beats. Jessica Harper said

2094
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Britney's dance beat probably sold more

2095
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
copies than NBA Baller Beats.

2096
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Oh, Rama. Oh.

2097
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Burn. This, oh.

2098
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Ouch.

2099
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Rock Revolution sold

2100
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
more copies than NBA Baller Beats.

2101
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
That's a fact.

2102
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Oh, ouch. Oh, you

2103
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
win. You win an internet.

2104
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
This story's over.

2105
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Marissa. I love Marissa.

2106
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I really do and she's in our chat room

2107
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
and she just said, this bitch

2108
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
just rapped about Adderall.

2109
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
By the way, does this still work?

2110
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I just want to point this out. I want Marissa to know

2111
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
this because this is how bad Marissa needs to come back to

2112
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
the show. Okay, you know how Google, Google

2113
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
has the predictive search feature, right?

2114
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Okay, I want to show you something. Go to Google

2115
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
and type orange

2116
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
lounge

2117
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
radio

2118
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
and oh, of course,

2119
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
the one time I do it, oh, you know why? Because I'm not doing

2120
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
global research.

2121
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
But I swear to God, I did this the other day.

2122
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
I typed in orange lounge radio

2123
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
and in the predictive search, the

2124
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
number two thing that came up said orange lounge

2125
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
radio Marissa.

2126
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Not orange lounge radio

2127
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
chat room, orange lounge radio

2128
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Loki. It was orange lounge

2129
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
radio Marissa. Swear to God, I was looking

2130
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
at this yesterday and I was laughing my ass off

2131
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
in a good way because I love Marissa. But it's just

2132
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
funny that, well, how long ago was it she was

2133
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
on this show?

2134
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Alright, anyhow,

2135
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
let's move on.

2136
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
An appropriate story

2137
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
to follow that last story is

2138
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
about a game design

2139
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
jam called Fuck This Jam.

2140
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
It will, uh,

2141
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I have no, who is putting

2142
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
this on? It's on a website. It's called

2143
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
FuckThisJam.com. Well, that's appropriate.

2144
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Oh, okay, here it is. It's

2145
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
organized by Rami Ismail

2146
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
of Vlambeer

2147
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
and independent designer Fernando Romalo.

2148
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Uh, Fuck This Jam

2149
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
apparently was basically

2150
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
an inside joke. It came out of a conversation

2151
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
that they had when they went to an arcade

2152
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
in Austin, Texas. It will take

2153
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
place from November 9th through the 17th.

2154
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Well, why

2155
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
would you care about this besides the cute name?

2156
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Well, because

2157
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
the participants in this little

2158
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
contest or whatever, they

2159
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
will be tasked with creating a game

2160
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
in a genre or style

2161
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
that you would ordinarily have

2162
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
disdained for. So, in

2163
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
other words, let's say you're the type of person that's like,

2164
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
you know what? I hate sports games.

2165
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
You know, I don't want to play sports. I never play sports

2166
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
games. Then your job in the jam

2167
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
would be to design a sports game.

2168
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Or let's say, you know, I hate first-person shooters.

2169
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
You gotta design a first-person shooter. I hate

2170
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
retro games. I hate role-playing.

2171
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
So, I actually

2172
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
think this is a really neat idea to

2173
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
encourage people to get out of their comfort zones

2174
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
because this is where some of the best ideas come from.

2175
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
And you know it's gonna lend itself

2176
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
to crossover

2177
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
potential. I bet something out of this ends

2178
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
up on Project Greenlight or something. Just you wait.

2179
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Just you wait.

2180
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Good luck to everybody that's participating

2181
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
in that. Fuck this jam.

2182
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Alright, well let's go to the mailbag.

2183
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Every week you guys send us emails

2184
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

2185
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
and we

2186
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
pick our favorites out of the mailbag and read them

2187
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
live on air. Dark Soccer

2188
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
is not here to read them tonight.

2189
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
But Alan, being such a good sport, has volunteered

2190
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
here to read the emails. It probably helped that

2191
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
there was only one. Yes.

2192
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Now there's one

2193
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
email and I

2194
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
really empathize with this

2195
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
person who was kind enough to write it in

2196
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
because when I write stuff I'm often

2197
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
very verbose and go on about something

2198
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I care a lot about. It's a Windows 8

2199
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
rant email and this person

2200
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
did say how long it is.

2201
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
And it is long enough that we're not gonna read the whole

2202
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
thing on the show. It's not personal.

2203
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
So it is

2204
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
from

2205
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
13X

2206
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Forever. And he writes

2207
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
a Windows 8 email and he says,

2208
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you

2209
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
have an empty mailbox problem so I finally took

2210
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
my time to write about that Windows 8 hate

2211
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
show two weeks ago. First off, I

2212
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
love that our show is now a relay

2213
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
to Bobby as well as just like

2214
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
blast us with an email

2215
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
and hope Bobby gets some splash damage

2216
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
from it all.

2217
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
It's an AOE attack. Exactly.

2218
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you have an

2219
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
empty mailbox problem so I finally took my time

2220
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
to write about that Windows 8 hate show

2221
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
two weeks ago. Yeah, this mail will

2222
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
be long so maybe you should skip it

2223
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
for the show. Sorry. Also, I have to apologize in advance

2224
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
if I trail off topic or go

2225
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
on rumble for too long.

2226
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
And then, first

2227
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
of all, I highly recommend to

2228
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
read Paul Allen's take on Windows 8

2229
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
with a link. Interface changes

2230
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
and Rafael Rivera's

2231
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
post on the

2232
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Minecraft certification debacle and

2233
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
optionally his own rant

2234
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
or the person who wrote this in

2235
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
on Google Plus on this topic.

2236
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
And then it goes on and

2237
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
unfortunately we can't read all of it but

2238
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
he did include, thank you

2239
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
writer, a TLDR

2240
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
summary.

2241
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Smart idea when you send in a long

2242
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
email. Include the too long, didn't read

2243
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
portion. So

2244
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
TLDR summary. You should really try it

2245
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
for yourself before judging. Sometimes to

2246
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
build something new you have to break something old and

2247
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
people will hate you for it. All

2248
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
of the hate on the internet for Windows 8 stems

2249
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
from a few articles published by ignorant writers

2250
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
to get more clicks for their websites.

2251
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Desktop experience is the same as for

2252
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Windows 7, only much more polished. Plus

2253
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
you have Metro which is mostly

2254
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
optional. Notch is

2255
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
fighting some illusory

2256
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
threats of software freedom on

2257
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
commercial OS 2 in most unconventional

2258
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
ways. Yes, Windows 8 will sell

2259
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
worse than Windows 7 and everyone will

2260
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
point and laugh. You're probably biased

2261
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Russian neighbor 13x

2262
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
forever. So I'm wondering maybe

2263
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
if I'm on the vlog article

2264
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
for when the podcast, this episode goes up

2265
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
maybe we can include that email. Perhaps.

2266
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
On the forums. On the forums. Yeah, I would say

2267
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
make a long post on the forums. But I

2268
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
will tell you this. I did read the email in its entirety

2269
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
off air. And it was, you know, the

2270
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
TLDR does sum it up pretty good because even

2271
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
though it was through kind of some fanboy

2272
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
filter, I did sense a little bit

2273
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
of that in there. There was

2274
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
a good point that was raised that is essentially

2275
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
don't knock it until you've tried it.

2276
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
You know, many people are sitting here bashing

2277
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Windows 8 just because

2278
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
they've seen some screenshots and

2279
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
they don't like the fact that there's something

2280
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
different. That they're presenting the start menu

2281
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
and it's different. And the kind of,

2282
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
again, I'm paraphrasing here and this is

2283
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
the message I took from it was essentially

2284
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
change is gonna happen.

2285
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Change is inevitable. Change has

2286
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
to start from somewhere. If you like

2287
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
the start menu, didn't the start menu

2288
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
start somewhere, right? So

2289
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
why is everybody hating on this

2290
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
when many of them haven't tried it?

2291
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Granted, some have. But many haven't

2292
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
and they're just looking at these screenshots going

2293
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
oh, I hate this. I hate this because it

2294
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
looks like an Xbox. And I

2295
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
say this being guilty

2296
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
of being someone who usually

2297
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
crawls up Valve's ass at every

2298
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
opportunity. But it wasn't Gabe Newell

2299
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
but someone, there's the whole debacle with Notch

2300
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
bitching about it. But someone at

2301
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Valve, not Gabe Newell

2302
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
basically said we've messed around

2303
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
with the Windows 8 kit and

2304
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
he was like, personally he didn't want to design

2305
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
software for it because he thought it was a big steaming turd.

2306
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
So whenever someone from Valve says something

2307
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
everyone like

2308
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Valve says Windows 8 is garbage

2309
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
and then it just echoes through the whole

2310
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
internet which is not really

2311
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
what they said. Right.

2312
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
The whole game of telephone happens. Yeah.

2313
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
So, interesting. Now I will say

2314
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
there was also a portion of the email that really

2315
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
addressed the whole Windows certification thing

2316
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
and the fact that I think people are reading

2317
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
too much into it and it's not that Microsoft

2318
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
wants a cut. That was a huge part of what

2319
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
the Valve complaint was too.

2320
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
But it's not that, just to be clear, it's not

2321
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
that Microsoft wants a cut of it. It's

2322
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
that Microsoft wants to certify it

2323
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
and I'm assuming it's similar to

2324
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
how they might certify

2325
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
like I know because I've done

2326
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
some of this development at work, like

2327
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
it's harder to run macros

2328
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
and even like access in Word if

2329
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
you don't like certify your

2330
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
content because of the

2331
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
illegitimate stuff that's out there. So like

2332
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
imagine expanding that bubble to include

2333
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
software. That's kind of where it's going.

2334
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Isn't that kind of like the Nintendo

2335
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
official seal of equality where they had to play

2336
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
every game even if it was bad to make sure it was good enough?

2337
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
They don't do that anymore because

2338
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
of course the Wii is the biggest shovelware

2339
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
console in like 10 years.

2340
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Well and also people got around

2341
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
the Nintendo seal of equality. Like it worked for

2342
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
a while but then when it was

2343
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
because Atari

2344
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
and Tengen as it was won that lawsuit

2345
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
where they tried to stop that

2346
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
from happening. They were able to keep

2347
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Tetris off the shelves because that was

2348
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
a particular circumstance but they

2349
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
were not able to keep those cartridges off shelves.

2350
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I can't remember if the lawsuit was Tengen

2351
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
specifically or if it was one of the other companies like

2352
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Color Dreams or you know

2353
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
one of them back in the day but Nintendo tried to stop it.

2354
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
They lost so there was nothing they could do about it.

2355
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
So I think at that point they kind of gave up.

2356
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
But yeah Nintendo,

2357
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Nintendo put those locks into place because they were

2358
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
trying to prevent another video game crash.

2359
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
The other big big big thing they did on the NES

2360
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
remember this. Yeah because a lot of the games on the 2600

2361
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
weren't even designed on proper

2362
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
development kits. They were trash. Yeah.

2363
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Well publishers could only put out three games a year.

2364
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
If you paid for these development kits

2365
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
or whatever you could only put out three games a year.

2366
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
So that's why, well you had these publishers

2367
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
start to put out, just invent

2368
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
subsidiaries to get around it. That's where

2369
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Ultra Games came from. Ultra Games was

2370
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
just Konami. That's all it was.

2371
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
It was just Konami and it existed solely

2372
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
to put out you know

2373
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
more Konami games on the NES

2374
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
like Metal Gear

2375
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

2376
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
or Ultra Games. Yeah.

2377
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
But it was Konami. So anyway

2378
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
that was a

2379
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
total tangent that that emailer was not

2380
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
expecting at all whatsoever but there you go.

2381
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
So at the end of the day let's go back

2382
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
take a step back. What about

2383
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
the course part

2384
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
of the argument I think what I

2385
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
took away from it was

2386
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
don't knock it until you've tried it.

2387
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Alan is it fair?

2388
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
That's fair. You haven't tried it so should you

2389
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
be knocking it? Yeah.

2390
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Windows, well it's, I made a joke once

2391
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
that Windows OS's are like the

2392
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Star Trek movies, the original ones that every other one

2393
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
is a piece of shit and the other, every other one is really good.

2394
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Because

2395
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
XP Professional I ran

2396
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
for years because it was rock solid.

2397
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
When Vista came out

2398
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
they tried to drag

2399
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
gamers over to Vista by saying if you want

2400
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
DirectX 10 you have to use

2401
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Vista. I'm like DirectX

2402
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
fine it's 9 for me I'll stay on

2403
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
XP. And now 7 is so

2404
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
fucking good I can't imagine why I'd want to leave

2405
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
7. 7's great.

2406
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And the bummer

2407
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
is like it's not like you can just like try

2408
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
8 out and then go back. Oh yeah it's a total

2409
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I don't

2410
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
think you can. No I don't think you can

2411
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
down rev Windows. So

2412
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
it's either all in or out.

2413
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Alright well thank you very much for the

2414
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
email even if it was a little long.

2415
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Hopefully we covered the points

2416
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
to your satisfaction and we you know

2417
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
either way we still appreciate the

2418
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
other perspective. It is the show

2419
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
where every gamer has a voice. We

2420
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
get to disagree sometimes.

2421
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Alright let's get into the FUs of the week.

2422
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Uh

2423
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Loki why don't you start us off tonight

2424
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
with your FU. Uh an FU to

2425
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
uh e-machine shop

2426
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
for their fur I'm not working

2427
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
nicely with uh Google Sketch

2428
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
unfortunately. The wonderful

2429
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
painstaking process of creating

2430
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
the part of the

2431
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
beat gear pad or whatever

2432
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
um it came out nice

2433
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
so they can't import it at all.

2434
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
So and I tried recreating it

2435
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
in their stupid cat editor

2436
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
and it sucks.

2437
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
So fuck that.

2438
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Um

2439
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
you know despite all the stress I went

2440
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
through in the past week I had a pretty good weekend

2441
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
so I can't complain too much although I will

2442
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
say FU to my voice.

2443
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
And FU to the fact that I'm getting

2444
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
old. That part kind of sucks

2445
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
and uh yeah I did I didn't just

2446
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
do rock the something keep in mind I didn't

2447
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
just do Rocky on Friday.

2448
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I actually helped out with another performance

2449
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
piece that um some of the gals

2450
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
on cast asked me to do.

2451
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Uh just play a really quick walk on roll

2452
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
in and I did it so I had to do that last night.

2453
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
But it's part of that performance I'm

2454
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
supposed to die on stage which means I have to take

2455
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
a stage fall. Yeah

2456
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
totally bruised my knee during doing that

2457
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
yesterday. So that part sucks.

2458
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
So FU to getting old where my

2459
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
bones are old and frail and I can't

2460
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
take falls like I used to be able to.

2461
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Wah.

2462
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Alan you're FUs of the week.

2463
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Um things are going pretty well for me. I got

2464
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
a second day off this week. Um which I

2465
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
wasn't expecting. So the

2466
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
apartments all clean.

2467
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Uh I hate

2468
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I get paid

2469
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Friday. And you know sometimes when you're like

2470
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
really really really broke waiting for that payday

2471
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
to come up. I'm kind of like that now.

2472
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Sometimes you can avoid it

2473
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
sometimes you can't.

2474
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Alright. There it is

2475
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
the FUs of the week.

2476
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Two more stories and then Twitter topics

2477
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
and the Skype line. So

2478
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Loki. Alright.

2479
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
So there's going to be some price discounts

2480
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
pretty soon for the Xbox 360.

2481
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Coming in the form of their holiday

2482
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
bundles. They're actually going to have two bundles

2483
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
out that um actually look pretty cool.

2484
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
There's one that's going to be

2485
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
the Connect 4 gig

2486
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
um well actually I guess the Connect 4 gig

2487
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
um bundle.

2488
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And they have a 250 gigabyte

2489
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
just regular bundle. Um

2490
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
for 250 you can get a

2491
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
uh holiday bundle which is the

2492
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
250 gigabyte Connect. And

2493
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
those are usually 350 bucks.

2494
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And I guess the bundles have

2495
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
different games packed in.

2496
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
They've got DLC codes for everything from

2497
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Forza 4

2498
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
um Connect Disneyland Adventures Fable 3

2499
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Halo Reach. And

2500
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
also um they're going to have

2501
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I guess codes for a digital copy of

2502
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Skyrim. I actually saw that in one of them.

2503
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Um

2504
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
let's see here. So

2505
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
yeah you can get a 4 gig console for

2506
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
250 or just a regular

2507
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
um

2508
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
system without a

2509
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Connect bundle in there. Um

2510
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
for 250 and that comes with

2511
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Forza and Skyrim as a digital

2512
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
copy. And then also they have

2513
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
a 4 gig Connect

2514
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
um bundle that's going to

2515
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
have um

2516
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
what was in there? Connect Adventures

2517
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
and Connect Disneyland Adventures.

2518
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Well that's kind of stupid. Why would you

2519
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
buy

2520
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
the old one?

2521
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I don't know. For whatever reason I guess

2522
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I'm marking down the old bundles in case you know because it doesn't

2523
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
seem very smart to have the old bundle

2524
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
with less stuff in it for the same

2525
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
for you know more than what it is

2526
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
with more stuff in it. But

2527
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
apparently they still have it at the same price.

2528
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
So you can get the holiday bundle

2529
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
without

2530
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Connect Disneyland Adventures. I guess if

2531
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
you really hate Disney and you just

2532
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
you know fuck it I'm not getting anything extra

2533
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
um

2534
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
you can do that. So those are three bundles

2535
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
that are available. Um

2536
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I guess now. So you can check that out.

2537
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And then um

2538
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
some older holiday bundles too. They've got

2539
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
one with Halo Reach and

2540
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Fable 3. That was the old one.

2541
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
But I guess that's not available anymore.

2542
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Cool.

2543
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
No surprise there. Price drops in time

2544
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
for the holidays. And for Wii U.

2545
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Maybe that it's yeah true competition

2546
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
there and maybe to you know just encourage a few more

2547
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
copies to move after Thanksgiving. Honestly though

2548
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
I mean if you don't give a shit about

2549
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Connect which honestly

2550
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
nowadays you probably shouldn't

2551
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
give a shit about Connect Lisa's console

2552
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
generation. The one with

2553
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Forza 4 and Skyrim is a pretty good deal.

2554
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I mean those are pretty awesome games.

2555
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Good tip.

2556
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Alright one more story

2557
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
for you guys and this is about what could have

2558
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
been uh Blizzard

2559
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
had once planned a version of Diablo

2560
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
for the Game Boy Color.

2561
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Can you even imagine that?

2562
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Ew. Right?

2563
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Like Starcraft on N64

2564
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
you remember that? Now this

2565
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
was uh in a statement from

2566
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
well I shouldn't say a statement but it was more of an

2567
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
interview of Blizzard biographer

2568
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
David Craddock uh in

2569
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
speaking with Shaq News.

2570
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
It was called Diablo Junior.

2571
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
It was intended as a single

2572
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
player only prequel to the original

2573
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
game. Taking a page from

2574
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Pokemon's book the team wanted to

2575
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
release three cartridges

2576
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
each packing a different hero in the

2577
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
warrior rogue sorcerer vein

2578
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
as well as items that players

2579
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
would have to trade for in order to

2580
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
collect.

2581
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Development was only with a

2582
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
handful of staff. They started

2583
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
working on Diablo Junior after the

2584
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
release of Diablo 2.

2585
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
It could have been the Game Boy Color or the

2586
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Game Boy Advance or both

2587
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I guess just due to the timing of all of

2588
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
this. Um

2589
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Diablo Junior was ultimately put out to

2590
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
pasture because of the steep production costs

2591
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
associated with developing handheld

2592
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
games. Uh

2593
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I guess there is a book coming out

2594
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
or a project called Stay Awhile

2595
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
and Listen. It's an unauthorized

2596
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
history of Blizzard based

2597
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
on the testimony of 80X

2598
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
employees. This

2599
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
gonna be good.

2600
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Wow I didn't know somebody was working on

2601
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
something like that. That sounds like it's gonna be amazing.

2602
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Uh apparently there

2603
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
was also another Diablo 2 expansion

2604
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
that never saw the light of day.

2605
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Uh there was um uh

2606
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
it was gonna have guild halls for multiplayer

2607
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
clan meetings and two other character

2608
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
classes that also came out of that.

2609
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Weren't there also a bunch of

2610
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
around the time Warcraft 2

2611
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
between Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 there was gonna be a bunch of

2612
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
orc based side story

2613
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
games? I remember seeing

2614
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
clips of that yeah. And the animation was

2615
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
very, they kinda look like the Zelda CD

2616
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Phillips CDI games. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Same style.

2617
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
They did they did. I wanna know what

2618
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
happened to Starcraft Ghost. I hope we

2619
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
get the low down on that. Yeah.

2620
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Ooh.

2621
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
I like this. The uh unauthorized

2622
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
look. Or they're really awesome franchises

2623
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
from the 90's they haven't touched.

2624
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Like Lost Vikings.

2625
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Or Blackthorn. Or Rock and Roll

2626
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Racing.

2627
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Didn't they also do the shake, rattle, and

2628
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
roll? Was that Blizzard? I don't know.

2629
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
They got more franchise.

2630
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Snake, rattle, and roll. Who did that?

2631
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Is there

2632
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
is more out there than wow

2633
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
and Diablo

2634
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Blizzard.

2635
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Or they could come up with something new. I know

2636
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
that's a uh

2637
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
whatever. Whatever Titan is.

2638
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Whatever Titan is supposed to be completely unique

2639
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
IP. Oh I'm an idiot. Snake, rattle, and roll

2640
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
was just straight up rare.

2641
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Why did I think that was Blizzard?

2642
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Am I really that

2643
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
dumb? I guess

2644
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
so.

2645
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Whatever. Shut up.

2646
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Alright let's go to the

2647
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Skype line at

2648
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
1877 game OLR

2649
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
where our username on Skype is

2650
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is

2651
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
open right now.

2652
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
And while we're waiting for

2653
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
some calls to come in we will do some

2654
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
tweets. Tigerclaw

2655
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
sent in a few tweets tonight. See

2656
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
in here I thought it was a slow news week and yet

2657
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
we've got more stories coming in thanks to

2658
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Twitter so I appreciate that. Tigerclaw

2659
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
on Twitter with a story EA apparently

2660
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
accidentally gave away thousands of

2661
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
free games. Yeah.

2662
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
How the hell did this happen?

2663
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
They had a code that was

2664
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
I think it was for reviewers or something like that

2665
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
for Origin where it gave people

2666
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
$20 off. Yeah it said it was a thanks

2667
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
for completing a survey and it allowed them to

2668
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
download a free game from Origin

2669
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
but the code could be used by

2670
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
anybody. It was an unlimited use

2671
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
code. That's the

2672
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
problem. I'm reading it here on the story. This code

2673
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
is not secured. Someone made EA lose money

2674
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
they're gonna have to commit seppuku in a conference

2675
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
room. Oh my gosh. Alright.

2676
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Apparently it ended up on Reddit.

2677
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Alright let's go to the phones. We got somebody

2678
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
waiting. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2679
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
It's Shane. Hey Shane. How you doing?

2680
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I'm good. How about you guys?

2681
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I'm good. What's on your mind?

2682
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
So I want to talk about

2683
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
a little game called Mass Effect.

2684
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I have never heard of this game.

2685
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Why don't you tell us about it?

2686
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Okay anyway before

2687
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
the new multiplayer

2688
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
stuff came out and the mega DLC

2689
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
stuff got announced

2690
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Mike, I think it's Gamble

2691
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
posted something about how the upcoming

2692
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
DLC is kind of like

2693
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
the shape of things to come

2694
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
and I'm wondering

2695
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
if this DLC

2696
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
is kind of

2697
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
pointing at a more

2698
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
massive multiplayer

2699
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Mass Effect game.

2700
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Because now with the introduction of the

2701
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Volus class. Here we go.

2702
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Mass Effect MMO. Hold on.

2703
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I'm justifying it.

2704
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Alright. With the Volus

2705
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
class apparently it's

2706
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
pretty much just a support class

2707
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
like I mean you can still

2708
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
kill things and be really awesome

2709
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
but it's primarily for

2710
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
support so if you've got a support class

2711
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
your vanguards can take

2712
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
hits like really well

2713
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
and everybody else can do you know shooty

2714
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
things why not something in the

2715
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
vein of like a PSO style game where

2716
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
you have centralized hubs you can

2717
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
still do like

2718
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
massive story missions but

2719
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
it's just all

2720
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
like the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3.

2721
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Okay. So

2722
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
okay sorry. Run this by me

2723
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
again. How is this going to impact the single player

2724
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
side of it though with the expansion?

2725
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
It doesn't. They were saying that

2726
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
the stuff that's coming out

2727
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
is kind of like the shape of things to come

2728
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
for the series. So you're talking more

2729
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
the DLC that came out this past week

2730
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
and not so much the Omega DLC?

2731
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Correct. Oh okay. I don't know why but I was

2732
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
saying when you started this whole thing I thought you meant the Omega DLC

2733
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
and I'm like I don't see where that's going.

2734
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Okay but yeah I get it with the Volus

2735
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
support class and all that. Allen?

2736
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Yeah I made a comment

2737
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
to Rob earlier that

2738
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
even if the Mass Effect

2739
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
MMO never happens

2740
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
pretty much

2741
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
as limited of a model as

2742
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
it is the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

2743
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
might be the closest that we ever get simply

2744
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
because if you have a favorite race

2745
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
with the exception of the Elcor you can pretty much be

2746
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
everything now.

2747
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
And who knows if the Elcor and the

2748
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Hanar don't show up sometime

2749
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
down the line. I could see

2750
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
something happen. Also

2751
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
a Volus. I have one

2752
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
if you want to. We can do a match

2753
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
together after the show if you want to see how they play.

2754
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Would be terrible

2755
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
support for a Vanguard because

2756
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
I couldn't

2757
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
stay close enough to you. They can't

2758
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
hop over cover so they have to actually

2759
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
run around the map. That's

2760
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
kind of adorable in a

2761
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
really weird way. So yeah if a Vanguard

2762
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
biotic charges and fucks

2763
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
off I'm going to have to run to your ass to refresh your shields

2764
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
and that's not going to work. And that's all I

2765
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
do as my Vanguard. I just fly around.

2766
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
But you with my Sentinel

2767
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
worked out alright actually. Yeah we did.

2768
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
We duoed what? Wave 4? Wave 5?

2769
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Yeah now my Sentinel was only level 4 so that was

2770
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
pretty good. Yeah it was collectors too right?

2771
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Yeah it was.

2772
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Which are super fun. They're bastards.

2773
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Commander

2774
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Shepherd just joined our chat room and said

2775
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Hi I'm Commander Shepherd and this is my favorite

2776
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Mass Effect podcast on the Citadel.

2777
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
If only.

2778
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
You jerk. Alright.

2779
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
It'll happen eventually. Is there anything

2780
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
non, well actually

2781
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
let me ask you this question because

2782
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
whenever people bring up Mass Effect

2783
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
podcasts in chat Black Wolf

2784
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
likes to chime in and say there's not enough

2785
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
content out there to substantiate a weekly

2786
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
podcast. That's a lie now though.

2787
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
It's totally a lie. That's a

2788
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
valid answer because

2789
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
every like

2790
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
there is fan fiction

2791
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
there's fan works

2792
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
like art, music, there are

2793
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
books that have been out, comics

2794
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
that have been out, multiplayer updates

2795
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
that come out. Always speculation

2796
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
going on for the next games.

2797
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
There's enough content there for

2798
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
weekly episodes. For sure.

2799
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Well then you need to produce a pilot sir

2800
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
and prove everybody wrong.

2801
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
But how

2802
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
am I supposed to do that and play Pokemon in

2803
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Mass Effect and wow. Alright.

2804
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
And watch Once Upon a Time in

2805
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Walking Dead. You just gave me

2806
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
an excellent opportunity to transition away

2807
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
from Mass Effect for a minute because you've been

2808
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
playing Pokemon Black 2, White 2

2809
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
and I know that you are a

2810
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
almost 30 year old

2811
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
playing Pokemon

2812
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
games. You even, one of the original

2813
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
VoG articles is about your love of Pokemon

2814
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
and how you know you're a little

2815
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
old for it. So how

2816
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
are the new games and why do you still love

2817
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
this series? I'll never

2818
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
not love this series. They're just really

2819
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
fun RPGs and

2820
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
the Pokemon for the most

2821
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
part are adorable and who doesn't want to

2822
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
collect adorable things?

2823
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
That

2824
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
game was really fun. I played it.

2825
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
They're good.

2826
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
They contract good programmers. They really are

2827
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
good.

2828
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
No, there's just, I don't

2829
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
know. It's just fun. In fact

2830
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I'm going to see my

2831
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
friends up near Kansas City this

2832
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
weekend and we're going to have a Pokemon

2833
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
tournament. I was just informed and I was like

2834
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
oh heck yes and they're my age too

2835
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
and they're all excited.

2836
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Alright. I love this comment

2837
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
from Frisbee in the chat room talking

2838
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
about Shane's Mass Effect podcast I'm

2839
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
assuming. Frisbee says

2840
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
there's fan fiction, fan art,

2841
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
fan wank, fan

2842
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
dango, etc.

2843
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
There are Skyrim podcasts that are

2844
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
still going just because of all the mods

2845
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
that you can talk about. Alright, alright,

2846
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
alright. BlackWolf says

2847
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
five weeks in a row.

2848
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Five weeks in a row. You got to have

2849
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
a show that's got five episodes and then

2850
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
What if I make five episodes

2851
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
in one night and then spread them out over five

2852
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
weeks? Some people do that.

2853
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
You don't say that's what

2854
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
you're doing in advance, dummy.

2855
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
That was hypothetical. Why would I

2856
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
cheat like that?

2857
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Alright. As I write this down.

2858
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
What else

2859
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
was I going to ask you because you brought up, oh yes,

2860
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
with Pokemon I know you play in a lot of WoW.

2861
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
How's pet battles going for you?

2862
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I have stopped pet battling because

2863
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I'm trying to level things and get gear

2864
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
but it's like

2865
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
a terrible addiction

2866
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
and I'm trying to cut myself off cold

2867
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
turkey at the moment and I still think about it

2868
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
every so often and when somebody posts that they

2869
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
got a new pet I'm like I wonder how that

2870
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
would be in battle but I'm

2871
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
just not doing anything with it.

2872
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Before we let you go for the night

2873
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
is there any message you want to give to Horde

2874
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
tanks out there that might be listening?

2875
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
That's what I was going to say anyway.

2876
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Glad you brought that up.

2877
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
So if you're a Horde tank

2878
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
preferably a paladin or a warrior

2879
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
and you would like a

2880
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
fun laid back raid group that

2881
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
wants to do content

2882
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
while it's current, please

2883
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
please please

2884
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
server transfer to Proudmoore

2885
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
and get a hold of somebody in

2886
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
the guild Malevolence

2887
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
and we'll find you a home and we won't

2888
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
make fun of you much, I promise.

2889
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Alright.

2890
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
That's it.

2891
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Anything else before I let you go?

2892
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Probably not.

2893
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Oh, except I was very sad because

2894
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Alan you talked about

2895
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Kayden and Shepard fanfic I hadn't

2896
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
read yet and I don't know where to find it.

2897
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
I think I can

2898
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
dig it up.

2899
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
And now I don't have any

2900
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
fix saved to a folder on my hard drive

2901
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I just know what time my user wrote it.

2902
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
I don't have any fix

2903
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
but I definitely have fun awesome pictures

2904
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I found that aren't porn.

2905
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
So I have to make that distinction before

2906
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
it gets a little out of hand.

2907
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
As long as no genitalia

2908
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
is showing it's not porn.

2909
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Oh, there isn't. No. There's none

2910
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
whatsoever. I think that would be weird anyway

2911
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
to have. Alright. I'm ending

2912
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
this conversation before it gets awkward. Bye.

2913
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I'll keep it awkward. Bye.

2914
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
1877

2915
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
GameOLR. Our username on Skype is

2916
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

2917
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
I think there was another Twitter topic.

2918
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Do you have any last minute stories Loki

2919
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
while I bring this one up? No.

2920
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I had the EA one but

2921
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
somebody took it.

2922
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Somebody took it. Well we got another call coming in

2923
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
so hooray for that. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio

2924
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
who's this? Hey hey it's Rama. Hey Rama

2925
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
how you doing?

2926
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Ow. My feet.

2927
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Ooh you're calling in to talk about New York

2928
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Comic Con I bet. More or less

2929
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
I was actually calling in to kind of

2930
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
agree with the whole pirating thing because

2931
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
even in my fandom we have to deal

2932
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
with it. We call the people

2933
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
that bootleg the anime and so forth

2934
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
we call them spoiled entitlement

2935
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
bitches. Ooh.

2936
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
And just because

2937
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
they're spoiled and entitled? They

2938
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
feel that because

2939
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
it comes out in Japan they can download

2940
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
the fan subs and watch all the episodes

2941
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
and decide not to buy it

2942
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
when it comes released here because they

2943
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
feel that I already have it why should I

2944
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
go out and buy it?

2945
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Okay I can feel that

2946
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
because I was about to say when you started your thought

2947
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
I was like uh oh cause I was kinda

2948
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
like that for a while cause like

2949
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
and I've admitted to this in the show in the past

2950
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I have downloaded games that were

2951
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
released in Japan only because

2952
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
I feel if the game companies

2953
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
aren't gonna bother I've also done it with games

2954
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
that were only put out in Europe before they were

2955
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
announced for the America because my thought

2956
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
is if the game companies are not going to

2957
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
put the effort into putting the game

2958
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
out here I'm not gonna pay those

2959
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
import fees and mod my systems

2960
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
and all this stuff or whatever just to

2961
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
uh play the game

2962
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
you know so uh I

2963
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
you know at least could cut the cost

2964
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
out of it and play the game

2965
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
anyway now to be fair

2966
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
uh I did this with Dance Dance Revolution

2967
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
games that came out of Japan but when they released

2968
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I mean I'm guilty of doing that too

2969
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
and when I released the or

2970
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
when they released the American versions of

2971
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
DDR I bought every single one of them

2972
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
so did I so you know to be fair

2973
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
so it's a little different than your scenario

2974
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
because you're saying they watch it and

2975
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
then when they release it in America the

2976
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Americanized version or I mean I guess

2977
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
not really the Americanized version but the

2978
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
you know whatever they end up putting out here they

2979
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
fuck off but also on the same token

2980
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
they do it because they can

2981
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
and let's say

2982
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
the series just comes out in the

2983
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
US and the DVDs are like

2984
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
40 bucks for an entire box

2985
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
set people will go and buy

2986
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
that flight on a box set rip

2987
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
the episodes and put them online

2988
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
they'll even put the full disc

2989
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
online and people will find them

2990
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
and download them because they can

2991
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
well

2992
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
and we that's the same thing with games

2993
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
right some pirates do it because they can

2994
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
yeah and it's like I said if

2995
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Halo 4 comes out at $19.99

2996
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
it'll still be pirate because

2997
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
they want to save that $20 and

2998
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
that same person that doesn't

2999
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
want to drop $19.99 on a game

3000
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
will go buy a spindle of blanks

3001
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
to spread to make copies

3002
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
to give to the French

3003
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
what's this comment you just made in chat Alan

3004
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
that's somewhat on topic with all this

3005
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
oh I was just saying

3006
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
back in the early late late 90s

3007
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
early 2000s I used to order fan subs

3008
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
from anime all the time

3009
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
I don't know if that's what he's talking about

3010
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
specifically Sailor Moon

3011
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
yeah partially

3012
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
and it's become where the companies

3013
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
will contact the fan servers and ask them

3014
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
not to continue with this

3015
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
a lot of them will be like sure no problem

3016
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
some of them are like you know what

3017
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
fuck you we're going to continue to fan sub

3018
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
because we do a better job than you can

3019
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
yeah well a lot of times when

3020
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
a fan sub got a cease and desist

3021
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
that was great news for the community

3022
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
because the only reason why the company was doing that is because

3023
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
we bought the rights to this

3024
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
show it's coming out next year and then the community

3025
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
would be happy because yay they were finally

3026
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
getting it

3027
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Alan to also go with that

3028
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
same thing happened when Full Metal Alchemist came out

3029
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
since Square Enix

3030
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
pretty much helped put it out in Japan

3031
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
when Funimation picked it up

3032
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Square Enix told them you got to translate this

3033
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
pretty much word for word

3034
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
you can't mishap anything here or there

3035
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
they're working on setting up the C&D

3036
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
so all the fan sub are selling them oh they can't

3037
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
do this, they're like sure

3038
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
we'll lay off, we'll step back

3039
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
some of those fan subbers will go behind

3040
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
their backs and continue

3041
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
fan subbing the series under a different title

3042
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
and the C&D goes to them and so on

3043
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
and so forth and so forth

3044
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
well Rama

3045
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I don't want to burn all the time talking about piracy

3046
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
well no it's fine

3047
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
it's a good conversation but I want to hear about a New York

3048
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Comic Con because I hear Travis was there too

3049
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
and Critical Myth I think was there too

3050
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I didn't see Critical Myth

3051
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
but I did front it to the

3052
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
one and only Travis Donovan

3053
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
did you? was that the first time you met him?

3054
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
yes, he freaked the fuck out

3055
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
when I walked up to him with my big old

3056
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
afro

3057
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
hahahaha

3058
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
amazing

3059
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
so what did you do and see in New York Comic Con?

3060
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
what was there to do?

3061
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
I mostly went for the cosplays

3062
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
the exhibition hall was ginormous

3063
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
there was a few indie games there

3064
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
but big games that were there

3065
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
was the Capcom booth showing off

3066
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Darkstalkers Resurrection

3067
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
and then there was the Halo 4 booth

3068
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
and then further down there was Square Enix's

3069
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
new

3070
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Tomb Raider game

3071
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
oh wow I didn't realize they were going to be there

3072
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
that's cool

3073
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
and unfortunately I wasn't able to check out any of these games

3074
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
because Comic Con decided to give

3075
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
just me, press, and the rest of my staffers

3076
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
no press access at all

3077
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
don't

3078
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
and the lines were like 3 and 4 hours long

3079
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
I couldn't even get up in there in time

3080
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
to try out the Wii U

3081
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
aww that sucks

3082
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
sorry to hear it

3083
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
it is what it is I'll just try to get over to Nintendo World later this week

3084
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
well since I know you're all about the cosplay

3085
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
which I know the listeners can hear more about

3086
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
on Anime Jam Session

3087
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Tuesday nights on VOG

3088
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
what was some of the good cosplay you saw?

3089
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
believe it or not

3090
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
I see some pretty good

3091
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
My Little Pony cosplays

3092
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
oh god

3093
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Comic Con is just comics, manga

3094
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
pop culture

3095
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
everything all together

3096
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
that's what it's come down to

3097
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I did see a couple of good

3098
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Master Chief cosplayers running around

3099
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
and the most popular one was Scott Pilgrim

3100
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
oh nice

3101
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
yes

3102
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
very cool

3103
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Black Wolf in Chat says Rama's met two VOG people

3104
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
for the first time in the span of a month

3105
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
because you met Bobby last month huh?

3106
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
yeah when I finally got to the hotel

3107
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
and rested up

3108
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
he shows up in his awesome car and we head on over to Waffle House

3109
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
and chilled

3110
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
as long as I'm still your favorite

3111
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
oh you know that

3112
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
oh and then Travis is going to make you take that back on his show later on

3113
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
is that always the case you know?

3114
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
PAX East is coming up

3115
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
you know one thing we didn't bring up on tonight's show

3116
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I just realized

3117
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
but we should probably address

3118
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
well here's the thing we can talk about it

3119
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
PAX East badges went on sale

3120
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
and then we can mention

3121
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
oh but they're already gone

3122
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
don't get me started on that

3123
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I am so pissed and aggravated about that whole situation

3124
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
why? didn't you get a ticket?

3125
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
yeah my brother got me a ticket

3126
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
and when I got home I got Jovi's ticket

3127
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I got her a Friday, Saturday, Sunday badge

3128
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
that was the only way

3129
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
but the people behind PAX

3130
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
let people buy as many badges as they want

3131
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
and then they went directly to eBay

3132
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
that's why the three day ticket sold out in 24 hours

3133
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
oh lame

3134
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
that's pretty bad

3135
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
I mean if you want to go

3136
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I'm telling you

3137
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
you're better off getting a Friday, Saturday, Sunday

3138
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
because I don't know about you

3139
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I don't think you want to go on eBay

3140
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
and try to drop three bills

3141
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
on a three day badge

3142
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
yeah that's not good

3143
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
it really couldn't have happened

3144
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
on a worse week for me

3145
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I didn't buy a badge

3146
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I am crossing my fingers and toes

3147
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
that our existence can justify at least one media pass

3148
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
exactly

3149
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I will be more than happy

3150
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
to interview developers

3151
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
and have vog articles and coverage on the shows

3152
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
and YouTubes and all that stuff

3153
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
just hopefully that'll work out

3154
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
because otherwise I ain't going

3155
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
but this was just like

3156
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
I spent a disgusting amount of money

3157
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
on Rocky Horror, just ask Allen

3158
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
although it might be a little bit of a stressful point

3159
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
but I spent a lot of money on that shit

3160
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
so I didn't have money for badges

3161
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Rob, I understand Rocky Horror

3162
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
that's your fandom, that's your baby

3163
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
that's your pride and joy

3164
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I can't say anything about that

3165
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
because if it was something of a hobby of mine like that

3166
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I would have done the same thing

3167
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
I spent a lot of money on vog too

3168
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
and these podcasts

3169
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
every podcaster on this network

3170
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
spent a lot of money on what they do

3171
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
but we're not saying that in a

3172
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
pity us

3173
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
we are begging for money

3174
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
we just say it in a

3175
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
it's our hobby, it's our passion, it's what we do

3176
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
we do it for what we love

3177
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
go back to PAX East real quick

3178
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
before I move along

3179
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
they're not even putting the media passes

3180
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
registration up until February

3181
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
that is so weird

3182
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I know

3183
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
so weird, but alright

3184
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
it is what it is, it ain't my con

3185
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
it's a good con, when the con gets here

3186
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
everybody that gets to go will have a good time

3187
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
BlizzCon ain't any better with the way they do it

3188
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
look, the main

3189
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
the most important part is the fact that

3190
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
I secured two rooms

3191
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
for everybody so we have a place

3192
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
to stay, that was the most important thing

3193
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
and we got hotel space from

3194
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Thursday to Sunday

3195
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
you're the bomb, if I'm able to get a media badge

3196
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
I'm gonna be like, Rama

3197
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
and in that case

3198
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
when you come down, me and Jové

3199
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
we'll head on over to the airport and pick you up

3200
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
oh, you're the bestest

3201
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
we try

3202
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
alright, I should let you go so we can go wrap the show

3203
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
alright, take care bro, thanks, bye

3204
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
bye

3205
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
see, Rama's got my back

3206
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
cause I'm his favorite, we already established this

3207
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
take that Bobby, just kidding

3208
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Bobby's gonna be at PAX too

3209
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
I know he's going, so

3210
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
who knows, that's kinda cool

3211
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
because since PAX Prime

3212
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
is the same weekend as DragonCon

3213
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
at least we get to have a little bit of PAX in our lives

3214
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I mean, I shouldn't say that PAX East

3215
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
is less than PAX Prime

3216
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I like the timing of PAX Prime

3217
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
with the exception of the fact that it's the same weekend as DragonCon

3218
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
I like the timing of PAX Prime

3219
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
a little more than PAX East

3220
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
but I know we'll have a good time at PAX East

3221
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
if I get to go

3222
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
anyhow, I think that's gonna do it

3223
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I think that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight

3224
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
cause those are some long calls

3225
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
but thank you guys so much

3226
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
to those that called in

3227
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
if for whatever reason you weren't able to get through tonight

3228
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
do send us an email

3229
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
cause we're always short on emails

3230
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
mailbag at orangelaundry.com

3231
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
one more Twitter topic here I want to read about

3232
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
and it has to do with Wing Commander

3233
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
so it's worth mentioning

3234
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
weren't you a fan of Wing Commander back in the day, Alan?

3235
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I know I was

3236
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
well get this, and this is another tweet from Tiger Claw

3237
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Chris Roberts announced a new game called Star Citizen

3238
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
didn't we talk about those earlier?

3239
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
did we?

3240
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
I forgot about it if we did

3241
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
it was in chat, I don't think we talked about it on the show

3242
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
I think it was on Bobby's show

3243
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
at the end, but it wasn't on our show

3244
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
anyhow

3245
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
oh well, then I'm saying it twice, it's Wing Commander, deal

3246
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
um

3247
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Star Citizen from Chris Roberts is happening

3248
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
it's a Kickstarter

3249
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
it's a crowdfunded game

3250
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
but you know

3251
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
it's already raised

3252
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
$455,000

3253
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
with the crowd funding, that's crazy

3254
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
so

3255
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
it's probably going to make at least a million

3256
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
so you can look for the return of Wing Commander

3257
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
even though it's not called Wing Commander

3258
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
but it's from the same guy

3259
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
and obviously it has a spaceship based name

3260
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
so it's going to be the next evolution

3261
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
of that series

3262
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
hopefully it will turn out better than the movie

3263
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
you know, I almost backed that Obsidian one

3264
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I realized that the game's not coming out until 2014

3265
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
so I was like, fuck that

3266
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
that is a long way away

3267
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
not gonna wait

3268
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
alright

3269
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
that wraps up, if you have no other

3270
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
stories for us, Alan, I don't know if you have anything

3271
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
I don't have any links or anything

3272
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
but I have something quick

3273
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
for those who are in my

3274
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
age group who remember a show called

3275
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Siffle and Ollie on MTV

3276
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
yes!

3277
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
they're back, and they're on the Machinima

3278
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
channel reviewing fake

3279
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
video games, and it's like they never left

3280
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
I don't

3281
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
because I think this happened a couple weeks ago

3282
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
when the first one showed up, and I don't remember if we

3283
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
brought it up on the show or what

3284
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
but yes, it is hilarious

3285
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
because in the mid and late 90s, you know, MTV

3286
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
did stop showing a lot of music

3287
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
videos

3288
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
for original content, but back in the mid and late

3289
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
90s, that content was actually good

3290
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
because there was

3291
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
liquid television

3292
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
and all this really weird indie shit

3293
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
that kind of honestly paved the way for

3294
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
a lot of the shows on Adult Swim

3295
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
where you're like, do I need to be

3296
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
smoking weed to be watching this shit?

3297
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
what the hell is this?

3298
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Siffle and Ollie was one of those shows

3299
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
and yeah, they're back

3300
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Liam, the guy who

3301
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
invented them and wrote them and does the voices

3302
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
was on the Nerdist podcast

3303
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
and he was talking, Chris Hardwick

3304
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
was like, I wish the Nerdist channel

3305
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
had snagged him up

3306
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Siffle and Ollie are on Machinima

3307
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Nice. They're good for lulz

3308
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Let's see, episode 1 has

3309
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
92,000 views, not too bad

3310
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Not too bad

3311
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Alright, well thank you very much

3312
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

3313
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Thank you guys who tuned in and support

3314
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Orange Lounge Radio tonight, whether it be through the podcast

3315
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
or on Stitcher

3316
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
or wherever, and if you're

3317
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
tuning in live, a big thank you

3318
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
for sticking through all the upsies

3319
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
and downsies of the stream, it looks like we've been okay

3320
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
for the past hour, people stopped complaining

3321
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
in part B, so I guess it was just for

3322
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
30 minutes there or so, it was a little rough

3323
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
but thank you guys for sticking with it, we really appreciate

3324
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
you guys, you troopers

3325
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio

3326
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
remember we don't ask for your money to do this shit

3327
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
all we ask is help spread the word

3328
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
about Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two

3329
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
or leave us a nice review on something like iTunes

3330
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
or a recommendation on Stitcher or TuneIn

3331
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
or any other site, wherever you heard

3332
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
of this show, there are plenty of other people

3333
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
looking for something like

3334
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
this, so word of mouth is great

3335
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Let's

3336
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
go around and get everybody's final thought

3337
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Alan, as always, thank you for pinch hitting his host

3338
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
tonight, especially on such short notice, really

3339
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
appreciate it, glad we could have you on

3340
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
even if you do live here, and you know

3341
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
you usually get picked on anyway, but

3342
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
you're always great to have on. Do you have a final

3343
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
thought for listeners tonight? No

3344
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Bye

3345
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
I'm tired, I'm on a nap, but you can't nap at 9 o'clock

3346
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
that's called going to bed

3347
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
and then you're like a senior citizen

3348
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
You wanna go to IHOP and get a senior citizen

3349
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
special, one piece of bacon and a pancake?

3350
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
I guess an under sedation person

3351
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
after Rocky on Friday

3352
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
was asking Jessica where

3353
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
the big after party was, like

3354
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Denny's, you know, we're gonna get coffee and chicken strips

3355
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
and it's like, remember when we were all 23?

3356
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
That's not happening

3357
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Actually, actually

3358
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
you know what's funny, I got invited

3359
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
to go to Mel's by one of the cast members

3360
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
and I was like, I'm sorry

3361
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I gotta go home

3362
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
It felt bad

3363
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Our whole lives are ahead of us

3364
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Let's be until 4

3365
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Oh, you kids

3366
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Alright, let's see

3367
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

3368
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I don't know

3369
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Hopefully play some Borderlands 2

3370
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
this week

3371
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
My final thought is, hopefully

3372
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I'll play something besides WoW and Mass Effect

3373
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
this week, not that those are bad games

3374
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Also, my other

3375
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
final thought is, it is nice to finally

3376
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
be honored with the Golden Lotus

3377
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Damn you dailies

3378
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Alright

3379
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to our show

3380
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
We really appreciate you guys

3381
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Let's all hope Jamie feels better and she'll be back next week

3382
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
That would be fantastic

3383
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
And we hope all you guys will come back next week as well

3384
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Be safe, don't be a dick

3385
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
online, treat each other with respect

3386
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
