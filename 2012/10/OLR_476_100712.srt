00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:25,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, October 7th, 2012, Sony sues a former spokesman, cheating allegations emerge in the playoffs of one PC game competition, and could pornography be on the way to the Xbox 360?

2
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:36,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,734
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 476 for October the 7th of 2012.

4
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:53,259
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be listening to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, head on over to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

5
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,882
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or some other type of smartphone application...

6
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:03,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's cool too, but please pencil us in some time for a live show.

7
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:11,355
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

8
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:19,865
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here to talk about video games and all that good stuff with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host tonight here, Loki.

9
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:20,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

10
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,926
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?

11
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:22,787
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing fine.

12
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:23,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

13
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:24,748
[SPEAKER_05]: What's new with you?

14
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:25,429
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your day?

15
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it was good.

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a lot of non-gaming stuff, like mowing the backyard.

17
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:32,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn that real life stuff!

18
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:33,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it all!

19
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:34,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been putting it off for a while.

20
00:01:34,896 --> 00:01:39,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, once the weather gets cooler, then I'll do it, and then finally the weather got cooler, so I had to do it.

21
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:46,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, now before the chat room starts conspiracy theories, you'll notice I did not introduce DarkSakura.

22
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:49,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We do love DarkSakura, but she is not here tonight.

23
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:52,069
[SPEAKER_05]: She ditched our ass to go hang with gays at Disneyland.

24
00:01:52,589 --> 00:01:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, can you blame her, let's be honest.

25
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the happiest place on earth after all.

26
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So she is wrapping up her trip at Disneyland.

27
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:00,892
[SPEAKER_05]: She should be back for the next live show.

28
00:02:01,552 --> 00:02:02,833
[SPEAKER_05]: No sub co-host tonight.

29
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan's usually our standby co-host.

30
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:05,533
[SPEAKER_05]: He had to work.

31
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:12,034
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a call out on Twitter, but I was a little late in doing that because I've been a little bit busy too with some other stuff going on.

32
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:19,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just Loki and I here in studio with you guys in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

33
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:23,677
[SPEAKER_05]: The always present fourth guest on our show, or I guess tonight, third guest on our show.

34
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:28,159
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf in our chat says, I can blame her, just like I blame Rob.

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,240
[SPEAKER_05]: F you, buddy.

36
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:32,342
[SPEAKER_05]: What am I being blamed for?

37
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

38
00:02:34,123 --> 00:02:36,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess Bobby does not want to go to Disneyland.

39
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:40,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Did perhaps you introduce Jamie to the love of Disneyland?

40
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it was the other way around.

41
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was the dealer.

42
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, in this case, Jamie was the dealer.

43
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember the OLR lesbians, Chris and Meg Zee?

44
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:50,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Big giant pyramid scheme.

45
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:12,283
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:29,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Who started Minecraft?

47
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that me or was that you?

48
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was kind of you on Xbox.

49
00:03:34,483 --> 00:03:41,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we were both on Xbox and then I decided to do the PC version and then unfortunately it was just downhill from there.

50
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

51
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:03,652
[SPEAKER_04]: The officially recognized gayest place on earth would be San Francisco.

52
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, it's just today.

53
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I would argue the gayest place on earth is a Scissor Sisters concert in West Hollywood.

54
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do I know?

55
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:18,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, that's one of those temporary designations.

56
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:19,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

57
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:23,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas any other time it goes back to San Francisco.

58
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:35,504
[SPEAKER_05]: There actually is, if I remember right, in New York New York listeners, help me out here But right off of Christopher Street, which I recall is the gay district there There is a street called Gay Street

59
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:37,265
[SPEAKER_05]: If I remember right.

60
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: New York listeners, correct me if I'm wrong.

61
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's several of you listening.

62
00:04:41,046 --> 00:04:50,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our chat room at chat.live.vognetwork.com You have one home for so many years, it's hard to beat it out of your head.

63
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:51,089
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

64
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:53,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

65
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad from PodCultures in our chat saying, Rob Roberts, so Disney and games are social diseases now?

66
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:02,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's not call it a disease.

67
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe just their distractions.

68
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,524
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Ranma confirming for me.

69
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:11,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is a gay street over in the West Village.

70
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:11,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ranma.

71
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:16,509
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if she was rich enough, she would totally be buying that replica Haunted Mansion that they have.

72
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about that.

73
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,991
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that all about?

74
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:22,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a four-story actual replica?

75
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:26,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a replica, except when they show the inside, I'm like, that doesn't look like the Haunted Mansion at all.

76
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,057
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't resemble anything that I've seen.

77
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:32,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember there being a nice kitchen set and all this stuff.

78
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:35,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it's not the Nightmare Before Christmas version.

79
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:35,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.

80
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Haunted Mansion.

81
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Nightmare Before Christmas.

82
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:38,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like them.

83
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:40,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the Ikea version.

84
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's unfortunately a whole other nightmare there.

85
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:44,716
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

86
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:48,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get to our gaming weeks, we always like to start off with a kickoff topic.

87
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to tell you, I'm kind of in the same boat as Loki.

88
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:54,964
[SPEAKER_05]: We've both been very busy lately just with other stuff going on.

89
00:05:55,244 --> 00:06:01,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know specifically what Loki's had going on, but I know here locally, I am working very hard with...

90
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:08,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other people you might know actually, Jessica Harper from Understation Lives, Saturday nights here at VOG Network is a big part of this too.

91
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:18,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to bring the Rocky Horror Picture Show back to Sacramento, which to take a trip down memory lane, I've been involved with Rocky Horror since like 98.

92
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:27,467
[SPEAKER_05]: and the first internet radio show I was on after my college radio shtick was Under Station Live, which was born of Rocky Horror.

93
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:32,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can kind of thank Rocky Horror for getting me into internet radio in the first place in a roundabout way.

94
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:38,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's finally coming back to Sacramento and oh my gosh, it has been a lot, a lot of work and a lot of money and a lot of time.

95
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, it's going to be great.

96
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I really can't wait for the show.

97
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it does kind of cut into the gaming time a little bit.

98
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've had the same experience with the stuff you've had going on.

99
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,993
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I only did the lawn mowing.

100
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:53,396
[SPEAKER_04]: That was like two hours of today and that was it.

101
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,321
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of the week it hasn't been any of that.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all.

103
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,240
[SPEAKER_05]: The show is Friday.

104
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,721
[SPEAKER_05]: If you happen to be in Northern California, I urge you to check it out in Sacramento at the Colonial Theater.

105
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,582
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 o'clock on Friday, October 12th is the big show.

106
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hosting it.

107
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:12,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will be a very crazy, different side of me than what you see.

108
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:13,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Even worse than Horde House.

109
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,463
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I'm going to say about that.

110
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:19,084
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if you're local, please come see the show.

111
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:25,405
[SPEAKER_05]: But after that, I will finally have some time to get caught up on a few things that I've been neglecting, like VOG.

112
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:29,014
[SPEAKER_05]: and video games, playing games and things like that.

113
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:44,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just around the right season for Halloween and scary games and things of that sort going on, which I thought we could talk a little bit about scary video games and games, you know, seasonal Halloween games.

114
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:50,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Loki, do you ever play scary games that actually scare you?

115
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:58,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I know you maybe don't want to admit this, but do you ever play, like, scary video games that actually make you scared, legit scared?

116
00:07:59,232 --> 00:07:59,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

117
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:32,273
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I honestly don't really play any scary games because I don't have a lot of time for that stuff, let alone time to turn off lights and play a scary game.

118
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:38,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really into Silent Hill, which is fine because all the Silent Hills nowadays are kind of eh.

119
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:39,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

120
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:45,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember, though, speaking of Silent Hill, I remember when you and I were living together a while ago.

121
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:48,020
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been, like, in the early days of OLR.

122
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,062
[SPEAKER_05]: That was right when Silent Hill 4, The Room, was new.

123
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:54,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was playing through that one night, and I legit got scared.

124
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:55,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I, like, screamed.

125
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:57,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I let out, like, this total, like, girl scream.

126
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Because something really scary happened.

127
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I walked into a room, and there was, like, one of those two-headed baby monsters was coming right at me.

128
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:05,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, ah!

129
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:08,937
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're sitting over there playing Final Fantasy XI or something.

130
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,360
[SPEAKER_05]: You just kind of look over like, what the hell's wrong with you?

131
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Your response was classic.

132
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:18,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You were being highly insensitive and it was hilarious.

133
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:19,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like me.

134
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:45,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Locopoco in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says scariest game ever Spice World see everybody's going for the what's your favorite scary movie showgirls they're going for that answer Spice World is one of the most hilarious video games ever I could tell another story about that but I won't about friends playing that game and just laughing and laughing and laughing a lot

135
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:47,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

136
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:50,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the bus has the same technology as the TARDIS.

137
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:53,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot bigger on the inside than it actually is.

138
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:54,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a British thing.

139
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:58,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the secrets that the British folks have figured out.

140
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about physics?

141
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:02,774
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.

142
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it entertaining.

143
00:10:04,936 --> 00:10:08,881
[SPEAKER_05]: WhatUpG in our chat says, when does that new Silent Hill movie hit and should I see it?

144
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the last weekend of the month, right?

145
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably near Halloween.

146
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:21,456
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the new Silent Hill game, which is on the Vita, that's been delayed forever and it's finally coming out on the 16th.

147
00:10:21,616 --> 00:10:23,338
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably your next Silent Hill bit.

148
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,660
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's pretty much it.

149
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it looks good.

150
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got, what's his name from, I don't know what the hell his name is really, from Game of Thrones.

151
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:39,844
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of, or I should say a lack of scary movies this year, isn't there?

152
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Because usually we have a Paranormal Activity.

153
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,626
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a Paranormal Activity 4.

154
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen any of those movies.

155
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:50,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a Paranormal Activity 4, there's Insidious, which apparently is really good.

156
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's no Saw anymore.

157
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:54,350
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the Saw's done, yeah.

158
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:54,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.

159
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated those movies.

160
00:10:56,411 --> 00:11:00,334
[SPEAKER_04]: They had... I'm trying to think what else they had.

161
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:03,797
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one... I think it already came out, though.

162
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:07,659
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one that was... The Chernobyl Diaries.

163
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:08,340
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one.

164
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That was supposed to be alright.

165
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:12,062
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, Paranormal Activity 4...

166
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think what other ones there are.

167
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

168
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:20,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Dark Tetsuya with the save there.

169
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:22,991
[SPEAKER_05]: October 26th, if I recall correctly.

170
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:26,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf with the gaming reference.

171
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:29,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Paranormal Activity 4 apparently uses the Kinect to detect ghosts now.

172
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I read something about that.

173
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta keep it current.

174
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

175
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:37,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just in a scene.

176
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:39,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

177
00:11:40,227 --> 00:11:45,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane Alinko is in our chatroom saying, the little Goomba-like enemies in Braid freak me out for no reason.

178
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:51,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess sometimes there's certain mobs that are just really creepy looking in video games that might kind of freak you out.

179
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:52,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

180
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe just hits that nerve?

181
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:56,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

182
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:00,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, live.vognetwork.com if you want to comment along with the show.

183
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:08,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish DarkSakura was here so I could ask her about scary games because I know she's played her share of them, but oh well, we'll get her answer next week as we ramp up to Halloween.

184
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about video games we have been playing, what little there may be.

185
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:14,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I at least have one new game to talk about.

186
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you got, Loki.

187
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:16,875
[SPEAKER_05]: How was your gaming week?

188
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:21,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this week I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, as I normally do.

189
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going for what I call Streak Week, which means I won every single game of the week.

190
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:28,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed it by one.

191
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:31,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed it by one and by three points.

192
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:36,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just because we were down the plane with only three people, and it was a small map, and it was just one of those games where...

193
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:48,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd end up spawning on the opposite side of the map as the other two guys, and they'd get killed, and then they'd spawn the other side by the time I got over there, and it was just back and forth like that.

194
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, I just wasn't able to rack up enough kills.

195
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:54,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't win the game prior to that by quite a bit.

196
00:12:54,258 --> 00:13:02,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually was doubling or tripling their scores, but I got 16 out of the... What was it?

197
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:02,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Not even 16.

198
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:03,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like...

199
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:05,983
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

200
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:40,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Go up to the chest and move it from the chest or your survival inventory into the chest.

201
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:42,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to fill it all back up again.

202
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:50,891
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just open the chest, open the creative inventory or whatever and just drop everything in there that you want, which would be ideal.

203
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:55,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, stupid ass me actually destroyed my chest and everything in it.

204
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:57,435
[SPEAKER_05]: But thankfully to creative mode, I could put it all back.

205
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:58,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some.

206
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:00,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

207
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:01,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that.

208
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:02,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

209
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:18,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of, well, I had, prior to Rob getting on the server, I was hustling to get the giant snowman done, because, you know, the snowman went with the snow golems that were in his house, and the mooshrooms, which my friend put in there.

210
00:14:18,464 --> 00:14:19,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks for that, by the way.

211
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:20,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are fun.

212
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:32,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted, well, originally I was going to have... That was a scary moment in video games, by the way, when I logged into that, and then all of a sudden, and it's like, moo.

213
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Cows can be kind of scary, just so you know.

214
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,179
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're changing all the sound effects for those cows soon.

215
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:38,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

216
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the next update, they're going to have witches and bats.

217
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a Halloween update, so witches, bats, and some other fun stuff.

218
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,973
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to have witches' huts, and they're going to redo all the sound effects for things.

219
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:52,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

220
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:56,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so Minecraft, I actually did start working on a little bit.

221
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,657
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

222
00:14:57,957 --> 00:15:03,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Hitsun's been making this kind of wild network of portals to the nether and stuff so you can walk around the map.

223
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:13,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been... I was dressing up one of those portals because it was near my castle, so I was going to incorporate that into the castle a little bit.

224
00:15:13,863 --> 00:15:18,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, maybe I should just expand my castle a little bit more since I was kind of having fun doing that.

225
00:15:18,965 --> 00:15:19,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

226
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:24,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to stay away from making giant spheres in the game because that's a pain in the ass.

227
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did, you know, that snowman was huge.

228
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:33,017
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I was originally going to have it where you'd step on something and it'd shoot snowballs at you, but it got too tall.

229
00:15:33,257 --> 00:15:41,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I put arrows in it now, but it still shoots, all it does is shoot the, like, billboard, which is kind of, you know, ridiculous, but...

230
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:46,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So you built something to actually shoot the ad for Orange Lounge Radio that somebody built in.

231
00:15:46,986 --> 00:15:50,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't there when I was originally building that.

232
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:51,727
[SPEAKER_04]: But they built it in there.

233
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever.

234
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:53,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.

235
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:57,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, what else did I play?

236
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:01,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was something else.

237
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it something on my phone?

238
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:32,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Vita I downloaded the LittleBigPlanet demo so I haven't gotten a chance to check that out yet but I was going to because I charged my Vita again because I haven't been using it but I do want to pick up I may pick up LittleBigPlanet on that what else what else supposed to get Dishonored soon so I'll have that I don't know if I'm going to play it though it's one of those things I may just sell it I got Resident Evil 6 that's going

239
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have not heard good things about Resident Evil 6.

240
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,713
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some people that are talking about it in chat.

241
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:40,855
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few people, I've just been kind of keeping my eye on chat.

242
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are saying it's really not that bad.

243
00:16:42,997 --> 00:16:45,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard something about a final boss that's kind of strange.

244
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:46,639
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks very over the top.

245
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,002
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is something, like, I don't know who any of these characters are, because...

246
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't follow the series at all.

247
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:56,287
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something I haven't gotten into and I don't really want to get into now.

248
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Dishonored looks alright, so I'm kind of interested in that.

249
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:06,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern Warfare, or not Modern Warfare, Black Ops 2 looks interesting, so I'll hopefully check that out once that gets around here.

250
00:17:06,354 --> 00:17:08,816
[SPEAKER_04]: A whole lot of drama with that.

251
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:10,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Here come some of the comments.

252
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:14,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, Red and Evil 6 is not that bad.

253
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Which says to me, it's kind of bad, but it's not that bad.

254
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:20,125
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a long time fan, maybe you'll put up with it.

255
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:24,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, someone else.

256
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:28,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Codeman's asking a question about your Minecraft habits in another game that you've talked about before.

257
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Codeman says, Loki, have you gotten the Minecraft sniper rifle in Borderlands 2?

258
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It shoots Minecraft arrows.

259
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:37,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

260
00:17:53,528 --> 00:17:59,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really bothered to try to play it yet, but it's been a while since I've been playing Borderlands.

261
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the ones I was trying to go back and play this week, but I just didn't get a chance to.

262
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Minecraft because I haven't had access to the TV.

263
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for it to get done with the season.

264
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,397
[SPEAKER_04]: She's on season 5 right now out of 7.

265
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,018
[SPEAKER_04]: When did she start?

266
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:16,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that sounds like pretty fast progress to me.

267
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

268
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:19,830
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

269
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:27,735
[SPEAKER_04]: God, that show's terrible.

270
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not terrible.

271
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:37,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just you can totally tell when they switched up the writers because the first two seasons were all right, and then the third season, it got weird.

272
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,218
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fourth season, it got really weird.

273
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:42,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like you've been watching a lot of it too.

274
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,859
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been just because it's on TV.

275
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've actually watched some of it before, but the fifth season, it's kind of back to how it was before.

276
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:50,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like...

277
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:54,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that was when the writer's strike was or something like that.

278
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:55,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really strange.

279
00:18:55,582 --> 00:18:57,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, no Medium talk here.

280
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Too late.

281
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Critical Myth in chat says, Medium is a terrible show.

282
00:19:02,064 --> 00:19:03,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I sympathize, Loki.

283
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Thankfully, I've already spoiled it for my wife.

284
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:10,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, she spoils all the books for me anyways.

285
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:13,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so that's it.

286
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably go back and play some more Minecraft.

287
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:16,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been having fun with that.

288
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: My coworkers are having fun.

289
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:18,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

290
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:22,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to figure out plugins that I want to put in there.

291
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:31,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, see, the server that I run can run... It's basically got... It's Multicraft is the front end, and it's got a bunch of different server types you can do.

292
00:19:31,983 --> 00:19:32,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do a default.

293
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do, like, a vanilla server, an optimized Minecraft server, then bucket...

294
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:42,511
[SPEAKER_04]: A bucket server and a bucket beta server.

295
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And bucket's basically a server that has plugins in it.

296
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:49,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can add different bucket plugins to the game to do different things.

297
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:56,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things I did, which doesn't require bucket, is I enabled Raise Mini Maps, which is actually pretty awesome.

298
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of the things that, like, I'd explore the map and I'd get lost.

299
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wouldn't be able to figure out where the hell my, you know, how to get back.

300
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:07,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than doing a teleport, which I've been doing.

301
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:14,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I have waypoints and so I know, okay, my house is in that direction.

302
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know where I'm going and stuff.

303
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:16,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did that.

304
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:18,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one thing I did do in Minecraft.

305
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:25,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I went back to the village because there's a village with actual villagers around there and their village was terrible because it spawned and

306
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:44,161
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like doorways that they can't get to so I made them a really terrible looking pink wool house that they can go into and I spawned a bunch of villagers in there and a bunch of these iron golems to defend them against the zombies because all they were doing is like getting eaten by zombies so I had to repopulate.

307
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it.

308
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:48,049
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm looking for plugins.

309
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:48,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do the planes.

310
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:55,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do the planes, but that requires like Minecraft Forge, and I'm not really sure how to install that on a server that's not really mine.

311
00:20:55,276 --> 00:21:03,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't have access to the files that, you know, I think I have to ask them to upgrade, you know, us when the new Minecraft version comes out or something like that.

312
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:04,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have to do it.

313
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:05,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they do it automatically.

314
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:33,458
[SPEAKER_04]: so I had to figure that out and I wanted to do the planes would be awesome and maybe the guns I do want to do like a mob arena where we can just set up there's I think a bucket plugin where you set up an area and you can just have it where you fight mobs and then when you die depending on how many mobs you kill you get a reward and you don't really die in the game you don't lose anything but you just die in the arena so it would be kind of cool might set that up that's it

315
00:21:33,863 --> 00:21:37,866
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, I don't want to turn this into the Minecraft show, but I played a little bit of Minecraft as well.

316
00:21:38,626 --> 00:21:43,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I logged into the server and promptly got scared like hell as to all that crap that they put in my house.

317
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,073
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went outside and I saw on this VOG server they've just built everything around my house.

318
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:55,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And I use this analogy on Bobby's show as well, but it's like you're the one holdout in the neighborhood who won't sell their house.

319
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like that old guy in Up where everything is built around the house.

320
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,260
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're trying to buy your house.

321
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, you know what?

322
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna, I'm gonna bulldoze my house and go somewhere remote.

323
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:05,942
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like I won't ever be able to get back.

324
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:08,203
[SPEAKER_05]: We could build an elaborate rail car unit or whatever.

325
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went to an unexplored part on my map that was just due south.

326
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:14,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I just headed south of all that stuff.

327
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:19,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Codeman in chat says, I got lost looking for Sky's new house.

328
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:19,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I went south.

329
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:28,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a brick house that's up on a hill that's half finished unless Bobby, I think somebody was threatening to finish it for me.

330
00:22:28,693 --> 00:22:31,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't finish... I technically didn't finish this field.

331
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:33,556
[SPEAKER_04]: All I did was just flatten it out, okay?

332
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:34,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a joke now.

333
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:36,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do.

334
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:37,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'll just flatten up this mountain.

335
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:38,739
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he won't mind.

336
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,260
[SPEAKER_05]: But I started to build my little brick house.

337
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the idea of being a little bit farther away from all the action outside the city.

338
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:47,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my summer home.

339
00:22:47,603 --> 00:22:47,764
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

340
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:51,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was working on that a little bit, but I didn't have a whole lot of time for Minecraft.

341
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:56,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play a little more World of Warcraft, because obviously the expansion is still pretty great.

342
00:22:57,188 --> 00:23:00,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave all my thoughts on that to HordeHouse.com.

343
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I will talk about a new game, however.

344
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:06,553
[SPEAKER_05]: The new game I want to talk about this week is... Did the stream go down?

345
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:08,294
[SPEAKER_05]: People in chat are saying it went down.

346
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:12,016
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I show that we're still submitting data, so I don't know what the hell's going on.

347
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:14,497
[SPEAKER_05]: The joys of doing live radio.

348
00:23:15,438 --> 00:23:19,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have nothing, like, Alan's not even here tonight, so he's not playing Mass Effect or anything.

349
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not doing anything.

350
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:23,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's, her computer's not even here because she's not here, so we've got very little data.

351
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,524
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, yeah.

352
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:31,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well anyway, hopefully you all get back in time to hear me talk about the one game, new game, I did play this week.

353
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:32,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is kind of important.

354
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

355
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:57,747
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was a game from Japan that I think the actual name of it was like Tsukiban Suchaorena Wii or something like that.

356
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Tsukiban Suchaorena Wii.

357
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably butchered that name a little bit.

358
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:03,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Apologies to Japanese listeners.

359
00:24:03,731 --> 00:24:04,931
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was the game.

360
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:09,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we were looking at pictures of the game, we were like, oh my gosh, this looks amazing.

361
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:13,796
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you play as this cat doing these crazy things like driving a car and doing all this stuff.

362
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:16,097
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, where are these games in America?

363
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:16,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

364
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:40,305
[SPEAKER_05]: where are these new ideas where are these things we haven't seen before that are for the lols and hilarious and we uh started i think we got our listeners to tweet the people that made the game and it caught some of the game bloggers attention like we ended up being on joystick and some of the other sites because of it like you know orange launch radio took it upon themselves to make president cat happen and then there was that whole follow-up article about how

365
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:49,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Suki Ban Sochao Renowi supposedly only sold 100 copies the week it came out, which I still claim is bullshit and somebody going for a sensationalist headline to this day.

366
00:24:49,074 --> 00:24:49,715
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those was mine.

367
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

368
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:51,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, Loki bought it.

369
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:52,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway...

370
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,922
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is ever a time to get President Cat, it is now.

371
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:01,823
[SPEAKER_04]: The presidential race is on.

372
00:25:03,223 --> 00:25:05,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Vote number three, President Cat.

373
00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:11,447
[SPEAKER_05]: It was 2008 because I remember there was an ad that was poking fun at the Obama Hope campaign.

374
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was 2008 when all that went down.

375
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:25,371
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, the point is, and why I bring that up to Tokyo Jungle, is that here is a game that's kind of that same crazy Japanese idea, but it's actually coming out here.

376
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:38,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole trick of it is that humans are gone, it's this world where the animals are basically fighting to survive, because humans are gone, but the cities are still there.

377
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:42,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the zombie apocalypse happened or something, but animals are still alive.

378
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:48,359
[SPEAKER_05]: You get to unfold part about what happened as you play more and more of the game.

379
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,741
[SPEAKER_05]: But you basically select what animal you want to play the game as.

380
00:25:52,882 --> 00:25:53,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And you start with two.

381
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:56,364
[SPEAKER_05]: You start with one carnivore and one herbivore.

382
00:25:56,684 --> 00:26:00,927
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can play as a little Pomeranian dog, is the carnivore that you start as.

383
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:02,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can play as some type of deer.

384
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:07,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a silka deer, I think it's called, or something, is the herbivore that you can start with.

385
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:09,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you.

386
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,413
[SPEAKER_05]: OffCanonogram says it was October 22, 2009.

387
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:11,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it wasn't that long ago.

388
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:19,912
[SPEAKER_05]: and TigerClaw says the premise of Tokyo Jungle is similar to that show on the Discovery Channel called Life After People.

389
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

390
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:52,479
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have to stay out of toxic dumps that could be in the city.

391
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,440
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to stay away from all these things.

392
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:57,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have all these meters that are constantly draining.

393
00:26:57,642 --> 00:26:59,643
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to stay on top of and make sure are full.

394
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:01,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're trying to complete all these micro goals.

395
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe it's eating and then it's marking your territory.

396
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you get to mark your territory in the game.

397
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:13,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's finding a female to mate with and then actually mating with the female.

398
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:31,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, Loki, I died laughing the first time that scene happened because you play us as little Pomeranian and we found the little female Pomeranian and went to the little nest and it goes all the way up to the dog getting up on his hind legs mounting the female Pomeranian before it fades to black.

399
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:35,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no thrust, but there's definitely the assume the position.

400
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was dying.

401
00:27:37,997 --> 00:27:38,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was great.

402
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And that made me laugh a lot.

403
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you basically, you'll start the next generation.

404
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:51,546
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the next generation, you get stats passed down to you based on how you did in the first generation.

405
00:27:51,946 --> 00:27:59,571
[SPEAKER_05]: So the key to maxing out your stats is to continue to mate and get all these stats from having played the game.

406
00:28:00,814 --> 00:28:01,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

407
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,614
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're dead, game over.

408
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:31,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all over.

409
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:34,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like Dark Souls level of unforgiving.

410
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:36,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is kind of awesome, I have to say.

411
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of ramps the pressure up a little bit.

412
00:28:40,908 --> 00:29:06,402
[SPEAKER_05]: but I will say this, there is a way you can get more than one life and it is if you breed and you happen to have like four children you'll run around as a little pack and if one of you dies then another can take over but because you're running around in a pack one of your pack might have to be a decoy and take the hit so you don't take the hit so there's all this crap going on that you kind of have to manage I have to say, it's pretty damn fun

413
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:11,944
[SPEAKER_05]: and you don't really see games like this that are out in America.

414
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, is it a perfect game?

415
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:14,285
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

416
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:16,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it can get a little frustrating.

417
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:17,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it feels a little grindy.

418
00:29:18,546 --> 00:29:33,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really irritated with the way that you can only save after you breed because it might take you a good 15 minutes to get from one life cycle to another and sometimes I have to quit and save right now and if I don't save properly, my game's gone, basically.

419
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:35,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do anything about that.

420
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:36,993
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

421
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:51,930
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

422
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:29,567
[SPEAKER_05]: for $12 it's pretty hard to not appreciate that value there's about like I think something like 30 different animals you can play as and then of course there's DLC if you want to play as more animals but there's crazy shit like panda bears and you know there's all this like funny stuff they even had in Japan they actually had it where one of the creatures you get was a salaryman

423
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that happens later on.

424
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:38,645
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt in our chat says, at live.vognetwork.com, a game where I can pee and have sex with everything?

425
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:39,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Sold!

426
00:30:41,059 --> 00:31:08,159
[SPEAKER_05]: uh let's see uh Actdeft says it's Mass Effect with animals not quite because there's really no dialogue and that's kind of the big part about uh Mass Effect um Tigerclaw says when you play as the lions you have to protect the pride pride from rogue lions that are trying to take over yeah that's I mean even when you play as the Pomeranian a beagle might take your ass out in 30 seconds that's how I got killed the first time I'm running around doing my thing and then all of a sudden like a beagle jumps out of nowhere and attacks me and kills me game over

427
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:11,443
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

428
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

429
00:31:36,502 --> 00:31:38,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably be on sale even more in a few months.

430
00:31:38,924 --> 00:31:41,067
[SPEAKER_05]: The weird thing is, nobody's really talking about this game.

431
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,568
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to look up reviews online.

432
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,170
[SPEAKER_05]: I found like three reviews.

433
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:47,214
[SPEAKER_05]: One great, one average, one negative.

434
00:31:48,295 --> 00:31:50,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So this game is very polarizing, I gotta say.

435
00:31:51,258 --> 00:32:13,319
[SPEAKER_05]: but like none of the big sites reviewed it at all and I've hardly read anything about it anywhere so it really sucks that like Sony's like trying this experiment and it might fail due to lack of promotion so I'm just saying everybody I'll use what little podcast we have here if you think you might be interested in this type of game go check out Tokyo Jungle because it's a neat little little gem on the PlayStation Network

436
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:15,557
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

437
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

438
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:03,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Their audio is really good, so I was really happy to take on these microphones.

439
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really want to thank them.

440
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:10,985
[SPEAKER_05]: They are on Monday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, and they have done a lot.

441
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad from PodCulture has done a lot and is very supportive of the projects I've done.

442
00:33:14,988 --> 00:33:16,649
[SPEAKER_05]: He hosts the website for Horde House.

443
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:23,954
[SPEAKER_05]: He did those decals, or I don't think he did them himself, but he arranged the deal for those decals for Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.

444
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:27,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really thankful for all Brad does for the show, so I really want to thank him.

445
00:33:28,036 --> 00:33:28,596
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

446
00:33:56,764 --> 00:34:04,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of pod culture and all of the Monday night shows on the Voice of Geeks Network, it is Doctor Who Monday on the Voice of Geeks Network tomorrow.

447
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:13,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Three shows all talking about Doctor Who, Critical Myth, British Invaders, and pod culture's special TARDIS Interruptus.

448
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:15,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who

449
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:42,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know Critical Myth and Pod Culture, TARDIS Interruptus, both want to kind of take that on a little bit.

450
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:54,903
[SPEAKER_05]: British Invaders, which is sandwiched right between the two shows, back-to-back shows on the Voice Geek Networks tomorrow, taking on classic Doctor Who before the Russell T. Davies era, going back to the 60s and 70s.

451
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:57,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really nice mix of the new and the old tomorrow on VOG.

452
00:34:57,985 --> 00:34:58,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I love.

453
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:02,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that that's what this network's all about, is that everybody's got a common theme going on.

454
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:03,949
[SPEAKER_05]: So, very cool.

455
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:05,390
[SPEAKER_05]: That's tomorrow night.

456
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:14,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Starts at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern with Critical Myth, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern with British Invaders, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern with PodCulture.

457
00:35:14,794 --> 00:35:22,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if you missed Doctor Who night because you're listening on the podcast feed or what have you, do check out these excellent shows another time on the network another Monday.

458
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,459
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do rerun throughout the week as well.

459
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:28,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Also want to plug Umlaut.

460
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:30,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Umlaut season.

461
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you believe it?

462
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:34,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Umlaut is the rock band event for charity.

463
00:35:34,094 --> 00:35:40,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes place at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco every December and the fundraising season is in effect for this year.

464
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:42,161
[SPEAKER_05]: They still need a couple more bands.

465
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:46,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Very surprising they didn't sell out as fast as they did last year because...

466
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,166
[SPEAKER_05]: and Tim Schafer.

467
00:36:02,498 --> 00:36:03,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

468
00:36:30,251 --> 00:36:43,823
[SPEAKER_05]: December 6th, 2012 is the official date at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco Thursday and I bet it's going to be streamed on the internet again just a bet because it was last year so I bet they're going to do it again

469
00:36:45,544 --> 00:37:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: uh one other thing it's a plug i got a lot tonight what can i say uh it is also awards season in the podcast universe podcast awards and stitcher awards two of them this year uh you can nominate for the podcast award one time at podcastawards.com and we really encourage you to nominate orange lounge radio as your best gaming show uh we would also really encourage you to consider other VOG programming and other independent programming in the other categories

470
00:37:13,493 --> 00:37:27,698
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, TV Movie, there's Critical Myth is a great TV movie show, Sci-Fi, Pod Culture, Mature, Under Station Live, and lots of great, great shows on the network to consider for some of these categories.

471
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:31,239
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really encourage you to do that at podcastawards.com.

472
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,181
[SPEAKER_05]: The Stitcher Awards are also having their awards season, and you can check that out.

473
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:42,163
[SPEAKER_05]: The links are available on our Facebook, and I will also place those links in chat a little later.

474
00:37:42,623 --> 00:38:00,973
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can nominate once a day for the Stitcher Awards so if you want to nominate multiple shows like you want to do oh you're like oh my god there's so many gaming shows I love on the VOG Network I want to nominate them all you can do Orange Sounds Radio one day then Bobby Blackwolf the next day then Girls Gone Wild the next day you know you can kind of cycle through and that'll work so that is available at Stitcher.com

475
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:28,000
[SPEAKER_05]: and as I was talking about at the end of Bobby Blackwell's show I really think because the iOS 6 podcasting app has not been super well received Stitcher and all this stuff is really the wave of the future along with TuneIn and other types of iOS excuse me not just iOS but Android and mobile phone apps is really the wave of the future so I really encourage you guys to help us kind of be on that cutting edge with the nomination remember we don't ask for your money for this show all we ask is to help us with the word of mouth

476
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now we can get into gaming news.

477
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:31,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, a lot of announcements tonight.

478
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:31,942
[SPEAKER_05]: What can I say?

479
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:33,242
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

480
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:34,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

481
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:40,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about Cliffy B. He is gone.

482
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,448
[SPEAKER_04]: He decided to leave Epic Games.

483
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,310
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, basically, it makes sense.

484
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,291
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing it since he's been a teenager.

485
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:53,534
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, outside of my sabbatical last year, I've been going nonstop.

486
00:38:54,314 --> 00:39:21,421
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know grew up in this business as um you know he says as Mike Capps likes to say and now that I'm growing up it's much or it's time for a much-needed break so cool I'm not sure who else is going to be kind of taking over for some of that stuff now that he's gone but um it's cool to see him kind of get his break because he's definitely been busy with Gears of War

487
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I've heard a lot of rumors and this is total fanboy wank, but I want to indulge it a little bit at just how wanky this all is.

488
00:39:30,583 --> 00:39:31,924
[SPEAKER_05]: You know which rumor this is, right?

489
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:35,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Like where he went or where he's going, who offered to buy him.

490
00:39:35,565 --> 00:39:36,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you heard this?

491
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:36,626
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

492
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:45,119
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be the craziest fanboy company that people hope hired Cliffy B to show how serious they are?

493
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:50,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Zynga?

494
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

495
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:52,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo.

496
00:39:53,225 --> 00:40:00,149
[SPEAKER_05]: There are rumors online that Cliffy B went to Nintendo, which I... You know, obvious fanboy wank.

497
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to indulge it too much.

498
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:04,072
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't help yourself.

499
00:40:04,212 --> 00:40:06,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Once the seed is planted in your head, you're like...

500
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,716
[SPEAKER_05]: God, Nintendo really should hire someone like him.

501
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:11,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

502
00:40:11,237 --> 00:40:14,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it matters, because... I don't know.

503
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:18,722
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just... I don't know what he would be able to do for them.

504
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully make another franchise, because seriously, they need some new franchises.

505
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:26,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Invent a hardcore franchise?

506
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:30,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with some of the Japanese characterization?

507
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:30,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

508
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm crazy, but...

509
00:40:33,717 --> 00:40:37,819
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had hardcore franchises at one point, I thought.

510
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:39,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

511
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Sin and Punishment?

512
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Sin and Punishment is pretty awesome.

513
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:45,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's that.

514
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,663
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Eternal Darkness.

515
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:53,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But none of that on the Wii U. None of it.

516
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says Cliffy B did get a letter printed in Nintendo Power.

517
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:04,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, apparently a lot of people leeching onto that, like, oh, he's always loved Nintendo.

518
00:41:04,148 --> 00:41:05,009
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd go work for them.

519
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:07,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

520
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:17,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if the reason he's quitting Epic Games was because he feels like he needs a break.

521
00:41:17,913 --> 00:41:20,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he's going to jump right into something else right now.

522
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless he's just making excuses, which is kind of a pussy way of doing it.

523
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:32,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but there's also kind of the right corporate way of doing things, and maybe he's going to take a siesta for a few months until the next E3.

524
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:34,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm leaving because Nintendo said they'll hire me.

525
00:41:34,212 --> 00:41:34,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet!

526
00:41:35,933 --> 00:41:40,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Cliffy being a Nintendo is a real stretch.

527
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't be surprised if he went to Microsoft, though.

528
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:47,301
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little more like, okay, realistic category.

529
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Sony.

530
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I could see that happening, too.

531
00:41:52,392 --> 00:41:52,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

532
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:53,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything's possible.

533
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:54,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything's possible.

534
00:41:54,494 --> 00:41:55,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a crazy world.

535
00:41:55,676 --> 00:41:56,436
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a crazy world.

536
00:41:57,357 --> 00:41:59,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Seg asked a challenging question, though.

537
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,902
[SPEAKER_05]: How would he benefit from going to Nintendo?

538
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:05,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they offered him houses full of money.

539
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:08,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Cliffy B is kind of a rock star.

540
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:09,470
[SPEAKER_05]: We've given you a Nintendo DS.

541
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:12,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It prints money.

542
00:42:14,149 --> 00:42:17,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I don't want to buy into the fanboy wank too much.

543
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:19,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying I personally believe it.

544
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I can definitely see the angle of, shit, you've been doing one thing for 20 years, and maybe you just want to change.

545
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:28,663
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to go design playgrounds.

546
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:32,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Just playgrounds with chainsaws attached to them, that kind of thing.

547
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:38,631
[SPEAKER_05]: But the interesting thing is, the guys at BioWare, the doctors at BioWare, did a very similar thing recently.

548
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:41,353
[SPEAKER_05]: They left the industry after a very long time.

549
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:43,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of don't think they're going to show up anywhere else.

550
00:42:43,254 --> 00:42:44,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, you know what's going on.

551
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:51,160
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to make a game company that's like... Polytron?

552
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you think all these game journalists that left are going to create the League of Super Game Designers and make this company that'll create like...

553
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:00,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Something.

554
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:04,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, yeah, there's that Polygon, which did they ever like officially launch?

555
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gives a fuck?

556
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:06,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously don't care.

557
00:43:07,373 --> 00:43:10,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It is like the most hipster bullshit, you know, company.

558
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:11,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

559
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:12,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're so cool.

560
00:43:12,878 --> 00:43:20,426
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to print articles about, we're going to do a documentary about the creation of our company, our website that's not fucking finished yet.

561
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,549
[SPEAKER_04]: No one cares about your fucking website.

562
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:31,372
[SPEAKER_04]: That, I mean, how fucking, you know, snub-nosed, you know, pompous bullshit is that?

563
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that you're just gonna...

564
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:58,556
[SPEAKER_05]: create a documentary because you know you all want to know how this happened no one fucking cares are you saying now I you know the views and opinions of Loki do not express those Orange Lounge Radio necessarily so what you're saying is you're really interested in that but but yeah I'm gonna say I'm not gonna touch that with a 10-foot pole are you saying that this site has lost itself up its own asshole before it's even launched yes

565
00:43:59,957 --> 00:44:00,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Just checking.

566
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:05,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, SSJ100Mad is asking, do they print out game ads in Whole Foods and Trader Joe's?

567
00:44:05,681 --> 00:44:07,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I don't want this to be a shade-throwing competition.

568
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:09,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we're going to walk away from this.

569
00:44:10,445 --> 00:44:15,128
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's talk about the whole idea of the Super Justice League of game developers.

570
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:20,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So you think maybe Cliffy B, BioWare, you know Zynga lost some people this week too.

571
00:44:21,513 --> 00:44:25,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it could be like the Super League of Mobile Phone Developers?

572
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:27,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

573
00:44:27,118 --> 00:44:27,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

574
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,790
[SPEAKER_04]: What if he went to Apple?

575
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:31,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

576
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:35,855
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

577
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:38,738
[SPEAKER_04]: He would be a pretty cool, like, presenter.

578
00:44:38,938 --> 00:44:44,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because, you know, they need something kind of, you know, with a lot of... Are you saying Tim Cook doesn't have enough energy?

579
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:44,943
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he doesn't.

580
00:44:48,266 --> 00:44:48,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

581
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:54,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, all right, so Cliffy B's leaving, and so we dedicate this to you, Cliffy B.

582
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

583
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:13,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to something.

584
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gone from a very American company to something very Japanese, but a lot of you love it.

585
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:21,333
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix.

586
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:23,675
[SPEAKER_05]: You're rolling your eyes over there, Loki.

587
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:25,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm rolling my eyes at the name.

588
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:27,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, just come up with a better fucking name.

589
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:28,617
[SPEAKER_04]: 1.5 HD Remix.

590
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:30,258
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it 1.5?

591
00:45:30,618 --> 00:45:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you.

592
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad you asked, Loki.

593
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:38,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is how Kingdom Hearts 1 is now Kingdom Hearts 1.5.

594
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:38,982
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

595
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:39,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

596
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:47,248
[SPEAKER_05]: The screen for each game will rearrange to accommodate for widescreen support including the HUD rearrangement.

597
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:49,730
[SPEAKER_05]: No reaction.

598
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:58,017
[SPEAKER_05]: The models for Sora and all his friends have been replaced with ones from Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance, the newest game in the series.

599
00:45:59,594 --> 00:45:59,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

600
00:45:59,894 --> 00:46:00,154
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

601
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:05,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Trophy support for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.

602
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:06,819
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

603
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:07,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing?

604
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were an achievement whore.

605
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

606
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:15,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Game mechanics have been updated to make the gameplay feel more like Kingdom Hearts 2.

607
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:20,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, in all reality, that could be a good thing if they fix the camera from the first game.

608
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:25,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that's the hidden message in there without them wanting to admit that the first game had a board camera.

609
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to admit, that's a little better, right?

610
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:29,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

611
00:46:29,315 --> 00:46:30,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a nice addition, I guess.

612
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:31,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

613
00:46:31,536 --> 00:46:32,077
[SPEAKER_05]: We got something.

614
00:46:33,777 --> 00:46:41,301
[SPEAKER_05]: 70% of the story from 358 slash 2 days will be represented with over 100 new scenes created with full voice acting.

615
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:44,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh!

616
00:46:44,563 --> 00:46:47,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that an admission from Loki that there might be something worthwhile here?

617
00:46:47,325 --> 00:46:52,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's all cutscenes from another game because they didn't want to actually port over 358 slash 2 or whatever.

618
00:46:54,068 --> 00:47:08,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm so glad you said something about that because Tetsuya Nomura said he originally wanted to do a full remake of the 358 slash two days, but he didn't have enough time in production to start a project, thus the decision to utilize theater mode to tell the story.

619
00:47:09,103 --> 00:47:09,703
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of lame.

620
00:47:10,444 --> 00:47:11,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Ran out of time?

621
00:47:11,823 --> 00:47:12,303
[SPEAKER_04]: That's lame.

622
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:13,604
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an excuse.

623
00:47:13,824 --> 00:47:15,565
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just easier to update everything.

624
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:22,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, he was asked in this interview with Famitsu, would Kingdom Hearts 2 get the same treatment?

625
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:27,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And the response was a laugh and, quote, it'd be unusual if there wasn't.

626
00:47:28,732 --> 00:47:30,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've already decided that we're doing that.

627
00:47:32,094 --> 00:47:35,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I bet a lot of it is how well does this first one sell?

628
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:39,420
[SPEAKER_05]: If this one sells like crazy, then sure, that's a logical conclusion to get to.

629
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then they'll do the PSP games on top of it for the next one.

630
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vita?

631
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:44,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

632
00:47:45,324 --> 00:47:56,193
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they'll do the PSP games up-res because just like they did with... Remember, Sony is already on the record saying that they've got a wonderful engine that can port PSP stuff into HD for the PS3, so why not?

633
00:47:58,654 --> 00:48:27,170
[SPEAKER_05]: another quote along the same lines of this whole does this mean there's a 2.5 quote and from Tetsuya Nomura quote I figured there were people who had a hard time keeping up with the sequels we had to start from the beginning with Kingdom Hearts HD I also thought that familiar fans might make new discoveries seeing everything in chronological order with the sequels side by side I'm happy to be restarting this title I don't think it's a problem that people necessarily have problems keeping up with the sequels it's that people can't keep up with the fucking story like

634
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:31,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't Kingdom Hearts supposed to be aimed at kids?

635
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:35,218
[SPEAKER_05]: The story is crazy convoluted.

636
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:36,620
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even understand it.

637
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,322
[SPEAKER_05]: It's worse than As the World Turns.

638
00:48:41,164 --> 00:48:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

639
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:49,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in chat asks, how can you remake something that isn't that old?

640
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:53,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's getting there, though.

641
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,016
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time this is actually out, 2013 would be about the time frame this is out, right?

642
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:02,241
[SPEAKER_05]: The first Kingdom Hearts game was, what, 2003, maybe?

643
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:03,122
[SPEAKER_05]: About 10 years?

644
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:04,905
[SPEAKER_05]: 9 years, maybe?

645
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:07,127
[SPEAKER_04]: They remade God of War.

646
00:49:07,908 --> 00:49:09,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Or rolled up Resident.

647
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:17,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Techness in chat says Square Enix is kind of like the honey badger of Japanese developers.

648
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:20,364
[SPEAKER_05]: They just don't give a fuck and just do whatever they feel like doing today.

649
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:25,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan Alchemy says you can't argue you have no fucking idea what's going on anymore.

650
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:25,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Here comes a sequel.

651
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:47,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good idea to have these re-releases because it's most likely ramping up to a Kingdom Hearts 3 or something like that so they're going to put these re-releases out there so people kind of have an idea what the fuck's going on let the hype train begin and get back into it and then go from there well we will see what happens I love this other comment from Alan Alchemy P.S.

652
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:53,147
[SPEAKER_05]: we made figuring out what the fuck was going on very very hard we know haters make us famous

653
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:55,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

654
00:49:56,138 --> 00:49:57,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Haters make us famous.

655
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.

656
00:49:59,461 --> 00:49:59,741
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

657
00:50:00,182 --> 00:50:04,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a new service that's going to be coming out from Microsoft, Xbox Music.

658
00:50:05,026 --> 00:50:13,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be coming this month and actually launching, I guess, alongside Windows 8, which I'm surprised that so soon.

659
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's October 26th.

660
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:16,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares about Windows 8?

661
00:50:16,857 --> 00:50:17,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Go see Silent Hill.

662
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:19,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course...

663
00:50:21,741 --> 00:50:23,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds very similar to Pandora.

664
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:33,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's going to be ad-supported, and you'll be able to also use Windows 8, Xbox 360, Windows Phone.

665
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:42,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to tie into Microsoft SkyDrive, and I guess allow you to sync your playlists and music libraries across all the devices and stuff.

666
00:50:43,993 --> 00:50:44,133
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

667
00:50:46,744 --> 00:50:47,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

668
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:48,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

669
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:52,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm glad it's free because, you know, I don't want to have to pay for stuff.

670
00:50:53,246 --> 00:50:54,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Ad support is fine.

671
00:50:55,067 --> 00:51:05,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Free is good, but I think, you know, because you're talking about Pandora and there's all these other services Xbox already offers that Xbox Music has to be better than that are also free.

672
00:51:05,351 --> 00:51:11,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Last.fm is available on the 360. iHeartRadio, which is kind of Clear Channel's little Pandora-esque theme.

673
00:51:11,793 --> 00:51:14,714
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can actually listen to over-the-air radio stations with it too.

674
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:16,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on Xbox 360.

675
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:20,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's logical that they have to kind of put something out free.

676
00:51:20,257 --> 00:51:25,719
[SPEAKER_05]: The subscription model for music isn't really working anymore, which is why I think Apple never ended up doing it.

677
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:27,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet.

678
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Although maybe Apple can kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies can't.

679
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:34,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

680
00:51:36,408 --> 00:51:38,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll check out Xbox Music.

681
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:40,111
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep forgetting there is a dashboard update.

682
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:41,331
[SPEAKER_05]: We're due for one, aren't we?

683
00:51:41,952 --> 00:51:43,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably either at the end.

684
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:44,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to guess at the end of this month.

685
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:52,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it out there so that they can start banning people before Modern Warfare, or not Modern Warfare.

686
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:53,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep wanting to call it Modern Warfare 3.

687
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,021
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Black Ops 2 comes out.

688
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:56,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 4.

689
00:51:57,602 --> 00:52:01,265
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to get those extra security checks in there before all those big games.

690
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:01,845
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.

691
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,166
[SPEAKER_05]: When is Halo 4's release?

692
00:52:03,406 --> 00:52:07,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 4 is the 6th and Black Ops 2 is the 13th of November.

693
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:08,449
[SPEAKER_05]: November.

694
00:52:08,689 --> 00:52:08,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

695
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:09,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that makes sense.

696
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,672
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in October now, so it'll be like just before Halo 4 maybe.

697
00:52:13,692 --> 00:52:14,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of games.

698
00:52:15,213 --> 00:52:15,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

699
00:52:15,814 --> 00:52:17,275
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get to the release date soon enough.

700
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, something else on the Xbox 360.

701
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: One company is claiming that they are going to be soon heard on the Xbox 360 and seen.

702
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the site YouPorn.

703
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:29,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Never heard of this site.

704
00:52:29,782 --> 00:52:30,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you believe that?

705
00:52:30,382 --> 00:52:31,723
[SPEAKER_05]: A pornography site I haven't heard of.

706
00:52:31,803 --> 00:52:32,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It's YouPorn.

707
00:52:32,103 --> 00:52:32,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of it.

708
00:52:33,244 --> 00:52:33,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

709
00:52:33,924 --> 00:52:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the app on my boxy box.

710
00:52:38,265 --> 00:52:40,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see some boxy box on your boxy box?

711
00:52:41,106 --> 00:52:42,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they don't ever use it because it's terrible.

712
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's one of the... I mean, come on.

713
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:52,669
[SPEAKER_04]: The boxy box had all these different repositories that you can get and a lot of them were porn.

714
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:57,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to download all the porn ones that were free because I'm not paying for fucking porn.

715
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Not doing it.

716
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:00,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

717
00:53:01,331 --> 00:53:01,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we checked it out.

718
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:03,233
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just links to their website.

719
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks exactly the same as the other ones.

720
00:53:05,714 --> 00:53:08,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a streaming website for porn.

721
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:13,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the name implies the YouTube of porn, sort of.

722
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they posted an entry to their blog.

723
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:17,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

724
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:19,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh.

725
00:53:19,143 --> 00:53:20,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I've got to read this from chat.

726
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Alpha Cananagram in our chat room.

727
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:27,950
[SPEAKER_05]: at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, I remember y'all talking about you porn on Guys on a Show.

728
00:53:28,411 --> 00:53:33,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure that was the site y'all went to for, quote, Japanese fart girl.

729
00:53:34,451 --> 00:53:35,912
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you remember that?

730
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:37,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

731
00:53:37,192 --> 00:53:40,133
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember things about my life I don't remember.

732
00:53:40,453 --> 00:53:46,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And YouPorn was also the website that we visited on your Wii using the Wii web browser to find pterodactyl porn.

733
00:53:46,836 --> 00:53:48,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was PornTube.

734
00:53:48,657 --> 00:53:49,757
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all the fucking same.

735
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:50,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

736
00:53:51,218 --> 00:53:52,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of those.

737
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:53,138
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

738
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:56,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyhow, here's the quote from YouPorn's blog.

739
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamers and free porn lovers around the world rejoice.

740
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:01,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

741
00:54:02,162 --> 00:54:05,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks at long last to the introduction of Internet Explorer for Xbox.

742
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:11,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You can now tap into and stream all your favorite free YouPorn videos right from your Xbox.

743
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:25,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you're pwning noobs in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, annihilating Bullymong in Borderlands 2, or taking the Saints deep in Madam NFL 13, you're never more than a few simple controller clicks away from being face deep in hot free porn.

744
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:31,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because we all have the internet, so it's no big deal.

745
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:32,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

746
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:37,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So all they're really saying is, we can't wait for Internet Explorer on the Xbox 360.

747
00:54:37,469 --> 00:54:40,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Who says it's going to fucking work with your website anyways?

748
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:41,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's Internet Explorer!

749
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:45,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, that's not guaranteed to work with anything.

750
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:49,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would hope that's HTML5, but I mean, come on.

751
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:52,393
[SPEAKER_04]: We know better than, you know, all these...

752
00:54:53,934 --> 00:54:57,758
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, different web browsers for stuff don't necessarily work with the porn sites.

753
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:00,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, granted, the PlayStation 3 browser works well with porn sites.

754
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,443
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii browser works well with porn sites.

755
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it is... They kind of have to at this point.

756
00:55:06,187 --> 00:55:06,488
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yes.

757
00:55:06,948 --> 00:55:10,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that news, though, VOG Network is also on your Xbox 360 because...

758
00:55:11,713 --> 00:55:13,914
[SPEAKER_04]: It's HTML5, so it should work.

759
00:55:14,254 --> 00:55:17,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming that Internet Explorer 8 works with HTML5.

760
00:55:17,395 --> 00:55:20,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to be able to code a website to show up like an Xbox channel?

761
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:22,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not 8, 10.

762
00:55:23,877 --> 00:55:25,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe, I don't know about that.

763
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:28,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we should make a VOG channel if that's possible.

764
00:55:28,398 --> 00:55:28,758
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway.

765
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it works that way.

766
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:33,600
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll happen as soon as the new OLR PSP debuts.

767
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:37,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, except the PSP's over.

768
00:55:38,578 --> 00:55:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Bobby in chat says it does not stream on the Xbox 360 Internet Explorer.

769
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried.

770
00:55:43,566 --> 00:55:45,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess he's in some developer thing.

771
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: He has the XNA thing, so yeah.

772
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:49,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make it work.

773
00:55:51,597 --> 00:55:57,082
[SPEAKER_05]: The official response from Microsoft, who are quick to distance themselves from this.

774
00:55:58,062 --> 00:56:07,590
[SPEAKER_05]: To be clear, we are adding Internet Explorer to Xbox Live, not specific adult content providers like YouPorn or any other specific website content.

775
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:13,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, we give members and parents the option to turn this feature on or off for their accounts.

776
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:18,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Access to Internet Explorer for all child accounts is blocked by default.

777
00:56:19,219 --> 00:56:23,783
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to get far away from a scandal ASAP And who can blame them?

778
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:42,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Because honestly, you know, if Fox News got a hold of this little spiel here Oh, they've done it with every single console that has a stupid web browser Exactly, and they'd have a It's a porn box, oh, Xbox, triple Xbox I think they've already done that before They'd have a pornography expert on with commentating, you know, whatever

779
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:49,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've already done that too before with the Windows Media Center streaming or something like that.

780
00:56:49,816 --> 00:56:57,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you used to build these Windows Media Center to view what's on your computer and stream Internet Explorer or Firefox or something like that.

781
00:56:58,564 --> 00:57:06,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Good lord, Jason in chat says, not to beat a dead horse, but Rob mentioned you porn in an unprotected six, too, I thought, referencing my old, old YouTube project.

782
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,950
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

783
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:12,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear I have not heard of you porn, although I'm old and I forget things, so whatever.

784
00:57:13,074 --> 00:57:18,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Some folks in chat, I think, kind of wondering if maybe the Kinect would allow you to make your own porn and you could upload it.

785
00:57:18,638 --> 00:57:19,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Internet Explorer will allow you to do that.

786
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:20,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That would look terrible.

787
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:21,780
[SPEAKER_05]: That camera is not good.

788
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:36,120
[SPEAKER_05]: all right Frisbee in chat says I'm an internet expert and I just found out that boobies are online maybe I'm doing the show topless right now

789
00:57:37,897 --> 00:57:38,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki.

790
00:57:41,582 --> 00:57:43,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, porn, porn, porn.

791
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:45,366
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet is for porn.

792
00:57:45,386 --> 00:57:46,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

793
00:57:46,227 --> 00:57:47,809
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet is for porn.

794
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:53,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So, apparently there are cheating allegations in the League of Legends...

795
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Playoffs.

796
00:57:56,418 --> 00:58:01,220
[SPEAKER_04]: First you tell me there's boobs on the internet and now you're going to tell me there's cheating?

797
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:01,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I know!

798
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the fuck out!

799
00:58:03,821 --> 00:58:07,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the most ridiculous part of the whole thing is that

800
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:10,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

801
00:58:27,644 --> 00:58:33,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, one of the referees said, we keep a constant watch on all the players on stage at all times.

802
00:58:34,272 --> 00:58:38,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We have cameras as well as live people walking on stage to keep tabs on everything.

803
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:44,864
[SPEAKER_04]: All players are told that they need to remain sitting facing forward with headphones on at all times, including during pauses.

804
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:53,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I can confirm that no WE player looked at the minimap at any point during the match.

805
00:58:54,878 --> 00:58:57,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Although they have a screenshot showing otherwise.

806
00:58:57,462 --> 00:58:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

807
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:00,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

808
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:03,473
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's my thing.

809
00:59:03,493 --> 00:59:17,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you're going to set up a tournament like that, and I didn't watch it live, so I don't know how exactly they're set up, but wouldn't you think that you would put the players in a way that they wouldn't be able to see the mini-map showing the other team?

810
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:18,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a thought?

811
00:59:18,743 --> 00:59:29,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe so that they can't look at the other team's screen, or they can't look at something that's being broadcast on a giant screen in an arena, wherever the fuck this is.

812
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:35,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So, don't give them the opportunity, then you don't have to worry about them fucking, you know, cheating.

813
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:40,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Little mirrors on the side of my glasses allow me to see behind me and around me.

814
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:41,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, it's just...

815
00:59:44,079 --> 01:00:13,304
[SPEAKER_04]: it's stupid but it's for two million dollars so of course some people are going to try to you know whatever they can do and and there was um you know they were talking a little bit about you know what kind of made them suspect stuff like uh ended up where one team was I guess pinging a spot in the map or whatever where um the other team was and basically there was no way for them to have known that those guys were there but they knew that the players were coming from that direction or something like that so it's like wait a second that's a little weird

816
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:19,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what if it's just that, you know, maybe you kind of read up on the competition and maybe you know their strategies and stuff.

817
01:00:19,128 --> 01:00:27,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I know those might be kind of a stretch here, but what if, you know, they just kind of, you know, that's where they wanted to investigate and it was just a coincidence.

818
01:00:28,274 --> 01:00:29,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe I'm giving it too much credit.

819
01:00:29,915 --> 01:00:31,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest, but I don't know.

820
01:00:32,036 --> 01:00:32,857
[SPEAKER_05]: It could happen.

821
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:34,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have to look at both sides.

822
01:00:35,438 --> 01:00:37,980
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to just automatically assume everybody's a cheater.

823
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because here's one of the comments.

824
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:51,848
[SPEAKER_04]: They said Azubu Frost did the same thing, only they paused the game, checked the map, and saw that the enemy team was going to ambush them, trying to counter the tactic that Azubu used in the past.

825
01:00:51,948 --> 01:01:01,373
[SPEAKER_04]: With the pause, Azubu managed to mysteriously ping the exact brush TSM was in at the same time they were there, just after the pause.

826
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:02,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Coincidentally.

827
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:05,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it sounds like that they were

828
01:01:07,273 --> 01:01:09,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, a little funny business is going on.

829
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:10,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

830
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:17,760
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, you know, okay, apparently what it was is the map was being projected behind the players, you know, so people can see it.

831
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:25,525
[SPEAKER_04]: But put a fucking screen or something, you know, put that in a projection screen that's in front of the team.

832
01:01:25,545 --> 01:01:28,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, because you can maybe see the reflection in the monitor or something.

833
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:29,408
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be very easy.

834
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:36,533
[SPEAKER_04]: It just, come on, you're running a $2 million tournament and you can't have decent, you're going to go that,

835
01:01:38,274 --> 01:02:05,087
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that ghetto cheap on that stuff to where oh well you know people even in regular tournaments that run well people are going to accuse other people of cheating just don't give them the opportunity especially when this much money is on the line sometimes you don't think of everything I don't know on Horde House this week we talked about a guild Warcraft contest that went a little wrong because you know they didn't think about every possible thing that could happen

836
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:17,890
[SPEAKER_04]: not to mention that they also I think there was an issue where someone was DOSing the servers they were trying to use for oh great for something so they moved to like some different servers or something I don't know

837
01:02:20,123 --> 01:02:21,204
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, let's move on.

838
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Something completely different.

839
01:02:22,924 --> 01:02:25,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Something you can play with online to make your own chiptune music.

840
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:40,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I like little creative sites like this, and this is pretty cool because this website kind of looks like a Game Boy, and you can sequence your own tones, play them back, and save things to a WAV file so you can make your own cool little chiptunes.

841
01:02:40,649 --> 01:02:42,150
[SPEAKER_05]: It is called Pulse Boy.

842
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:46,631
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to check it out, it's pulseboy.com, and I think it's called that because it looks like a Game Boy.

843
01:02:47,171 --> 01:02:48,632
[SPEAKER_05]: It was made by Roger Hicks.

844
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:55,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you feel like kind of just messing around making your own chip, excuse me, your own chiptune songs, you can check out that website.

845
01:02:56,727 --> 01:02:58,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what else to say about it, but it looks pretty cool.

846
01:02:58,929 --> 01:03:06,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had time to play with it myself yet, but I like those music-making types of programs, especially since there hasn't been a new Mario Paint.

847
01:03:07,035 --> 01:03:07,855
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a crime.

848
01:03:07,875 --> 01:03:08,356
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a crime.

849
01:03:08,376 --> 01:03:11,518
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to have that with a tablet controller.

850
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:12,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

851
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:12,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

852
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:14,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Still no Mario Paint, but now they have Art Academy.

853
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:15,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why.

854
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:16,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Art Academy now.

855
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:17,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

856
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:19,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario Paint.

857
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:21,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want Art Academy.

858
01:03:21,526 --> 01:03:22,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Mario Paint.

859
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:24,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides, there's GarageBand.

860
01:03:26,305 --> 01:03:26,865
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

861
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:55,130
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that are coming out soon near you.

862
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:58,652
[SPEAKER_04]: This week is actually quite a bit because we're getting into the fall stuff.

863
01:03:59,052 --> 01:04:05,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, today, Pokemon Black Version 2 and Pokemon White Version 2 out on the Nintendo DS.

864
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:12,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Naughty Bear Double Trouble for the PlayStation 3 includes a Naughty Bear Gold Edition and Naughty Bear Trouble in Paradise.

865
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Both, I'm sure, very underwhelming.

866
01:04:15,461 --> 01:04:17,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love Naughty Bear, said nobody ever.

867
01:04:19,045 --> 01:04:19,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

868
01:04:20,347 --> 01:04:21,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We played the original.

869
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:21,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It was terrible.

870
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Spy Hunters coming back on the Vita and 3DS.

871
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:31,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance 4 out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.

872
01:04:31,959 --> 01:04:33,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Ball Z for Kinect.

873
01:04:34,362 --> 01:04:35,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you can be over 9,000.

874
01:04:38,026 --> 01:04:39,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Code of Princess for the 3DS.

875
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:53,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Harry Potter for Kinect, Monster 4x4 for the 3DS, the cool game this week, Dishonored on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

876
01:04:54,636 --> 01:05:00,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And, let's see, XCOM, Enemy Unknown on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

877
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:04,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe that series is coming back, and it's probably going to look nothing like the original.

878
01:05:06,064 --> 01:05:20,880
[SPEAKER_04]: the new one well this is the strategy one so they don't have the third person shooter one yet and then Fable the Journey on Xbox 360 for Kinect and god I wonder if that sucks or not haven't seen any reviews for that yet but that's it

879
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:25,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well traveling to Japan, some of the same stuff on the Xbox 360 over there.

880
01:05:25,304 --> 01:05:29,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Dishonored comes out on the 360 October 11th, as well as Fable the Journey.

881
01:05:30,508 --> 01:05:36,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Something must be going on with Rocksmith because there's a new cable and a cable bundle that are coming out in Japan as well.

882
01:05:37,073 --> 01:05:39,215
[SPEAKER_05]: So Rocksmith must be landing in Japan.

883
01:05:39,775 --> 01:05:41,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Either it already has or it's landing there soon.

884
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:43,238
[SPEAKER_05]: on the PlayStation 3.

885
01:05:44,299 --> 01:05:46,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much all the same stuff I just named.

886
01:05:46,962 --> 01:05:48,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, just Dishonored and the Rocksmith thing.

887
01:05:49,024 --> 01:05:50,205
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one isn't happening.

888
01:05:50,525 --> 01:05:56,451
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also have Toki Toa comes out as well in a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack.

889
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:57,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting.

890
01:05:58,493 --> 01:05:59,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, I don't know what this is.

891
01:05:59,674 --> 01:06:05,019
[SPEAKER_05]: This is some type of like... A wedding is supposed to be a joyous occasion for Princess Toki and her knight.

892
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:08,302
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the sneaky witch predicts that somebody is going to die at her wedding.

893
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:09,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's kind of a downer, isn't it?

894
01:06:10,945 --> 01:06:13,207
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to... God, this is kind of fucked up.

895
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:15,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like it could be kind of a neat concept, actually.

896
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:36,594
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PlayStation Vita, nothing this week, but you do have FIFA 13 to look forward to on the 18th.

897
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:58,875
[SPEAKER_05]: and going to the 3DS real quick.

898
01:06:59,675 --> 01:07:01,216
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a few things, quite a few things.

899
01:07:01,556 --> 01:07:07,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Project X Zone, a Nintendo 3DS LL in blue and black, which I believe is the XL.

900
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:11,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Bravely Default Flying Fairy from Square Enix.

901
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,122
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea what that could be, but there you go.

902
01:07:14,702 --> 01:07:16,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And game of the week for many people, I'm sure.

903
01:07:17,224 --> 01:07:25,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello Kitty, Toeiso, Block Crash Z. That means like Hello Kitty's like the Kool-Aid man crashing through some blocks.

904
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's what that's all about.

905
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:27,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That's on the 3D.

906
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:56,364
[SPEAKER_05]: still no mouth yes on the 3DS going to the European release dates since DarkSakura is not here I'll try to jump in there and check out the European release dates on October the 12th Dishonored on the 360, Playstation 3 and PC, Fable the Journey on the Xbox 360, Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 on October 12th Rocksmith on the 360 and Playstation 3 is that the initial release of the game there?

907
01:07:56,724 --> 01:07:57,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they didn't have it before.

908
01:07:58,906 --> 01:08:08,354
[SPEAKER_05]: WRC3 on the Vita, PlayStation 3, PC, and 360, and XCOM Enemy Unknown across the 360, PS3, and PC.

909
01:08:08,394 --> 01:08:12,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of the same stuff in Europe that we're getting here, so they don't have to wait for a lot of that.

910
01:08:13,178 --> 01:08:16,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

911
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to add one more thing, though.

912
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some news this week that was pretty awesome.

913
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:20,983
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

914
01:08:21,824 --> 01:08:26,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my rep over at D3 knows I'm a huge Earth Defense Force fan.

915
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:32,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan on the 27th of September.

916
01:08:33,272 --> 01:08:39,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Being localized, coming out over here February 12th as Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable.

917
01:08:40,436 --> 01:08:40,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yes.

918
01:08:41,237 --> 01:08:42,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooray, you're happy.

919
01:08:43,278 --> 01:08:44,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to import it!

920
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,385
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew there was a cult enough fandom for it here, right?

921
01:08:49,565 --> 01:08:50,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

922
01:08:50,887 --> 01:08:52,549
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not the only one that loves this series.

923
01:08:52,689 --> 01:08:53,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait.

924
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And Earth Defense Force 4 hopefully is right around the corner.

925
01:08:55,512 --> 01:08:57,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That I may import depending on how long it takes to get over here.

926
01:08:58,215 --> 01:09:02,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to throw something out here too that was not in the news otherwise.

927
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is that it's confirmed that there's more DLC coming for Mass Effect for multiplayer.

928
01:09:08,226 --> 01:09:10,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like one of the most robust ones they've done yet.

929
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:14,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I guess there's going to be overall 16 new classes, which seems crazy to me.

930
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:16,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're rolling it out slowly or something.

931
01:09:16,575 --> 01:09:18,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's only four to start and then there'll be more.

932
01:09:19,678 --> 01:09:45,440
[SPEAKER_05]: but new maps it's some of the older maps with weather effects now and the weather will impact some things but one of the biggest things that really surprised me a fourth enemy race which is really cool and what the game could really use some of so you have the Geth you have the Cerberus you have the Reapers and now you're going to have the Collectors which was a big part of Mass Effect 2 that's coming back so that's awesome

933
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:49,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we have a date for that yet, do we?

934
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:51,861
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe we do.

935
01:09:51,902 --> 01:09:53,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be as soon as this Tuesday, actually.

936
01:09:54,004 --> 01:09:55,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's coming out really soon.

937
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:58,088
[SPEAKER_05]: BioWare tends to announce these things and it's like, by the way, next week.

938
01:09:59,997 --> 01:10:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, so this is very sad, apparently Sony is suing the fictional character Kevin Butler And by suing the fictional character, actually suing the actor that plays him, Jerry Lambert And apparently this is also, I think this has to do with their new commercial they're in for Bridgestone Because they're also suing them as well

939
01:10:23,714 --> 01:10:32,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, basically, uh, he was playing, I guess, a competitor, he was playing Mario Kart on the Wii, um, for that commercial.

940
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:39,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, apparently, I guess, later on, they edited the commercial and removed him from it entirely, which is kind of weird.

941
01:10:40,146 --> 01:10:47,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I guess, um, perhaps, maybe, there's some sort of clause or something that he couldn't be seen, um,

942
01:10:50,779 --> 01:11:03,807
[SPEAKER_04]: They said the use of the Kevin Butler character to sell products other than those from PlayStation misappropriates Sony's intellectual property and creates confusion in the market and causes damage to Sony.

943
01:11:05,048 --> 01:11:06,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't think he was...

944
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:14,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was actually, he wasn't playing Kevin Butler in the commercial.

945
01:11:14,412 --> 01:11:15,212
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just an actor.

946
01:11:15,593 --> 01:11:22,435
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't sue because he's playing a different character that happens to be playing a video game or something like that.

947
01:11:22,595 --> 01:11:25,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like he's like, I'm Kevin Butler with Sony, I'm playing Mario Kart, you know?

948
01:11:25,896 --> 01:11:27,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, he didn't do that.

949
01:11:27,477 --> 01:11:41,948
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, people did notice it was him, and I'm sure there's a lot of people doing a double take, but it's like, actors have to work, and they have to take whatever jobs are offered to them, and if Sony cut him loose, then he should be free to look for other work elsewhere, playing other characters.

950
01:11:42,028 --> 01:11:47,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, he can't not play a manager for the rest of his life, because people might think it's the Sony guy.

951
01:11:48,433 --> 01:11:50,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't know, that seems a little messed up to me.

952
01:11:50,575 --> 01:11:54,158
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people usually know enough to know, like, oh, it's the same guy.

953
01:11:54,178 --> 01:11:54,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

954
01:11:54,898 --> 01:12:21,549
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe it's because Sony was trying to push so hard that Kevin Butler was like a real thing when they brought him out of the press conference a few years ago and so forth at E3 like maybe that's more what they're worried about but that's kind of Sony that built that up right yeah it's weird though because I mean it at no point from what I remember um at no point in that commercial did they ever refer to him as Kevin or refer to him as like anything um

955
01:12:23,098 --> 01:12:25,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just, it's weird.

956
01:12:26,939 --> 01:12:30,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, most people know how to differentiate actors from one project to another.

957
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:34,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, just because somebody plays a villain in one movie doesn't mean they're, like, always a villain.

958
01:12:34,281 --> 01:12:36,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, I guess some people get, you know, typecast.

959
01:12:36,422 --> 01:12:38,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Daniel Radcliffe is not fucking Harry Potter.

960
01:12:38,362 --> 01:12:39,503
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you're right, exactly.

961
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:43,344
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not Harry... That's why he did that play with the nudie stuff, is he wanted to do...

962
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:46,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Women in Black is not Harry Potter and the Women in Black.

963
01:12:46,587 --> 01:12:49,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a totally different movie.

964
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:54,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because this guy is in a commercial doesn't mean it's fucking Kevin Butler.

965
01:12:54,736 --> 01:12:56,317
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my problem.

966
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:57,959
[SPEAKER_04]: How can they even sue over this?

967
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,523
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do whatever they want because they're Sony and they can bully whatever they want.

968
01:13:01,803 --> 01:13:02,323
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

969
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, she's an actress, okay?

970
01:13:31,105 --> 01:13:36,466
[SPEAKER_05]: She had to take on a role of a person not a lot of people really care for, you know?

971
01:13:37,786 --> 01:13:39,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Let her be other parts in other movies.

972
01:13:40,287 --> 01:13:47,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, when I watched Battlestar Galactica, I didn't go, oh, Selina's dad is a spaceship captain now.

973
01:13:48,809 --> 01:13:52,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that the teacher from Stand and Deliver?

974
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:55,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow.

975
01:13:57,884 --> 01:14:07,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Chiggers asks, can that guy ever do another commercial without thinking of him being Kevin Butler?

976
01:14:07,497 --> 01:14:09,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess Loki gave a good example.

977
01:14:09,059 --> 01:14:11,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you ever think of Daniel Radcliffe as anything but Harry Potter?

978
01:14:14,207 --> 01:14:20,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just really quickly, I was trying to watch the commercial real quick to see if he's got a name tag or if they refer to him as... Actually, I'm going to do this real quick.

979
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:56,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna see well let me read some other comments while you're working there Frisbee in chat says anyone who thinks Mario Kart is a Sony product those people are crazy yo Dungeon Buster says it was funny seeing him push the Wii in the commercial though Dungeon Buster says the only thing I could think of was it's nice to see Kevin Butler having fun with the Wii damn I need new tires

980
01:14:57,516 --> 01:14:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Success.

981
01:14:58,437 --> 01:14:59,558
[SPEAKER_05]: The commercial was a success.

982
01:14:59,618 --> 01:15:04,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It got you to think about tires and that you might need to take a trip to the tire store.

983
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:12,347
[SPEAKER_05]: SJ100Matt says, All I have to say is no one cares about the dude you got a Dell guy anymore.

984
01:15:14,388 --> 01:15:19,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they don't really even refer to him at all by any name at all.

985
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just he's playing a character.

986
01:15:21,774 --> 01:15:23,495
[SPEAKER_04]: So this whole lawsuit is fucking retarded.

987
01:15:26,204 --> 01:15:53,980
[SPEAKER_04]: and I feel bad after all the good shit I mean he was he was like a spokesperson for you know Sony that actually kind of got people excited about Sony stuff and here's the way they go and treat him yeah thanks Sony's had a lot of missteps in their advertising over the years and Kevin Butler was one of the things they did right and then they end it they end it and then they go they go they end it and then take a giant dump on it hey we're gonna fucking sue you because you're in a commercial for Bridgestone playing a Wii it's like dude

988
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:58,003
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the one that fucking let him go, you stupid idiot.

989
01:15:58,103 --> 01:16:02,725
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have been still pitching, you know, Sony stuff, but you said, eh, fuck it, we're getting rid of him.

990
01:16:02,945 --> 01:16:09,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room says, actors generally have non- He's the voice of realism here.

991
01:16:10,268 --> 01:16:18,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Actors generally have non-compete clauses about not directly or indirectly promoting a competing product when they do ad work for a certain time.

992
01:16:19,072 --> 01:16:24,595
[SPEAKER_05]: He might have violated his non-compete clause, which was in the contract that his agent should have known, but not him.

993
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:28,997
[SPEAKER_05]: But technically, I mean, just play devil's advocate, technically it was for the tire shop.

994
01:16:29,258 --> 01:16:31,419
[SPEAKER_05]: The ad was not for a Wii, it was for the tire shop.

995
01:16:32,439 --> 01:16:35,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where things get a little fuzzy-wuzzy here.

996
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:40,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, what if he's... What if this Kevin Butler... I keep calling him Kevin Butler.

997
01:16:40,144 --> 01:16:41,265
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fucking Kevin Butler.

998
01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:42,466
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an actual person.

999
01:16:42,886 --> 01:16:55,775
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but what if, for example, you know, they... He walks past, you know... What if Jerry Lambert walks past, like, an Xbox 360 or something that happens to be on?

1000
01:16:55,815 --> 01:16:57,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go, oh, whoa, hold on.

1001
01:16:58,457 --> 01:17:00,619
[SPEAKER_04]: You were too close to another console.

1002
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:01,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to sue you.

1003
01:17:01,579 --> 01:17:02,100
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this...

1004
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:26,063
[SPEAKER_05]: what if he gets a sitcom role or something like that and his kids are playing a fucking Xbox 360 or something what Bobby's saying in chat though does make sense I mean like okay for example Catherine Zeta-Jones was T-Mobile for how many years right like she was the reason a lot of people went to T-Mobile she was a great spokesperson for that company why they ever let her go I'll never know but like it's not like she started doing commercials for AT&T right after that you know

1005
01:17:29,531 --> 01:17:39,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, but at the same time, if she's talking on an iPhone in a movie, can T-Mobile sue her because they don't have the iPhone?

1006
01:17:40,453 --> 01:17:42,114
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be stretching it a little bit, right?

1007
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:44,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's ridiculous.

1008
01:17:45,334 --> 01:17:48,855
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, if there's anything out of it, they're going to try to settle out of court.

1009
01:17:49,115 --> 01:17:52,076
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

1010
01:17:52,776 --> 01:17:53,336
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid.

1011
01:17:54,192 --> 01:17:54,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet Coden 1 and 2

1012
01:18:09,192 --> 01:18:10,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Great PlayStation role-playing games.

1013
01:18:10,893 --> 01:18:15,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, there were five of them, but a lot of people remember very fondly the first two that were on PlayStation.

1014
01:18:15,556 --> 01:18:28,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And this Facebook group, the Suikoden Revival Movement, is a group that's trying to organize to get Konami's attention to get Suikoden 1 and 2 available on PlayStation Network worldwide.

1015
01:18:29,606 --> 01:18:35,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to get to the bottom of this because I'm like, wait a minute, I have Suikoden on PlayStation Network.

1016
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:38,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought it several years ago, so I know that's already there.

1017
01:18:38,495 --> 01:18:41,157
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is, I suppose, a campaign to get it done worldwide.

1018
01:18:41,518 --> 01:18:44,401
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that Suikoden 1 is not available in Europe.

1019
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet Coden 2 is kind of a rare game, too.

1020
01:18:48,002 --> 01:18:52,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, people pay a lot of money to get copies of that game if you can actually find it anywhere.

1021
01:18:53,544 --> 01:19:00,566
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be, although it would suck for the collectors to have it devalued a little bit, it's not like that kind of stuff hasn't happened before.

1022
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:06,147
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people asking, well, where's Sweet Coden 2, which some people say was the best that was in the series?

1023
01:19:06,227 --> 01:19:07,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little odd that that is missing.

1024
01:19:08,448 --> 01:19:24,711
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a fan campaign going on on Facebook and it's basically kind of like Operation Rainfall-esque where it's like bug Konami on Twitter on Tuesday, bug Konami on Facebook on Friday and just keep banging down their door until they get you what you want to shut you up.

1025
01:19:25,471 --> 01:19:29,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash SuikodenRevival is the place.

1026
01:19:29,173 --> 01:19:29,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out.

1027
01:19:29,753 --> 01:19:40,078
[SPEAKER_05]: S-U-I-K-O-D-E-N-R-E-V-I-V-A-L if you feel like joining in on the campaign, which I bet Shane is going to sign up for right now, although he probably already has the games on PlayStation.

1028
01:19:40,438 --> 01:19:42,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there PSP remakes in Japan, too?

1029
01:19:42,379 --> 01:19:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I remember that.

1030
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:43,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1031
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, is 1 and 2 really good enough?

1032
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:48,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Or don't you want 3, 4, and 5 at some point?

1033
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:53,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that they're putting PlayStation 2 games out on the PlayStation Network?

1034
01:19:53,662 --> 01:19:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh?

1035
01:19:54,963 --> 01:19:55,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1036
01:19:56,243 --> 01:20:02,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's move on to a time when gaming was a lot simpler and you didn't get to petition companies to tell them what you want.

1037
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:06,672
[SPEAKER_05]: You took what you got and you liked it.

1038
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:09,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the classic game of the week.

1039
01:20:10,415 --> 01:20:16,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week on the show, DarkSakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.

1040
01:20:16,299 --> 01:20:17,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But she's not here.

1041
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,581
[SPEAKER_05]: She's too busy on the Matterhorn.

1042
01:20:19,362 --> 01:20:24,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm jumping in and taking the classic game because Loki never told me if he wanted to do it.

1043
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:26,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to do the classic game tonight.

1044
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:31,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try to pick things I think DarkSakura may not have heard of and things I remember from my past.

1045
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:36,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So the classic game of the week I picked this week is an edutainment title.

1046
01:20:36,313 --> 01:20:36,953
[SPEAKER_05]: A little different.

1047
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:41,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called The Island of Dr. Brain is my classic game of the week.

1048
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:50,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, really we should kind of consider Dr. Brain as a series because The Island of Dr. Brain was not really the first game in this series.

1049
01:20:50,995 --> 01:20:53,596
[SPEAKER_05]: The Castle of Dr. Brain was the first game in this series.

1050
01:20:53,976 --> 01:20:57,597
[SPEAKER_05]: But Dr. Brain was a series that had, I think, four games in it.

1051
01:20:57,657 --> 01:20:58,037
[SPEAKER_05]: There was...

1052
01:20:59,837 --> 01:21:10,382
[SPEAKER_05]: There was the island of Dr. Brain, the castle of Dr. Brain was before that, and then later on, like about three years later, we had the Lost Mind of Dr. Brain and the Time Warp of Dr. Brain, although I don't remember those games as fondly.

1053
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:27,171
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think part of that is because Sierra, who actually created those first two games, created those in-house, but then they acquired Bright Star Technology, who was known for educational games, it got turned over to them, they made the Lost Mind of Dr. Brain and the Time Warp of Dr. Brain.

1054
01:21:27,751 --> 01:21:39,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dr. Brain is an absent-minded professor, and basically the idea in the games is to kind of follow Dr. Brain and kind of find him wherever he is.

1055
01:21:39,624 --> 01:21:47,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, The Island of Dr. Brain is kind of a play on The Island of Dr. Moreau, like the classic movie that then they remade into a terrible movie and so forth.

1056
01:21:48,073 --> 01:21:50,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Brain's Island of Dr. Brain

1057
01:22:04,612 --> 01:22:05,914
[SPEAKER_05]: The Islet of Dr. Brain

1058
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,296
[SPEAKER_05]: to get further and further in the island.

1059
01:22:24,316 --> 01:22:26,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were many types of different puzzles.

1060
01:22:26,116 --> 01:22:33,479
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like Tetris, Tetorino Animo, I forget what they call those.

1061
01:22:33,839 --> 01:22:40,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Those types of puzzles, the classic Tower of Babel style puzzles where you're moving the little towers from one pole to another.

1062
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:46,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Graphing calculator puzzles where you had to get the exact, thank you, Tetromino puzzles.

1063
01:22:46,863 --> 01:22:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: where you had to get the graph to draw just right to separate the four types of little amoebas under the microscope.

1064
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:55,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Latitude and longitude puzzles.

1065
01:22:55,851 --> 01:22:58,493
[SPEAKER_05]: There were all these different types of puzzles in the game.

1066
01:23:00,134 --> 01:23:09,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, in the plot of the game, the plans for the latest project were stolen and you have to get the battery from the island and bring it to Dr. Brain to basically fix the situation.

1067
01:23:09,782 --> 01:23:13,125
[SPEAKER_05]: There's security puzzles that Dr. Brain set up all over the island, though.

1068
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:14,586
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what you're solving.

1069
01:23:15,126 --> 01:23:16,567
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it was a Sierra game.

1070
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:18,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It was for DOS back in 1992.

1071
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:22,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And although it was kind of an educational title, I don't know, I kind of like puzzle games.

1072
01:23:23,071 --> 01:23:27,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of set the precedent for a lot of fun puzzle games.

1073
01:23:27,895 --> 01:23:29,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really it.

1074
01:23:29,456 --> 01:23:30,496
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say about it.

1075
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:32,398
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot else to say.

1076
01:23:32,738 --> 01:23:36,520
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a variety of different types of puzzles in it, and it's worth checking out.

1077
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:41,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And the prequel as well, The Castle of Dr. Brain, was also a solid entry in the series.

1078
01:23:41,564 --> 01:23:41,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1079
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:44,806
[SPEAKER_05]: This week's Classic Game of the Week, The Island of Dr. Brain.

1080
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:50,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, just follow the trail of my security puzzles if you have any problems solving them.

1081
01:23:50,635 --> 01:23:51,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give me a call.

1082
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:55,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1083
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:32,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys, we have plenty more of show to come, including Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, emails, if we got any, there weren't any in there last time I looked, the FUs of the Week, and of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1084
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:45,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you have something to say about this whole Kevin Butler situation, or Cliffy B leaving Epic Games, or porn on the 360, or whatever you want to talk about, we'll be taking your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1085
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:48,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1086
01:24:48,853 --> 01:24:54,238
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live with episode number 476 of our show for this October the 7th of 2012.

1087
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Just myself and Loki holding down the fort tonight.

1088
01:24:58,062 --> 01:25:06,149
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're just joining us, DarkSakura, she is at the happiest place on earth, which is even happier today with the Gay Days Anaheim going on right now.

1089
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:08,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people that are there right now.

1090
01:25:09,532 --> 01:25:30,314
[SPEAKER_05]: and you might be wondering why aren't you there um my pass expired for Disney I had an annual pass for Disneyland it actually expired at the end of September so I wouldn't have been able to make it and um it's like $450 or something to renew right now which you know if I was in a better financial situation I'd spend it because that's you know it's Disneyland's a great place but uh

1091
01:25:31,054 --> 01:25:34,177
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use the excuse to kind of take some time off from Disney for a while.

1092
01:25:34,257 --> 01:25:35,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just there two weeks ago anyway.

1093
01:25:35,718 --> 01:25:38,000
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the point, was to be like the last hurrah.

1094
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:43,365
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jamie, she's enjoying it for now while I'm on a little bit of hiatus.

1095
01:25:43,625 --> 01:25:49,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And she'll be back next week to pick a new classic game of the week and do all the things she does on the show.

1096
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:51,672
[SPEAKER_05]: But meanwhile, Loki and I holding down the fort.

1097
01:25:51,812 --> 01:25:56,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, you gotta tell the listeners what you were telling me during the break about your shopping excursions here.

1098
01:25:56,756 --> 01:25:58,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not shopping on anything.

1099
01:25:58,658 --> 01:26:02,962
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm making, well, designing something right now.

1100
01:26:02,982 --> 01:26:04,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, plotting.

1101
01:26:04,203 --> 01:26:05,964
[SPEAKER_05]: You're plotting something over there, clearly.

1102
01:26:05,984 --> 01:26:07,786
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily shopping.

1103
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:15,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so no, I was, um, you know, I'm always looking for, like, DDR machines and stuff like that.

1104
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:18,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things I wanted to do was rebuild my, you know, DDR pads.

1105
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:21,652
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I kind of saw, you know, all the designs that are out there and stuff.

1106
01:26:21,692 --> 01:26:25,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had bought stuff to make a certain, uh, design.

1107
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:27,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just kind of don't want to do that one anymore.

1108
01:26:27,614 --> 01:26:30,235
[SPEAKER_04]: So I happened to catch there was, um...

1109
01:26:31,736 --> 01:26:38,440
[SPEAKER_04]: On Bomani Sao's site, some guy was selling one of his beat gear pads.

1110
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:47,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you don't remember, beat gear pads, at one time there was a guy that was going to be creating the most arcade authentic pads out there.

1111
01:26:47,446 --> 01:26:49,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we played some awesome music.

1112
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I guess it was appropriate since Loki's talking about old games to play the classic Game of the Week music.

1113
01:26:57,252 --> 01:26:57,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

1114
01:26:58,972 --> 01:27:11,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, so this guy's selling the beatgear pad and they've got some shots of it and stuff and that kind of linked to another website that had some more shots of the pad and likes it taken apart and stuff like that.

1115
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:24,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So based on those pictures, I'm designing the schematics for it to make my own or to mass produce them if I want to since no one has done it.

1116
01:27:24,859 --> 01:27:24,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And

1117
01:27:25,819 --> 01:27:27,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's why I'm working on it.

1118
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,621
[SPEAKER_05]: But you wouldn't scam people out of their money.

1119
01:27:30,222 --> 01:27:30,463
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1120
01:27:31,243 --> 01:27:33,065
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an honest guy, and I know where you live.

1121
01:27:33,285 --> 01:27:36,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, everyone knows where I live.

1122
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:48,376
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was kind of curious to see how much it's going to cost to do it and how I would actually have to do it, because I think it looked like it was injected molded plastic and stuff, and they use different sensors than arcade sensors.

1123
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:48,656
[SPEAKER_04]: They use...

1124
01:27:49,757 --> 01:27:52,778
[SPEAKER_04]: They're tape switches, or what they're called, I guess.

1125
01:27:52,938 --> 01:27:54,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually buy those really cheap.

1126
01:27:54,919 --> 01:28:01,562
[SPEAKER_04]: They come in a big, long string of them.

1127
01:28:02,042 --> 01:28:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I found them for $10 for eight feet of that stuff, and you'd only need a few inches per pad.

1128
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:37,214
[SPEAKER_04]: um maybe a few feet per pad um but I mean 10 bucks for you know a ton of switches versus 10 bucks a switch kind of a kind of a big deal there but um yeah so arcade parts they actually use the arcade arrows they use um the way I'm designing is going to use arcade um neons as well um and I don't know about the arcade switches because those are really fucking expensive I'd rather go the tape tape switch route um

1129
01:28:37,654 --> 01:28:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll always be the DDR fan, now and forever.

1130
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:40,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1131
01:28:41,377 --> 01:28:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I always am.

1132
01:28:42,378 --> 01:28:44,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Half the stuff I do is for DDR stuff.

1133
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it for the dinner.

1134
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:48,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so that's what I've been working on.

1135
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:50,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's what I've been working on this week.

1136
01:28:50,484 --> 01:29:01,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Last few days I've been playing Minecraft or anything, or Borderlands 2, because I've been playing in SketchUp trying to draw what I see and getting the measurements right based on...

1137
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:05,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Other things that are injection molded and stuff like that.

1138
01:29:06,116 --> 01:29:08,478
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the support braces and stuff in there.

1139
01:29:09,299 --> 01:29:11,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Just getting the right size.

1140
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I have nailed it pretty well.

1141
01:29:14,723 --> 01:29:18,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Just knowing measurements of different things.

1142
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:19,387
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1143
01:29:20,628 --> 01:29:22,509
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about injection molding stuff is...

1144
01:29:23,934 --> 01:29:52,126
[SPEAKER_04]: it may be somewhat cheap for the parts but the initial cost is pretty expensive so it may not even be by the time I'm done worth it doing because make the parts would be a few thousand dollars which you know it's good if you're mass producing them because then you know you cost average all that stuff out and it gets pretty cheap but if you're making like one pad or two pads that might not work out too well you know it'd be well over the cost of a DDR machine what's the point at that point

1145
01:29:53,827 --> 01:29:54,087
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1146
01:29:54,127 --> 01:30:00,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, before we get into rapid fire news to take things a slightly different direction for a minute, I like some of this reminiscing people are doing in the chat room.

1147
01:30:00,752 --> 01:30:03,755
[SPEAKER_05]: They're talking about this service Imagination.

1148
01:30:03,935 --> 01:30:10,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally never heard of that one, but they're talking about some of the other old school dial-up services and things that used to exist back in the day.

1149
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:11,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Qlink.

1150
01:30:11,501 --> 01:30:12,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that one.

1151
01:30:12,161 --> 01:30:13,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that actually called Quantum Link?

1152
01:30:13,602 --> 01:30:14,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think they shortened it to Qlink.

1153
01:30:15,284 --> 01:30:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1154
01:30:22,529 --> 01:30:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that and I always wanted to get on that with my 300 baud modem.

1155
01:30:27,111 --> 01:30:30,352
[SPEAKER_05]: But my parents, you know, I was only like probably eight at the time.

1156
01:30:30,372 --> 01:30:31,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't want me on that stuff.

1157
01:30:31,753 --> 01:30:34,854
[SPEAKER_05]: But Vandy brought up Genie and Prodigy.

1158
01:30:35,234 --> 01:30:35,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on Prodigy.

1159
01:30:36,035 --> 01:30:38,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on Prodigy too and I still remember my number to this day.

1160
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I know I've talked about it on a previous show.

1161
01:30:41,497 --> 01:30:44,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I got in a lot of trouble thanks to Prodigy chat rooms.

1162
01:30:44,298 --> 01:30:44,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

1163
01:30:45,718 --> 01:31:09,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I got in trouble just I think because one of the Prodigy numbers it dialed was a long distance number and we were on it for like a long time so it like you know it racked up a pretty big phone bill but yeah the earliest modem I had was just a 2400 baud modem but yeah BBSs that was some good times oh I spent so much time on BBSs back in the day

1164
01:31:11,087 --> 01:31:11,727
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

1165
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:15,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And BBSs wouldn't suddenly disconnect the stream like apparently just happened here.

1166
01:31:15,989 --> 01:31:16,670
[SPEAKER_05]: What is up?

1167
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:18,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a Comcast issue, guys.

1168
01:31:18,491 --> 01:31:18,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not us.

1169
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:19,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1170
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:22,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We should be back online now, though.

1171
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:23,414
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows the streaming data.

1172
01:31:23,454 --> 01:31:23,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But where were we?

1173
01:31:24,054 --> 01:31:24,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, BBSs.

1174
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:28,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to call so many BBSs when I was like 12 to 15.

1175
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:32,179
[SPEAKER_04]: What we used to have was the California Computer News magazine.

1176
01:31:32,199 --> 01:31:32,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1177
01:31:32,599 --> 01:31:35,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I probably hung out on the same BBSs and didn't even know it.

1178
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:37,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1179
01:31:38,002 --> 01:31:38,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

1180
01:31:38,983 --> 01:31:45,450
[SPEAKER_05]: What were some of the big... My favorite BBS back in the day in the Sacramento area was one called The Open Mind.

1181
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:46,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I still remember it to this day.

1182
01:31:46,932 --> 01:31:49,254
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was huge on the forums.

1183
01:31:49,454 --> 01:31:51,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a very active forum community.

1184
01:31:51,216 --> 01:31:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I met a lot of great people on there.

1185
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:56,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was one you could dial into to play Doom 2 online.

1186
01:31:57,503 --> 01:32:00,424
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was the one where you had to buy credits after you used so much.

1187
01:32:02,904 --> 01:32:06,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember some of the big ones that were here locally, but I used to play all that shit.

1188
01:32:06,285 --> 01:32:12,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars 2002, The Pit with its graphical client.

1189
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:13,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

1190
01:32:13,726 --> 01:32:19,048
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one BBS I used to dial into that actually would let you have internet access for like 15 minutes a day.

1191
01:32:19,728 --> 01:32:21,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fantastic.

1192
01:32:22,147 --> 01:32:23,888
[SPEAKER_04]: and then also all the AOL discs.

1193
01:32:23,948 --> 01:32:27,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you would just be swimming in those things.

1194
01:32:27,289 --> 01:32:28,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd go to cancel.

1195
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:29,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, would you like in there a free month?

1196
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:29,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

1197
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:31,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Free month.

1198
01:32:31,411 --> 01:32:42,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember asking and begging my mom to let me call the long distance number to the Sierra BBS for like 20 minutes so I could download a game demo that I really want.

1199
01:32:42,335 --> 01:32:47,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember what it was now but there was something on there that I really wanted because Sierra had an official BBS back in the day.

1200
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:49,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1201
01:32:50,019 --> 01:32:52,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Dial back verification, all that good stuff.

1202
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:56,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried running a BBS, but my parents would never let me have the second line.

1203
01:32:57,004 --> 01:33:04,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was one of those, you know, my really good friend Neil could call in when we set up a certain time.

1204
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:07,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my mom would pick up the phone to call one of her friends.

1205
01:33:08,014 --> 01:33:09,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what the hell are you doing?

1206
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:11,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

1207
01:33:13,187 --> 01:33:14,007
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

1208
01:33:14,528 --> 01:33:15,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Enough reminiscing.

1209
01:33:15,248 --> 01:33:16,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk rapid-fire news.

1210
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:17,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start us off.

1211
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:20,632
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm very excited about this game coming out.

1212
01:33:20,672 --> 01:33:23,134
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long, long time coming.

1213
01:33:23,954 --> 01:33:31,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Retro City Rampage, which originally started off as a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES and then just spun out from there.

1214
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:36,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has so many homages to, like, just all this 8-bit stuff.

1215
01:33:36,743 --> 01:33:37,764
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they've got...

1216
01:33:39,105 --> 01:33:40,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything you can possibly think of.

1217
01:33:40,127 --> 01:33:50,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They have levels that are based off of Metal Gear, levels based off of Breakthrough, levels based off of Bionic Commando, Mega Man, Blaster Master, all sorts of crazy stuff.

1218
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:54,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

1219
01:33:54,544 --> 01:33:57,928
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing the cross-buy thing too with that, so that's where I'm purchasing it.

1220
01:33:59,029 --> 01:34:04,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I do also want it on my Xbox 360 and maybe on Steam.

1221
01:34:04,273 --> 01:34:07,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So I may actually purchase it on every single platform that comes out.

1222
01:34:07,535 --> 01:34:11,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's $14.99, so that'll be coming out this week on the 9th.

1223
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:13,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't wait.

1224
01:34:13,399 --> 01:34:15,000
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll probably be the game I'm playing this week.

1225
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:19,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very much like a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 type game, top down.

1226
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:21,064
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just all sorts of crazy.

1227
01:34:21,124 --> 01:34:22,665
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like Super Meat Boy stuff.

1228
01:34:22,885 --> 01:34:26,347
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Super Meat Boy game that's done like the Virtual Boy in the game.

1229
01:34:26,548 --> 01:34:28,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be fantastic.

1230
01:34:31,334 --> 01:34:40,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week, one of the announcements, I guess, Namco Bandai is removing Nobi Nobi Boy from the iOS App Store, also on Tuesday.

1231
01:34:42,003 --> 01:34:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently they haven't really said why it's being removed.

1232
01:34:45,924 --> 01:34:48,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It is being removed by Namco Bandai, not Apple.

1233
01:34:48,806 --> 01:34:52,927
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently there's some functionality that hasn't been working for a few months.

1234
01:34:53,027 --> 01:34:59,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they've just decided that we're going to get rid of it or something.

1235
01:34:59,209 --> 01:35:03,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad.

1236
01:35:03,331 --> 01:35:07,012
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to play the game, I guess download it now so you have it.

1237
01:35:08,533 --> 01:35:08,973
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is $1.99. $1.99.

1238
01:35:11,886 --> 01:35:13,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a new Kickstarter.

1239
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:15,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually saw this one.

1240
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:17,572
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kickstarter for Old School RPG.

1241
01:35:18,473 --> 01:35:23,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being created by Brenda Brathwaite and Tom Hall.

1242
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:33,628
[SPEAKER_04]: You may not remember them, but of course they worked on some of the older game series like Wizardry and Dungeons & Dragons.

1243
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:36,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Brenda Brathwaite actually sounds very familiar.

1244
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:39,212
[SPEAKER_05]: She was like an old school RPG person, right?

1245
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:42,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and then Tom Hall was the founder of id Software.

1246
01:35:42,334 --> 01:35:43,254
[SPEAKER_04]: He made Commander Keen.

1247
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:46,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy shit, Commander Keen.

1248
01:35:47,377 --> 01:35:52,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of those demos I downloaded for 30 minutes on my 2014 or whatever.

1249
01:35:52,821 --> 01:36:00,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, one of the things I liked doing was we had a local video store that had a shareware table.

1250
01:36:00,846 --> 01:36:03,588
[SPEAKER_04]: A table where you just buy floppy disks of all sorts of games.

1251
01:36:04,989 --> 01:36:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times, man.

1252
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:34,706
[SPEAKER_05]: in less than a minute.

1253
01:36:37,076 --> 01:36:39,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of where we're going to be 20 years from now.

1254
01:36:39,717 --> 01:36:40,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even.

1255
01:36:40,218 --> 01:36:41,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy shit.

1256
01:36:41,298 --> 01:36:42,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Like five years from now.

1257
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:43,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy shit.

1258
01:36:43,699 --> 01:36:44,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, sorry.

1259
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:55,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently if you pledge $15 you'll get a digital copy of the game and of course they've got all sorts of different things.

1260
01:36:56,166 --> 01:37:05,271
[SPEAKER_04]: They even have a $10,000 pledge point where they will show up to your door with a red velvet or deliver the game in a box on a red velvet pillow on a red carpet.

1261
01:37:05,851 --> 01:37:33,397
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's pretty funny and you know they also had one of their stretch goals is that they'll make two full games so neat also DLC Quest the game we kind of talked about a while I actually played it on the indie games but it's one of the games that's on the whole green light thing and one of their promises if they get green lit is that they're going to add some new content which is good because that game's only like one or two hours long

1262
01:37:34,257 --> 01:37:56,296
[SPEAKER_04]: and the new DLC is going to be called live freemium or die and they have I guess a new campaign world or new campaign new world new enemies and buckets of new DLC to purchase and that they're saying that that's at the launch um the fourth quarter of this year uh which is pretty funny and um

1263
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:25,300
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah, and then that's it alrighty I got a few stories for you guys as well first off, something about Star Wars Final Assault hopefully this will be one of the Star Wars games that isn't terrible because they're hit and miss sometimes they're really good sometimes they're really not good but Star Wars Final Assault will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade there is an image out there floating around of the actual artwork that will be used on the arcade that's kind of how they spilled it there

1264
01:38:26,461 --> 01:38:31,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So the game was first announced way back in August when there were trademark and domain registrations.

1265
01:38:31,265 --> 01:38:34,768
[SPEAKER_05]: But this game, it's funny to note, still has not been officially announced.

1266
01:38:34,908 --> 01:38:36,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't even really know exactly what it is.

1267
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:38,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they haven't announced it.

1268
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:39,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out of a leak.

1269
01:38:39,953 --> 01:38:41,174
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a leak of all the different...

1270
01:38:41,754 --> 01:38:46,840
[SPEAKER_04]: All the fourth quarter titles that were coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1271
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:51,064
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually some other ones I saw that were interesting, but I don't remember what it was.

1272
01:38:51,725 --> 01:38:54,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, could one of them be this game I'm going to mention next?

1273
01:38:54,648 --> 01:38:55,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Karateka?

1274
01:38:55,789 --> 01:38:56,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I could never say this.

1275
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,651
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically karate.

1276
01:38:57,931 --> 01:38:58,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Karateka.

1277
01:38:58,712 --> 01:38:59,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's the way you would say it.

1278
01:38:59,833 --> 01:39:00,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Karateka.

1279
01:39:01,134 --> 01:39:03,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember this old, old game.

1280
01:39:03,996 --> 01:39:07,438
[SPEAKER_05]: This was back in the Commodore 64 days and all that, and it was in the arcades too.

1281
01:39:07,739 --> 01:39:09,280
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a remake now coming out.

1282
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:18,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously it's now 3D, a little more inspired by the Street Fighter IVs of the world and so forth, but still kind of cool that it's on Xbox Live Arcade.

1283
01:39:18,245 --> 01:39:19,266
[SPEAKER_05]: It's small enough to be there.

1284
01:39:20,027 --> 01:39:24,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox.com actually had this posted.

1285
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:29,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't supposed to be an official announcement, but people that were scouring Xbox.com actually found it.

1286
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:33,275
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is supposed to be out, I believe, relatively soon.

1287
01:39:33,335 --> 01:39:35,537
[SPEAKER_05]: November-ish is when that remake is coming out.

1288
01:39:35,597 --> 01:39:37,278
[SPEAKER_05]: November 16th?

1289
01:39:37,558 --> 01:39:37,778
[SPEAKER_05]: 14th?

1290
01:39:38,359 --> 01:39:41,201
[SPEAKER_05]: 14th, that link is to be believed that was found on Xbox.com.

1291
01:39:43,723 --> 01:39:45,744
[SPEAKER_05]: This fad isn't going to die anytime soon.

1292
01:39:45,784 --> 01:39:47,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Gangnam Style Dance.

1293
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:49,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes.

1294
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:52,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now available to your character in Free Realms.

1295
01:39:53,649 --> 01:39:58,513
[SPEAKER_05]: You might remember Free Realms as the free-to-play MMO that's available on the PlayStation 3 and

1296
01:39:59,677 --> 01:40:00,778
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks.

1297
01:40:01,759 --> 01:40:03,640
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, you can do this dance in the game.

1298
01:40:03,901 --> 01:40:05,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I love about the trailer.

1299
01:40:06,183 --> 01:40:08,384
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't use the actual music.

1300
01:40:08,565 --> 01:40:09,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, son of a bitch.

1301
01:40:09,806 --> 01:40:11,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about the E.T.

1302
01:40:11,087 --> 01:40:11,667
[SPEAKER_05]: re-release.

1303
01:40:11,727 --> 01:40:13,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me the freaking movie I really want to see.

1304
01:40:14,009 --> 01:40:15,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have walkie-talkies anymore.

1305
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:16,311
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important.

1306
01:40:17,152 --> 01:40:18,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Even on the Blu-ray version?

1307
01:40:18,413 --> 01:40:19,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they went back to it.

1308
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:20,895
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they got rid of it, I think.

1309
01:40:21,575 --> 01:40:23,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Spielberg said he regretted that.

1310
01:40:24,057 --> 01:40:25,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we need to have a conversation about E.T.? ?

1311
01:40:26,907 --> 01:40:27,607
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here we go.

1312
01:40:27,627 --> 01:40:28,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the actual trailer.

1313
01:40:28,568 --> 01:40:30,088
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to use fake music.

1314
01:40:30,668 --> 01:40:34,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's the actual dance.

1315
01:40:36,671 --> 01:40:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the problem with this.

1316
01:40:37,871 --> 01:40:41,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only is Free Realms kind of crap, but let's be real.

1317
01:40:41,592 --> 01:40:47,174
[SPEAKER_05]: The moment that sold that video for most people was when he was dancing over the guy in the elevator.

1318
01:40:47,274 --> 01:40:51,176
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the best part of the entire video, and I don't see that represented here in Free Realms.

1319
01:40:52,935 --> 01:40:56,316
[SPEAKER_05]: and everybody's saying, why aren't the panda bears doing this in Mists of Pandaria?

1320
01:40:56,936 --> 01:41:02,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because they programmed that dance in like nine months ago, way before Gangnam Style was a thing.

1321
01:41:03,477 --> 01:41:04,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And there you have it.

1322
01:41:06,038 --> 01:41:09,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, a Wii U demo interface has been shown.

1323
01:41:09,559 --> 01:41:14,640
[SPEAKER_05]: This is because the Wii U demo kiosk is now available in the official store in New York City.

1324
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,140
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if some of our New York City fans are nearby.

1325
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to check that out, but you can check that out.

1326
01:41:19,441 --> 01:41:20,781
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Wii U demo station.

1327
01:41:21,361 --> 01:41:45,531
[SPEAKER_05]: and it has some of the cover art for some of the various games there you can select whatever demo cover art you want to play and you get a video or you get to actually play the demo depending on what it is apparently only Rayman Legends is actually usable but who knows I mean this is still really early on the console is still a good month and a half away so I imagine they'll add more to this but that's available at the official Nintendo store so those of you that are in New York might want to check that out

1328
01:41:47,173 --> 01:41:51,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1329
01:42:01,576 --> 01:42:05,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma, the ever great reporter for VOG, says he'll go by there tomorrow.

1330
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:06,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out.

1331
01:42:07,302 --> 01:42:08,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Get on it, Ranma.

1332
01:42:09,884 --> 01:42:10,705
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1333
01:42:11,946 --> 01:42:12,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Fugo question of the week.

1334
01:42:13,027 --> 01:42:13,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Very simple this week.

1335
01:42:14,008 --> 01:42:16,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I'd tie it into what we talked about at the beginning of the show.

1336
01:42:16,591 --> 01:42:19,734
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the scariest video game you've ever played and why?

1337
01:42:22,313 --> 01:42:23,054
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1338
01:42:46,703 --> 01:43:10,031
[SPEAKER_05]: James S replied there's another games on PC that I haven't played but would love to like Amnesia or Slenderman my computer is ancient so I have to go with a console game I know it sounds cliche but Silent Hill 2 and 3 collection was phenomenal I can't remember how many times I had to turn it off when playing alone at night because I was literally dreading turning around that next darkened corner freaky music in the background and none of the stupid team co-op stuff to ruin it

1339
01:43:10,831 --> 01:43:12,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Space 1 and 2 Need I Say More?

1340
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:55,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Shattered Hawk says as a kid I used to own Shadow Man for the N64 the music mixed with monsters gave me nightmares the pig guys with the hooks that screamed when they spotted you still gives me the chills I never played that game but that sounds scary Tim N says Silent Hill 2 it is peerless as far as horror goes the rest are pretenders some strong words there

1341
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:59,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamer Girl says, I know you only asked for one, but I have two.

1342
01:43:59,947 --> 01:44:02,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Eternal Darkness was really scary for me.

1343
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:06,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but when you get to the part where your heart starts racing in game, it was over for me in real life.

1344
01:44:07,132 --> 01:44:07,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1345
01:44:07,412 --> 01:44:08,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm a huge music lover.

1346
01:44:08,673 --> 01:44:09,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel whatever I'm listening to.

1347
01:44:09,974 --> 01:44:11,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Same goes for Fear, F-E-A-R.

1348
01:44:12,276 --> 01:44:16,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are two of the most scariest games for me, but somehow I still love it.

1349
01:44:17,758 --> 01:44:20,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow says the original fear was really creepy.

1350
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:24,361
[SPEAKER_05]: The first few missions had great jump scares and you didn't.

1351
01:44:24,401 --> 01:44:25,522
[SPEAKER_05]: He spoils part two.

1352
01:44:25,542 --> 01:44:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have to read that on Facebook to see that.

1353
01:44:28,123 --> 01:44:30,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike B says Jaws Unleashed.

1354
01:44:30,104 --> 01:44:31,264
[SPEAKER_05]: It was scary bad.

1355
01:44:32,005 --> 01:44:33,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew somebody would go with the showgirls.

1356
01:44:34,025 --> 01:44:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Jaws wasn't that bad.

1357
01:44:35,726 --> 01:44:38,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it was Unleashed though.

1358
01:44:39,008 --> 01:44:41,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that like the remake one where you can play as the shark?

1359
01:44:41,789 --> 01:44:43,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the shark one looked fun.

1360
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:43,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1361
01:44:44,691 --> 01:44:46,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Falcon said, return to Castle Wolfenstein.

1362
01:44:47,132 --> 01:44:50,312
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a small part in the game that just startled the crap out of me during gameplay.

1363
01:44:50,652 --> 01:44:56,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I was walking through a snowy field and everything was quiet and calm and the Nazis jumped out of nowhere and made me jump out of my skin.

1364
01:44:56,353 --> 01:44:57,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Shot the crap out of me.

1365
01:44:57,314 --> 01:44:58,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Nazis always scare me.

1366
01:44:59,214 --> 01:45:05,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Another vote for Silent Hill 2 from Clover N. Chiggers says, Bioshock had a moment that scared the shit out of me.

1367
01:45:05,795 --> 01:45:09,776
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those zombie dudes jumped out from behind a coffin and made me drop the controller.

1368
01:45:09,876 --> 01:45:10,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking zombies.

1369
01:45:11,637 --> 01:45:12,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Bioshock was really scary.

1370
01:45:14,137 --> 01:45:36,431
[SPEAKER_05]: DDR Dollar Bill says Haunted House on the 2600 when you could not see the walls at all no weapons and could not even see behind the doors drop my damn controller every time I opened one and a damn spider or bat or ghost killed me quite honestly I'd like to see a follow up of scariest moments Haunted House on the 2600 was kind of old school survival horror I think they remade that for the 360 yeah and it's shit yeah

1371
01:45:38,326 --> 01:45:41,189
[SPEAKER_05]: and DJ Ranma S replied and said, Bioshock.

1372
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:46,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And a very similar story to what Chiggers had mentioned before with somebody popping out there.

1373
01:45:47,275 --> 01:45:49,377
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, well played 2K Games, well played.

1374
01:45:49,797 --> 01:45:51,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to Google Plus and look at some of the answers there.

1375
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:55,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Marcus E. says, Haunting Ground.

1376
01:45:56,829 --> 01:46:03,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though the Capcom game focuses on a busty gal running around like some horror flick, it managed to be much deeper.

1377
01:46:03,511 --> 01:46:09,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Any game where your only option is to run seems scary by default, but the atmosphere in Haunting Ground was fantastic.

1378
01:46:10,253 --> 01:46:18,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Pair that with supremely creepy stalkers, foreboding locations, and a terrifying soundtrack, and the game was one of the best horror titles.

1379
01:46:18,575 --> 01:46:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I must give you one example of how the game managed to be so scary.

1380
01:46:22,136 --> 01:46:24,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Haunted Ground focuses on hiding since you can rarely fight back.

1381
01:46:25,399 --> 01:46:30,323
[SPEAKER_05]: At one point, I was running from an antagonist, rushed down a hallway into a room, and

1382
01:46:32,408 --> 01:46:58,724
[SPEAKER_05]: went down in the room and went to hide in the closet guess what she was in the closet waiting for me moments like that just made the game near perfect Actdeft says aside from Silent Hill, Eversion that game is really fucked up and so much too lastly Red Entertainment says Silent Hill 3 I had to stop playing that game near the end so the fear that was building up in my body could leave me I occasionally still hear the sounds of those damn demon dogs

1383
01:47:00,025 --> 01:47:15,053
[SPEAKER_05]: so there it is the answers from Facebook and Google Plus Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or you can look us up on Google Plus if you want to answer in a future week some things I was surprised not to hear did you notice some of the games that were left out?

1384
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:29,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard one person mention Amnesia but didn't pick that as their most scary no Resident Evils I didn't hear Clock Tower which I always thought was kind of a fucked I guess that was maybe more I don't know I kind of thought it was scary Fatal Frame yeah

1385
01:47:30,851 --> 01:47:33,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a lot of stuff that wasn't there, but still some good picks.

1386
01:47:33,353 --> 01:47:36,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying you guys didn't pick good stuff, but lots of love for Silent Hill, apparently.

1387
01:47:36,815 --> 01:47:37,275
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1388
01:47:38,476 --> 01:47:39,997
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there it is, your Fugle Question of the Week.

1389
01:47:40,277 --> 01:47:41,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get back into some more news.

1390
01:47:41,718 --> 01:47:46,021
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not too far away from the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1391
01:47:46,061 --> 01:47:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just yet, though.

1392
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:47,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Some more news stories first.

1393
01:47:48,202 --> 01:47:51,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sony likes doing a lot of different bundles, especially around the holidays.

1394
01:47:52,185 --> 01:47:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that they said, yeah, we're not...

1395
01:47:57,428 --> 01:47:59,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Not going to do it, but it might be a cool idea.

1396
01:48:01,451 --> 01:48:07,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently they're thinking that, hey, maybe someday we'll do a bundle that includes a Vita and a PlayStation 3.

1397
01:48:09,156 --> 01:48:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that could be possible if they have some more of those games that are going to be kind of working like...

1398
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:18,622
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Wii U or the Xbox Smart Glass stuff.

1399
01:48:18,662 --> 01:48:21,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe if that becomes popular, they might do this.

1400
01:48:23,726 --> 01:48:29,971
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd have to get a hell of a lot cheaper, though, because it's going to be a hard sell to have a portable system and a regular system in there.

1401
01:48:30,531 --> 01:48:39,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that bundle's going to have to be a heck of a deal, but it's going to look like twice as much as the Wii U. Yeah.

1402
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1403
01:48:42,581 --> 01:48:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, they don't have a whole lot of interconnectivity between the two systems.

1404
01:48:47,263 --> 01:48:51,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Some games kind of use it, but not a whole ton.

1405
01:48:51,725 --> 01:48:53,066
[SPEAKER_04]: But they could.

1406
01:48:53,586 --> 01:48:54,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They could.

1407
01:48:54,527 --> 01:48:55,167
[SPEAKER_04]: They could do anything.

1408
01:48:55,207 --> 01:48:57,448
[SPEAKER_04]: They could bundle it with a TV.

1409
01:48:57,628 --> 01:48:58,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they've done that.

1410
01:48:58,809 --> 01:48:59,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1411
01:49:00,010 --> 01:49:06,153
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not outside the realm of possibility, but is it going to be something that people are going to be looking for?

1412
01:49:06,653 --> 01:49:07,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

1413
01:49:08,829 --> 01:49:09,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Options!

1414
01:49:09,429 --> 01:49:10,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, people like options.

1415
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:20,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, some options people would like to see on the Wii U is more variety in games and some more things that address the hardcore.

1416
01:49:20,692 --> 01:49:26,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, follow-ups to some of those big Operation Rainfall games, The Last Story and Xenoblade.

1417
01:49:26,853 --> 01:49:37,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Reggie Fils-Aimé made a comment, I believe this was to, I think it was to Kotaku, actually, about Xenoblade and The Last Story and all that.

1418
01:49:38,837 --> 01:49:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: The comment was about What is Monolith Soft doing now?

1419
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:43,722
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the Wii U game that they're making?

1420
01:49:44,222 --> 01:49:53,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And the quote is this We know that they're working on a game I personally haven't seen it But I know there's a lot of excitement in Japan and Kyoto About what they're working on So I look forward to seeing it

1421
01:49:54,233 --> 01:50:00,956
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, if it's a game that we decide to publish from what would be a second-party standpoint, certainly we'd love to bring it here to the U.S.

1422
01:50:01,416 --> 01:50:08,659
[SPEAKER_05]: The way we look at the opportunity is, given a level of marketing support, how much are we going to sell, and is it going to be a profitable venture?

1423
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:12,080
[SPEAKER_05]: So a whole lot of nothing kind of about, you know...

1424
01:50:12,860 --> 01:50:14,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll release it.

1425
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:15,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we won't.

1426
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:21,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I found some of the comments on this particular website a little more interesting than the article itself.

1427
01:50:22,142 --> 01:50:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: MyNintendoNews.com is where some of these comments come from.

1428
01:50:25,043 --> 01:50:29,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people are kind of talking about, like they're fighting about, did Xenoblade do well or not?

1429
01:50:29,404 --> 01:50:33,085
[SPEAKER_05]: One commenter says, I bet the Wii U game will do well since Xenoblade did well.

1430
01:50:33,145 --> 01:50:35,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody replies to that, it did well.

1431
01:50:35,105 --> 01:50:37,626
[SPEAKER_05]: It barely sold 300,000 copies in North America.

1432
01:50:37,646 --> 01:50:38,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

1433
01:50:38,966 --> 01:50:39,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw this this week.

1434
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:41,608
[SPEAKER_04]: The last story, it's out of print.

1435
01:50:42,049 --> 01:50:42,889
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not making it anymore.

1436
01:50:43,029 --> 01:50:43,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.

1437
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:48,594
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was something that was being put out by XSEED, so it's kind of their M.O.

1438
01:50:49,254 --> 01:50:50,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Atlas does the same thing.

1439
01:50:51,036 --> 01:50:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of make a small initial lot and then they sell through it and put it out of print.

1440
01:50:56,039 --> 01:51:00,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, I don't think they sold that well.

1441
01:51:01,058 --> 01:51:09,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, somebody replies, though, and this is a good point, okay, $300,000 doesn't seem that bad when you consider it was only available at two places, Nintendo's website or GameStop.

1442
01:51:10,723 --> 01:51:15,585
[SPEAKER_05]: No Amazon, no Walmart, no Best Buy, none of that.

1443
01:51:15,725 --> 01:51:16,385
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't matter, though.

1444
01:51:16,405 --> 01:51:19,347
[SPEAKER_04]: For the people that wanted that game, they could get it there.

1445
01:51:19,527 --> 01:51:23,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's be honest, GameStop is the largest game retailer out there, so...

1446
01:51:23,789 --> 01:51:24,189
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

1447
01:51:49,184 --> 01:51:49,564
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1448
01:52:10,237 --> 01:52:13,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, BlackWolf wants to correct something you said.

1449
01:52:13,479 --> 01:52:15,579
[SPEAKER_05]: He says Walmart is the largest game retailer.

1450
01:52:15,879 --> 01:52:16,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it.

1451
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:22,261
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop may be the largest specialty retailer, but Walmart is the largest retailer of a lot of things.

1452
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:31,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they're the largest retailer of, you know, retailer out there, but as far as game specialty as, you know, category, GameStop is far beyond Walmart.

1453
01:52:31,884 --> 01:52:36,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Walmart may sell through a lot of stuff, but the biggest chunk is going to GameStop.

1454
01:52:36,066 --> 01:52:36,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I see a lot of

1455
01:52:37,646 --> 01:53:06,168
[SPEAKER_05]: special stuff being done for GameStop like a lot of exclusives you don't see Walmart exclusives for that stuff on movies though you do you do see some Walmart exclusive things rarely but you do and I would argue that you probably do see more actual games at the end of the day sold at Walmart than you do at GameStop same thing with the CDs you wouldn't think Walmart's the largest CD retailer in the world but they are maybe with iTunes in the picture it's a little different now but the largest physical CD retailer in the world they're the largest retailer of a lot of stuff like it or not

1456
01:53:09,328 --> 01:53:10,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, that's all I wanted to say about that.

1457
01:53:12,188 --> 01:53:13,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on, Loki.

1458
01:53:42,177 --> 01:53:43,578
[SPEAKER_04]: to the Washington, D.C.

1459
01:53:43,658 --> 01:53:46,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Public Library, I guess the Martin Luther King branch.

1460
01:53:47,561 --> 01:53:55,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to allow different gamers with all sorts of different disabilities to be able to enjoy games.

1461
01:53:55,208 --> 01:54:04,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to see games with maybe some audio-only games, that kind of stuff in there.

1462
01:54:04,995 --> 01:54:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And

1463
01:54:05,856 --> 01:54:13,141
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't really said what specific types of games are going to be in there, but I can kind of imagine the stuff that they have.

1464
01:54:14,002 --> 01:54:18,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess this is opening very soon.

1465
01:54:19,305 --> 01:54:21,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Or actually, by the looks of it, it's already open.

1466
01:54:22,327 --> 01:54:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

1467
01:54:23,508 --> 01:54:24,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1468
01:54:25,834 --> 01:54:27,214
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1469
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:57,311
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to hear that not only is something opening up, even though it's a library and all that stuff, so it isn't like an arcade in the traditional sense.

1470
01:54:58,012 --> 01:55:05,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat that not only is something opening up, but it's opening up with a broader idea in mind and something new.

1471
01:55:06,241 --> 01:55:06,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1472
01:55:06,622 --> 01:55:11,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, now we look at it and go, oh, this is something we should have had all along, but this is a great idea.

1473
01:55:12,728 --> 01:55:13,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's hope it does well for them.

1474
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it'll start a trend.

1475
01:55:16,292 --> 01:55:22,078
[SPEAKER_05]: But sadly, I think with how arcades have been doing recently, I think the trend has already been had.

1476
01:55:23,706 --> 01:55:28,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, there were a few Nintendo Direct conferences this week that talk about the 3DS.

1477
01:55:29,127 --> 01:55:31,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get to find out what's in store for the 3DS this year.

1478
01:55:33,228 --> 01:55:42,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there's a sequel being made to Pushmo, Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania the Adventure, and some other games developed by Level 5 and so forth.

1479
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:44,311
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some good stuff that's actually original.

1480
01:55:45,531 --> 01:56:03,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Night Sky is coming out October 25th that is an action puzzle game that will be an ambient gameplay experience with cerebral challenges that will be uniquely designed picturesque worlds by the way these are all eShop titles I probably should have put that out there too Crashmo is the sequel to Pushmo on November 22nd

1481
01:56:05,217 --> 01:56:08,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Fluidity Spin Cycle is on December 27th.

1482
01:56:08,901 --> 01:56:10,723
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to make use of the tilt.

1483
01:56:10,903 --> 01:56:13,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of games have been using the gyroscope in there.

1484
01:56:13,806 --> 01:56:21,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will have tilt and turn and all that stuff to maneuver a puddle of water named Eddie through a maze-like world.

1485
01:56:22,055 --> 01:56:26,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can do liquid to ice or steam, solid liquid gas type of thing.

1486
01:56:27,461 --> 01:56:30,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that sounds just like that one game that Konami put out.

1487
01:56:30,683 --> 01:56:30,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember?

1488
01:56:31,304 --> 01:56:32,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember that, I remember that.

1489
01:56:32,345 --> 01:56:33,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Dewey's Adventure?

1490
01:56:33,305 --> 01:56:33,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1491
01:56:34,786 --> 01:56:36,848

[SPEAKER_05]: Arrow Porter and Crimson Shroud are also on the table to be released by the end of the year.

1496
01:57:01,282 --> 01:57:03,343
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1497
01:57:03,803 --> 01:57:08,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, some 3DS titles that are full games that are now available for download.

[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64 3D, Mario Kart 7, all coming on October 18th for $39.99 each.

1499
01:57:18,747 --> 01:57:23,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of those you can start to find in the bargain bins for far cheaper, so be careful, I'm just saying.

1500
01:57:23,649 --> 01:57:27,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's nice to Nintendo to offer such bargains on that stuff.

1501
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:27,770

1505
01:57:53,177 --> 01:57:53,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1506
01:57:54,398 --> 01:57:57,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Some characters might set up a tent and camp outside.

1507
01:57:59,080 --> 01:58:02,022
[SPEAKER_05]: You can help your in-game friends with purchasing decisions.

1508
01:58:03,102 --> 01:58:06,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Use your office as the mayor to make decisions on putting things in town.

1510
01:58:12,987 --> 01:58:15,729
[SPEAKER_05]: A megaphone lets you gather people.

1511
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got something to say.

1512
01:58:19,298 --> 01:58:22,040
[SPEAKER_05]: There's now a shoe store, a museum store.

1513
01:58:23,321 --> 01:58:25,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Shrunk will be back at the club.

1514
01:58:26,523 --> 01:58:28,524

01:58:29,285 --> 01:58:34,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You can view the homes of people you street pass and trade items with people you street pass.

[SPEAKER_05]: You can take a picture with a photo booth.

1517
01:58:38,191 --> 01:58:43,155
[SPEAKER_05]: There's now a massage parlor that will relax you and put you into a dream stage.

1518
01:58:44,576 --> 01:58:47,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is leading into Animal Crossing Happy Endings.

1519
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:48,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Be the next game.

1520
01:58:48,601 --> 01:58:48,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

1521
01:58:49,782 --> 01:58:51,865
[SPEAKER_05]: You can explore the town of someone else.

1522
01:58:52,846 --> 01:58:54,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Thought you could do that in the last one on the Wii.

1523
01:58:55,169 --> 01:58:55,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't do that.

1524
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:58,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can do that with How to Invitation or something?

1525
01:58:58,473 --> 01:58:58,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

1526
01:58:59,774 --> 01:59:00,134
[SPEAKER_05]: K.K.

1527
01:59:00,174 --> 01:59:04,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Slider will also be the DJ at the club as well as playing the guitar.

1528
01:59:04,776 --> 01:59:05,597
[SPEAKER_05]: More K.K.

1529
01:59:05,657 --> 01:59:06,057
[SPEAKER_05]: songs.

1530
01:59:07,138 --> 01:59:09,219
[SPEAKER_05]: You can explore a town with other people.

1531
01:59:09,819 --> 01:59:13,541
[SPEAKER_05]: You can take the boat to the island, grab items from the bottom of the sea.

1532
01:59:13,981 --> 01:59:17,562
[SPEAKER_05]: There's mini games and various stores when you visit the island by boat.

1533
01:59:19,123 --> 01:59:24,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Tortimer is the host of minigames and wears a tropical shirt, so it sounds like the former mayor is retired to the island.

1534
01:59:24,687 --> 01:59:25,467
[SPEAKER_05]: And not dead.

1535
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:26,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And not dead.

1536
01:59:27,689 --> 01:59:31,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And one minigame has you navigating a maze to collect a certain item.

1537
01:59:32,451 --> 01:59:33,992
[SPEAKER_05]: What a profound and new concept.

1538
01:59:34,493 --> 01:59:35,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Maze navigation.

1539
01:59:35,513 --> 01:59:37,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of that in a video game.

1540
01:59:42,017 --> 01:59:46,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in chat asks, can you still hit animals over the head with the bug catching net?

1541
01:59:46,879 --> 01:59:49,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so or this whole fucking game is invalidated, isn't it?

1542
01:59:50,221 --> 01:59:55,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you drag animals into an abandoned house and set up a saw style trap system for them?

1543
01:59:56,423 --> 01:59:57,263
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

1544
01:59:57,404 --> 01:59:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying this game.

1545
01:59:58,940 --> 01:59:59,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so wrong.

1546
02:00:21,773 --> 02:00:32,303
[SPEAKER_05]: yet so right yet so right I think that's worthy enough of being a dream game to be honest Animal Crossing after dark but I'm pretty sure we've talked about something like that before Animal Crossing the line

1547
02:00:34,215 --> 02:00:35,676
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, what do you got next?

1548
02:00:36,316 --> 02:00:39,517
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so next thing I've got, this is pretty cool.

1549
02:00:41,898 --> 02:00:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would you say, and I completely forgot about this until I saw the article.

1550
02:00:46,881 --> 02:00:50,442
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember, no doubt, in Activision, there was a little lawsuit there.

1551
02:00:50,462 --> 02:00:51,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I remember this.

1552
02:00:51,122 --> 02:00:58,205
[SPEAKER_04]: They were suing because, you know, people were singing other songs that they shouldn't have been singing, you know, didn't like it.

1553
02:00:58,446 --> 02:01:01,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, shock, settle that in court.

1554
02:01:01,887 --> 02:01:03,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, you don't say.

1555
02:01:03,829 --> 02:01:06,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Another lawsuit in the gaming industry settled out of court.

1556
02:01:06,512 --> 02:01:07,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Get out now.

1557
02:01:08,134 --> 02:01:08,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1558
02:01:09,656 --> 02:01:10,237
[SPEAKER_04]: They've settled.

1559
02:01:10,998 --> 02:01:11,378
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1560
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:14,842
[SPEAKER_04]: No word on the settlement.

1561
02:01:15,002 --> 02:01:17,104
[SPEAKER_05]: As usual, no word on who got what.

1562
02:01:17,385 --> 02:01:17,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1563
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:22,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

1564
02:01:22,642 --> 02:01:24,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1565
02:01:25,643 --> 02:01:31,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com We dive into the mailbag and pick out a few emails that we think we should read on air.

1566
02:01:32,746 --> 02:01:34,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's open up the mailbag.

1567
02:01:36,068 --> 02:01:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1568
02:01:36,608 --> 02:01:38,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1569
02:01:39,509 --> 02:01:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the emails?

1570
02:01:40,329 --> 02:01:40,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1571
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:41,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1572
02:01:43,825 --> 02:01:46,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's no emails in the mailbag this week.

1573
02:01:47,271 --> 02:01:50,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if DarkSakura was here, there'd be nothing to read.

1574
02:01:51,459 --> 02:01:52,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Womp womp.

1575
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:54,331
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1576
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:38,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, why don't you start?

1577
02:02:38,934 --> 02:02:41,320
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have an FU of the week.

1578
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:44,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess an FU to not being able to play Borderlands 2.

1579
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play that this week.

1580
02:02:48,403 --> 02:02:51,145
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week goes to the listeners for not sending us any email.

1581
02:02:51,825 --> 02:02:56,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you voted for us in one of the podcast award things, then you're forgiven if you did that, I suppose.

1582
02:02:56,888 --> 02:02:58,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But FU to that.

1583
02:02:59,389 --> 02:03:00,850
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a not so serious FU.

1584
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:07,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I would say an FU to just all the money I've spent on this rocky project.

1585
02:03:08,314 --> 02:03:10,976
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty disgusting, but you know what?

1586
02:03:11,436 --> 02:03:14,938
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a community I really love, and I'm excited to see it back in town.

1587
02:03:14,998 --> 02:03:21,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So just F you to nerves and the realization that, like, oh my god, this is happening in, like, five days.

1588
02:03:21,702 --> 02:03:25,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I'm just, like, freaking out a little bit, but it'll be good.

1589
02:03:26,445 --> 02:03:26,925
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be good.

1590
02:03:28,206 --> 02:03:28,586
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be good.

1591
02:03:30,751 --> 02:03:36,854
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get to a couple more news stories, then we'll take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1592
02:03:37,234 --> 02:03:37,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1593
02:03:37,954 --> 02:03:47,999
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so now we talked about it last week, how there was the oh, so wonderful promotion that Microsoft is doing tied with your gamer score where you got a 1% or 2% kickback.

1594
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:49,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo!

1595
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:50,500
[SPEAKER_04]: 1% kickback.

1596
02:03:50,841 --> 02:03:52,181
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fantastic.

1597
02:03:52,721 --> 02:03:53,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Sony...

1598
02:03:54,022 --> 02:03:58,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Side to up the deal a little bit because, you know, they think 1% is not necessarily good enough.

1599
02:03:58,866 --> 02:03:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's what they're going to do.

1600
02:04:00,807 --> 02:04:10,214
[SPEAKER_04]: They announced that apparently if you buy $100 or more in October, you're going to get a $20 voucher for the PlayStation Network in November.

1601
02:04:12,136 --> 02:04:12,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.

1602
02:04:13,176 --> 02:04:14,757
[SPEAKER_05]: That's enough to buy Tokyo Jungle.

1603
02:04:15,338 --> 02:04:18,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of games online, actually.

1604
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:18,660
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 20%.

1605
02:04:19,141 --> 02:04:20,562
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 10 times better than 2%.

1606
02:04:21,122 --> 02:04:23,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the money I spend on PlayStation Plus count towards that?

1607
02:04:28,037 --> 02:04:28,197
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1608
02:04:29,778 --> 02:04:32,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they said just on PlayStation Network, so maybe?

1609
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that would count?

1610
02:04:35,621 --> 02:04:42,544
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you can buy... I mean, I think it's kind of to push you a little bit to... And this is kind of cool.

1611
02:04:42,564 --> 02:04:46,666
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're thinking on the fence about the digital stuff, remember you can buy those digital games.

1612
02:04:46,746 --> 02:04:51,288
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have PlayStation Plus, you get 10% off of the digital games, plus you get $20 back.

1613
02:04:51,348 --> 02:04:56,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could really cut down the cost of these new release games if you're interested in picking up about $100 worth of product.

1614
02:04:57,231 --> 02:04:57,331
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1615
02:04:58,012 --> 02:05:04,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, I got 20 Microsoft points for my birthday from Microsoft.

1616
02:05:05,555 --> 02:05:07,176
[SPEAKER_05]: A whole 20 points?

1617
02:05:07,816 --> 02:05:09,237
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a whole quarter.

1618
02:05:09,757 --> 02:05:10,558
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what your birthday is.

1619
02:05:10,598 --> 02:05:11,678
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the quarter.

1620
02:05:11,978 --> 02:05:13,899
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the special birthday thing was.

1621
02:05:14,579 --> 02:05:15,860
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 Microsoft points.

1622
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:17,041
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that will buy?

1623
02:05:17,501 --> 02:05:17,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

1624
02:05:17,821 --> 02:05:19,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a goddamn thing.

1625
02:05:20,042 --> 02:05:22,003
[SPEAKER_04]: All that will do is that will bug you.

1626
02:05:22,783 --> 02:05:26,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be like someone went into your house in the middle of the night.

1627
02:05:27,766 --> 02:05:31,947
[SPEAKER_04]: and plucked out one of those pixels in your TV and made it not work.

1628
02:05:32,087 --> 02:05:36,169
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just going to fucking bother you because you're going to have 20 points left over.

1629
02:05:36,189 --> 02:05:38,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, fuck, I can't buy anything with these 20 points.

1630
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:40,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to purchase more points to buy stuff.

1631
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:51,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just going to drive you crazy until you put more money in and then still end up with 120 points left over or some other freaking multiple of something you'll never be able to spend.

1632
02:05:51,354 --> 02:05:55,315
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy, according to Dark Tetsuya, you could buy one quarter of Bungie Ferret Tossing.

1633
02:05:56,946 --> 02:06:01,390
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a $1 game and a great deal on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace right now.

1634
02:06:03,952 --> 02:06:04,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

1635
02:06:04,873 --> 02:06:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Microsoft, you're so generous.

1636
02:06:06,214 --> 02:06:07,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So $20 does sound a lot better.

1637
02:06:07,735 --> 02:06:08,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't even give you a buck.

1638
02:06:08,696 --> 02:06:10,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I can give you a dollar.

1639
02:06:10,617 --> 02:06:11,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fake money.

1640
02:06:13,929 --> 02:06:20,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, $100 on the PlayStation Marketplace, that seems like a lot of money to spend, but... If you're buying new release games.

1641
02:06:20,356 --> 02:06:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1642
02:06:20,796 --> 02:06:22,498
[SPEAKER_05]: All it takes is two new release games, right?

1643
02:06:22,939 --> 02:06:27,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even one new release game and maybe three PlayStation Network games to get you there.

1644
02:06:28,745 --> 02:06:31,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if PlayStation Plus dollars count towards that.

1645
02:06:32,049 --> 02:06:32,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

1646
02:06:33,890 --> 02:06:55,488
[SPEAKER_05]: um if you have PlayStation Plus or if you buy PlayStation Plus if you buy PlayStation Plus uh maybe like maybe maybe this is my month to renew uh I don't know maybe I'd be interested to know that to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase quarter

1647
02:06:55,854 --> 02:07:02,996
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line for calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1648
02:07:03,376 --> 02:07:12,519
[SPEAKER_05]: This doesn't have to do with gaming per se, but I think this is a good story because obviously gaming owes a lot of thanks to this, and that is the anniversary that we celebrate this week.

1649
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:19,341
[SPEAKER_05]: The compact disc turns 30, or the CD is now 30 years old.

1650
02:07:19,741 --> 02:07:22,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Loki, you and I are older than the CD.

1651
02:07:24,022 --> 02:07:24,962
[SPEAKER_05]: The CD was a joint effort of Philips and Sony.

1652
02:07:24,982 --> 02:07:27,043
[SPEAKER_05]: They were working independently on different versions of the technology in the 70s.

1653
02:07:45,331 --> 02:07:55,415
[SPEAKER_05]: and they started to come out right in June of 1985 was when the CD-ROM was really born and that, of course, led to where we're at now.

1654
02:07:56,015 --> 02:08:04,799
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, without the CD, we would never have had the PlayStation era or really arguably DVDs and Blu-ray and all the stuff we have now.

1655
02:08:04,839 --> 02:08:08,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, DVDs and Blu-rays still are shaped like a CD.

1656
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:09,881
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1657
02:08:11,181 --> 02:08:23,239
[SPEAKER_05]: and of course it was a great sound remember the whole big thing about it was like you can skip right to tracks like no more rewinding and fast forwarding I think you could skip to tracks on 8 tracks but you still had to rewind them at some point

1658
02:08:25,638 --> 02:08:28,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remembered the giant buttons that were 1, 2, 3, and 4.

1659
02:08:30,099 --> 02:08:30,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.

1660
02:08:30,659 --> 02:08:32,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this leads to a great question in chat.

1661
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:34,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I love where Tigerclaw is going for this.

1662
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:37,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line and we'll tackle this question.

1663
02:08:37,180 --> 02:08:40,141
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1664
02:08:41,021 --> 02:08:48,323
[SPEAKER_05]: While we wait for some calls, Tigerclaw in chat says, Do you guys remember the first CD you ever bought and still have?

1665
02:08:49,063 --> 02:08:53,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw says, My very first CD was the Too Unlimited album called No Limit.

1666
02:08:55,521 --> 02:08:56,082
[SPEAKER_05]: VIRGIN MEGA STORE

1667
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what my first CD was.

1668
02:09:21,425 --> 02:09:23,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I sorta remember my first CD player.

1669
02:09:24,350 --> 02:09:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a tape adapter for my car.

1670
02:09:28,377 --> 02:09:30,380
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I don't even remember what my first CD was.

1671
02:09:31,846 --> 02:09:36,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, I don't really have a first CD because I bought two CDs when I first went.

1672
02:09:37,951 --> 02:09:41,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of them was the soundtrack to The Addams Family, which came out that year.

1673
02:09:42,255 --> 02:09:43,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that movie.

1674
02:09:43,316 --> 02:09:45,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought that even though it was mostly orchestral.

1675
02:09:46,098 --> 02:09:46,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember having that.

1676
02:09:47,279 --> 02:09:49,281
[SPEAKER_05]: But then here you go.

1677
02:09:49,321 --> 02:09:49,921
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready for this?

1678
02:09:49,982 --> 02:09:51,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It was another soundtrack.

1679
02:09:51,223 --> 02:09:54,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's one of my big gay moments.

1680
02:09:54,345 --> 02:09:55,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You ready?

1681
02:09:55,786 --> 02:09:58,409
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my first CDs was the soundtrack to Sister Act.

1682
02:09:58,429 --> 02:09:58,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1683
02:09:59,741 --> 02:10:06,544
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, the Whoopi Goldberg classic was one of the first CDs I ever owned.

1684
02:10:07,944 --> 02:10:14,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't still have them though, which is kind of tragic because I got rid of all my CDs during one of my moves.

1685
02:10:14,626 --> 02:10:15,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So, kind of sad.

1686
02:10:16,427 --> 02:10:19,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's see, I'm going to, uh, the chat to check out some of these answers.

1687
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:24,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, DJ Dark Knight says, my first ever CD was Dr. Dre, The Chronic.

1688
02:10:24,852 --> 02:10:26,453
[SPEAKER_05]: See, there's nothing to be embarrassed about there.

1689
02:10:26,613 --> 02:10:27,334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a classic album.

1690
02:10:27,354 --> 02:10:30,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, I remember what my first CDs were, because they weren't actually my CDs.

1691
02:10:30,896 --> 02:10:33,778
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents, they bought a new stereo system that had a CD player.

1692
02:10:34,258 --> 02:10:38,981
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had, uh, one of the first CDs we had was, uh...

1693
02:10:41,004 --> 02:10:41,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael Jackson, Black and White.

1694
02:10:43,465 --> 02:10:43,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1695
02:10:44,385 --> 02:10:46,206
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like a landmark song when that came out.

1696
02:10:46,466 --> 02:10:47,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, our Skype line is open.

1697
02:10:47,706 --> 02:10:49,226
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1698
02:10:49,266 --> 02:10:50,547
[SPEAKER_04]: That album wasn't Black and White.

1699
02:10:50,887 --> 02:10:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it called?

1700
02:10:51,607 --> 02:10:52,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Dangerous.

1701
02:10:52,107 --> 02:10:52,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Dangerous, yes.

1702
02:10:52,868 --> 02:10:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Dangerous.

1703
02:10:53,248 --> 02:10:54,268
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

1704
02:10:54,288 --> 02:10:55,048
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1705
02:10:55,108 --> 02:10:56,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1706
02:10:56,829 --> 02:10:58,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to some embarrassing answers.

1707
02:10:58,769 --> 02:11:02,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in chat says, My first CD was the Aqua Barbie Girl single.

1708
02:11:05,014 --> 02:11:05,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

1709
02:11:06,095 --> 02:11:06,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1710
02:11:08,097 --> 02:11:11,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Ziba says, I think mine was either Ace of Base or No Doubt.

1711
02:11:12,821 --> 02:11:15,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Some answers that you can't really be embarrassed about.

1712
02:11:15,743 --> 02:11:17,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft says, my first CD was an Aerosmith album.

1713
02:11:18,385 --> 02:11:20,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Right says, Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise.

1714
02:11:22,048 --> 02:11:25,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan Alchemy remembers buying CDs for other people were the first CDs he bought.

1715
02:11:26,151 --> 02:11:32,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wayne's World soundtrack, Primus was Sailing the Seas of Cheese, Weezer's debut, and Madonna's Erotica.

1716
02:11:34,599 --> 02:11:35,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1717
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:39,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Zether says my first CD was Weird Al's The Food Album.

1718
02:11:40,788 --> 02:11:41,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1719
02:11:43,914 --> 02:11:46,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I need to load up the Twitter.

1720
02:11:46,255 --> 02:11:49,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot to get out my iPad, so I guess I'll have to do this the regular way.

1721
02:11:49,817 --> 02:11:52,478
[SPEAKER_05]: See if there's any tweets tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.

1722
02:11:52,498 --> 02:11:54,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I know TigerClaw usually sends us a couple.

1723
02:11:54,119 --> 02:11:55,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see if there's anything else in there.

1724
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

1725
02:11:58,501 --> 02:11:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

1726
02:11:59,782 --> 02:12:00,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yikes!

1727
02:12:00,402 --> 02:12:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: At least nothing I've seen so far.

1728
02:12:03,003 --> 02:12:03,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm...

1729
02:12:09,542 --> 02:12:11,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, I got some tweets while you find it.

1730
02:12:12,183 --> 02:12:12,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1731
02:12:13,743 --> 02:12:17,225
[SPEAKER_05]: From Codeman asks, Did you guys find a host?

1732
02:12:18,505 --> 02:12:18,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1733
02:12:19,906 --> 02:12:21,946
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do the Skype host thing, but I don't know.

1734
02:12:22,006 --> 02:12:25,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, a lot of this show, you have to remember the history of this show, we've always been in one room together.

1735
02:12:26,068 --> 02:12:30,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, whereas taking calls on Skype is one thing, to have the host on Skype is weird.

1736
02:12:30,569 --> 02:12:31,289
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, anyway.

1737
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:37,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand Tiara's filled in when I'm not here, and that's different, because Jamie emcees those shows, so...

1738
02:12:38,832 --> 02:13:01,956
[SPEAKER_05]: that works out a lot better but uh yeah i don't know the not being able to see the co-host thing is is weird for me but then again horde house works okay i can't explain it i can't it's just olr's got a formula you gotta stick to it uh moving on to some tweets from tiger claw uh tiger claw oh reminds me of something that happened in world of warcraft today i did not experience this but i heard about it apparently and they're blaming this on a hacker

1739
02:13:02,276 --> 02:13:03,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just was reading that.

1740
02:13:28,187 --> 02:13:29,788
[SPEAKER_05]: and the subsequent graveyards.

1741
02:13:30,388 --> 02:13:33,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, crazy stuff.

1742
02:13:33,330 --> 02:13:39,793
[SPEAKER_05]: No official comment from Blizzard, but I will say the servers were down and then the authentication servers were down as well for quite a bit this morning.

1743
02:13:39,833 --> 02:13:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to play around 11 a.m.

1744
02:13:41,193 --> 02:13:41,654
[SPEAKER_05]: and I couldn't.

1745
02:13:42,134 --> 02:13:44,495
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think they were trying to fix this as it was happening.

1746
02:13:45,295 --> 02:13:46,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Blizzard's seen this.

1747
02:13:46,836 --> 02:13:52,519
[SPEAKER_05]: They certainly follow the fan sites and I can't believe everybody and their mother wasn't filing a complaint about the characters.

1748
02:13:52,939 --> 02:13:56,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will find the IPs and they will obliterate them.

1749
02:13:57,061 --> 02:13:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1750
02:14:17,211 --> 02:14:18,492
[SPEAKER_05]: You got shy listeners tonight.

1751
02:14:18,992 --> 02:14:20,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does the number not work?

1752
02:14:20,713 --> 02:14:23,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what's happening there.

1753
02:14:23,614 --> 02:14:24,954
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR again.

1754
02:14:25,014 --> 02:14:27,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1755
02:14:28,876 --> 02:14:32,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me make sure the number's working tonight because that was the problem last week.

1756
02:14:33,037 --> 02:14:34,738
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with this thing, man?

1757
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:38,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Angry Birds Star Wars Jenga?

1758
02:14:38,379 --> 02:14:41,080
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a three-way crossover there.

1759
02:14:43,226 --> 02:14:46,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just throw everything and see if one of them sticks.

1760
02:14:48,750 --> 02:14:50,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Star Wars needed more Angry Birds.

1761
02:14:50,872 --> 02:14:57,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we mentioned this, Atlas is publishing all the Calypso stuff now.

1762
02:14:58,257 --> 02:14:58,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1763
02:14:58,977 --> 02:14:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1764
02:15:00,058 --> 02:15:00,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that.

1765
02:15:01,759 --> 02:15:02,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of weird.

1766
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:04,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Or distributing, maybe.

1767
02:15:05,268 --> 02:15:07,731
[SPEAKER_05]: This other link here from Tigerclaw is kind of sad.

1768
02:15:07,831 --> 02:15:08,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got a call coming in.

1769
02:15:09,574 --> 02:15:10,215
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be interesting.

1770
02:15:10,255 --> 02:15:11,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the phones.

1771
02:15:12,157 --> 02:15:13,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1772
02:15:13,219 --> 02:15:13,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

1773
02:15:14,340 --> 02:15:15,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Does your Skype work yet?

1774
02:15:15,462 --> 02:15:16,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it works.

1775
02:15:16,784 --> 02:15:20,329
[SPEAKER_05]: I called it from my phone and just verified the 800 number was working.

1776
02:15:22,100 --> 02:15:22,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's working.

1777
02:15:23,141 --> 02:15:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Bobby.

1778
02:15:23,821 --> 02:15:24,662
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your opening act.

1779
02:15:24,802 --> 02:15:27,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, our co-headliner.

1780
02:15:27,803 --> 02:15:28,844
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Bobby Blackwolf?

1781
02:15:29,204 --> 02:15:29,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

1782
02:15:31,525 --> 02:15:36,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in your position where I'm sitting there asking for calls, so I figured I'd help you guys out.

1783
02:15:36,488 --> 02:15:37,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

1784
02:15:37,969 --> 02:15:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: You've always been very good.

1785
02:15:40,150 --> 02:15:42,592
[SPEAKER_05]: You've literally had us on every episode of your show.

1786
02:15:43,012 --> 02:15:45,354
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1787
02:16:03,351 --> 02:16:03,871
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

1788
02:16:03,911 --> 02:16:08,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at Siege this weekend, which is the Southern Interactive Entertainment and Game Expo.

1789
02:16:08,773 --> 02:16:11,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of it more like GDC rather than E3.

1790
02:16:12,295 --> 02:16:16,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was basically, you know, a lot of students were there about getting into the industry and things like that.

1791
02:16:16,997 --> 02:16:17,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really interesting.

1792
02:16:17,817 --> 02:16:19,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to meet a lot of great indie artists.

1793
02:16:20,658 --> 02:16:28,882
[SPEAKER_02]: and developers primarily here in the southeast and hopefully lined up some stuff for us to cover in the future here at VOG.

1794
02:16:29,383 --> 02:16:32,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited about that and a lot of people are really excited about VOG.

1795
02:16:32,424 --> 02:16:37,967
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the first times I've really pushed VOG as a network really hard on people.

1796
02:16:38,187 --> 02:16:39,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of our first times in print.

1797
02:16:39,808 --> 02:16:43,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw the tweet with the little logo in the flyer.

1798
02:16:43,330 --> 02:16:46,131
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the program.

1799
02:16:46,151 --> 02:16:49,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually the program that everybody got and probably didn't read.

1800
02:16:50,601 --> 02:16:51,842
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens, that's alright.

1801
02:16:52,062 --> 02:16:54,985
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually they all did read it because that had the schedule of all the panels.

1802
02:16:55,266 --> 02:16:58,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And I heard the VOG logo was above the Microsoft logo.

1803
02:16:58,569 --> 02:16:59,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1804
02:16:59,190 --> 02:16:59,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

1805
02:17:00,251 --> 02:17:00,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1806
02:17:00,731 --> 02:17:01,992
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming for you, Gates.

1807
02:17:02,493 --> 02:17:03,074
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1808
02:17:03,334 --> 02:17:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a pretty neat interview tonight on your show.

1809
02:17:07,206 --> 02:17:09,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight I was talking to Dustin Klingman.

1810
02:17:09,468 --> 02:17:15,153
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the chairman of the International Game Developers Association.

1811
02:17:15,253 --> 02:17:17,896
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about that I've done some interesting episodes.

1812
02:17:17,916 --> 02:17:21,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started trying to theme what I'm doing instead of just talking about the news.

1813
02:17:21,799 --> 02:17:27,544
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a theme I can do, and if it's more like a discussion topic, I'll talk about it.

1814
02:17:27,644 --> 02:17:32,948
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple weeks ago, I did a whole theme on people getting laid off.

1815
02:17:33,735 --> 02:17:36,018
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm tired of talking about people getting laid off.

1816
02:17:36,519 --> 02:17:40,844
[SPEAKER_02]: He did his keynote speech at Siege about a time for optimism.

1817
02:17:41,787 --> 02:18:04,371
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was talking about how you should be optimistic about the game industry in spite of and he actually put out 120 studios have closed in the last 5 or 6 years that's the official number 120 have closed in the last 5 or 6 years and all this stuff people are leaving Zynga's stock price dropped and he did this entire keynote about why you should still be optimistic

1818
02:18:05,594 --> 02:18:11,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I interviewed him and basically tried to distill his one-hour keynote into a little 25-minute interview.

1819
02:18:11,686 --> 02:18:14,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But I basically asked him, why should we be optimistic?

1820
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:17,171
[SPEAKER_02]: and just let him talk.

1821
02:18:17,552 --> 02:18:20,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the questions you asked him was about the video game Crash as well.

1822
02:18:21,055 --> 02:18:25,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And you kind of asked, do you think we'll see something like we saw in the early 80s happen again?

1823
02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:26,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said no.

1824
02:18:26,641 --> 02:18:28,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had his reasons.

1825
02:18:28,864 --> 02:18:33,449
[SPEAKER_05]: As a consumer, I'm not sure I necessarily agreed with everything he said.

1826
02:18:33,749 --> 02:18:34,390
[SPEAKER_05]: But I get the...

1827
02:18:35,811 --> 02:18:43,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I get the optimism and the fact that, you know, kind of like for every door that closes another opens and that there's this whole mobile thing is now the fad, I guess.

1828
02:18:44,056 --> 02:18:48,059
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we're seeing kind of like less AAA things and more mobile things.

1829
02:18:48,579 --> 02:18:49,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

1830
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:57,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of wonder, like, part of the reason the Atari 2600 and all that collapsed was that you had this oversaturation of these little...

1831
02:18:57,825 --> 02:19:03,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Games, although granted they were charging full price for them at the time and mobile games are more in the $0.99, $2 size.

1832
02:19:04,573 --> 02:19:12,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And his thing was that the reason also the crash happened is because stores just stopped wanting to carry them because they couldn't return them.

1833
02:19:13,158 --> 02:19:13,979
[SPEAKER_02]: The Evil G doesn't sell.

1834
02:19:29,385 --> 02:19:29,805
[SPEAKER_02]: NautiBear2

1835
02:19:47,463 --> 02:19:48,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me jump in with Loki.

1836
02:19:48,483 --> 02:19:52,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, the man who works for the distribution company, you say that's not totally true.

1837
02:19:52,044 --> 02:19:52,365
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true.

1838
02:19:52,385 --> 02:19:53,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all one-way sale.

1839
02:19:53,805 --> 02:19:55,085
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not allow returns.

1840
02:19:56,726 --> 02:19:58,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that maybe just your arrangement?

1841
02:19:58,666 --> 02:20:00,607
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it's mass retailers.

1842
02:20:00,707 --> 02:20:08,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason why they do that, that's why they do a pre-order program because otherwise they can buy a bunch of stuff and then return it all.

1843
02:20:08,309 --> 02:20:09,430
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all one way.

1844
02:20:09,730 --> 02:20:12,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what it is now is they get a lot more perks.

1845
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:16,972
[SPEAKER_04]: They get a lot more back-end rebates and a lot of price protections and all that fun stuff.

1846
02:20:17,572 --> 02:20:41,280
[SPEAKER_04]: but uh no it's definitely there are no returns on that stuff because the publishers do not want to be sitting on that stuff interesting and is that why amazon isn't that part of the like the rumors why amazon stopped carrying a lot of the nintendo stuff right the hardware uh well defectives are a little different but yeah once again you have to usually what they'll do with the effectives is they'll want the cut the consumer to go through the proper routes through the publishers but

1847
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:48,105
[SPEAKER_04]: or the hardware manufacturers like, you know, they want a person that buys an Xbox 360 to go to Microsoft and have that repaired it.

1848
02:20:48,505 --> 02:20:50,586
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, a consumer doesn't care.

1849
02:20:50,606 --> 02:20:52,948
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, well, why did GameStop sell me a defective system?

1850
02:20:52,968 --> 02:20:58,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go back to GameStop and return it instead of actually, you know, even if there's instructions in the box, do not return this back to the retailer.

1851
02:20:59,692 --> 02:21:07,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, all that stuff has to be approved, you know, and obviously, you know, they're going to approve GameStop over, you know, some mom-off shop.

1852
02:21:07,698 --> 02:21:10,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I knew that when I was doing the interview yesterday so I could have, like, called them out on it.

1853
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:14,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, now we'll just have to have another interview at some point.

1854
02:21:14,881 --> 02:21:16,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we'll invite him on OLR, let Loki grill him.

1855
02:21:18,263 --> 02:21:22,104
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it was a good interview, and the fact that he was pretty open.

1856
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:28,567
[SPEAKER_05]: You did have some tough questions, and that's always great when an interviewee can handle those questions.

1857
02:21:29,147 --> 02:21:31,728
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I have to ask you about something you didn't talk about.

1858
02:21:32,189 --> 02:21:32,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1859
02:21:32,569 --> 02:21:36,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But you did talk about it on Twitter, so that's why I know it's fair game, because you did post about it on Twitter.

1860
02:21:37,191 --> 02:21:40,072
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to tell me about what's happening with a certain voice actor.

1861
02:21:40,772 --> 02:21:41,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

1862
02:21:42,133 --> 02:21:42,954
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with this?

1863
02:21:43,374 --> 02:21:51,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, well, and actually I phrased it on my Facebook, my private Facebook profile a little bit better.

1864
02:21:53,322 --> 02:22:00,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, my friends on Facebook know why this is amazing a little bit more than what people on Twitter would do.

1865
02:22:00,588 --> 02:22:04,231
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tell you this, I am not the type of person to go near a dance floor.

1866
02:22:05,851 --> 02:22:18,347
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I don't you know but I like you know going to concerts and stuff so I'm you know because I'm a musician so I'm actually watching the musician and so I've actually never been really you know on a dance floor you know

1867
02:22:19,982 --> 02:22:23,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I can get out of being pulled onto a dance floor.

1868
02:22:23,284 --> 02:22:24,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And Professor Shy Guy was playing.

1869
02:22:25,325 --> 02:22:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: All those years of DDR did nothing?

1870
02:22:27,606 --> 02:22:27,826
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1871
02:22:28,366 --> 02:22:30,207
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta realize, I did an aero stomp.

1872
02:22:30,607 --> 02:22:31,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright.

1873
02:22:31,368 --> 02:22:33,208
[SPEAKER_02]: My Bimani was fingers.

1874
02:22:33,389 --> 02:22:34,409
[SPEAKER_05]: You were a Beatmania guy.

1875
02:22:34,469 --> 02:22:35,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fair enough.

1876
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:36,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1877
02:22:38,755 --> 02:22:39,675
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1878
02:22:58,762 --> 02:23:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, so she got pulled up to the dance floor by somebody.

1879
02:23:03,805 --> 02:23:04,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so I'm kind of sitting there.

1880
02:23:04,945 --> 02:23:07,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have some pictures of her dancing up there, which is great.

1881
02:23:08,387 --> 02:23:12,089
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's like, okay, everybody here go out and get somebody and Ellen McClain comes right to me.

1882
02:23:13,933 --> 02:23:28,899
[SPEAKER_02]: and she's like come on and I'm like you know I do the whole no thing and she gives me this look like the motherly you're gonna do this I said so look you and when the voice of GLaDOS comes up to you and like just kind of like stares at you

1883
02:23:29,739 --> 02:23:34,000
[SPEAKER_02]: saying you're going to do this and starts pulling, you don't resist.

1884
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't say no to GLaDOS.

1885
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:37,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't.

1886
02:23:37,661 --> 02:23:46,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I phrase it is I don't know what's more impressive, the fact that I got on a dance floor and danced for two songs or that it was by the voice of GLaDOS.

1887
02:23:47,883 --> 02:23:48,843
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great story.

1888
02:23:49,583 --> 02:23:49,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

1889
02:23:50,383 --> 02:23:52,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully, there's no video of it.

1890
02:23:54,198 --> 02:23:55,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And there never will.

1891
02:23:55,039 --> 02:23:56,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no clue what I'm doing up there.

1892
02:23:56,701 --> 02:23:57,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was trying.

1893
02:23:57,562 --> 02:23:59,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she actually like she was wearing kind of like this.

1894
02:24:00,565 --> 02:24:04,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the clothing thing is called, but it's something that she wears over her shoulders.

1895
02:24:05,010 --> 02:24:07,673
[SPEAKER_02]: She was actually using that and wrapping it around me and doing something.

1896
02:24:07,693 --> 02:24:07,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1897
02:24:08,054 --> 02:24:08,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.

1898
02:24:09,275 --> 02:24:09,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

1899
02:24:09,916 --> 02:24:11,317
[SPEAKER_02]: John Patrick Lauer, you're on notice.

1900
02:24:11,478 --> 02:24:11,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.

1901
02:24:12,919 --> 02:24:17,201
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like getting to be Dancing with the Stars level scandal right here.

1902
02:24:17,521 --> 02:24:18,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1903
02:24:18,801 --> 02:24:23,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Ellen made Black Wolf his slave for science.

1904
02:24:23,883 --> 02:24:25,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you meant her slave.

1905
02:24:25,264 --> 02:24:25,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, her.

1906
02:24:26,124 --> 02:24:26,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Her slave.

1907
02:24:26,504 --> 02:24:27,224
[SPEAKER_02]: She's definitely a woman.

1908
02:24:27,424 --> 02:24:27,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1909
02:24:28,665 --> 02:24:29,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

1910
02:24:29,505 --> 02:24:30,125
[SPEAKER_02]: For science.

1911
02:24:31,126 --> 02:24:33,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said, okay, everybody go out and get more.

1912
02:24:33,267 --> 02:24:36,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So she took me by the hand and we found two other people.

1913
02:24:38,008 --> 02:24:40,069
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she handed me off to the other woman.

1914
02:24:40,990 --> 02:24:41,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And she took the, yeah.

1915
02:24:42,486 --> 02:24:43,107
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1916
02:25:09,602 --> 02:25:10,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1917
02:25:31,124 --> 02:25:32,225
[SPEAKER_05]: GameCon Dance GameCon Dance

1918
02:25:57,882 --> 02:26:02,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I plan to walk up to her and go, and I'll just say, hey, I'm a friend of Bobby Blackwolf's.

1919
02:26:02,905 --> 02:26:03,425
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1920
02:26:04,205 --> 02:26:05,686
[SPEAKER_02]: She does know that name now.

1921
02:26:06,146 --> 02:26:07,187
[SPEAKER_02]: She does remember that.

1922
02:26:09,128 --> 02:26:11,069
[SPEAKER_02]: We've met three times, so she now knows me.

1923
02:26:11,109 --> 02:26:11,729
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1924
02:26:12,529 --> 02:26:14,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all the listeners are going to try that at a convention.

1925
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:15,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you dare.

1926
02:26:17,586 --> 02:26:20,050
[SPEAKER_02]: You could tell her that you heard her on VOG Network.

1927
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:20,791
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1928
02:26:20,931 --> 02:26:25,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she did, and I know I told you this, and we haven't started putting these on the stream.

1929
02:26:26,759 --> 02:26:31,666
[SPEAKER_02]: She did multiple bumpers for VOG on Saturday.

1930
02:26:32,747 --> 02:26:33,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

1931
02:26:33,128 --> 02:26:33,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple.

1932
02:26:33,729 --> 02:26:34,470
[SPEAKER_02]: She did three of them.

1933
02:26:35,717 --> 02:26:40,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't vote for my show, vote for Orange Lounge Radio.

1934
02:26:40,643 --> 02:26:42,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at the top of Bobby's list, I'm sure, Loki.

1935
02:26:42,204 --> 02:26:42,745
[SPEAKER_05]: You dummy.

1936
02:26:55,646 --> 02:26:57,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't ever do a bumper for me.

1937
02:26:57,467 --> 02:26:58,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bumper for VOG.

1938
02:26:59,668 --> 02:27:01,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I find I promote the whole network.

1939
02:27:01,729 --> 02:27:03,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, exactly, as we've been saying.

1940
02:27:04,210 --> 02:27:07,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you're not going to vote for us, vote VOG.

1941
02:27:07,871 --> 02:27:09,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I like the ring for that.

1942
02:27:09,992 --> 02:27:10,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote VOG.

1943
02:27:11,492 --> 02:27:12,233
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1944
02:27:12,273 --> 02:27:14,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Why didn't we think of that when it started on October 1st?

1945
02:27:14,314 --> 02:27:14,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn it.

1946
02:27:15,114 --> 02:27:16,014
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have a few days left.

1947
02:27:16,034 --> 02:27:16,855
[SPEAKER_05]: We have until the 15th.

1948
02:27:17,155 --> 02:27:19,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Frisbee in chat says, Ellen bumped for VOG.

1949
02:27:20,936 --> 02:27:21,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1950
02:27:21,917 --> 02:27:22,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

1951
02:27:22,921 --> 02:27:41,606
[SPEAKER_05]: alright well Bobby thank you for sharing your stories from SiegeCon and of course you got more interviews coming up throughout the week on your own show which I can't believe anybody who's listened to OLR at this point hasn't heard your show at one point or another but if for some crazy ass reason they have still not heard your show how can they find you Bobby?

1952
02:27:43,327 --> 02:27:50,229
[SPEAKER_02]: VOGnetwork.com is actually where I point everybody to go to my episodes now yeah we do that for Horde House and OLR too

1953
02:27:51,107 --> 02:27:51,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

02:28:04,548 --> 02:28:07,569
[SPEAKER_02]: and the upcoming coming up shows next week.

1955
02:28:07,629 --> 02:28:10,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a live interview with the game recruiter.

1956
02:28:11,551 --> 02:28:14,273
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually is the CEO of GameRecruiter.com, Mark Mencher.

1957
02:28:14,933 --> 02:28:23,097
[SPEAKER_02]: He is going to be taking live chat questions as well about getting into the industry, but I'm also going to ask him how you can stay at your job and what needs to happen to stop all these layoffs.

1958
02:28:23,597 --> 02:28:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't know I'm going to ask him that yet, but I'm going to run it by him.

1959
02:28:27,780 --> 02:28:50,099
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I've got a couple pre-recorded interviews I'm going to be playing throughout the next couple weeks Tom Buscaglia who is the game attorney so we have the game recruiter and then the next week the game attorney from GameAttorney.com he mostly works he's mostly general counsel to a lot of independent game developers and indie game developers and he works with

[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1962
02:29:38,666 --> 02:29:39,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1963

[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all the fun stuff coming up on the Bobby Blackwolf show.

1964
02:29:43,167 --> 02:29:46,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully I'll be doing more themed stuff as well.

1965
02:29:47,308 --> 02:29:48,929
[SPEAKER_05]: What big interviews do we have coming up, Loki?

1966
02:29:49,349 --> 02:29:52,470
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we have to compete with Bobby here on Orange Laundry?

1967
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:54,631
[SPEAKER_05]: What big interviews have we landed for the rest of the year?

1968
02:29:56,531 --> 02:29:56,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1969
02:29:57,011 --> 02:30:01,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, next week we've got Cliffy B and Miyamoto's the week after that.

1970
02:30:03,733 --> 02:30:06,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I do want to, can I throw one more thing in?

1971
02:30:06,075 --> 02:30:06,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I take one more minute?

1972
02:30:07,176 --> 02:30:07,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose.

1973
02:30:08,397 --> 02:30:18,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so when I got there Friday, I saw the Microsoft booth, and it was the Windows 8 developer booth, and, you know, the guy behind it, and I was like, so, what do you do?

1974
02:30:18,324 --> 02:30:23,468
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, oh, I'm the developer evangelist for Windows mobile programming and Windows 8 programming and blah, blah, blah.

1975
02:30:23,488 --> 02:30:26,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, so can I ask you something about Xbox Live Indie games?

1976
02:30:27,771 --> 02:30:27,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

1977
02:30:28,171 --> 02:30:28,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, sure.

1978
02:30:28,892 --> 02:30:28,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1979
02:30:29,898 --> 02:30:32,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, so, blah, blah, blah, prepaid codes, blah, blah, blah.

1980
02:30:32,719 --> 02:30:36,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And I basically go through the whole thing about the prepaid codes that I know you guys covered as well.

1981
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:38,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I hadn't heard of that.

1982
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:40,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that like a developer here that's having problems?

1983
02:30:40,481 --> 02:30:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, it's every developer.

1984
02:30:42,021 --> 02:30:43,842
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the entirety of the internet.

1985
02:30:44,102 --> 02:30:44,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1986
02:30:45,262 --> 02:30:52,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I have not heard of that, but if you give me more information about it, I will start an email chain inside Microsoft.

1987
02:30:52,244 --> 02:30:53,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay.

1988
02:30:53,105 --> 02:30:57,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found his Twitter, and I tweeted him the link to our article, and I'm like, it's been three weeks and counting.

1989
02:30:59,428 --> 02:31:11,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually got a comment on our site from one of the other independent developers that actually posted a statement about how he's stopping support for all Microsoft platforms until they fix the prepaid code issue.

1990
02:31:11,277 --> 02:31:14,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying VOG Network may save Xbox Live Indie games?

1991
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:15,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

1992
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:16,341
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.

1993
02:31:17,264 --> 02:31:19,265
[SPEAKER_02]: because nobody else writing about this except me.

1994
02:31:19,685 --> 02:31:19,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird.

1995
02:31:20,726 --> 02:31:22,066
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got Reddit love from it.

1996
02:31:22,807 --> 02:31:23,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

1997
02:31:23,867 --> 02:31:32,672
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Bobby, we should let you go to see if anybody else is going to take a chance on calling in tonight, but I'm really glad you did have an opportunity, whatever the reason, to come on the show and plug all the good stuff you're doing right now.

1998
02:31:33,612 --> 02:31:35,133
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to test your Skype, actually.

1999
02:31:35,293 --> 02:31:35,893
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, it works.

2000
02:31:35,913 --> 02:31:37,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the pop filters.

2001
02:31:38,106 --> 02:31:38,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2002
02:31:38,406 --> 02:31:38,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, do you?

2003
02:31:39,406 --> 02:31:39,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2004
02:31:39,927 --> 02:31:44,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the new stuff, our new toys, we all have the same mic now, too.

2005
02:31:44,268 --> 02:31:49,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that was out there before, but we used to have three different microphones, two different types of connections.

2006
02:31:49,270 --> 02:31:52,951
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all different, but now everything is the same.

2007
02:31:53,351 --> 02:31:54,112
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are growing up.

2008
02:31:54,312 --> 02:31:56,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And a condenser mic in the studio now.

2009
02:31:56,532 --> 02:31:56,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

2010
02:31:57,073 --> 02:31:57,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh.

2011
02:31:57,493 --> 02:31:59,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that for the voiceover in the intro.

2012
02:31:59,153 --> 02:32:00,254
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it sounds a little different.

2013
02:32:01,214 --> 02:32:01,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2014
02:32:01,714 --> 02:32:01,934
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2015
02:32:02,254 --> 02:32:02,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, Bobby.

2016
02:32:03,235 --> 02:32:03,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2017
02:32:03,575 --> 02:32:03,895
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2018
02:32:03,915 --> 02:32:04,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2019
02:32:05,492 --> 02:32:07,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again to Brad from PodCulture because I know he's listening.

2020
02:32:07,994 --> 02:32:08,655
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fantastic.

2021
02:32:08,975 --> 02:32:09,595
[SPEAKER_05]: What, the mics?

2022
02:32:09,755 --> 02:32:10,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2023
02:32:10,296 --> 02:32:10,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, they're great.

2024
02:32:11,437 --> 02:32:12,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus I color-coded them.

2025
02:32:12,558 --> 02:32:12,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice?

2026
02:32:13,198 --> 02:32:15,120
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the same colors that they are in the show role.

2027
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a green one, you have a blue one, and she's going to have a pink one.

2028
02:32:17,882 --> 02:32:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

2029
02:32:19,163 --> 02:32:20,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Which she'll hate, but oh well.

2030
02:32:20,864 --> 02:32:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we need to get the fancy, like you know how they have the blocks on there that have the network logo and stuff?

2031
02:32:26,609 --> 02:32:27,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we could do that.

2032
02:32:29,011 --> 02:32:30,372
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cheesy and stuff, but sure.

2033
02:32:31,492 --> 02:32:36,755
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2034
02:32:37,415 --> 02:32:40,356
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing, I got to find the stand for this condenser mic.

2035
02:32:40,416 --> 02:32:41,457
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent everything.

2036
02:32:41,477 --> 02:32:43,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to find my old condenser mic.

2037
02:32:43,458 --> 02:32:45,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a condenser mic somewhere.

2038
02:32:45,379 --> 02:32:46,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know where the hell it is.

2039
02:32:46,599 --> 02:32:47,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

2040
02:32:47,340 --> 02:32:49,961
[SPEAKER_05]: That condenser mic and this condenser mic both have the same problem.

2041
02:32:50,001 --> 02:32:52,282
[SPEAKER_05]: They have crazy ass gain on them.

2042
02:32:52,822 --> 02:32:53,563
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2043
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:19,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the good news is, because he sent us all those mics, these mics aren't bad that we have, so it'll be a great mobile kit so we can set up a better way to do OLR on the go.

2044
02:33:19,345 --> 02:33:24,868
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll give it one more chance for calls, and then I'm going to shut it down and close out the show.

2045
02:33:24,888 --> 02:33:28,270
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2046
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:32,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have another tweet topic that Tiger Claw sent.

2047
02:33:33,152 --> 02:33:35,153
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a great story, though.

2048
02:33:35,193 --> 02:33:38,115
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of one of those, this is really unfortunate, but I will...

2049
02:33:38,975 --> 02:33:40,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go ahead and share it with you guys here.

2050
02:33:41,098 --> 02:33:42,700
[SPEAKER_05]: This is somewhat local, too.

2051
02:33:42,740 --> 02:33:48,727
[SPEAKER_05]: This happened in Hercules, California, which is one of those towns you pass going to the Bay Area before you hit the Bay Bridge in Oakland and all that.

2052
02:33:49,228 --> 02:33:55,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, unfortunately, the mother of Neversoft concept artist Simon Coe was murdered.

2053
02:33:55,896 --> 02:33:57,016
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really tragic.

2054
02:33:57,877 --> 02:34:07,319
[SPEAKER_05]: ABC News 7 was reporting that Susie Ko was found in her home Friday evening while the family's sky-blue 2011 Subaru Outback is also missing.

2055
02:34:07,659 --> 02:34:09,920
[SPEAKER_05]: The police have no motive or suspects in the death.

2056
02:34:10,220 --> 02:34:17,042
[SPEAKER_05]: They are asking anyone in the area with information to call the police 510-724-1111.

2057
02:34:17,102 --> 02:34:18,402
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very tragic.

2058
02:34:18,442 --> 02:34:19,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really sorry to hear about that.

2059
02:34:20,483 --> 02:34:23,004
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a call coming in, so let's take the call.

2060
02:34:23,064 --> 02:34:24,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2061
02:34:24,104 --> 02:34:24,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2062
02:34:25,626 --> 02:34:26,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's Actdeft.

2063
02:34:26,647 --> 02:34:27,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Actdeft.

2064
02:34:27,387 --> 02:34:28,087
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2065
02:34:29,948 --> 02:34:30,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing much.

2066
02:34:31,149 --> 02:34:36,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also trying to call you earlier to test your Skype, but it seems it works.

2067
02:34:37,312 --> 02:34:38,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, it works.

2068
02:34:38,513 --> 02:34:39,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Hooray.

2069
02:34:39,173 --> 02:34:41,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what have you been playing lately?

2070
02:34:42,635 --> 02:34:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I do have a topic in mind.

2071
02:34:46,537 --> 02:34:46,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

2072
02:34:46,757 --> 02:34:49,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with a game that came today.

2073
02:34:49,678 --> 02:34:51,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

2074
02:34:51,499 --> 02:34:52,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Pokemon.

2075
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:54,241
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has gotten...

2076
02:34:55,436 --> 02:34:58,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Reviews below 8, but it hasn't been below 7.

2077
02:34:59,399 --> 02:35:02,361
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around the 7th or 8th mark.

2078
02:35:03,402 --> 02:35:10,707
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that has bugged me since I started reading and probably writing reviews.

2079
02:35:13,149 --> 02:35:17,753
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that any game below 8 is automatically bad.

2080
02:35:18,673 --> 02:35:19,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stable like that.

2081
02:35:21,047 --> 02:35:21,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think that is?

2082
02:35:23,811 --> 02:35:25,154
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why.

2083
02:35:25,174 --> 02:35:30,963
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that the whole internet is like, oh my god, it got a 7, it's bad.

2084
02:35:31,684 --> 02:35:32,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand that.

2085
02:35:34,128 --> 02:35:34,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't get it.

2086
02:35:36,104 --> 02:35:39,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what leads to this whole artificial inflation of gamer scores, too.

2087
02:35:39,887 --> 02:35:41,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about the Xbox kind.

2088
02:35:41,148 --> 02:35:42,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about review scores.

2089
02:35:42,729 --> 02:35:47,433
[SPEAKER_05]: An average game, an okay game, should be a 5, shouldn't it?

2090
02:35:47,993 --> 02:35:49,895
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's really not the way it is.

2091
02:35:50,035 --> 02:35:52,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Average games in this day and age tend to get a 7.

2092
02:35:52,337 --> 02:35:54,198
[SPEAKER_05]: If you give a game a 5, it's a stinker.

2093
02:35:54,658 --> 02:36:02,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why at VOG Network we prefer to use the grading scale that you have from high schools and stuff because the A to F scale is a little more realistic.

2094
02:36:03,405 --> 02:36:06,348
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's why I think 7s also feel really harsh.

2095
02:36:07,048 --> 02:36:09,951
[SPEAKER_05]: How much are they charging for Pokemon Black 2 White 2?

2096
02:36:10,011 --> 02:36:11,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't these like $40 games?

2097
02:36:13,333 --> 02:36:14,014
[SPEAKER_05]: $35, I think.

2098
02:36:14,034 --> 02:36:14,014
$35.

2099
02:36:14,114 --> 02:36:16,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, still, that's a big chunk of change.

2100
02:36:17,097 --> 02:36:18,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a high end on a DS game.

2101
02:36:18,678 --> 02:36:23,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And most games that are reviewed for the console systems, you're talking $50, $60 games.

2102
02:36:23,562 --> 02:36:27,986
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're going to drop that much money on a game, are you going to drop $60 on something average?

2103
02:36:30,359 --> 02:36:42,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends because if the game is fun, if the game will accomplish what it's set for, to be entertaining, it should be worth it.

2104
02:36:44,214 --> 02:36:45,195
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in my opinion.

2105
02:36:46,196 --> 02:36:46,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2106
02:36:48,804 --> 02:36:49,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

2107
02:37:05,467 --> 02:37:30,518
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was telling me that there's some online title that was released That in some ways, I guess it was only three bucks in the 3DS eShop And in some ways it's better than the actual Pokemon game that came out today Just with some of the ways it's different and so forth Let me see, hopefully he won't mind if I read a little bit of the message here The relevant parts here, what is it?

2108
02:37:32,199 --> 02:37:32,819
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2109
02:37:57,433 --> 02:37:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: You get.

2110
02:37:57,953 --> 02:38:07,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So sounds like in some ways the $3 title might be providing as much value as the $35 title and that's an issue.

2111
02:38:08,045 --> 02:38:09,567
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course that's one person's opinion.

2112
02:38:10,717 --> 02:38:14,439
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like I said, it can be entertaining.

2113
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:20,383
[SPEAKER_00]: The price in this case is that you're paying for a full... It's supposed to be a full game.

2114
02:38:20,843 --> 02:38:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

2115
02:38:21,663 --> 02:38:33,950
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that you're going to be playing at least for, I don't know, 20 hours that you can probably play a Pokemon game in that time and beat it to an extent.

2116
02:38:34,771 --> 02:38:38,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do get the value of...

2117
02:38:39,994 --> 02:38:42,817
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much of a replay you're going to get.

2118
02:38:42,857 --> 02:38:53,646
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, if the game is entertaining, if you can enjoy it, then it shouldn't be labeled as bad, especially with a 7.

2119
02:38:53,707 --> 02:38:54,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be an average.

2120
02:38:55,188 --> 02:39:02,715
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do get why the game might get that score, but telling people that it's a bad game...

2121
02:39:05,305 --> 02:39:17,988
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if I were saying that a certain game, I won't name any game in particular, but, oh, it has good graphics, it has good music, and it's fun.

2122
02:39:18,488 --> 02:39:23,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but it has some very bad flaws, and it has some bugs.

2123
02:39:23,769 --> 02:39:24,849
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, it's good.

2124
02:39:24,909 --> 02:39:32,171
[SPEAKER_00]: But, oh, I'm going to give it a 3, for example, instead of a 7 or a 6, probably, that it should get.

2125
02:39:32,191 --> 02:39:32,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

2126
02:39:32,851 --> 02:39:54,296
[SPEAKER_05]: is it may be bad in a relative sense where you know this game is getting review scores that are lower than the other Pokemon games so either a people are feeling burnout or b it's not a bad game per se but it's a bad Pokemon game because all the other Pokemon games are so good and this one's you know not really the best in the series

2127
02:39:55,016 --> 02:40:03,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably a former, since most people have been talking about that, that the gameplay has gotten pretty repetitive.

2128
02:40:04,466 --> 02:40:08,370
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't changed, but then again, if it isn't broke, why fix it?

2129
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:10,381
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

2130
02:40:11,543 --> 02:40:13,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Actdeft, anything else you want to say tonight?

2131
02:40:14,867 --> 02:40:15,468
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing.

2132
02:40:15,788 --> 02:40:18,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Just expect a few, well, a little plug here.

2133
02:40:19,192 --> 02:40:27,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Just expect a few little new articles from I Love That Song, especially since Halloween is coming, so it'll be fun.

2134
02:40:28,724 --> 02:40:37,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I'm behind on posting articles, but I know you've got some great stuff in the queue, and when all this other mess in my life is over, I'll be able to focus on that again, so it'll be great.

2135
02:40:38,794 --> 02:40:39,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry about that.

2136
02:40:39,995 --> 02:40:42,657
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll get done eventually.

2137
02:40:42,878 --> 02:40:43,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it will.

2138
02:40:43,818 --> 02:40:44,799
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't let it fall off the radar.

2139
02:40:45,080 --> 02:40:45,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you take care, buddy.

2140
02:40:45,980 --> 02:40:46,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for calling.

2141
02:40:47,222 --> 02:40:47,842
[SPEAKER_05]: You too, thanks.

2142
02:40:50,481 --> 02:40:55,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, 1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if anybody else wants to call in.

2143
02:40:56,624 --> 02:40:57,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you out of stuff to talk about, Loki?

2144
02:40:57,985 --> 02:40:59,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember if you had anything else left.

2145
02:41:01,927 --> 02:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just looking at some of the stuff, just going through different websites and stuff.

2146
02:41:05,589 --> 02:41:12,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently in the manual for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, they have an advertisement for the Pokedex 3D Pro.

2147
02:41:13,373 --> 02:41:16,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming November 8th and for $15 on the eShop.

2148
02:41:18,268 --> 02:41:21,050
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why the old one's no longer available.

2149
02:41:21,190 --> 02:41:22,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It all makes sense now.

2150
02:41:24,412 --> 02:41:24,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

2151
02:41:26,414 --> 02:41:29,916
[SPEAKER_04]: See over 640 Pokemon in full 3D.

2152
02:41:29,976 --> 02:41:31,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's worth 15 bucks.

2153
02:41:31,457 --> 02:41:32,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, Nintendo.

2154
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:37,141
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another thing I saw.

2155
02:41:37,201 --> 02:41:40,323
[SPEAKER_04]: There was another hack on the Vita, actually.

2156
02:41:41,464 --> 02:41:44,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do follow Dash Hacks and they post that stuff.

2157
02:41:45,186 --> 02:41:45,447
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been...

2158
02:41:46,287 --> 02:41:54,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Not patched, but they removed the game that had the exploit for it, but it allowed people to run a custom firmware for the PSP on their Vita.

2159
02:41:54,190 --> 02:42:00,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can run a custom firmware for 6.6, and it'll actually allow you to run ISOs for the PSP and stuff.

2160
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:07,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, they've removed that game off of the PlayStation Store, so you can't get it.

2161
02:42:08,135 --> 02:42:11,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, that was the whole issue where there was some...

2162
02:42:12,136 --> 02:42:12,496
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2163
02:42:31,989 --> 02:42:36,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is 9 o'clock, and it looks like no more calls are coming in, so I guess we're going to close up the Skype line.

2164
02:42:37,493 --> 02:42:51,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to those that did call in tonight, and if you think of something a little later on, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, or of course there is always Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, or our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio.

2165
02:42:52,063 --> 02:42:52,723
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

2166
02:43:21,011 --> 02:43:23,232
[SPEAKER_05]: and who knows what will happen in gaming this week.

2167
02:43:23,252 --> 02:43:26,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We're starting to ramp up into that really busy holiday time of year.

2168
02:43:26,694 --> 02:43:31,437
[SPEAKER_05]: So out of all those games coming out, it'll be interesting to see which ones we play.

2169
02:43:31,757 --> 02:43:35,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And by this time next week, this play stuff I'm doing will be over with.

2170
02:43:35,879 --> 02:43:39,201
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll be able to kind of focus on this stuff again, which will be great.

2171
02:43:40,602 --> 02:43:42,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

2172
02:43:43,459 --> 02:43:50,384
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I don't know why I keep getting updates for Stitcher on... Freaking app.

2173
02:43:50,904 --> 02:43:51,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye app.

2174
02:43:51,965 --> 02:43:52,465
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

2175
02:43:52,885 --> 02:43:53,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2176
02:43:53,426 --> 02:43:59,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somehow Stitcher added itself to my Facebook, and I keep getting updates for Stitcher stuff.

2177
02:43:59,690 --> 02:44:02,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe because you voted in the award thing or something.

2178
02:44:02,612 --> 02:44:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

2179
02:44:03,333 --> 02:44:04,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, probably.

2180
02:44:04,193 --> 02:44:04,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you!

2181
02:44:06,735 --> 02:44:10,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Although we like Stitcher, you could always unlike it after voting if you need to.

2182
02:44:10,718 --> 02:44:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2183
02:44:13,382 --> 02:44:13,662
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2184
02:44:14,663 --> 02:44:24,411
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought tonight is seeing Loki's McDonald's bag makes me think that I just impromptu had McDonald's for breakfast yesterday and a sausage biscuit.

2185
02:44:25,152 --> 02:44:25,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

2186
02:44:26,233 --> 02:44:27,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally not healthy, but good times.

2187
02:44:28,215 --> 02:44:30,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a free, was it free McFlurry?

2188
02:44:31,357 --> 02:44:32,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, we playing Monopoly?

2189
02:44:32,618 --> 02:44:33,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

2190
02:44:33,379 --> 02:44:34,440
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so pathetic.

2191
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:42,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten McDonald's the last few days because I ran out of stuff to make lunches with, and it's literally almost the same game pieces every time.

2192
02:44:42,267 --> 02:44:45,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, they're not even trying anymore.

2193
02:44:46,131 --> 02:44:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten Boardwalk Park Plays like three times already.

2194
02:44:49,734 --> 02:44:50,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, fuck this.

2195
02:44:50,395 --> 02:44:52,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they want to get you really excited about maybe having a million.

2196
02:44:52,737 --> 02:44:55,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm totally going to win one million dollars.

2197
