10006	12208	Sky, and Loki.
13890	15291	Tonight, October 28th, 2012.
16512	18654	Has the PlayStation 3 been hacked again?
19034	20476	Zynga makes some big layoffs.
20896	23699	And could not all Wii U features make the system launch?
31539	36602	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36702	45286	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this October the 28th of 2012 episode number 479 of our show.
45626	51810	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all that good stuff with my co-host.
51850	54271	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56094	56594	How are you doing?
57475	58896	Yeah, you're like sick and stuff, huh?
58996	60177	I have a sinus infection.
60217	61237	You better not be contagious.
61477	63018	Sinus infections aren't contagious.
63138	65680	Last time you had a sinus infection, I got the swine flu.
66080	66921	You know what, Rob?
67101	67441	Okay.
67701	69122	I'm never going to let you live that down.
69142	69842	You know what that's from?
70042	71003	Not eating enough pork.
71203	72324	Oh, hi, Tech Master Loki.
72924	73344	How are you?
73805	74585	You mentioned pork.
74685	74945	Sorry.
75065	75326	All right.
75566	75766	Yes.
76166	76906	What were you going to say, DarkSakura?
76926	81529	I was going to say, I thought I had a sinus infection, and then I ended up getting like really sick.
81989	82770	I ended up like...
84364	89749	Not having a very bad version of it, and you ended up being like, what, bedridden or something?
90650	91631	So, sorry.
93052	100539	I can't help it if my immune system is wonderful, Rob, and that everything is just weak sauce when it hits me.
102821	104983	I am stronger than the swine flu.
105203	109587	If you want to join us and talk about sickness, or games would be preferred, but you never know.
110307	114389	Live.VogNetwork.com is where you can chat along with us.
114949	116770	And you can also check in if you are listening live.
116810	117751	Yes, those are on now.
118211	122793	Man, if it's not up by like the first second the intro music hits, I start getting private messages.
122873	123453	Check-ins are down.
123493	124014	Check-ins are down.
124054	124434	Check-ins are down.
124814	127255	But check-ins are now on for Orange Lounge Radio.
127695	128336	A little bit late.
128656	129236	Thanks, Bobby.
129696	132097	We are, of course, live after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
132318	137160	We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Blackwolf at The Voice of Geeks Network.
137680	149185	VOG Network.com Lots of great shows that play on VOG throughout the week, including my other show that's all about the World of Warcraft, The Best Lil' Horde House in Azeroth, or Horde House for short.
149205	156028	And the reason why I bring that up, crossover week this week with Girls Gone Wow, our friends over there in the UK.
156429	160010	And we were on their show today, and they're going to come on Horde House later this week.
160090	161511	So it's crossover week.
161911	162251	Why?
162331	164252	Because Sweeps Month is coming up!
164873	165613	Sweeps Month!
166448	168169	So that's where we gotta pull out all the stunts.
168569	173972	Crossover shows, super special episodes, and at the end of the month, somebody will die.
174693	175593	We just haven't figured out who yet.
176674	179215	Anyhow, um... Also, I feel kind of bad.
179475	179835	Huh, why?
180156	181536	For crocheting when I'm sick.
181877	187680	Because I feel like whoever is gonna get the scarf is gonna get diseases like I'm a European settler.
187980	193563	You should feel bad for crocheting when we have so many things in the gaming world to talk about this week.
193743	195884	I can talk and crochet at the same time, Rob.
196244	198345	Actually, it was kind of a slower news week.
198505	199845	We'll get into that later.
199885	201386	But let me put it this way.
201866	205048	Tonight we have Listless making a comeback tonight.
205388	207549	It has been forever since we played an OLR game.
207569	208809	I was just realizing that earlier.
208849	210150	So we are bringing back Listless tonight.
210190	211390	All of my answers are pie.
212931	213991	Well, you don't even know the topic.
214011	214591	Yeah, we'll get into the topic.
214631	215031	I don't care.
215092	217492	All of my answers are pie because of Alan.
217773	220814	Yeah, I was going to say you got to try Alan's award-winning...
222074	225436	I had to escort him to the parking lot to make sure he wouldn't get jumped.
225496	227318	Were you afraid of severe judgment?
227338	227398	Yes.
245484	246285	But everything was okay.
246785	247286	So there you go.
248066	252090	Again, live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us.
252670	257675	And DarkTetsuya pointing out, there goes Loki talking out of turn again, as he tends to do at the top of the show.
257695	258596	Technically not out of turn.
258676	259176	She talked.
259477	259917	I talked.
259937	261699	I just talked sooner than you were expecting me.
262739	263620	It's not out of turn, though.
264001	265782	Right now, don't give a shit.
266703	267744	Surprise, Loki.
267884	268364	Surprise!
269245	275727	Alright, I don't have a lot of stuff to talk about before we get into our gaming weeks and the news tonight.
275747	277827	Did we actually give Loki a full introduction?
277987	280748	Yeah, you mentioned it.
280788	281788	Who is this guy?
282148	284249	Who is this person that's talking?
284389	285969	I'm going to flip the table in a second.
286049	288290	I have missed the 478 prior episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.
289730	290670	Who is this guy?
290810	291151	Seriously.
291171	292411	I'm taking back my tootsie rolls.
292431	297293	I can't figure it out based on the intro and the two people that have been introduced.
297793	299934	I just wish I could deduce who this was.
300014	301735	Let me go back for a minute here.
302355	303715	Let me listen to Midi Head again here.
303815	306596	You know what?
306796	307437	Stop it.
307557	308537	I'm on drugs.
308597	309938	The show is called Orange Lounge Radio.
309998	310718	I'm on drugs.
319138	319779	There he is!
321243	321704	You hush.
321744	322887	You know what I was talking about.
323007	325873	I will poke you in the eye with this needle.
330103	333525	All right, for real though, I have a serious kickoff topic tonight, for real.
335367	344793	Like, okay, probably the most number, like the highest concentration of listeners for Orange Lounge Radio is here in Northern California, because that's where we are, that's where a lot of the video games industry is.
345093	349236	So the highest concentration of listeners of Orange Lounge Radio is in Northern California.
349636	354460	The second highest concentration of OLR listeners, I'm pretty sure, is New York City.
355040	359504	So obviously New York's going through a little bit right now with this whole... I don't know.
359544	361785	Some woman named Sandy is coming to blow everybody.
361886	363847	Because she's... You're the one that she wants.
363927	364628	Sound like a porno.
365048	365869	Ooh, hoo, hoo.
366249	371553	In all seriousness, if you are in the path of that hurricane, I hope you've taken all those precautions to be safe.
371693	374756	If they've told you to evacuate, please turn off OLR.
374896	376457	We will be there on the podcast feed later.
376857	378659	And evacuate if that's what they've told you to do.
379179	381801	But if you have holed yourself up in the house with the...
383643	390247	DJ Ranma's picture earlier was any indication?
390267	393969	Did you see the picture that Ranma posted earlier of all his booze?
394250	394850	He had all this booze.
394870	396131	He's like, I'm ready for the hurricane.
397443	398323	You know what, Rob?
398363	401004	Think about New York City and think about trying to evacuate.
401284	401864	Not happening.
402104	402585	I know, right?
402645	403825	Well, they closed the subway.
403865	404765	They closed the schools.
405125	408886	By the time a hurricane hits up there, you know what it's going to be?
409427	410007	A sneeze.
410307	411227	I hope you're right.
411347	413268	Well, because you know last night... They lose...
414028	418131	Momentum Inland I'm more worried about Florida Is that big of a hurricane?
418171	420173	Well, even a small hurricane is fairly big, Rob
440919	443981	Well, no matter what, look, we live in California.
444021	445841	This isn't something we really have to deal with here.
445901	447262	We have the earthquake thing instead.
447762	450564	But if you're in the path of this thing, I hope you're safe.
450684	451804	That's what I really wanted to say.
452164	457507	Fill your bathtub full of water, buy bleach, get all the bread in the grocery store, and cans.
457727	459028	Ignorant California question.
460308	461629	Why do you fill your bathtub with water?
461849	469633	In case the water pipes break or you get sewage backed up into the water, you have a tub, which is like what I think
471570	473951	I want to say seven gallons of fresh water.
474452	476993	And you put like two drops of bleach in it to purify it.
477554	478054	Oh, okay.
478614	482076	So that way, even if the water lines are down, you have drinking water.
482437	483257	Okay, that makes sense.
483817	485178	So you just need to have plenty of drinking water.
485338	486899	Yeah, and you know why you tape the windows, right?
487780	489421	That has to do with the pressure, right?
489481	494044	Apart from that too, if they actually break, the tape will hold it and keep it from shattering.
494544	495524	Okay, yeah, that's what I figured.
495685	496685	I knew it was something along those lines.
496705	499307	Also stops the fog from coming in that turns people inside out.
503003	503504	Shut up.
503604	504907	That's a Simpsons reference.
505688	505989	All right.
506109	507272	Anyhow, look.
509124	525997	I wanted to bring up this story because I had no idea that somebody was already waiting in line at Nintendo World for a Wii U. Isaiah Triforce Johnson, I guess he changed his name to have Triforce in it, he is a diehard Nintendo fan to say the least.
526197	532722	I believe this is him last time with Reggie getting his Wii, so this guy is no stranger to camping out overnight.
532742	534263	Why does Reggie always look like a mannequin?
535043	535784	Because he's pretty.
536420	537241	Look at his eyes.
537721	540603	Because his body was ready for cybernetic enhancement.
540623	541804	He looks like he's a wax man.
541884	543065	He's perfectly groomed.
543105	544406	He's a well-groomed man.
544486	545547	There's nothing wrong with that.
545607	547489	He's got to be a public figure for Nintendo.
547789	548810	He can't look crazy.
548970	552332	Like if Doc Brown came up and like, Hi, OU!
552533	553894	His skin looks waxy.
554914	555975	Does he wax his face?
556055	556776	That might sell me OU.
559622	561083	Well, anyway, look, the real story.
561723	571587	Mr. Triforce Johnson had to give up his spot in line because they basically said the security at Rockefeller Center said you need to vacate by 6 p.m.
571827	573688	So he had to actually leave.
574168	582832	However, it has been promised that he may return to his place after Nintendo World reopens when the hurricane has passed.
582952	583152	So...
583832	586874	The hurricane has already caused at least one major disruption.
586894	590156	Oh, well, then we should just call this Hurricane Common Sense.
590797	595079	Because who the fuck lines up for a Wii U a month before it comes out?
595119	597861	If this thing is disastrous, you are going to feel bad about making jokes about it.
597881	598902	No, I'm not going to feel bad.
599502	600463	I feel no remorse.
602833	605837	No pity, and he will not stop until you are dead.
606237	607399	Wait, that was Terminator, sorry.
607419	615289	I can understand lining up a couple days ahead of time or the night of, but a month ahead of time?
615529	616470	He wanted to be the first.
616510	620255	Might as well just stay in line for the next Nintendo system.
621840	623702	Taiki asks Who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B?
638840	641201	Well, Cliffy does have the youth going for him.
641261	641621	He does.
641661	642501	He is a lot younger.
643301	646803	Reggie's kind of trollish, so it's hard to say.
647183	651984	But Reggie is probably much nicer in person, whereas Cliffy kind of comes off as a douche.
652624	656826	The thing about Cliffy, and I know this is exactly what you wanted to hear on a video game podcast this week.
657186	662768	The thing about Cliffy is he kind of has that male porn star hair going for him that's not doing him any favors.
662788	663208	Because like...
664108	690486	straight men in porn not always that exciting to look at you know like and he's kind of got that hair going for it and it's kind of I don't know it's it's like some minus points but you're right he does have that youth factor he doesn't look waxy like Reggie male porn stars always make me think of diseases walking herpes uh what up G in chat says Nintendo should just send him a Wii U do you think Mr. Triforce Johnson has earned the damn Wii U at this point
692619	693860	for staying in line for a month.
693880	694820	Nintendo wants money.
697341	697661	Let's see.
697741	704563	TigerClaw on chat says, Nintendo did say he will still be the first in line, which is good PR for Nintendo.
705063	705583	There you go.
706643	709044	I would have laughed if someone snuck in front of him before.
711425	711605	What?
711645	712845	I was waiting here before you.
713425	714026	You left.
715626	717047	Ranma, run out there quick.
723707	724628	Alright, there you go.
726468	732671	Even though we're having fun with the subject and the story and everything, first off, props to that guy for being so damn dedicated.
732811	733071	You know what?
733111	733791	Props to you, sir.
734311	738773	And second off, for real, we hope everybody is safe in this hurricane.
738993	739634	Please be safe.
741295	756295	don't be stupid no props to him for standing out there a month in advance he's actually he's on the payroll for Nintendo a little bit as well he's done some of like events and stuff for Nintendo and actually covered stuff as you know
757236	758617	A liaison for Nintendo.
759078	759979	I'm sorry, no.
760179	762361	No props for this dude staying a month in advance.
762821	765063	Yeah, cool, you're a dedicated Nintendo fan.
765243	768546	Yeah, you couldn't be up Reggie's ass a little bit more than you are.
769067	771389	So, I mean, cool that you're really excited.
772976	779742	If Reggie's ass is as waxy as the rest of him, then it should be as smooth... I just... This is starting to go to a place I'm not okay with.
779822	781663	I'm just not... Just throwing it out there.
781703	789009	I'm just... It's just like those people that stand... You know, I understand it's like, oh, hey, it's fandom and stuff like that, but...
789950	791993	There's gotta be a line to draw here, okay?
792013	798684	It'd be like me, well, I'm gonna stand out in front of this building for a year because I'm waiting for the next Xbox 360 or something.
798804	800046	People are gonna be like, no, you're an idiot.
800106	803270	You should go stand in line for Breaking Dawn Part 2.
803311	803391	No.
805262	805942	No, I'm not.
806483	807743	You know someone is somewhere.
807943	808703	No, no one is.
809364	810064	Because you know why?
810084	811504	Because they don't have to do it anymore.
811625	815026	They have Fandango and places you can buy tickets online.
815566	820948	So that, you know, all those people are like, oh, hey, I waited here for, you know, a couple days to get my tickets to Batman.
820968	821808	You're like, fuck you.
821829	825430	I just spent two seconds and went online and got tickets for Batman.
826150	827451	Oh, who's the idiot now?
827571	832113	You know, there are some movies where they do the midnight openings where they don't put them up on Fandango.
833573	837858	Alright, let's... I, however, saw Frankenweenie opening night at Disneyland.
838218	838539	The end.
838999	840481	And trust me... Well, can I touch you?
841622	841922	No.
842503	843504	I might catch gay.
843624	847949	Speaking of movies, speaking of movies, and I know we already have movies as a kickoff topic a couple weeks ago.
847969	848690	Can we just see the gift?
849230	853433	but I quickly want to say Silent Hill 3D Revelation.
853573	854574	I did not see it yet.
854674	855394	None of us did.
856115	857716	But I hear it is so bad.
858356	860418	Like it's showgirls bad without the tits.
860698	862559	Like it is really bad.
862679	864180	And that makes me want to see it more.
864481	865702	Rob, let's do this.
865982	866162	What?
866282	866662	Next week.
867563	868624	We need to see it at some point.
869504	869904	Tomorrow night.
870485	872326	We'll have your people call my people and find a time.
872346	872706	Tomorrow night.
873347	874468	That actually probably will work.
874828	875008	Okay.
875348	875809	But I don't know.
875829	877850	I got to make sure the other half won't be mad that I see it without them.
878203	883485	Well, I'll be going, sniff, snort, because I'll be sick.
884225	889828	And then, of course, this coming week, Wreck-It Ralph, which I know we've all been excited about.
889928	894730	One other thing I heard about that movie is that the flashlights, the shine from the flashlights are in 3D.
896053	896453	Oh boy.
896654	897755	I know, right?
898695	907743	Our buddy Mel, you know, Mel B, the classic DDR freestyler, he, I don't know, he got some type of hookup or passes, won him, I don't know.
908023	911306	He got to already see Wreck-It Ralph, and he gave it his stamp of approval.
911786	915009	That's pretty important, so we know that movie isn't going to completely suck.
915550	916370	So I'm excited about that.
916691	923516	Acidic Vampire, pointing out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Silent Hill has a less than 10% rating on rottentomatoes.com.
924958	927120	That's when you know it's like really bad.
927180	929683	It's not like 30% bad, it's less than 10% bad.
929763	931665	I actually liked the first one.
932186	932726	I did too.
933347	934748	I saw it four times in a theater.
934909	936010	I own two copies of it.
936090	936430	Shit.
937632	938773	So I have to see this.
940296	945182	Ragenator in chat says Showgirls should be remade in 3D Nothing beats 3D boobs, right?
945783	954154	That may be true, but honestly when it comes to Showgirls, nothing beats going to the Castro Theater and watching a bunch of drag queens reenact the scene where she comes out of the volcano
954654	956155	I'm so mad I missed it this year.
957615	959316	That's like your reason to live right there.
959976	967299	And if you want a close second to a possible Showgirls in 3D, you can just watch, like, was it Piranha 3DD?
967539	970180	That's true.
970961	971401	That's true.
972381	975162	I'm actually super upset that I missed Showgirls this year.
975863	976683	There's always next year.
977665	979026	Next year we need a huge group.
979827	981629	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
981689	984873	Back to video games and what we have been playing this week.
984993	986014	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
987099	988620	Mass Effect, the first one.
988660	990360	Because my Mass Effect 3 still doesn't work.
991341	994522	I mean, I can kind of get it to run and I've gotten into multiplayer now.
995383	999144	But it's like, it's just awful.
999325	1000785	And they've escalated me again.
1000805	1001946	This will come up in the FUs.
1002866	1004607	And I've hardly played any WoW, actually.
1005127	1008228	You had like hella customer service EA stuff this week, didn't you?
1008248	1013171	I was on with two different customer service reps in their live chat for seven hours.
1014315	1014955	Thank you for watching!
1033520	1035843	And I was like, dude, no offense to you.
1036164	1037666	I want to speak to somebody in U.S.
1037706	1044795	customer service who actually will listen to what I'm saying and not just make assumptions about what I'm saying.
1045236	1049401	Because if you go back and read the log, you'll understand this has nothing to do with my DLC.
1049421	1050463	It has to do with Dan Patch.
1050882	1062848	The thing about outsourced customer service in general, and it doesn't matter what country it's from, even within the US outsourcing sometimes, is that they usually are stuck to a script.
1063249	1071313	And if your inquiry or your question deviates from that script and the things that they are very literally trained to handle, that's when you start to run into issues.
1071733	1078557	And unfortunately, what upper management fails to see a lot of the time is that most inquiries go off script.
1079272	1081473	I worked in customer service for how long?
1082934	1085935	The reason why I was good is because I stopped following my script.
1086415	1088196	Because I knew what I was talking about.
1089757	1092138	And it's just gone on way too long.
1092178	1096600	And I finally, they said, oh, we'll do the email service.
1096660	1101943	And they had me do a trace, which that I thought was a good idea to see if there was a connection problem on my end.
1102303	1105285	But I can tell you right when the problem started, it started with the last patch.
1106245	1107406	The patch did something.
1108206	1111088	Because before that, I had no problem.
1112189	1114891	So, just, ugh, I'm so tired of it.
1116832	1122876	And also, just with, uh, I started getting, I started with the sinus infection yesterday.
1123356	1124717	It was while I was out running errands.
1124777	1128540	It's just, I haven't really felt like playing much in the way of games.
1128580	1130982	And then when I got home, I was like, I'll want to play as Mass Effect.
1131662	1132343	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1160960	1161600	It does not work.
1161920	1163001	It feels very wrong.
1165242	1166802	You know, these are all fake people, right?
1166982	1167422	I know.
1167642	1168483	Liara is blue.
1168883	1169183	I know.
1169723	1170323	But, okay.
1171104	1178786	It's the point, though, of believability in what one... Because, I mean, yeah, some people are really into dating children, I guess.
1179666	1182847	You know, I... Maybe it's just I'm spoiled by Garrus.
1182928	1183288	I don't know.
1183548	1187129	Acidic Vampire in our chatroom asks, have other people had the same problem with the patch?
1187819	1188019	Yes!
1188760	1189600	I'm not the only one.
1190621	1191881	So, it's been going on.
1192021	1198685	And actually, people are now referencing my thing on the EA answer thing on BioWare's forums.
1199345	1200466	Several people have reposted it.
1200546	1205869	A bunch of us have actually gone on to the Mass Effect Facebook page and linked it, which they've deleted.
1206589	1207070	Interesting.
1208370	1209991	Alright, Loki, let's move on to you.
1210051	1210711	How was your gaming week?
1211152	1212813	I played Minecraft.
1213613	1214313	It's pretty much it.
1214353	1219976	I mean, I was working on some stuff for that, just on the roller coaster that I had there.
1220217	1229021	We added some more pixel art stuff in there, have a portion where it jumps into the mouth of a piranha plant, which is pretty sweet.
1229602	1239527	And then, was it, Hidstun was making, he made a knight's, I don't remember what the main character knight is, I guess knight's.
1240630	1241373	It would be knights.
1241513	1244163	Yes, made knights flying in the air, so that's kind of cool.
1247580	1260483	We got the new patch this week, so I've updated the server and been playing around command blocks, made some teleportation stations so we can hop to different parts of the map pretty quick.
1261703	1264183	And that's about it.
1264203	1269344	I just wish more people were on there, because it's usually just me, and then occasionally I'll see people pop in.
1270205	1271365	But it's been pretty slow.
1271485	1274425	I know there's a lot of games out right now, so it's not surprising.
1274845	1276446	I was actually going to play some of those games, but...
1277686	1279507	I didn't know which one I wanted to play.
1279667	1289310	I got into that weird gamer ADD stuff where I was like, I can play Dishonored and start that game, but I don't want to start another game because I'm already in the middle of Borderlands 2.
1289750	1291651	I don't know.
1292291	1292991	It's tough.
1293031	1294732	Dan's already beaten that game three times.
1295132	1295772	I'm sure he has.
1297553	1300654	Oh, and then I guess I played Call of Duty a little bit, Modern Warfare 3.
1301854	1303115	Can't wait to play Black Ops 2.
1303475	1305235	It'll be nice to switch up to something different.
1306276	1306676	But, um...
1307637	1308798	That's pretty much it right now.
1309879	1320251	My gaming week, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, but I did decide I finally had it with Mass Effect 3 and Origin in general, so I am done with the PC version of Mass Effect 3.
1320391	1321753	I want nothing to do with it anymore.
1322673	1334097	So I went back to the Xbox 360 version, which, although it kind of stinks that it's harder to do with the controllers than the keyboard and mouse, I got used to it pretty quick.
1334237	1338678	And it is really sad that I really don't have connection problems on the 360 whatsoever.
1338778	1344520	I have none of those loading problems or delays or any of that shit that you get with Origin, and it's so refreshing.
1345680	1373209	and I had some characters unlocked on the 360 prior that I just really missed like my Quarian Engineer so Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect lots of that other games though besides Mass Effect believe it or not LittleBigPlanet Vita I played some more of that I mentioned I touched this game a little bit last week but I didn't really play a lot of it I got to play some more of it this week and I'm overall pretty satisfied with it a lot of what I said last week still holds true it's a lot of the good stuff from LittleBigPlanet too and
1373789	1380282	However, I finally figured out why the game wasn't bugging me about the online connectivity when I was playing it last week.
1380963	1384390	Because the game has an online pass and I hadn't put in the code yet.
1386827	1393471	And, um, so when I finally, cause you know, you have to beat the entire first world before you unlock the moon and the community levels and all that.
1393892	1396814	So once I unlocked that, it's like, oh, hey, you need an online pass.
1396914	1398735	It's like, you need to enter in the code from the manual.
1398755	1404598	And I'm like, there's no manual with little, and I started like, oh my God, did I get, get ripped off?
1404919	1409402	But I opened up the box and there was a code there for, it said, um,
1410282	1412344	The costumes from the Bioshock characters.
1412484	1417109	It said, congratulations on your pre-order bonus for Big Daddy costume and all this stuff.
1417149	1420312	And I'm like, wait a minute, that's not an online code.
1420332	1422294	And I'm like, I'm going to put it in anyway.
1422634	1424316	Sure enough, it was the online passcode.
1424336	1426458	I put it in and it said, you've unlocked the online pass.
1426478	1427759	And I'm like, great.
1427779	1429681	So if I didn't think to try that, I would have thought...
1430822	1431422	Thanks for watching!
1445640	1447202	That was LittleBigPlanetVita.
1448162	1451305	I do like some of the enhancements they made to the online community stuff.
1451646	1456410	You can download levels now, so you don't have to go connect and find them every time.
1457010	1462495	Some of the levels online are really stupid, though, but that's to be expected with any creation game.
1462535	1466179	You're only going to find a few gems in the haystack.
1466699	1495668	but uh yeah it's as far as you know execution it is what you would expect on a little Vita screen and for that it's it's pretty awesome I gotta say something else I played on the Vita it's only a demo and I don't like to review games based off the demo but after Shane's strong words last week about how he felt about Silent Hill Book of Memories you know I had to go download the demo and so I played the entire demo which was a good I don't know it was like the whole first level up through the boss I didn't hate it
1496828	1523725	but it's really not Silent Hill like it is a dungeon explorer crawler game with Silent Hill graphics stamped on it and so like if I were obsessed with the lore and really into the storytelling as Shane was talking about on the call at the end of last week's show I could see where that's offensive like having Valtiel be the quest giver at the beginning of the floor some of that stuff's really hokey but I didn't hate it
1524645	1542972	I wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it but I would totally rent the game for a weekend just to beat it because I was kind of interested in where the story was going because it was very like you are the main character and you're doing all these things and I liked kind of the haunting memories that were playing on the TVs and all this stuff so
1544631	1552094	I was kind of into the story, so I didn't hate it as much as Shane did, but I get why people aren't into it, because it's not really Silent Hill.
1552234	1553734	I wouldn't play it after that description.
1554014	1554254	Yeah.
1555015	1558136	I could bring it out here and show it to you, but you'd probably be like, eh.
1559396	1561577	I don't want to blow infected snot all over it.
1562277	1564258	All I had to do was look at the back cover, and I was like, nope.
1565659	1568641	I don't think it's that bad, but it's not Silent Hill.
1568881	1570623	That's really the best way I can describe it.
1571644	1576267	One other thing I'll quickly say, Smart Glass came out for Android devices.
1576328	1580971	So I'm sure many of you have checked out Microsoft Smart Glass because it's on all the Android devices.
1581372	1585275	And here's where me having an iPhone and Alan having an Android device comes in handy.
1585755	1589198	So we got out his Galaxy 3 and downloaded Smart Glass to it.
1589458	1591220	And I was playing around with the Xbox on it.
1594162	1595303	What's the big deal?
1596163	1596504	Nothing.
1596624	1599607	It really doesn't do anything right now that the app didn't do before.
1600087	1603410	I seem to remember the existing app would allow you to control your Xbox.
1603450	1607014	How did you use it with, what was it, Dance Central?
1615240	1615960	Thanks for watching!
1637725	1638826	So, yeah.
1639467	1641708	But, you know, it was just, okay, big deal.
1641769	1649415	I can swipe on the menu and use, but I'm almost positive the existing Xbox app that was out there would allow you to remote control your Xbox in the same way.
1649795	1651016	Like, I don't think that's new.
1651697	1652237	I really don't.
1652257	1652678	Yes, you can.
1652998	1657722	So, and then we're waiting for the TV and movie stuff, but none of that's in there yet.
1657782	1660905	So it's like, okay, they've got the framework for smart glass down.
1660985	1662186	Now let's see you use it.
1663615	1664456	Coming in 2013.
1664776	1665196	Usefulness.
1666197	1670520	Well, it's just like, was it the Xbox Vision Camera?
1671041	1672562	We've got the framework in place.
1672622	1675424	Now let's see the one, two games that are going to use this.
1675744	1677946	You can make a user icon out of your face.
1678066	1680168	That's about the most that Vision Camera is good for.
1680188	1681749	That's all I really use that for.
1681809	1683170	You can't do that with Kinect either, huh?
1683190	1683530	Yes, you can.
1683550	1683931	Oh, can you?
1684131	1684271	Yeah.
1684991	1686753	Well then, so much for the Vision Cam.
1687173	1689214	Yeah, it's... Absolutely.
1689874	1690174	Alright.
1691694	1696856	That's it for Gaming Week for me and for our other hosts.
1696916	1699517	Let's talk about housekeeping and then we'll get into the news this week.
1700157	1700697	Housekeeping.
1701237	1702037	Follow us on Twitter.
1702097	1703538	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1704658	1705498	Follow us on Facebook.
1705538	1707179	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1708257	1709258	We have an interview next week.
1709298	1710559	We haven't had an interview in a while.
1711559	1713080	This one is for the old school listeners.
1713861	1724668	As you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a show about music-based video games and for a long time we were pretty much exclusively about like the DDR and Beatmania and music game community.
1725148	1729791	So it's pretty surprising to me that in our ten and a half year history we've never had this guy on.
1730712	1737797	We may have had him on like for five minutes on one of the E3 specials but we are going to properly have on the show next week
1738757	1755890	Eddie from BomaniStyle.com is going to be on the show talking about what you know especially because we have a news story tonight about like DDR's reboot and all this stuff and I'm not going to spoil too much about that but we really want to get his thoughts on kind of where the music game community is going because I'll tell you this
1756650	1783813	Eddie obviously has a lot of love for the Bomani community and a lot of the stuff that he did was a lot of the stuff that many of us dreamed about he had the Uber website he started this record label thing or this record distribution thing where he was shipping out a lot of the music he got some of these artists to come to ASEN he's really been intimately involved with a lot of music gaming like today so getting to pick his brain on a lot of like music gaming and his thoughts is going to be a lot of fun
1784293	1786994	So this is going to be a fun episode next week.
1787094	1789515	Eddie from BomaniStyle.com will be here.
1790155	1791615	Sounds super.
1791835	1792136	I know.
1792236	1792796	And it's live.
1792996	1794556	So you guys will be able to ask him questions.
1794616	1798438	So make sure you're here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1798478	1801519	That is next week, November 4th, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
1802299	1802619	All right.
1804079	1805660	I think that's all I have for housekeeping.
1805680	1805860	Yeah.
1806420	1808042	All right, let's get into the news tonight.
1808583	1809664	Loki, start us off.
1810144	1818694	So, G4 has finally canceled the last two bits of the old G4, which would be X-Play and Attack of the Show.
1819375	1820656	And even Attack of the Show is not...
1821357	1822558	DarkSakura, Loki,
1841208	1847210	and apparently the rumor is that the channel is supposed to shift towards like a guy network.
1847650	1853632	They're saying it's like Esquire or GQ channel, which sounds very boring, but cool.
1854293	1860094	I wonder where Cheaters reruns and Cops reruns fit into that, but we'll see.
1862675	1867417	Well, to the news that these shows are leaving, this is all I have to say on the matter.
1867437	1867477	Ow!
1875436	1876697	and that's all, folks.
1880420	1881301	I like the scream.
1881361	1882562	The scream really does it for me.
1884043	1886846	That was a really good particular Bugs Bunny ending, wasn't it?
1886946	1890229	It's sad, but it's not like we all didn't see this coming.
1891029	1892510	Yeah.
1893391	1894532	I don't... You know what?
1894612	1896614	It was the merger that was the beginning of the end.
1896634	1900497	I was going to say, without sounding like a heartless bitch, it's really not sad either.
1900617	1903560	I'm sorry, but I mean, the biggest...
1903840	1904361	and DarkSakura.com
1924921	1928405	I miss Tech TV so much.
1928605	1931889	It's just like, that was the most awesome network ever.
1932389	1935913	And then it's like, hey, G4 sounds pretty cool.
1936373	1939236	And then they mixed them together and it's like, whoa, this is like the best thing ever.
1939537	1941559	And it went so downhill from there.
1941639	1943701	It's just like, I don't even understand how that's possible, but...
1944862	1953514	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Acidic Vampire in our chat says, Oh, I thought you were going to play a RuPaul's Sashay Away clip.
1953534	1954416	I wish I'd thought of that.
1954776	1955657	Next time, next time.
1956418	1961686	The Sag in our chatroom says, Man, I wonder what the people who have G4 tattooed on them think.
1965447	1966408	I forgot about that.
1966468	1968109	They were doing that on E3, weren't they?
1968890	1969330	I don't know.
1969370	1970911	I'm pretty sure they were at one point.
1971611	1974153	They're like, they better pay for the removal.
1975714	1987843	Well, look, and here's the thing, especially judging off the Twitter reaction and all the stuff this week, like people were like, I'm so sad that these shows are leaving and man, G4, there's no video game thing on anymore and all this stuff.
1987883	1990985	And I'm like, you guys are... They still have their same presence at E3.
1991005	1991085	Yeah.
1993947	2000333	You guys are remembering these shows from three years ago back when you were actually watching them.
2000874	2005738	If you all were actually watching them, this news would not be coming because it's all about ratings.
2005758	2008000	If they hadn't changed them, people would have been watching them.
2008040	2011363	Oh my god, the new guy on Xplay was fucking annoying.
2011844	2014106	I don't... See, I don't even... I watched the clip.
2014146	2015327	They had a clip of something.
2015347	2016548	I don't remember what it was about, but...
2017869	2019071	It was fucking annoying.
2019091	2021152	The guy was a total asshat.
2023294	2025677	Ragenator in chat says, Personally, I love the shows.
2025797	2028079	Those shows were the reason I subscribed to cable in 2008.
2028539	2032543	A lot of people kind of reminiscing on the older G4 stuff.
2032603	2038048	And yeah, you know, it's unfortunate, but the network was already over several years ago.
2038128	2041171	Remember when they started showing reruns of Cops?
2041651	2042032	Hello.
2042552	2043133	I mean, come on.
2044389	2046671	The first downfall was the merger.
2049373	2054736	And I want to really know where the financial status was that made the merger necessary.
2055137	2065644	Well, according to Blackwolf in our chat room, and he was pretty intimately involved in the early days of G4, and he talks about that on his own show, but Bobby's in chat and says, Paul Allen got tired of tech TV.
2066284	2074041	that's why he sold it to Comcast even though they were about to have positive ratings for the first time so somebody just threw their hands up and said I'm kind of over it
2075313	2075773	I'm curious.
2075793	2077735	A lot of people talking about the E3 coverage.
2077795	2084839	You know, for some people, that's all G4 is now is E3 coverage because they have done the live stuff from the show floor and so on.
2084899	2088722	So does that mean the tiara goes to Spike TV by default?
2088742	2089883	They've already been doing that.
2089963	2094606	Spike TV was live streaming all the coverage through game trailers, their partnership with game trailers.
2094686	2096447	Weren't they like across the street?
2097068	2097408	Oh, okay.
2097448	2101230	They were actually in the... Yeah, they were doing all of the press conferences.
2101811	2103852	So Spike had a thing going already.
2105353	2105933	Thanks for watching!
2124821	2126443	I think Spike's alright.
2127463	2128464	It's kind of funny.
2128484	2134510	If they're going to be shifting to this guy channel thing, that's kind of what Spike's already doing right now.
2135511	2136451	Sort of.
2136571	2139274	They're not really doing the GQ stuff.
2139294	2145920	They're kind of taking more of the lowbrow route to that.
2145960	2150103	Shows with big-titted women and stuff like that.
2150123	2151905	A Thousand Ways to Die or
2153550	2154211	GameTrailersTV GameTrailersTV
2178391	2186697	It kind of surprised me because, you know, I thought video games were supposed to be like the modern version of movies or music, you know, some new art form.
2186957	2190900	And we have tons of shows about movies and TV shows and music.
2191500	2194062	Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood.
2194442	2196504	Who watches Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood?
2196664	2196904	Old people.
2196924	2198125	People that are old.
2198325	2198806	Grandma.
2198946	2203729	That don't know how to use the internet or just don't care to watch the internet.
2203789	2205531	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2219268	2239102	and then they can get kind of like a quick feed of you know what's coming out and you know what the news is and stuff but unfortunately the gaming demographic a lot of those people are just like internet crazy and so the news travels a lot faster on the internet than obviously these shows can pick up on but
2240123	2241484	It doesn't mean that they can fail.
2241504	2252149	I mean, a lot of these shows, if they have... And this is kind of the whole thing with GameTrailersTV is they make a lot of news because they get a lot of exclusive interviews and exclusive trailers and stuff like that.
2252169	2255751	You're going to see it first on that show before you see it on the internet.
2256031	2262535	That's where the key is to running a successful kind of entertainment business, at least as far as gaming stuff...
2263115	2265616	I mean, look at Game Informer, same thing there.
2266296	2279760	That's how they were able to kind of, other than, you know, coming free with, you know, subscribing to GameStop's card, but a lot of their stuff is, you know, they leverage these interviews and exclusives and stuff, and so they're kind of the source of news.
2280512	2282713	BlackWolf wants to point out that Electric Playground and Judgment Day are still around.
2282733	2284414	You might know Judgment Day as reviews on the run.
2299142	2301623	Electric Playground is in syndication.
2301783	2304164	A lot of ABC affiliates on the weekends right now.
2304244	2310787	So I guess for me to say that Game Trailers TV is the only video game show left on all of television is a falsity.
2310847	2311727	So sorry for that.
2312027	2315188	I guess you could say on all like cable because syndication doesn't really hit cable.
2315308	2318029	What would syndicate Electric Playground have anything to offer?
2318109	2321331	Like I don't really give a shit about a review of Halo 2 or something like that.
2321351	2321571	Well...
2322551	2328735	I would say it's the equivalent of Ebert and Roper, although I don't even think that exists anymore, but At The Movies or whatever they call that.
2329115	2330536	You know, what's the point of that show?
2330716	2334418	It's reviews on movies, so why not have a show that's review on games?
2334499	2334919	I get it.
2335299	2339922	I don't think it's any different than the Roper or Ebert stuff from five years ago, so...
2341163	2343125	That's the niche it's filling, I assume.
2344267	2346689	TigerClaw on chat says, Old people watch those shows.
2347090	2352176	Young people, they watch things like TMZ.com for all the entertainment news and gossip.
2353357	2354959	TMZ's kind of trash, though.
2355319	2355920	You know what I do?
2356681	2357622	I look at your Facebook.
2359195	2360055	Here's what I want to know.
2360095	2363517	What's happening to... Oh, oh, oh.
2363577	2366358	Black Wolf thinks... Oh, I didn't get this.
2366698	2370239	Black Wolf thinks that you missed the point that these are new episodes.
2370299	2373680	These are not syndicated old stuff from G4.
2373760	2379002	These are new episodes, but it's like Baywatch was a syndicated show when it was new and all that.
2379042	2380063	So these are new things.
2380743	2381163	Sorry about that.
2381203	2381823	I didn't catch that.
2381844	2382664	I thought you meant to say Halo 4.
2382704	2384164	Well, if it's new stuff, then that's all right.
2384244	2385505	Yeah, it's new stuff.
2386085	2386545	I don't know.
2386565	2388026	I remember watching Electric Playground.
2388826	2390607	Is Tommy Tallarico still doing that stuff?
2390747	2391468	I believe so.
2391488	2394009	I think it's still him and that other guy, Victor's guy.
2394449	2395710	Yeah, they're kind of annoying.
2395770	2397411	But I do respect Tommy Tallarico.
2397691	2399692	But yeah, one of them was really annoying.
2399712	2400592	I just can't remember who.
2401773	2402973	I don't think it was Tommy Tallarico.
2402993	2404814	Well, you know, but then it's the same thing.
2404874	2407335	Some people think Ebert was annoying or Roper.
2407355	2407856	I don't know.
2407916	2408956	It's just the one that you agree with.
2408976	2410157	I'm sure a lot of people think I'm annoying.
2411097	2411777	Uh, yeah, that's right.
2414498	2417639	Um, let's see, what, uh, what else is gonna bring up with this?
2417719	2418959	Oh, the TMZ.com bit.
2420239	2422600	TMZ is kind of a trash, trash thing, though.
2422700	2423500	I mean, let's be real.
2423800	2432122	All TMZ runs is trash, and it's the type of stuff that, you know, gets posted on Facebook, like, oh my god, Lindsay Lohan with the intervention, da-da-da-da-da.
2432783	2433463	I'm surprised.
2433923	2434923	But, real quick.
2435163	2435343	What?
2435723	2437684	What the fuck is up with her playing Liz Taylor?
2437984	2438324	Ha ha ha!
2440518	2445259	I was just about to ask, so where is our trashy gossip site about video games?
2445359	2447339	Who is the Perez Hilton of video games?
2447739	2451500	But then Jamie has to go and open her mouth and say that, so I'm thinking maybe it's us.
2453300	2454781	I just saw Victoria post about it.
2454861	2456521	We can be your trashy gossip site.
2457321	2460742	There's just not enough gossip in the game industry.
2461122	2465123	It's just, you know, we can make up speculative rumors about things, but...
2466363	2468824	I don't think there's really anything like that.
2469884	2472844	No one cares about gossip.
2474845	2475825	Just daylight rumors.
2476005	2479666	What are you talking about nobody in video games cares about gossip?
2480106	2480886	Are you high?
2481266	2483927	That is all people ever talk about is gossip.
2483947	2485207	No, they talk about rumors.
2486187	2487407	Okay, that's the same thing.
2487807	2489188	Where did Cliffy B go?
2489468	2490188	That's gossip.
2491028	2492390	Cliffy B went to Nintendo.
2492490	2495373	I have a friend who's uncle... Cliffy B went to go bang his wife, okay?
2495413	2496274	That's where he went.
2497075	2504664	The Wii U is causing all this turmoil within Nintendo and blah blah blah blah blah.
2504684	2505384	That's gossip.
2505925	2506545	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2529044	2534126	So why did we just talk about how Reggie Fils-Aimé looks like a wax figure?
2534606	2538107	There is two celebrity within video games, absolutely.
2538307	2543349	So let's start stalking him and find out, Reggie Fils-Aimé double parked today, woohoo!
2543789	2550451	No, there's a difference between the A-list of standard celebrity, you know what I mean?
2551232	2555173	And then there's a difference between the A-list of geek celebrity.
2556889	2565130	where we might care more about like say what Will Wheaton put on his blog because honestly he's a really good blogger.
2566271	2568631	How many of us can really give a shit about Lindsay Lohan?
2570791	2571512	I'm not raising my hand.
2571532	2574752	She was in Mean Girls and that is one of the best movies ever.
2575132	2581833	But my point, you know, who cares how many more kids, you know, Brangelina adopted?
2582353	2583053	Don't give a shit.
2583173	2584114	They can afford it good.
2584474	2585714	Let them raise all those damn children.
2586730	2587190	Don't care.
2587851	2597097	But I do care, you know, if, oh, well, so-and-so developer left whatever, you know, company, and that means no more of this, or he's going to be doing this.
2597157	2602400	That's shit we care about, you know, and that, and we do care about D-list celebrities like Kathy Griffin.
2602720	2603621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2619542	2621463	You know, because, you know, Felicia Day is pretty cool.
2621743	2624805	And, like, even, you know, the geeks on her friends list were all going, eee!
2625125	2629568	But you know there's people on her friends list that aren't in the whole geeks culture that look at that and go, who?
2630248	2636352	Well, you know, I've met some famous people before, and I was just like, oh, hi, how's it going?
2636812	2641234	And I completely geeked out when Wil Wheaton answered a question of mine on Twitter.
2641555	2641755	Mm-hmm.
2642715	2647197	I completely geeked out when I met wrestlers back when I was into wrestling.
2647357	2653419	And I had my moment earlier this year because I told everybody I knew that I got to shake Latrice Royale's hand.
2653799	2657161	And like, you know, I met Latrice Royale and she was gorgeous and all that.
2657461	2658641	And everybody's like, who?
2659141	2661823	And I'm like, it's a drag queen.
2661903	2662803	Hang my head in shame.
2663183	2671172	or my autograph from Kondo Koji or the other Koji, Igarashi.
2671772	2674515	Remember the picture that you took of me with him at E3?
2674636	2674976	I do.
2675456	2683665	I was like... And first of all, he was pretty floored that my horrible Japanese came across, you know, understandably, but still.
2684306	2684566	It was...
2685407	2688389	and you know running into Kojima three years in a row literally.
2689150	2694013	Stan in our chat room says everybody's or excuse me everyone's idea of a celebrity is different.
2694073	2700477	That's a very good point because I really got to address this topic carefully because I really don't want to sound like I have ego.
2701138	2713366	But I was very humbled and thankful that when I went to PAX East a couple years ago I did have people that like came up to me and like I had like a group of people that just came up to me and was like are you Rob?
2713466	2714767	You're Rob from Original Radio aren't you?
2714787	2715207	And I was like
2715767	2716648	Oh, yeah, I am.
2716848	2717028	Hi.
2717168	2722290	There was some random guy at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza who wanted to talk to us.
2723451	2724971	And I was like, oh my god.
2725732	2729453	It was as much of an OMG moment for me as it was for you, I'm sure.
2729533	2733235	Where it's like, oh, people actually do listen to this show.
2735077	2736518	It's kind of a humbling moment.
2736558	2737438	It's pretty awesome.
2737538	2739139	So, anyhow.
2741140	2745082	Stan in chat says, I made Latrice Royale in PlayStation Home.
2745663	2747103	Got a lot of weird looks.
2747264	2748544	You should just tell him to eat it!
2748864	2752887	I'll tell you when it was the most freaky for me was when I went to Alabama a few years ago.
2753727	2757549	And they were doing a tourney in Biloxi.
2757689	2758590	I think it was in Biloxi?
2759330	2759870	No, it was...
2762441	2763862	Yeah, I think it was in Biloxi, but anyway.
2764302	2768705	I showed up for some DDR tournament on a 5th Mix machine.
2770386	2774069	Because it was their new 5th Mix and they were all happy and we'd had it for a while, but it was all cool.
2774589	2776110	And they're like, you're here!
2777131	2778612	You said you'd be here, and you're here!
2778792	2780994	And I was like, hi everybody, nice to meet you.
2781294	2790320	And then I went to some 2DX party on a widescreen TV and had to play Karaoke Revolution and
2790820	2817246	it was pretty fun but I mean it's at the same time though it's I prefer it more when it leads to you know making friends with people no one cares about Loki I'm sorry Loki but you're a shut-in too you don't go out as much as Jamie and I do true you know what our listeners are my kind of people most everybody else in the universe I'm like don't touch don't don't touch me don't talk to me
2818860	2821222	Our listeners, I'm like, okay, you're allowed to touch me on the arm.
2823545	2830752	All right, Dave Falcon in our chat room says, I met the nature boy, Ric Flair, in a bathroom in a bar in Tampa and I asked him for his autograph.
2830812	2833174	I hope he didn't do that when he was peeing because that's a little awkward.
2833354	2834936	Like, there's time to talk to people.
2834956	2835837	Sign it with your urine.
2837939	2839060	I have his DNA.
2842045	2845935	That reminds me of this scene from Priscilla Queen of the Desert about Abba.
2846015	2846356	Never mind.
2846476	2846797	Never mind.
2847739	2848581	Let's move on with the news.
2848601	2849544	Ahem.
2850854	2867202	The ESRB, the Entertainment Rating Board, Entertainment Software Rating Board, they are trying to streamline the release of downloadable games doing a new rating service that is targeted for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, eShop, WiiWare, and Windows 8.
2868102	2870303	This service is no cost.
2870564	2875206	So that's a big incentive for people to use this because there's a lot of indie developers...
2875586	2878709	and people that don't have very big budgets making games for these platforms.
2879109	2880610	So this is a no cost service.
2880690	2888317	What the deal is, you do an online questionnaire and through this questionnaire you basically self identify the adult content.
2889286	2895249	What's interesting about this, the questionnaire will also rate a game in terms of what is shared.
2895989	2905553	So there's some new content descriptors in the game that will indicate that the game shares information, shares location, or interacts with users.
2907588	2910489	That's pretty awesome, I've got to say, actually.
2910709	2911729	I love this idea.
2911869	2916550	Even as, like, me, I love the fact that I will know exactly which games are going to want to share my location.
2916570	2916690	Cool.
2916710	2921611	Can we see those ratings on Facebook with what they're sharing?
2921871	2926231	I don't see why it wouldn't work if Facebook games were willing to put it on there.
2926271	2927492	No, Facebook, the website.
2927672	2933553	Oh, yeah, we should rate Facebook the website, but that's another ratings board that'll have to do that.
2934093	2934313	Okay.
2935493	2964455	apparently this is very similar to what PlayStation mobile games already have going forward on the rating system some are saying that could have been inspired by that so very cool I love that it's no cost let's just hope everybody's honest in those questionnaires I'm almost positive there will be a story in the near future about a game that is missing one of these labels that should have had it but we'll see it's an interesting step forward for now so I can't see how this is a bad idea looking forward to it
2965316	2966277	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
2967758	2968579	It's new!
2969600	2970400	You know what that means.
2971161	2972462	More Bimani.
2974103	2980889	So yeah, Konami has announced that the newest DDR game is just called Dance Dance Revolution.
2982030	2987274	And they haven't put a whole bunch of details about it, but they're doing their first location test at Tokyo Leisureland.
2989616	2991097	Is that next Friday, I think it is?
2991578	2992178	It's already happened.
2992198	2993079	They already have the songs.
2993119	2993319	Yeah.
2994660	3000003	So yeah, there's a location test page and everything up now, but isn't it supposed to do all of its updates over the internet?
3002084	3003605	Yeah, some of the tweets were indicating that.
3004205	3015591	Like, that I guess they're calling it Dance Dance Revolution because they're not envisioning that there will ever be a second mix or a third mix, that it's just going to be one mix that can be constantly updated.
3016144	3022190	Yeah, it actually, there's a quote on here from SoInLove about future DVR series.
3022270	3029297	I talked with Usan, and they named this version as just DVR because they will update it, but no new versions.
3031479	3033762	And I think that's an English-y post, but still.
3035154	3037677	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3053135	3054857	And we saw how well that worked out.
3055137	3059082	It tanked, and they said, oh, but we're going to provide lots of DLC for it.
3059483	3061345	They provide some DLC, and then it's done.
3062727	3062967	Nothing.
3063428	3066652	You get the game dirt cheap now, and there's no DLC support for it.
3068484	3073187	So, yeah, I see that totally happening with this, where they're going to have some DLC for it.
3073227	3078091	And here's what I want to know, is if they're going to constantly update this game, then how are they going to sell new games?
3078111	3083054	Do they just want to make profit off it anymore, or are they going to sell DLC to arcades?
3083694	3088798	So you're going to have some arcades that have these extra songs, and some arcades that don't have these extra songs, or...
3089389	3092590	I think that's how it would have to work is selling DLC to the arcades.
3092710	3095671	I kind of think it's a great idea, but remember, this is Japan.
3095711	3097352	This is not something that's being tested here.
3097392	3108256	This is a very Japanese-centric thing, and for a Japanese arcade where you have karaoke booths that have their own songs and what have you, I could actually see this really working, and yes, I think it would give arcades some identity.
3108276	3114278	They've tried it with Tekken, I want to say, was one of the games that they're going to have DLC for that arcades are going to have to pay for or something like that.
3115038	3115159	Um...
3116699	3125221	The problem is, though, is like, so that basically kind of excludes all of the other territories other than Japan because a lot of these can't connect to EMUs.
3127041	3133603	So they're going to be stuck with basically the default song list, which may not be a bad thing, but it's just kind of, what's the incentive?
3134143	3142704	You put out things that aren't specifically Japan licensed for that first release, but all the DLC will have Japan only licenses.
3143124	3145565	You know, that's what I see happening.
3147526	3149268	Jamie, what do you think about a reboot of DDR?
3151130	3151570	Why not?
3152251	3154013	I mean, really, I'm kind of like, eh.
3154894	3155715	But I'll play it.
3156836	3160560	I mean, I always play the new stuff when it comes out, but I kind of hit a point where I stopped caring.
3161741	3162702	I'm good for them.
3162742	3163363	I hope it works.
3163752	3167153	Let's be honest, they've rebooted DDR like four or five times already.
3167913	3171315	I honestly think Konami doesn't understand what makes DDR good.
3171675	3175536	And so, you know, with Extreme, remember, we're starting all over again.
3176016	3179097	And then they had Supernova, and that was kind of another reboot.
3179117	3181318	And then they had the X series, which is kind of a reboot.
3181338	3183779	They did three games into that, and now they're rebooting it again.
3184599	3188181	I mean, it's like, do you guys not know what fucking makes these games good?
3188602	3189002	Is that it?
3189502	3196206	You're just kind of like, well, we're just gonna draw straws here until we figure out why this is selling, you know, or why people are playing it or not playing it.
3196326	3201189	They had a strong formula for a while and people were excited and then they changed it.
3202029	3231729	which I think that that might have been you know because I mean keep in mind how long have the guitar freaks and drum mania still been going on how popular is pop and music still pop and music is way popular and just because they've kept their formula they haven't kept trying to redesign it they haven't tried to reinvent it and that's I think the problem they're doing with DDR is that they've gotten away from they're trying to make it edgy trying to keep it new but really it's that quirky classic that people like
3232389	3234010	I'm kind of with Jamie on this.
3234150	3237712	I said this for years when we were mostly music-based.
3237792	3246557	I said DDR really does need to reinvent itself, and I don't think Supernova or X really were a reinvention whatsoever.
3247417	3249859	None of it really did anything to push the franchise forward.
3250439	3263208	So I'm a little bit hopeful that if they have to go back and put in this infrastructure to support DLC for arcades and all that, maybe they're going to approach other ideas for the game as well, like something to make it a little more competitive or some of this new stuff.
3263668	3269632	I mean, I think a creative reboot would be a great idea, but I don't know if that's really what we're getting with this game.
3270093	3271514	But kind of like Jamie's...
3272014	3272775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3291394	3291915	Let's put it this way.
3291935	3297540	If they're not charging for that DLC, then what's the real incentive for them to do it anyways?
3298181	3300943	Because they're not helping themselves.
3301123	3302645	They're not going to sell any more games.
3305097	3310062	If they are charging for DLC, then it all comes down to how much is this stuff costing?
3310142	3314266	Because obviously in an arcade machine, we're not talking like $5 a song DLC.
3314306	3319791	We're talking probably like, you know, a couple hundred dollars or, you know, whatever for these songs.
3319911	3321773	And if arcade owners back there, you know,
3322854	3324396	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3339452	3340433	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3357236	3362079	This is sort of what I was talking about a lot earlier with Tekken 3.
3364101	3366923	Because people, when Tekken 3 came out, I worked at a Namco arcade.
3367483	3371666	And we had people always coming in saying, how many more matches until we unlock somebody?
3372467	3374808	You know, even though I think they were all on a date cycle.
3375389	3376710	You know, who's the next person?
3376750	3378171	Well, in Japan they got this person.
3378211	3379291	We must be different here.
3379672	3381093	Which they ended up being different.
3382033	3385155	And, you know, that worked for DDR where you would unlock things.
3385176	3385836	Yeah.
3386876	3402084	and I really wish that they would go back to something like that I mean if they're gonna do DLC updates it should still be unlockable stuff you know to keep that excitement to keep people feeling like there's a sense of achievement that it's a community-wide effort
3402659	3420665	that was always the best part about Max 2 was that community part so I'm all for that I will withhold judgment until I actually get to play it which may not be anytime soon if recent DDR releases are any sign but I hope for the best what else can I say
3422088	3423369	Let's move on with news, Loki.
3425451	3426331	So let's see.
3426651	3433136	Let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And honestly, this news doesn't surprise me at all.
3434817	3441722	So the rumor is that the Wii U is not going to launch with all the features on the system.
3442623	3445425	Kind of sound a little familiar with Nintendo's kind of MO.
3446345	3458231	Apparently they're seeing right now that the features including Miiverse and the near field communication that they won't be on the actual system.
3458271	3461993	You're going to have to download Miiverse in order to actually have it.
3463134	3464895	Which kind of seems a little odd to me.
3464935	3467816	Wasn't that supposed to be what you see when you turn on your Wii U?
3467856	3468076	Yeah.
3469377	3470217	That's weird.
3471418	3471518	Um...
3473124	3481107	And I guess, you know, obviously later on they're going to add some other support and stuff for multiple gamepads and that kind of thing, which makes no sense right now because no games use it.
3481687	3488349	But and even the near field of communication stuff doesn't really make any sense to have that right now because nothing uses it.
3488909	3506265	But Miiverse is a little weird that that wouldn't be on the actual console because, I don't know, they're saying that it's possible that it won't be available at launch because considering third parties can't access it right now.
3508012	3511934	So... Hold on, let me get this straight here.
3511954	3513295	How are they going to have any games incorporated?
3513735	3514436	Exactly.
3514476	3515236	Let me get this straight here.
3515576	3521440	So they have this thing that's supposed to tie into these games, but no games can tie into it.
3521660	3525282	In fact, it's kind of funny that that's true because third-party games can access it.
3525782	3535648	One of the big games that they showed this whole Miiverse thing was with Zombie U. So that was all bullshit that they were kind of pushing our way?
3535668	3535888	I mean...
3537316	3537619	I don't know
3540337	3546101	I think it's kind of retarded that you have a Nintendo system launch without all the features in there.
3546141	3547082	Remember the 3DS?
3547482	3548503	Where was the web browser?
3548863	3550605	Oh, it didn't come out until months after.
3551926	3553707	It's like, what?
3554147	3558010	You're selling me this broken piece of shit that you're going to patch in the stuff later on?
3558450	3563174	Why don't you delay the release a little bit and have it done?
3563814	3566296	Why bother pushing this out when stuff isn't done yet?
3566836	3571078	or, I don't know, this is a main feature of the console and you haven't fucking finished it yet?
3571759	3574820	It's not that complicated of a piece of software.
3575941	3576921	But it is all rumor.
3577682	3578242	It's all rumor.
3578322	3583865	I mean, me versus me could be also one of those things that, like, they're gonna, like, quote-unquote, patch in day one.
3584365	3587367	Like, it could be one of those things that, like, they're really working right up to the last minute.
3587447	3590369	I mean, I'm totally theorizing, just throwing it out there.
3591229	3592470	Me vs. One Thing Near Field Communication
3606989	3635555	I have to say as much as this opinion may not be popular there's been other Nintendo stuff in the past where they slowly unraveled things like I seem to remember the original DS and the whole like downloading demos and all this that wasn't there when the system first launched that was something that came up later and the whole internet connectivity and it was like that feature was just waiting in your DS the whole time to be enabled so if there's stuff like that that we don't yet know about that's kind of hiding and waiting in the Wii U that's
3636035	3636856	Thanks for watching!
3652939	3661681	and, oh, maybe later on we'll have a way that you can store things, you know, on your SD memory card instead of just backing up your saves on that.
3661961	3667943	Or, oh, I don't know, how about we just, you know, have a feature now where you can download digital copies of the games.
3667963	3670203	I mean, they're so far behind.
3670223	3673524	I mean, all these other companies have been doing this for a long time.
3673984	3676625	And it's just like they push it out to their customers like...
3677205	3678486	Oh, look at what Nintendo's doing.
3678526	3681967	We're offering demos of games and everyone's like, fuck yeah, it's amazing.
3681987	3683947	This is awfully new technology.
3684007	3687369	It's like, no, it's been fucking done for years now.
3687649	3689509	They were doing demos on the PlayStation 1.
3690270	3694131	And yet, for some reason, Nintendo is unable to give you a demo of anything.
3695242	3713236	I think Nintendo's big thing is that they've been trying to avoid anything that's going to damage, not necessarily their reputation or their brand, but avoid ways for pirating, avoid ways for region outsourcing, not outsourcing is not the word I'm thinking of, but
3713636	3718959	You know, going outside the region, avoiding incidents for online chat.
3719820	3725062	They're really, really trying, I think, way too hard to preserve their brand.
3726103	3734928	And they're sacrificing a lot of the options that people have come to expect from a modern day gaming system for the sake of that little neurosis, I guess.
3735814	3740395	Well, let me get into this next story, because it's almost right up the same alley of what we've been talking about here.
3740635	3750037	And this really caught wildfire all over the internet, because Origin, the ever-popular EA service, updated their privacy policy.
3750517	3754338	And this has a lot of people wondering, how exactly does Origin play into the Wii U?
3754898	3763720	Because in the new policy, it says, "...by signing up to play EA's titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA."
3764580	3774544	Information transferred to EA includes your Mii information, email address, Nintendo Network ID, friends list, country, language, and date of birth.
3775625	3784508	So this seems to confirm that Origin will be a part of how you're going to play EA games on Wii U. But my thought is, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3784988	3790871	Because before we start saying, oh my god, it's going to be Origin on the Wii U, which would be dreadful news indeed.
3790891	3790971	Yeah.
3791651	3795093	If I were to see that Origin logo pop up on the Wii U, I'd be like, it's over.
3795594	3798816	Nintendo did not convince me they understand online.
3798856	3799396	This is done.
3799536	3799896	I'm done.
3800677	3808422	But hold on a minute because EA and your Origin account, they also interact with your Xbox 360 account and your PlayStation 3 account.
3808982	3809743	And your Wii.
3810683	3811604	Oh, and your original Wii.
3811624	3811924	That's right.
3811964	3812264	They do.
3812925	3817288	And all of that kind of interfaces in that EA console when you go on there.
3818769	3819029	So...
3821576	3823998	I mean, hopefully this isn't much different.
3824339	3825280	I don't think it's any different.
3825400	3832427	Especially like, okay, maybe it just wants the me information, so put your little picture on the origin account or whatever, but I don't think that's a huge deal.
3832907	3834208	Some other people are learning out of this.
3834228	3835390	Make sure you haven't done penis face.
3835550	3843798	Yeah, to also draw out of this, the Nintendo Network ID is seemingly telling, that's a huge part of it, that where's the friend code?
3844398	3873482	so maybe they finally are doing some type of universal ID is that an ID name that I get to pick or is that a Nintendo Network ID number I don't know we shall soon see so of course all the big blogs reaching out to Nintendo for comment but they're not saying anything right now I wouldn't panic I don't think this means it's Origin on Wii U at least I hope not because Origin is terrible and it will be a terrible thing for the Wii U if that happens they would never do that
3874764	3879056	I would not buy Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U if it has the origin tie-in.
3879076	3880239	There's literally no point.
3882729	3884130	It's definitely going to have Origin.
3884170	3886590	Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U will have Origin.
3888951	3889911	But in what capacity?
3889971	3891892	I mean, on the Xbox 360, you don't see it.
3891912	3892972	It's just like the Xbox 360.
3893112	3902775	Okay, that's fine then because what it's doing, it's talking to Origin's servers to get your Galaxy information and get some of that stuff and update your stuff on the EA social Bioware site or whatever.
3903235	3906736	That's fine because the connectivity isn't happening through Origin.
3907236	3908317	Thanks for watching!
3926744	3949501	but I ran it through Steam I never had a problem it wouldn't connect to the servers right when I loaded it up but I could log in I'm not even getting the option anymore with my Mass Effect 3 which if it was the patch I'm just saying but I think Origin has something to do with it too even though I'm connecting just fine through Origin so they just need to get their shit together
3949881	3954086	Alright, well, unfortunately these are things we just aren't going to know until the Wii U actually comes out.
3954406	3955928	So, meanwhile, more news.
3956088	3956629	DarkSakura.
3958021	3961542	Well, hopefully something better than freaking Origin.
3962162	3964703	How about Super Mario 64?
3966744	3969785	16 years since this game has come out.
3970305	3972346	My husband and I used to play a crap ton of it.
3972766	3979908	Well, now there is a PC mod for Super Mario 64 that lets you play co-op online.
3980688	3982989	It was modded by Skellux.
3983729	3984750	S-K-E-L-U-X
3985410	3985910	Super Mario Star Road
4005087	4009830	But this one keeps the level design and everything, but makes it co-op.
4012452	4014734	You're not playing as Luigi, though, however.
4015394	4017876	You're playing as sort of a recolored Mario.
4018296	4019677	I mean... Luigi.
4021358	4025801	But it's not like the taller... It's like a gray Mario, gray and red Mario.
4027002	4028523	So, kind of like a palette swap.
4029243	4030764	But hey, it's cool.
4033106	4034647	I actually want to check this out.
4036866	4039848	Oh god, Tigerclaw in our chatroom is telling me, Rob, it's been done.
4040108	4040808	No!
4041329	4041989	No!
4042909	4043690	It's the internet.
4043710	4044690	Of course it's been done.
4046932	4054076	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that are coming to a store near you, hopefully with less dubstep.
4055381	4058623	We've got a few games coming out this week since we're in the fourth quarter.
4059583	4060403	So let's start off.
4061144	4064185	They're doing some re-releases of stuff.
4064405	4070508	They have the Namco Museum DS and Pac-Man World 3 bundled together on one DS cart.
4070688	4071688	So that's coming out.
4072128	4077031	Also Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur 4 are being bundled together on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4078791	4098084	uh we've got Assassin's Creed 3 on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and on PC Thundercats on the Nintendo DS Transformers wow hey it's probably based off the new Thundercats series which is probably not that good uh Thundercat or Thundercats

4262294	4266477	and Tales of... Are you supposed to say Zillia or Shillia?
4266517	4268819	Because it's an X. Exilia?
4268959	4270160	I think it's Tales of Shillia.
4270180	4271061	I think it would be Zillia.
4271461	4271841	Zillia?
4272181	4272662	Alright, whatever.
4272722	4275384	Tales of Zillia 2 is out this week.
4275504	4279486	And there's even a version that comes with a new DualShock controller and all this stuff.

4310367	4310787	Oh, nose.
4311108	4311568	Hold on.
4312829	4313649	As I had the list up.

4330032	4332314	Sports Champions 2 for PS3.

4339159	4339899	Stupid thing.
4342461	4343042	November...
4345123	4349605	On the first, we have WWE 13 for a number of systems.
4350086	4357630	On the second, Football Manager 2013, Just Dance 4, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Nike Plus Connect Training, Silent Hill Book of Memories.
4358130	4358410	That's it.
4361847	4363068	Alrighty.
4363128	4366632	Just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4366752	4368353	What did DarkSakura pick this week?
4368894	4370215	Find out after two more stories.
4370716	4370956	Loki.
4371236	4378243	Well, it's unfortunate that we have to report on more closures and layoffs, but...
4378983	4383966	Zynga has laid off 5% of their workforce, kind of a restructuring that they're doing.
4384606	4398073	They let go roughly 3,200 employees, and with that, they've closed Zynga's Boston studio, and also the studios in Japan and UK are being kind of slated for...
4398633	4399894	Shutdown soon.
4400855	4402356	Also, the Austin office.
4403937	4406480	They've laid off quite a few people there.
4407340	4413745	And they've also shut down, I guess, 13 of their older games.
4414286	4420371	And what they quote, significantly reducing their investment in The Ville.
4421251	4429097	Probably a good thing being since they're being sued by EA for The Ville, so it sounds like the outlook on that is not too favorable.
4432299	4433280	That's kind of disappointing.
4433420	4434341	You know what Dan told me?
4435021	4437563	He said that their stock right now is lower than RadioShack.
4439004	4439244	Ouch!
4439845	4441286	Yeah, that's pretty bad.
4445350	4448393	Alright, I got one story for you too.
4448833	4451816	By the way, that was shady that they did that during the whole Apple conference.
4452276	4454759	I don't, like a lot of people assume that was intentional.
4455339	4456701	Maybe it really wasn't.
4456801	4463727	Just to give Zynga what little shred of doubt I can, maybe that actually wasn't intentional that they did it during the Apple conference.
4463747	4465949	Because seriously, how are you going to hide something like that?
4466169	4467490	You think the internet wouldn't notice?
4468407	4469889	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4483061	4484163	Well, you know, I don't know.
4484543	4485925	I'm trying to judge my Facebook.
4485985	4489610	Some people went and got it the day it came out, and they're actually really excited about it.
4489670	4490732	Like, they're really enjoying it.
4490832	4491593	So, I don't know.
4492274	4498383	I'm going to give it a couple months before that whole super sale is done at the end of January to see if it's something I really need.
4498503	4498703	But...
4499952	4502234	I bet you're dying to know, what about the games?
4502634	4504095	What are the games that come with Windows 8?
4504476	4506337	Well, let's tell you about the new games with Windows 8.
4506898	4512982	Microsoft Solitaire Collection is one of the games in Windows 8, which of course, it's Windows, it's gotta have Solitaire, right?
4513383	4515444	Remember, these all have achievements and stuff too.
4517385	4522788	There's like Klondike Solitaire and Pyramid and all the stuff you'd be used to.
4523168	4525609	Minesweeper is back in Windows 8.
4525889	4527290	But here's the crazy part.
4528090	4530011	Minesweeper now has an adventure mode.
4531291	4531531	What?
4531892	4532452	No one care.
4532532	4533432	Look at the screenshot.
4533532	4536033	It's like little explorer dude going through the cave.
4536534	4536774	Yep.
4537634	4538334	Hey, you know what?
4538775	4543016	As much as you say no one care, I gotta say it looks better.
4543036	4544077	Mr. Driller did it better.
4544097	4544337	Yeah.
4547382	4547883	Whatever.
4548723	4549964	Other games within the Windows 8.
4550184	4557229	Microsoft Mahjong, which I think they've kind of been including ever since Shanghai, the old PC game was popular.
4557249	4558250	I love Mahjong.
4559691	4560291	Wordament.
4561286	4561446	Adera
4578303	4584866	It's kind of got like a little story that goes with it, a stone and sorcery magic type game, but it's more like a puzzler.
4584966	4586567	Don't get like a, you know, I don't know.
4587087	4590169	But yeah, it's like a very simple type of adventure game.
4590649	4592470	So that's another free Windows 8 game.
4592490	4593030	So there you go.
4593411	4598033	We've come a long way since the days of just good old solitaire with the bouncing card when you finish, right?
4598533	4599234	You know what, Rob?
4599535	4603460	The moment that you said that, my brain instantly went to, like, a Virginia Slims ad.
4604461	4604881	How so?
4604981	4611069	With, like, gamers, you know, sitting around making shit faces at, you know, Windows 8.
4611229	4613492	And it has, you've come a long way, baby.
4616575	4617136	and DarkSakura.com.
4638345	4643477	You, listen, classic game, play, now.
4644038	4645581	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4646519	4654886	Classic Game of the Week is Panzer Dragoon, which I thought that I had done it before, but I had done Saga, or RPG as we got it.
4656767	4657828	I'm sorry, as it came out in Japan.
4658209	4662032	So Panzer Dragoon is a rail shooter by Team Andromeda.
4662212	4663753	It came out on the Saturn in 1995.
4664814	4667356	And then later on there were other versions for PC, PS2.
4668177	4672920	And it came as a bonus in Panzer Dragoon Order on Xbox.
4673942	4681835	So, you basically play as Kale Fluge, who is unnamed in the US version.
4683696	4687200	and basically you just go through and you shoot stuff.
4687821	4689503	But the game's freaking gorgeous.
4690084	4696571	I mean, people gave the Saturn shit for its 3D, and yeah, it didn't do 3D as good as the PlayStation did.
4697052	4703459	It was built originally as a 2D machine, but this game really illustrated what you could do with the Saturn.
4705781	4710785	So basically, you have machines and monsters as your enemies.
4711766	4714868	And it's sort of like a post-apocalyptic fantasy world.
4717950	4724175	So you have to go through, you've got the different boss battles that actually pause the game before the boss battle.
4724956	4731081	And then you have X and Y axes that you can move across on for those boss battles.
4731961	4739022	Um, but basically you can look all the way around, I mean, your enemies are coming from everywhere, but you're still on rails.
4741383	4747744	Um, so you've got two weapons, you have a handgun, and then you have a homing laser that your dragon fires.
4748664	4756626	It has six levels, each one about five minutes, and then there's a boss battle, and the sixth, though, is a special boss battle, so...
4758584	4767650	I have to say that, just going back into this one, now, I played a little bit of it, but you know how I get with certain games.
4767690	4768591	I get motion sick.
4768611	4769912	This is one that made me motion sick.
4771368	4776690	However, since this was a Sega game, of course it was out on the Saturn.
4778591	4783494	It started off, though, as a different project.
4783734	4790837	They said they were trying to develop a shoot-em-up game, and it eventually evolved into Panzer Dragoon.
4792657	4820821	so yeah pretty awesome game but they were under a big time frame for actually developing it and they were the original name of the game was actually Kikoryu which is Armored Dragon but they wanted to pick something that sounded a little bit more exciting so they picked a German name Panzer Dragoon and there you go
4822881	4823342	That's it?
4824122	4824543	That's it.
4824563	4826385	What a pretty game, though, especially for its time.
4826405	4827326	That's a gorgeous game.
4828087	4830629	Well, it was actually named the best Saturn game of 1995 by EGM.
4830649	4830729	R.I.P.
4837023	4845769	and this game also sold well enough that they could do Panzer Dragoons Vi which of course is keeping with that German naming.
4847570	4853134	It was also give it one up, give it a retro review of 8 out of 10.
4855215	4856436	So, not bad.
4857216	4857596	Alright.
4858457	4860518	There it is, Panzer Dragoon, your classic game of the week.
4860538	4861899	Good pick, DarkSakura, good pick.
4862380	4862940	Well, thank Dan.
4863619	4864239	Good pick, Dan.
4864299	4864699	Good pick.
4865620	4867621	I was like, what should I pick?
4867721	4868941	You can bring Dan back to the show.
4868981	4870081	We have a fourth mic now.
4870802	4874463	Thanks to the kind, benevolent people at PodCulture.
4874563	4877124	If you have Dan all the time, then it's not special.
4877304	4878144	Must be like my life.
4878264	4878484	Anyway.
4883166	4884327	All right.
4884767	4886809	That's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.
4886849	4889471	We have a very busy Part B when we come back.
4890472	4899379	We're going to do some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, and listless all when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4905894	4908776	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4908876	4917582	We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 28th of 2012, with the 479th episode of our show.
4917742	4923846	Getting into Part B, and we'll be doing some rapid-fire news and the Fugle Question of the Week and a special list list tonight.
4923886	4928508	But first, we have some breaking news to start off Part B. Breaking news.
4928529	4928989	Breaking news.
4929958	4934820	The 8th Annual Podcast Award nominees are in at podcastawards.com and we got nominated!
4950933	4965439	Orange Launch Radio is a nominee for Best Gaming and there's 10 shows in the gaming category including a couple that also got some bigger nominations for People's Choice and Best Produced so it's going to be some big competition this year and
4965919	4966860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4989353	4991796	Obviously, we would really like it very much if it's us.
4991816	4993138	A specific indie to win, yeah.
4993158	4995520	Yes, we very much want this specific indie to win.
4995880	4999024	However, if we can't, we really hope one of the indies takes it.
4999124	5001366	So, good luck to the indies in here.
5001426	5003989	As far as the corp cast goes, you're going down.
5005591	5006352	So, podcastwords.com.
5006372	5007333	Power to the people, yo.
5007373	5007994	Power to the people.
5009055	5010096	The daily voting, and I...
5010456	5015181	I don't know all of those shows, so I apologize if you are an indie show and I did not name you specifically.
5015261	5020526	I will do more research before voting opens on November 1st is when the voting opens.
5020906	5021967	So there you go.
5022768	5030175	We will be trying to whore for your votes like crazy come November 1st because we are going to need them.
5030195	5031717	And you can vote every day.
5032097	5035460	Yes, you can vote every day, so we will be reminding you every day, so please help.
5035520	5043826	Remember, we don't ask for money, we don't ask for subscriptions, we don't have a plus feed or something that you pay extra money to get.
5044247	5048590	All we want, we want your votes to help us spread the word.
5049111	5054615	I'm not saying that, you know, obviously we want legit votes, but they do allow one vote per email address.
5055241	5059964	TigerClaw in chat says, Rob, aren't you torn that Horde House did not get nominated?
5060604	5067888	Actually, it's much easier this way because then I only have to champion for one show to get votes because that would be weird if the other show had gotten nominated.
5068449	5076913	I did notice it was interesting that The Instance wasn't nominated because I know they've been nominated almost every year so maybe they didn't go for it this year.
5076973	5077333	I don't know.
5078234	5083357	Also, Four Player Podcast, they've had the lock on this thing for like three, four years because they have a huge...
5083937	5086080	Huge fan community and they're very rabid.
5086480	5088042	They were not eligible this year.
5088162	5092687	That's why they're not nominated because they won the biggest of the big awards last year and there's some weird rules.
5092767	5095751	So they'll be back next year guaranteed.
5095831	5100436	So if there's any year we actually stand a chance in hell to win, it's going to be this year.
5100556	5104341	So please throw us your votes come November 1st.
5105848	5106308	There you go.
5106749	5112173	And unfortunately, I also have to say this, no other VOG show nominated I looked.
5112513	5126865	I was a little depressed because I know I nominated some, but I guess it was just a lot of competition or what have you, and we were whoring the nominations quite a bit, so hopefully we were able to catch some eyes there.
5127786	5131649	But we're going to do our best to represent VOG and try to win it for us.
5131729	5132950	Like the whores we are.
5134531	5136233	So there you go.
5136293	5138535	Thank you guys very much for helping that happen.
5138615	5139976	Really, really, really, really appreciate it.
5139996	5143019	And lots of celebratory stuff in chat right now.
5143059	5143660	I appreciate it.
5143960	5146903	Acidic Vampire says, will you pay me to vote for you?
5148885	5150206	We'll pay you in hugs and kisses.
5151343	5153244	We are not like the presidential nominees.
5153284	5154904	Hello, we don't pay people for votes.
5156764	5162306	Taiki says, fuck the podcast awards after irreligiosophy got snubbed twice.
5162686	5170008	Well, you know, I've kind of had some give and take feelings about the podcast awards because let's be real, it is a huge popularity contest.
5170068	5171929	However, it's great promotion.
5171989	5172709	I'm not going to lie.
5172749	5173809	It's great promotion.
5173889	5175530	So we've got to do the best we can.
5176030	5176470	So there you go.
5177710	5181433	Let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick gaming news for you guys.
5181913	5182654	Loki, start us off.
5182874	5190038	So if you like collectible figures, there's going to be some new vinyl figures coming out from Funko Pop.
5191059	5196022	They've got some Halo 4 figures and very chibi looking.
5196162	5203607	They've got Cortana and it looks like Master Chief and a couple other of the Spartans.
5203647	5206529	They've got a red Spartan and a blue Spartan.
5207570	5233586	so those should be coming soon I'd get a red one but make him purple so it could be donut or pink yes that'd be pretty cool and I'm sure you could paint your own Spartan if you want to but I believe those are going to be available soon if they're not already available I mean they've got to be probably available now since Halo comes out in a week
5235486	5236527	Man, it's already a week?
5237187	5237708	Crazy.
5239709	5241770	Oh yeah, that's right, because it's election day that it comes out.
5242330	5242670	Crazy.
5243311	5245052	Wow, election day is right around the corner.
5246373	5247974	And then all this bullshit will be over.
5249054	5250615	Where is my mailing bell?
5250655	5251836	I haven't gotten that.
5252176	5252636	I got mine.
5252676	5252836	Really?
5252856	5253597	Because Alan got his.
5254097	5255278	I got mine like two weeks ago.
5257850	5272715	um okay so Team Fortress 2 they're doing some fun stuff for Halloween of course um Scream Fortress is coming back and what would come with you know your staple Halloween thing why of course zombies zombies would come
5273475	5280021	and, you know, they've got different events going on including Haunted, King of the Hill matches.
5280321	5287547	Also, they've got, I guess, a game, what was it, BombinupCon?
5289248	5291589	and some wizards and stuff.
5291649	5293210	It's all, of course, Halloween themed.
5293870	5301352	And they're going to have a brand new man versus machine mission called Wave 666, which will have undead robot enemies.
5302573	5303213	So, neat.
5303473	5308795	And I'm sure there's some unique hats to be had there because why wouldn't they have unique hats?
5310115	5310415	And then...
5312236	5312536	Uh oh, Loki.
5312557	5312677	Uh oh.
5312717	5314178	You know what you said, didn't you?
5314198	5315800	You said it.
5315840	5315980	Uh oh.
5340277	5342860	It came on my radio, I said, last week.
5343040	5344421	It's like Pee Wee's Playhouse.
5344481	5347445	Whenever somebody says the secret word, you just have to start, you just have to get down.
5347825	5353051	I love that gif that's out there, by the way, of the football player that's getting down doing the Gangnam Style dance.
5355533	5383882	um they're saying other artists that are going to be coming soon Justin Bieber, One Direction, LMFAO and um yeah that's all they've mentioned so far did you hear about the hacking of Justin Bieber's twitter that was fucked up oh my god that was so fucked up I am sorry that was amazing it's one of those things like you're laughing at and then you're like oh my god I'm going to hell for laughing at this because this is terrible alright repeat it for those that may not have heard
5384162	5392507	So I think it was 4chan people that did it, hacked Justin Bieber's Twitter and posted that he had cancer and was going bald from his treatments.
5393028	5401513	So all these girls started shaving their head and posting little signs that said bald for Bieber.
5401533	5403514	Yeah.
5403835	5405856	That is messed up.
5405876	5407097	That's hilarious.
5407277	5410719	Just goes to show the whole sheep thing, you know?
5411226	5412470	That's hilarious.
5413253	5417266	And then they're probably disappointed when he's not really dying from cancer.
5418951	5420192	Alright, let's move on.
5421273	5423015	Going to news about the Commodore 64.
5423755	5424556	Yeah, you heard me.
5424856	5425177	Commodore 64.
5426017	5430001	Super Crate Box is a game that's been out there and it's turned two this past week.
5430461	5432763	And they did a free iOS version to celebrate.
5432803	5441551	However, what's awesome, they're doing a game called Super Bread Box that's going to be an adaptation of the game on the Commodore 64 by the guys who did C64 Cannibalt.
5443913	5472129	C64Ball So there's already a YouTube out there This is going to be available, they say, in early December Check out that awesome soundtrack going into this God, the C64 was so great Flamethrower Every game needs a flamethrower A brand new website launched this week that has a lot of people excited Polygon.com finally officially launched this week
5472669	5492311	and it's notable because there's a lot of like game journalists like people that were big on Joystick before and Kotaku before and some other websites that kind of all came together to form this website and I saw a lot of people on Twitter that were kind of spazzing about the website launching and you know it's a nice looking website I don't know Jamie have you seen this website at all yet?
5493011	5494692	How do you feel about their design choices?
5518184	5525267	The other problem with that being too is that you're going to deal with different resolutions and this is clearly optimized for max resolution.
5526148	5527948	So it's not going to work for everybody.
5528229	5528409	Right.
5528549	5529989	The mobile site's really good looking though.
5530109	5530650	I will say that.
5530990	5532590	So congrats to them for finally starting this.
5532610	5534271	But I am going to say one little thing.
5534371	5537272	I am going to dog on this here because we do that.
5538793	5542235	I don't get the whole documentary and making of stuff.
5542415	5544396	That's a little too much ego for me.
5544416	5545116	A little smug.
5545796	5546817	It is a little smug.
5546877	5548597	It's very smug.
5548677	5551998	All these little documentaries about the launching of the website and the making of the website.
5552138	5553679	No one gives a fuck, except for you.
5553899	5557020	That shit should be organic.
5557180	5562342	This feels forced, and it makes me not want to like your website.
5562402	5563343	I'm just being perfectly honest.
5563663	5568304	Now, I do like the writing, and I like a lot of the people that are there, and ultimately that wins out.
5568664	5572606	But I gotta say, all that self-serving bullshit is kinda...
5574147	5578229	That'd be like hosting an awards ceremony where you're going to award yourself for being so awesome.
5578729	5580290	I mean, I'm sure that's right around the corner.
5580970	5582531	Polygon's awards for Polygon.
5585552	5591175	And realize that we just told people to please go vote for us in an online awards ceremony, but I'm sorry.
5591215	5596178	Yeah, but I don't have a fucking documentary about... Let me start a new website.
5596638	5598919	I'm going to create a documentary about starting said website.
5599940	5611087	But really to go back to this though is that their design, I like consistency.
5611448	5614149	You have to have consistency with a good website.
5614910	5619353	And with it switching back and forth, you're really not giving it enough consistency.
5619433	5626477	Plus you're sacrificing memory for people who may not be optimized to use your site.
5628118	5631203	I prefer it to keep a constant format.
5631363	5635408	I like the large splash image up at the top and then the sight going into it.
5635488	5638613	I like the three columnular point of view.
5638953	5641657	I just think that you need to pick a style and stick with it.
5642539	5644541	But at the end of the day, of course, the writing is the most important.
5644621	5646402	And they do have some really interesting in-depth articles.
5646422	5648303	Writing doesn't do anything if you can't find shit.
5651425	5651906	Snap.
5652686	5652986	All right.
5654167	5656409	Let's move on to one other quick thing I want to get out here.
5656849	5663574	Jason, one of our co-hosts, we sometimes have a guest host here on the show, and our lovely webmaster of OrangeOnStreet.com wanted me to plug this.
5664014	5665395	And to this I say, but of course.
5666255	5668197	How many of you are fans of the website GitHub.com?
5668777	5673421	GitHub's a pretty awesome site for developers, programmers, and basically nerds.
5673581	5674521	Let's be honest.
5674581	5675522	It's a super nerd site.
5675902	5680606	Well, GitHub is going to be doing a game jam of their very own.
5681467	5688052	They have the entire month of November to create a web-based game, and it's got to be loosely built around one of these themes.
5688692	5714254	forking that's forking like a spoon or a fork or forks branching or branches cloning or clones pushing or pulling what do we mean loosely based they mean loosely based like you could do a first-person shooter where you throw forks and so on and so on some of the prizes shiny new iPads with retina displays ooh ah github swag and so forth and you know featuring on the github blog
5714594	5715294	Game Moth Game Moth
5742529	5746812	I was thinking of this little moth with big rainbow wings flying around to ABBA.
5748053	5748373	Awesome.
5748813	5749714	Alright, well that's all I have.
5749754	5751195	DarkSakura, what's up next for you?
5752216	5753356	I have more stuff.
5754737	5755758	And a voice that's failing.
5756839	5759941	Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition is coming out for PC for $19.90.
5760121	5763844	It has warp zones.
5765165	5765945	Yeah, warp zones.
5766205	5766525	Okay.
5767606	5791650	then um there is a uh uh nine minutes of footage up for the Mass Effect 3 uh prequel uh which is uh Paragon Lost which I think I'm like the only Mass Effect fan that's really excited about this so I don't know I'm gonna check it out it's Vega it's about Vega but oh hi Mariko um so uh you've got Freddie Prinze Jr.
5791930	5796251	you know playing Vega with his you know not very good you know
5797771	5798172	Spanish.
5799573	5800174	That's loco.
5804680	5810547	But it should be, the actual DVD and Blu-ray will be out on December 28th in the US.
5810948	5814772	Although there is not a date for the UK yet.
5816388	5817789	Yeah, you can find the footage out.
5817909	5825312	And then there is a Halloween bundle from Indie Royale.
5826493	5829875	It has Sam and Max, The Devil's Playhouse, the full season.
5831015	5832076	It has Home.
5832936	5837999	It has Pathologic, MacGuffin's Curse, and Evil Quest.
5839559	5840140	And if you...
5842105	5850292	Pay over $8, you also receive a FLAC or MP3 copy of C. Jeff's chiptune album, Preshtale.
5851913	5852414	So there it goes.
5853394	5858238	You know, I was hoping that McGuffin's Curse, I kind of read that as McGruff's Curse.
5858539	5859780	Take a bite out of crime!
5860941	5865244	It's a noir, a film noir game starring McGruff, a crime dog.
5865524	5867986	Whatever happened to McGruff, the crime dog?
5868927	5871009	I think he got replaced with something more hip and young.
5873789	5874330	You know what I think?
5874350	5875610	I think you forgot to lock your door.
5875630	5876351	A lot of people do that.
5876371	5876871	They forget.
5877872	5881515	That's too bad because all crime needs is a chance.
5881555	5882255	Don't give it the chance.
5901056	5903460	It's my job to teach you to protect yourselves.
5903880	5905082	Make it your job to learn.
5905583	5908828	Write to Box 6600 Rockville, Maryland.
5909228	5910270	Oh, and one more thing.
5910931	5913755	Lock your door and take a bite out of crime.
5917020	5919863	I don't understand, like, that was a commercial on TV.
5920183	5921344	Lock your damn door.
5921564	5924888	Well, you know, when I was a little kid, we actually didn't lock our doors that much.
5924908	5925608	I guess that's true.
5925768	5926449	I guess that's true.
5926629	5932735	Growing up, you know, and it was different times, and especially if you lived somewhere a little more rural, there's still a lot of places like that.
5932755	5933716	I didn't live somewhere rural.
5933756	5934657	I lived in the suburbs.
5934697	5936799	But there's a lot of places still like that.
5936859	5937119	Yeah.
5937139	5938581	That they don't lock their doors at night.
5938961	5941043	And, you know, McGruff would like you to take a bite out of crime.
5943501	5944343	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5952912	5956154	They had a McGruff the Crime Dog monster truck.
5957915	5962118	Ranma in chat says, I remember when McGruff the Crime Dog came to my elementary school.
5962458	5964500	Did he take a bite out of the principal?
5966181	5970163	Stan says he was fired when they found a dead prostitute in McGruff's car.
5970684	5972205	Oh, well, that answers everything.
5972265	5972605	Thank you.
5972665	5974026	It's always the dead prostitutes.
5974046	5975427	They find themselves everywhere.
5975507	5976948	God, they ruin everything.
5977148	5978449	Damn those dead prostitutes.
5978909	5981551	All right, let's take a bite out of the Fugle Question of the Week.
5989460	5990060	Thanks for watching!
6009389	6013593	Tell us a story about a time when game over came too soon.
6014114	6020020	In other words, have you ever had an experience where you were really into playing a video game and then suddenly the power went out?
6020540	6021321	The internet went out.
6021741	6024144	A parent came in and turned off the system while you were playing.
6024504	6025485	How did you react?
6026927	6028348	All right, well, I'll get to the host in a minute.
6028408	6029790	Yeah, something just popped into my head.
6029870	6030730	Let's start with Actdeft.
6031644	6032325	Thanks for watching!
6052787	6054209	That's what you get for talking all that smack.
6055950	6056530	All right.
6058012	6058752	Let's see.
6058812	6060253	Panaxium answers the question.
6060293	6063196	It says, for me, it was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
6063736	6067579	I was trying to beat that obnoxious final boss for over an hour.
6068040	6075485	When I was finally about to beat the damn thing, my dad gracefully trips over the GameCube cables, yanking the power out of it.
6075886	6079308	I remember doing a Vader style, no!
6079328	6079368	No!
6080129	6087111	He looked at the blank screen a few seconds, then turned to me with a big dorky grin and said, Sorry, I'm prone to power trips.
6089512	6090492	That was horrible.
6093593	6095293	That was some punishment for the show.
6099294	6100855	Thank you so much for that, Dad.
6105296	6107157	I'm prone to power trips.
6110689	6111109	Let's see.
6112791	6115633	Going to Facebook to get some of the questions here.
6116173	6116513	Let's see.
6117454	6126661	Brandon H answered the question and said, Just unlocked everything in Guitar Hero 3, then in the middle of saving the power went out, and then it came back on.
6127081	6129083	Red ring of death and corrupted saves.
6130624	6136809	That was a really bad day, to have your machine red ring of death on top of the power failure and corrupt your saves.
6137609	6138170	That sucks.
6140059	6140640	Uh, let's see.
6141260	6144342	Uh, Joe G answers on Facebook and says, Oh, excuse me.
6144802	6145523	I used the wrong name.
6145543	6147324	So you have to put it at the beginning or I might miss it.
6147404	6150786	Haseo Sumerogawa says, I was playing Borderlands.
6150926	6160692	I was on Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot and I was playing the last arena there and was about three quarters of the way through and I had finished all other quests from the games and Zombie Island is rolling.
6161092	6164775	I died, got booted out, and I played the whole thing offline, mind you.
6164855	6166656	So when I died, I was shit out of luck
6167136	6177043	and what the fuck did the autosave and power flipped off corrupting the save data and I think people in Texas heard me yelling obscenities.
6178904	6186546	Burr replies, Growing up, I always remember getting kicked off the computer mid-game because my mom wanted me to take a break and go outside.
6186986	6194108	I always end up spending my time away from the game thinking about what was going to happen next, and it would continue on to the next day during school.
6194409	6198650	You can physically separate a gamer from their drug, but you can't keep it out of their mind.
6200110	6205713	James S replied and said, when I was about six years old, I was playing Yoshi's Cookie on the original Game Boy.
6206213	6207954	That game was awesome, just saying.
6208314	6209955	I love that game on the SNES.
6210955	6212736	Earmark that for a classic game some weeks.
6212776	6213556	I love Yoshi's Cookie.
6214377	6223061	Out of frustration on a high level, I proceeded to rage and I slammed the Game Boy against my head, causing the screen to shatter instantly.
6224332	6225773	Keep in mind, I was six.
6226413	6230076	I've never been so mortified yet satisfied in my entire life.
6231377	6231637	Ouch.
6232518	6237441	Have you ever, like, has your rage ever broken something that was like several hundred dollars like that?
6237581	6241143	Dan, back in the day, would break controllers.
6241684	6243505	And one time he took a controller back.
6244366	6250129	He bought a new controller and then returned the controller, except he returned the broken controller.
6251090	6272321	I think it was like a Saturn controller wow Ronnie B answered and said when I first moved to where I am now the breakers would trip every day often erasing hours of my Civ progress on the 360 I also hate when broken games often downloadable games glitch so badly the only option is to restart due to locked menus stuck cameras or whatever
6273809	6275770	SSJ100 Matt with an arcade answer.
6275790	6276210	I like this.
6276971	6284615	Back when I used to play a lot of Initial D in the arcade during my college years, I once lost my entire record and stats for my main car in the game.
6285175	6293720	I was in the process of transferring my data from Initial D2 to Initial D3 and the machine errored out and my card got jammed inside the machine.
6294120	6299063	Since my Initial D2 card was already voided because of the transfer, I lost everything.
6299583	6318793	several months worth of work on my main car was gone forever needless to say I was frustrated but after it happened I quit playing Initial D all the work that went into building that one car and then losing it got rid of my inspiration and drive pun intended to play the game anymore then
6320987	6322488	Let's see, I'm going to do one more answer here.
6323129	6323790	Hitstun says,
6338447	6338928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6358248	6359068	There's some good answers.
6359088	6360108	And I didn't read everything.
6360148	6360929	I apologize.
6360989	6367310	But go check out the rest of the answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus community.
6368590	6371811	Let's go around the room and see if anybody has things to share.
6371871	6373292	DarkSakura, I know you said you had something.
6373512	6379033	When I was in high school, my little brother Matthew got hit by a car.
6379953	6380993	He was six.
6382134	6387175	And that night, basically, I got dropped off at the mall with my best friend Jennifer.
6389296	6414112	and we went to the movies, went to the arcade because basically there's like here's some money and I ended up getting in on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game in the arcade and we, this is the first time I'd ever played a full four player game they had me on Leonardo so I was like okay he's kind of cool and we got all the way to the end of the game had just got the last hit and they shut off the machines
6415800	6419366	We were all like, no!
6419947	6420668	It was pretty bad.
6422443	6423604	Loki, can you think of a story?
6423864	6424865	I have one while you're thinking.
6426426	6429968	I don't have a lot of good ones, but do you know how old NES is?
6430448	6436332	You had to blow on the cartridge to get it to work, and then sometimes the game would just spontaneously reset, like right in the middle.
6436793	6440655	Yeah, that happened to us the night my friend and I decided to play Super Mario Bros.
6441015	6444618	3 from start to finish with no warping, around like World 6 or 7.
6445538	6452323	If something hit the ground too hard, which I think is what happened, I think we dropped something on the ground, and it just threw everything off balance enough so it was like, reset!
6453964	6455164	No.
6456805	6458225	Everything was ruined.
6458465	6460046	And we gave up and moved on.
6460326	6460566	Loki?
6460906	6464847	I don't really have anything that I remember as far as power outages and stuff like that.
6465148	6468449	The only thing I can remember is that I was making a pretty awesome...
6469289	6470230	Thank you for watching!
6486618	6493240	Can we take a moment to remind our listeners of the mutual love we have for the game ZZT?
6493900	6495361	I wish there was something like that again.
6495581	6496521	There's still Megazooks.
6496681	6497701	It's still out there.
6497721	6499222	Do they still make stuff for ZZT?
6499722	6500282	Megazooks.
6500982	6501702	Oh, right.
6501822	6502303	The new one.
6502783	6503483	That's amazing.
6504795	6505735	Anyway, sorry, DarkSakura.
6505755	6507036	It's just, you know, he said the magic word.
6507136	6508977	Yeah.
6509097	6514759	I one time spent four hours working on a sim house and forgot to save, and then the power went out.
6515880	6518120	We should have a VOGZZT contest.
6518661	6519461	I've thought about it.
6519661	6520501	I seriously have.
6520762	6522222	You and I would be the only ones that would enter.
6522442	6523303	Yeah, unfortunately.
6524591	6525052	You know what?
6525553	6526314	Prove me wrong.
6526755	6531602	If there's interest in a ZZT VOG contest, email the show and tell us you're interested.
6531642	6532504	You'd participate.
6532884	6534727	And we will put something together.
6535729	6536089	Alright.
6537543	6540466	All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to listless tonight.
6540486	6541427	But first, Loki.
6541928	6544310	So the PS3's been hacked again, sort of.
6545211	6552139	Basically what happened was a hacker group called the Three Musketeers finally released the level zero keys.
6552719	6556483	And not necessarily the way to get those keys themselves, but...
6557364	6557884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6581651	6589880	So, I think that's why it has to run on the 355 firmware, because anything newer doesn't use those keys anymore.
6590340	6597168	But, you know, for compatibility's sake, they need to have everything, you know, use those keys at some point.
6597328	6598008	I don't know.
6598769	6602994	Honestly, it's been so long since I've looked into the hacking stuff, it's... I don't know.
6603334	6617524	But, apparently, this is supposed to be unpatchable as far as they can keep using this exploit to forever have custom firmwares on PS3 and run new games and stuff like that.
6618505	6620186	So, that's kind of interesting.
6621687	6624349	But we'll have to see if that's actually going to happen.
6624449	6627811	But as of right now, they haven't really released any new...
6630225	6632931	Although, I have to double check that.
6633632	6640005	I want to say I saw something about a custom firmware for 4.3 come out.
6640446	6641208	Let me see here.
6644404	6647405	Debug firmware for 4.25 has been leaked.
6654289	6655089	Let's see here.
6656050	6656730	What's this?
6658611	6659732	Homebrew for custom firmware 4.21.
6659772	6660052	Updated DMCA.
6660072	6660132	Hmm.
6672960	6674162	So what does this really mean?
6674222	6676708	Is this going to be like rampant piracy on the PS3 now?
6676728	6677470	No more than it already is.
6677530	6680096	It just means that they're going to be able to keep doing it.
6681659	6682020	Gotcha.
6683314	6711666	alrighty I would say you have to have I think a firmware that's like 355 or lower which I don't remember what mine is right now because I haven't updated in a long time so I don't think I'm 355 I think I'm newer than that but you know if you have an older firmware then that means that you'll be able to translate the old ones so that they can run like a custom firmware on those or based off those
6712597	6719147	Well, you know the old saying we have on the show, hackers gonna hack, but at least no personal information stolen, right?
6719588	6720389	It's not that kind of hack?
6720819	6721519	Not that kind of hack.
6721919	6728001	Okay, because a lot of people were... I think there's some misinformation out there because people were saying, did it get hacked again?
6728061	6730401	Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation got hacked again?
6731321	6733282	So it's not that kind of hack, right?
6733862	6734082	Yeah.
6734762	6735062	All right.
6735842	6739403	Well, I'm going to get into another story here on a completely different note.
6739483	6748805	This is something that has me very excited, and I want to see if this is something maybe a few of you out there can recognize by the music, which I love the soundtrack to this game.
6752014	6752816	Anyone recognize this?
6753819	6758049	Actually, if you played this game as much as I did, you probably heard this song a lot more.
6762099	6765642	Shadowgate, Shadowgate, Shadowgate, Shadowgate, Shadowgate
6788519	6793022	Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that.
6793322	6799225	Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, they worked on the original Shadowgate with ICOM simulations 25 years ago.
6799706	6801507	They've started this new company.
6801827	6806870	They bought the rights to the old Shadowgate game, and Uninvited, and Deja Vu, apparently.
6808031	6828767	and also got the rights to the 8-bit soundtrack which apparently was done by somebody completely different it was done by a Japanese guy who I guess maybe in the port of the games over to the NES maybe it was done there so like if you listen to the trailer for Shadowgate it has like a newer version of that music which is awesome let me see if I can play a little bit of this for you but yeah um
6829588	6830789	They're doing a Kickstarter for this.
6831190	6835694	It's going to be redesigned puzzles and an expanded storyline.
6835734	6839117	But most of the plot devices from the original game will still be there.
6839497	6843020	And like in the trailer, you can definitely see the room with the lake.
6843341	6845042	Like you used to put the orb in the lake to freeze it.
6845322	6848685	And you can see the room with the dragon breathing fire at the other end.
6848765	6850967	So there's all of that in there.
6851088	6853510	So very, very cool that they're doing this.
6853550	6854170	They are seeking $120,000.
6856112	6861133	to do versions for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.
6861533	6869515	You can do $10 right now to get a DRM-free, and they're really emphasizing that, a DRM-free download when the game comes out.
6869555	6879757	They are projecting 2013 November for that, so it is gonna be a bit of a wait, but I will say this, this is only the second Kickstarter ever that I've given money to.
6879957	6881497	I did donate to this Kickstarter because...
6882157	6883318	I really like Shadowgate.
6884059	6888522	I liked those old ICOM games, so I'm really excited about this.
6889002	6890884	I will say this, though.
6891784	6893205	I only have so much money.
6893346	6897649	I couldn't do the $130 or more, but that did sound really cool.
6897709	6899850	An original Shadowgate card game.
6900831	6901852	That would have been kind of cool.
6901992	6904533	But a little bit out of my price range, personally.
6904573	6908555	But I'm sure there's people already... It's already up to $41,000.
6909575	6909955	Sound again.
6909975	6910796	Let me fast forward.
6910816	6912156	I want to do this part of the trailer here.
6921914	6948031	so you can tell they're like totally like which is pretty awesome there's the wraith i remember that from one scene so you definitely see the artwork is gorgeous oh yeah i would pay for this just for the artwork yeah it's it's it's gorgeous so um yeah zojoy is the name of the company that is putting this together that uh these guys started so good luck to them and obviously as a fan of these games since i was a kid i hope they do it i really want it so very cool
6949728	6950729	Let's move on with some more news.
6950869	6953150	One more story and then we're going to get to Listless tonight.
6953230	6953750	DarkSakura.
6955271	6956512	Oh, I do have another story, don't I?
6956712	6957272	Yes, ma'am.
6957952	6961414	Well, how about the game Waking Mars?
6962275	6966337	This one was an iOS ecological puzzle adventure game.
6966937	6971899	It's actually going to be coming out to PC, Mac, Linux, and Android on November 6th.
6973240	6976922	It's a revamped version done by Tiger Style Games.
6977703	6985768	And this is going to have high def with voice acting throughout the game and be just a great big step up from the iOS version.
6985808	6996414	But I mean, this was really interesting to me is that they specifically listed Linux among the platforms, which I think is great Linux getting more attention.
6997815	7002898	And of course, a lot of people kind of giving Mars attention with the whole curiosity and all that, right?
7004002	7004924	Well, there is that too.
7006386	7012538	But I... This is a game that I kind of had my eye on to play for a little while and I just never went back for it.
7012658	7012718	It...
7014875	7015755	Excuse me, so sorry.
7017056	7022397	But it's a game that was supposed to have really shown off just how great iOS can be programmed.
7023337	7026378	And I think I'm definitely going to play this on PC.
7027138	7027659	Sounds good.
7028459	7029299	You have to tell me how it is.
7029839	7031360	I'm waiting for your review before I check it out.
7031460	7032220	Okay.
7032320	7032580	All right.
7033440	7034801	Let's get to that time, folks.
7034861	7036561	It is time to bring this segment back.
7036601	7037761	It's been forever since we've done it.
7037801	7039962	It is time to play Listless.
7043683	7050405	If you've never heard Listless before, what we're going to do tonight is we are going to create the definitive list, the definitive answer.
7050425	7054726	This is a highly scientific process, the definitive list around a topic.
7055167	7057027	Here's how it'll work, and I'll tell you the topic in a minute.
7057047	7058668	There's going to be four of us playing tonight.
7059628	7066550	We're going to have a special guest join us here, so everybody help me welcome to the show or welcome back to the show, Alan.
7066910	7067450	Hey.
7067770	7068451	How you doing, Alan?
7068771	7069031	Good.
7069471	7072053	All right, so Alan is going to be playing listless with us tonight.
7073094	7075716	The four of us will give our top three answers.
7076196	7077417	That's going to leave us a list of 12.
7078257	7081620	Then we're going to go around the room and each eliminate one answer.
7081680	7084802	It's a really tough thing we got to do, but it's part of the process.
7085142	7086924	That's going to leave us with a list of eight.
7087384	7097291	And then those of you in the chat room will vote on those final eight answers and help us come up with our definitive list of the top three answers to this topic.
7097431	7097891	Here it is.
7098972	7107678	Earlier in the show, we talked about that G4 is losing its last bit of video game programming and that it will no longer be a video game network.
7108058	7111060	And most of us have thrown up our hands and said, I'm done.
7111380	7111740	I'm out.
7112140	7112421	Later.
7112721	7113641	Nice knowing you, G4.
7114282	7115623	So tonight's listless topic...
7116443	7120384	The TV show that would make me watch G4 again.
7121164	7122425	It could be an existing show.
7122945	7124145	It could be a new show.
7124705	7126186	It could be anything you want.
7126526	7129527	The show that would make me watch G4 again.
7129887	7140250	If you want to give your suggestions in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com in case an answer should get duplicated or, you know, sometimes we just like the chat answers better than our own.
7140630	7145471	Make your suggestions in the chat room and we will read some of our favorite answers from chat.
7145771	7149714	So again, TV show that would make me watch G4 again.
7150795	7154017	All right, let's go around and start building the list.
7154237	7156599	So we will start with Loki tonight.
7157902	7163407	Loki, what is your number three answer for a show that would make you watch Chief Oregon?
7164028	7169433	The brand new Iron Chef series that they're doing, the Japanese Iron Chef, but translated in English.
7172016	7172536	All right.
7172576	7176159	Now, to be fair, the Food Network probably has a lock on this show.
7176260	7177120	Not yet.
7178141	7178762	Oh, not yet.
7178822	7180704	Well, I mean, it hasn't started yet, so...
7181204	7184226	Alright, that's a pretty serious answer.
7184306	7185367	I want new Japanese Iron Chef.
7185447	7187048	Alright, new Japanese Iron Chef.
7187068	7187588	There you go.
7188789	7190970	Let's go to DarkSakura.
7191250	7192311	Your number three answer.
7192391	7193852	Show that we get you to watch G4 again.
7194312	7198435	Well, first of all, I never actually watched it, but I would go for Real Housewives Disney Edition.
7199475	7200156	Like on SNL.
7203660	7229335	So like an actual version of that sketch from SNL The Real Housewives of Disney Yeah, that's a good suggestion, I like that Alright, my number three answer tonight And I see people saying this in chat right now So chat and I are on the same page My number three answer is Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo Yes Where the contestants who don't do well at the games Will actually get electrified Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo
7232354	7236659	I was going to say Nick Arcade, but that wouldn't make sense because it's Nick Arcade.
7240844	7246330	All right, so so far we have New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, and Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.
7246871	7252237	Alan, what would be the number three answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again?
7254853	7256134	A documentary special.
7256334	7259817	We're responsible for Olivia Munn, and we're very, very sorry.
7260237	7262058	A five-hour apology special.
7265761	7266182	Good answer.
7266202	7272146	I'm going to shorten that a little bit to Olivia Munn apology special.
7272446	7275889	Now, that would only be one movie, unfortunately, or a miniseries.
7276189	7277310	It could be like a miniseries.
7277590	7281933	And what things about Olivia Munn should be apologized for?
7282854	7283655	Have you seen her face?
7285522	7287102	Wow, that's cold.
7287703	7288623	You are cold.
7289503	7289863	All right.
7289943	7297965	So, so far, we have New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, and Olivia Munn Apology Special.
7300046	7302186	Deanna Allers, look at her and go, girl.
7302326	7304187	You need to check yourself.
7304387	7308568	All right.
7309088	7312129	Loki, what is your number two pick for the list?
7312549	7313329	The screensavers.
7316691	7322292	DarkSakura, your number two answer My number two answer is Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling
7352628	7353911	because GLOW was awesome.
7354512	7357418	You want gorgeous ladies of wrestling.
7357939	7359884	I was addicted to GLOW when I was a kid.
7360084	7361126	It was a good show.
7361206	7362329	Oh, this was an old show?
7362349	7362710	I didn't...
7363311	7370474	Back in the day, I had Godiva, the woman who wore the skin-colored bodysuit with flowers all over it, and Mount Fuji.
7371575	7372295	Hated it.
7373996	7374336	All right.
7374536	7375477	GLOW is awesome.
7376277	7378178	My mom used to let me stay up until 1 a.m.
7378218	7380159	and watch UHF and see the GLOW show.
7380699	7382340	So I might have to vote for that.
7383200	7384281	Don't you mean USA?
7384361	7386582	Wasn't UHF like the Weird Al movie?
7388119	7411196	A weird movie based off of the alternative band of TV radio that had channels on it, yeah Alright, alright My number two answer tonight for a show that would make me watch G4 again The Days of Our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera There you go, Days of Our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera You mean The Shitadel
7417518	7421842	I can't believe, DarkSakura, I do not have your support on a Mass Effect soap opera.
7422783	7423424	What is up with that?
7423544	7424245	I would watch it.
7424465	7424865	There you go.
7424926	7425166	See?
7425766	7426427	You would watch it.
7426447	7427428	Extra garris.
7427648	7427969	All right.
7428809	7434555	If Nickelodeon could have 15 as a soap opera, we can have Days of Our Citadel.
7435056	7435416	All right.
7436577	7439040	Alan, your number two answer for the list.
7441020	7447614	How not to market something special 35 year old nerds They're loaded, they're loyal, they're distracted
7449198	7452480	Wait, you need to explain this one a little bit while I figure out how to shorten the answer.
7452500	7453401	What would this show be?
7453841	7461847	The whole basis of the G4 channel model is let's appeal to adult geeks because they have money, they play video games.
7462367	7465909	We're going to put shows on TV that they'll want to watch.
7466210	7471013	They still buy lots of video games each year and they're not watching this yet.
7471813	7472514	We're confused.
7474435	7476958	I shortened that to 35-year-old nerd special.
7476998	7477599	Does that work?
7478159	7479961	By the way, you and I turn 35 next year.
7480001	7480722	I just want to point that out.
7480742	7482785	You know something sad?
7482885	7483085	What?
7483165	7484747	My brother Phillip yesterday turned 30.
7484807	7486649	On the 26th, sorry, the other day.
7489312	7503758	Alright, so so far we have on the list New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of Our Citadel, Mass Effect Soap Opera, and 35-Year-Old Nerd Special.
7503878	7504479	It is time.
7504559	7506359	The number one answers.
7506399	7510181	The number one thing that would most make you watch G4.
7510581	7510921	Loki.
7511582	7518685	Well, I mean, if they're going to compete with Spike, then really there's only one choice, and that is big-breasted bikini car wash.
7523639	7527320	And how exactly would big-breasted bikini car wash be a show?
7528041	7534383	It's just women washing cars and sudsing up each other with large breasts.
7536783	7540865	And would Loki get to be a special correspondent that motorboats the boobies?
7541205	7541865	I'll be the host.
7541905	7543105	I'll be doing the play-by-play.
7546066	7547627	Nelly will get to motorboat the boobies.
7550090	7563881	I would love... Or you can just have me, like, you know, in the beginning of each episode, I'll drive up the car, honk the horn, cast a smile at the camera, and... I would love you and your wife to host this show, because your wife would just walk up to the ladies and be like, how did you let your boobies get so big?
7566943	7568464	You have really big areolas.
7570786	7572507	Alright, DarkSakura.
7572527	7575508	No, no, no, that's just shameful.
7575668	7576989	I mean, they're not going to be topless.
7577489	7581150	I mean, that could be the whole web series, but you know.
7582091	7583671	The unrated Blu-ray.
7583771	7586432	I'm fine with topless car wash too, but you know.
7586913	7587693	Alright, Big Breast.
7587713	7590754	I guess it doesn't say, well, they could start off with bikinis.
7591494	7591775	Alright.
7591855	7594195	Really, but then we're getting the Playboy content there.
7594216	7595836	We don't want to infringe on any of their rights.
7595916	7598517	I'm surprised you didn't do World Series of Strip Poker.
7598597	7599738	That's where I thought you'd be going.
7599858	7600118	Alright.
7600638	7605367	DarkSakura I would actually watch the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show if they did one.
7614710	7617512	because I love watching the Angry Video Game Nerd.
7618493	7620175	I love watching his movie specials.
7620415	7623137	You think it's time for the Angry Video Game Nerd crossover?
7623437	7623978	I think it's time.
7623998	7625619	From YouTubes to cable.
7625639	7630343	I almost said ScrewAttack, but I think the Angry Video Game Nerd would be more marketable.
7630680	7631580	Okay, there you go.
7632921	7638003	Let's see, my number one answer, and this is big, you guys.
7638864	7643906	Every single one of you know that if this show was on G4, you'd be click, I am there.
7644626	7648948	My number one answer is Loki's cosplay challenge.
7652310	7653811	I don't understand what that is.
7655551	7656472	Who am I challenging?
7656940	7661962	It would basically go around to different anime conventions and interview people that are cosplay.
7662442	7665583	And then the viewers would pick their favorite cosplay.
7666023	7668805	And then the challenge would be that you have to imitate it.
7669345	7670005	Yeah.
7670985	7672006	I don't think I'd watch that.
7674027	7674367	I would.
7674387	7674927	All right.
7674987	7676567	Loki's cosplay challenge.
7677088	7677428	All right.
7678688	7685371	Lastly, but not leastly, certainly not leastly, Alan, your number one answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again.
7687004	7695788	I'm going to preface this response by saying that I used to watch Tech TV back in the very beginning when Adam Sessler, the host, extended play out in front of the Metreon.
7696948	7697748	He's very cute.
7697969	7698489	I'm sorry.
7699709	7709873	My number one answer is Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira present Black Boxer Brief Boner Boxing, a Gaynor Telethon to please, please come out of the closet.
7717156	7720260	I just shortened it to Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.
7722342	7723223	It works, right?
7724624	7727127	Alright, even though there was something about boxer briefs.
7727147	7727448	I don't know.
7727848	7731052	Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing works for me.
7731512	7731873	Alright.
7732333	7735814	So here it is, the list as it stands right now, the 12 on the list.
7736475	7759963	New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of Our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap, 35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash, Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge, and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.
7760883	7765565	So, unfortunately, it is time to go around and take items off the list.
7765965	7766946	It's part of the process.
7767046	7769747	It's painful, but science is painful.
7770427	7771948	Do it for science.
7772508	7774749	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7774769	7775990	I have a lot of them, actually.
7778133	7778974	Sorry, Alan.
7780355	7784939	Let's do the... Let's get rid of the Olivia Munn apology special.
7785960	7787561	It's a one-time special.
7787601	7789002	She is on the Daily Show.
7789062	7790784	She is fucking awful.
7791044	7795247	They are responsible for her and they need to pay reparations.
7795728	7796749	They need to pay.
7799651	7800171	All right.
7800832	7801933	That's part of the game.
7803197	7805360	And that's why Jon Stewart is the best person on television.
7821388	7826251	Alright, the Olivia Munn apology special is gone, which makes sense.
7826271	7827551	There's nothing left to apologize for.
7828152	7830713	Alright, DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7831133	7832494	Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash.
7834155	7835375	Because, because...
7836776	7838037	It's so cliche.
7838198	7841280	I mean, why don't you have big-breasted monster truck driving or something?
7841460	7841861	Hey!
7842842	7844223	We can have a network based on this.
7844403	7845944	Big-breasted entertainment.
7846585	7847386	The BBB.
7849427	7851469	Alright, my turn to eliminate something.
7852470	7854752	I am going to eliminate... Oh, this is hard.
7855473	7862038	I really hate to do this, but DarkSakura, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling, has got to go.
7862879	7863479	I'm sorry.
7863639	7864720	You never watched it.
7864800	7866221	I'm not a wrestling person.
7866261	7866781	There's plenty.
7866901	7867902	It wasn't just that.
7868022	7868322	It was.
7868622	7871164	You have UPN for your wrestling needs or whatever.
7871204	7872004	CW or whatever.
7872024	7873325	But there's no more glow.
7873585	7873905	All right.
7873965	7874666	I'm sorry.
7874866	7875506	I'm sorry.
7875946	7876627	Will you forgive me?
7877367	7878868	Will you forgive me if Pinkberry is involved?
7879128	7879328	Yes.
7879528	7879808	All right.
7881629	7884231	Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7887188	7894897	Last time I did a list list, I would say that I would be the chat room's voice, because I'm infamous for getting rid of the things that they most want to win, like President Cat.
7895358	7900884	So I'm trying to look at what they don't want to get rid of.
7901164	7907552	I'm going to say New Japanese Iron Chef, because I don't see that mentioned at all.
7908727	7912489	Alright, new Japanese Iron Chef, it is stricken from the list.
7912990	7918193	Alright, so there it is, you are left with... How did 35 year old Nerd Special survive?
7918293	7919974	I don't even understand that one still.
7919994	7921275	Can you explain that one more time?
7921935	7923256	We live it, don't resent it.
7927565	7929867	Rob, don't dream it.
7930307	7930828	Be it.
7932169	7933029	All right, let's see.
7934790	7936231	Some of the comments from the chat room.
7936311	7940374	Some of the answers from our chat room that did not make the cut.
7941215	7947179	Shane kind of was on to something because Shane suggested hot guys playing games in underwear.
7947579	7949841	And you sort of did do that one, right?
7950041	7951442	There you go.
7951502	7951862	Let's see.
7951963	7956206	TigerClaw says, when G4 gets syndicated episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.
7956226	7956766	Exactly.
7957266	7981421	Stan says The Late Show with GLaDOS Taiki says Clippy B's Drag Race Virtual Phil says RuPaul's PVP Bloodbath A lot of folks, Duke Nukem saying Arena, Portal, Icons, and the shows that actually were on G4 some time ago
7982521	7984442	So here it is one more time in chatters.
7984502	7985643	It is time for you to vote.
7985743	7990345	Send Rob Roberts a private message with your number one and number two pick.
7990385	7990805	Here it is.
7991385	8008593	Real Housewives of Disney, Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo, The Screensavers, Days of Our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap Opera, 35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge, and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.
8009113	8009693	There it is.
8009933	8011975	Shouldn't it be Black Boxer Boner Boxing?
8012895	8015937	I think Black Boner Boxing, but Black Boner Boxing sounds better.
8015957	8017998	It goes back to our reoccurring theme of Big Black Cock.
8018158	8023701	But remember, it's really guys in black boxer briefs wrestling with boners.
8023761	8024241	What was it?
8026182	8030204	Adam Sessler and Kevin Ferrer's Black Boxer Brief Boner Bonanza.
8032185	8033286	Alliteration special.
8034019	8036121	Alright, send in your votes.
8036261	8037942	Please vote now.
8038042	8041905	Send a private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two pick.
8042966	8047569	Alright, and while we do that, it is time to go to the mailbag.
8048070	8049891	Are you going to read these tonight, DarkSakura, or do I need to?
8050211	8050812	Please do.
8051072	8052153	My voice is actually going.
8054054	8062681	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some of our favorites to read here on air, except I haven't pulled up the mailbag yet.
8063969	8065730	I do have it up, so I'll just go ahead and do it.
8066691	8067131	Wait, I'm there.
8067331	8067611	I'm there.
8067631	8070372	Do you want to do... Okay, never mind.
8070473	8070773	I'm in it.
8072193	8072534	Let's see.
8072594	8073614	Where are we going to start tonight?
8074054	8075435	Were you going to read all four?
8075455	8076256	Yeah.
8076516	8077936	Okay, I didn't know if you'd screen them or not.
8079237	8080398	Professional radio, boys and girls.
8081638	8082659	Let's start with AZHP.
8083259	8084000	Hey, OLR crew.
8084320	8086261	I decided to check out a new anime called...
8087913	8088233	Aoi?
8088253	8089475	I don't know how to say that word.
8089595	8089875	Aoi?
8090596	8090916	Aoi.
8091236	8091316	Aoi.
8091436	8092077	It means blue.
8092437	8094900	Aoi Sekai no Chusen Dei.
8095480	8101385	It's touted as being a parody of the old console wars between Nintendo and Sega with gratuitous fan service.
8101986	8103748	And as far as I'm concerned, it delivers.
8104368	8110614	It tells the story of the small country of Seigua fighting against Ninteldo for control of their continent.
8111094	8122421	It's only on its first episode as of this writing, but so far they've introduced a number of somewhat easily recognizable, at least by DarkSakura, not sure how massively knowledgeable on classic Sega games Rob and Loki are, parody characters.
8122901	8128925	A blue-haired protagonist named Gear, who is super speedy and is trying to avenge the death of his beloved friend Teal.
8129585	8134068	Okay, I know Sonic and Tails, come on, cut me some slack here, cut me some slack here.
8134728	8139731	A purple-haired sister, Nell, who is his emotional support, like Nii from Phantasy Star 2.
8140292	8146476	The General Hermes, he has colored gems on her necklace, maybe a parody of columns.
8147016	8151439	The rival lieutenant with little angel wings in her hair, Opal, based on Opa Opa.
8151459	8152080	Opa Opa!
8152140	8152620	Opa Opa!
8153240	8154001	I love Opa Opa.
8154201	8160065	And a genius tactician, Tetraloff, who loves sticking a long stick into things to fill holes.
8160525	8162467	I'll give you three guesses on what that's from.
8163187	8163767	Pornography?
8166452	8168036	A picture for the host's benefit.
8169359	8170702	A little picture there of all the characters.
8170722	8172506	Okay, I need to see this.
8172707	8173348	I'm getting this.
8173388	8174411	I like the little monkey.
8176553	8180976	Oh, it's super dumb and has girls clothes coming off for pretty much no reason.
8181936	8182737	That's all you need, right?
8182757	8184057	That's classic TV right there.
8184238	8191301	And the main villain has a giant mustache, a sword with a mushroom shaped grip, and he rides a flying dragon.
8191422	8193443	Seriously, look at how dumb he looks.
8194723	8196424	Oh, it says no hot linking.
8197725	8198485	What did you do?
8199686	8199966	Hold on.
8199986	8203068	I got to copy paste this link because it doesn't like me linking it.
8205101	8207906	Ah, this is great radio when I copy-paste.
8208867	8212152	Not gonna let you, because it's... So is it Alisekaino what?
8212193	8213214	It's access it from the website.
8213234	8214116	Blue World of what?
8214236	8214596	Sorry.
8215598	8216760	Uh, I don't know.
8217201	8219064	Alisekaino Chushinde.
8221310	8223792	Well, I know the first part's Blue World of something.
8224512	8230357	In conclusion, I highly recommend this anime because it's super dumb and pandering to people who like classic games and big boobs.
8230717	8232579	So I figure it would be perfect for OLR.
8233159	8233620	Correct!
8234060	8234300	It is!
8234320	8234961	That would be correct.
8235782	8237063	I've seen manga for this, I think.
8237083	8237203	Yeah?
8265964	8268806	The design looks way familiar.
8270127	8278493	It's too bad we didn't hear about that before we were talking about the G4 shows we'd like to see.
8278613	8280775	Going to our next email, which is from Nutman.
8281715	8284357	I just wanted to give my condolences to Jamie after losing her cat.
8284737	8288120	My dog I had for 13 years just passed away recently and it was awful.
8288640	8293764	We think she had a stroke at some point and she may have had many seizures before we could get her to the vet to be put to sleep.
8294364	8297788	It was terrible and I wish that they would not have been the last memories I have of her.
8298208	8305056	It sounds like Shermie, I butchered the name I'm sure, and they did spell it wrong, but that's okay, they tried, went peacefully during the night though.
8305456	8309501	I could never talk about it on air like you, so massive kudos to having the courage to do that.
8309581	8310502	I think I would tear up.
8310542	8311723	Jamie did a very good job last week.
8311874	8326777	Thank you, I did have a pretty significant sniffle Losing a pet, and that was not the sinus infection either Losing a pet is something that only other pet owners can understand I hope you will feel better about this terrible situation soon, happy face
8327591	8330072	Well, it's been about a week and a half now.
8331013	8343700	And it's funny, like last night I was walking back to the bedroom to go to bed and I saw a shadow at my feet and my brain instantly went to it's Shermie and stepped over the shadow.
8343760	8346462	And I was like, wait, that's not the cat.
8346722	8348863	So yeah, it's getting slowly better.
8348983	8352846	But I still have problems doing laundry, actually, because that was Shermie's room.
8353966	8356468	Well, good excuse to make Dan do the laundry.
8356648	8356948	Yeah.
8357188	8357608	Seriously.
8358048	8358389	All right.
8358829	8360309	Redertainment starts this email.
8360429	8360869	Trainer.
8361730	8362770	Hello, Podcrafters.
8362790	8365851	Does he have a thing for, like, Trainer in the Mass Effect games or is this another reference?
8365931	8366571	I need to know this.
8367332	8368272	Redertainment wants to know.
8368332	8369352	Hello, Podcrafters.
8369553	8375455	After seeing Loki's Halloween costume on Twitter, which, by the way, Loki, amazing Halloween costume.
8375475	8377015	Have you worn it yet or is that for work?
8377655	8378196	It's for work.
8379176	8380637	This question comes to mind.
8380757	8384319	What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?
8384979	8387760	Mine is the Kigurumi I wore last year.
8388241	8390862	I might wear it again this year due to its supreme awesomeness.
8391322	8393563	Stay Care, Red Entertainment, Trainer.
8393864	8394664	Sent from my iPad.
8394864	8397685	For the record, that's basically the animal pajamas.
8399106	8399706	That's what those are.
8400847	8402548	What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?
8404039	8406783	My weirdest costumes have always been from my actual cosplay.
8412692	8415377	I don't really think I've done anything weird for Halloween.
8417070	8424014	I did go as a pirate wench, which was fun, because I walked around with a whip and just started smacking on my coworkers.
8424394	8425955	Well, and Halloween's about being slutty.
8426595	8427716	No, it wasn't slutty at all.
8428436	8436540	It was just, you know, the bodice, that was about as slutty as it got, but it was a long skirt and big boots and a whip and my hat.
8439902	8445005	I tried one time to wear, I was going to wear my bike in costume one year, but that would have just been cold.
8449713	8450974	All right, let's see.
8451074	8454215	Going to the next email from... Oh, I'm sorry.
8454275	8455195	I want to answer the question, too.
8455215	8456856	The weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween.
8457276	8462498	When I was in eighth grade, I dressed as a bag lady, and I got sent to the principal's office because I hit a kid with my purse.
8462898	8464619	But he had it coming.
8464659	8465559	He was an asshole.
8465619	8473322	He was one of those eighth grade bullies, and he dared to make a comment about my costume, and so I thwacked him with my purse, like a bag lady would do, right?
8475523	8476123	He deserved it.
8477984	8479928	What are you... Oh, you're sending one from... Oh, an email?
8482013	8482674	Oh, okay.
8483616	8488427	Except I'm like full up on messages right now, so look at that, because I've got to count the votes still.
8490416	8490716	Oh, okay.
8490976	8493518	Sorry, talking behind the scenes and no one could hear any of that anyway.
8493538	8494198	Geez.
8495119	8497260	All right, one more email from Flaco Jones.
8497501	8500322	He always emails Horde House, so I'm very happy to hear him crossing over here.
8500722	8501483	Flaco Jones.
8501523	8502083	Hey, OLR.
8502424	8512890	I haven't heard anyone else on the show bring it up and it's getting close to Halloween, so I thought I'd write in and give my review for Welcome to Silent Hill, The Haunted House, or Maze, as they call it, at Universal Studios.
8513590	8514551	I am glad to hear about this.
8514611	8517473	Someone mentioned that to me, by the way, having seen it.
8517613	8518213	Maybe Extover?
8518233	8519214	Because he saw it.
8519534	8521595	I don't think it was X4, I think it was somebody else, but yeah.
8541042	8541763	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8560416	8561357	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8584011	8586252	It was a great time and they did a fantastic job.
8586372	8589113	It better be there next year because we can't wait to go back.
8589493	8590974	Happy Halloween, Flaco Jones.
8591634	8593195	Well, bad news for Flaco Jones.
8593495	8596557	The movie came in sixth place at the box office this week.
8598037	8600098	Not looking good for any long-term memory.
8600138	8603279	But then again, if they invested all that money in it, who knows?
8603360	8605440	Maybe they will bring it back again next year.
8606221	8607421	That does it for emails tonight.
8607501	8613144	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us your emails for a future...
8615591	8617671	Meanwhile, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.
8633597	8635257	FU to my son, this infection.
8635957	8636798	I really hate it.
8637118	8638238	I hate my voice going.
8639078	8640319	And then my really...
8643022	8649807	I like having short hair, but it wasn't stacked quite right, so it's a little uneven in the back.
8651929	8653190	Yeah, I think that's it.
8653851	8655472	Oh, and Origin, EA.
8658334	8658654	Loki.
8659455	8660616	After you did my weekly headache.
8661741	8662641	Oh, you have a headache again?
8662982	8664022	Yep, I get them every Sunday.
8665303	8666563	It's... I don't know what it's from.
8667784	8668244	Sorry to hear it.
8668284	8669365	Maybe I stay up too late.
8669405	8670585	Maybe you're allergic to this show.
8670905	8676528	No, it's before I get to the show, so... It's not anything to do with the show, it's just... I get a headache.
8677228	8682691	Um, an F you to not having enough hours in the day, because, like, I'm really... Like, we have not had time to go to the grocery store today.
8682711	8684792	We've been doing so much, but... Eh.
8686473	8686953	That's alright.
8686973	8687913	I shouldn't complain about it.
8687933	8689314	Yeah, you were running around when I got here.
8690003	8690203	Yep.
8691444	8692645	I took a 15-minute nap.
8693425	8695146	And then I was like, where are Loki's stories?
8696527	8697327	But it all worked out.
8698228	8704812	In fact, Loki has another story for us before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8704872	8705332	Not just yet.
8705352	8707553	We'll let you know when here in a moment.
8707753	8709174	But meanwhile, Loki.
8709855	8713717	Yes, apparently the Urban Outfitters is selling unlicensed Nintendo product.
8713937	8714938	Oh my goodness!
8716059	8716640	What?
8717761	8720843	How dare they not license stuff to sell?
8720963	8722965	And all this, like, really random stuff.
8723005	8726288	I mean, considering Urban Outfitters is basically, like, apparel.
8727008	8730431	I mean, it's kind of not really something that I would see them selling.
8730852	8744243	But, like, they're trying to sell Nintendo 64 controllers, USB Nintendo, or Super Nintendo controllers, and, like, Supaboy portable game console and one of those knockoff Super Nintendo things.
8746215	8746515	I don't know.
8746535	8756045	I'm not really sure why this is news, but we're talking about... Well, because it's knockoff shit, and it's at a major store, you know?
8756185	8756505	I don't know.
8756545	8762371	So, everybody sells those stupid knockoff Super Nintendo Genesis things.
8762411	8764734	I mean, all the indie game stores sell them.
8766320	8767401	and Urban Outfitters.
8767421	8768541	That's just weird.
8768581	8773323	That just seems like Sears selling something like that.
8773964	8776325	Who gives a shit that they're selling that?
8778752	8782214	Well, I'm going to go run to Urban Outfitters right now after the show and check that out.
8782855	8783515	Just kidding.
8784116	8784636	I'm just kidding.
8786137	8787758	All right, I got a story for you guys here.
8787978	8792141	It's about a favorite game of mine getting an MMO, but there's a twist to it.
8792781	8793542	Isn't there always?
8793682	8795543	It's a Civilization MMO.
8795623	8797805	Yep, Civilization Online MMO.
8798405	8800627	It's going to be available soon in Asia.
8802499	8817615	FireAxis is working with XL Games a Korean studio that did the game Lineage you might have heard of that game it's like the biggest MMO in the world yes bigger than Warcraft they're going to create Civilization Online it is an online only game it's going to be in Asian markets soon
8818796	8820317	Yeah, they're doing Civilization Online.
8820357	8823559	They don't say a whole lot else about it, just otherwise the partnership there.
8823999	8827381	Not a lot of news about what is going to be in the game or anything like that.
8827441	8833204	But it's a little weird to me because Civ 5 you can already play online.
8833284	8834824	So how does an MMO work?
8834925	8836425	Does it like never stop?
8836866	8840768	Is it like an endless world that you can always explore?
8840868	8842488	There's more things about this I'd like to know.
8842508	8843269	And the other one is...
8843849	8845672	Why won't we get a version in the US?
8846873	8847694	Maybe E3?
8847754	8850197	They'll announce some type of partnership to publish it here locally?
8850257	8850818	I hope so.
8851138	8852820	Because I'd like to be able to try this, you know.
8856758	8861983	Alright, that's going to do it for the news tonight, which means it is time to open up the Skype line!
8862003	8866587	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8866687	8867288	Give us a call.
8867628	8872172	We'll talk about whatever you want to talk about in the news tonight or maybe something else.
8872813	8877797	In the meantime, we'll get to Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR or Loki.
8877837	8881641	I don't know if there's anything you want to add here for last minute stories while we wait for some calls.
8881761	8882282	Hey, how you doing?
8882382	8884844	It's Bobby Hey, Bobby, good to hear from you.
8884864	8885504	What's up, buddy?
8909773	8910273	Nothing much.
8910313	8912074	You guys were talking a lot about G4 earlier.
8912374	8913335	Yes, we were.
8913495	8916316	In fact, we dedicated a whole segment of our show to it tonight.
8917056	8918497	And I didn't dedicate anything.
8919257	8919578	I know.
8919618	8920378	What's up with that?
8921458	8928822	I'm a little conflicted just because of my past and stuff with G4, and I'm trying to figure out how I want to say what I want to say.
8929462	8933764	Okay, well, for those that don't know, tell us a little bit about what the past is for you.
8934384	8935585	Okay, so for those that...
8937250	8944656	Don't, you know, well, I mean, obviously we came from All Games and Scott Rubin, but I had met Scott Rubin a long time before then.
8945357	8946338	I met him in 97.
8947498	8953583	And he was one of the people that started G4 after the first incarnation of All Games went away in the dot-com bust.
8954460	8961545	So I was pretty much right there at the formation and creation of G4 as an outsider, as a volunteer.
8963687	8970332	Back when we just knew it was something that a Disney guy was going to be starting with Comcast.
8970872	8971793	And that's all we knew about it.
8973085	8981489	I was there when they launched the site in April of 2002 and the network didn't go on the air until for a couple months later, I think.
8982489	8987212	And so I was there and I actually was the first forum moderator over the G4 forums.
8987292	8989753	I ran the chat room for about two years.
8989873	8994035	I was on the majority of the shows that were on G4 at some point.
8994815	8999040	I actually have a VHS tape that's like 30 minutes long of every single time I was either mentioned or shown.
8999180	9002224	I never realized that you were actually on the network at some point.
9002324	9003125	I never realized that.
9003185	9003545	I was.
9004146	9004686	I was the...
9005999	9034782	for some of the shows I was like the backup caller because they had a talk show G4TV.com which was hosted by Scott Rubin and Laura Foy and Tina Wood and they taped they would do a live stream of their taping but since it was a TV show it was like a five hour taping and so we were all kind of in the audience and they would take calls and sometimes I would be the one who would call in and I'd work out with the producer what I talk about or I would be the backup if the guy that they wanted to call in flaked out
9035754	9050406	and so I would have to make up stuff about games I've never played and act as a caller like there was one about Splinter Cell and you know me, I would never play Splinter Cell but I actually called into the show once it was still me, I wasn't playing a character or anything talking about Splinter Cell
9051748	9052448	It's really funny.
9052568	9056852	I do want to make a minor correction to something you said because you said we came from all games.
9057893	9062838	That was our previous home prior to this, but we had started elsewhere before.
9062898	9066361	So we were around on our own live 365 thing when G4 started.
9066761	9072186	So we were those viewers out there that was kind of little critical and cynical of what was going on on G4 television.
9072907	9076210	I was also critical and cynical because I left.
9076730	9078272	Yeah, yeah.
9078552	9093325	And it was basically, I mean, everybody... And it's kind of funny because my version of G4 is different from other people's version of G4 because I stopped my involvement with G4 about the same time Scott did, which was right after the Tech TV merger because I didn't like the way they handled it.
9093666	9097089	And to a lot of people, when they say, oh, G4, they think the screensavers.
9097489	9098490	They think Call for Help.
9098530	9099271	They think X-Play.
9099611	9100472	That wasn't G4.
9101413	9102214	That was Tech TV.
9103684	9114496	The G4 that I remember was mostly G4TV.com and Icons and Cinematek and Pulse and Portal and Arena and all those.
9116118	9117960	They had some great ideas.
9118000	9124467	The execution was lacking just because of budget, but they didn't give them a chance to actually get the budget for any of those shows.
9127472	9128874	I remember Pringles Presents.
9129535	9130656	Yeah, that was cheat.
9130816	9131937	Pringles presented cheat.
9132358	9139466	But what was interesting is because I actually did get to meet most of the hosts from the 2002 to 2004, including the illustrious Will Wheaton.
9140267	9141748	And they all kind of knew who I was.
9142549	9171557	just through the forum posts and stuff because they interacted some and I would be the liaison sometimes and a lot of them a lot of the hosts actually did know what they were talking about with video games which was the main complaint everybody had about the original G4 hosts is that they didn't know what they were talking about they were just reading a teleprompter two or three of them were reading teleprompter and didn't know but I could actually have intelligent conversations with the majority of the hosts of all the G4 shows about video games and that's one thing a lot of people didn't realize back before the merger
9172850	9174450	Why do you think people didn't get that?
9174750	9177011	Why do you think that got lost in translation?
9177091	9178691	Was that overproduction?
9178831	9185072	And I see Tigercloss in our chat says, the G4TV.com show was heavily scripted.
9185373	9187513	The callers couldn't call in and call about whatever they wanted.
9187573	9190874	Is that because maybe they took some of the organicness out of it?
9191554	9197335	Yes, because basically it was a video game channel being made by cable television executives.
9198211	9215476	so they followed the cable television model they didn't know that much about video games they just they thought they knew the way to do it and that's one of the reasons Scott Rubin left was because he couldn't get into their head that they were doing it all wrong and they didn't listen to him because all he had done is web stuff he didn't know how cable industry worked
9216138	9217198	Josh Crane and Jim Downs
9244329	9250631	also worked with Sudo and the All Games Network, and Josh Crane became an executive at G4.
9250651	9254793	He's no longer with them, and Jim Downs was a producer who was also no longer with the network.
9254853	9266857	So none of them are with the network anymore, but there were some people that are still there, and I don't know if they're still going to be with the network after the change or what, because they kind of did more generic stuff with the TV network.
9267017	9270718	I was going to say, is there anybody still at G4 that was there at the very beginning?
9271298	9277065	Yes, there's one guy, his name's Derek, I'm not going to give his last name, but people who probably from the All Games era know who I'm talking about.
9277325	9278066	He is still there.
9278907	9280849	And he's the only one I really know of that is still there.
9281910	9282191	Wow.
9283132	9289399	And he was also kind of from that pseudo-online, he might have been, I don't know if he was flown from New York, but I know he was one of Scott's friends.
9289770	9302365	So let me ask this, I mean, you know, obviously this news has you a little conflicted because it is kind of rough to see the last remnants of G4 disappearing, but these shows were tech TV shows that are the last.
9302786	9305229	So didn't this all kind of already end five years ago?
9305979	9307799	I think it all, well, G4 to me ended in 2004.
9308119	9311220	And I liked tech TV, too.
9311280	9312220	I watched both networks.
9312260	9314401	I watched the screensavers every day on tech TV.
9315201	9320062	And the reason G4 bought, well, the reason, I'll kind of explain because you read some of my comments.
9320642	9324623	Basically, Paul Allen, who was one of the VPs of Microsoft, he bought a lot of things.
9324663	9329724	And he's the guy that started tech TV because he wanted a cable television network about technology.
9330384	9331064	He got bored with it.
9332148	9335489	and said, you know, I know you guys are about to pull a profit and pull high ratings.
9335529	9336930	You know, Tech TV was on the rise.
9337310	9338050	He's like, but I'm bored.
9339030	9340671	And Comcast is offering money, so I want it.
9340711	9344552	And Comcast wanted Tech TV because G4 could not get on DirecTV.
9345232	9345612	They couldn't.
9345832	9347213	DirecTV rejected them.
9347913	9349133	Said that we don't want your content.
9349413	9350534	Tech TV was already on...
9351550	9354712	DirectTV, so that was their Trojan horse.
9355452	9363738	And so they became G4 Tech TV, and this is why they actually did that, because they could not change the type of network until they renegotiated the contract with DirectTV.
9364758	9371903	So in order to be broadcast on TechTV's signal, they had to retain TechTV's type of content.
9372543	9376606	And that's why they kept the screensavers and kept some of the other TechTV-type stuff
9377506	9384139	and became G4 Tech TV and then once they renegotiated the contract they went back to G4 interesting
9386691	9411226	and it's funny, I told you I was going to tell this story in chat about one of my most famous acts one of the acts that has shaped cable television that I did or at least I claim to do and when I say this story, realize that at the time I believed this was true and to his credit, the other person played along and told me it was true
9411966	9412947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9435598	9439000	to help him get leverage over the director.
9439020	9440840	So now it's two voices instead of just one.
9441401	9451325	Because G4TV.com really devolved into what can we make Laura Foy and Tina Wood do to appease the teenager male demographic.
9451785	9460809	And that's why they did the challenges that had the gross ending to it or whatever, the humiliation at the end.
9462010	9462130	And
9463432	9470671	In comes chat one day is somebody that I kind of remember from the old pseudo days from Shooters, which is one of the old All Games Network shows, Captain Emmy.
9471876	9475378	and he was sitting there talking about how he didn't like where he was.
9475398	9487462	He was working at some public access station or some real old TV station and I knew Scott was looking for a production assistant but Scott actually told me he didn't want me to come out for it because I wouldn't get paid enough.
9488783	9494865	But I told Captain Emmy that, hey, Scott's looking for this guy for a production assistant.
9494885	9496386	He's like, oh, no, I couldn't ask him for that.
9496406	9497046	I'm like, no, really.
9497787	9499447	He's looking for somebody to fill the job.
9501428	9505049	and Scott comes into chat and I'm like, hey Scott, Captain Emmy's looking for a job.
9505970	9507010	And it was, oh really?
9508070	9514272	And to kind of tie the story together, Captain Emmy was the screen name for Kevin Pereira.
9515653	9521615	So I believe for the longest time, and to Kevin's credit, he agreed with me that I got him his job at G4.
9523010	9530816	Now, the real version is more like Kevin knew the job was open, he was coming into chat just to see when Scott was around to talk to him about it.
9530856	9531076	But he...
9532491	9537914	He'll play along and say that I kind of pointed him in the direction when I think that was the direction he was going in anyway.
9537934	9539494	I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
9540034	9546057	So yeah, in some ways you can blame me for Kevin even being hired at G4 in the first place.
9546337	9551159	Or maybe thank you in the case of Alan and what he said during the listless segment tonight.
9551179	9551979	So there you go.
9555740	9558841	The shows I liked on G4 the most were actually not produced by G4.
9558901	9562682	Electric Playground and Judgment Day were from Greedy Productions.
9562702	9563562	They're still in business.
9563722	9568044	Electric Playground is actually the longest running television show about video games in the world.
9568624	9569444	It's been running since 1995.
9571805	9573885	They actually recently went daily.
9573905	9575026	They're mainly Canadian.
9575706	9580209	They're produced up in Vancouver and Judgment Day is actually just a reskinning of their show Reviews on the Run.
9580769	9588694	G4 wanted something specific and so they took the Reviews on the Run footage that had Victor Lucas and Tommy Tallarico and put G4 graphics around it.
9589134	9589835	And that's all they did.
9589895	9591556	So in Canada it was Reviews on the Run.
9592096	9592957	Here it was Judgment Day.
9592977	9599241	They still do Reviews on the Run and what's funny is Tommy Tallarico no longer does any of that stuff because he's so busy with Video Games Live.
9599901	9627710	but one of the people that does reviews on Reviews on the Run was kind of like me in the same sense that we were in the G4 forums together and kind of attached to specific shows and personalities I attach to Scott Rubin, I do podcasts this guy, Jose Sanchez he went by Fubar attached himself to Victor Lucas and he now is one of the hosts on Reviews on the Run he was a production assistant there for Greedy for the longest time and worked his way up wow, that's awesome huh
9629341	9658987	well it's been story time with Bobby Blackwolf but this is this is good it's kind of neat to hear the history and I hope you do end up doing your piece for VOG Network about kind of reflecting on it gosh I'm trying to think what else to ask you with this thing but do you think there is a future for video game television do you think somebody else we don't know of yet could come in and start a video game network or is it just you know what no video game stuff is always going to be on the internet this is something always internet based
9660201	9663585	There's only one way, I think.
9663725	9665226	Basically, I'm looking to Korea.
9666127	9671512	The only way that we can get a video game channel is if esports takes off in America the way it's taken off in Korea.
9672633	9674075	That's the only way I think it'll happen.
9674115	9678459	I don't think we're going to see a generic video game network like G4.
9678579	9680200	G4 tried a whole bunch of different things.
9680220	9681882	They didn't have all new shows.
9681922	9683443	They had one show that was a scripted show.
9684304	9686408	and it was about and took place in MMOs.
9686448	9691556	It was an early machinima show using a whole bunch of different MMOs to tell this overarching story.
9691576	9697506	It was Portal and they tried stuff like that and it didn't really take off.
9698522	9701906	and I don't think anybody has the patience to make that take off.
9702566	9716180	But I think with esports, I think if esports does take off, if League of Legends takes off or StarCraft or something we don't know about yet, we may be able to get a dedicated esports channel, but that's probably as close as we're going to be able to get.
9717513	9724136	I would see it probably ending up more being an esports show on the Ocho, you know, or something along those lines.
9724236	9726177	But I don't know.
9727498	9733681	I'd like to be able to see something, and hopefully it will be less corporate controlled.
9733741	9739484	I mean, I know that's just looking at it through such, you know, dream pie-in-the-sky ideals, but...
9740544	9747369	Yeah, it sounds like a lot of the crap that happened on both G4 and Tech TV were just bad executive decisions.
9748049	9755154	But, and I'm going to point this out, Leo Laporte tweeted this week, Attack of the Show and X-Play on G4 lasted eight years.
9755214	9757116	That was longer than any show on Tech TV.
9758977	9759437	That's true.
9760118	9764161	Because Tech TV started in, I think, 99, and they were off the air in 2004.
9766604	9767045	Good point.
9767926	9771750	All right, well, Bobby, before we let you go to take more calls, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
9773071	9774353	I've been doing a lot of interviews lately.
9774673	9775134	Yes, you have.
9775154	9775995	And they've been pretty good.
9776215	9776876	Yes, you have.
9778475	9780497	I've got a big interview show next week.
9780537	9783739	I'm not live, but I've got some big interviews.
9783779	9786842	Hotline Miami, which is a new indie game that everybody's loving right now.
9788103	9791465	And then MechWarrior Online and Fallen Enchantress.
9791645	9793006	All those interviews next week.
9793086	9798791	I interviewed a local studio about their first-person Magic game this week, earlier tonight.
9799551	9802313	They're Xavier, and actually a lot of their developers were in chat.
9803263	9803523	and stuff.
9803563	9810310	And I've already gotten an email from them thanking me for it and telling me that it sounds like one of the quotes I said may be on the back of the box in two years.
9810551	9810911	Oh, wow.
9811251	9811952	Which would be awesome.
9812172	9812853	That's awesome.
9813334	9817358	Unfortunately, I wasn't the one that initially said the quote Dungeon Buster did, so I don't know how this works.
9819280	9821802	But they specific because it's a first-person magic game and...
9822563	9830928	Dungeon Buster in chat was like, so it's kind of like Skyrim's magic system done right, and I repeated that, and that's what they quoted in the interview that they really appreciated hearing.
9832189	9832869	Interesting.
9832929	9833990	All right, well, we'll see what happens.
9835150	9842655	Well, yeah, if you're not already tuning in an hour early at vognetwork.com before OLR, you're missing out on a great, Bobby's having a great year.
9842715	9845617	I mean, not that like the other seven sucked, but you're having a great year.
9846517	9847638	But I still got snubbed.
9850451	9852353	Don't go there.
9852413	9854176	Did you look at the list of who got nominated?
9854236	9855938	It's a lot of corp stuff.
9856599	9862447	And I think the corporate stuff gets nominated because people want to make a complete ballot and they don't know who else to nominate.
9864429	9884071	but uh yep there you go uh Bobby you you definitely earned a place in our hearts oh thank you all right all right well Bobby I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls okay okay all right have a good one buddy you too bye that was fun reminiscing with Bobby we have another call coming right in though so let's get to the phones hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this
9886480	9894763	Oh my gosh, I thought I heard wind in the background there.
9894823	9896123	Is the storm rolling in?
9896503	9898384	Are you getting blown by Sandy right now?
9898404	9900224	What?
9900244	9900744	It's going to rain.
9910822	9912103	Yes, yes, yes.
9912484	9916707	Right now, I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Travis and Jessica.
9916928	9921131	Last August, when Irene, Rita, I was going to stand up in here.
9922553	9923013	What's that?
9924274	9925515	It's windy as hell.
9926076	9927297	It's a little bit of rain.
9928418	9933543	The shoreline of Jersey has been more or less flooded out, but this Jersey, no one cares.
9934502	9936024	It's the important things in life.
9936164	9939407	Alright, I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about the hurricane though.
9939427	9941109	What did you really want to talk about?
9961232	9965554	Well, there was something else that we had did as part of my podcast.
9965934	9972217	On Friday, we went to an event in Lower Manhattan called Girl Gamers Meetup New York City.
9973618	9974579	But you're not a girl.
9976339	9978280	No, but some of my staffers are.
9978640	9979321	Okay, that works.
9979341	9980862	He's meeting up with a lot of the girls.
9980882	9981382	That's right.
9981702	9983363	You just went to go get some phone numbers.
9983443	9984003	No, I'm kidding.
9984023	9984443	I'm kidding.
9984703	9985244	That sounds fun.
9986559	9988440	Oh, we'll save that for another time.
9991082	9991442	Nice.
9992943	9993603	Why, thank you.
9994383	10003968	But pretty much the point of the meetup was to get more girls involved into playing video games to prove that it's not just boys and men that are playing.
10004009	10008611	Girls and women play video games, and they can kick as much ass as their counterparts.
10008871	10009431	Absolutely.
10009612	10010292	Right, DarkSakura?
10011348	10011628	Right.
10012528	10014349	She said right, but you can't hear her anymore.
10014829	10017650	I'm sorry, everything's just exploding because the Giants apparently won.
10018630	10020011	Oh, is that their fourth game?
10020391	10020651	Yeah.
10021091	10021651	Oh, boy.
10022152	10023092	That's it, then.
10023952	10026213	I'm so glad I didn't go to San Francisco this weekend.
10026293	10029434	I am so glad because, oh.
10029614	10039797	Well, given that I am a born and bred New Yorker, trust me, we feel the pain of not being there, and whereas there are the Mets fans that are like, well, this is really going to happen.
10062074	10064555	No problem.
10064635	10075041	Well, what we did was we got a chance to interview Jen Vargas, the founder and creator of Girl Game Revolt.
10075421	10085167	The point of our creating this is to prove that girls are just as good as gamers as guys, and to break the stereotype and prove that there is a difference between
10085632	10087392	Girl Gamers, and Gamer Girls.
10087412	10093694	You know, the type of girls who sit there and they kind of look sexy with a controller and, you know, they don't like that.
10097055	10097735	Well, you still there?
10099215	10099835	I'm still here.
10099895	10101016	Can you hear me good, sir?
10101196	10101576	Yes, I can.
10101596	10102616	What was that last part you said?
10104116	10110778	I said the last part was about how to try to break the stereotypes and prove there is a difference between girl gamers and gamer girls.
10112172	10113432	Ah, okay, okay.
10113572	10117073	So Olivia Munn is not necessarily a representation of gamer girls everywhere.
10117593	10118174	I get what you mean.
10118474	10119034	Exactly.
10119214	10119934	Absolutely.
10120014	10133417	And they had some gamer girls there in costume talking about their YouTube channels and how they give tutorials on how to play various games, how to get through certain action games, and they had a theme.
10133697	10140279	They were playing, we had Gears of War 3 with zombie mods, Left 4 Dead 2, Gauntlet, and Friday the 13th.
10143655	10145896	Friday the 13th, like the 8-bit NES game?
10147156	10147397	Yes.
10147717	10148277	Yes, it was.
10148677	10149037	Amazing.
10149337	10150798	So where can we hear these interviews?
10152498	10158800	Well, we are holding on to them because NRA Jam Session is so ever grateful to Orange Knowledge Radio.
10159000	10161781	This interview that we did is exclusive to OLR.
10163034	10163554	Oh, awesome.
10163574	10164975	We're going to play that next week.
10165355	10170797	So not only will we have Eddie from A Money Style with us, but we're going to play that interview as well on the show.
10170937	10172317	So thank you so much for doing that for us.
10173618	10174258	No problem.
10174278	10177379	When this popped up, the first person I thought of was my darling group, John.
10179056	10179636	Oh, barf.
10180457	10181457	Hey, shut up.
10182198	10183559	I brought you vanilla tootsie rolls.
10183619	10184059	You did.
10184079	10184339	You did.
10184359	10184940	They're delicious.
10185520	10186381	Talk about barf.
10187121	10187402	Shut up.
10187762	10202412	Since you are the man behind the anime show, and I know you have a whole staff behind you, but since you are the guy on the show here representing Anime Jam Session, I've got to ask you, I don't know, did you hear that email about the anime that's Nintendo and Sega and all that?
10202452	10203253	Did you hear that email?
10204645	10206867	No, I did not.
10207107	10212091	We may have to investigate and talk about that on our show coming up on this Thursday.
10212151	10212871	You need to.
10212951	10214212	I'll send you more information.
10214292	10220917	It's available on Crunchyroll, apparently, for free, and it's inspired by old Sega characters, apparently.
10220957	10221758	Do you remember the name of it?
10222238	10224420	Aoi no... Aoi Sekai no Chushinde.
10224560	10224940	There you go.
10224980	10225641	Wow, very good.
10225801	10226081	Good memory.
10226101	10228203	Because I'm actually looking at the page right now on Wikipedia.
10228483	10229344	Fantastic memory.
10229364	10229804	Because...
10230605	10232306	I linked myself so I would find it.
10232886	10234528	I just linked it on my Facebook, Ranjan.
10236589	10236989	Gotcha.
10237010	10239091	I will definitely check that when I go back inside.
10239611	10239932	Awesome.
10240332	10241713	Alright, well, Ranma, be safe.
10242434	10243294	Don't float away.
10243454	10244035	We will.
10244435	10244735	Alright.
10244775	10245436	We will.
10245476	10246056	We're good.
10246076	10247197	We have enough battery backup.
10247237	10248438	We have enough alcohol.
10248678	10250440	We are good to go for the next 48 hours.
10250620	10251521	Sounds good.
10251541	10253142	Fill the bathtub with water.
10254843	10255343	We can't.
10255384	10257305	We don't have a stopper for the water.
10257365	10258426	We are so blown up.
10259472	10259973	Oh, no.
10260333	10262095	Get every glass in the cupboard and fill it up.
10262135	10262575	Condoms.
10264357	10264677	All right.
10265037	10266018	I'm ending this conversation.
10266318	10267059	Bye, Ranma.
10267079	10267500	Be safe.
10268641	10269001	Bye.
10269041	10270462	You safe driver is good, sir.
10270763	10271103	All right.
10273334	10274235	Thank you so much, Ranma.
10274615	10277157	And thank you to everybody that called in tonight, both our callers.
10277517	10280699	Since both those calls were a little long, we're going to wrap it up.
10280759	10281479	I'm sorry.
10281940	10284761	But we still got to do some more last-minute stories on our Twitter topics.
10285022	10286843	So we're not even close to being done yet.
10286963	10288344	We don't want to go for four hours tonight.
10288804	10291646	So, Loki, do you have other last-minute stories before I get to the tweets?
10291786	10294947	Yeah, the John Sisters Twisted Dreams is now available.
10295348	10298149	You can get that on Steam as part of the Greenlight thing.
10298790	10300511	I actually have a token for it.
10300531	10301692	I just have to download it now.
10303053	10310499	Um, Zynga's bringing FarmVille, or I should say, you know, their online stuff, into online gambling.
10310779	10324210	Apparently they're planning on doing a slot-based simu- or slot simulator based on FarmVille, and, um, may expand into other online casino or bidding type things, so...
10325231	10330658	I think they have like Farmville Casino, like actual slot machines, like real slot machines.
10330939	10334463	I want to say they do have those, so I'm not surprised there.
10335304	10339670	And of course, they lost $52.7 million in quarter three.
10340130	10343555	Probably why they had to fire a lot of people or lay off.
10345077	10348741	I think people are just kind of over those type of games now.
10348821	10351885	Although, then again, I get all these invites for FarmVille too, so maybe not.
10352946	10354668	Let me do some quick Twitter topics here.
10355769	10361816	I liked this tweet here, and I have to admit I'm not informed on the topic very much, but I'll try here.
10362717	10369523	Nijela tweeted us, don't know if the Florence Gate saga has made it on your radar.
10369643	10372325	Raises interesting questions about games journalism.
10372886	10379151	Now apparently what happened, and he links us to something that's on Reddit, and here's the deal.
10379271	10380953	According to what I see on Reddit here,
10381633	10389716	Robert Florence just stepped down from Eurogamer because of his column yesterday, Blasting Games Journalists and Their Relationship to PR.
10390456	10395638	And he links to a tweet from the author that says, Yesterday was my last piece for Eurogamer.
10395738	10397118	Here it is in amended form.
10397458	10399899	I stand by every word of the original piece.
10400459	10403040	And I remember reading this original piece.
10403260	10405921	Somebody linked it to me because it was all around Twitter.
10405961	10408582	And I'm like, why are all these people joking about Doritos and Mountain Dew?
10408622	10409282	Somebody fill me in.
10409982	10412204	I remember reading this original piece.
10412804	10422391	Now, I'm not sure I understand why this was so flippin' terrible, although I noticed there is an editor's note.
10423231	10432538	Following receipt of a complaint from Lauren Wainwright, Eurogamer has removed part of this article, but without admission of any liability.
10432978	10435580	Eurogamer apologizes for any distress caused to Ms.
10435600	10437201	Wainwright by the references to her.
10437561	10440303	This article otherwise remains as originally published.
10440764	10446428	Now, because I don't have a photographic memory, I don't know what that means was cut from the article.
10446628	10462260	My assumption, bolded, italicized, underlined, was that it probably had to do with a particular PR rep or PR firm that was kind of doing some things that might be considered questionable.
10462300	10464362	The whole thing's about basically...
10466021	10468983	How tight of a hold does PR have on games journalism?
10469003	10469843	How do you spell her last name?
10472725	10473125	Right there.
10473825	10474506	Son of a bitch.
10475466	10477607	I hit the button on my iPad that takes me back to start.
10477667	10478028	Hold on.
10478888	10479448	Son of a bitch.
10479568	10480409	Alright, there it is right there.
10480429	10481149	There's the name for you.
10481830	10482610	Can I zoom in on that?
10482670	10484251	No, because it's an iPad specific site.
10486676	10487236	So there you go.
10487356	10492920	I'm looking for the... BlackWolf says he quoted the public Twitter of Lauren Weinreich.
10493581	10498083	Her outlet threatened libel, which is nasty in UK libel laws.
10498484	10512052	They quoted her public Twitter about how she was okay with promoting hashtags to win a PlayStation 3 and then talked about how she was promoting Tomb Raider and then uncovered that she actually works as a freelancer for Square Enix.
10512413	10513874	Do I need to call back in?
10513954	10514274	Maybe...
10514654	10527107	You have a better memory than I, sir, because I remember looking at the original article and I was like, yeah, I could have told you that for a long time now, basically, that PR has its grip firmly on hold of a lot of games journalism.
10527648	10531011	That's why I've always said indies are the best, because...
10531952	10542016	Even though not everybody, you know, is, you know, some of these indie gamers are probably the first ones to do the, or indie folks are probably the first ones to do these hashtags to try and win a PlayStation 3.
10543396	10546137	A lot of times that's where the most honesty is going to come from as well.
10546857	10548938	So, thank you, Bobby, for setting us straight.
10551092	10554013	That kind of sucks that it cost this guy his job, though.
10554634	10556855	There's a quote from Forbes, by the way.
10557755	10558676	Go join Polygon.
10561337	10562297	They sound like a group.
10562517	10565038	They're like a Voltron of game people.
10565118	10566079	That's where you need to be, buddy.
10567720	10570841	Apparently... Wow.
10571281	10571581	All right.
10573022	10582051	She has, okay, since then, Lauren Wainwright has had personal verbal attacks, sent to her Twitter, which she has now locked, her Steam account, and other networking sites.
10582071	10584533	Well, now that's crossing the line ridiculousness.
10584894	10586255	But this is coming from other people.
10586856	10590860	Okay, this was actually on Reddit, is where I'm finding this.
10590920	10592401	I'm just going to read a little bit of it, if you don't mind.
10592421	10593002	Mm-hmm.
10593682	10597065	Robert Florence wrote an article calling out unprofessional behavior in gaming journalism.
10597125	10599666	He then steps down from his job at Eurogamer.
10599986	10600967	That's so he quit.
10601067	10602388	He wasn't fired.
10603048	10611154	Because of this article, as he was told, he would be sued for libel against Lauren Wainwright since, in the uncensored version, he outed her for questionable behavior.
10611534	10616457	Since then, she's had personal attacks at her Twitter, her Steam account, other networking sites.
10616898	10623042	The Forbes article states, it only takes a few bad apples to turn a conversation about free speech and journalism into one about misogyny.
10623762	10626265	So apparently people have been taking this really seriously.
10629367	10633531	He was calling out integrity and people were turning it around as an attack, so...
10634464	10638806	Black Wolf says, Ben Kuchera did a great article about this whole thing on Penny Arcade Report.
10639147	10640327	That doesn't surprise me at all.
10640387	10644810	He's pretty good about taking these situations and putting them into perspective.
10646851	10653214	I have to admit, again, the core issue, we've all known about that for a very long time.
10653274	10658937	But this whole fallout, and especially now that part where people were threatening her on Twitter and shit, that's...
10661629	10663410	That's stupid and that's unfortunate.
10664030	10664530	What else can I say?
10664550	10667311	I'm just trying to see if anybody's published the unedited.
10669812	10670072	All right.
10670352	10672553	Well, anyway, let me get some more of these tweets here.
10673453	10679475	Sertour tweeted us and said, I love Bobby Blackwolf and OLR so much and VOG Network.
10680155	10681255	Well, we love you too.
10682255	10683536	DarkSakura sends kisses.
10684899	10685580	Snotty ones.
10688204	10688525	Let's see.
10689206	10695715	SSJ100Matt tweeted us and said, Hey folks, I just want to let you know you guys are keeping me company right now on my three-hour drive to Boston.
10695896	10696276	Thank you.
10697037	10697578	You're welcome.
10698079	10698920	Three-hour drive?
10699541	10700182	That's a long drive.
10704085	10709132	Tiger Claw tweets us, the Mass Effect movie moves forward with a new screenwriter.
10710033	10713438	I know y'all love your Mass Effect, especially if your name is Shane or DarkSakura.
10713918	10718464	So let me read this link here that we got tweeted to from SlashFilm.
10719685	10728028	Apparently, screenwriter Morgan Davis-Fole has been hired to make a new pass at the script for Mass Effect.
10729468	10736090	This is the first big movement on the project since 2010 when Legendary Pictures purchased the right to the franchise.
10737070	10740091	This writer, though, he has yet to have a script produced.
10740991	10741552	Interesting.
10742392	10749779	But I guess he wrote Alien Sleeper Cell and worked on Rescue Me as well as some Happy Madison films.
10749939	10750420	Oh, God.
10751601	10752141	Oh, God.
10752201	10753603	That's not sounding good so far.
10754203	10763752	But he's a massive Mass Effect fan and producers liked his take after obviously deciding not to move forward with the original script by Mark Protosevich.
10764993	10765714	Interesting.
10766375	10777406	Alright, well as long as it's more Rescue Me and less Happy Madison, I'll be alright, because he actually is a fan of the games, but on behalf of the entire fan community, do not fuck this up.
10777526	10780429	Do not, not fuck this up.
10780529	10782892	TigerClaw gives us one more tweet here about
10784548	10790712	EA taking a part in American Cancer Society's Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk.
10791372	10793934	It's nice to hear about the good things EA did.
10794414	10795755	So let's talk about this.
10795815	10797797	He links us to a story from Game Politics.
10798217	10801219	Team EA took part in the American Cancer Society's
10801599	10807803	making strides against Breast Cancer Walk in San Francisco to raise funds for the fight against breast cancer.
10808383	10815107	EA Chief Operating Officer Peter Moore was on hand to kick off the event and walked with the employees.
10815967	10816768	So very cool.
10817328	10822731	Good on you, EA, for doing your public service for an important cause.
10823692	10824312	So there you go.
10824412	10826393	Thank you guys very much for your tweets tonight.
10826433	10828915	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10829295	10832100	And yes, TigerClaw, I know there's one more tweet, but it's a two tweet maximum.
10834083	10835965	Loki, any other last minute stories you want to share tonight?
10836907	10843918	Yeah, PopCap and EA are teaming up with the ADA to give you free Plants vs. Zombies for Halloween.
10844406	10845227	I've got an email on that.
10845767	10848550	It's stopzombiemouth.com.
10849211	10849991	It's kind of cool, though.
10850031	10857238	I mean, if you're trying to be cheap about giving out candy and stuff like that, you could be one of those people that gives out something else.
10857698	10860001	Well, they have coupons that you can print off.
10860541	10869830	Basically, they have a code on there that can be used between October 30th and November 10th to redeem a free copy of the PC version of Plants vs. Zombies for PC or Mac.
10870850	10894015	and um it's all the same code so you can print off sheets of those cut them up and give those out instead of candy if you want to or with candy or with candy um and so you can do that if you don't feel like going to and basically just go back to the stopzombiemouth.com website and then use the code p-hater p-e-a-h-a-t-r
10896445	10896866	Peahatter.
10897548	10898511	One of the plants is a peahat.
10903244	10904245	It could be either way.
10904425	10907788	I think it's a pee-hater because they don't like getting hit in the face with pee.
10907928	10908308	Who knows?
10909429	10911791	Not, you know, urine.
10912651	10913292	So there's that.
10913532	10919696	And then, of course, also this I was kind of talking about before I actually got to read the whole thing now.
10920197	10926422	Apparently there's going to be some updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
10927082	10932606	Remember before how it was okay to jailbreak your iPods and iPhones and stuff like that?
10933767	10934908	Not going to be the case anymore.
10935088	10943315	Apparently, it's only legal to jailbreak phones or say unlocked prior to January 2013.
10945777	10948819	Basically, after that, it is no longer legal to do that.
10948959	10955164	Also, it's no longer legal to jailbreak tablet devices or root tablet devices.
10956960	10958020	That's kind of unfortunate.
10958521	10960581	Kind of a big step backwards to the whole thing.
10966644	10971626	There's more websites running that whole Disney toy box thing, but we already know what that is, right?
10972066	10974007	I gotta say, Disney Infinity has a great logo.
10974867	10975687	It does have a nice logo.
10977731	10983296	It's very interesting that they have two different components of the game.
10985398	10987821	One of which would be, let's see here.
10989465	10991666	Pages not turning correctly.
10992587	10995189	One of which was dubbed the Toy Box.
10995969	11000552	And one, of course, is the actual characters, the play sets.
11000832	11002333	So they're the play sets in the Toy Box.
11003153	11012019	And of course, tying in with Monsters U, Cars, The Lone Ranger, The Incredibles, Toy Story, and Pirates of the Caribbean.
11013416	11017279	And like we talked about last week... It's two Johnny Depp movies, if I'm not mistaken.
11017499	11019681	Yes, it is, because he's in a lot of stuff.
11020081	11021042	And it looks interesting.
11021702	11022883	They've got a picture here.
11023264	11025305	The reader looks really different.
11025505	11028007	Not like, you know, say...
11029148	11045361	Skylanders, but they've got these characters and these coins and then looks like boss characters, almost like they have that mech thing from The Incredibles, so you can team up with Buzz Lightyear and Mr. Incredible and stuff.
11045621	11045981	Oh, neat.
11047583	11047883	I don't know.
11048323	11049144	Very interesting.
11049164	11050065	I hope the game's good.
11050585	11057751	I think it probably will be, I mean, considering how well Skylanders does, and Skylanders, to be honest, is a very new property versus...
11058752	11061234	and Disney characters, which everybody fucking knows.
11063576	11067821	All right, well, before we wrap up the show tonight, I bet you thought I forgot, but I didn't.
11069554	11072016	We have to reveal the winners of tonight's list list.
11072316	11076880	It just took me forever to tabulate the votes because there was a lot of participation tonight and I've been talking a lot.
11077381	11080844	So let's reveal tonight's winners of the list list.
11080864	11089771	Here it is, the definitive list, the top three things scientifically proven that you guys want on G4 to get you to watch it again.
11089851	11091353	Number three is a tie.
11092233	11093454	The screensavers.
11094742	11098205	and the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show.
11099506	11100567	The number three answer.
11100867	11104890	The number two thing that would most get you to watch G4 again.
11105951	11108693	Starcade 2 Electric Boogaloo.
11110834	11120342	And lastly, the number one, the numero uno thing, the thing that G4 ought to book right now to get everybody to watch it again.
11121624	11123807	Loki's Cosplay Challenge!
11124728	11125168	Yay!
11125269	11126530	At least I'll be getting paid!
11130755	11134920	Loki's Cosplay Challenge is the thing you most want on G4 TV.
11135020	11135701	There it is.
11136202	11138665	Signed, sealed, delivered, done.
11139674	11143057	Alright, well that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

11204967	11208089	But Blackwolf says we should green light the earth.
11208209	11210050	We may green light that for VOG.
11210130	11211551	Loki's costume is not going to happen.
11214053	11214894	Sorry to disappoint you.
