0	7000	Forge, Lounge, Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, October 28th, 2012. Has the Playstation 3 been hacked again?
19000	27000	Zynga makes some big layoffs. And could not all Wii U features make the system launch?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this October the 28th of 2012, episode number 479 of our show.
45000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all that good stuff with my co-host.
51000	57000	My co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. How are you doing?
57000	59000	You're like sick and stuff, huh?
59000	60000	I have a sinus infection.
60000	61000	You better not be contagious.
61000	63000	Sinus infections aren't contagious.
63000	66000	Last time you had a sinus infection I got the swine flu.
66000	67000	You know what, Rob? Okay.
67000	69000	I'm never going to let you live that down.
69000	71000	No, that's from not eating enough pork.
71000	73000	Oh, hi Tech Master, Loki. How are you?
73000	75000	You mentioned pork, sorry.
75000	77000	Alright, what were you going to say, DarkSakura?
77000	82000	I was going to say I thought I had a sinus infection and then I ended up getting really sick.
82000	90000	I ended up not having a very bad version of it and you ended up being, what, bedridden or something?
90000	92000	So, sorry.
92000	101000	I can't help it if my immune system is wonderful, Rob, and that everything is just weak sauce when it hits me.
101000	103000	Alright, well if you want to join-
103000	105000	I am stronger than the swine flu.
105000	110000	If you want to join us and talk about sickness or games would be preferred, but you never know.
110000	117000	Live.vognetwork.com is where you can chat along with us and you can also check in if you are listening live.
117000	118000	Yes, those are on now.
118000	123000	Man, if it's not up by like the first second the intro music hits, I start getting private messages.
123000	125000	Check-ins are down, check-ins are down, check-ins are down.
125000	127000	But check-ins are now on for Orange Lounge Radio.
127000	129000	A little bit late. Thanks, Bobby.
129000	132000	We are, of course, live after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
132000	137000	We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf at the Voice of Geeks Network.
137000	140000	vognetwork.com.
140000	145000	Lots of great shows that play on VOG throughout the week, including my other show that's all about the World of Warcraft.
145000	149000	The best little Horde house in Azeroth, or Horde house for short.
149000	156000	And the reason why I bring that up, crossover week this week with Girls Gone Wow, our friends over there in the UK.
156000	160000	And we were on their show today and they're going to come on Horde house later this week.
160000	164000	So it's crossover week. Why? Because sweeps month is coming up.
164000	168000	Sweeps month. So that's when we got to pull out all the stunts.
168000	174000	Crossover shows, super special episodes, and at the end of the month somebody will die.
174000	177000	We just haven't figured out who yet. Anyhow.
177000	179000	Also I feel kind of bad.
179000	180000	Why?
180000	182000	For crocheting when I'm sick.
182000	188000	Because I feel like whoever is going to get the scarf is going to get diseases like I'm a European settler.
188000	194000	You should feel bad for crocheting when we have so many things in the gaming world to talk about this week.
194000	196000	I can talk and crochet at the same time, Rob.
196000	200000	Actually it was kind of a slower news week. We'll get into that later.
200000	205000	But let me put it this way. Tonight we have Listless making a comeback tonight.
205000	209000	It has been forever since we played an OLR game. I was just realizing that earlier.
209000	211000	So we are bringing back Listless tonight.
212000	214000	Well you don't even know the topic yet.
214000	217000	I don't care. All of my answers are pie. Because of Alan.
217000	225000	I was going to say you got to try Alan's award winning pumpkin. It's not pumpkin pie. It's like pumpkin mousse dessert thing.
225000	228000	Chocolate chips and pumpkin. Chocolate and pumpkin.
228000	232000	He won first place at his work in the big bake off. And it's a big deal.
232000	235000	And he beat the reigning champion and it's not pretty.
235000	237000	I was fearing for his life actually.
238000	241000	I had to escort him to the parking lot to make sure he wouldn't get jumped.
241000	243000	Were you afraid of severe judgement?
243000	244000	Yes.
245000	247000	But everything was okay. So there you go.
247000	252000	Again, live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us.
252000	256000	And Dark Tetsuya pointing out there goes Loki talking out of turn again.
256000	258000	As he tends to do at the top of the show.
258000	262000	Technically not out of turn. She talked. I talked. I just talked sooner than you were expecting me.
262000	264000	It's not out of turn though.
264000	266000	And right now? Don't give a shit.
266000	268000	Surprise Loki. Surprise.
269000	275000	Alright, I don't have a lot of stuff to talk about before we get into our gaming weeks and the news tonight.
275000	278000	Did we actually give Loki a full introduction?
278000	279000	Yeah, you mentioned it.
279000	281000	Like, tech glasses.
281000	284000	Who is this guy? Who is this person that's talking?
284000	286000	I'm gonna flip the table in a second.
286000	289000	I have missed the 478 prior episodes of Orange Launch Radio.
289000	291000	Who is this guy? Seriously.
291000	293000	I'm taking back my Tootsie Rolls.
293000	297000	I can't figure it out based on the intro and the two people that have been introduced.
297000	300000	I just wish I could deduce who this was.
300000	302000	Let me go back. Let me go back for a minute here.
302000	304000	Let me listen to Midihead again here.
304000	308000	Bob. You know what? Shut. Stop it. I'm on drugs.
308000	310000	The show is called Orange Launch Radio.
310000	312000	I'm on drugs.
319000	321000	There he is.
321000	326000	You hush. You know what I was talking about. I will poke you in the eye with this needle.
330000	334000	Alright, for real though. I have a serious kickoff topic tonight. For real.
335000	341000	Like, okay, probably the most number, like the highest concentration of listeners for Orange Launch Radio is here in Northern California.
341000	345000	Because that's where we are. That's where a lot of the video games industry is.
345000	349000	So the highest concentration of Orange Launch Radio is in Northern California.
349000	354000	The second highest concentration of OLR listeners, I'm pretty sure, is New York City.
354000	361000	So obviously New York's going through a little bit right now with this whole, I don't know, some woman named Sandy is coming to blow everybody.
361000	363000	Cause she's, you're the one that she wants.
363000	364000	Sound like a porno.
364000	365000	Ooh, hoo, hoo.
365000	371000	In all seriousness, if you are in the path of that hurricane, I hope you've taken all those precautions to be safe.
371000	374000	If they've told you to evacuate, please turn off OLR.
374000	376000	We will be there on the podcast feed later.
376000	378000	And evacuate if that's what they've told you to do.
378000	385000	But if you have holed yourself up in the house with the walls all boarded up and you've got your liquor ready to go.
385000	390000	Like if DJ Rama's picture earlier was any indication.
390000	393000	Did you see the picture that Rama posted earlier of all his boos?
393000	396000	He had all his boos. He's like, I'm ready for the hurricane.
396000	401000	You know what, Rob? Think about New York City and think about trying to evacuate.
401000	402000	Not happening.
402000	404000	I know, right? Well, they closed the subway. They closed the schools.
405000	409000	By the time a hurricane hits up there, you know what it's gonna be?
409000	410000	A sneeze.
410000	411000	I hope you're right.
411000	413000	Well, cause you know last night-
413000	415000	I lose momentum inland.
415000	422000	Last night they were talking about this tsunami's gonna hit Hawaii and the tsunami's coming in and they had to evacuate the shores.
422000	424000	And then it ended up not really being a big deal.
424000	428000	Like you definitely didn't want to be in the water. It's not a time to surf. Like you could have really hurt yourself.
428000	430000	I'm more worried about Florida.
430000	433000	Yeah, well this thing isn't in the path of Florida, I don't think. Is it?
434000	436000	Is it that big of a hurricane?
436000	440000	Well, even a small hurricane is fairly big, Rob.
440000	447000	Well, no matter what. Look, we live in California. This isn't something we really have to deal with here. We have the earthquake thing instead.
447000	452000	But if you're in the path of this thing, I hope you're safe. That's what I really wanted to say.
452000	457000	Fill your bathtub full of water. Buy bleach. Get all the bread in the grocery store. And cans.
457000	459000	Ignorant California question. Ignorant California question.
459000	460000	What? What? What? What?
460000	462000	Why do you fill your bathtub with water?
462000	474000	Well, in case the water pipes break, or you get sewage backed up into the water, you have a tub, which is like what I think, I want to say seven gallons of fresh water.
474000	475000	Oh, so it's like your reserve water.
475000	477000	And you put like two drops of bleach in it to purify it.
477000	478000	Oh, okay.
478000	482000	So that way, even if the water lines are down, you have drinking water.
482000	485000	Okay, that makes sense. So you just need to have plenty of drinking water.
485000	487000	Yeah, and you know why you tape the windows, right?
487000	490000	Uh, that has to do with the pressure, right? So you don't get blow.
490000	494000	You don't get to if they actually break the table, hold it, and keep it from shattering.
494000	496000	Okay, yeah, that's what I figured. I knew it was something long.
496000	499000	It also stops the fog from coming in that turns people inside out.
502000	503000	Shut up.
503000	505000	That's a Simpsons reference.
505000	517000	Alright, anyhow, um, look, uh, I wanted to bring up this story because I had no idea that somebody was already waiting in line at Nintendo World for a Wii U.
518000	523000	Isaiah Triforce Johnson, I guess he changed his name to have Triforce in it.
523000	526000	He is a die-hard Nintendo fan to say the least.
526000	532000	I believe this is him last time with Reggie getting his Wii, so this guy is no stranger to camping out overnight.
532000	534000	Why does Reggie always look like a mannequin?
534000	536000	Because he's pretty.
536000	537000	Look at his eyes.
537000	540000	Because his body was ready for cybernetic enhancement.
540000	542000	He looks like he's a wax man.
542000	545000	He's perfectly groomed. He's a well-groomed man. There's nothing wrong with that.
545000	548000	He's gotta be a public figure for Nintendo. He can't look crazy.
548000	551000	Like if Doc Brown came up and like,
551000	552000	Hi, I'm Wii U!
552000	554000	His skin looks waxy.
554000	556000	Does he wax his face?
556000	557000	That might sell me a Wii U.
559000	561000	Well, anyway, look, the real story.
561000	571000	Mr. Triforce Johnson had to give up his spot in line because they basically said that the security at Rockefeller Center said you need to vacate by 6 p.m.
571000	573000	So he had to actually leave.
573000	582000	However, it has been promised that he may return to his place after Nintendo World reopens when the hurricane has passed.
582000	586000	So the hurricane has already caused at least one major disruption.
586000	590000	Oh, well, then we should just call this hurricane, Hurricane Common Sense.
590000	595000	Because who the fuck lines up for a Wii U a month before it comes out?
595000	598000	If this thing is disastrous, you are going to feel bad about making jokes about it.
598000	600000	No, I'm not going to feel bad. I feel no remorse.
601000	605000	No pity, and he will not stop until you are dead.
605000	607000	Wait, that was Terminator, sorry.
607000	615000	I can understand lining up a couple days ahead of time or the night of, but a month ahead of time?
615000	616000	He wanted to be the first.
616000	620000	May as well just stay in line for the next Nintendo system.
620000	624000	Alright, let's see, questions from our chat room.
624000	628000	Very important questions from chat at live.vognetwork.com.
629000	635000	Taiki asks, who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B? I think that's a Loki question.
635000	638000	Loki, who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B?
638000	642000	Well, Cliffy does have the youth going for him when he is a lot younger.
642000	646000	Reggie's kind of trollish, so it's hard to say.
646000	652000	But Reggie is probably much nicer in person, whereas Cliffy kind of comes off as a douche.
652000	656000	The thing about Cliffy, and I know this is exactly what you wanted to hear on a video game podcast this week.
656000	662000	The thing about Cliffy is he kind of has that male porn star hair going for him that's not doing him any favors.
662000	667000	Because straight men in porn, not always that exciting to look at.
667000	670000	And he's kind of got that hair going for it.
670000	672000	It's like some minus points.
672000	676000	But you're right, he does have that youth factor. He doesn't look waxy like Reggie.
676000	679000	Male porn stars always make me think of diseases.
681000	683000	Walking herpes.
684000	687000	WhatupG in chat says Nintendo should just send him a Wii U.
687000	691000	Do you think Mr. Triforce Johnson has earned the damn Wii U at this point?
693000	695000	Nintendo wants money.
697000	702000	Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat says Nintendo did say he will still be the first in line.
702000	705000	Which is good PR for Nintendo.
705000	707000	There you go.
707000	710000	I would have laughed if someone snuck in front of him before.
711000	714000	What, I was waiting here before you. You left.
715000	717000	Rama, run out there quick.
723000	725000	Alright, there you go.
725000	729000	Even though we're having fun with the subject and the story and everything.
729000	734000	First off, props to that guy for being so damn dedicated. You know what, props to you sir.
734000	740000	And second off, for real, we hope everybody is safe in this hurricane. Please be safe.
740000	742000	Don't be stupid.
742000	745000	No props to him for standing out there a month in advance.
745000	750000	He's actually on the payroll for Nintendo a little bit as well.
750000	751000	It's part of the problem.
751000	758000	He's done some events and stuff for Nintendo and actually covered stuff as a liaison for Nintendo.
758000	762000	I'm sorry, no. No props for this dude standing out a month in advance.
762000	765000	Yeah, cool. You're a dedicated Nintendo fan.
765000	768000	Yeah, you couldn't be up Reggie's ass a little bit more than you are.
768000	771000	So, I mean, cool that you're really excited.
772000	776000	If Reggie's ass is as waxy as the rest of him, then it should be as smooth as...
776000	779000	This is starting to go to a place I'm not okay with.
779000	780000	I'm just not...
780000	781000	Just throwing it out there.
781000	782000	I'm just...
783000	785000	It's just like those people that stand...
785000	789000	You know, I understand it's like, oh hey, it's fandom and stuff like that.
790000	792000	There's got to be a line to draw here, okay?
792000	795000	It'd be like me, well, I'm going to stand out in front of this building for a year
795000	798000	because I'm waiting for the next Xbox 360 or something.
798000	800000	People are going to be like, no, you're an idiot.
800000	803000	You should go stand in line for Breaking Dawn Part 2.
803000	804000	No.
805000	806000	No, I'm not.
806000	808000	You know someone is somewhere.
808000	809000	No, no one is.
809000	810000	Because you know why?
810000	811000	Because they don't have to do that anymore.
811000	815000	They have Fandango and places you can buy tickets online.
815000	821000	So that, you know, all those people are like, oh hey, I waited here for a couple days to get my tickets to Batman.
821000	825000	You're like, fuck you, I just spent two seconds and went online and got tickets for Batman.
825000	827000	Oh, who's the idiot now?
827000	832000	There are some movies where they do the midnight openings where they don't put them up on Fandango.
833000	834000	Alright, let's...
834000	838000	I, however, saw Frankenweenie opening night at Disneyland.
838000	839000	The end.
839000	840000	And trust me...
840000	841000	Well, can I touch you?
841000	842000	No.
842000	843000	I might catch gay.
843000	848000	Speaking of movies, speaking of movies, and I know we already had movies as a kickoff topic a couple weeks ago.
848000	849000	Are we going to see The Gift?
849000	855000	But I quickly want to say Silent Hill 3D Revelation. I did not see it yet. None of us did.
855000	862000	But I hear it is so bad. Like it's showgirls bad. Without the tits. Like it is really bad.
862000	864000	And that makes me want to see it more.
864000	865000	Rob, let's do this.
865000	866000	What?
866000	867000	Next week.
867000	868000	We need to see it at some point.
868000	869000	Just, you know.
869000	870000	Tomorrow night.
870000	872000	We'll have your people call my people and find a time.
872000	873000	Tomorrow night.
873000	874000	That actually probably will work.
874000	875000	Okay.
875000	878000	But I don't know. I've got to make sure the other half won't be mad I see it without them.
878000	882000	Well, I'll be going SNIFF SNORT.
882000	883000	Because I'll be sick.
883000	887000	And then, of course, this coming week, Wreck-It Ralph.
887000	889000	Which I know we've all been excited about.
889000	895000	One other thing I heard about that movie is that the flashlights, the shine from the flashlights are in 3D.
895000	896000	Oh boy.
896000	897000	I know, right?
897000	903000	Our buddy Mel, you know, Mel B, the classic DDR freestyler.
903000	907000	He, I don't know, he got some type of hookup or passes, won them, I don't know.
907000	909000	He got to already see Wreck-It Ralph.
909000	911000	And he gave it his stamp of approval.
911000	913000	And that's pretty important.
913000	915000	So we know that movie isn't going to completely suck.
915000	916000	So I'm excited about that.
916000	919000	The City Vampire, pointing out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
919000	924000	Silent Hill has a less than 10% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.
925000	927000	That's when you know it's like really bad.
927000	930000	It's not like 30% bad, it's less than 10% bad.
930000	932000	I actually liked the first one.
932000	933000	I did too.
933000	936000	I saw it four times in the theater, I own two copies of it.
936000	937000	Shit.
937000	939000	So I have to see this.
939000	940000	Alright.
940000	943000	Raginator in chat says, showgirls should be remade in 3D.
943000	945000	Nothing beats 3D boobs, right?
945000	950000	That may be true, but honestly, when it comes to showgirls, nothing beats going to the Castro theater
950000	954000	and watching a bunch of drag queens reenact the scene where she comes out of the volcano.
954000	956000	I'm so mad I missed it this year.
956000	959000	That's like your reason to live right there.
959000	964000	And if you want a close second into a possible showgirls in 3D,
964000	968000	you can just watch like, what is it, Piranha 3D.
968000	970000	That's true.
970000	971000	That's true.
971000	975000	I'm actually super upset that I missed showgirls this year.
975000	977000	There's always next year.
977000	979000	Next year we need a huge group.
980000	982000	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
982000	985000	Back to video games and what we have been playing this week.
985000	987000	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
987000	991000	Mass Effect, the first one, because my Mass Effect 3 still doesn't work.
991000	995000	I mean, I can kind of get it to run and I've gotten into multiplayer now,
995000	1001000	but it's like, it's just awful and they've escalated me again.
1001000	1003000	This will come up in the FUs.
1003000	1005000	And I've hardly played any WoW, actually.
1005000	1008000	You had like hella customer service EA stuff this week, didn't you?
1008000	1014000	I was on with two different customer service reps on their live chat for seven hours.
1014000	1016000	And one of the guys was super cool.
1016000	1019000	The other guy was, okay, okay, okay.
1019000	1023000	I have no problem with people from other countries.
1023000	1026000	I have a problem with them when they're outsourcing our jobs.
1026000	1030000	You know, when EA is sending a job and I know India's always picked on,
1030000	1033000	but it definitely was an Indian name.
1033000	1036000	And I was like, dude, no offense to you.
1036000	1042000	I want to speak to somebody in U.S. customer service who actually will listen to what I'm saying
1042000	1045000	and not just make assumptions about what I'm saying.
1045000	1049000	Because if you go back and read the log, you'll understand this has nothing to do with my DLC.
1049000	1051000	It has to do with the damn patch.
1051000	1056000	The thing about outsourced customer service in general, and it doesn't matter what country it's from,
1056000	1063000	even within the U.S. outsourcing sometimes, is that they usually are stuck to a script.
1063000	1066000	And if your inquiry or your question deviates from that script
1066000	1071000	and the things that they are very literally trained to handle, that's when you start to run into issues.
1071000	1079000	And unfortunately, what upper management fails to see a lot of the time is that most inquiries go off script.
1079000	1082000	I worked in customer service for how long?
1082000	1089000	The reason why I was good is because I stopped following my script because I knew what I was talking about.
1089000	1092000	And this has just gone on way too long.
1092000	1096000	And I finally, you know, they said, oh, we'll do the email service.
1096000	1102000	And they had me do a trace, which that I thought was a good idea to see if there was a connection problem on my end.
1102000	1105000	But I can tell you right when the problem started, it started with the last patch.
1105000	1111000	The patch did something because before that I had no problem.
1112000	1115000	So just so tired of it.
1115000	1123000	And and also just with I started getting I started with the sinus infection yesterday.
1123000	1128000	It was while I was out running errands. It's just I haven't really felt like playing much in the way of games.
1128000	1134000	And then when I got home, I was like, I want to play Mass Effect because I'm playing back through and doing all the stuff that
1134000	1136000	because the first time I just blew through the game.
1136000	1141000	And this time I'm I made Caden jealous, which was awesome.
1141000	1145000	And then I picked Liara over him. So he ran out in a snit.
1145000	1152000	And then I'm also though now I feel really dirty because, like, it's the equivalent of a 32 year old woman dating an 18 year old.
1152000	1159000	Because Liara is basically she's the equivalent mentally of an 18 year old.
1159000	1163000	It's dating a child. It does not work. It feels very wrong.
1163000	1166000	So, you know, these are all fake people, right?
1166000	1169000	I know Liara is blue. I know.
1169000	1174000	But OK, it's the point, though, of believability.
1174000	1179000	And what one because I mean, yeah, some people are really into dating children, I guess.
1179000	1182000	You know, I maybe it's just I'm spoiled by Garris.
1182000	1187000	I don't know. Acidic vampire in our chat room asks, have other people had the same problem with the patch?
1187000	1190000	Yes, I'm not the only one.
1190000	1199000	So it's been going on. And actually, people are now referencing my thing on the EA answer thing on BioWare's forums.
1199000	1206000	Several people have reposted it. A bunch of us have actually gone on to the Mass Effect Facebook page and linked it, which they've deleted.
1206000	1211000	Interesting. All right. Loki, let's move on to you. How was your gaming week?
1211000	1214000	I played Minecraft. It's pretty much it.
1214000	1220000	I mean, I was working on some stuff for that just on the roller coaster that I had there.
1220000	1229000	We added some more pixel art stuff in there, have a portion where it jumps into the mouth of a piranha plant, which is pretty sweet.
1229000	1235000	And then was a hit son was making.
1235000	1241000	He made a knight's was I remember the main character knight says, I guess knights would be knights.
1241000	1244000	Yes, made knights flying in the air. So that's kind of cool.
1244000	1248000	And we got the new patch this week.
1248000	1260000	So, you know, updated the server and been playing around command blocks, made some teleportation stations so we can, you know, hop to different parts of the map pretty quick.
1260000	1267000	And it's about it. Wish more people are on there because it's usually just me.
1267000	1271000	And then occasionally I'll see people pop in. But it's been pretty slow.
1271000	1274000	I know there's a lot of games out right now, so not surprising.
1274000	1279000	I was actually in the play some of those games, but I didn't know which one I wanted to play.
1279000	1286000	Got into that weird like gamer ADD stuff where I was like, ah, I can play Dishonored and start that game.
1286000	1290000	But I want to start another game because I'm already in the middle of Borderlands two.
1290000	1294000	And I don't know. It's just it's already beaten that game three times.
1294000	1300000	I'm sure he has. Oh, and then I guess I played Call of Duty a little bit. Modern Warfare 3.
1300000	1305000	Can't wait to play Black Ops 2. It'll be nice to switch up to something different.
1305000	1308000	But, yeah, that's pretty much it right now.
1308000	1317000	My gaming week, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, but I did decide I finally had it with Mass Effect 3 and Origin in general.
1317000	1321000	So I am done with the PC version of Mass Effect 3. I want nothing to do with it anymore.
1322000	1332000	So I went back to Xbox 360 version, which, although it kind of stinks that, you know, the controllers, it's harder to do with the controllers than the keyboard and mouse.
1332000	1338000	I got used to it pretty quick. And it is really sad that I really don't have connection problems on the 360 whatsoever.
1338000	1343000	I have none of those loading problems or delays or any of that shit that you get with Origin.
1343000	1350000	And it's so refreshing. And I had some characters unlocked on the 360 prior that I just really missed, like my Korean engineer.
1350000	1353000	So Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect. Lots of that.
1353000	1357000	Other games, though, besides Mass Effect, believe it or not. LittleBigPlanet Vita.
1357000	1363000	I played some more of that. I mentioned I touched this game a little bit last week, but I didn't really play a lot of it.
1363000	1368000	I got to play some more of it this week, and I'm overall pretty satisfied with it.
1368000	1373000	A lot of what I said last week still holds true. It's a lot of the good stuff from LittleBigPlanet 2.
1373000	1380000	However, I finally figured out why the game wasn't bugging me about the online connectivity when I was playing it last week.
1380000	1384000	Because the game has an online pass, and I hadn't put in the code yet.
1384000	1393000	And so when I finally, because, you know, you have to beat the entire first world before you unlock the moon and the community levels and all that.
1393000	1398000	So once I unlock that, it's like, oh, hey, you need an online pass. It's like you need to enter in the code from the manual.
1398000	1404000	And I'm like, there's no manual with LittleBigPlanet 2. And I started like, oh my god, did I get ripped off?
1404000	1412000	But I opened up the box, and there was a code there for, it said, the costumes from the Bioshock characters.
1412000	1417000	Like, it said, congratulations on your pre-order bonus for Big Daddy costume and all this stuff.
1417000	1422000	And I'm like, wait a minute, that's not an online code. And I'm like, I'm going to put it in anyway.
1422000	1426000	Sure enough, it was the online pass code. I put it in and it said, you've unlocked the online pass.
1426000	1432000	And I'm like, great. So if I didn't think to try that, I would have thought, they didn't send me one.
1432000	1440000	So, just a heads up, if you bought your copy of LittleBigPlanet Vita and all you have is a code for a costume, it might actually be your online pass code.
1440000	1443000	Just throwing it out there. So, there you go.
1443000	1451000	That was LittleBigPlanet Vita. I do like some of the enhancements they made to the online community stuff.
1451000	1456000	You can download levels now, so you don't have to, like, go connect and find them every time.
1456000	1462000	Some of the levels online are really stupid, though, but that's to be expected with any creation game.
1462000	1466000	You're only going to find a few gems in the haystack.
1466000	1472000	But, yeah, as far as execution, it is what you would expect on a little Vita screen.
1472000	1475000	And for that, it's pretty awesome, I gotta say.
1475000	1480000	Something else I played on the Vita. It's only a demo, and I don't like to review games based off the demo.
1480000	1488000	But after Shane's strong words last week about how he felt about Silent Hill Book of Memories, you know I had to go download the demo.
1488000	1494000	And so I played the entire demo, which was a good, I don't know, it was like the whole first level up through the boss.
1494000	1500000	I didn't hate it, but it's really not Silent Hill.
1500000	1506000	Like, it is a dungeon explorer crawler game with Silent Hill graphics stamped on it.
1506000	1515000	And so, like, if I were obsessed with the lore and really into the storytelling, as Shane was talking about on the call at the end of last week's show, I could see where that's offensive.
1515000	1522000	Like, having Valtiel be the quest giver at the beginning of the floor, some of that stuff's really hokey.
1522000	1532000	But I didn't hate it. I wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it, but I would totally rent the game for a weekend just to beat it, because I was kind of interested in where the story was going.
1533000	1542000	Because it was very like, you are the main character, and you're doing all these things, and I liked kind of the haunting memories that were playing on the TVs and all this stuff.
1542000	1552000	So, I was kind of into the story, so I didn't hate it as much as Shane did, but I get why people aren't into it, because it's not really Silent Hill.
1552000	1554000	I wouldn't play it after that description.
1554000	1558000	Yeah, I could bring it out here and show it to you, but you'd probably be like, eh.
1559000	1562000	I don't want to blow infected snot all over it.
1562000	1565000	All I had to do was look at the back cover and I was like, nope.
1565000	1571000	I don't think it's that bad, but it's not Silent Hill. That's really the best way I can describe it.
1571000	1576000	One other thing I'll quickly say, Smart Glass came out for Android devices.
1576000	1581000	So I'm sure many of you have checked out Microsoft Smart Glass, because it's on all the Android devices.
1581000	1585000	And here's where me having an iPhone and Alan having an Android device comes in handy.
1585000	1591000	So we got out his Galaxy 3 and downloaded Smart Glass to it, and I was playing around with the Xbox on it.
1592000	1595000	Eh. What's the big deal?
1595000	1599000	Nothing. It really doesn't do anything right now that the app didn't do before.
1599000	1603000	I seem to remember the existing app would allow you to control your Xbox.
1603000	1607000	How did you use it with Dance Central?
1607000	1614000	I did use it with Dance Central 3, and the only thing you can do so far, at least that I found out, to be fair, I gave it like two minutes.
1614000	1619000	But the only thing I figured you could do is queue up songs in party mode.
1619000	1625000	Alright, I guess that's cool. If I had eight people over, that would be kind of cool.
1625000	1632000	To be fair, that's all that Just Dance 4 kind of used the Wii U gamepad for.
1632000	1638000	Remember, that was one of their big things. Hey, you can queue up songs!
1639000	1643000	But, you know, it was just a big deal. I can swipe on the menu.
1643000	1649000	I'm almost positive the existing Xbox app that was out there would allow you to remote control your Xbox in the same way.
1649000	1652000	Like, I don't think that's new. I really don't.
1652000	1653000	Yes you can.
1653000	1657000	So, and then we're waiting for the TV and movie stuff, but none of that's in there yet.
1657000	1662000	So it's like, okay, they've got the framework for Smart Glass down, now let's see you use it!
1663000	1665000	Coming in 2013. Usefulness.
1666000	1670000	Well, it's just like, was it, um, the Xbox Vision Camera!
1670000	1675000	We've got the framework in place, now let's see the one, two games that are gonna use this.
1675000	1680000	Yes, you can make a user icon out of your face. That's about the most that vision camera's good for you.
1680000	1681000	That's all I really use that for.
1681000	1683000	Can you do, you can't do that with Kinect either, huh?
1683000	1684000	Yes you can.
1684000	1687000	Oh, can you? Well then, so much for the vision cam.
1687000	1689000	Yeah, it's obsolete.
1689000	1696000	Alright, uh, that's it for, uh, gaming week for me and for our other hosts.
1696000	1699000	Let's talk about housekeeping and then we'll get into the news this week.
1699000	1703000	Uh, housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.
1703000	1707000	Uh, follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1707000	1710000	We have an interview next week. We haven't had an interview in a while.
1710000	1713000	Uh, this one is for the old school listeners.
1713000	1718000	As you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a show about music-based video games
1718000	1724000	and for a long time we were pretty much exclusively about like the DDR and BeatMania and music game community.
1724000	1729000	So it's pretty surprising to me that in our ten and a half year history we've never had this guy on.
1729000	1734000	Uh, we may have had him on like for five minutes on one of the E3 specials
1734000	1740000	but we are going to properly have on the show next week, Eddie from BamaniStyle.com
1740000	1744000	is going to be on the show talking about what, you know,
1744000	1749000	especially because we have a news story tonight about like DDR's reboot and all this stuff
1749000	1750000	and I'm not going to spoil too much about that.
1750000	1755000	But we really want to get his thoughts on kind of where the music game community is going
1755000	1760000	because I'll tell you this, Eddie obviously has a lot of love for the Bamani community
1760000	1765000	and a lot of the stuff that he did was a lot of the stuff that many of us dreamed about.
1765000	1770000	He had the Uber website. He started this record label thing or this record distribution thing
1770000	1772000	where he was shipping out a lot of the music.
1772000	1775000	He got some of these artists to come to ASEN.
1775000	1779000	He's really been intimately involved with a lot of the music gaming like today.
1779000	1784000	So getting to pick his brain on a lot of like music gaming and his thoughts is going to be a lot of fun.
1784000	1787000	So this is going to be a fun episode next week.
1787000	1790000	Eddie from BamaniStyle.com will be here.
1790000	1792000	Sounds super.
1792000	1794000	I know. And it's live. So you guys will be able to ask him questions.
1794000	1798000	So make sure you're here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1798000	1802000	That is next week, November 4th, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
1802000	1806000	All right. I think that's all I have for housekeeping. Yeah.
1806000	1810000	All right. Let's get into the news tonight. Loki, start us off.
1810000	1816000	So G4 has finally canceled the last two bits of the old G4,
1816000	1819000	which would be X-Play and Attack of the Show.
1819000	1826000	And even Attack of the Show is not that old, but, you know, last bit of gaming, I guess, to the network.
1826000	1829000	And they will basically run until the end of this year.
1829000	1836000	And then they're going to have kind of a look back at the best of and then their final episodes and that's it.
1836000	1841000	And then G4 has will be wiping itself of gaming, I guess.
1841000	1847000	And apparently the rumor is that the channels was this shift towards like a guy network.
1847000	1854000	They're saying it's like Esquire or GQ channel, which sounds very boring, but cool.
1854000	1860000	I wonder where Cheaters reruns and Cops reruns fit into that, but we'll see.
1862000	1867000	Well, to the news that these shows are leaving, this is all I have to say on the matter.
1875000	1877000	And that's all, folks.
1880000	1883000	I like the scream. The scream really does it for me.
1884000	1887000	That was a really good particular Bugs Bunny ending, wasn't it?
1887000	1890000	It's sad, but it's not like we all didn't see this coming.
1894000	1897000	It was the merger that was the beginning of the end.
1897000	1901000	I was going to say, without sounding like a heartless bitch, it's really not sad either, I'm sorry.
1901000	1907000	But, I mean, the biggest talents behind these shows both already abandoned ship.
1907000	1911000	Sessler left X-Play and Kevin Pereira left Attack of the Show.
1911000	1918000	And I'm sorry, that show was already done for me the minute they started calling it Attack of the Show and it was no longer the screen savers.
1918000	1921000	I mean, that's when that show was already over.
1921000	1926000	And X-Play was good when it was on Tech TV, when it was called Extended Play.
1926000	1932000	I miss Tech TV so much. It's just like, that was the most awesome network ever.
1932000	1936000	And then it's like, hey, G4 sounds pretty cool.
1936000	1939000	And then they mixed them together and it's like, whoa, this is like the best thing ever.
1939000	1944000	And it went so downhill from there. It's just like, I don't even understand how that's possible, but...
1944000	1949000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, AcidicVampire in our chat says,
1949000	1953000	Oh, I thought you were going to play a RuPaul sashay away clip.
1953000	1956000	I wish I'd thought of that. Next time, next time.
1956000	1962000	The SEG in our chat room says, man, I wonder what the people who have G4 tattooed on them think.
1965000	1968000	I forgot about that. They were doing that on E3, weren't they?
1968000	1969000	I don't know.
1969000	1971000	I'm pretty sure they were at one point.
1971000	1974000	They're like, they better pay for the removal.
1974000	1980000	Well, look, and here's the thing, especially judging off the Twitter reaction and all this stuff this week,
1980000	1986000	like people were like, I'm so sad that these shows are leaving and man, G4, there's no video game thing on anymore.
1986000	1989000	And all this stuff. And I'm like, you guys are...
1989000	1993000	People still have their same presence at E3.
1993000	2000000	You guys are remembering these shows from three years ago back when you were actually watching them.
2000000	2006000	If you all were actually watching them, this news would not be coming because it's all about ratings.
2006000	2008000	If they hadn't changed them, people would have been watching them.
2008000	2011000	Oh my God, the new guy on X-Play was fucking annoying.
2011000	2013000	I don't... See, I don't even...
2013000	2019000	I watched the clip. They had a clip of something. I don't even remember what it was about, but it was fucking annoying.
2019000	2022000	The guy was a total asshat.
2022000	2029000	Raginator in chat says, personally, I love the shows. Those shows were the reason I subscribed to cable in 2008.
2029000	2032000	A lot of people kind of reminiscing on the older G4 stuff.
2032000	2038000	And yeah, you know, it's unfortunate, but the network was already over several years ago.
2038000	2043000	Remember when they started showing reruns of Cops? Hello. I mean, come on.
2043000	2047000	The first downfall was the murder.
2048000	2055000	And I want to really know where the financial status was that made the merger necessary.
2055000	2060000	Well, according to Black Wolf in our chat room, and he was pretty intimately involved in the early days of G4,
2060000	2066000	and he talks about that on his own show, but Bobby's in chat and says, Paul Allen got tired of tech TV.
2066000	2071000	That's why he sold it to Comcast, even though they were about to have positive ratings for the first time.
2071000	2074000	So somebody just threw their hands up and said, I'm kind of over it.
2075000	2077000	I'm curious. A lot of people talking about the E3 coverage.
2077000	2082000	You know, for some people, that's all G4 is now, is E3 coverage,
2082000	2085000	because they have done the live stuff from the show floor and so on.
2085000	2089000	So does that mean the tiara goes to Spike TV by default?
2089000	2093000	They've already been doing that. Spike TV was live streaming all the coverage through game trailers,
2093000	2094000	their partnership with game trailers.
2094000	2098000	Weren't they like across the street? Oh, okay. They were actually in the...
2098000	2101000	Yeah, they were doing all of the press conferences.
2101000	2109000	So Spike had a thing going already. Lately, they've been more of a gaming network than G4 was.
2109000	2113000	G4 kind of tried to branch out a bit of like trying to do the whole geek thing,
2113000	2117000	and like, you know, oh, hey, here's some quirky stuff about movies,
2117000	2121000	and it was just, it wasn't working. I don't know.
2121000	2128000	But I think Spike's all right. They've got, and it's kind of funny,
2128000	2131000	you know, if they're going to be shifting to this like kind of guy channel thing,
2131000	2136000	that's kind of what Spike's already doing right now, sort of.
2136000	2139000	I mean, they're not really doing the GQ stuff.
2139000	2146000	They're kind of taking more of the lowbrow route to that kind of, you know,
2146000	2150000	shows with big-titted women and, you know, stuff like that.
2150000	2154000	You know, Thousand Ways to Die or action movies.
2154000	2158000	The thing that I found surprising, however, amongst all this,
2158000	2160000	is that with the cancellation of these two shows,
2160000	2167000	that means there is one show on all of television cable that is about video games,
2167000	2170000	and it's that show that Jeff Keighley has on Spike TV where, you know,
2170000	2172000	have some Doritos and Mountain Dew with your game trailers TV.
2172000	2176000	Yes, exactly. You have some Doritos and Mountain Dew with your game trailers.
2176000	2180000	But it kind of surprised me because, you know,
2180000	2186000	I thought video games were supposed to be like the modern version of movies or music,
2186000	2187000	you know, some new art form.
2187000	2191000	And we have tons of shows about movies and TV shows and music.
2191000	2194000	Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood.
2194000	2196000	Who watches Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood?
2196000	2197000	Old people.
2197000	2198000	People that are old.
2198000	2199000	Grandma.
2199000	2204000	That don't know how to use the internet or just don't care to watch the internet.
2204000	2207000	But not to say that that's necessarily a bad thing.
2207000	2209000	And they could have shows like that because, I mean, hell,
2209000	2213000	there's people that work that have locked down internet at work
2213000	2216000	or they're working like some place that doesn't have internet
2216000	2219000	or that's open and they can look at this stuff.
2219000	2222000	And then they can get kind of like a quick feed of, you know,
2222000	2225000	what's coming out and, you know, what the news is and stuff.
2225000	2228000	But unfortunately, the gaming demographic,
2228000	2232000	a lot of those people are just like internet crazy.
2232000	2236000	And so the news travels a lot faster on the internet
2236000	2239000	than obviously these shows can pick up on.
2239000	2241000	But it doesn't mean that they can fail.
2241000	2244000	I mean, a lot of these shows, if they have,
2244000	2247000	and this is kind of the whole thing with game trailers, TV is,
2247000	2250000	they make a lot of news because they get a lot of exclusive interviews
2250000	2252000	and exclusive trailers and stuff like that.
2252000	2254000	You're like you're going to see it first on that show
2254000	2256000	before you, you know, see it on the internet.
2256000	2259000	That's where the key is to running a successful kind of
2259000	2262000	entertainment business, at least as far gaming stuff.
2262000	2265000	I mean, look at Game Informer, same thing there.
2265000	2268000	That's how they were able to kind of, other than, you know,
2268000	2273000	coming free with, you know, subscribing to GameStop's card.
2273000	2275000	But a lot of their stuff is, you know,
2275000	2278000	they leverage these interviews and exclusives and stuff.
2278000	2280000	And so they're the kind of the source of news.
2280000	2283000	And I also have to say their magazine actually is pretty well designed.
2283000	2286000	Let me go to the chat room because of course we are the show
2286000	2287000	where every gamer has a voice.
2287000	2289000	And sometimes those voices want to, you know,
2289000	2292000	set us on a different path here at live.vognetwork.com.
2292000	2294000	Black Wolf wants to point out that Electric Playground
2294000	2296000	and Judgment Day are still around.
2296000	2298000	You might know Judgment Day as reviews on the run.
2298000	2301000	Electric Playground is in syndication.
2301000	2304000	A lot of ABC affiliates on the weekends right now.
2304000	2308000	So I guess for me to say that Game Trailers TV is the only video game show
2308000	2310000	left on all of television is a falsity.
2310000	2312000	So sorry for that.
2312000	2315000	I guess you could say on all cable because syndication doesn't really hit cable.
2315000	2318000	What would syndicated Electric Playground have anything to offer?
2318000	2321000	Like I don't really give a shit about a review of Halo 2 or something like that.
2321000	2325000	Well, I would say it's the equivalent of Ebert and Roper.
2325000	2327000	Although I don't even think that exists anymore.
2327000	2329000	But at the movies or whatever they call that.
2329000	2330000	You know, what's the point of that show?
2330000	2332000	It's reviews on movies.
2332000	2334000	So why not have a show that's review on games?
2334000	2335000	I get it.
2335000	2338000	I don't think it's any different than the Roper or Ebert stuff
2338000	2339000	from five years ago.
2339000	2343000	So that's the niche it's filling I assume.
2343000	2346000	TigerConChat says, old people watch those shows.
2346000	2352000	Young people, they watch things like TMZ.com for all the entertainment news and gossip.
2352000	2355000	TMZ is kind of trash though.
2355000	2356000	You know what I do?
2356000	2358000	I look at your Facebook.
2358000	2360000	Here's what I want to know.
2360000	2361000	What's happening to...
2361000	2364000	Oh, Black Wolf thinks...
2364000	2366000	Oh, I didn't get this.
2366000	2370000	Black Wolf thinks that you missed the point that these are new episodes.
2370000	2373000	These are not syndicated old stuff from G4.
2373000	2375000	These are new episodes.
2375000	2379000	But it's like Baywatch was a syndicated show when it was new and all that.
2379000	2380000	So these are new things.
2380000	2381000	Sorry about that.
2381000	2382000	I didn't catch that.
2382000	2383000	I thought you meant to say Halo 4.
2383000	2384000	Well, if it's new stuff, then that's alright.
2384000	2386000	Yeah, it's new stuff.
2386000	2388000	I remember watching Electric Playground.
2388000	2390000	Tommy Tallarico is still doing that stuff?
2390000	2391000	I believe so.
2391000	2392000	I think it's still him and that other guy.
2392000	2394000	Victor... Victor...
2394000	2395000	They're kind of annoying.
2395000	2397000	But I do respect Tommy Tallarico.
2397000	2399000	But yeah, one of them was really annoying.
2399000	2400000	I just can't remember who.
2400000	2402000	I don't think it was Tommy Tallarico.
2402000	2404000	Well, you know, but then the same thing.
2404000	2407000	Some people think Ebert was annoying or Roper.
2407000	2408000	I don't know.
2408000	2410000	I'm sure a lot of people think I'm annoying.
2410000	2412000	Yeah, that's right.
2414000	2415000	Let's see.
2415000	2417000	What else is going to bring up?
2417000	2419000	Oh, the TMZ.com bit.
2419000	2422000	TMZ is kind of a trash thing, though.
2422000	2423000	I mean, let's be real.
2423000	2425000	All TMZ runs is trash.
2425000	2428000	And it's the type of stuff that, you know, gets posted on Facebook.
2428000	2431000	Like, oh my God, Lindsay Lohan with the intervention.
2431000	2432000	Da da da da da da.
2432000	2433000	I'm surprised.
2433000	2434000	Real quick.
2434000	2435000	What?
2435000	2438000	What the fuck is up with her playing Liz Taylor?
2440000	2445000	I was just about to ask, so where is our trashy gossip site about video games?
2445000	2447000	Who is the Perez Hilton of video games?
2447000	2450000	But then Jamie has to go and open her mouth and say that.
2450000	2452000	So I'm thinking maybe it's us.
2453000	2454000	We just saw Victoria post about it.
2454000	2456000	We can be your trashy gossip site.
2456000	2457000	It made me cry.
2457000	2461000	There's just not enough gossip in the game industry.
2461000	2465000	It's just, you know, we can make up speculative rumors about things,
2465000	2469000	but I don't think there's really anything like that.
2470000	2473000	No one cares about, like, gossip.
2475000	2476000	Just they like rumors.
2476000	2477000	What are you talking about?
2477000	2480000	Nobody in video games cares about gossip.
2480000	2481000	Are you high?
2481000	2484000	That is all people ever talk about is gossip.
2484000	2486000	No, they talk about rumors.
2486000	2487000	Okay, that's the same thing.
2487000	2489000	Where did Cliffy B go?
2489000	2490000	That's gossip.
2490000	2492000	Cliffy B went to Nintendo.
2492000	2493000	I have a friend who's on-
2493000	2495000	Cliffy B went to go bang his wife, okay?
2495000	2496000	That's where he went.
2496000	2504000	The Wii U is causing all this turmoil within Nintendo and blah blah blah blah.
2504000	2505000	That's gossip.
2505000	2507000	What do you mean the video game?
2507000	2511000	The video game press thrives on gossip.
2511000	2513000	Yeah, but it's not like celebrity gossip.
2513000	2517000	I mean, I'm saying that you can't, there's not as much content out there for,
2517000	2521000	I mean, celebrity gossip, there's people stalking every celebrity out there.
2521000	2524000	Someone's gonna fuck up, you know, once a day or at least once an hour.
2524000	2528000	So are you saying that there's no celebrity in the video games industry?
2528000	2529000	Not big enough.
2529000	2534000	So why did we just talk about how Reggie Fils-Aime looks like a wax figure?
2534000	2538000	There is two celebrities within video games, absolutely.
2538000	2542000	So let's start stalking him and find out how Reggie Fils-Aime double parked today.
2542000	2543000	Woo hoo!
2543000	2550000	No, there's a difference between the A-list of standard celebrity, you know what I mean?
2550000	2555000	And then there's a difference between the A-list of geek celebrity,
2555000	2563000	where we might care more about, like, say, what Wil Wheaton put on his blog,
2563000	2565000	because honestly, he's a really good blogger.
2565000	2569000	How many of us can really give a shit about Lindsay Lohan?
2569000	2571000	I'm not raising my hand.
2571000	2575000	She was in Mean Girls, and that is one of the best movies ever.
2575000	2582000	But my point, you know, who cares how many more kids, you know, Brangelina adopted?
2582000	2584000	Don't give a shit. They can afford it good.
2584000	2586000	Let them raise all those damn children.
2586000	2587000	Don't care.
2587000	2594000	But I do care, you know, if, oh, well, so-and-so developer left whatever, you know, company,
2594000	2598000	and that means no more of this, or he's gonna be, that's shit we care about.
2599000	2602000	You know, and that, and we do care about D-list celebrities like Kathy Griffin.
2602000	2605000	I think you're right, though, about the nerd celebrity thing.
2605000	2609000	Like, and I'm reminded yesterday, this is a big deal for Understation Live.
2609000	2616000	Jessica from Understation Live, Iguana girl, she got her question read by Felicia Day in some live chat,
2616000	2621000	and basically had this reaction, you know, because, you know, Felicia Day is pretty cool.
2621000	2624000	And like, even, you know, the geeks on her friends list were all going,
2624000	2628000	but you know there's people on her friends list that aren't in the whole geeks culture.
2628000	2630000	Look at that and go, who?
2630000	2636000	Well, you know, I've met some famous people before, and I was just like, oh, hi, how's it going?
2636000	2641000	And I completely geeked out when Wil Wheaton answered a question on Twitter.
2641000	2647000	I completely geeked out when I met wrestlers back when I was into wrestling.
2647000	2653000	And I had my moment earlier this year because I told everybody I knew that I got to shake Latrice Royale's hand,
2653000	2659000	and like, you know, I met Latrice Royale and she was gorgeous and all that, and everybody's like, who?
2659000	2663000	And I'm like, it's a drag queen, hang my head in shame.
2663000	2671000	Or my autograph from Kondo Koji or the other Koji, Igarashi.
2671000	2674000	Remember the picture that you took of me with him at E3?
2674000	2675000	I do.
2675000	2683000	I was like, and first of all, he was pretty floored that my horrible Japanese came across, you know, understandably,
2683000	2688000	but still it was, it was, and you know, running into Kojima three years in a row, literally.
2688000	2694000	Stan in our chat room says everybody's, or excuse me, everyone's idea of a celebrity is different.
2694000	2698000	That's a very, that's a very good point because I really got to address this topic carefully
2698000	2701000	because I really don't want to sound like I have ego.
2701000	2708000	But I was very humbled and thankful that when I went to PAX East a couple of years ago, I did have people that like came up to me.
2708000	2713000	And like, I had like a group of people that just came up to me and was like, are you Rob?
2713000	2715000	You're Rob from Los Angeles, aren't you?
2715000	2717000	And I was like, oh yeah, I am. Hi, you know.
2717000	2722000	There was some random guy at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza, you know, who wanted to talk to us.
2722000	2729000	Which is, and I was like, oh my God, that's like, it was like as much of an OMG moment for me as it was for you, I'm sure.
2729000	2733000	Or it's like, you know, I'm like, oh, people like actually do listen to this show.
2733000	2737000	It's kind of a humbling moment. It's pretty awesome.
2737000	2745000	So anyhow, Stan in chat says I made Latrice Royale in PlayStation Home.
2745000	2748000	Got a lot of weird looks. Actually, you should just tell him to eat it.
2748000	2753000	I'll tell you when it was Miss Freaky for me was when I went to Alabama a few years ago.
2753000	2759000	And they were doing attorney in Biloxi. I think it was in Biloxi.
2759000	2763000	No, it was. It was. Yeah, I think it was in Biloxi.
2763000	2769000	But anyway, I showed up for some DDR tournament on a fifth mix machine.
2769000	2773000	And because it was their new fifth mix, they were all happy and we'd had it for a while.
2773000	2777000	But, you know, it was all cool. And they're like, you're here.
2777000	2780000	You said you'd be here and you're here. And I was like, hi, everybody.
2780000	2790000	Nice to me. And then I went to like some 2DX party on a widescreen TV and had to play Karaoke Revolution.
2790000	2801000	And it was pretty fun. But I mean, it's at the same time, though, it's I prefer it more when it leads to making friends with people.
2801000	2807000	No one cares about. I'm sorry, Loki. But you're a shut in, too. You don't go out as much as Jamie and I do.
2807000	2814000	True. You know what? Our listeners are my kind of people. Most everybody else in the universe.
2814000	2819000	I'm like, don't touch don't don't touch me. Don't talk to me. Our listeners.
2819000	2823000	I'm like, OK, you're allowed to touch me on the arm. All right.
2823000	2829000	Dave Falcon in our chat room says, I met the nature boy, Rick Flair, in a bathroom in a bar in Tampa.
2829000	2833000	And I asked him for his autograph. I hope he didn't do that when he was paying, because that's a little awkward.
2833000	2842000	Like there's there's time to talk to people. Sign it with your urine. I have his DNA.
2842000	2847000	That reminds me of this scene from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, about Abba. Never mind. Never mind.
2847000	2856000	Let's move on with the news. The ESRB, the entertainment rating board, entertainment software rating board.
2856000	2868000	They are trying to streamline the release of downloadable games, doing a new rating service that is targeted for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, eShop, WiiWare and Windows 8.
2868000	2879000	This service is no cost. So that's a big like, oh, incentive for people to use this, because, you know, there's a lot of indie developers and people that don't have very big budgets making games for these platforms.
2879000	2888000	So this is a no cost service. What the deal is, you do an online questionnaire and through this questionnaire, you basically self identify the adult content.
2888000	2895000	What's interesting about this, the questionnaire will also rate a game in terms of what is shared.
2895000	2906000	So there's some new content descriptors in the game that will indicate that the game shares information, shares location or interacts with users.
2907000	2916000	That's pretty awesome. I've got to say, actually, I love this idea. Even it's like me. I love the fact that I will know exactly which games are going to want to share my location.
2916000	2921000	Can we see that those ratings on Facebook? I with what they're sharing.
2921000	2927000	I don't see why it wouldn't work if Facebook games were willing to put it on their Facebook, the website.
2927000	2935000	Oh, yeah, we should rate Facebook, the website. But that's that's another rating sport that will have to do that.
2935000	2941000	Apparently, this is very similar to what PlayStation mobile games already have going forward on the rating system.
2941000	2946000	Some are saying that could have been inspired by that. So very cool.
2946000	2950000	I love that it's no cost. Let's just hope everybody's honest in those questionnaires.
2950000	2957000	I'm almost positive there will be a story in the near future about a game that is missing one of these labels that should have had it.
2957000	2963000	But we'll see. It's an interesting step forward for now. So I can't see how this is a bad idea.
2963000	2969000	Looking forward to it. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us? It's new.
2969000	2981000	You know what that means? More Bimani. So, yeah, Konami has announced that the newest DDR game is just called Dance Dance Revolution.
2981000	2988000	And they haven't put a whole bunch of details about it, but they're doing their first location test at Tokyo Leisure Land.
2989000	2994000	Is that next Friday? I think it is. It's already already happened. Yeah.
2994000	3001000	So, yeah, there's a location test page and everything up now, but is it supposed to do all of its updates of the Internet?
3001000	3006000	Yes, some of the tweets were indicating that like that.
3006000	3012000	I guess they're calling it Dance Dance Revolution because they're not envisioning that there will ever be a second mix or a third mix.
3012000	3016000	There's just going to be one mix that can be constantly updated. Yeah.
3016000	3022000	Actually, there's a quote on here from So In Love about future DDR series.
3022000	3031000	I talked with Uson and they named this version as just DDR because they will update it, but no new versions.
3031000	3036000	And I think that's an Engrish-y post, but still. So they say now.
3036000	3043000	Well, you guys were all longtime DDR fans. That's the game that brought us together.
3043000	3048000	So obviously, I'm sure we all have opinions on this. Loki, what do you think about a new DDR?
3048000	3055000	I think it's stupid. And I mean, they tried the same thing with the console version and we saw how well that worked out.
3055000	3059000	It tanked and they said, oh, but we're going to provide lots of DLC for it.
3059000	3063000	They provide some DLC and then it's done. Nothing.
3063000	3068000	You get the game dirt cheap now and there's no DLC support for it.
3068000	3073000	So, yeah, I see that totally happening with this where they're going to have some DLC for it.
3073000	3078000	And here's what I want to know is if they're going to constantly update this game, then how are they going to sell new games?
3078000	3083000	They just don't want to make profit off it anymore or they're going to sell DLC to arcades.
3083000	3089000	So you're gonna have some arcades that have these extra songs and some arcades that don't have these extra songs or.
3089000	3092000	I think that's how it would have to work, a selling DLC to the arcade.
3092000	3097000	I kind of think it's a great idea. But remember, this is Japan. This is not something that's being tested here.
3097000	3104000	This is a very Japanese centric thing. And for a Japanese arcade where you have karaoke boos that, you know, have their own songs and what have you.
3104000	3108000	I could actually see this really working. And yes, I think it would give arcades some identity.
3108000	3114000	They tried it with Tekken, I want to say, was one of the games that they're going to have DLC for that arcades are going to pay for or something like that.
3114000	3125000	The problem is, though, is like it was so they basically kind of excludes all of the other territories other than Japan because a lot of these can't connect to emus.
3125000	3133000	So they're going to be stuck with basically the default song list, which may not be a bad thing, but it's just kind of what's the incentive?
3133000	3142000	You put out things that aren't specifically Japan licensed for that first release, but all the DLC will have Japan only licenses.
3142000	3145000	You know, that's what I see happening.
3145000	3149000	Jamie, what do you think about a reboot of DDR?
3149000	3155000	Why not? I mean, really, I'm kind of like, but I'll play it.
3155000	3160000	I mean, I always play the new stuff when it comes out, but I kind of hit a point where I stopped caring.
3161000	3163000	I'm good for them. I hope it works.
3163000	3167000	Let's be honest. They've rebooted DDR like four or five times already.
3167000	3171000	I honestly think Konami doesn't understand what makes DDR good.
3171000	3175000	And so, you know, with Extreme, they remember we're starting all over again.
3175000	3179000	And then they had Supernova, and that was kind of another reboot.
3179000	3181000	And then they have the X series, which is kind of a reboot.
3181000	3184000	They did three games into that, and now they're rebooting it again.
3184000	3188000	I mean, it's like, do you guys not know what fucking makes these games good?
3188000	3196000	Is that it? You're just kind of like, well, we're just going to draw straws here until we figure out why this is selling, you know, or why people are playing it or not playing it.
3196000	3201000	They had a strong formula for a while, and people were excited, and then they changed it.
3201000	3210000	Which I think that that might have been, you know, because, I mean, keep in mind, how long have the guitar freaks in Dramania still been going on?
3210000	3215000	How popular is pop and music still? Pop and music is way popular.
3215000	3222000	And just because they've kept their formula. They haven't kept trying to redesign it. They haven't tried to reinvent it.
3222000	3231000	And that's what I think the problem they're doing with DDR is that they've gotten away from, they're trying to make it edgy, trying to keep it new, but really it's that quirky classic that people like.
3231000	3240000	I'm kind of with Jamie on this. I'm like, you know, and I've said this for years when we were mostly music-based, is I said, you know, DDR really does need to reinvent itself.
3240000	3250000	And I don't think any of these other, I don't think Supernova or X really were a reinvention whatsoever. None of it really did anything to push the franchise forward.
3250000	3259000	So I'm a little bit hopeful that if they have to go back and put in this infrastructure to support DLC for arcades and all that, maybe they're going to approach other ideas for the game as well.
3259000	3263000	Like something to make it a little more competitive or some of this new stuff.
3263000	3274000	I mean, I think a creative reboot would be a great idea, but I don't know if that's really what we're getting with this game, but kind of like Jamie's saying with her point, it's better than nothing.
3274000	3277000	I'm like, well, sure. Why not? What the hell?
3277000	3287000	But this whole stance of like, well, we just don't see it. We don't see us making another DDR game. So you're giving up is what you're saying is where you're going to support it with songs.
3287000	3297000	And if people are interested in the songs and cool, you'll keep releasing them. But let's put it this way. If they're not charging for that DLC, then what's the real incentive for them to do it anyways?
3297000	3303000	I mean, because they're not helping themselves. I mean, they're not going to sell any more games.
3304000	3314000	If they are charging for DLC, then it all comes down to how much is this stuff costing? Because obviously in an arcade machine, we're not talking like $5 song DLC.
3314000	3319000	We're talking probably like, you know, a couple hundred dollars or, you know, whatever for these songs.
3319000	3329000	And if arcade owners back there, you know, if that's going to be worth it to them, because adding a few songs to machine might not necessarily get more people playing.
3329000	3339000	I mean, sure. It'll be like, oh, hey, there's new songs unlocked. That was kind of the case with Max 2 and Max and stuff where it's like, oh, man, we unlocked a new song. Let's come on down, play this new song. It was really cool.
3339000	3349000	And it kind of got people wanting to play it because they're working towards unlocking something. And now the way they have it is where it's just like, oh, you get a code and it unlocks something.
3349000	3357000	And then now, you know, it's basically all on this stuff. And then now they're going to have this instead of it being a code, they're going to push an update.
3357000	3372000	This is sort of what I was talking about a lot earlier with Tekken 3. Because people, when Tekken 3 came out, I worked at a Namco arcade and we had people always coming in saying, how many more matches until we unlock somebody?
3372000	3381000	You know, even though I think they were all on a date cycle, you know, who's the next person? Well, in Japan, they got this person. We must be different here, which they ended up being different.
3381000	3394000	And, you know, that worked for DDR where you would unlock things. And I really wish that they would go back to something like that. I mean, if they're going to do DLC updates, it just still be unlockable stuff.
3394000	3402000	You know, to keep that excitement, to keep people feeling like there's a sense of achievement that it's a community wide effort.
3402000	3419000	That was always the best part about Max 2 was that community part. So I'm all for that. I will withhold judgment until I actually get to play it, which may not be anytime soon if recent DDR releases are any sign, but I hope for the best.
3419000	3424000	What else can I say? Let's move on with news. Loki.
3424000	3434000	Yeah. So let's see. Let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And honestly, this news doesn't surprise me at all.
3434000	3446000	So the rumor is that the Wii U is not going to launch with all the features on the system. Kind of sound a little familiar with Nintendo's kind of M.O.
3446000	3465000	Apparently they're seeing right now that the features, including Miiverse and the near field communication, that they won't be on the actual system. You're going to have to download Miiverse in order to actually have it, which kind of seems a little odd to me.
3465000	3468000	Wasn't that supposed to be what you see when you turn on your Wii U?
3468000	3469000	Yeah.
3469000	3473000	That's weird.
3473000	3482000	And I guess, you know, obviously later on, they're going to add some other support and stuff for multiple game pads and that kind of thing, which makes no sense right now because no games use it.
3482000	3489000	But and even the near field communication stuff doesn't really make any sense to have that right now because nothing uses it.
3489000	3498000	But Miiverse is a little weird that that wouldn't be on the actual console because I don't know.
3498000	3508000	They're saying that it won't be it's possible that it won't be available at launch because considering third parties can't access it right now.
3508000	3512000	So hold on. Let me let me get this straight.
3512000	3513000	How are they going to have any games incorporated?
3513000	3515000	Exactly. Let me get this straight here.
3515000	3521000	So they have this thing that's supposed to tie into these games, but no games can tie into it.
3521000	3525000	In fact, it's kind of funny if that's true, because third party games can access it.
3525000	3530000	The one of the big games that they showed this whole Miiverse thing was with Zombie U.
3530000	3535000	So that was all bullshit that they were kind of pushing our way.
3535000	3539000	I mean, I don't know.
3539000	3546000	I think it's kind of retarded that you have a Nintendo system launch without like all the features in there.
3546000	3547000	Like, remember the 3DS?
3547000	3548000	Where was the Web browser?
3548000	3550000	Oh, it didn't come out until months after.
3550000	3552000	It's like, what?
3552000	3558000	I mean, you're selling me this broken piece of shit that you're going to patch in the stuff later on.
3558000	3563000	Why don't you delay the release a little bit and have some actual, you know, have it done?
3563000	3566000	Why bother pushing this out when stuff isn't done yet?
3566000	3567000	Or I don't know.
3567000	3571000	This is a main feature of the console and you haven't fucking finished it yet.
3571000	3575000	It's not that complicated of a piece of software.
3575000	3577000	But it is all rumor.
3577000	3578000	It's all rumor.
3578000	3584000	I mean, Miiverse could be also one of those things that they're going to, quote unquote, patch in day one.
3584000	3587000	Like, it could be one of those things that they're really working right up to the last minute.
3587000	3590000	I mean, I'm totally theorizing just throwing it out there.
3590000	3595000	Miiverse is one thing, but the other stuff you're talking about?
3595000	3597000	Okay, near field communication.
3597000	3598000	Big deal if that's not there.
3598000	3600000	The whole dual Wii U.
3600000	3602000	No, that I don't expect to be.
3602000	3603000	We know that's not there anyway.
3603000	3610000	So, I mean, I do like, I have to say, as much as this opinion may not be popular,
3610000	3615000	there's been other Nintendo stuff in the past where they slowly unraveled things.
3615000	3620000	Like, I seem to remember the original DS and the whole, like, downloading demos and all this.
3620000	3622000	That wasn't there when the system first launched.
3622000	3624000	That was something that came up later.
3624000	3625000	And the whole internet connectivity.
3625000	3630000	And it was like, that feature was just waiting in your DS the whole time to be enabled.
3630000	3635000	So if there's stuff like that that we don't yet know about that's kind of hiding and waiting in the Wii U,
3635000	3637000	that's kind of cool, I guess.
3637000	3642000	No, it's not cool because a system, a modern day system should have the ability to play demos.
3642000	3646000	Just like the Wii, you know, oh hey, we're gonna have an internet browser.
3646000	3648000	And it didn't fucking come out until later on.
3648000	3650000	And then they're, oh, well, we're gonna do this.
3650000	3652000	We're gonna have this internet browser come out now.
3652000	3657000	And, oh, maybe later on we'll have a way that you can store things, you know,
3657000	3661000	on your SD memory card instead of just backing up your saves on it.
3661000	3668000	Or, oh, I don't know, how about we just, you know, have a feature now where you can download digital copies of the games.
3668000	3670000	I mean, they're so far behind.
3670000	3673000	I mean, all these other companies have been doing this for a long time.
3673000	3678000	And it's just like they push it out to their customers like, oh, look at what Nintendo's doing.
3678000	3680000	We're offering demos of games.
3680000	3682000	And everyone's like, fuck yeah, that's amazing.
3682000	3684000	This is awfully new technology.
3684000	3687000	It's like, no, it's been fucking done for years now.
3687000	3690000	They were doing demos on the PlayStation 1.
3690000	3694000	And yet, for some reason, Nintendo's unable to give you a demo of anything.
3694000	3700000	I think Nintendo's big thing is that they've been trying to avoid anything that's going to damage,
3700000	3708000	not necessarily their reputation or their brand, but avoid ways for pirating,
3708000	3713000	avoid ways for region outsourcing, not outsourcing is not the word I'm thinking of,
3713000	3719000	but going outside the region, avoiding incidents for online chat.
3719000	3725000	They're really, really trying, I think, way too hard to preserve their brand.
3725000	3732000	And they're sacrificing a lot of the options that people have come to expect from a modern-day gaming system
3732000	3735000	for the sake of that little neurosis, I guess.
3735000	3740000	Well, let me get into this next story because it's almost right up the same alley of what we've been talking about here.
3740000	3748000	And this really caught wildfire all over the internet because Origin, the ever-popular EA service,
3748000	3750000	updated their privacy policy.
3750000	3754000	And this has a lot of people wondering, how exactly does Origin play into the Wii U?
3754000	3757000	Because in the new policy, it says, quote,
3757000	3764000	By signing up to play EA's titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA.
3764000	3771000	Information transfer to EA includes your Mii information, email address, Nintendo Network ID,
3771000	3775000	friends list, country, language, and date of birth.
3775000	3781000	So this seems to confirm that Origin will be a part of how you're going to play EA games on Wii U.
3781000	3785000	But my thought is, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3785000	3791000	Because before we start saying, oh my god, it's going to be Origin on the Wii U, which would be dreadful news indeed.
3791000	3795000	If I were to see that Origin logo pop up on the Wii U, I'd be like, it's over.
3795000	3800000	Nintendo did not convince me, they understand online, this is done, I'm done.
3800000	3808000	But, hold on a minute, because EA and your Origin account, they also interact with your Xbox 360 account and your PlayStation 3 account.
3808000	3810000	And your Wii.
3810000	3812000	Oh, and your original Wii, that's right, they do.
3812000	3817000	And all of that kind of interfaces in that EA console when you go on there.
3818000	3824000	So, I mean, like, hopefully this isn't much different.
3824000	3825000	I don't think it's any different.
3825000	3830000	Especially like, okay, maybe it just wants the Wii information, so put your little picture on the Origin account or whatever.
3830000	3832000	But I don't think that's a huge deal.
3832000	3834000	Some other people are learning out of this.
3834000	3835000	Make sure you haven't done penis face.
3835000	3844000	Yeah, to also draw out of this, the Nintendo Network ID is seemingly telling, that's a huge part of it, that where's the friend code.
3844000	3847000	So maybe they finally are doing some type of universal ID.
3847000	3852000	Is that an ID name that I get to pick, or is that a Nintendo Network ID number?
3852000	3854000	I don't know, we shall soon see.
3854000	3860000	So, of course, all the big blogs reaching out to Nintendo for comment, but they're not saying anything right now.
3860000	3867000	I wouldn't panic, I don't think this means it's Origin on Wii U, at least I hope not, because Origin is terrible.
3867000	3870000	And it will be a terrible thing for the Wii U.
3870000	3872000	If that happens.
3872000	3874000	They would never do that.
3874000	3880000	Like, I would not buy Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U if it has the Origin tie-in, there's literally no point.
3882000	3888000	Well, it's definitely gonna have Origin, Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U will have Origin, but, yeah.
3888000	3891000	But in what capacity? I mean, on the Xbox 360, you don't see it.
3891000	3893000	It's just like the Xbox 360.
3893000	3899000	Okay, that's fine then, because what it's doing, it's talking to Origin's servers to get your galaxy information and get some of that stuff,
3899000	3903000	and update your stuff on the EA social BioWare site or whatever.
3903000	3907000	That's fine, because the connectivity isn't happening through Origin.
3907000	3913000	But if on the Wii U, the connectivity is happening through Origin, that's gonna be a huge problem for me, because it stinks.
3913000	3921000	It's horrible. I mean, I never had a problem with Mass Effect 2, even though it registered all my stuff on Origin.
3921000	3923000	I still played it through Steam.
3923000	3926000	Well, technically I played it on its own because I bought it on Amazon.
3926000	3928000	But I ran it through Steam.
3928000	3934000	I never had a problem. It wouldn't connect to the servers right when I loaded it up, but I could log in.
3934000	3937000	I'm not even getting the option anymore with my Mass Effect 3.
3937000	3940000	Which, if it was the patch, I'm just saying.
3940000	3946000	But I think Origin has something to do with it too, even though I'm connecting just fine through Origin.
3946000	3950000	So, they just need to get their shit together.
3950000	3954000	Alright, well, unfortunately these are things we just aren't gonna know until the Wii U actually comes out.
3954000	3957000	So, meanwhile, more news. Dark Sakura.
3958000	3962000	Well, hopefully something better than freaking Origin.
3962000	3965000	How about Super Mario 64?
3965000	3970000	Sixteen years, this game, since this game has come out.
3970000	3973000	My husband and I used to play a crap ton of it.
3973000	3980000	Well, now there is a PC mod for Super Mario 64 that lets you play co-op online.
3980000	3985000	It was modded by Skelux? S-K-E-L-U-X?
3985000	3987000	At least it wasn't Skelux.
3987000	3988000	Seriously.
3988000	3990000	Because then the Mario theme would be...
3993000	3996000	And then it would be dial-up noise, the game.
3996000	4003000	But it's Super Mario Star Road, which is a site dedicated to Mario 64 mods.
4003000	4010000	But this one keeps the level design and everything, but makes it co-op.
4011000	4015000	You're not playing as Luigi, though, however.
4015000	4018000	You're playing as sort of a recolored Mario.
4018000	4019000	I mean...
4019000	4020000	Luigi.
4021000	4023000	But it's not like the taller...
4023000	4026000	It's like a gray Mario, gray and red Mario.
4026000	4029000	So, kind of like a palette swap.
4029000	4031000	But hey, it's cool.
4033000	4035000	I actually want to check this out.
4036000	4039000	Oh god, Tigerclaw in our chat room is telling me,
4039000	4040000	Rob, it's been done.
4040000	4042000	No! No!
4042000	4045000	It's the internet. Of course it's been done.
4046000	4049000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
4049000	4052000	and some video games that are coming to a store near you,
4052000	4054000	hopefully with less dubstep.
4054000	4059000	Well, we've got a few games coming out this week since we're in the fourth quarter.
4059000	4061000	So, let's start off.
4061000	4063000	They're doing some re-releases of stuff.
4064000	4070000	They have the Namco Museum DS and Pac-Man World 3 bundled together on one DS cart.
4070000	4072000	So, that's coming out.
4072000	4078000	Also Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur IV are bundled together on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4078000	4086000	We've got Assassin's Creed III on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and on PC.
4086000	4089000	Thundercats on the Nintendo DS.
4089000	4090000	Transformers...
4090000	4091000	Wow.
4091000	4094000	Hey, it's probably based off the new Thundercats series,
4094000	4096000	which is probably not that good.
4096000	4098000	Thundercat... or Thundercats.
4098000	4103000	Transformers Prime, the game on the Wii, the DS and the 3DS.
4103000	4108000	Also Nike Plus Connect training on Xbox 360.
4108000	4115000	Need for Speed Most Wanted on PS3, Xbox 360 and the Vita.
4115000	4116000	That's kind of cool.
4116000	4118000	Maybe a Vita game I can actually play.
4119000	4121000	Myst on the 3DS.
4122000	4127000	Moshi Monsters Moshlings Theme Park on DS and 3DS.
4127000	4131000	Toy Story Mania on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4131000	4136000	Those are kind of HD redos of the Wii game that came out.
4136000	4139000	The Trash Pack on DS and 3DS.
4139000	4144000	Zone of the Enders HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4145000	4147000	Let's see, moving on here.
4148000	4154000	We've got the Rockstar Games Collection Edition 1 on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4154000	4158000	Includes Red Dead Redemption, Midnight Club Los Angeles,
4158000	4164000	the Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City and L.A. Noire for 60 bucks.
4164000	4165000	That's not a bad deal.
4166000	4169000	Bratz Fashion Boutique on DS and 3DS.
4169000	4176000	And WWE 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii.
4176000	4180000	Lala Loopsie Carnival of Friends on DS and 3DS.
4180000	4184000	Winx Club Magical Fairy Party on Nintendo DS.
4184000	4190000	Wreck-It Ralph on Wii 3DS and DS.
4190000	4193000	And let's see here.
4193000	4198000	Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on Xbox 360 for Kinect.
4198000	4206000	And then, oddly enough, only the portable versions of LEGO Lord of the Rings this week on the DS, the 3DS, and the Vita.
4206000	4210000	And Need for Speed, most...
4210000	4212000	Or, I didn't mean Need for Speed.
4212000	4214000	I think that might be it.
4214000	4217000	Oh, and a PC version of LEGO Lord of the Rings this week as well.
4218000	4222000	Oh, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation on the Vita.
4222000	4224000	Can't forget that one. That's actually supposed to be pretty good.
4224000	4230000	Smartass on the Vita and Ragnarok Odyssey on the Vita as well.
4230000	4234000	So that's it for this week, I believe.
4235000	4238000	Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.
4238000	4247000	On November 1st, Medal of Honor Warfighter on the Xbox 360 and NBA 2K13 gets its Japanese release also on the 360.
4247000	4254000	Going to the PlayStation 3, Dead Island, Zombie of the Year Edition, Medal of Honor Warfighter on NBA 2K13.
4254000	4261000	Okami Zekke Kaiban, this is the HD remaster of Okami, is finally out on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4261000	4267000	And Tales of... Are you supposed to say Zilia or Shilia? Because it's an X.
4267000	4269000	Exilia? I think it's Tales of Shilia.
4269000	4271000	I think it could be Zilia.
4271000	4275000	Zilia? Alright, whatever. Tales of Zilia 2 is out this week.
4275000	4279000	And there's even a version that comes with a new DualShock controller and all this stuff.
4279000	4281000	I think Xylophone, Rob.
4281000	4285000	All these different little limited editions coming with that, so that's pretty exciting.
4285000	4287000	That must be a major holiday release in Japan.
4287000	4290000	Nothing on the Vita this week, really.
4290000	4294000	And just checking the 3DS real quick to see if we have anything there.
4295000	4301000	A black Nintendo 3DS XL and then one that has Monster Hunter 3G as well.
4301000	4305000	Oh, World Soccer Winning 11, 2013. There you go, soccer games.
4305000	4308000	That's it for Japanese releases, Dark Sakura.
4308000	4310000	Ah, I just dropped my yarn.
4310000	4311000	Oh, noes.
4311000	4312000	Hold on.
4312000	4315000	As I had the list up.
4315000	4322000	Coming out on the 30th, we have Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation for Vita.
4323000	4325000	Sorry if I sound weird, I just took a cough drop.
4325000	4330000	31st, Assassin's Creed 3 for 360 and PlayStation 3.
4330000	4332000	Sports Champions 2 for PS3.
4332000	4335000	And now I have to move on to November's dates.
4339000	4340000	Stupid thing.
4342000	4343000	November.
4345000	4350000	On the 1st, we have WWE 13 for a number of systems.
4350000	4358000	On the 2nd, Football Manager 2013, Just Dance 4, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Nike Plus Connect Training, Silent Hill Book of Memories.
4358000	4359000	That's it.
4362000	4363000	Alrighty.
4363000	4367000	Just a few more news stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.
4367000	4369000	What did Dark Sakura pick this week?
4369000	4371000	Find out after two more stories.
4371000	4372000	Loki.
4372000	4378000	Well, it's unfortunate that we have to report on more closures and layoffs.
4378000	4382000	But Zynga has laid off 5% of their workforce.
4382000	4384000	Kind of a restructuring that they're doing.
4384000	4387000	They let go roughly 3200 employees.
4387000	4392000	And with that, they've closed Zynga's Boston studio.
4392000	4400000	And also, the studios in Japan and UK are being kind of slated for shutdowns soon.
4400000	4406000	Also, the Austin office, they've laid off quite a few people there.
4406000	4413000	And they've also shut down, I guess, 13 of their older games.
4413000	4420000	And what they quote, significantly reducing their investment in The Ville.
4420000	4425000	Probably a good thing being since, you know, they're being sued by EA for The Ville.
4425000	4429000	So, it sounds like the outlook on that is not too favorable.
4431000	4433000	That's kind of disappointing.
4433000	4434000	You know what Dan told me?
4434000	4437000	He said that their stock right now is lower than Radio Shack.
4437000	4439000	Ouch!
4439000	4441000	Yeah, that's pretty bad.
4444000	4448000	Alright. I got one more story for you too.
4448000	4451000	By the way, that was shady that they did that during the whole Apple conference.
4451000	4454000	Like, a lot of people assumed that was intentional.
4454000	4456000	Maybe it really wasn't.
4456000	4460000	Just to give Zynga what little shred of doubt I can,
4460000	4463000	maybe that actually wasn't intentional that they did it during the Apple conference.
4463000	4466000	Because seriously, how are you going to hide something like that?
4466000	4468000	You think the internet wouldn't notice?
4468000	4469000	Come on.
4469000	4472000	I think it was just a coincidence. I really do.
4472000	4475000	But it really didn't make them look good, that's for sure.
4475000	4477000	Windows 8 came out this week.
4477000	4480000	I don't know how many of you guys are excited about Windows 8.
4480000	4481000	Can I quote a movie?
4481000	4482000	What?
4482000	4483000	Whoopty shit.
4483000	4486000	Well, you know, I don't know. I'm trying to judge my Facebook.
4486000	4489000	Some people went and got it the day it came out and they're actually really excited about it.
4489000	4491000	Like, they're really enjoying it.
4491000	4492000	So, I don't know.
4492000	4498000	I'm going to give it a couple months before that whole super sale's done at the end of January to see if it's something I really need.
4498000	4501000	But, I bet you're dying to know.
4501000	4502000	What about the games?
4502000	4504000	What are the games that come with Windows 8?
4504000	4506000	Well, let's tell you about the new games with Windows 8.
4506000	4510000	Microsoft Solitaire Collection is one of the games in Windows 8.
4510000	4513000	Which, of course, it's Windows that's got to have Solitaire, right?
4513000	4516000	Remember, these all have achievements and stuff, too.
4517000	4523000	There's, like, Klondike Solitaire and Pyramid and, you know, all the stuff you'd be used to.
4523000	4526000	Minesweeper is back in Windows 8.
4526000	4528000	But, here's the crazy part.
4528000	4531000	Minesweeper now has an adventure mode.
4531000	4532000	What?
4532000	4533000	No one, Kerr.
4533000	4534000	Look at the screenshot.
4534000	4536000	It's like little explorer dude going through the cave.
4536000	4537000	Yep.
4537000	4538000	Hey, you know what?
4538000	4543000	As much as you say no one, Kerr, I got to say it looks better.
4543000	4545000	Mr. Driller did it better.
4547000	4548000	Whatever.
4548000	4550000	Other games within Windows 8.
4550000	4555000	Microsoft Mahjong, which I think they've kind of been including ever since, you know, Shanghai.
4555000	4557000	The old PC game was popular.
4557000	4559000	I love Mahjong.
4559000	4562000	Wordament is a new game.
4562000	4564000	And this is your basic, like, boggle clone.
4564000	4567000	There's a lot of word games like this that exist there.
4567000	4570000	The game also exists on Windows Phone 7, just so you know.
4570000	4574000	Tap Tiles is another game that's included in Windows 8.
4574000	4577000	And lastly, a game called Adara.
4577000	4581000	It's kind of got like a little story that goes with it.
4581000	4585000	A stone and sorcery magic type game, but it's more like a puzzler.
4585000	4587000	Don't get like a, you know, I don't know.
4587000	4590000	But, yeah, it's like a very simple type of adventure game.
4590000	4592000	So, that's another free Windows 8 game.
4592000	4593000	So, there you go.
4593000	4598000	We've come a long way since the days of just good old Solitaire with the bouncing card when you finish, right?
4598000	4599000	You know what, Rob?
4599000	4603000	The moment that you said that, my brain instantly went to like a Virginia Slims ad.
4603000	4604000	How so?
4604000	4611000	With like gamers, you know, sitting around making shit faces at, you know, Windows 8.
4611000	4613000	And it has, you've come a long way, baby.
4616000	4623000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, work.
4623000	4628000	Alright, let's travel back to when Solitaire was all you got.
4628000	4631000	A classic time in gaming's past.
4631000	4633000	It's the classic game of the week.
4633000	4643000	Dark Soccer is going to open up the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you, listen, classic game, play, now.
4643000	4645000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4645000	4654000	Classic game of the week is Panzer Dragoon, which I thought that I had done it before, but I had done Saga or RPG as we got it.
4654000	4657000	Or as, I'm sorry, as it came out in Japan.
4658000	4662000	So, Panzer Dragoon is a rail shooter by Team Andromeda.
4662000	4664000	It came out on the Saturn in 1995.
4664000	4667000	And then later on, there were other versions for PC, PS2.
4667000	4673000	And it came as a bonus in Panzer Dragoon order on Xbox.
4673000	4682000	So, you basically play as Kael Fluge, who is unnamed in the US version.
4683000	4687000	And basically, you just go through and you shoot stuff.
4687000	4690000	But the game's freaking gorgeous.
4690000	4697000	I mean, people gave the Saturn shit for its 3D, and yeah, it didn't do 3D as good as the Playstation did.
4697000	4704000	It was built originally as a 2D machine, but this game really illustrated what you could do with the Saturn.
4705000	4711000	So basically, you have machines and monsters as your enemies.
4711000	4715000	And it's sort of like a post-apocalyptic fantasy world.
4715000	4724000	So you have to go through, you've got the different boss battles that actually pause the game before the boss battles.
4724000	4731000	And then you have X and Y axis that you can move across on for those boss battles.
4732000	4735000	But basically, you can look all the way around.
4735000	4739000	I mean, your enemies are coming from everywhere, but you're still on rails.
4741000	4744000	So you've got two weapons. You have a handgun.
4744000	4748000	And then you have a homing laser that your dragon fires.
4748000	4751000	It has six levels, each one about five minutes.
4751000	4753000	And then there's a boss battle.
4753000	4756000	And the sixth, though, is a special boss battle.
4756000	4761000	I have to say that, just going back into this one.
4761000	4767000	Now, I played a little bit of it, but you know how I get with certain games.
4767000	4770000	I'm with Emotionsick. This is one that made me Emotionsick.
4770000	4776000	However, since this was a Sega game, of course it was out on the Saturn.
4776000	4783000	It started off, though, as a different project.
4783000	4787000	And they said that they were trying to develop a shoot-em-up game.
4787000	4791000	And it eventually evolved into Panzer and Dragoon.
4792000	4796000	So, yeah, pretty awesome game.
4796000	4802000	But they were under a big time frame for actually developing it.
4802000	4810000	And the original name of the game was actually Kikuryu, which is armored dragon.
4810000	4815000	But they wanted to pick something that sounded a little bit more exciting.
4815000	4818000	So they picked a German name, Panzer and Dragoon.
4818000	4821000	And there you go.
4822000	4823000	That's it?
4823000	4824000	That's it.
4824000	4826000	What a pretty game, though, especially for its time.
4826000	4827000	That's a gorgeous game.
4827000	4832000	Well, it was actually named the best Saturn game of 1995 by EGM.
4832000	4834000	RIP.
4834000	4842000	And this game also sold well enough that they could do Panzer and Dragoon's V.
4842000	4846000	Which, of course, is keeping with that German naming.
4846000	4853000	It was also one up, give it a retro review of 8 out of 10.
4855000	4857000	So, not bad.
4857000	4858000	Alright.
4858000	4860000	There it is, Panzer and Dragoon, your classic game of the week.
4860000	4862000	Good pick, DarkSakura. Good pick.
4862000	4863000	Well, thank Dan.
4863000	4865000	Alright, good pick, Dan. Good pick.
4865000	4866000	Alright.
4866000	4868000	I was like, what should I pick?
4868000	4870000	You can bring Dan back to the show. We have a fourth mic now.
4870000	4874000	Thanks to the kind, benevolent people at Pod Culture.
4874000	4877000	If you have Dan all the time, then it's not special.
4880000	4883000	You must like my life. I mean, wait.
4883000	4884000	Alright.
4884000	4886000	That's going to do it for part A.
4886000	4889000	But don't go anywhere. We have a very busy part B when we come back.
4890000	4892000	We're going to do some rapid fire news.
4892000	4894000	The Fugu question of the week and listless.
4894000	4899000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4905000	4908000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4908000	4913000	We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 28th of 2012,
4913000	4917000	with the 479th episode of our show.
4917000	4920000	Getting into part B and we'll be doing some rapid fire news
4920000	4923000	and the Fugu question of the week and a special listless tonight.
4923000	4927000	But first, we have some breaking news to start off part B.
4927000	4928000	Breaking news.
4939000	4945000	The eighth annual podcast award nominees are in at podcastawards.com.
4945000	4948000	And we got nominated!
4950000	4954000	Orange Lounge Radio is a nominee for Best Gaming.
4954000	4957000	And there's ten shows in the gaming category,
4957000	4960000	including a couple that also got some bigger nominations
4960000	4962000	for People's Choice and Best Produced.
4962000	4965000	So it's going to be some big competition this year.
4965000	4968000	And unfortunately, kind of on the downside,
4968000	4970000	a lot of these are corpcasts this year.
4970000	4973000	I soon remember last year it was all indie podcasts.
4973000	4976000	And there are some indie podcasts in this list.
4976000	4978000	Like, I recognize Gamertag Radio is a great show.
4978000	4981000	Minecraft Me, I think, is indie.
4981000	4982000	I don't know where some of the...
4982000	4984000	I imagine The Independent Characters is one, too.
4984000	4986000	So there's some other good shows in the air.
4986000	4989000	So we want one of the indies to win.
4989000	4992000	Obviously, we would really like it very much if it's us.
4992000	4993000	A specific indie to win.
4993000	4996000	Yes, we very much want this specific indie to win.
4996000	4999000	However, if we can't, we really hope one of the indies takes it.
4999000	5001000	So good luck to the indies in here.
5001000	5004000	As far as the corpcast goes, you're going down.
5004000	5006000	So podcastworks.com.
5006000	5008000	Power to the people, yo. Power to people.
5008000	5012000	The Daily Voting, and I don't know all of those shows,
5012000	5015000	so I apologize if you are an indie show and I did not name you specifically.
5015000	5019000	I will do more research before voting opens on November 1st,
5019000	5020000	is when the voting opens.
5020000	5022000	So there you go.
5022000	5029000	We will be trying to whore for your votes like crazy come November 1st,
5029000	5030000	because we are going to need them.
5030000	5032000	And you can vote every day.
5032000	5033000	Yes, you can vote every day.
5033000	5035000	So we will be reminding you every day. So please help.
5035000	5038000	Remember, we don't ask for money.
5038000	5040000	We don't ask for, you know, subscriptions.
5040000	5044000	We don't have a plus feed or something that you pay extra money to get.
5044000	5049000	All we want, we want your votes to help us spread the word.
5049000	5052000	I'm not saying that, you know, obviously we want legit votes,
5052000	5055000	but they do allow one vote per email address.
5055000	5060000	Tigerclaw in chat says, Rob, aren't you torn that Horde House did not get nominated?
5060000	5063000	Actually, it's much easier this way,
5063000	5066000	because then I only have to champion for one show to get votes,
5066000	5068000	because that would be weird if the other show had gotten nominated.
5068000	5073000	I did notice it was interesting that the instance wasn't nominated,
5073000	5075000	because I know they've been nominated almost every year,
5075000	5078000	so maybe they didn't go for it this year. I don't know.
5078000	5082000	Also, Four Player Podcast, they've had the lock on this thing for, like,
5082000	5086000	three, four years, because they have a huge fan community, and they're very rabid.
5086000	5088000	They were not eligible this year.
5088000	5091000	That's why they're not nominated, because they won the biggest of the big awards last year,
5091000	5093000	and there's some weird rules.
5093000	5096000	So, they'll be back next year, guaranteed,
5096000	5099000	so if there's any year we actually stand a chance in hell to win,
5099000	5105000	it's going to be this year, so please throw us your votes come November 1st.
5105000	5107000	There you go.
5107000	5110000	And, unfortunately, I also have to say this,
5110000	5112000	no other VOG show nominated. I looked.
5112000	5116000	I was a little depressed, because I know I nominated some,
5116000	5122000	but I guess it was just a lot of competition or what have you,
5122000	5125000	and we were whoring the nominations quite a bit,
5125000	5127000	so hopefully we were able to catch some eyes there.
5127000	5132000	But we're going to do our best to represent VOG and try to win it for us.
5132000	5134000	Like the whores we are.
5134000	5136000	So, there you go.
5136000	5139000	Thank you guys very much for helping that happen.
5139000	5143000	I really, really, really appreciate it, and lots of celebratory stuff in chat right now.
5143000	5144000	I appreciate it.
5144000	5145000	A City Vampire says,
5145000	5148000	Will you pay me to vote for you?
5148000	5151000	We'll pay you in hugs and kisses.
5151000	5154000	We are not like the presidential nominees, hello?
5154000	5156000	We don't pay people for our votes?
5156000	5157000	Taiki says,
5157000	5163000	Fuck the podcast awards after irreligiosophy got snubbed twice.
5163000	5168000	Well, you know, I've kind of had some give and take feelings about the podcast awards,
5168000	5170000	because let's be real, it is a huge popularity contest.
5170000	5172000	However, it's great promotion.
5172000	5176000	I'm not going to lie, it's great promotion, so we've got to do the best we can.
5176000	5177000	So there you go.
5177000	5182000	Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick gaming news for you guys.
5182000	5183000	Loki, start us off.
5183000	5191000	So if you like collectible figures, there's going to be some new vinyl figures coming out from Funko Pop.
5191000	5196000	They've got some Halo 4 figures, very chibi looking.
5196000	5201000	They've got Cortana, and it looks like Master Chief.
5201000	5207000	And a couple other of the Spartans, they've got a red Spartan and a blue Spartan.
5207000	5210000	So those should be coming soon.
5210000	5215000	I'd get a red one, but make him purple so it could be Donut.
5215000	5217000	Or pink.
5217000	5220000	Yes, that'd be pretty cool.
5220000	5224000	And I'm sure you could, you know, paint your own Spartan if you want to.
5224000	5229000	But I believe those are going to be available soon if they're not already available.
5229000	5235000	I mean, they've got to be probably available now since Halo comes out in a week.
5235000	5239000	So, man, it's already a week? Crazy.
5239000	5243000	Oh yeah, that's right, because it's election day that it comes out. Crazy.
5243000	5246000	Wow, election days are right around the corner.
5246000	5249000	And then all this bullshit will be over.
5249000	5251000	Where is my melee?
5252000	5254000	I got mine.
5254000	5257000	I got mine like two weeks ago.
5257000	5261000	Okay, so Team Fortress 2, they're doing some fun stuff for Halloween.
5261000	5265000	Of course, Scream Fortress is coming back.
5265000	5270000	And what would come with your staple Halloween thing?
5270000	5273000	Why, of course, zombies. Zombies would come.
5273000	5280000	And they've got different events going on, including haunted King of the Hill matches.
5280000	5288000	Also, they've got, I guess, a game, or was it, Bombinup Con?
5288000	5293000	And some wizards and stuff. It's all, of course, you know, Halloween themed.
5293000	5299000	And they're going to have a brand new man versus machine mission called Wave 666.
5299000	5302000	Which will have undead robot enemies.
5302000	5309000	So, neat. And I'm sure there's some unique cats to be had there, because why wouldn't they have unique cats?
5310000	5319000	And then, not to be outdone by Just Dance 4, but Dance Central 3 will also be getting Gangnam Style as well.
5319000	5322000	And that should be coming pretty soon.
5322000	5325000	Also, call me maybe.
5325000	5331000	Uh oh, Loki. Uh oh. You know what you said, didn't you? You said it.
5331000	5343000	It came on my radio, I said last week.
5343000	5347000	It's like Pee Wee's Playhouse. Whenever somebody says the secret word, you just have to start, you just have to get down.
5347000	5353000	I love that gif that's out there, by the way, of the football player that's getting down doing the Gangnam Style dance.
5353000	5358000	They're seeing other artists that are going to be coming soon.
5359000	5364000	Justin Bieber, One Direction, LMFAO, and um, yeah, that's all they've mentioned so far.
5364000	5368000	Did you hear about the hacking of Justin Bieber's Twitter?
5368000	5376000	That was fucked up. Oh my god. That was so fucked up. I am sorry.
5376000	5377000	That was amazing.
5377000	5382000	It's one of those things you're laughing at and then you're like, oh my god, I'm going to hell for laughing at this because this is terrible.
5382000	5384000	Alright, repeat it for those that may not have heard.
5384000	5393000	So I think it was Fortran people that did it hacked Justin Bieber's Twitter and posted that he had cancer and was going bald from his treatments.
5393000	5402000	So all these girls started shaving their head and posting little signs that said bald for Bieber.
5402000	5407000	That is messed up. That's hilarious.
5407000	5411000	Just goes to show the whole, you know, sheep thing, you know?
5411000	5418000	That's hilarious. And then they're probably disappointed when he's not really dying from cancer.
5418000	5421000	Alright, let's move on.
5421000	5426000	Going to news about the Commodore 64. Yeah, you heard me. Commodore 64.
5426000	5433000	Super Crate Box is a game that's been out there and it's turned 2 this past week and they did a free iOS version to celebrate.
5433000	5440000	However, what's awesome, they're doing a game called Super Bread Box that's going to be an adaptation of the game on the Commodore 64
5440000	5445000	by the guys who did C64 Cannibalt.
5445000	5453000	So there's already a YouTube out there. This is going to be available, they say, in early December.
5453000	5457000	Check out that awesome soundtrack.
5457000	5462000	God, the C64 was so great.
5462000	5464000	Flamethrower.
5464000	5466000	Every game needs a flamethrower.
5466000	5469000	A brand new website launched this week that has a lot of people excited.
5469000	5472000	Polygon.com finally officially launched this week.
5472000	5479000	And it's notable because there's a lot of game journalists, like people that were big on Joystiq before and Kotaku before and some other websites,
5479000	5482000	that kind of all came together to form this website.
5482000	5486000	And I saw a lot of people on Twitter that were kind of spazzing about the website launching.
5486000	5489000	And, you know, it's a nice looking website.
5489000	5492000	I don't know. Jamie, have you seen this website at all yet?
5492000	5495000	How do you feel about their design choices on this website?
5495000	5501000	Because I actually didn't, I mean, I like the writing, and that's the important part.
5501000	5502000	So I want to get that clear.
5502000	5509000	It is really easy to read, but I like when it scrolls to a point and that, is that Skeletor?
5509000	5516000	Yes. Here's what I don't, I don't like these images that suddenly take up the whole horizontal, intermixed with these vertical things.
5516000	5518000	That's the one thing I really don't like.
5518000	5525000	The other problem with that being too is that you're going to deal with different resolutions and this is clearly optimized for max resolution.
5525000	5528000	So it's not going to work for everybody.
5528000	5531000	Right. The mobile site's really good looking though. I will say that.
5531000	5534000	So congrats to them for finally starting this, but I am going to say one little thing.
5534000	5537000	I am going to dog on this here because, you know, we do that.
5537000	5542000	I don't get the whole documentary and making of stuff.
5542000	5544000	That, that's a little too much ego for me.
5544000	5545000	A little smug.
5545000	5547000	It is a little smug. It's very smug.
5547000	5552000	And I, you know, all these little documentaries about the launching of the website and the making of the website.
5552000	5553000	No one gives a fuck except for you.
5553000	5555000	That shit should be organic.
5555000	5561000	That's, I mean, this feels like forced and it makes me not want to like your website.
5561000	5563000	Like to be, I'm just being perfectly honest.
5563000	5568000	Now I do like the writing and I like, you know, a lot of the people that are there and ultimately that wins out.
5568000	5574000	But I got to say all that self-serving bullshit is kind of unnecessary.
5574000	5578000	That'd be like hosting an awards ceremony where you're going to award yourself for being so awesome.
5578000	5580000	I mean, I'm sure that's right around the corner.
5580000	5583000	Polygon's awards for Polygon.
5583000	5585000	The, the others.
5585000	5591000	And realize that we just told people to please go vote for us in an online award ceremony, but I'm sorry.
5591000	5596000	Yeah, but I don't have a fucking documentary about, yeah, like let me start a new website.
5596000	5599000	I'm going to create a documentary about starting said website.
5599000	5611000	The, but really to go back to this though, is that their design, I like, I like consistency.
5611000	5619000	You have to have consistency with a good website and with it switching back and forth, you're really not giving it enough consistency.
5619000	5627000	Plus you're, you know, you're sacrificing memory for people who may not be optimized to use your, uh, your site.
5627000	5631000	I prefer it to keep a constant format.
5631000	5635000	I like the large splash image up at the top and then the site going into it.
5635000	5638000	I like the three column your, uh, point of view.
5638000	5641000	I just think that you need to pick a style and stick with it.
5641000	5646000	Um, but at the end of the day, of course the writing is the most important and they do have some really interesting in-depth articles.
5646000	5648000	Writing doesn't do anything if you can't find shit.
5648000	5652000	Snap.
5652000	5653000	All right.
5653000	5656000	Uh, let's move on to one other quick thing I want to get out here.
5656000	5663000	Uh, Jason, one of our, um, co-hosts, we sometimes have a guest host here on the show and our lovely webmaster of orange-on-street.com wanted me to plug this.
5663000	5665000	And to this I say, but of course.
5665000	5668000	Uh, how many of you are fans of the website GitHub?
5668000	5673000	GitHub's a pretty awesome site for, um, developers, programmers, and, and basically nerds.
5673000	5674000	Let's be, let's be honest.
5674000	5675000	It's a super nerd site.
5675000	5680000	Well, uh, GitHub is going to be doing a game jam of their very own.
5681000	5688000	Uh, there you have the entire month of November to create a web-based game and it's got to be loosely built around one of these themes.
5688000	5692000	Forking, that's forking like a spoon or a fork, or forks.
5692000	5694000	Branching or branches.
5694000	5695000	Cloning or clones.
5695000	5696000	Pushing or pulling.
5696000	5698000	What do we mean loosely based?
5698000	5699000	They mean loosely based.
5699000	5704000	Like, you could do a first person shooter where you throw forks and so on and so on.
5704000	5705000	Some of the prizes.
5705000	5708000	Shiny new iPads with retina displays.
5708000	5709000	Ooh, ah.
5709000	5712000	Uh, GitHub swag and so forth.
5712000	5720000	And, you know, featuring on the GitHub blog, which considering that this is a pretty popular website with nerds is, uh, probably reward enough in itself.
5720000	5725000	And, uh, some, also some, uh, FaceTime in front of some pretty, uh, great judges here.
5725000	5730000	You have the CEO of Garage Games, co-founder of Lost Decade Games, et cetera, et cetera.
5730000	5731000	So, uh, check that out.
5731000	5736000	It's called the Game Off and it's, uh, featured at github.com.
5736000	5741000	I know you said Game Off, but for a moment I thought you said Game Moth.
5741000	5747000	I was thinking of this little moth with big rainbow wings flying around to, uh, Abba.
5747000	5748000	So.
5748000	5749000	Awesome.
5749000	5750000	All right. Well, that's all I have.
5750000	5752000	Dark Soccer, what's up next for you?
5752000	5754000	I have more stuff.
5754000	5756000	And a voice that's failing.
5756000	5762000	Um, Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition is coming out for PC for 1990.
5762000	5765000	Um, it has Warp Zones.
5765000	5767000	Yeah, Warp Zones.
5767000	5775000	Then, um, there is a, uh, uh, nine minutes of footage up for the Mass Effect 3 prequel,
5775000	5781000	uh, which is, uh, Paragon Lost, which I think I'm like the only Mass Effect fan that's really excited about this.
5781000	5782000	So I don't know.
5782000	5783000	I'm going to check it out.
5783000	5785000	It's Vega. It's about Vega.
5785000	5787000	But, oh, hi, Marco.
5787000	5798000	Um, so, uh, you've got Freddie Prinze Jr., you know, playing Vega with his, you know, not very good, you know, Spanish.
5798000	5800000	That's loco.
5800000	5810000	Um, but it should be, uh, the actual DVD and Blu-ray will be out on December 28th in the US.
5810000	5814000	Although there is not a date, um, on, uh, for the UK yet.
5815000	5816000	Give it time.
5816000	5817000	So, yeah, you can find the footage out.
5817000	5825000	And then, um, there is a, uh, Halloween bundle, um, from Indie Royale.
5825000	5830000	Um, it has, uh, Sam and Max, The Devil's Playhouse, the full season.
5830000	5832000	It has a home.
5832000	5838000	It has Pathologic, um, McGuffin's Curse, and Evil Quest.
5839000	5850000	And if you, uh, pay over $8, you also receive, um, a flak or MP3 copy of C. Jeff's, um, chiptune album, um, Presh Tale.
5850000	5852000	So there it goes.
5852000	5857000	You know, I was hoping that McGuffin's Curse, I kind of read that as McGruff's Curse.
5857000	5858000	I know.
5858000	5860000	Take a bite out of crime.
5860000	5865000	It's a, it's a noir, a film noir game starring McGruff, a crime dog.
5865000	5868000	Whatever happened to McGruff, the crime dog?
5868000	5871000	I think he got replaced with something more hip and young.
5873000	5874000	Cause, you know.
5874000	5875000	Dude, McGruff was cool.
5875000	5877000	What could be more hip than McGruff?
5877000	5879000	I don't understand.
5879000	5881000	Uh, I don't know.
5881000	5883000	1981.
5883000	5884000	Let me take a look at this.
5884000	5885000	Good lord.
5885000	5887000	Look at this. I love you, YouTube. Here we go.
5890000	5893000	You know what I think? I think you forgot to lock your door.
5893000	5895000	A lot of people do that. They forget.
5895000	5899000	That's too bad because all crime needs is a chance.
5899000	5901000	Don't give it the chance.
5901000	5904000	It's my job to teach you to protect yourselves.
5904000	5906000	Make it your job to learn.
5906000	5909000	Write to Box 6600 Rockville, Maryland.
5909000	5911000	Oh, and one more thing.
5911000	5914000	Lock your door and take a bite out of crime.
5917000	5920000	I don't understand, like, that was a commercial on TV.
5920000	5922000	Lock your damn door.
5922000	5925000	When I was a little kid, we actually didn't lock our doors that much.
5925000	5929000	I guess that's true. Growing up, you know, and it was different times.
5929000	5933000	And especially if you lived somewhere a little more rural, there's still a lot of places like that.
5933000	5935000	I didn't live somewhere rural. I lived in the suburbs.
5935000	5937000	But there's a lot of places still like that.
5937000	5939000	That they don't lock their doors at night.
5939000	5941000	And, you know, McGruff would like you to take a bite out of crime.
5943000	5947000	Oh my god, they had the drinking and driving commercial on there with the two beer mugs.
5947000	5949000	That was awesome.
5949000	5952000	That used to be my favorite commercial because it was like breaking noises and beer.
5952000	5956000	They had a McGruff the crime dog monster truck.
5958000	5962000	Rama in chat says, I remember when McGruff the crime dog came to my elementary school.
5962000	5964000	Did he take a bite out of the principal?
5966000	5970000	Stan says he was fired when they found a dead prostitute in McGruff's car.
5970000	5972000	Oh, well, that answers everything. Thank you.
5972000	5974000	It's always the dead prostitutes.
5974000	5976000	They find themselves everywhere.
5976000	5978000	God, they ruin everything. Damn those dead prostitutes.
5978000	5981000	Alright, let's take a bite out of the Fugal Question of the Week.
5989000	5994000	Why, you take Facebook and you take Google Plus and you sandwich them together and you get Fugal.
5994000	5996000	It's the Fugal Question of the Week.
5996000	5999000	And, you know, with all the hurricane stuff going on in the world,
5999000	6002000	they have me thinking about storms, knocking out the power and all this.
6003000	6009000	So, the Fugal Question of the Week, available at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community is,
6009000	6014000	tell us a story about a time when game over came too soon.
6014000	6018000	In other words, have you ever had an experience where you were really into playing a video game
6018000	6021000	and then suddenly the power went out, the internet went out,
6021000	6024000	a parent came in and turned off the system while you were playing.
6024000	6026000	How did you react?
6026000	6028000	Alright, well, I'll get to the host in a minute.
6028000	6030000	Yeah, something just popped into my head.
6030000	6031000	Let's start with act-deaf.
6031000	6037000	I remember one night when playing Outrun on XBLA on Bobby Blackwell's Friday night gaming show.
6037000	6041000	I got the game on the last minute and got into the last race of the show.
6041000	6044000	I was kicking ass when suddenly my connection dropped.
6044000	6049000	I seriously was pissed as hell, especially since I was bragging how good I was at racing games
6049000	6052000	to have that happen in the middle of a live stream.
6053000	6055000	That's what you get for talking all that smack.
6055000	6057000	Alright, let's see.
6058000	6060000	Panaxium answers the question.
6060000	6063000	It says, for me, it was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.
6063000	6067000	I was trying to beat that obnoxious final boss for over an hour.
6067000	6073000	When I was finally about to beat the damn thing, my dad gracefully trips over the GameCube cables,
6073000	6075000	yanking the power out of it.
6075000	6079000	I remember doing Evader-style, no!
6079000	6084000	He looked at the blank screen a few seconds, then turned to me with a big dorky grin and said,
6084000	6087000	sorry, I'm prone to power trips.
6089000	6091000	That was horrible.
6093000	6095000	That was some punishment for the show.
6096000	6101000	And Panaxium ends it with, thank you so much for that, dad.
6105000	6107000	I'm prone to power trips.
6110000	6111000	Let's see.
6112000	6115000	Going to Facebook to get some of the questions here.
6115000	6116000	Let's see.
6116000	6119000	Brandon H. answered the question and said,
6119000	6122000	just unlocked everything in Guitar Hero 3,
6122000	6126000	then in the middle of saving the power went out and then it came back on,
6126000	6129000	Red Ring of Death and Corrupted Saves.
6129000	6135000	That was a really bad day, to have your machine Red Ring of Death on top of the power failure
6135000	6137000	and corrupt your saves.
6137000	6138000	That sucks.
6139000	6140000	Let's see.
6140000	6143000	Joe G. answers on Facebook and says,
6143000	6145000	oh, excuse me, I used the wrong name.
6145000	6147000	So you have to put it at the beginning or I might miss it.
6147000	6149000	Haseo Sumeruagawa says,
6149000	6150000	I was playing Borderlands.
6150000	6155000	I was on Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot and I was playing the last arena there
6155000	6157000	and was about three quarters of the way through
6157000	6160000	and I had finished all other quests from the games and Zombie Island is rolling.
6160000	6164000	I died, got booted out and I played the whole thing offline, mind you,
6164000	6166000	so when I died I was shit out of luck
6166000	6172000	and what the fuck did the autosave and power flipped off,
6172000	6177000	corrupting the save data and I think people in Texas heard me yelling obscenities.
6178000	6180000	Burr replies,
6180000	6184000	Growing up I always remember getting kicked off the computer mid-game
6184000	6186000	because my mom wanted me to take a break and go outside.
6186000	6191000	I always end up spending my time away from the game thinking about what was going to happen next
6191000	6194000	and it would continue on to the next day during school.
6194000	6199000	You can physically separate a gamer from their drug, but you can't keep it out of their mind.
6199000	6201000	James S. replied and said,
6201000	6206000	When I was about six years old I was playing Yoshi's Cookie on the original Game Boy.
6206000	6208000	That game was awesome, just saying.
6208000	6210000	I love that game on the SNES.
6210000	6213000	You're marked that for a classic game some week because I love Yoshi's Cookie.
6213000	6217000	Out of frustration on a high level I proceeded to rage
6217000	6223000	and I slammed the Game Boy against my head, causing the screen to shatter instantly.
6223000	6230000	Keep in mind I was six. I've never been so mortified yet satisfied in my entire life.
6230000	6237000	Ouch. Have you ever, like, has your rage ever broken something that was like several hundred dollars like that?
6237000	6241000	Dan, back in the day, would break controllers.
6241000	6247000	And one time he took a controller back, he bought a new controller and then returned the controller,
6247000	6250000	except he returned the broken controller.
6250000	6252000	I think it was like a Saturn controller.
6252000	6253000	Wow.
6253000	6255000	Ronnie B. answered and said,
6255000	6258000	When I first moved to where I am now the breakers would trip every day,
6258000	6262000	often erasing hours of my Civ progress on the 360.
6262000	6269000	I also hate when broken games, often downloadable games, glitch so badly the only option is to restart
6269000	6272000	due to locked menus, stuck cameras, or whatever.
6272000	6276000	SSJ100Matt with an arcade answer. I like this.
6276000	6280000	Back when I used to play a lot of Initial D in the arcade during my college years,
6280000	6284000	I once lost my entire record and stats for my main car in the game.
6284000	6290000	I was in the process of transferring my data from Initial D2 to Initial D3 and the machine errored out
6290000	6293000	and my card got jammed inside the machine.
6293000	6299000	Since my Initial D2 card was already voided because of the transfer, I lost everything.
6299000	6302000	Several months worth of work on my main car was gone forever.
6302000	6306000	Needless to say I was frustrated, but after it happened I quit playing Initial D.
6306000	6312000	All the work that went into building that one car and then losing it got rid of my inspiration and drive,
6312000	6314000	pun intended,
6317000	6319000	to play the game anymore then.
6320000	6322000	Let's see, I'm going to do one more answer here.
6322000	6323000	Hitstun says,
6323000	6329000	A few months ago I was at KDB in Columbus and saw a couple of guys playing the Tekken 6 machine.
6329000	6332000	They finished their match, I asked if I could play winner and they let me join in.
6332000	6338000	At the character select screen I put in my card with my character on it and the cabinet froze.
6338000	6340000	The other guy was not too pleased and he asked,
6340000	6342000	Did you do that on purpose? Why did you have to end my game?
6342000	6348000	I felt terrible. Maybe my card got corrupted somehow and I just ended a good play session between friends.
6348000	6353000	Eventually I had them follow me to go track down an attendant so we could both get refunds.
6353000	6357000	The Tekken 6 cabinet eventually rebooted but neither of us went back to play it again.
6357000	6360000	Those are some good answers and I didn't read everything, I apologize,
6360000	6367000	but go check out the rest of the answers at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or our Google Plus community.
6367000	6371000	Let's go around the room and see if anybody has things to share.
6371000	6373000	Dark Soccer, I know you said you had something.
6373000	6379000	When I was in high school my little brother Matthew got hit by a car.
6380000	6387000	He was six and that night basically I got dropped off at the mall with my best friend Jennifer.
6387000	6394000	We went to the movies, we went to the arcade because basically there's like here's some money.
6394000	6398000	I ended up getting in on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game in the arcade.
6398000	6403000	This was the first time I'd ever played a full four player game.
6403000	6406000	They had me on Leonardo so I was like okay he's kind of cool.
6406000	6414000	We got all the way to the end of the game, had just got the last hit, and they shut off the machines.
6414000	6421000	We were all like noooooo! It was pretty bad.
6421000	6425000	Loki, can you think of a story? I have one while you're thinking.
6425000	6430000	I don't have a lot of good ones but do you know how old NES is?
6431000	6435000	He had to blow on the cartridge to get him to work and then sometimes the game would just spontaneously reset.
6435000	6443000	Like right in the middle. Yeah, that happened to us the night my friend and I decided to play Super Mario Bros. 3 from start to finish with no warping.
6443000	6449000	Around like world six or seven. Like if something hit the ground too hard, which I think is what happened, I think we dropped something on the ground.
6449000	6453000	And it just threw everything off balance enough so it was like, reset!
6453000	6460000	Noooooo! Everything was ruined and we gave up and moved on. Loki?
6460000	6465000	I don't really have anything that I remember as far as power outages and stuff like that.
6465000	6474000	The only thing I can remember is that I was making a pretty awesome level or game in ZZT.
6474000	6479000	And I had it backed up to a floppy disk and then the whole thing got corrupted.
6479000	6486000	And all that work, it was like a month worth of work and it was just gone.
6486000	6489000	What happened to me on The Sims House?
6489000	6493000	Can we take a moment to remind our listeners of the mutual love we have for the game ZZT?
6493000	6496000	I wish there was something like that again.
6496000	6498000	There's still Megazooks that's still out there.
6498000	6500000	Do they still make stuff for ZZT?
6500000	6501000	Megazooks, yes.
6501000	6502000	Oh, right.
6502000	6503000	The new one.
6503000	6504000	That's amazing.
6504000	6507000	Anyway, sorry Dark Sakura. He said the magic word.
6508000	6515000	I one time spent four hours working on The Sims House and forgot to save and then the power went out.
6515000	6518000	We should have a VOG ZZT contest.
6518000	6520000	I've thought about it. I seriously have.
6520000	6522000	You and I would be the only ones that would enter.
6522000	6523000	Yeah, unfortunately.
6524000	6526000	You know what? Prove me wrong.
6526000	6532000	If there's interest in a ZZT VOG contest, email the show and tell us you're interested and you'd participate.
6532000	6535000	And we will put something together.
6535000	6536000	Alright.
6537000	6540000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to listless tonight.
6540000	6541000	But first, Loki.
6541000	6543000	So, the PS3's been hacked again.
6543000	6544000	Sort of.
6544000	6552000	Basically what happened was a hacker group called the Three Musketeers finally released the level zero keys.
6552000	6563000	And not necessarily the way to get those keys themselves, but the keys will be useful as far as decrypting new firmwares that come out.
6563000	6568000	And basically re-encrypting them in the 355 keys to run on hacked consoles.
6568000	6571000	So, really there's no way to block that.
6571000	6580000	They did kind of, if I remember correctly, they updated the keys on certain PS3's and stuff now where they use like the 0.2 keys or something.
6580000	6581000	They're slightly different.
6581000	6590000	So, I think that's why it has to run on the 355 firmwares because anything newer doesn't use those keys anymore.
6590000	6597000	But, you know, for compatibility's sake they need to have everything, you know, use those keys at some point or something.
6597000	6598000	I don't know.
6598000	6601000	Honestly, it's been so long since I've looked into the hacking stuff.
6601000	6603000	It's, I don't know.
6603000	6618000	But, apparently, this is supposed to be un-patchable as far as they can keep using this exploit to forever have custom firmwares on PS3 and run, you know, new games and stuff like that.
6618000	6621000	So, that's kind of interesting.
6621000	6624000	But, we'll have to see, you know, if that's actually going to happen.
6624000	6630000	But, as of right now, they haven't really released any new firmwares.
6630000	6640000	Although, I have to really, I have to double check that because I think, I want to say I saw something about a custom firmware 4.3 come out.
6640000	6644000	Let me see here.
6644000	6654000	Debug firmware 4.25 has been leaked.
6654000	6656000	Let's see here.
6656000	6658000	What's this?
6658000	6664000	Homebrew for custom firmware 4.21.
6664000	6673000	Update the DMCA.
6673000	6677000	So, what does this really mean? Is this going to be like rampant piracy on the PS3 now?
6677000	6681000	No more than it already is. It just means that they're going to keep, they're going to be able to keep doing it.
6681000	6683000	Gotcha.
6683000	6684000	Alrighty.
6684000	6691000	Well, I think you'd have to, I would say you have to have, I think, a firmware that's like 355 or lower.
6691000	6695000	Which, I don't remember what mine is right now because I haven't updated in a long time.
6695000	6699000	So, I don't think I'm 355. I think I'm newer than that.
6699000	6709000	But, you know, if you have an older firmware then that means that you'll be able to, you know, they'll translate the old ones so that they can run like a custom firmware on those.
6709000	6711000	Or based off those.
6711000	6715000	Well, you know the old saying we have on the show, hackers gonna hack.
6715000	6720000	And, but at least no personal information stolen, right? It's not that kind of hack?
6720000	6721000	Not that kind of hack.
6722000	6728000	Okay, because like, you know, a lot of people were, I think there's some misinformation out there because people were saying, did it get hacked again?
6728000	6731000	Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation got hacked again?
6731000	6733000	So, it's not that kind of hack, right?
6733000	6734000	Yes.
6734000	6735000	Alright.
6735000	6739000	Well, I'm going to get into another story here on a completely different note.
6739000	6749000	This is something that has me very excited and I want to see if this is something maybe a few of you out there can recognize by the music, which I love the soundtrack to this game.
6752000	6753000	Anyone recognize this?
6753000	6758000	Actually, if you played this game as much as I did, you probably heard this song a lot more.
6762000	6769000	It's the music from Shadowgate on the NES, but of course Shadowgate existed on some of the early Apple platforms as well.
6769000	6772000	And they did a version of it on Game Boy Color, right?
6772000	6780000	Well, get this, Shadowgate is being reimagined and it has a Kickstarter behind it to get it funded.
6780000	6784000	This is a reimagining of the point and click adventure classic Shadowgate.
6784000	6788000	The original Mac release was in 1987.
6788000	6793000	Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that.
6793000	6799000	Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, they worked on the original Shadowgate with Icom Simulations 25 years ago.
6799000	6801000	They've started this new company.
6801000	6807000	They bought the rights to the old Shadowgate game and Uninvited and Deja Vu apparently.
6807000	6814000	And also got the rights to the 8-bit soundtrack, which apparently was done by somebody completely different.
6814000	6820000	It was done by a Japanese guy who, I guess maybe in the port of the games over the NES, maybe it was done there.
6820000	6826000	So if you listen to the trailer for Shadowgate, it has a newer version of that music, which is awesome.
6826000	6828000	Let me see if I can play a little bit of this for you.
6828000	6831000	But yeah, they're doing a Kickstarter for this.
6831000	6839000	It's going to be redesigned puzzles and an expanded storyline, but most of the plot devices from the original game will still be there.
6839000	6845000	And like in the trailer, you can definitely see the room with the lake, like you used to put the orb in the lake to freeze it.
6845000	6851000	And you can see the room with the dragon breathing fire at the other end, so there's all of that in there.
6851000	6853000	So very, very cool that they're doing this.
6853000	6861000	They are seeking $120,000 to do versions for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.
6861000	6869000	You can do $10 right now to get a DRM-free, and they're really emphasizing that, a DRM-free download when the game comes out.
6869000	6874000	They are projecting 2013 November for that, so it is going to be a bit of a wait.
6874000	6879000	But I will say this, this is only the second Kickstarter ever that I've given money to.
6879000	6888000	I did donate to this Kickstarter because I really like Shadowgate, and I liked those old Icom games, so I'm really excited about this.
6888000	6897000	I will say this though, I only have so much money. I couldn't do the $130,000 or more, but that did sound really cool.
6897000	6904000	An original Shadowgate card game. That would have been kind of cool, but a little bit out of my price range personally.
6904000	6908000	But I'm sure there's people already, it's already up to $41,000.
6908000	6912000	There's that sound again. Let me fast forward. I want to do this part of the trailer here.
6922000	6926000	So you can tell they're totally ready to do this, which is pretty awesome. There's the Wraith. I remember that from one scene.
6926000	6928000	So you definitely see stuff from the whole game.
6928000	6929000	The artwork is gorgeous.
6929000	6930000	Oh yeah.
6930000	6931000	I would pay for this just for the artwork.
6931000	6940000	Yeah, it's gorgeous. ZOJOY is the name of the company that is putting this together, that these guys started.
6940000	6948000	So good luck to them, and obviously as a fan of these games since I was a kid, I hope they do it. I really want it. Very cool.
6948000	6954000	Let's move on with some more news. One more story, and then we're going to get to Listless tonight. Dark Sakura.
6954000	6956000	Oh, I do have another story, don't I?
6956000	6957000	Yes, ma'am.
6957000	6966000	Well, how about the game Waking Mars? This one is an iOS ecological puzzle adventure game.
6966000	6972000	It's actually going to be coming out to PC, Mac, Linux, and Android on November 6th.
6972000	6985000	It's a revamped version done by Tiger Style Games, and this is going to have high def with voice acting throughout the game and be just a great big step up from the iOS version.
6985000	6996000	But I mean, this is what was really interesting to me is that they specifically listed Linux among the platforms, which I think is great Linux getting more attention.
6996000	7003000	And of course, a lot of people kind of giving Mars attention with the whole curiosity and all that, right?
7003000	7012000	Well, there is that too. But this is a game that I kind of had my eye on to play for a little while, and I just never went back for it.
7012000	7022000	Excuse me, sorry. But it's a game that was supposed to have really shown off just how great iOS could be programmed.
7022000	7026000	And I think I'm definitely going to play this on PC.
7026000	7031000	Sounds good. You have to tell me how it is. I'm waiting for your review before I check it out.
7031000	7032000	Okay.
7032000	7040000	All right. All right. Let's get to that time, folks. It is time to bring this segment back. It's been forever since we've done it. It is time to play Listless.
7043000	7050000	If you've never heard Listless before, what we're going to do tonight is we are going to create the definitive list, the definitive answer.
7050000	7057000	This is a highly scientific process, the definitive list around a topic. Here's how it'll work, and I'll tell you the topic in a minute.
7057000	7061000	There's going to be four of us playing tonight. We're going to have a special guest join us here.
7061000	7066000	So everybody help me welcome to the show or welcome back to the show, Alan.
7066000	7067000	Hey.
7067000	7068000	How you doing, Alan?
7068000	7069000	Good.
7069000	7072000	All right. So Alan is going to be playing Listless with us tonight.
7072000	7078000	The four of us will give our top three answers. That's going to leave us a list of 12.
7078000	7081000	Then we're going to go around the room and each eliminate one answer.
7081000	7085000	It's a really tough thing we got to do, but it's part of the process.
7085000	7087000	That's going to leave us with a list of eight.
7087000	7097000	And then those of you in the chat room will vote on those final eight answers and help us come up with our definitive list of the top three answers to this topic.
7097000	7098000	Here it is.
7098000	7107000	Earlier in the show, we talked about that G4 is losing its last bit of video game programming and that it will no longer be a video game network.
7107000	7112000	And most of us have thrown up our hands and said, I'm done. I'm out. Later.
7112000	7113000	Nice knowing you, G4.
7113000	7120000	So tonight's Listless topic, the TV show that would make me watch G4 again.
7120000	7126000	It could be an existing show. It could be a new show. It could be anything you want.
7126000	7129000	The show that would make me watch G4 again.
7129000	7140000	If you want to give your suggestions in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com in case an answer should get duplicated or, you know, sometimes we just like the chat answers better than our own.
7140000	7145000	Make your suggestions in the chat room and we will read some of our favorite answers from chat.
7145000	7150000	So again, TV show that would make me watch G4 again.
7150000	7154000	All right, let's go around and start building the list.
7154000	7157000	So we will start with Loki tonight.
7157000	7163000	Loki, what is your number three answer for a show that would make you watch G4 again?
7163000	7171000	The brand new Iron Chef series that they're doing, the Japanese Iron Chef, but translated in English.
7171000	7176000	All right. Now, to be fair, the Food Network probably has a lock on this show, but...
7176000	7177000	Not yet.
7177000	7178000	Oh, not yet.
7178000	7181000	Well, I mean, it hasn't started yet, so...
7181000	7183000	All right, that's a pretty serious answer.
7183000	7185000	I want new Japanese Iron Chef.
7185000	7188000	All right, new Japanese Iron Chef. There you go.
7188000	7192000	Let's go to Dark Sakura, your number three answer.
7192000	7194000	Show that would get you to watch G4 again.
7194000	7203000	Well, first of all, I never actually watched it, but I would go for Real Housewives Disney edition, like on SNL.
7203000	7207000	So like an actual version of that sketch from SNL, the Real Housewives of Disney.
7207000	7208000	Yeah.
7208000	7210000	That's a good suggestion. I like that.
7210000	7217000	All right, my number three answer tonight, and I see people saying this in chat right now, so chat and I are on the same page.
7217000	7222000	My number three answer is Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.
7222000	7223000	Yes.
7223000	7228000	Where the contestants who don't do well at the games will actually get electrified.
7228000	7230000	Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.
7232000	7237000	I was going to say Nick Arcade, but that wouldn't make sense, because it's Nick Arcade.
7240000	7246000	All right, so so far we have new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, and Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.
7246000	7252000	Alan, what would be the number three answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again?
7254000	7260000	A documentary special. We're responsible for Olivia Munn, and we're very, very sorry.
7260000	7262000	A five-hour apology special.
7262000	7270000	Good answer. I'm going to shorten that a little bit to Olivia Munn apology special.
7270000	7277000	Now, that would only be one movie, unfortunately, or a miniseries. It could be like a miniseries.
7277000	7282000	And what things about Olivia Munn should be apologized for?
7282000	7284000	Have you seen her face?
7284000	7289000	Wow, that's cold. You are cold.
7289000	7298000	All right, so so far we have new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo, and Olivia Munn apology special.
7300000	7304000	Deanna Allers, look at her and go, girl, you need to check yourself.
7308000	7312000	All right, Loki, what is your number two pick for the list?
7312000	7314000	The screensavers.
7315000	7318000	So just bring back the frickin' screensavers.
7318000	7322000	That would give me the watch. That network, yeah.
7322000	7326000	Just exactly the way it was. Don't fucking put new people in it.
7326000	7328000	Like Leo Laporte, Alex Albrecht.
7328000	7331000	Everybody that was in there. Do it the same way you did it.
7331000	7335000	Kevin Rose, Dig Didn't Work Out So Well, Get Him Back Too.
7335000	7337000	All right, there you go.
7337000	7340000	Dark Sakura, your number two answer.
7340000	7345000	My number two answer is Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.
7352000	7354000	Because Glow was awesome.
7354000	7357000	You want Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.
7357000	7360000	I was addicted to Glow when I was a kid. It was a good show.
7360000	7362000	Oh, this was an old show?
7363000	7369000	Back in the day, I had Godiva, the woman who wore the skin colored body suit with flowers all over it.
7369000	7371000	And Mount Fuji.
7371000	7373000	Hated it.
7374000	7376000	Glow was awesome.
7376000	7380000	My mom used to let me stay up until 1am and watch UHF and see the Glow show.
7380000	7382000	So I might have to vote for that.
7382000	7387000	Don't you mean USA? Wasn't UHF like the Weird Al movie?
7387000	7395000	UHF was a weird movie based off of the alternative band of TV radio that had channels on it, yeah.
7397000	7399000	All right, all right.
7399000	7403000	My number two answer tonight for a show that would make me watch G4 again.
7403000	7407000	The Days of our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera.
7407000	7410000	There you go. Days of our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera.
7410000	7412000	You mean the shitadel?
7417000	7422000	I can't believe, Dark Sakura, I do not have your support on a Mass Effect soap opera.
7422000	7423000	What is up with that?
7423000	7424000	I would watch it.
7424000	7426000	There you go, see? You would watch it.
7426000	7427000	Extra garis.
7427000	7428000	All right.
7428000	7434000	If Nickelodeon could have 15 as a soap opera, we can have Days of our Citadel.
7434000	7439000	All right, Alan, your number two answer for the list.
7440000	7443000	How not to market something special?
7443000	7448000	35-year-old nerds. They're loaded, they're loyal, they're distracted.
7449000	7452000	Wait, you need to explain this one a little bit while I figure out how to shorten the answer.
7452000	7453000	What would this show be?
7453000	7456000	The whole basis of the G4 channel model.
7457000	7460000	Let's appeal to adult geek, because they have money.
7460000	7462000	They play video games.
7462000	7465000	We're going to put shows on TV that they'll want to watch.
7466000	7471000	They still buy lots of video games each year, and they're not watching this yet.
7471000	7473000	We're confused.
7474000	7478000	I shortened that to 35-year-old nerd special. Does that work?
7478000	7481000	By the way, you and I turn 35 next year. I just want to point that out.
7482000	7483000	There's something sad?
7483000	7484000	What?
7484000	7486000	My brother, Phillip, yesterday turned 30.
7487000	7489000	Well, on the 26th, sorry. The other day.
7489000	7493000	All right, so, so far, we have on the list new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney,
7493000	7498000	Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screen Savers,
7498000	7504000	Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of our Citadel Mass Effect soap opera, and 35-year-old nerd special.
7504000	7506000	It is time. The number one answer.
7506000	7510000	The number one thing that would most make you watch G4.
7510000	7511000	Loki.
7511000	7515000	Well, I mean, if they're going to compete with Spike, then really there's only one choice,
7515000	7519000	and that is big-breasted bikini car wash.
7523000	7527000	And how exactly would big-breasted bikini car wash be a show?
7527000	7534000	It's just women washing cars and sudsing up each other with large breasts.
7536000	7540000	And would Loki get to be a special correspondent that motorboats the boobies?
7540000	7543000	I'll be the host. I'll be doing the play-by-play.
7545000	7547000	Nelly will get to motorboat the boobies.
7549000	7550000	I would love-
7550000	7553000	Or you can just have me, like, you know, in the beginning of each episode,
7553000	7557000	I'll drive up the car, honk the horn, kind of smile at the camera, and-
7557000	7559000	I would love you and your wife to host a show,
7559000	7561000	because your wife would just walk up to the ladies and be like,
7561000	7564000	how did you let your boobies get so big?
7566000	7568000	You have really big areolas.
7570000	7572000	All right. Dark software.
7572000	7575000	No, no, no. That's just- that's just shameful.
7575000	7577000	I mean, they're not going to be topless.
7577000	7581000	I mean, that could be- that could be the whole web series, but, you know.
7581000	7583000	The unrated Blu-ray.
7583000	7586000	I'm finding topless car wash, too, but, you know.
7586000	7587000	All right, big breasts.
7587000	7590000	I guess it doesn't say- well, they could start off with bikinis.
7590000	7593000	All right, really. But then we're getting the Playboy content there.
7593000	7595000	We don't want to infringe on the other rights.
7595000	7598000	I'm surprised you didn't do World Series of strip poker.
7598000	7600000	That's where I thought you'd be going. All right.
7600000	7601000	No one wants to watch poker.
7603000	7604000	Dark Sakura.
7604000	7605000	Depends on who's doing the pokin'.
7605000	7607000	Dark Sakura, your number one answer.
7607000	7610000	I would actually watch the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show.
7610000	7611000	If they did one.
7614000	7617000	Because I love watching the Angry Video Game Nerd.
7617000	7618000	So you think it's-
7618000	7620000	I love watching his movie specials.
7620000	7623000	You think it's time for the Angry Video Game Nerd to cross over?
7623000	7624000	I think it's time.
7624000	7625000	From YouTubes to cable.
7625000	7626000	I almost said ScrewAttack.
7626000	7630000	But, I think the Angry Video Game Nerd would be more marketable.
7630000	7631000	Okay, there you go.
7632000	7636000	Let's see, my number one answer.
7636000	7638000	And this is big, you guys.
7638000	7640000	Every single one of you know.
7640000	7643000	That if this show was on G4, you'd be clicked.
7643000	7644000	I am there.
7644000	7649000	My number one answer is Loki's Cosplay Challenge.
7652000	7654000	I don't understand what that is.
7655000	7656000	Who am I challenging?
7656000	7660000	You would basically go around to different anime conventions
7660000	7662000	and interview people that are cosplay.
7662000	7665000	And then the viewers would pick their favorite cosplay.
7665000	7668000	And then the challenge would be that you have to imitate it.
7669000	7670000	Yeah.
7670000	7672000	I don't think I'd watch that.
7672000	7673000	Loki's-
7673000	7674000	I would.
7674000	7676000	Alright, Loki's Cosplay Challenge.
7676000	7680000	Alright, lastly but not leastly.
7680000	7681000	Certainly not leastly.
7681000	7685000	Alan, your number one answer for a show that would get you to watch G4 again.
7687000	7690000	I'm gonna preface this response by saying that I used to watch
7690000	7694000	tech TV back here in the beginning when Adam Sessler, the host, extended play
7694000	7696000	out in front of the Metreon.
7696000	7698000	He's very cute. I'm sorry.
7699000	7703000	My number one answer is Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira present
7703000	7710000	Black Boxer Reef Boner Boxing, a Gaynard telethon to please, please come out of the closet.
7710000	7720000	I just shortened it to Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.
7722000	7723000	It works, right?
7724000	7727000	Alright, even though there was something about boxer briefs.
7727000	7728000	I don't know.
7728000	7731000	Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing works for me.
7731000	7733000	Alright, so here it is.
7733000	7734000	The list as it stands right now.
7734000	7736000	The 12 on the list.
7736000	7739000	New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney,
7739000	7743000	Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special,
7743000	7747000	The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,
7747000	7749000	Days of our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap,
7749000	7753000	35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Big-Breasted Bikini Car Wash,
7753000	7757000	Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge,
7757000	7760000	and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.
7760000	7765000	So, unfortunately it is time to go around and take items off the list.
7765000	7766000	It's part of the process.
7766000	7769000	It's painful, but science is painful.
7769000	7770000	Loki, which of these-
7770000	7771000	Do it for science.
7771000	7774000	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7774000	7775000	There's a lot of them, actually.
7777000	7778000	Sorry, Alan.
7779000	7784000	Let's do the, uh, let's get rid of the Olivia Munn Apology Special.
7784000	7787000	It's a one-time special, it's not a-
7787000	7790000	She is on the Daily Show, she is fucking awful.
7790000	7795000	They are responsible for her and they need to pay reparations.
7795000	7796000	They need to pay.
7799000	7802000	Alright, that's part of the game.
7803000	7805000	At least he didn't eliminate Black Boner Boxing.
7805000	7808000	I almost did Loki's Cosplay Challenge.
7808000	7809000	Alright.
7809000	7810000	You know, it's for the listeners.
7810000	7814000	Alright, and Black Wolf would like to point out they did cut her from the Daily Show.
7816000	7819000	And that's why Jon Stewart is the best person on television.
7820000	7825000	Alright, the Olivia Munn Apology Special is gone, which makes sense.
7825000	7827000	There's nothing left to apologize for.
7827000	7830000	Alright, Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7830000	7832000	Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash.
7833000	7837000	Because, because, it's so cliche.
7837000	7841000	I mean, why don't you have Big Breasted Monster Truck driving or something?
7841000	7844000	Hey, we can have a network based on this.
7844000	7847000	Big Breasted Entertainment, the BBB.
7849000	7852000	Alright, my turn to eliminate something.
7852000	7854000	I am going to eliminate...
7854000	7855000	Oh, this is hard.
7855000	7857000	I really hate to do this.
7858000	7862000	The Dark Sakura, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling's gotta go.
7862000	7863000	I'm sorry.
7863000	7864000	You never watched it.
7864000	7866000	I'm not a wrestling person.
7866000	7868000	It wasn't just that, it was...
7868000	7871000	You have UPN for your wrestling needs or whatever.
7871000	7872000	CW or whatever it is now.
7872000	7873000	But there's no more glow.
7873000	7874000	Alright, I'm sorry.
7874000	7875000	Nothing is like glow.
7875000	7876000	I'm sorry.
7876000	7877000	Will you forgive me?
7877000	7879000	Will you forgive me if Pinkberry is involved?
7879000	7880000	Yes.
7880000	7881000	Alright.
7881000	7885000	Uh, Allen, which of these is not worthy of the list?
7887000	7890000	Last time I did a list list, I would say that I would be the chat room's voice.
7890000	7894000	Because I'm infamous for getting rid of the thing that they most want to win.
7894000	7895000	Like President Cat.
7895000	7900000	So I'm trying to look at what they don't want to get rid of.
7900000	7903000	I'm gonna say...
7904000	7906000	New Japanese Iron Chef.
7906000	7908000	Because I don't see that mentioned at all.
7908000	7909000	Alright.
7909000	7911000	New Japanese Iron Chef.
7911000	7913000	It is stricken from the list.
7913000	7914000	Alright, so there it is.
7914000	7915000	You are left with...
7915000	7918000	How did 35 year old nerd specials survive?
7918000	7920000	I don't even understand that one still.
7920000	7922000	Can you explain that one more time?
7922000	7923000	We live it.
7923000	7924000	Don't resent it.
7927000	7930000	Rob, don't dream it.
7930000	7931000	Yeah.
7932000	7934000	Alright, let's see.
7934000	7936000	Some of the comments from the chat room.
7936000	7941000	Some of the answers from our chat room that did not make the cut.
7941000	7947000	Shane kind of was onto something because Shane suggested hot guys playing games in underwear.
7947000	7950000	And you sort of did do that one, right?
7950000	7951000	There you go.
7951000	7952000	Let's see.
7952000	7957000	Tigerclaw says when G4 gets syndicated episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.
7957000	7960000	Stan says the late show with GLaDOS.
7960000	7963000	Taiki says Clippy B's Drag Race.
7964000	7967000	Virtual Phil says RuPaul's PVP Bloodbath.
7971000	7976000	A lot of folks, Duke Nukem saying Arena, Portal, Icons.
7976000	7981000	And the shows that actually were on G4 some time ago.
7981000	7982000	Alright.
7982000	7984000	So here it is one more time in chatters.
7984000	7985000	It is time for you to vote.
7985000	7990000	Send Rob Roberts a private message with your number one and number two pick.
7990000	7991000	Here it is.
8009000	8010000	There it is.
8010000	8012000	Should it be Black Box or Boner Boxing?
8012000	8014000	I think Black Boner Boxing.
8014000	8016000	But Black Boner Boxing sounds better.
8016000	8018000	It goes back to our reoccurring theme of Big Black Cock.
8018000	8023000	But remember it's really guys in black boxer briefs wrestling with boners.
8023000	8024000	What was it?
8026000	8030000	Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira's Black Boxer Brief Boner Bonanza.
8032000	8033000	Alliteration special.
8033000	8034000	Alright.
8034000	8036000	Send in your votes.
8036000	8038000	Please vote now.
8038000	8042000	Send a private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two pick.
8042000	8043000	Alright.
8043000	8047000	And while we do that it is time to go to the mailbag.
8047000	8049000	Are you going to read these tonight, Dark Soccer?
8049000	8050000	Or do I need to?
8050000	8051000	Please do.
8051000	8053000	My voice is actually going.
8053000	8057000	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeloungeradio.com.
8057000	8060000	And we pick some of our favorites to read here on air.
8060000	8063000	Except I haven't pulled up the mailbag yet.
8063000	8066000	I do have it up so I'll just go ahead and do it.
8066000	8067000	Wait.
8067000	8068000	I'm there.
8068000	8069000	I'm there.
8069000	8070000	Do you want to do?
8070000	8071000	Okay.
8071000	8072000	Never mind.
8072000	8073000	I'm in it.
8073000	8074000	Let's see.
8074000	8075000	Where are we going to start tonight?
8075000	8076000	Were you going to read all four?
8076000	8077000	Yeah.
8077000	8078000	Okay.
8078000	8079000	I didn't know if you'd screen them or not.
8079000	8081000	Professional radio, boys and girls.
8081000	8083000	Let's start with ACHP.
8083000	8084000	Hey OLR crew.
8084000	8087000	I decided to check out a new anime called Aoi?
8087000	8090000	I don't know how to say that word.
8090000	8091000	Aoi?
8091000	8092000	Aoi.
8092000	8093000	It means blue.
8093000	8095000	Aoi Sekai no Chusen de.
8095000	8100000	It's touted as being a parody of the old console wars between Nintendo and Sega with gratuitous
8100000	8101000	fan service.
8101000	8104000	And as far as I'm concerned, it delivers.
8104000	8109000	It tells the story of the small country of Sega fighting against Ninteldo for control
8109000	8110000	of their continent.
8110000	8114000	It's only on its first episode as of this writing, but so far they've introduced a number
8114000	8117000	of somewhat easily recognizable, at least by Dark Sakura.
8117000	8121000	Not sure how massively knowledgeable on classic Sega games Rob and Loki are.
8121000	8122000	Parody characters.
8123000	8127000	A blue haired protagonist named Gear who is super speedy and is trying to avenge the death
8127000	8129000	of his beloved friend Teal.
8129000	8130000	Okay.
8130000	8131000	I know Sonic and Tails.
8131000	8132000	Come on.
8132000	8133000	Give me some.
8133000	8134000	Cut me some slack here.
8134000	8135000	Cut me some slack here.
8135000	8140000	A purple haired sister Nell who is his emotional support like Nii from Phantasy Star 2.
8140000	8142000	The general Hermes.
8142000	8145000	He has colored gems on her necklace.
8145000	8147000	Maybe a parody of columns.
8147000	8151000	The rival lieutenant with little angel wings in her hair Opal based on Opa Opa.
8152000	8153000	Opa Opa Opa Opa.
8153000	8154000	I love the Opa Opa.
8154000	8159000	And a genius tactician Tetraloth who loves sticking a long stick into things to fill
8159000	8160000	holes.
8160000	8163000	I'll give you three guesses on what that's from.
8163000	8164000	Pornography.
8166000	8169000	A picture for the host's benefit.
8169000	8170000	A little picture there of all the characters.
8170000	8171000	Okay.
8171000	8172000	I need to see this.
8172000	8173000	That is pretty cute actually.
8173000	8174000	I'm getting this.
8174000	8177000	I like the little monkey.
8177000	8182000	It's super dumb and has girls clothes coming off for pretty much no reason.
8182000	8183000	That's all you need right?
8183000	8184000	That's classic TV right there.
8184000	8186000	And the main villain has a giant mustache.
8186000	8189000	A sword with a mushroom shaped grip.
8189000	8191000	And he rides a flying dragon.
8191000	8192000	Seriously.
8192000	8194000	Look at how dumb he looks.
8194000	8195000	Uh oh.
8195000	8197000	Oh it says no hot linking.
8197000	8199000	What did you do?
8199000	8200000	Hold on.
8200000	8205000	I got to copy paste this link because it doesn't like me linking it.
8205000	8208000	This is great radio when I copy paste.
8208000	8210000	I'm not going to let you because it's insane.
8210000	8212000	So this is Ali Sekai no what?
8212000	8213000	Hit that since it's from the website.
8213000	8214000	Blue world of what?
8214000	8215000	Sorry.
8215000	8216000	Uh.
8216000	8217000	I don't know.
8217000	8219000	Ali Sekai no Chushinde.
8219000	8220000	Huh.
8220000	8224000	Well I know the first part is blue world of something.
8224000	8228000	In conclusion I highly recommend this anime because it's super dumb and pandering to people
8228000	8230000	who like classic games and big boobs.
8230000	8233000	So I figure it would be perfect for OLR.
8233000	8234000	Correct.
8234000	8235000	It is.
8235000	8236000	That would be correct.
8236000	8237000	Hope you guys check it out.
8237000	8242000	Again it's Ali Sekai no Chushinde and you can watch it on Crunchyroll for free.
8242000	8244000	In the center of the blue world.
8244000	8248000	Cheers AZHP OLR's premier gold star recipient.
8248000	8253000	P.S. there shouldn't be any typos or grammatical errors in this email just for Dark Sakura.
8253000	8254000	Well joke's on you.
8254000	8255000	I read the email tonight.
8255000	8259000	It looks like it was made by someone named Anastasia Shostakova.
8259000	8260000	Hmm.
8260000	8261000	So.
8261000	8262000	Yeah I'm going to definitely.
8262000	8264000	I've seen manga for this I think.
8264000	8265000	Yeah.
8265000	8270000	Because yeah the design looks way familiar so yeah.
8270000	8276000	Alright well it's too bad we didn't hear about that before we were talking about the G4 shows
8276000	8277000	we'd like to see.
8277000	8278000	Alright.
8278000	8281000	Going to our next email which is from Nutman.
8281000	8284000	I just want to give my condolences to Jamie after losing her cat.
8284000	8288000	My dog I had for 13 years just passed away recently and it was awful.
8288000	8294000	We think she had a stroke at some point and she may have had many seizures before we could get her to the vet to be put to sleep.
8294000	8298000	It was terrible and I wish that they would not have been the last memories I have of her.
8298000	8299000	It sounds like Shermy.
8299000	8303000	I butchered the name I'm sure and they did spell it wrong but that's OK they tried.
8303000	8305000	Went peacefully during the night though.
8305000	8309000	I could never talk about it on air like you so massive kudos to having the courage to do that.
8309000	8310000	I think I would tear up.
8310000	8311000	Jamie did a very good job last week.
8311000	8312000	Thank you.
8312000	8316000	I did have a pretty significant sniffle.
8316000	8319000	Losing a pet and that was not the sinus infection either.
8319000	8323000	Losing a pet is something that only other pet owners can understand.
8323000	8326000	I hope you will feel better about this terrible situation soon.
8326000	8327000	Happy face.
8327000	8330000	Well it's been about a week and a half now.
8330000	8337000	And it's funny like last night I was walking back to the bedroom to go to bed.
8337000	8343000	And I saw a shadow at my feet and my brain instantly went to it's Shermy and stepped over the shadow.
8343000	8346000	And I was like wait that's not the cat man.
8346000	8353000	So yeah it's getting slowly better but I still have problems doing laundry actually because that was Shermy's room.
8353000	8357000	Well a good excuse to make Dan do the laundry.
8357000	8358000	Seriously.
8358000	8360000	Alright Redertainment starts this email.
8360000	8361000	Trainer.
8361000	8362000	Hello Podcrafters.
8362000	8366000	Does he have a thing for like Trainer in the Mass Effect games or is this another reference?
8366000	8367000	I need to know this.
8367000	8369000	Alright Redertainment wants to know hello Podcrafters.
8369000	8373000	After seeing Loki's Halloween costume on Twitter.
8373000	8375000	Which by the way Loki amazing Halloween costume.
8375000	8377000	Have you worn it yet or is that for work?
8377000	8379000	Uh it's for work.
8379000	8380000	This question comes to mind.
8380000	8384000	What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?
8384000	8388000	Mine is the kigurumi I wore last year.
8388000	8391000	I might wear it again this year due to it's supreme awesomeness.
8391000	8392000	Stay care.
8392000	8393000	Redertainment.
8393000	8394000	Trainer.
8394000	8395000	Sent from my iPad.
8395000	8396000	For the record.
8396000	8399000	That's um basically the animal pajamas.
8399000	8400000	Is what those are.
8400000	8404000	Uh what is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?
8404000	8407000	My weirdest costumes have always been for my actual cosplay.
8407000	8409000	Um.
8409000	8412000	Uh.
8412000	8416000	I don't really think I've done anything weird for Halloween.
8416000	8419000	I did go as a pirate wench.
8419000	8421000	Which was fun.
8421000	8424000	Cause I walked around with a whip and just started smacking on my coworkers.
8424000	8426000	Well and Halloween's about being slutty.
8426000	8428000	No it wasn't slutty at all.
8428000	8430000	It was just you know the bodice.
8430000	8432000	That was about as slutty as it got.
8432000	8437000	But it was a long skirt and big boots and a whip and my hat.
8437000	8439000	Uh.
8439000	8441000	I tried one time to wear.
8441000	8443000	I was gonna wear my bike in costume one year.
8443000	8449000	But that would have just been cold.
8449000	8451000	Alright uh let's see.
8451000	8453000	Going to the next email.
8453000	8455000	Oh I'm sorry I want to answer the question too.
8455000	8457000	The weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween.
8457000	8459000	When I was in 8th grade I dressed as a bag lady.
8459000	8462000	And I got sent to the principal's office because I hit a kid with my purse.
8462000	8464000	But he had it coming.
8464000	8465000	He was an asshole.
8465000	8467000	He was one of those 8th grade bullies.
8467000	8469000	And he dared to make a comment about my costume.
8469000	8471000	And so I thwacked him with my purse.
8471000	8473000	Like a bag lady would do. Right?
8473000	8476000	He deserved it.
8476000	8479000	What are you? Oh you're sending one from.
8479000	8481000	Oh an email?
8481000	8483000	Oh okay.
8483000	8485000	Except I'm like full up on messages right now.
8485000	8487000	So look at that.
8487000	8489000	Cause I gotta count the votes still.
8489000	8491000	Oh okay.
8491000	8493000	Sorry talking behind the scenes. No one could hear any of that anyway.
8493000	8495000	Jeez.
8495000	8497000	Alright one more email from Flaco Jones.
8497000	8499000	He always emails Horde House.
8499000	8501000	So I'm very happy to hear him crossing over here.
8501000	8503000	Flaco Jones. Hey OLR.
8503000	8505000	I haven't heard anyone else on the show bring it up.
8505000	8507000	And it's getting close to Halloween.
8507000	8509000	So I thought I'd write in and get my review for
8509000	8511000	Silent Hill the Haunted House or Maze
8511000	8513000	as they call it at Universal Studios.
8513000	8515000	I am glad to hear about this.
8515000	8517000	Someone mentioned that to me by the way.
8517000	8519000	Having seen it. Maybe Extover?
8519000	8521000	Cause he saw it. I don't think it was Extover.
8521000	8523000	I think it was somebody else. But yeah.
8523000	8525000	Well anyhow. Since we didn't pony up the money for the front of the line
8525000	8527000	VIP passes. Huge mistake by the way.
8527000	8529000	We were only able to try a couple of the mazes.
8529000	8531000	But the Welcome to Silent Hill maze
8531000	8533000	was by far the best.
8533000	8535000	While it was there to mostly promote
8535000	8537000	the new movie coming out. I really hope it makes
8537000	8539000	a return next year because we will book a trip
8539000	8541000	to experience it again in a heartbeat.
8541000	8543000	Despite the movie promotion angle
8543000	8545000	it also contained elements of almost all of the
8545000	8547000	Silent Hill games. Save Shattered Memories
8547000	8549000	thank goodness. Like Lisa
8549000	8551000	from Silent Hill 1. All the way to
8551000	8553000	the Boogeyman Executioner from Silent Hill Downpour.
8553000	8555000	It also featured appearances
8555000	8557000	from the nurses and Robbie Bunny as well
8557000	8559000	as Pyramid Head popping up multiple times
8559000	8561000	to chase us to the next room. In fact
8561000	8563000	once we were out and thought we were safe
8563000	8565000	he made one final appearance and chased
8565000	8567000	my wife all the way out to the actual exit
8567000	8569000	of the attraction. She was extremely
8569000	8571000	frightened being a huge fan of the games
8571000	8573000	and finally getting to see some of these monsters
8573000	8575000	in person. They also did a great
8575000	8577000	job nailing the ambiance of Silent Hill
8577000	8579000	with the siren off in the distance
8579000	8581000	as we made our way through the line to the
8581000	8583000	flashlights and radio static inside the maze
8583000	8585000	itself. It was a great time and they did
8585000	8587000	a fantastic job. It better be there
8587000	8589000	next year because we can't wait to go back.
8589000	8591000	Happy Halloween Flaco Jones.
8591000	8593000	Well bad news for Flaco Jones
8593000	8595000	the movie came in 6th place
8595000	8597000	at the box office this week.
8597000	8599000	Not looking good for any
8599000	8601000	long term memory but then again if they
8601000	8603000	invested all that money in it
8603000	8605000	who knows maybe they will bring it back again
8605000	8607000	next year. That does it for emails
8607000	8609000	for tonight. Mailbag at
8609000	8611000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your
8611000	8613000	emails for a future
8613000	8615000	week.
8615000	8617000	Meanwhile it's time to get to the FUs
8617000	8619000	of the week.
8623000	8635000	FU to my sinus infection.
8635000	8637000	I really hate it.
8637000	8639000	I hate my voice going.
8639000	8641000	And then my really
8641000	8643000	uneven haircut.
8643000	8645000	I mean I like having short
8645000	8647000	hair but it wasn't stacked
8647000	8649000	quite right so it's a little uneven in the back.
8649000	8653000	Yeah I think that's it.
8653000	8655000	Oh and origin.
8655000	8657000	EA.
8657000	8659000	Loki.
8659000	8661000	FU to my weekly headache.
8661000	8663000	Oh you have a headache again?
8663000	8665000	Yep I get them every Sunday.
8665000	8667000	I don't know where it's from.
8667000	8669000	Sorry to hear it. Maybe I stay up too late.
8669000	8671000	Maybe you're allergic to this show.
8671000	8673000	No it's before I get to the show so
8673000	8675000	it's not even an answer to the show
8675000	8677000	it's just get a headache.
8677000	8679000	Um an FU to not having enough hours
8679000	8681000	in the day because like I'm really like
8681000	8683000	we have not had time to go to the grocery store today.
8683000	8685000	We've been doing so much but
8685000	8687000	that's alright.
8687000	8689000	I shouldn't complain about anything.
8689000	8691000	Yeah you were running around when I got here.
8691000	8693000	I took a 15 minute nap.
8693000	8695000	And then I was like where are Loki's stories?
8695000	8697000	But it all worked out.
8697000	8699000	In fact Loki has
8699000	8701000	another story for us before we get to the skype line
8701000	8703000	at 1877 game OLR
8703000	8705000	or our username on skype orangeloungeradio
8705000	8707000	just yet we'll let you know when here in
8707000	8709000	a moment. But meanwhile uh
8709000	8711000	Loki. Yes apparently the
8711000	8713000	Urban Outfitters is selling unlicensed
8713000	8715000	stuff to the product. Oh my goodness!
8715000	8717000	What?
8717000	8719000	How dare they not
8719000	8721000	license stuff to sell?
8721000	8723000	And all this like really random stuff
8723000	8725000	I mean considering the Urban Outfitters is basically
8725000	8727000	like apparel.
8727000	8729000	I mean it's kind of not really
8729000	8731000	something that I would see them selling.
8731000	8733000	But like they're trying to sell Nintendo 64
8733000	8735000	controllers USB Nintendo
8735000	8737000	or Super Nintendo controllers and
8737000	8739000	like
8739000	8741000	the Supaboy
8741000	8743000	portable game console and one of those knock
8743000	8745000	off Super Nintendo things.
8745000	8747000	I don't know.
8747000	8749000	Not really sure why this is news but
8749000	8751000	we're talking about it.
8751000	8753000	Well cause it's knock off shit
8753000	8755000	and it's um at a
8755000	8757000	major store you know. I don't know.
8757000	8759000	So everybody sells those stupid knock off game
8759000	8761000	you know
8761000	8763000	Super Nintendo Genesis things. I mean all
8763000	8765000	like the indie game stores sell them.
8765000	8767000	And Urban Outfitters
8767000	8769000	that's just weird. That just seems
8769000	8771000	like Sears
8771000	8773000	selling something like that. I mean
8773000	8775000	it's just like who gives a shit
8775000	8777000	that they're selling that.
8777000	8779000	Well I'm
8779000	8781000	gonna go run to Urban Outfitters right now after
8781000	8783000	the show and check that out.
8783000	8785000	Just kidding. I'm just kidding.
8785000	8787000	Alright I got a story
8787000	8789000	for you guys here. It's about a
8789000	8791000	favorite game of mine getting an MMO.
8791000	8793000	But there's a twist to it.
8793000	8795000	Isn't there always? It's a Civilization
8795000	8797000	MMO. Yep. Civilization Online
8797000	8799000	MMO. It's gonna be available
8799000	8801000	soon in Asia.
8801000	8803000	Yep. Fire Access
8803000	8805000	is working with XL Games
8805000	8807000	a Korean studio that did the game
8807000	8809000	Lineage. You might have heard of that game. It's like the biggest
8809000	8811000	MMO in the world. Yes. Bigger than Warcraft.
8811000	8813000	They're gonna create Civilization
8813000	8815000	Online. It is an online only
8815000	8817000	game. It's gonna be in Asian markets
8817000	8819000	soon. Yeah.
8819000	8821000	They're doing Civilization Online. They don't say a whole
8821000	8823000	lot else about it. Just otherwise the partnership
8823000	8825000	there. Not a lot of news about
8825000	8827000	what is gonna be in the game or anything
8827000	8829000	like that. But it's a
8829000	8831000	little weird to me because Civ V
8831000	8833000	you can already play online.
8833000	8835000	So how does an MMO work?
8835000	8837000	Does it like never stop? Is it
8837000	8839000	like an endless world that you
8839000	8841000	can always explore? There's
8841000	8843000	more things about this I'd like to know. And the other one
8843000	8845000	is why won't we get a version
8845000	8847000	in the US? Maybe
8847000	8849000	E3 they'll announce some type of partnership
8849000	8851000	to publish it here locally. I hope so.
8851000	8853000	Cause I'd like to be able to try this you know.
8853000	8857000	Alright
8857000	8859000	that's gonna do it for the news tonight
8859000	8861000	which means it is time to open up
8861000	8863000	the Skype line. 1877 Game
8863000	8865000	OLR. Our username on Skype
8865000	8867000	is OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a call.
8867000	8869000	We'll talk about whatever you
8869000	8871000	want to talk about in the news tonight. Or
8871000	8873000	maybe something else. In the
8873000	8875000	meantime we'll get to Twitter topics at Twitter.com
8875000	8877000	slash OLR or
8877000	8879000	Loki. I don't know if there's anything
8879000	8881000	you want to add here for last minute stories while we
8881000	8883000	wait for some calls. Apparently GameStop's opening
8883000	8885000	GameStop kids stores.
8885000	8887000	Oh I saw that. Alan posted that link to the
8887000	8889000	OrangeLoungeRadio Facebook page. Tell us a little
8889000	8891000	more about this. 80 locations are gonna
8891000	8893000	specialize in E-rated games
8893000	8895000	and it's Evil G Junior.
8895000	8897000	I don't know.
8897000	8899000	It's like a mall
8899000	8901000	type store.
8901000	8903000	Alright we have a call coming in. Let's go to the phones.
8903000	8905000	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8905000	8907000	Hey how you doing? It's Bobby.
8907000	8909000	Hey Bobby. Good to hear from you. What's up buddy?
8909000	8911000	Nothing much. You guys were talking a lot
8911000	8913000	about G4 earlier. Yes we were.
8913000	8915000	In fact we dedicated a whole segment
8915000	8917000	of our show to it tonight.
8917000	8919000	And I didn't dedicate anything.
8919000	8921000	I know. What's up with that?
8921000	8923000	I'm a little conflicted just because
8923000	8925000	of my past and stuff with G4
8925000	8927000	and I'm trying to figure out
8927000	8929000	how I want to say what I want to say.
8929000	8931000	Okay well for those that don't know
8931000	8933000	tell us a little bit about what the past
8933000	8935000	is for you. Okay so
8935000	8937000	for those that
8937000	8939000	don't, well I mean obviously we came
8939000	8941000	from All Games
8941000	8943000	and Scott Rubin but I had met Scott Rubin
8943000	8945000	a long time before then.
8945000	8947000	I met him in 97.
8947000	8949000	And he was one of the people that started
8949000	8951000	G4 after his
8951000	8953000	first incarnation of All Games went away in the
8953000	8955000	dot com bust. So I
8955000	8957000	was pretty much right there
8957000	8959000	at the formation and creation
8959000	8961000	of G4 as an outsider, as a
8961000	8963000	volunteer.
8963000	8965000	Back before
8965000	8967000	back when we just knew it was
8967000	8969000	something that a Disney guy
8969000	8971000	was going to be starting with Comcast.
8971000	8973000	And that's all we knew about it.
8973000	8975000	So I was there
8975000	8977000	when they launched the site in April
8977000	8979000	of 2002 and the network
8979000	8981000	didn't go on the air until for a couple months later
8981000	8983000	I think. And so
8983000	8985000	I was there and I actually was
8985000	8987000	the first forum moderator over the G4 forums.
8987000	8989000	I ran the chat room for
8989000	8991000	about two years. I was on
8991000	8993000	the majority of the shows that were on
8993000	8995000	G4 at some point.
8995000	8997000	I actually have a VHS tape that's like 30 minutes
8997000	8999000	long of every single time I was either mentioned or shown.
8999000	9001000	I never realized that you were actually
9001000	9003000	on the network at some point. I never realized that.
9003000	9005000	I was. As I was the
9005000	9007000	for some of the shows I was
9007000	9009000	like the backup caller.
9009000	9011000	Cause they had a talk show G4tv.com
9011000	9013000	which was hosted by Scott Rubin and
9013000	9015000	Laura Foy and Tina Wood.
9015000	9017000	And they taped
9017000	9019000	they would do a live stream of their taping but since
9019000	9021000	it was a TV show it was like a five hour taping.
9021000	9023000	And so we were all kind of in the audience.
9023000	9025000	And they would take calls.
9025000	9027000	And sometimes I would be the one who would call in
9027000	9029000	and I'd work out with the producer what
9029000	9031000	I talk about. Or I would be
9031000	9033000	the backup if the guy that they
9033000	9035000	wanted to call in flaked out.
9035000	9037000	And so I would have to make up stuff
9037000	9039000	about games I've never played.
9039000	9041000	And act as a caller. Like there was one about Splinter Cell
9041000	9043000	and you know me I would never play Splinter Cell.
9043000	9045000	Right. But I actually called into the show
9045000	9047000	once as if you know it was still me.
9047000	9049000	I mean I wasn't playing a character or anything.
9049000	9051000	Talking about Splinter Cell.
9051000	9053000	It's really funny. I do want to
9053000	9055000	make a minor correction to something you said. Cause you
9055000	9057000	said we came from all games. Which you know
9057000	9059000	that was our previous home
9059000	9061000	prior to this. But you know
9061000	9063000	we had started elsewhere before.
9063000	9065000	So we were around on our own Live 365
9065000	9067000	thing when G4 started. So
9067000	9069000	we were those viewers out there that was kind of
9069000	9071000	a little critical and cynical of what was going on
9071000	9073000	on G4 television. But admittedly
9073000	9075000	I was also
9075000	9077000	critical and cynical cause I left.
9077000	9079000	You know and it was
9079000	9081000	basically I mean everybody. And it's kind of funny
9081000	9083000	because my version of G4 is different from
9083000	9085000	other people's version of G4. Because
9085000	9087000	I stopped my
9087000	9089000	involvement with G4 about the same time Scott
9089000	9091000	did which was after the tech. Right after the tech TV
9091000	9093000	merger. Because I didn't like the way they handled
9093000	9095000	it. And to a lot of people when they say
9095000	9097000	oh G4 they think the screen savers.
9097000	9099000	They think call for help. They think X-Play.
9099000	9101000	That wasn't G4.
9101000	9103000	That was tech TV.
9103000	9105000	You know the G4 that I remember was
9105000	9107000	mostly you know like
9107000	9109000	G4tv.com and Icons and
9109000	9111000	Cinematech and Pulse and Portal and
9111000	9113000	and all these games. Arena
9113000	9115000	and all those
9115000	9117000	and they were
9117000	9119000	they had some great ideas. The execution was lacking
9119000	9121000	just because of budget. But they didn't give
9121000	9123000	them a chance to actually get the budget.
9123000	9125000	For any of those shows.
9125000	9127000	Huh.
9127000	9129000	I remember Pringles Presents
9129000	9131000	Yeah. That was cheat.
9131000	9133000	Pringles presented cheat. But what was interesting
9133000	9135000	is because I actually did get to meet
9135000	9137000	most of the hosts from the 2002 to
9137000	9139000	2004 including the illustrious
9139000	9141000	Will Wheaton. And they all kind of
9141000	9143000	knew who I was. Just through
9143000	9145000	the forum posts and stuff because they interacted
9145000	9147000	some and I would be the liaison sometimes.
9147000	9149000	And a lot of them
9149000	9151000	a lot of the hosts actually did know what they were
9151000	9153000	talking about with video games. Which was the main complaint
9153000	9155000	everybody had about the original G4 host.
9155000	9157000	Is that they didn't know what they were talking about. They were just
9157000	9159000	reading a teleprompter. Two or three
9159000	9161000	of them were reading teleprompter and didn't
9161000	9163000	know. But I could actually have
9163000	9165000	intelligent conversations with the majority of the hosts
9165000	9167000	of all the G4 shows about
9167000	9169000	video games. And that's one thing a lot
9169000	9171000	of people didn't realize back
9171000	9173000	before the merger.
9173000	9175000	Why do you think people didn't get that?
9175000	9177000	Why do you think that got lost in translation?
9177000	9179000	Was that over production? Was that
9179000	9181000	you know and I see
9181000	9183000	TigerClaus in our chat says the G4
9183000	9185000	TV.com show was heavily scripted.
9185000	9187000	The callers couldn't call in and call about whatever
9187000	9189000	they wanted. Is that because maybe they took some of the
9189000	9191000	organicness about it out of it?
9191000	9193000	Yes because they it was
9193000	9195000	basically it was a video game channel being made
9195000	9197000	by cable television executives.
9197000	9199000	So they followed the
9199000	9201000	cable television model. They didn't know that much about
9201000	9203000	video games. They just they thought
9203000	9205000	they knew the way to do it and
9205000	9207000	that's one of the reasons Scott Rubin left was
9207000	9209000	because he couldn't get into their head
9209000	9211000	that they were doing it all wrong.
9211000	9213000	And they didn't listen to him because all he had done is web
9213000	9215000	stuff. He didn't know how cable industry
9215000	9217000	worked. Well right in some ways
9217000	9219000	the original G4
9219000	9221000	was kind of like an extension of the
9221000	9223000	first era of all games right?
9223000	9225000	Yeah and I mean that's why they brought a
9225000	9227000	bunch of people from the original all games.
9227000	9229000	There were four people from the original
9229000	9231000	all games network that they brought over
9231000	9233000	flew to move from New York to California
9233000	9235000	with Scott Rubin.
9235000	9237000	Laura Foy was from the original all games.
9237000	9239000	With a lot of the other the non-gaming shows
9239000	9241000	at pseudo like High Weirdness and stuff with
9241000	9243000	Judge Cal. But Josh Crane
9243000	9245000	and Jim Downs also worked with
9245000	9247000	the with pseudo in the all games network
9247000	9249000	and they became Josh Crane became
9249000	9251000	an executive at G4. He's no
9251000	9253000	longer with them and Jim Downs was a producer
9253000	9255000	who was also no longer with the network.
9255000	9257000	So you know none of them
9257000	9259000	are with the network anymore. But there
9259000	9261000	were some people that are still there
9261000	9263000	and I don't know if they're still going to be with the network after
9263000	9265000	the change or what because they kind of did
9265000	9267000	more generic stuff with the TV network.
9267000	9269000	I was going to say is there anybody still at G4
9269000	9271000	that was there at the very beginning?
9271000	9273000	Yes there was one guy his name
9273000	9275000	Derek I'm not going to give his last name but people who
9275000	9277000	probably from the all games era know who I'm talking about
9277000	9279000	he is still there. And
9279000	9281000	he's the only one I really know of that is still there.
9281000	9283000	Wow.
9283000	9285000	And he was also kind of from that
9285000	9287000	pseudo online. He might have been
9287000	9289000	I don't know if he was flown from New York but I know he was one of
9289000	9291000	Scott's friends. So let me ask this
9291000	9293000	I mean you know obviously this news
9293000	9295000	has you a little conflicted because it is kind of rough
9295000	9297000	to see the last remnants of
9297000	9299000	G4 disappearing but these
9299000	9301000	shows were tech TV
9301000	9303000	shows that are the last
9303000	9305000	didn't this all kind of already end five years ago?
9305000	9307000	I think it all well
9307000	9309000	G4 to me ended in 2004.
9309000	9311000	You know and I liked tech TV
9311000	9313000	too. I watched both networks. I watched the screen
9313000	9315000	savers every day on tech TV.
9315000	9317000	And the reason G4 bought you know
9317000	9319000	well the reason I'll kind of expand
9319000	9321000	because you read some of my comments. Basically
9321000	9323000	Paul Allen who was one of the VP's of Microsoft
9323000	9325000	he bought a lot of things and he's the
9325000	9327000	guy that started tech TV because he wanted a
9327000	9329000	cable television network
9329000	9331000	about technology. He got bored with it.
9331000	9333000	And said
9333000	9335000	you know I know you guys are about to pull a profit and pull
9335000	9337000	high ratings you know tech TV was on the rise.
9337000	9339000	He's like but I'm bored. And
9339000	9341000	Comcast is offering money so I want it. And Comcast
9341000	9343000	wanted tech TV because G4
9343000	9345000	could not get on direct TV.
9345000	9347000	They couldn't. Direct TV rejected
9347000	9349000	them. Said that we don't want your content.
9349000	9351000	Tech TV was already on
9351000	9353000	direct TV so
9353000	9355000	that was their Trojan horse
9355000	9357000	and so they became G4 tech TV
9357000	9359000	and this is why they actually did that
9359000	9361000	because they could not change the type
9361000	9363000	of network until they renegotiated the contract
9363000	9365000	with direct TV. So
9365000	9367000	in order to be broadcast on tech
9367000	9369000	TV signal they had to retain
9369000	9371000	tech TV's
9371000	9373000	type of content. And that's
9373000	9375000	why they kept the screen savers and kept
9375000	9377000	some of the other tech TV type stuff
9377000	9379000	and became G4 tech TV
9379000	9381000	and then once they renegotiated the contract
9381000	9383000	they went back to G4.
9383000	9385000	Interesting.
9385000	9387000	And it's
9387000	9389000	funny I told you I was going to tell this story
9389000	9391000	in chat about
9391000	9393000	one of my most famous
9393000	9395000	acts
9395000	9397000	one of the acts that has shaped cable
9397000	9399000	television that I did
9399000	9401000	or at least I claimed to do.
9401000	9403000	And when I say this story I realized that
9403000	9405000	at the time I believed
9405000	9407000	this was true and
9407000	9409000	to his credit the
9409000	9411000	other person played along and told me it was
9411000	9413000	true but looking back I'm pretty
9413000	9415000	sure that my version of events is a little bit
9415000	9417000	different than the actual history
9417000	9419000	but basically back in like
9419000	9421000	2003 or whatever
9421000	9423000	Scott was trying to fight the director
9423000	9425000	of G4tv.com
9425000	9427000	trying to get him to do some more
9427000	9429000	hardcore gaming segments that the director who didn't
9429000	9431000	know anything about video games he knew about cable TV
9431000	9433000	didn't want to do. And so he really
9433000	9435000	wanted to hire a production assistant
9435000	9437000	to kind of give
9437000	9439000	him help him get leverage over the director
9439000	9441000	so now it's two voices instead of just one
9441000	9443000	because G4tv.com really
9443000	9445000	devolved into what
9445000	9447000	can we make Laura Foy and Tina Wood do
9447000	9449000	to appease the teenager
9449000	9451000	male demographic.
9451000	9453000	And that's why they did the
9453000	9455000	challenges that had the
9455000	9457000	gross
9457000	9459000	ending to it or whatever
9459000	9461000	you know the humiliation at the end.
9461000	9463000	And
9463000	9465000	in comes chat one day is
9465000	9467000	somebody that I kind of remember from the old
9467000	9469000	pseudo days from Shooters which is one of the old
9469000	9471000	all games network shows. Captain Emmie
9471000	9473000	and he was sitting there
9473000	9475000	talking about how he didn't like
9475000	9477000	where he was. He was working at some public access
9477000	9479000	station or some real low TV station
9479000	9481000	and I knew Scott was working for
9481000	9483000	a production assistant
9483000	9485000	but Scott actually told me
9485000	9487000	he didn't want me to come out for it because I wouldn't
9487000	9489000	get paid enough. But I
9489000	9491000	told Captain Emmie that
9491000	9493000	hey Scott's looking for this guy
9493000	9495000	for a production assistant. He's like
9495000	9497000	oh no I couldn't ask him for that. I'm like no really
9497000	9499000	he's looking for
9499000	9501000	somebody to fill the job.
9501000	9503000	And Scott comes into chat and I'm like
9503000	9505000	hey Scott Captain Emmie's looking for a job
9505000	9507000	and it was oh really.
9507000	9509000	And
9509000	9511000	to kind of
9511000	9513000	tie the story together Captain Emmie was the
9513000	9515000	screen name for Kevin Pereira.
9515000	9517000	So I
9517000	9519000	believed for the longest time and to Kevin's credit
9519000	9521000	he agreed with me that I got him
9521000	9523000	his job at G4.
9523000	9525000	Now the real version is more
9525000	9527000	like Kevin knew the job was open
9527000	9529000	he was coming into chat just to see when Scott was
9529000	9531000	around to talk to him about it. But he
9531000	9533000	you know he'll
9533000	9535000	play along and say that I kind of
9535000	9537000	pointed him in the direction when I think that was the direction
9537000	9539000	he was going in anyway. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
9539000	9541000	So
9541000	9543000	yeah in some
9543000	9545000	ways you can blame me for Kevin even being hired
9545000	9547000	at G4 in the first place.
9547000	9549000	Or maybe thank you in the case of Alan
9549000	9551000	and what he said during the list list segment tonight.
9551000	9553000	So there you go.
9553000	9555000	But
9555000	9557000	I mean the shows I liked on G4
9557000	9559000	the most were actually not produced by G4.
9559000	9561000	Electric Playground and
9561000	9563000	Judgment Day were from Greedy Productions. They're still
9563000	9565000	in business. Electric Playground is actually the
9565000	9567000	longest running television show about
9567000	9569000	video games in the world. It's been
9569000	9571000	running since 1995.
9571000	9573000	And they actually recently went daily
9573000	9575000	but they're mainly Canadian.
9575000	9577000	They're produced up in Vancouver and
9577000	9579000	Judgment Day is actually just a re-skinning of
9579000	9581000	their show Reviews on the Run. G4
9581000	9583000	wanted something specific and
9583000	9585000	so they took the Reviews on the Run footage
9585000	9587000	that had Victor Lucas and Tommy Tallarico
9587000	9589000	and put G4 graphics around it.
9589000	9591000	And that's all they did. So in Canada it was Reviews
9591000	9593000	on the Run. Here it was Judgment Day.
9593000	9595000	They still do Reviews on the Run and what's funny is
9595000	9597000	Tommy Tallarico no longer
9597000	9599000	does any of that stuff because he's so busy with video games live.
9599000	9601000	But one of the
9601000	9603000	people that does Reviews on Reviews on the Run
9603000	9605000	was kind of like me in
9605000	9607000	the same sense that we were in the G4
9607000	9609000	forums together and
9609000	9611000	kind of attached to specific shows
9611000	9613000	and personalities. I attach to Scott Rubin. I do
9613000	9615000	podcasts. This guy
9615000	9617000	Jose Sanchez, he went by Fubar,
9617000	9619000	attached himself to Victor Lucas and
9619000	9621000	he now is one of the hosts on Reviews on the Run. He was
9621000	9623000	a production assistant there for Greedy
9623000	9625000	for the longest time and worked his way up.
9625000	9627000	Wow. That's awesome.
9627000	9629000	Huh.
9629000	9631000	Well, it's been story time with
9631000	9633000	Bobby Blackwolf but this is good.
9633000	9635000	It's kind of neat to hear the history and I hope you do
9635000	9637000	end up doing your piece for VOG Network
9637000	9639000	about kind of reflecting on it.
9639000	9641000	Gosh, I'm
9641000	9643000	trying to think what else to ask you with this thing but
9643000	9645000	do you think there is a future
9645000	9647000	for video game
9647000	9649000	television? Do you think
9649000	9651000	somebody else we don't know of
9651000	9653000	yet could come in and start a video game
9653000	9655000	network or is it just, you know what, no
9655000	9657000	video game stuff is always going to be on the internet.
9657000	9659000	This is something always internet based.
9659000	9661000	There's only one way
9661000	9663000	I think and
9663000	9665000	it's going to, basically I'm looking to
9665000	9667000	Korea. The only way that we can
9667000	9669000	get a video game channel is if
9669000	9671000	esports takes off in America the way it's taken off
9671000	9673000	in Korea. That's the
9673000	9675000	only way I think it'll happen. I don't think we're going to see
9675000	9677000	a generic video game network like
9677000	9679000	G4 and I mean G4
9679000	9681000	tried a whole bunch of different things. They didn't have
9681000	9683000	all new shows. They had one show that was a scripted
9683000	9685000	show and it was about
9685000	9687000	and took place in MMOs. It was an early
9687000	9689000	machinima show using a
9689000	9691000	whole bunch of different MMOs to tell this overarching
9691000	9693000	story. It was Portal and
9693000	9695000	they tried stuff like that
9695000	9697000	and it didn't really
9697000	9699000	take off and
9699000	9701000	I don't think anybody has the patience to make
9701000	9703000	that take off but I think
9703000	9705000	with esports, I think
9705000	9707000	if esports does take off, if League of
9707000	9709000	Legends takes off or Starcraft or something
9709000	9711000	we don't know about yet, we may
9711000	9713000	be able to get a dedicated esports
9713000	9715000	channel but that's probably
9715000	9717000	as close as we're going to be able to get.
9717000	9719000	I would see it probably ending up more
9719000	9721000	being an esports show
9721000	9723000	on the Ocho or something
9723000	9725000	along those lines but
9725000	9727000	I don't know.
9727000	9729000	I'd like to be able to see
9729000	9731000	something and hopefully it will be
9731000	9733000	less corporate
9733000	9735000	controlled. I mean I know that's just
9735000	9737000	looking at it through such
9737000	9739000	dream pie in the sky ideals
9739000	9741000	but yeah
9741000	9743000	it sounds like a lot of the crap that happened
9743000	9745000	on both G4 and TechTV were just
9745000	9747000	bad executive decisions.
9747000	9749000	But
9749000	9751000	and I'm going to point this out, Leo Laporte
9751000	9753000	tweeted this week, Attack of the show
9753000	9755000	in X-Play on G4 lasted 8 years
9755000	9757000	that was longer than any show on TechTV.
9757000	9759000	That's true.
9759000	9761000	Because TechTV
9761000	9763000	started in I think 1999
9763000	9765000	and they were off the air in 2004.
9765000	9767000	Good point.
9767000	9769000	Alright well Bobby, before
9769000	9771000	we let you go to take more calls, do you have anything else you want to share
9771000	9773000	with our listeners tonight?
9773000	9775000	I've been doing a lot of interviews lately.
9775000	9777000	And they've been pretty good.
9777000	9779000	And I've got a big
9779000	9781000	interview show next week. I'm not live.
9781000	9783000	But I've got some
9783000	9785000	big interviews. Hotline Miami which is a new
9785000	9787000	indie game that everybody is loving right now.
9787000	9789000	And then
9789000	9791000	MechWarrior Online and Fallen
9791000	9793000	Enchantress. All those interviews next week.
9793000	9795000	I interviewed a local studio
9795000	9797000	about their first person
9797000	9799000	magic game this week, earlier tonight.
9799000	9801000	They're Xavian and actually
9801000	9803000	a lot of their developers were in chat.
9803000	9805000	And I've already gotten an email
9805000	9807000	from them thanking me for it and
9807000	9809000	telling me that it sounds like one of the quotes I said
9809000	9811000	may be on the back of the box in two years.
9811000	9813000	Which would be awesome.
9813000	9815000	Unfortunately I wasn't the one that
9815000	9817000	initially said the quote Dungeon Buster did so I don't know how this
9817000	9819000	works.
9819000	9821000	But they specific because it's a first person
9821000	9823000	magic game and Dungeon Buster
9823000	9825000	in chat was like...
9825000	9827000	It's like Skyrim's magic system done right
9827000	9829000	and I repeated that and that's what they
9829000	9831000	quoted in the interview that they really appreciated hearing.
9831000	9833000	Interesting.
9833000	9835000	Alright we'll see what happens.
9835000	9837000	Well yeah if you're not already tuning in
9837000	9839000	an hour early at vognetwork.com
9839000	9841000	before OLR you're missing out on a great...
9841000	9843000	Bobby's having a great year. I mean not
9843000	9845000	that the other seven sucked but you're having a
9845000	9847000	great year. But I still
9847000	9849000	got snubbed.
9849000	9851000	Don't go there.
9851000	9853000	Did you look at the
9853000	9855000	list of who got nominated? It's a lot of
9855000	9857000	corp stuff. It's unfortunately...
9857000	9859000	And I think the corporate stuff gets nominated
9859000	9861000	because people want to make a complete ballot
9861000	9863000	and they don't know who else to nominate.
9863000	9865000	Yeah.
9865000	9867000	There you go.
9867000	9869000	Bobby you definitely earned
9869000	9871000	a place in our hearts.
9871000	9873000	Thank you.
9873000	9875000	Alright well Bobby I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.
9875000	9877000	Have a good one buddy. You too.
9877000	9879000	That was fun reminiscing with
9879000	9881000	Bobby. We have another call coming
9881000	9883000	right in though so let's get to the phones.
9883000	9885000	Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
9885000	9887000	Greetings Ronald Roberts.
9887000	9889000	This is DJ Ron Ness live from the
9889000	9891000	Brooklyn Studios of anime jam session.
9891000	9893000	Oh my gosh.
9893000	9895000	I thought I heard wind in the background there.
9895000	9897000	Is the storm rolling in?
9897000	9899000	Are you getting blown by Sandy right now?
9899000	9901000	It's raining sideways!
9901000	9903000	What?
9903000	9905000	It's raining sideways!
9905000	9907000	It's go rain!
9907000	9909000	It's go rain!
9909000	9911000	Yes yes yes.
9911000	9913000	Right now
9913000	9915000	I'm going to tell you the same thing
9915000	9917000	I told Travis and Jessica
9917000	9919000	last August when Irene
9919000	9921000	reared her little head up in here.
9921000	9923000	What's that?
9923000	9925000	It's windy as hell.
9925000	9927000	It's a little bit of rain.
9927000	9929000	The shoreline
9929000	9931000	of Jersey has been more or less
9931000	9933000	flooded out but this Jersey no one
9933000	9935000	cares. The
9935000	9937000	anime jam session studios are in
9937000	9939000	zone B which means
9939000	9941000	we do not have to go anywhere.
9941000	9943000	We're also on the second floor which means
9943000	9945000	we don't have to worry about being flooded out.
9945000	9947000	And we have enough battery backups here
9947000	9949000	so if the power does go out
9949000	9951000	we will have internet for another eight hours.
9951000	9953000	It's the important
9953000	9955000	things in life.
9955000	9957000	Alright I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about the
9957000	9959000	hurricane though. What did you really want to talk about?
9959000	9961000	Well
9961000	9963000	there was something else that we
9963000	9965000	did as part of my
9965000	9967000	podcast on Friday.
9967000	9969000	We went to an event in lower
9969000	9971000	Manhattan called Girl Gamers
9971000	9973000	Meet Up New York City.
9973000	9975000	But you're not a girl.
9975000	9977000	No but
9977000	9979000	some of my staffers are.
9979000	9981000	He's meeting up with a lot of the girls.
9981000	9983000	You just went to go get some phone
9983000	9985000	numbers. No I'm kidding I'm kidding.
9985000	9987000	That sounds fun.
9987000	9989000	We'll save that for another time.
9989000	9991000	Nice.
9991000	9993000	Why thank you.
9993000	9995000	But pretty much
9995000	9997000	the point of the Meet Up
9997000	9999000	was to get more girls involved
9999000	10001000	into playing video games to prove that
10001000	10003000	it's not just boys
10003000	10005000	and men that are playing. Girls and women play
10005000	10007000	video games and they can kick as much ass
10007000	10009000	as their counterparts.
10009000	10011000	Absolutely. Right DarkSagra?
10011000	10013000	Right. She said right
10013000	10015000	but you can't hear her anymore.
10015000	10017000	I'm sorry everything's just exploding because the Giants
10017000	10019000	apparently won. Oh.
10019000	10021000	Is that their fourth game? Yeah.
10021000	10023000	Oh boy. That's it then.
10023000	10025000	I'm so glad I didn't go to
10025000	10027000	San Francisco this weekend. I am so
10027000	10029000	glad.
10029000	10031000	To quote Renee
10031000	10033000	and sorry for taking over
10033000	10035000	Ronchon. No that's okay.
10035000	10037000	The city in which I reside has erupted
10037000	10039000	in cowbell car alarm and hollering.
10039000	10041000	Either the Giants won or this is
10041000	10043000	a prequel to some Satan pagan worship before
10043000	10045000	Halloween.
10045000	10047000	Well
10047000	10049000	given that I am
10049000	10051000	a boy and brand new yorker
10051000	10053000	trust me when we feel the
10053000	10055000	pain of not being there and
10055000	10057000	whereas there are the mixed fans that are like
10057000	10059000	well this was really going to happen.
10061000	10063000	Nice. Alright so
10063000	10065000	sorry to derail but what else did you
10065000	10067000	get done at the con? No problem.
10067000	10069000	Well what we did was we
10069000	10071000	got a chance to interview
10071000	10073000	Jen Vargas the founder
10073000	10075000	and creator of Girl Gamer Vogue.
10075000	10077000	The point of her creating this
10077000	10079000	is to prove that girls
10079000	10081000	are just as good as gamers as guys
10081000	10083000	and to break the stereotype
10083000	10085000	and prove that there is a difference between
10085000	10087000	girl gamers and gamer girls.
10087000	10089000	You know the type of girls who sit there
10089000	10091000	and they kind of look sexy with a controller
10091000	10093000	and you know
10093000	10095000	they don't like that.
10097000	10099000	Well you still there?
10099000	10101000	I'm still here can you hear me good sir?
10101000	10103000	Yes I can. What was that last part you said?
10103000	10105000	I said the last part was
10105000	10107000	about how to try to break the stereotypes
10107000	10109000	and prove there is a difference between
10109000	10111000	girl gamers and gamer girls.
10111000	10113000	Ah okay
10113000	10115000	okay so Olivia Munn is not necessarily
10115000	10117000	a representation of gamer girls everywhere
10117000	10119000	I get what you mean. Exactly.
10119000	10121000	Absolutely. And they had some
10121000	10123000	and they had some gamer girls
10123000	10125000	there too in costume
10125000	10127000	talking about their YouTube channels and how they
10127000	10129000	give tutorials on how to play
10129000	10131000	various games how to get through certain
10131000	10133000	action games and they had a
10133000	10135000	theme they were playing we had
10135000	10137000	Gears of War 3 with Zombie Mod
10137000	10139000	Left 4 Dead 2
10139000	10141000	Gauntlet and Friday the 13th.
10143000	10145000	Friday the 13th like the 8 bit
10145000	10147000	NES game?
10147000	10149000	Yes. Yes it was. Amazing.
10149000	10151000	So where can we hear these interviews?
10151000	10153000	Well we
10153000	10155000	were holding on to them because
10155000	10157000	N.A. Jam session is so ever
10157000	10159000	grateful to Orange Town Radio
10159000	10161000	this interview that we did is exclusive
10161000	10163000	to O.L.R. Oh
10163000	10165000	awesome we're going to play that next week
10165000	10167000	so not only will we have Eddie from
10167000	10169000	Money Style with us but we're going to play that interview
10169000	10171000	as well on the show so
10171000	10173000	thank you so much for doing that for us.
10173000	10175000	No problem. When this popped up
10175000	10177000	the first person I thought of was my darling
10177000	10179000	Rope Sean. Awwww
10179000	10181000	Barf. Hey
10181000	10183000	shut up. I brought you vanilla
10183000	10185000	Tootsie Rolls. You did. They're delicious.
10185000	10187000	Talk about barf.
10187000	10189000	Shut up. Since you are the man behind
10189000	10191000	the anime show and I know you have a whole
10191000	10193000	staff behind you but since
10193000	10195000	you are the guy on the show here representing
10195000	10197000	the anime jam session I've got to ask you
10197000	10199000	I don't know did you hear that email about
10199000	10201000	the anime that's Nintendo
10201000	10203000	and Sega and all that did you hear that
10203000	10205000	email? No
10205000	10207000	I did not.
10207000	10209000	We may have to investigate that talk about that
10209000	10211000	on our show coming
10211000	10213000	up on this Thursday. You need to.
10213000	10215000	I'll send you more information. It's available
10215000	10217000	on Crunchyroll apparently for free and it's
10217000	10219000	inspired by
10219000	10221000	old Sega characters apparently.
10221000	10223000	Do you remember the name of it?
10223000	10225000	There you go.
10225000	10227000	Wow. Very good. Good memory.
10227000	10229000	I'm actually looking at the page right now on Wikipedia.
10229000	10231000	Fantastic memory.
10231000	10233000	I linked it myself so I would find it.
10233000	10235000	I just linked it on my Facebook.
10235000	10237000	Gotcha.
10237000	10239000	I will definitely check that when I go back inside.
10239000	10241000	Awesome. Alright well
10241000	10243000	Rama be safe. Don't float away.
10243000	10245000	We will. We will.
10245000	10247000	We're good. We have enough battery backup.
10247000	10249000	We have enough alcohol. We are
10249000	10251000	good to go for the next 48 hours.
10251000	10253000	Sounds good. Fill the bathtub with water.
10253000	10255000	We can't.
10255000	10257000	We don't have a stopper for the water.
10257000	10259000	We are so cold.
10259000	10261000	Oh no. Get every glass
10261000	10263000	in the cupboard and fill it up. Condoms.
10263000	10265000	Alright I'm
10265000	10267000	ending this conversation. Bye Rama.
10267000	10269000	Be safe.
10269000	10271000	You safe drivers good sir.
10271000	10273000	Alright.
10273000	10275000	Thank you so much Rama.
10275000	10277000	And thank you to everybody that called in tonight.
10277000	10279000	Both our callers. Since both those calls
10279000	10281000	were a little long we're going to wrap it up.
10281000	10283000	I'm sorry. But we still got to do
10283000	10285000	some more last minute stories on our Twitter topics.
10285000	10287000	So we're like not even close to being done yet.
10287000	10289000	We don't want to go for 4 hours tonight.
10289000	10291000	So Loki do you have other last minute stories
10291000	10293000	before I get to the tweets?
10293000	10295000	Yeah the John Sisters Twisted Dreams is now available.
10295000	10297000	You can get that on Steam as part of
10297000	10299000	the green light thing.
10299000	10301000	I actually have a token for it.
10301000	10303000	You can download it now.
10303000	10305000	Zynga is bringing
10305000	10307000	Farmville or I should say
10307000	10309000	you know their online stuff
10309000	10311000	into online gambling.
10311000	10313000	Apparently they're planning on doing
10313000	10315000	a slot based
10315000	10317000	or slot simulator based on Farmville.
10317000	10319000	And
10319000	10321000	may expand into other
10321000	10323000	online casino or
10323000	10325000	bidding type things.
10325000	10327000	Interesting. I think they only have like
10327000	10329000	Farmville casino like actual slot
10329000	10331000	machines like real slot machines.
10331000	10333000	I want to say they do have those so
10333000	10335000	not a surprise there.
10335000	10337000	And of course they lost
10337000	10339000	52.7 million dollars in
10339000	10341000	Quarter 3. Probably why they had to
10341000	10343000	fire a lot of people or
10343000	10345000	lay off.
10345000	10347000	Yeah. I think people are just
10347000	10349000	kind of over those type of games now.
10349000	10351000	Although then again I get all these invites for
10351000	10353000	Farmville too so maybe not.
10353000	10355000	Let me do some quick Twitter topics here.
10355000	10357000	I liked this tweet
10357000	10359000	here and I have to admit I'm not
10359000	10361000	informed on the topic very much
10361000	10363000	but I'll try here.
10363000	10365000	Nigella and I hope I said that right.
10365000	10367000	Nigella tweeted us.
10367000	10369000	Don't know if the Florence Gate saga has made it on
10369000	10371000	your radar. Raises interesting questions
10371000	10373000	about games journalism.
10373000	10375000	Now apparently what happened and he links us
10375000	10377000	to something that's on Reddit.
10377000	10379000	And here's the deal.
10379000	10381000	According to what I see on Reddit here
10381000	10383000	Robert Florence just
10383000	10385000	stepped down from Eurogamer because of
10385000	10387000	this column yesterday blasting games
10387000	10389000	journalists and their relationship
10389000	10391000	to PR. And he
10391000	10393000	links to a tweet from the author that says
10393000	10395000	yesterday was my last piece for
10395000	10397000	Eurogamer. Here it is in amended form.
10397000	10399000	I stand by every word of the
10399000	10401000	original piece. And I
10401000	10403000	remember reading this original piece.
10403000	10405000	Somebody linked it to me because it was
10405000	10407000	all around Twitter and I'm like why are all these
10407000	10409000	people joking about Doritos and Mountain Dew? Somebody fill
10409000	10411000	me in. And I remember reading
10411000	10413000	this original piece. Now
10413000	10415000	I'm not sure I understand
10415000	10417000	why this was
10417000	10419000	so
10419000	10421000	flipping terrible. Although I notice
10421000	10423000	there is an editor's note
10423000	10425000	following receipt of a complaint from
10425000	10427000	Lauren Wainwright. Eurogamer
10427000	10429000	has removed part of this article.
10429000	10431000	But without any admission of
10431000	10433000	without admission of any liability.
10433000	10435000	Eurogamer apologizes for any distress
10435000	10437000	caused to Miss Wainwright by the references to her.
10437000	10439000	This article otherwise remains
10439000	10441000	as originally published. Now
10441000	10443000	because I don't have a photographic
10443000	10445000	memory. I don't know what that means
10445000	10447000	was cut from the article. My
10447000	10449000	assumption bolded
10449000	10451000	italicized underlined
10451000	10453000	was that it probably had to do with a
10453000	10455000	particular PR
10455000	10457000	rep or PR firm that
10457000	10459000	was kind of doing
10459000	10461000	some things that might be considered questionable.
10461000	10463000	And you know the whole thing is about
10463000	10465000	basically
10465000	10467000	how tight of a hold
10467000	10469000	does PR have on games journalism?
10469000	10471000	How do you spell her last name?
10471000	10473000	Right there.
10473000	10475000	Son of a bitch.
10475000	10477000	I hit the button on my iPad that takes me
10477000	10479000	back to start. Hold on.
10479000	10481000	Son of a bitch. Alright there it is right there. There's the name for you.
10481000	10483000	Can I zoom in on that? No.
10483000	10485000	Because this iPad is so exciting.
10485000	10487000	So there you go.
10487000	10489000	I'm looking for the
10489000	10491000	Black Wolf says he quoted the
10491000	10493000	public Twitter of Lauren Wainwright.
10493000	10495000	Her outlet threatened
10495000	10497000	libel which is nasty in UK
10497000	10499000	libel laws. They quoted
10499000	10501000	her public Twitter about how she was
10501000	10503000	OK with promoting hashtags
10503000	10505000	to win a Playstation 3
10505000	10507000	and then talked about how she was promoting
10507000	10509000	Tomb Raider and then uncovered
10509000	10511000	that she actually works as a freelancer
10511000	10513000	for Square Enix. Do I need to
10513000	10515000	call back in? Maybe. You have
10515000	10517000	a better memory than I sir because I remember
10517000	10519000	looking at the original article and I was like
10519000	10521000	yeah I could have told you that for a long time
10521000	10523000	now basically.
10523000	10525000	You know PR has its grip
10525000	10527000	firmly on hold of a lot of games journalism.
10527000	10529000	That's why I've always said
10529000	10531000	Indies are the best because
10531000	10533000	even though not everybody
10533000	10535000	you know is um
10535000	10537000	some of these indie gamers are probably the first ones
10537000	10539000	to do the or indie folks are probably
10539000	10541000	the first ones to do these hashtags to try
10541000	10543000	and win a Playstation 3.
10543000	10545000	A lot of times that's where the most honesty
10545000	10547000	is going to come from as well.
10547000	10549000	Thank you Bobby for setting us straight.
10551000	10553000	That kind of sucks that it cost this guy
10553000	10555000	his job though.
10555000	10557000	There's a quote from Forbes by the way.
10557000	10559000	Go join Polygon.
10559000	10561000	That's
10561000	10563000	they sound like a group. They're like a
10563000	10565000	Voltron of game people.
10565000	10567000	That's where you need to be buddy.
10567000	10569000	Apparently
10569000	10571000	uh wow
10571000	10573000	alright
10573000	10575000	she has okay since then
10575000	10577000	Lauren Wainwright has had personal verbal attacks
10577000	10579000	sent to her Twitter which she has now locked
10579000	10581000	her Steam account and other
10581000	10583000	networking sites. Well now that's crossing
10583000	10585000	the line ridiculousness.
10585000	10587000	This is coming from other people.
10587000	10589000	This was actually on
10589000	10591000	Reddit. This is where I'm finding this.
10591000	10593000	I'm just going to read a little bit of it if you don't mind.
10593000	10595000	Robert Florence wrote an article
10595000	10597000	calling out unprofessional behavior in gaming journalism.
10597000	10599000	He then steps down from his job
10599000	10601000	at Eurogamer. That's so he quit.
10601000	10603000	He wasn't fired.
10603000	10605000	Because of this article as he was told he would
10605000	10607000	be sued for libel against
10607000	10609000	Lauren Wainwright since in the uncensored
10609000	10611000	version he outed her for questionable behavior
10611000	10613000	since then she's had
10613000	10615000	personal attacks sent to her Twitter
10615000	10617000	her Steam account and other networking sites.
10617000	10619000	The Forbes article states it only takes a few bad
10619000	10621000	apples to turn a conversation about free speech
10621000	10623000	and journalism into one about misogyny.
10623000	10625000	So apparently people have been taking this
10625000	10627000	really seriously.
10629000	10631000	He was calling out integrity
10631000	10633000	and people were turning it around as an attack.
10633000	10635000	Black Wolf says
10635000	10637000	Ben Kucera did a great article about
10637000	10639000	this whole thing on Penny Arcade Report.
10639000	10641000	That doesn't surprise me at all. He's pretty good
10641000	10643000	about taking these situations and
10643000	10645000	putting them into perspective.
10645000	10647000	I have to
10647000	10649000	admit again the core issue
10649000	10651000	we've all
10651000	10653000	known about that for a very long time
10653000	10655000	but this whole fallout and
10655000	10657000	especially now that part where people were like
10657000	10659000	threatening her on Twitter and shit
10659000	10661000	that's
10661000	10663000	that's stupid and that's unfortunate.
10663000	10665000	What else can I say?
10665000	10667000	Let's see if anybody's published the unedited.
10667000	10669000	Alright.
10669000	10671000	Well anyway
10671000	10673000	let me get to some more of these tweets here.
10673000	10675000	Surtur tweeted us and said
10675000	10677000	I love Bobby Black Wolf and
10677000	10679000	OLR so much and VOG Network.
10679000	10681000	Well we love you too.
10681000	10683000	Dark Sakura sends
10683000	10685000	kisses.
10685000	10687000	Snotty ones.
10687000	10689000	Let's see.
10689000	10691000	SSJ100Matt tweeted us and said hey folks
10691000	10693000	I just want to let you know you guys are keeping
10693000	10695000	me company right now on my three hour drive
10695000	10697000	to Boston. Thank you.
10697000	10699000	You're welcome. Three hour drive?
10699000	10701000	That's a long drive.
10701000	10703000	Alright. Let's see.
10703000	10705000	Tigerclaw tweets us
10705000	10707000	the Mass Effect movie moves
10707000	10709000	forward with a new screenwriter.
10709000	10711000	I know y'all love your Mass Effect
10711000	10713000	especially if your name is Shane or Dark Sakura.
10713000	10715000	So let me read this
10715000	10717000	link here that we got tweeted to
10717000	10719000	from SlashFilm.
10719000	10721000	Apparently
10721000	10723000	screenwriter Morgan Davis-Foll
10723000	10725000	has been hired to make a
10725000	10727000	new pass at the script
10727000	10729000	for Mass Effect.
10729000	10731000	This is the first big movement
10731000	10733000	on the project since 2010
10733000	10735000	when Legendary Pictures purchased the right
10735000	10737000	to the franchise.
10737000	10739000	This writer though he has yet to have a
10739000	10741000	script to produce.
10741000	10743000	Interesting. But I guess
10743000	10745000	he wrote
10745000	10747000	Alien Sleeper Cell and worked on
10747000	10749000	Rescue Me as well as some Happy Madison
10749000	10751000	films. Oh god.
10751000	10753000	Oh god. That's not sounding good
10753000	10755000	so far. But he's a
10755000	10757000	massive Mass Effect fan
10757000	10759000	and producers liked his take after
10759000	10761000	obviously deciding not to move forward with
10761000	10763000	the original script by Mark
10763000	10765000	Protosevich.
10765000	10767000	Interesting. Alright well as
10767000	10769000	long as it's more Rescue Me and less
10769000	10771000	Happy Madison I'll be alright
10771000	10773000	because he actually is a fan of the games
10773000	10775000	but on behalf of the
10775000	10777000	entire fan community do not fuck
10777000	10779000	this up. Do not not fuck this up.
10779000	10781000	Tigerclaw
10781000	10783000	gives us one more tweet here about
10783000	10785000	EA
10785000	10787000	taking a part in American Cancer
10787000	10789000	Society's Making Strides Against
10789000	10791000	Breast Cancer Walk.
10791000	10793000	It's nice to hear about the good things
10793000	10795000	EA did. So let's
10795000	10797000	talk about this. He links us to a story from
10797000	10799000	Game Politics. Team EA
10799000	10801000	took part in the American Cancer Society's
10801000	10803000	Making Strides Against Breast
10803000	10805000	Cancer Walk in San Francisco
10805000	10807000	to raise funds for the fight against
10807000	10809000	breast cancer. EA chief
10809000	10811000	operating officer Peter Moore
10811000	10813000	excuse me was on hand to kick off the
10813000	10815000	event and walked with the employees.
10815000	10817000	So very cool.
10817000	10819000	Good on you EA
10819000	10821000	for doing your public service
10821000	10823000	for an important cause.
10823000	10825000	So there you go. Thank you guys
10825000	10827000	very much for your tweets tonight.
10827000	10829000	Twitter.com slash OLR
10829000	10831000	and yes Tigerclaw I know there's one more tweet
10831000	10833000	but it's a two tweet maximum.
10833000	10835000	Loki any other last minute
10835000	10837000	stories you want to share tonight?
10837000	10839000	Popcap and EA are
10839000	10841000	teaming up with the ADA to
10841000	10843000	give you free plants versus zombies
10843000	10845000	for Halloween. I got an email on that.
10845000	10847000	It's stopzombiemouth.com
10847000	10849000	and
10849000	10851000	it's kind of cool though I mean
10851000	10853000	if you're like trying to be cheap about
10853000	10855000	giving out candy and stuff like that you could be
10855000	10857000	like one of those people that gives out something else.
10857000	10859000	Well they have coupons that you can print off
10859000	10861000	and basically
10861000	10863000	those are they have a code on
10863000	10865000	there that can be used between October 30th
10865000	10867000	and November 10th to redeem a free copy of the
10867000	10869000	PC version of plants versus zombies
10869000	10871000	for PC or Mac and
10871000	10873000	it's all the same code so
10873000	10875000	you can print off sheets of those cut them
10875000	10877000	up and give those out instead of candy if you want
10877000	10879000	to or with candy
10879000	10881000	or with candy
10881000	10883000	and so you can do that
10883000	10885000	if you don't feel like going to
10885000	10887000	basically just go back to the
10887000	10889000	stopzombiemouth.com website and
10889000	10891000	use the code
10891000	10893000	p-hater
10893000	10895000	p-a-h-a-r
10895000	10897000	p-hater
10897000	10899000	one of the
10899000	10901000	plants is a p-hat
10901000	10903000	I think it
10903000	10905000	it could be either way who knows
10905000	10907000	I think it's a p-hater because they don't like getting hit in the
10907000	10909000	face with peace
10909000	10911000	not you know
10911000	10913000	urine
10913000	10915000	so there's that and then of course
10915000	10917000	also this
10917000	10919000	I was kind of talking about before
10919000	10921000	I actually got to read the whole thing now
10921000	10923000	apparently there's going to be some updates
10923000	10925000	to the digital
10925000	10927000	millennium copyright act
10927000	10929000	remember before how it was okay
10929000	10931000	to jailbreak your
10931000	10933000	ipods and iphones and stuff like that
10933000	10935000	not going to be the case anymore
10935000	10937000	apparently
10937000	10939000	it's only legal to
10939000	10941000	jailbreak phones
10941000	10943000	or just say unlocked prior to
10943000	10945000	January 2013
10945000	10947000	basically after that it is
10947000	10949000	no longer legal to do that also
10949000	10951000	it's no longer legal to
10951000	10953000	jailbreak tablet devices
10953000	10955000	or root tablet devices
10955000	10957000	that's kind of
10957000	10959000	unfortunate you know kind of a big step
10959000	10961000	backwards to the whole thing
10965000	10967000	and there's more
10967000	10969000	more websites running that whole
10969000	10971000	disney toy box thing but we already know what that is
10971000	10973000	right I gotta say disney infinity
10973000	10975000	has a great logo
10975000	10977000	it does have a nice logo
10977000	10979000	it's very interesting that
10979000	10981000	you know one of the
10981000	10983000	they have two different components of the game
10985000	10987000	one of which would be
10987000	10989000	let's see here
10989000	10991000	pages not turning
10991000	10993000	correctly one of which
10993000	10995000	was dubbed the toy box
10995000	10997000	and one of course
10997000	10999000	is the actual characters
10999000	11001000	the playsets
11001000	11003000	the playsets of the toy box
11003000	11005000	and of course tying in with Monsters U
11005000	11007000	Cars
11007000	11009000	The Lone Ranger
11009000	11011000	Incredibles, Toy Story
11011000	11013000	and Pirates of the Caribbean
11013000	11015000	and like we talked about last week
11015000	11017000	it's two Johnny Depp movies if I'm not mistaken
11017000	11019000	yes it is
11019000	11021000	he's in a lot of stuff and it looks interesting
11021000	11023000	they've got a picture here
11023000	11025000	the reader looks really
11025000	11027000	different not like
11027000	11029000	you know say
11029000	11031000	Skylanders but they've got
11031000	11033000	these characters and these coins
11033000	11035000	and then looks like
11035000	11037000	boss characters almost like
11037000	11039000	they have that mech thing
11039000	11041000	from the Incredibles so you can
11041000	11043000	team up with Buzz Lightyear
11043000	11045000	and Mr. Incredible
11045000	11047000	and stuff oh neat
11047000	11049000	I don't know very interesting
11049000	11051000	I hope the game's good I think
11051000	11053000	it probably will be I mean considering
11053000	11055000	how well Skylanders does
11055000	11057000	and Skylanders to be honest is a very new property
11057000	11059000	versus Disney
11059000	11061000	characters which everybody fucking knows
11061000	11063000	so
