1
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky, and Loki.

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, October 28th, 2012.

3
00:00:16,512 --> 00:00:18,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the PlayStation 3 been hacked again?

4
00:00:19,034 --> 00:00:20,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Zynga makes some big layoffs.

5
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And could not all Wii U features make the system launch?

6
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:45,286
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this October the 28th of 2012 episode number 479 of our show.

8
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:51,810
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all that good stuff with my co-host.

9
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:56,594
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?

11
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're like sick and stuff, huh?

12
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:00,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a sinus infection.

13
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You better not be contagious.

14
00:01:01,477 --> 00:01:03,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Sinus infections aren't contagious.

15
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:05,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time you had a sinus infection, I got the swine flu.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,921
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

17
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:07,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

18
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm never going to let you live that down.

19
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:09,842
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that's from?

20
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Not eating enough pork.

21
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:12,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi, Tech Master Loki.

22
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:13,344
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you?

23
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:14,585
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned pork.

24
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:14,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

25
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:15,326
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

26
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:15,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

27
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:16,906
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you going to say, DarkSakura?

28
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:21,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, I thought I had a sinus infection, and then I ended up getting like really sick.

29
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:22,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up like...

30
00:01:24,364 --> 00:01:29,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Not having a very bad version of it, and you ended up being like, what, bedridden or something?

31
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So, sorry.

32
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:40,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help it if my immune system is wonderful, Rob, and that everything is just weak sauce when it hits me.

33
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:44,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I am stronger than the swine flu.

34
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:49,587
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join us and talk about sickness, or games would be preferred, but you never know.

35
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:54,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Live.VogNetwork.com is where you can chat along with us.

36
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also check in if you are listening live.

37
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, those are on now.

38
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:02,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, if it's not up by like the first second the intro music hits, I start getting private messages.

39
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Check-ins are down.

40
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:04,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Check-ins are down.

41
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:04,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Check-ins are down.

42
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,255
[SPEAKER_05]: But check-ins are now on for Orange Lounge Radio.

43
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:08,336
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit late.

44
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:09,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Bobby.

45
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,097
[SPEAKER_05]: We are, of course, live after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

46
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,160
[SPEAKER_05]: We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Blackwolf at The Voice of Geeks Network.

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:29,185
[SPEAKER_05]: VOG Network.com Lots of great shows that play on VOG throughout the week, including my other show that's all about the World of Warcraft, The Best Lil' Horde House in Azeroth, or Horde House for short.

48
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:36,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I bring that up, crossover week this week with Girls Gone Wow, our friends over there in the UK.

49
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:40,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were on their show today, and they're going to come on Horde House later this week.

50
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's crossover week.

51
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

52
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Sweeps Month is coming up!

53
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweeps Month!

54
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we gotta pull out all the stunts.

55
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Crossover shows, super special episodes, and at the end of the month, somebody will die.

56
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:55,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We just haven't figured out who yet.

57
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:59,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, um... Also, I feel kind of bad.

58
00:02:59,475 --> 00:02:59,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh, why?

59
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:01,536
[SPEAKER_02]: For crocheting when I'm sick.

60
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:07,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like whoever is gonna get the scarf is gonna get diseases like I'm a European settler.

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,563
[SPEAKER_05]: You should feel bad for crocheting when we have so many things in the gaming world to talk about this week.

62
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I can talk and crochet at the same time, Rob.

63
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:18,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it was kind of a slower news week.

64
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:19,845
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that later.

65
00:03:19,885 --> 00:03:21,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But let me put it this way.

66
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:25,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight we have Listless making a comeback tonight.

67
00:03:25,388 --> 00:03:27,549
[SPEAKER_05]: It has been forever since we played an OLR game.

68
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:28,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just realizing that earlier.

69
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are bringing back Listless tonight.

70
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,390
[SPEAKER_02]: All of my answers are pie.

71
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:33,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you don't even know the topic.

72
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:34,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll get into the topic.

73
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

74
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:37,492
[SPEAKER_02]: All of my answers are pie because of Alan.

75
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:40,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say you got to try Alan's award-winning...

76
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:45,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to escort him to the parking lot to make sure he wouldn't get jumped.

77
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you afraid of severe judgment?

78
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:47,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

79
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:06,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything was okay.

80
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:07,286
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

81
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:12,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us.

82
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkTetsuya pointing out, there goes Loki talking out of turn again, as he tends to do at the top of the show.

83
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:18,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically not out of turn.

84
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,176
[SPEAKER_05]: She talked.

85
00:04:19,477 --> 00:04:19,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked.

86
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I just talked sooner than you were expecting me.

87
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:23,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not out of turn, though.

88
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:25,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, don't give a shit.

89
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:27,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Surprise, Loki.

90
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:28,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise!

91
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:35,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I don't have a lot of stuff to talk about before we get into our gaming weeks and the news tonight.

92
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:37,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we actually give Loki a full introduction?

93
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you mentioned it.

94
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:41,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this guy?

95
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this person that's talking?

96
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to flip the table in a second.

97
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I have missed the 478 prior episodes of Orange Lounge Radio.

98
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this guy?

99
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

100
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:52,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking back my tootsie rolls.

101
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:57,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't figure it out based on the intro and the two people that have been introduced.

102
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish I could deduce who this was.

103
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:01,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me go back for a minute here.

104
00:05:02,355 --> 00:05:03,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me listen to Midi Head again here.

105
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:06,596
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

106
00:05:06,796 --> 00:05:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

107
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm on drugs.

108
00:05:08,597 --> 00:05:09,938
[SPEAKER_05]: The show is called Orange Lounge Radio.

109
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:10,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on drugs.

110
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:19,779
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is!

111
00:05:21,243 --> 00:05:21,704
[SPEAKER_02]: You hush.

112
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:22,887
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I was talking about.

113
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:25,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I will poke you in the eye with this needle.

114
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:33,525
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, for real though, I have a serious kickoff topic tonight, for real.

115
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:44,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, okay, probably the most number, like the highest concentration of listeners for Orange Lounge Radio is here in Northern California, because that's where we are, that's where a lot of the video games industry is.

116
00:05:45,093 --> 00:05:49,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So the highest concentration of listeners of Orange Lounge Radio is in Northern California.

117
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:54,460
[SPEAKER_05]: The second highest concentration of OLR listeners, I'm pretty sure, is New York City.

118
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,504
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously New York's going through a little bit right now with this whole... I don't know.

119
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:01,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Some woman named Sandy is coming to blow everybody.

120
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:03,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's... You're the one that she wants.

121
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:04,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound like a porno.

122
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, hoo, hoo.

123
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,553
[SPEAKER_05]: In all seriousness, if you are in the path of that hurricane, I hope you've taken all those precautions to be safe.

124
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:14,756
[SPEAKER_05]: If they've told you to evacuate, please turn off OLR.

125
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,457
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be there on the podcast feed later.

126
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:18,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And evacuate if that's what they've told you to do.

127
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,801
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have holed yourself up in the house with the...

128
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:30,247
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma's picture earlier was any indication?

129
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:33,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see the picture that Ranma posted earlier of all his booze?

130
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,850
[SPEAKER_05]: He had all this booze.

131
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,131
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, I'm ready for the hurricane.

132
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,323
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

133
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about New York City and think about trying to evacuate.

134
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:41,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Not happening.

135
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:42,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

136
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:43,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they closed the subway.

137
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:44,765
[SPEAKER_05]: They closed the schools.

138
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,886
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time a hurricane hits up there, you know what it's going to be?

139
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:50,007
[SPEAKER_02]: A sneeze.

140
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're right.

141
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:53,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, because you know last night... They lose...

142
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:58,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Momentum Inland I'm more worried about Florida Is that big of a hurricane?

143
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:00,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, even a small hurricane is fairly big, Rob

144
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no matter what, look, we live in California.

145
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,841
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't something we really have to deal with here.

146
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the earthquake thing instead.

147
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:30,564
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're in the path of this thing, I hope you're safe.

148
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,804
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I really wanted to say.

149
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:37,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill your bathtub full of water, buy bleach, get all the bread in the grocery store, and cans.

150
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Ignorant California question.

151
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you fill your bathtub with water?

152
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:49,633
[SPEAKER_02]: In case the water pipes break or you get sewage backed up into the water, you have a tub, which is like what I think

153
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say seven gallons of fresh water.

154
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,993
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put like two drops of bleach in it to purify it.

155
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:58,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

156
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:02,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, even if the water lines are down, you have drinking water.

157
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:03,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that makes sense.

158
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just need to have plenty of drinking water.

159
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you know why you tape the windows, right?

160
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That has to do with the pressure, right?

161
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:14,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Apart from that too, if they actually break, the tape will hold it and keep it from shattering.

162
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, that's what I figured.

163
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:16,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew it was something along those lines.

164
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Also stops the fog from coming in that turns people inside out.

165
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:23,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

166
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,907
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a Simpsons reference.

167
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:25,989
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

168
00:08:26,109 --> 00:08:27,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, look.

169
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:45,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to bring up this story because I had no idea that somebody was already waiting in line at Nintendo World for a Wii U. Isaiah Triforce Johnson, I guess he changed his name to have Triforce in it, he is a diehard Nintendo fan to say the least.

170
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:52,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this is him last time with Reggie getting his Wii, so this guy is no stranger to camping out overnight.

171
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:54,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does Reggie always look like a mannequin?

172
00:08:55,043 --> 00:08:55,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's pretty.

173
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at his eyes.

174
00:08:57,721 --> 00:09:00,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Because his body was ready for cybernetic enhancement.

175
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,804
[SPEAKER_05]: He looks like he's a wax man.

176
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,065
[SPEAKER_05]: He's perfectly groomed.

177
00:09:03,105 --> 00:09:04,406
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a well-groomed man.

178
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:05,547
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with that.

179
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,489
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got to be a public figure for Nintendo.

180
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,810
[SPEAKER_05]: He can't look crazy.

181
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if Doc Brown came up and like, Hi, OU!

182
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,894
[SPEAKER_02]: His skin looks waxy.

183
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:15,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he wax his face?

184
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,776
[SPEAKER_05]: That might sell me OU.

185
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:21,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, look, the real story.

186
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:31,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Triforce Johnson had to give up his spot in line because they basically said the security at Rockefeller Center said you need to vacate by 6 p.m.

187
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had to actually leave.

188
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:42,832
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it has been promised that he may return to his place after Nintendo World reopens when the hurricane has passed.

189
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:43,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

190
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:46,874
[SPEAKER_05]: The hurricane has already caused at least one major disruption.

191
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:50,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, then we should just call this Hurricane Common Sense.

192
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:55,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Because who the fuck lines up for a Wii U a month before it comes out?

193
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:57,861
[SPEAKER_05]: If this thing is disastrous, you are going to feel bad about making jokes about it.

194
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:58,902
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not going to feel bad.

195
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:00,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel no remorse.

196
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:05,837
[SPEAKER_02]: No pity, and he will not stop until you are dead.

197
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:07,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, that was Terminator, sorry.

198
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:15,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand lining up a couple days ahead of time or the night of, but a month ahead of time?

199
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:16,470
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to be the first.

200
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well just stay in line for the next Nintendo system.

201
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Taiki asks Who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B?

202
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Cliffy does have the youth going for him.

203
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:41,621
[SPEAKER_03]: He does.

204
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a lot younger.

205
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:46,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Reggie's kind of trollish, so it's hard to say.

206
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:51,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But Reggie is probably much nicer in person, whereas Cliffy kind of comes off as a douche.

207
00:10:52,624 --> 00:10:56,826
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Cliffy, and I know this is exactly what you wanted to hear on a video game podcast this week.

208
00:10:57,186 --> 00:11:02,768
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about Cliffy is he kind of has that male porn star hair going for him that's not doing him any favors.

209
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:03,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like...

210
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:30,486
[SPEAKER_05]: straight men in porn not always that exciting to look at you know like and he's kind of got that hair going for it and it's kind of I don't know it's it's like some minus points but you're right he does have that youth factor he doesn't look waxy like Reggie male porn stars always make me think of diseases walking herpes uh what up G in chat says Nintendo should just send him a Wii U do you think Mr. Triforce Johnson has earned the damn Wii U at this point

211
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:33,860
[SPEAKER_05]: for staying in line for a month.

212
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo wants money.

213
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:37,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

214
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:44,563
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw on chat says, Nintendo did say he will still be the first in line, which is good PR for Nintendo.

215
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:45,583
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

216
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:49,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have laughed if someone snuck in front of him before.

217
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:51,605
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

218
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waiting here before you.

219
00:11:53,425 --> 00:11:54,026
[SPEAKER_03]: You left.

220
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Ranma, run out there quick.

221
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:04,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there you go.

222
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though we're having fun with the subject and the story and everything, first off, props to that guy for being so damn dedicated.

223
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:13,071
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

224
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:13,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Props to you, sir.

225
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:18,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And second off, for real, we hope everybody is safe in this hurricane.

226
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:19,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Please be safe.

227
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:36,295
[SPEAKER_03]: don't be stupid no props to him for standing out there a month in advance he's actually he's on the payroll for Nintendo a little bit as well he's done some of like events and stuff for Nintendo and actually covered stuff as you know

228
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:38,617
[SPEAKER_03]: A liaison for Nintendo.

229
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:39,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, no.

230
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,361
[SPEAKER_03]: No props for this dude staying a month in advance.

231
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:45,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, cool, you're a dedicated Nintendo fan.

232
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you couldn't be up Reggie's ass a little bit more than you are.

233
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,389
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, cool that you're really excited.

234
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:59,742
[SPEAKER_02]: If Reggie's ass is as waxy as the rest of him, then it should be as smooth... I just... This is starting to go to a place I'm not okay with.

235
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not... Just throwing it out there.

236
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:09,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just... It's just like those people that stand... You know, I understand it's like, oh, hey, it's fandom and stuff like that, but...

237
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,993
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gotta be a line to draw here, okay?

238
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:18,684
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like me, well, I'm gonna stand out in front of this building for a year because I'm waiting for the next Xbox 360 or something.

239
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,046
[SPEAKER_03]: People are gonna be like, no, you're an idiot.

240
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,270
[SPEAKER_05]: You should go stand in line for Breaking Dawn Part 2.

241
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:23,391
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

242
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:25,942
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not.

243
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:27,743
[SPEAKER_03]: You know someone is somewhere.

244
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:28,703
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no one is.

245
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:30,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know why?

246
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:31,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they don't have to do it anymore.

247
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:35,026
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Fandango and places you can buy tickets online.

248
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:40,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, you know, all those people are like, oh, hey, I waited here for, you know, a couple days to get my tickets to Batman.

249
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:41,808
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, fuck you.

250
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I just spent two seconds and went online and got tickets for Batman.

251
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, who's the idiot now?

252
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:52,113
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are some movies where they do the midnight openings where they don't put them up on Fandango.

253
00:13:53,573 --> 00:13:57,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's... I, however, saw Frankenweenie opening night at Disneyland.

254
00:13:58,218 --> 00:13:58,539
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

255
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,481
[SPEAKER_05]: And trust me... Well, can I touch you?

256
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:01,922
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

257
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:03,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I might catch gay.

258
00:14:03,624 --> 00:14:07,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of movies, speaking of movies, and I know we already have movies as a kickoff topic a couple weeks ago.

259
00:14:07,969 --> 00:14:08,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we just see the gift?

260
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,433
[SPEAKER_05]: but I quickly want to say Silent Hill 3D Revelation.

261
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:14,574
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not see it yet.

262
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:15,394
[SPEAKER_05]: None of us did.

263
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,716
[SPEAKER_05]: But I hear it is so bad.

264
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's showgirls bad without the tits.

265
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it is really bad.

266
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes me want to see it more.

267
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, let's do this.

268
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:26,162
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

269
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:26,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week.

270
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:28,624
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to see it at some point.

271
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:29,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow night.

272
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have your people call my people and find a time.

273
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:32,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow night.

274
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,468
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually probably will work.

275
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:35,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

276
00:14:35,348 --> 00:14:35,809
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

277
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:37,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to make sure the other half won't be mad that I see it without them.

278
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:43,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll be going, sniff, snort, because I'll be sick.

279
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:49,828
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, this coming week, Wreck-It Ralph, which I know we've all been excited about.

280
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:54,730
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I heard about that movie is that the flashlights, the shine from the flashlights are in 3D.

281
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:56,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

282
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:57,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right?

283
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:07,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Our buddy Mel, you know, Mel B, the classic DDR freestyler, he, I don't know, he got some type of hookup or passes, won him, I don't know.

284
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:11,306
[SPEAKER_05]: He got to already see Wreck-It Ralph, and he gave it his stamp of approval.

285
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,009
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty important, so we know that movie isn't going to completely suck.

286
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,370
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited about that.

287
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:23,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire, pointing out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Silent Hill has a less than 10% rating on rottentomatoes.com.

288
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when you know it's like really bad.

289
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like 30% bad, it's less than 10% bad.

290
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually liked the first one.

291
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:32,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I did too.

292
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:34,748
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it four times in a theater.

293
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I own two copies of it.

294
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit.

295
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:38,773
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to see this.

296
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:45,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragenator in chat says Showgirls should be remade in 3D Nothing beats 3D boobs, right?

297
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That may be true, but honestly when it comes to Showgirls, nothing beats going to the Castro Theater and watching a bunch of drag queens reenact the scene where she comes out of the volcano

298
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so mad I missed it this year.

299
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,316
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like your reason to live right there.

300
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:07,299
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want a close second to a possible Showgirls in 3D, you can just watch, like, was it Piranha 3DD?

301
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:10,180
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

302
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:11,401
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

303
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:15,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually super upset that I missed Showgirls this year.

304
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:16,683
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always next year.

305
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:19,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Next year we need a huge group.

306
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

307
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to video games and what we have been playing this week.

308
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:26,014
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

309
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass Effect, the first one.

310
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my Mass Effect 3 still doesn't work.

311
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:34,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can kind of get it to run and I've gotten into multiplayer now.

312
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:39,144
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, it's just awful.

313
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've escalated me again.

314
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:41,946
[SPEAKER_02]: This will come up in the FUs.

315
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:44,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've hardly played any WoW, actually.

316
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:48,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You had like hella customer service EA stuff this week, didn't you?

317
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:53,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on with two different customer service reps in their live chat for seven hours.

318
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:54,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

319
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, no offense to you.

320
00:17:16,164 --> 00:17:17,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to speak to somebody in U.S.

321
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:24,795
[SPEAKER_02]: customer service who actually will listen to what I'm saying and not just make assumptions about what I'm saying.

322
00:17:25,236 --> 00:17:29,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you go back and read the log, you'll understand this has nothing to do with my DLC.

323
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:30,463
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with Dan Patch.

324
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:42,848
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about outsourced customer service in general, and it doesn't matter what country it's from, even within the US outsourcing sometimes, is that they usually are stuck to a script.

325
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:51,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And if your inquiry or your question deviates from that script and the things that they are very literally trained to handle, that's when you start to run into issues.

326
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:58,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, what upper management fails to see a lot of the time is that most inquiries go off script.

327
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:01,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked in customer service for how long?

328
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,935
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I was good is because I stopped following my script.

329
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I knew what I was talking about.

330
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just gone on way too long.

331
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:16,600
[SPEAKER_02]: And I finally, they said, oh, we'll do the email service.

332
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had me do a trace, which that I thought was a good idea to see if there was a connection problem on my end.

333
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:25,285
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you right when the problem started, it started with the last patch.

334
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:27,406
[SPEAKER_02]: The patch did something.

335
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:31,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before that, I had no problem.

336
00:18:32,189 --> 00:18:34,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just, ugh, I'm so tired of it.

337
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:42,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, just with, uh, I started getting, I started with the sinus infection yesterday.

338
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It was while I was out running errands.

339
00:18:44,777 --> 00:18:48,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I haven't really felt like playing much in the way of games.

340
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I got home, I was like, I'll want to play as Mass Effect.

341
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

342
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not work.

343
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,001
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels very wrong.

344
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:26,802
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these are all fake people, right?

345
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:27,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

346
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:28,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Liara is blue.

347
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:29,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

348
00:19:29,723 --> 00:19:30,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But, okay.

349
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:38,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the point, though, of believability in what one... Because, I mean, yeah, some people are really into dating children, I guess.

350
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,847
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I... Maybe it's just I'm spoiled by Garrus.

351
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:43,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

352
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:47,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire in our chatroom asks, have other people had the same problem with the patch?

353
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

354
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the only one.

355
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:51,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's been going on.

356
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, people are now referencing my thing on the EA answer thing on BioWare's forums.

357
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:00,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Several people have reposted it.

358
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:05,869
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of us have actually gone on to the Mass Effect Facebook page and linked it, which they've deleted.

359
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:07,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

360
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki, let's move on to you.

361
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:10,711
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your gaming week?

362
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:12,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Minecraft.

363
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:14,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much it.

364
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:19,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was working on some stuff for that, just on the roller coaster that I had there.

365
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:29,021
[SPEAKER_03]: We added some more pixel art stuff in there, have a portion where it jumps into the mouth of a piranha plant, which is pretty sweet.

366
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:39,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, was it, Hidstun was making, he made a knight's, I don't remember what the main character knight is, I guess knight's.

367
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be knights.

368
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:44,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, made knights flying in the air, so that's kind of cool.

369
00:20:47,580 --> 00:21:00,483
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the new patch this week, so I've updated the server and been playing around command blocks, made some teleportation stations so we can hop to different parts of the map pretty quick.

370
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:04,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's about it.

371
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:09,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish more people were on there, because it's usually just me, and then occasionally I'll see people pop in.

372
00:21:10,205 --> 00:21:11,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been pretty slow.

373
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:14,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's a lot of games out right now, so it's not surprising.

374
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually going to play some of those games, but...

375
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:19,507
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know which one I wanted to play.

376
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I got into that weird gamer ADD stuff where I was like, I can play Dishonored and start that game, but I don't want to start another game because I'm already in the middle of Borderlands 2.

377
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

378
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:32,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough.

379
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:34,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's already beaten that game three times.

380
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:35,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he has.

381
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:40,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and then I guess I played Call of Duty a little bit, Modern Warfare 3.

382
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait to play Black Ops 2.

383
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:45,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be nice to switch up to something different.

384
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:46,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um...

385
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:48,798
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it right now.

386
00:21:49,879 --> 00:22:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, but I did decide I finally had it with Mass Effect 3 and Origin in general, so I am done with the PC version of Mass Effect 3.

387
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:01,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I want nothing to do with it anymore.

388
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:14,097
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went back to the Xbox 360 version, which, although it kind of stinks that it's harder to do with the controllers than the keyboard and mouse, I got used to it pretty quick.

389
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:18,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is really sad that I really don't have connection problems on the 360 whatsoever.

390
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:24,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I have none of those loading problems or delays or any of that shit that you get with Origin, and it's so refreshing.

391
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:53,209
[SPEAKER_05]: and I had some characters unlocked on the 360 prior that I just really missed like my Quarian Engineer so Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect lots of that other games though besides Mass Effect believe it or not LittleBigPlanet Vita I played some more of that I mentioned I touched this game a little bit last week but I didn't really play a lot of it I got to play some more of it this week and I'm overall pretty satisfied with it a lot of what I said last week still holds true it's a lot of the good stuff from LittleBigPlanet too and

392
00:22:53,789 --> 00:23:00,282
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I finally figured out why the game wasn't bugging me about the online connectivity when I was playing it last week.

393
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:04,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the game has an online pass and I hadn't put in the code yet.

394
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:13,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, so when I finally, cause you know, you have to beat the entire first world before you unlock the moon and the community levels and all that.

395
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So once I unlocked that, it's like, oh, hey, you need an online pass.

396
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:18,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you need to enter in the code from the manual.

397
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:24,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, there's no manual with little, and I started like, oh my God, did I get, get ripped off?

398
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,402
[SPEAKER_05]: But I opened up the box and there was a code there for, it said, um,

399
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,344
[SPEAKER_05]: The costumes from the Bioshock characters.

400
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:37,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It said, congratulations on your pre-order bonus for Big Daddy costume and all this stuff.

401
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, wait a minute, that's not an online code.

402
00:23:40,332 --> 00:23:42,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I'm going to put it in anyway.

403
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure enough, it was the online passcode.

404
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I put it in and it said, you've unlocked the online pass.

405
00:23:46,478 --> 00:23:47,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, great.

406
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:49,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I didn't think to try that, I would have thought...

407
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:51,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

408
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,202
[SPEAKER_05]: That was LittleBigPlanetVita.

409
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:11,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I do like some of the enhancements they made to the online community stuff.

410
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:16,410
[SPEAKER_05]: You can download levels now, so you don't have to go connect and find them every time.

411
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:22,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the levels online are really stupid, though, but that's to be expected with any creation game.

412
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:26,179
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only going to find a few gems in the haystack.

413
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:55,668
[SPEAKER_05]: but uh yeah it's as far as you know execution it is what you would expect on a little Vita screen and for that it's it's pretty awesome I gotta say something else I played on the Vita it's only a demo and I don't like to review games based off the demo but after Shane's strong words last week about how he felt about Silent Hill Book of Memories you know I had to go download the demo and so I played the entire demo which was a good I don't know it was like the whole first level up through the boss I didn't hate it

414
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:23,725
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's really not Silent Hill like it is a dungeon explorer crawler game with Silent Hill graphics stamped on it and so like if I were obsessed with the lore and really into the storytelling as Shane was talking about on the call at the end of last week's show I could see where that's offensive like having Valtiel be the quest giver at the beginning of the floor some of that stuff's really hokey but I didn't hate it

415
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:42,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it but I would totally rent the game for a weekend just to beat it because I was kind of interested in where the story was going because it was very like you are the main character and you're doing all these things and I liked kind of the haunting memories that were playing on the TVs and all this stuff so

416
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:52,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of into the story, so I didn't hate it as much as Shane did, but I get why people aren't into it, because it's not really Silent Hill.

417
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't play it after that description.

418
00:25:54,014 --> 00:25:54,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

419
00:25:55,015 --> 00:25:58,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I could bring it out here and show it to you, but you'd probably be like, eh.

420
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:01,577
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to blow infected snot all over it.

421
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:04,258
[SPEAKER_05]: All I had to do was look at the back cover, and I was like, nope.

422
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's that bad, but it's not Silent Hill.

423
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the best way I can describe it.

424
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:16,267
[SPEAKER_05]: One other thing I'll quickly say, Smart Glass came out for Android devices.

425
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:20,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure many of you have checked out Microsoft Smart Glass because it's on all the Android devices.

426
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:25,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's where me having an iPhone and Alan having an Android device comes in handy.

427
00:26:25,755 --> 00:26:29,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So we got out his Galaxy 3 and downloaded Smart Glass to it.

428
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was playing around with the Xbox on it.

429
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:35,303
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the big deal?

430
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

431
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:39,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't do anything right now that the app didn't do before.

432
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:43,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to remember the existing app would allow you to control your Xbox.

433
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,014
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you use it with, what was it, Dance Central?

434
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

435
00:27:17,725 --> 00:27:18,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

436
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:21,708
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, it was just, okay, big deal.

437
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:29,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I can swipe on the menu and use, but I'm almost positive the existing Xbox app that was out there would allow you to remote control your Xbox in the same way.

438
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I don't think that's new.

439
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:32,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

440
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:32,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.

441
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:37,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then we're waiting for the TV and movie stuff, but none of that's in there yet.

442
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,905
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, okay, they've got the framework for smart glass down.

443
00:27:40,985 --> 00:27:42,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's see you use it.

444
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:44,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming in 2013.

445
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:45,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Usefulness.

446
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's just like, was it the Xbox Vision Camera?

447
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,562
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the framework in place.

448
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:55,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's see the one, two games that are going to use this.

449
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,946
[SPEAKER_05]: You can make a user icon out of your face.

450
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,168
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about the most that Vision Camera is good for.

451
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:01,749
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I really use that for.

452
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do that with Kinect either, huh?

453
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can.

454
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:03,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, can you?

455
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:04,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

456
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:06,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Well then, so much for the Vision Cam.

457
00:28:07,173 --> 00:28:09,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's... Absolutely.

458
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:10,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

459
00:28:11,694 --> 00:28:16,856
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Gaming Week for me and for our other hosts.

460
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about housekeeping and then we'll get into the news this week.

461
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:20,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Housekeeping.

462
00:28:21,237 --> 00:28:22,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow us on Twitter.

463
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:23,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

464
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:25,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Follow us on Facebook.

465
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

466
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:29,258
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an interview next week.

467
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,559
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had an interview in a while.

468
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,080
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is for the old school listeners.

469
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:44,668
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a show about music-based video games and for a long time we were pretty much exclusively about like the DDR and Beatmania and music game community.

470
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:49,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty surprising to me that in our ten and a half year history we've never had this guy on.

471
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:57,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have had him on like for five minutes on one of the E3 specials but we are going to properly have on the show next week

472
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:15,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie from BomaniStyle.com is going to be on the show talking about what you know especially because we have a news story tonight about like DDR's reboot and all this stuff and I'm not going to spoil too much about that but we really want to get his thoughts on kind of where the music game community is going because I'll tell you this

473
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:43,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie obviously has a lot of love for the Bomani community and a lot of the stuff that he did was a lot of the stuff that many of us dreamed about he had the Uber website he started this record label thing or this record distribution thing where he was shipping out a lot of the music he got some of these artists to come to ASEN he's really been intimately involved with a lot of music gaming like today so getting to pick his brain on a lot of like music gaming and his thoughts is going to be a lot of fun

474
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is going to be a fun episode next week.

475
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:49,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Eddie from BomaniStyle.com will be here.

476
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds super.

477
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:52,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

478
00:29:52,236 --> 00:29:52,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's live.

479
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:54,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys will be able to ask him questions.

480
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:58,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure you're here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

481
00:29:58,478 --> 00:30:01,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That is next week, November 4th, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

482
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:02,619
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

483
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's all I have for housekeeping.

484
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:05,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

485
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,042
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's get into the news tonight.

486
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:09,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

487
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:18,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So, G4 has finally canceled the last two bits of the old G4, which would be X-Play and Attack of the Show.

488
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:20,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And even Attack of the Show is not...

489
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:22,558
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki,

490
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:47,210
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently the rumor is that the channel is supposed to shift towards like a guy network.

491
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:53,632
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying it's like Esquire or GQ channel, which sounds very boring, but cool.

492
00:30:54,293 --> 00:31:00,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder where Cheaters reruns and Cops reruns fit into that, but we'll see.

493
00:31:02,675 --> 00:31:07,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to the news that these shows are leaving, this is all I have to say on the matter.

494
00:31:07,437 --> 00:31:07,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow!

495
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's all, folks.

496
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the scream.

497
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:22,562
[SPEAKER_02]: The scream really does it for me.

498
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:26,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really good particular Bugs Bunny ending, wasn't it?

499
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:30,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad, but it's not like we all didn't see this coming.

500
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:32,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

501
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't... You know what?

502
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:36,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the merger that was the beginning of the end.

503
00:31:36,634 --> 00:31:40,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, without sounding like a heartless bitch, it's really not sad either.

504
00:31:40,617 --> 00:31:43,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but I mean, the biggest...

505
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,361
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

506
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss Tech TV so much.

507
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:11,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, that was the most awesome network ever.

508
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:15,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, hey, G4 sounds pretty cool.

509
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they mixed them together and it's like, whoa, this is like the best thing ever.

510
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And it went so downhill from there.

511
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, I don't even understand how that's possible, but...

512
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:33,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Acidic Vampire in our chat says, Oh, I thought you were going to play a RuPaul's Sashay Away clip.

513
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I'd thought of that.

514
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:35,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time, next time.

515
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:41,686
[SPEAKER_05]: The Sag in our chatroom says, Man, I wonder what the people who have G4 tattooed on them think.

516
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:46,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about that.

517
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:48,109
[SPEAKER_05]: They were doing that on E3, weren't they?

518
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

519
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure they were at one point.

520
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:54,153
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, they better pay for the removal.

521
00:32:55,714 --> 00:33:07,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, look, and here's the thing, especially judging off the Twitter reaction and all the stuff this week, like people were like, I'm so sad that these shows are leaving and man, G4, there's no video game thing on anymore and all this stuff.

522
00:33:07,883 --> 00:33:10,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you guys are... They still have their same presence at E3.

523
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:11,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

524
00:33:13,947 --> 00:33:20,333
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are remembering these shows from three years ago back when you were actually watching them.

525
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:25,738
[SPEAKER_05]: If you all were actually watching them, this news would not be coming because it's all about ratings.

526
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:28,000
[SPEAKER_02]: If they hadn't changed them, people would have been watching them.

527
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, the new guy on Xplay was fucking annoying.

528
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't... See, I don't even... I watched the clip.

529
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,327
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a clip of something.

530
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was about, but...

531
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:39,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking annoying.

532
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:41,152
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy was a total asshat.

533
00:33:43,294 --> 00:33:45,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragenator in chat says, Personally, I love the shows.

534
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:48,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Those shows were the reason I subscribed to cable in 2008.

535
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:52,543
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people kind of reminiscing on the older G4 stuff.

536
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:58,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, you know, it's unfortunate, but the network was already over several years ago.

537
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:01,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when they started showing reruns of Cops?

538
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:02,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

539
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:03,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, come on.

540
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:06,671
[SPEAKER_02]: The first downfall was the merger.

541
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:14,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to really know where the financial status was that made the merger necessary.

542
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:25,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, according to Blackwolf in our chat room, and he was pretty intimately involved in the early days of G4, and he talks about that on his own show, but Bobby's in chat and says, Paul Allen got tired of tech TV.

543
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:34,041
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why he sold it to Comcast even though they were about to have positive ratings for the first time so somebody just threw their hands up and said I'm kind of over it

544
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:35,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious.

545
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people talking about the E3 coverage.

546
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:44,839
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for some people, that's all G4 is now is E3 coverage because they have done the live stuff from the show floor and so on.

547
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So does that mean the tiara goes to Spike TV by default?

548
00:34:48,742 --> 00:34:49,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They've already been doing that.

549
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:54,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Spike TV was live streaming all the coverage through game trailers, their partnership with game trailers.

550
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Weren't they like across the street?

551
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:57,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

552
00:34:57,448 --> 00:35:01,230
[SPEAKER_03]: They were actually in the... Yeah, they were doing all of the press conferences.

553
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,852
[SPEAKER_03]: So Spike had a thing going already.

554
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:05,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

555
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:26,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Spike's alright.

556
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:28,464
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of funny.

557
00:35:28,484 --> 00:35:34,510
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're going to be shifting to this guy channel thing, that's kind of what Spike's already doing right now.

558
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:36,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

559
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not really doing the GQ stuff.

560
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:45,920
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of taking more of the lowbrow route to that.

561
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Shows with big-titted women and stuff like that.

562
00:35:50,123 --> 00:35:51,905
[SPEAKER_03]: A Thousand Ways to Die or

563
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,211
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTrailersTV GameTrailersTV

564
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:26,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of surprised me because, you know, I thought video games were supposed to be like the modern version of movies or music, you know, some new art form.

565
00:36:26,957 --> 00:36:30,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have tons of shows about movies and TV shows and music.

566
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood.

567
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Who watches Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood?

568
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:36,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Old people.

569
00:36:36,924 --> 00:36:38,125
[SPEAKER_03]: People that are old.

570
00:36:38,325 --> 00:36:38,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandma.

571
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:43,729
[SPEAKER_03]: That don't know how to use the internet or just don't care to watch the internet.

572
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:45,531
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

573
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:19,102
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they can get kind of like a quick feed of you know what's coming out and you know what the news is and stuff but unfortunately the gaming demographic a lot of those people are just like internet crazy and so the news travels a lot faster on the internet than obviously these shows can pick up on but

574
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean that they can fail.

575
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:32,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of these shows, if they have... And this is kind of the whole thing with GameTrailersTV is they make a lot of news because they get a lot of exclusive interviews and exclusive trailers and stuff like that.

576
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:35,751
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to see it first on that show before you see it on the internet.

577
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:42,535
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the key is to running a successful kind of entertainment business, at least as far as gaming stuff...

578
00:37:43,115 --> 00:37:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, look at Game Informer, same thing there.

579
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:59,760
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they were able to kind of, other than, you know, coming free with, you know, subscribing to GameStop's card, but a lot of their stuff is, you know, they leverage these interviews and exclusives and stuff, and so they're kind of the source of news.

580
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: BlackWolf wants to point out that Electric Playground and Judgment Day are still around.

581
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know Judgment Day as reviews on the run.

582
00:38:19,142 --> 00:38:21,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Electric Playground is in syndication.

583
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:24,164
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of ABC affiliates on the weekends right now.

584
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:30,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess for me to say that Game Trailers TV is the only video game show left on all of television is a falsity.

585
00:38:30,847 --> 00:38:31,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So sorry for that.

586
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:35,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you could say on all like cable because syndication doesn't really hit cable.

587
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:38,029
[SPEAKER_03]: What would syndicate Electric Playground have anything to offer?

588
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't really give a shit about a review of Halo 2 or something like that.

589
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:41,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

590
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:48,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say it's the equivalent of Ebert and Roper, although I don't even think that exists anymore, but At The Movies or whatever they call that.

591
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:50,536
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what's the point of that show?

592
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:54,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's reviews on movies, so why not have a show that's review on games?

593
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:54,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

594
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:59,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's any different than the Roper or Ebert stuff from five years ago, so...

595
00:39:01,163 --> 00:39:03,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the niche it's filling, I assume.

596
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw on chat says, Old people watch those shows.

597
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Young people, they watch things like TMZ.com for all the entertainment news and gossip.

598
00:39:13,357 --> 00:39:14,959
[SPEAKER_05]: TMZ's kind of trash, though.

599
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:15,920
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I do?

600
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:17,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at your Facebook.

601
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:20,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what I want to know.

602
00:39:20,095 --> 00:39:23,517
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening to... Oh, oh, oh.

603
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:26,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf thinks... Oh, I didn't get this.

604
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf thinks that you missed the point that these are new episodes.

605
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:33,680
[SPEAKER_05]: These are not syndicated old stuff from G4.

606
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,002
[SPEAKER_05]: These are new episodes, but it's like Baywatch was a syndicated show when it was new and all that.

607
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,063
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are new things.

608
00:39:40,743 --> 00:39:41,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

609
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:41,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't catch that.

610
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:42,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you meant to say Halo 4.

611
00:39:42,704 --> 00:39:44,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if it's new stuff, then that's all right.

612
00:39:44,244 --> 00:39:45,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's new stuff.

613
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:46,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

614
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:48,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember watching Electric Playground.

615
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:50,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Tommy Tallarico still doing that stuff?

616
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:51,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so.

617
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:54,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's still him and that other guy, Victor's guy.

618
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:55,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're kind of annoying.

619
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do respect Tommy Tallarico.

620
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:59,692
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, one of them was really annoying.

621
00:39:59,712 --> 00:40:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't remember who.

622
00:40:01,773 --> 00:40:02,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it was Tommy Tallarico.

623
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, but then it's the same thing.

624
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:07,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people think Ebert was annoying or Roper.

625
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:07,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

626
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:08,956
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the one that you agree with.

627
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:10,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure a lot of people think I'm annoying.

628
00:40:11,097 --> 00:40:11,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, that's right.

629
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:17,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see, what, uh, what else is gonna bring up with this?

630
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the TMZ.com bit.

631
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,600
[SPEAKER_05]: TMZ is kind of a trash, trash thing, though.

632
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's be real.

633
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:32,122
[SPEAKER_05]: All TMZ runs is trash, and it's the type of stuff that, you know, gets posted on Facebook, like, oh my god, Lindsay Lohan with the intervention, da-da-da-da-da.

634
00:40:32,783 --> 00:40:33,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised.

635
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:34,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But, real quick.

636
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:35,343
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

637
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:37,684
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is up with her playing Liz Taylor?

638
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:38,324
Ha ha ha!

639
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:45,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just about to ask, so where is our trashy gossip site about video games?

640
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is the Perez Hilton of video games?

641
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:51,500
[SPEAKER_05]: But then Jamie has to go and open her mouth and say that, so I'm thinking maybe it's us.

642
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw Victoria post about it.

643
00:40:54,861 --> 00:40:56,521
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be your trashy gossip site.

644
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,742
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just not enough gossip in the game industry.

645
00:41:01,122 --> 00:41:05,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, we can make up speculative rumors about things, but...

646
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's really anything like that.

647
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,844
[SPEAKER_03]: No one cares about gossip.

648
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:15,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Just daylight rumors.

649
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:19,666
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about nobody in video games cares about gossip?

650
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:20,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you high?

651
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:23,927
[SPEAKER_05]: That is all people ever talk about is gossip.

652
00:41:23,947 --> 00:41:25,207
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they talk about rumors.

653
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:27,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's the same thing.

654
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:29,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did Cliffy B go?

655
00:41:29,468 --> 00:41:30,188
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gossip.

656
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:32,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Cliffy B went to Nintendo.

657
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend who's uncle... Cliffy B went to go bang his wife, okay?

658
00:41:35,413 --> 00:41:36,274
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where he went.

659
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:44,664
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii U is causing all this turmoil within Nintendo and blah blah blah blah blah.

660
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:45,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gossip.

661
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:46,545
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

662
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:14,126
[SPEAKER_05]: So why did we just talk about how Reggie Fils-Aimé looks like a wax figure?

663
00:42:14,606 --> 00:42:18,107
[SPEAKER_05]: There is two celebrity within video games, absolutely.

664
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:23,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start stalking him and find out, Reggie Fils-Aimé double parked today, woohoo!

665
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:30,451
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a difference between the A-list of standard celebrity, you know what I mean?

666
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:35,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a difference between the A-list of geek celebrity.

667
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:45,130
[SPEAKER_02]: where we might care more about like say what Will Wheaton put on his blog because honestly he's a really good blogger.

668
00:42:46,271 --> 00:42:48,631
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of us can really give a shit about Lindsay Lohan?

669
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not raising my hand.

670
00:42:51,532 --> 00:42:54,752
[SPEAKER_05]: She was in Mean Girls and that is one of the best movies ever.

671
00:42:55,132 --> 00:43:01,833
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point, you know, who cares how many more kids, you know, Brangelina adopted?

672
00:43:02,353 --> 00:43:03,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give a shit.

673
00:43:03,173 --> 00:43:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They can afford it good.

674
00:43:04,474 --> 00:43:05,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them raise all those damn children.

675
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't care.

676
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do care, you know, if, oh, well, so-and-so developer left whatever, you know, company, and that means no more of this, or he's going to be doing this.

677
00:43:17,157 --> 00:43:22,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That's shit we care about, you know, and that, and we do care about D-list celebrities like Kathy Griffin.

678
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,621
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

679
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,463
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because, you know, Felicia Day is pretty cool.

680
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, even, you know, the geeks on her friends list were all going, eee!

681
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:49,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know there's people on her friends list that aren't in the whole geeks culture that look at that and go, who?

682
00:43:50,248 --> 00:43:56,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I've met some famous people before, and I was just like, oh, hi, how's it going?

683
00:43:56,812 --> 00:44:01,234
[SPEAKER_02]: And I completely geeked out when Wil Wheaton answered a question of mine on Twitter.

684
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:01,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

685
00:44:02,715 --> 00:44:07,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely geeked out when I met wrestlers back when I was into wrestling.

686
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:13,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had my moment earlier this year because I told everybody I knew that I got to shake Latrice Royale's hand.

687
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:17,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know, I met Latrice Royale and she was gorgeous and all that.

688
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:18,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody's like, who?

689
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:21,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, it's a drag queen.

690
00:44:21,903 --> 00:44:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang my head in shame.

691
00:44:23,183 --> 00:44:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: or my autograph from Kondo Koji or the other Koji, Igarashi.

692
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:34,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the picture that you took of me with him at E3?

693
00:44:34,636 --> 00:44:34,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

694
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like... And first of all, he was pretty floored that my horrible Japanese came across, you know, understandably, but still.

695
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:44,566
[SPEAKER_02]: It was...

696
00:44:45,407 --> 00:44:48,389
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know running into Kojima three years in a row literally.

697
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:54,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Stan in our chat room says everybody's or excuse me everyone's idea of a celebrity is different.

698
00:44:54,073 --> 00:45:00,477
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good point because I really got to address this topic carefully because I really don't want to sound like I have ego.

699
00:45:01,138 --> 00:45:13,366
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was very humbled and thankful that when I went to PAX East a couple years ago I did have people that like came up to me and like I had like a group of people that just came up to me and was like are you Rob?

700
00:45:13,466 --> 00:45:14,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You're Rob from Original Radio aren't you?

701
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:15,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like

702
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:16,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I am.

703
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:17,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

704
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some random guy at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza who wanted to talk to us.

705
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:24,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh my god.

706
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:29,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It was as much of an OMG moment for me as it was for you, I'm sure.

707
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:33,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Where it's like, oh, people actually do listen to this show.

708
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:36,518
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a humbling moment.

709
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:37,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty awesome.

710
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:39,139
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyhow.

711
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Stan in chat says, I made Latrice Royale in PlayStation Home.

712
00:45:45,663 --> 00:45:47,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a lot of weird looks.

713
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:48,544
[SPEAKER_05]: You should just tell him to eat it!

714
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:52,887
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you when it was the most freaky for me was when I went to Alabama a few years ago.

715
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:57,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were doing a tourney in Biloxi.

716
00:45:57,689 --> 00:45:58,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was in Biloxi?

717
00:45:59,330 --> 00:45:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was...

718
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:03,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it was in Biloxi, but anyway.

719
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:08,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I showed up for some DDR tournament on a 5th Mix machine.

720
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:14,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was their new 5th Mix and they were all happy and we'd had it for a while, but it was all cool.

721
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:16,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you're here!

722
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:18,612
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you'd be here, and you're here!

723
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:20,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, hi everybody, nice to meet you.

724
00:46:21,294 --> 00:46:30,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to some 2DX party on a widescreen TV and had to play Karaoke Revolution and

725
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:57,246
[SPEAKER_02]: it was pretty fun but I mean it's at the same time though it's I prefer it more when it leads to you know making friends with people no one cares about Loki I'm sorry Loki but you're a shut-in too you don't go out as much as Jamie and I do true you know what our listeners are my kind of people most everybody else in the universe I'm like don't touch don't don't touch me don't talk to me

726
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listeners, I'm like, okay, you're allowed to touch me on the arm.

727
00:47:03,545 --> 00:47:10,752
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Dave Falcon in our chat room says, I met the nature boy, Ric Flair, in a bathroom in a bar in Tampa and I asked him for his autograph.

728
00:47:10,812 --> 00:47:13,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope he didn't do that when he was peeing because that's a little awkward.

729
00:47:13,354 --> 00:47:14,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's time to talk to people.

730
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:15,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Sign it with your urine.

731
00:47:17,939 --> 00:47:19,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I have his DNA.

732
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:25,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That reminds me of this scene from Priscilla Queen of the Desert about Abba.

733
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:26,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

734
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:26,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

735
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:28,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with the news.

736
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:29,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Ahem.

737
00:47:30,854 --> 00:47:47,202
[SPEAKER_05]: The ESRB, the Entertainment Rating Board, Entertainment Software Rating Board, they are trying to streamline the release of downloadable games doing a new rating service that is targeted for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, eShop, WiiWare, and Windows 8.

738
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,303
[SPEAKER_05]: This service is no cost.

739
00:47:50,564 --> 00:47:55,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a big incentive for people to use this because there's a lot of indie developers...

740
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:58,709
[SPEAKER_05]: and people that don't have very big budgets making games for these platforms.

741
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a no cost service.

742
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:08,317
[SPEAKER_05]: What the deal is, you do an online questionnaire and through this questionnaire you basically self identify the adult content.

743
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:15,249
[SPEAKER_05]: What's interesting about this, the questionnaire will also rate a game in terms of what is shared.

744
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:25,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some new content descriptors in the game that will indicate that the game shares information, shares location, or interacts with users.

745
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:30,489
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty awesome, I've got to say, actually.

746
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:31,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this idea.

747
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:36,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Even as, like, me, I love the fact that I will know exactly which games are going to want to share my location.

748
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:36,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

749
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we see those ratings on Facebook with what they're sharing?

750
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:46,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why it wouldn't work if Facebook games were willing to put it on there.

751
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:47,492
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Facebook, the website.

752
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:53,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, we should rate Facebook the website, but that's another ratings board that'll have to do that.

753
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:54,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

754
00:48:55,493 --> 00:49:24,455
[SPEAKER_05]: apparently this is very similar to what PlayStation mobile games already have going forward on the rating system some are saying that could have been inspired by that so very cool I love that it's no cost let's just hope everybody's honest in those questionnaires I'm almost positive there will be a story in the near future about a game that is missing one of these labels that should have had it but we'll see it's an interesting step forward for now so I can't see how this is a bad idea looking forward to it

755
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:26,277
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

756
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:28,579
[SPEAKER_02]: It's new!

757
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what that means.

758
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:32,462
[SPEAKER_02]: More Bimani.

759
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:40,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Konami has announced that the newest DDR game is just called Dance Dance Revolution.

760
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:47,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And they haven't put a whole bunch of details about it, but they're doing their first location test at Tokyo Leisureland.

761
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:51,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that next Friday, I think it is?

762
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:52,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already happened.

763
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,079
[SPEAKER_02]: They already have the songs.

764
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:53,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

765
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a location test page and everything up now, but isn't it supposed to do all of its updates over the internet?

766
00:50:02,084 --> 00:50:03,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, some of the tweets were indicating that.

767
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:15,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, that I guess they're calling it Dance Dance Revolution because they're not envisioning that there will ever be a second mix or a third mix, that it's just going to be one mix that can be constantly updated.

768
00:50:16,144 --> 00:50:22,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it actually, there's a quote on here from SoInLove about future DVR series.

769
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:29,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked with Usan, and they named this version as just DVR because they will update it, but no new versions.

770
00:50:31,479 --> 00:50:33,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's an English-y post, but still.

771
00:50:35,154 --> 00:50:37,677
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

772
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:54,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw how well that worked out.

773
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:59,082
[SPEAKER_03]: It tanked, and they said, oh, but we're going to provide lots of DLC for it.

774
00:50:59,483 --> 00:51:01,345
[SPEAKER_03]: They provide some DLC, and then it's done.

775
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:02,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

776
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:06,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the game dirt cheap now, and there's no DLC support for it.

777
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:13,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I see that totally happening with this, where they're going to have some DLC for it.

778
00:51:13,227 --> 00:51:18,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what I want to know, is if they're going to constantly update this game, then how are they going to sell new games?

779
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:23,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they just want to make profit off it anymore, or are they going to sell DLC to arcades?

780
00:51:23,694 --> 00:51:28,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to have some arcades that have these extra songs, and some arcades that don't have these extra songs, or...

781
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's how it would have to work is selling DLC to the arcades.

782
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of think it's a great idea, but remember, this is Japan.

783
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,352
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not something that's being tested here.

784
00:51:37,392 --> 00:51:48,256
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very Japanese-centric thing, and for a Japanese arcade where you have karaoke booths that have their own songs and what have you, I could actually see this really working, and yes, I think it would give arcades some identity.

785
00:51:48,276 --> 00:51:54,278
[SPEAKER_03]: They've tried it with Tekken, I want to say, was one of the games that they're going to have DLC for that arcades are going to have to pay for or something like that.

786
00:51:55,038 --> 00:51:55,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

787
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:05,221
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is, though, is like, so that basically kind of excludes all of the other territories other than Japan because a lot of these can't connect to EMUs.

788
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:13,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be stuck with basically the default song list, which may not be a bad thing, but it's just kind of, what's the incentive?

789
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: You put out things that aren't specifically Japan licensed for that first release, but all the DLC will have Japan only licenses.

790
00:52:23,124 --> 00:52:25,565
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what I see happening.

791
00:52:27,526 --> 00:52:29,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what do you think about a reboot of DDR?

792
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

793
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:34,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, I'm kind of like, eh.

794
00:52:34,894 --> 00:52:35,715
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll play it.

795
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:40,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I always play the new stuff when it comes out, but I kind of hit a point where I stopped caring.

796
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good for them.

797
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:43,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it works.

798
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:47,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be honest, they've rebooted DDR like four or five times already.

799
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:51,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think Konami doesn't understand what makes DDR good.

800
00:52:51,675 --> 00:52:55,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, with Extreme, remember, we're starting all over again.

801
00:52:56,016 --> 00:52:59,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they had Supernova, and that was kind of another reboot.

802
00:52:59,117 --> 00:53:01,318
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they had the X series, which is kind of a reboot.

803
00:53:01,338 --> 00:53:03,779
[SPEAKER_03]: They did three games into that, and now they're rebooting it again.

804
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:08,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like, do you guys not know what fucking makes these games good?

805
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

806
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:16,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just kind of like, well, we're just gonna draw straws here until we figure out why this is selling, you know, or why people are playing it or not playing it.

807
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:21,189
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a strong formula for a while and people were excited and then they changed it.

808
00:53:22,029 --> 00:53:51,729
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think that that might have been you know because I mean keep in mind how long have the guitar freaks and drum mania still been going on how popular is pop and music still pop and music is way popular and just because they've kept their formula they haven't kept trying to redesign it they haven't tried to reinvent it and that's I think the problem they're doing with DDR is that they've gotten away from they're trying to make it edgy trying to keep it new but really it's that quirky classic that people like

809
00:53:52,389 --> 00:53:54,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of with Jamie on this.

810
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I said this for years when we were mostly music-based.

811
00:53:57,792 --> 00:54:06,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I said DDR really does need to reinvent itself, and I don't think Supernova or X really were a reinvention whatsoever.

812
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:09,859
[SPEAKER_05]: None of it really did anything to push the franchise forward.

813
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:23,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a little bit hopeful that if they have to go back and put in this infrastructure to support DLC for arcades and all that, maybe they're going to approach other ideas for the game as well, like something to make it a little more competitive or some of this new stuff.

814
00:54:23,668 --> 00:54:29,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think a creative reboot would be a great idea, but I don't know if that's really what we're getting with this game.

815
00:54:30,093 --> 00:54:31,514
[SPEAKER_05]: But kind of like Jamie's...

816
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:32,775
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

817
00:54:51,394 --> 00:54:51,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put it this way.

818
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:57,540
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're not charging for that DLC, then what's the real incentive for them to do it anyways?

819
00:54:58,181 --> 00:55:00,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're not helping themselves.

820
00:55:01,123 --> 00:55:02,645
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to sell any more games.

821
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:10,062
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are charging for DLC, then it all comes down to how much is this stuff costing?

822
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:14,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously in an arcade machine, we're not talking like $5 a song DLC.

823
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:19,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking probably like, you know, a couple hundred dollars or, you know, whatever for these songs.

824
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:21,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And if arcade owners back there, you know,

825
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:24,396
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

826
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:40,433
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

827
00:55:57,236 --> 00:56:02,079
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of what I was talking about a lot earlier with Tekken 3.

828
00:56:04,101 --> 00:56:06,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people, when Tekken 3 came out, I worked at a Namco arcade.

829
00:56:07,483 --> 00:56:11,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had people always coming in saying, how many more matches until we unlock somebody?

830
00:56:12,467 --> 00:56:14,808
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even though I think they were all on a date cycle.

831
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:16,710
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, who's the next person?

832
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in Japan they got this person.

833
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We must be different here.

834
00:56:19,672 --> 00:56:21,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Which they ended up being different.

835
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:25,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that worked for DDR where you would unlock things.

836
00:56:25,176 --> 00:56:25,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

837
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:42,084
[SPEAKER_02]: and I really wish that they would go back to something like that I mean if they're gonna do DLC updates it should still be unlockable stuff you know to keep that excitement to keep people feeling like there's a sense of achievement that it's a community-wide effort

838
00:56:42,659 --> 00:57:00,665
[SPEAKER_05]: that was always the best part about Max 2 was that community part so I'm all for that I will withhold judgment until I actually get to play it which may not be anytime soon if recent DDR releases are any sign but I hope for the best what else can I say

839
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:03,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with news, Loki.

840
00:57:05,451 --> 00:57:06,331
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.

841
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:13,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And honestly, this news doesn't surprise me at all.

842
00:57:14,817 --> 00:57:21,722
[SPEAKER_03]: So the rumor is that the Wii U is not going to launch with all the features on the system.

843
00:57:22,623 --> 00:57:25,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of sound a little familiar with Nintendo's kind of MO.

844
00:57:26,345 --> 00:57:38,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they're seeing right now that the features including Miiverse and the near field communication that they won't be on the actual system.

845
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:41,993
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to download Miiverse in order to actually have it.

846
00:57:43,134 --> 00:57:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Which kind of seems a little odd to me.

847
00:57:44,935 --> 00:57:47,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't that supposed to be what you see when you turn on your Wii U?

848
00:57:47,856 --> 00:57:48,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

849
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:50,217
[SPEAKER_03]: That's weird.

850
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:51,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

851
00:57:53,124 --> 00:58:01,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, you know, obviously later on they're going to add some other support and stuff for multiple gamepads and that kind of thing, which makes no sense right now because no games use it.

852
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But and even the near field of communication stuff doesn't really make any sense to have that right now because nothing uses it.

853
00:58:08,909 --> 00:58:26,265
[SPEAKER_03]: But Miiverse is a little weird that that wouldn't be on the actual console because, I don't know, they're saying that it's possible that it won't be available at launch because considering third parties can't access it right now.

854
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:31,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So... Hold on, let me get this straight here.

855
00:58:31,954 --> 00:58:33,295
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to have any games incorporated?

856
00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:34,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

857
00:58:34,476 --> 00:58:35,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me get this straight here.

858
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:41,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have this thing that's supposed to tie into these games, but no games can tie into it.

859
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,282
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's kind of funny that that's true because third-party games can access it.

860
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:55,648
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big games that they showed this whole Miiverse thing was with Zombie U. So that was all bullshit that they were kind of pushing our way?

861
00:58:55,668 --> 00:58:55,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

862
00:58:57,316 --> 00:58:57,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know

863
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:06,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of retarded that you have a Nintendo system launch without all the features in there.

864
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the 3DS?

865
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:08,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was the web browser?

866
00:59:08,863 --> 00:59:10,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it didn't come out until months after.

867
00:59:11,926 --> 00:59:13,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what?

868
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:18,010
[SPEAKER_03]: You're selling me this broken piece of shit that you're going to patch in the stuff later on?

869
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:23,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you delay the release a little bit and have it done?

870
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:26,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bother pushing this out when stuff isn't done yet?

871
00:59:26,836 --> 00:59:31,078
[SPEAKER_03]: or, I don't know, this is a main feature of the console and you haven't fucking finished it yet?

872
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:34,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that complicated of a piece of software.

873
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:36,921
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is all rumor.

874
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:38,242
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all rumor.

875
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:43,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, me versus me could be also one of those things that, like, they're gonna, like, quote-unquote, patch in day one.

876
00:59:44,365 --> 00:59:47,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it could be one of those things that, like, they're really working right up to the last minute.

877
00:59:47,447 --> 00:59:50,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm totally theorizing, just throwing it out there.

878
00:59:51,229 --> 00:59:52,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Me vs. One Thing Near Field Communication

879
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:35,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say as much as this opinion may not be popular there's been other Nintendo stuff in the past where they slowly unraveled things like I seem to remember the original DS and the whole like downloading demos and all this that wasn't there when the system first launched that was something that came up later and the whole internet connectivity and it was like that feature was just waiting in your DS the whole time to be enabled so if there's stuff like that that we don't yet know about that's kind of hiding and waiting in the Wii U that's

880
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:36,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

881
01:00:52,939 --> 01:01:01,681
[SPEAKER_03]: and, oh, maybe later on we'll have a way that you can store things, you know, on your SD memory card instead of just backing up your saves on that.

882
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:07,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, oh, I don't know, how about we just, you know, have a feature now where you can download digital copies of the games.

883
01:01:07,963 --> 01:01:10,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're so far behind.

884
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:13,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all these other companies have been doing this for a long time.

885
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:16,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like they push it out to their customers like...

886
01:01:17,205 --> 01:01:18,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look at what Nintendo's doing.

887
01:01:18,526 --> 01:01:21,967
[SPEAKER_03]: We're offering demos of games and everyone's like, fuck yeah, it's amazing.

888
01:01:21,987 --> 01:01:23,947
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awfully new technology.

889
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:27,369
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, it's been fucking done for years now.

890
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:29,509
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing demos on the PlayStation 1.

891
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:34,131
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, for some reason, Nintendo is unable to give you a demo of anything.

892
01:01:35,242 --> 01:01:53,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Nintendo's big thing is that they've been trying to avoid anything that's going to damage, not necessarily their reputation or their brand, but avoid ways for pirating, avoid ways for region outsourcing, not outsourcing is not the word I'm thinking of, but

893
01:01:53,636 --> 01:01:58,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, going outside the region, avoiding incidents for online chat.

894
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:05,062
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really, really trying, I think, way too hard to preserve their brand.

895
01:02:06,103 --> 01:02:14,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're sacrificing a lot of the options that people have come to expect from a modern day gaming system for the sake of that little neurosis, I guess.

896
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:20,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me get into this next story, because it's almost right up the same alley of what we've been talking about here.

897
01:02:20,635 --> 01:02:30,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And this really caught wildfire all over the internet, because Origin, the ever-popular EA service, updated their privacy policy.

898
01:02:30,517 --> 01:02:34,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has a lot of people wondering, how exactly does Origin play into the Wii U?

899
01:02:34,898 --> 01:02:43,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in the new policy, it says, "...by signing up to play EA's titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA."

900
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:54,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Information transferred to EA includes your Mii information, email address, Nintendo Network ID, friends list, country, language, and date of birth.

901
01:02:55,625 --> 01:03:04,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So this seems to confirm that Origin will be a part of how you're going to play EA games on Wii U. But my thought is, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

902
01:03:04,988 --> 01:03:10,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Because before we start saying, oh my god, it's going to be Origin on the Wii U, which would be dreadful news indeed.

903
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:10,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

904
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:15,093
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were to see that Origin logo pop up on the Wii U, I'd be like, it's over.

905
01:03:15,594 --> 01:03:18,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo did not convince me they understand online.

906
01:03:18,856 --> 01:03:19,396
[SPEAKER_05]: This is done.

907
01:03:19,536 --> 01:03:19,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

908
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:28,422
[SPEAKER_05]: But hold on a minute because EA and your Origin account, they also interact with your Xbox 360 account and your PlayStation 3 account.

909
01:03:28,982 --> 01:03:29,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And your Wii.

910
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and your original Wii.

911
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:31,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

912
01:03:31,964 --> 01:03:32,264
[SPEAKER_05]: They do.

913
01:03:32,925 --> 01:03:37,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of that kind of interfaces in that EA console when you go on there.

914
01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:39,029
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

915
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:43,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hopefully this isn't much different.

916
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:45,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's any different.

917
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially like, okay, maybe it just wants the me information, so put your little picture on the origin account or whatever, but I don't think that's a huge deal.

918
01:03:52,907 --> 01:03:54,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other people are learning out of this.

919
01:03:54,228 --> 01:03:55,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you haven't done penis face.

920
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:03,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, to also draw out of this, the Nintendo Network ID is seemingly telling, that's a huge part of it, that where's the friend code?

921
01:04:04,398 --> 01:04:33,482
[SPEAKER_05]: so maybe they finally are doing some type of universal ID is that an ID name that I get to pick or is that a Nintendo Network ID number I don't know we shall soon see so of course all the big blogs reaching out to Nintendo for comment but they're not saying anything right now I wouldn't panic I don't think this means it's Origin on Wii U at least I hope not because Origin is terrible and it will be a terrible thing for the Wii U if that happens they would never do that

922
01:04:34,764 --> 01:04:39,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not buy Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U if it has the origin tie-in.

923
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:40,239
[SPEAKER_05]: There's literally no point.

924
01:04:42,729 --> 01:04:44,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely going to have Origin.

925
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U will have Origin.

926
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:49,911
[SPEAKER_05]: But in what capacity?

927
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:51,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, on the Xbox 360, you don't see it.

928
01:04:51,912 --> 01:04:52,972
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the Xbox 360.

929
01:04:53,112 --> 01:05:02,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's fine then because what it's doing, it's talking to Origin's servers to get your Galaxy information and get some of that stuff and update your stuff on the EA social Bioware site or whatever.

930
01:05:03,235 --> 01:05:06,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine because the connectivity isn't happening through Origin.

931
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

932
01:05:26,744 --> 01:05:49,501
[SPEAKER_02]: but I ran it through Steam I never had a problem it wouldn't connect to the servers right when I loaded it up but I could log in I'm not even getting the option anymore with my Mass Effect 3 which if it was the patch I'm just saying but I think Origin has something to do with it too even though I'm connecting just fine through Origin so they just need to get their shit together

933
01:05:49,881 --> 01:05:54,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, unfortunately these are things we just aren't going to know until the Wii U actually comes out.

934
01:05:54,406 --> 01:05:55,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So, meanwhile, more news.

935
01:05:56,088 --> 01:05:56,629
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

936
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:01,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully something better than freaking Origin.

937
01:06:02,162 --> 01:06:04,703
[SPEAKER_02]: How about Super Mario 64?

938
01:06:06,744 --> 01:06:09,785
[SPEAKER_02]: 16 years since this game has come out.

939
01:06:10,305 --> 01:06:12,346
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband and I used to play a crap ton of it.

940
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now there is a PC mod for Super Mario 64 that lets you play co-op online.

941
01:06:20,688 --> 01:06:22,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It was modded by Skellux.

942
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:24,750
[SPEAKER_02]: S-K-E-L-U-X

943
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:25,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario Star Road

944
01:06:45,087 --> 01:06:49,830
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one keeps the level design and everything, but makes it co-op.

945
01:06:52,452 --> 01:06:54,734
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not playing as Luigi, though, however.

946
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:57,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing as sort of a recolored Mario.

947
01:06:58,296 --> 01:06:59,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Luigi.

948
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:05,801
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like the taller... It's like a gray Mario, gray and red Mario.

949
01:07:07,002 --> 01:07:08,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of like a palette swap.

950
01:07:09,243 --> 01:07:10,764
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, it's cool.

951
01:07:13,106 --> 01:07:14,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually want to check this out.

952
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, Tigerclaw in our chatroom is telling me, Rob, it's been done.

953
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:20,808
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

954
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:21,989
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

955
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:23,690
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the internet.

956
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:24,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it's been done.

957
01:07:26,932 --> 01:07:34,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that are coming to a store near you, hopefully with less dubstep.

958
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:38,623
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a few games coming out this week since we're in the fourth quarter.

959
01:07:39,583 --> 01:07:40,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start off.

960
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:44,185
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing some re-releases of stuff.

961
01:07:44,405 --> 01:07:50,508
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the Namco Museum DS and Pac-Man World 3 bundled together on one DS cart.

962
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:51,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's coming out.

963
01:07:52,128 --> 01:07:57,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur 4 are being bundled together on PS3 and Xbox 360.

[SPEAKER_03]: uh we've got Assassin's Creed 3 on PlayStation 3 Xbox 360 and on PC Thundercats on the Nintendo DS Transformers wow hey it's probably based off the new Thundercats series which is probably not that good uh Thundercat or Thundercats

965
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:22,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Transformers Prime, the game on the Wii, the DS, and the 3DS.

01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:36,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

969
01:08:36,522 --> 01:08:37,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a Vita game I can actually play.

970
01:08:38,904 --> 01:08:39,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Myst on the 3DS.

971

01:10:07,218 --> 01:10:11,299
[SPEAKER_03]: and Need for Speed.

980
01:10:13,019 --> 01:10:14,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be it.

981
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and PC version of Lego Lord of the Rings this week as well.

982
01:10:18,641 --> 01:10:21,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation on the Vita.

983
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:22,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't forget that one.

984
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:23,722
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually supposed to be pretty good.

985
01:10:24,122 --> 01:10:30,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Smartass on the Vita and Ragnarok Odyssey on the Vita as well.

986
01:10:30,663 --> 01:10:33,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for this week, I believe.

987
01:10:35,224 --> 01:10:38,025
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.

988
01:10:38,185 --> 01:10:46,608
[SPEAKER_05]: On November 1st, Medal of Honor Warfighter on the Xbox 360 and NBA 2K13 gets its Japanese release also on the 360.

989
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:54,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the PlayStation 3, Dead Island, Zombie of the Year Edition, Medal of Honor Warfighter and NBA 2K13.

990
01:10:55,312 --> 01:11:01,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Okami Zekkaiban, this is the HD remaster of Okami, is finally out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

991
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:06,477
[SPEAKER_05]: and Tales of... Are you supposed to say Zillia or Shillia?

992
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:08,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's an X. Exilia?

993
01:11:08,959 --> 01:11:10,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Tales of Shillia.

994
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:11,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be Zillia.

995
01:11:11,461 --> 01:11:11,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Zillia?

996
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:12,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, whatever.

997
01:11:12,722 --> 01:11:15,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Tales of Zillia 2 is out this week.

998
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:19,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's even a version that comes with a new DualShock controller and all this stuff.

999
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:20,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Xylophone, Rob.

1000
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:23,669
[SPEAKER_05]: All these different little limited editions coming with that.

1001
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:25,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty exciting.

1002
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:27,032
[SPEAKER_05]: That must be a major holiday release in Japan.

1003
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:30,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing on the Vita this week, really.

1004
01:11:30,614 --> 01:11:33,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And just checking the 3DS real quick to see if we have anything there.

1005
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:41,281
[SPEAKER_05]: A black Nintendo 3DS XL and then one that has Monster Hunter 3G as well.

1006
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:42,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, World Soccer Winning 11 2013.

1007
01:11:43,002 --> 01:11:44,043
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1008
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:44,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Soccer games.

1009
01:11:45,364 --> 01:11:46,565
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Japanese releases.

1010
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:47,145
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1011
01:11:48,366 --> 01:11:49,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, I just shot my yarn.

1012
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:50,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nose.

1013
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:51,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

1014
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: As I had the list up.

1015
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1016
01:11:55,882 --> 01:12:01,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on the 30th, we have Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation for Vita.

1017
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:05,609
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry if I sound weird, I just took a cough drop.

1018
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:09,172
[SPEAKER_02]: 31st, Assassin's Creed 3 for 360 and PlayStation 3.

1019
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:12,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Sports Champions 2 for PS3.

1020
01:12:12,434 --> 01:12:15,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have to move on to November's dates.

1021
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:19,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid thing.

1022
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:23,042
[SPEAKER_02]: November...

1023
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:29,605
[SPEAKER_02]: On the first, we have WWE 13 for a number of systems.

1024
01:12:30,086 --> 01:12:37,630
[SPEAKER_02]: On the second, Football Manager 2013, Just Dance 4, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Nike Plus Connect Training, Silent Hill Book of Memories.

1025
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:38,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1026
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:43,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.

1027
01:12:43,128 --> 01:12:46,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1028
01:12:46,752 --> 01:12:48,353
[SPEAKER_05]: What did DarkSakura pick this week?

1029
01:12:48,894 --> 01:12:50,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Find out after two more stories.

1030
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:50,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1031
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:58,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's unfortunate that we have to report on more closures and layoffs, but...

1032
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:03,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Zynga has laid off 5% of their workforce, kind of a restructuring that they're doing.

1033
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:18,073
[SPEAKER_03]: They let go roughly 3,200 employees, and with that, they've closed Zynga's Boston studio, and also the studios in Japan and UK are being kind of slated for...

1034
01:13:18,633 --> 01:13:19,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Shutdown soon.

1035
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:22,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the Austin office.

1036
01:13:23,937 --> 01:13:26,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They've laid off quite a few people there.

1037
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:33,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've also shut down, I guess, 13 of their older games.

1038
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:40,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they quote, significantly reducing their investment in The Ville.

1039
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a good thing being since they're being sued by EA for The Ville, so it sounds like the outlook on that is not too favorable.

1040
01:13:52,299 --> 01:13:53,280
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of disappointing.

1041
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what Dan told me?

1042
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:57,563
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that their stock right now is lower than RadioShack.

1043
01:13:59,004 --> 01:13:59,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch!

1044
01:13:59,845 --> 01:14:01,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty bad.

1045
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:08,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, I got one story for you too.

1046
01:14:08,833 --> 01:14:11,816
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, that was shady that they did that during the whole Apple conference.

1047
01:14:12,276 --> 01:14:14,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, like a lot of people assume that was intentional.

1048
01:14:15,339 --> 01:14:16,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it really wasn't.

1049
01:14:16,801 --> 01:14:23,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to give Zynga what little shred of doubt I can, maybe that actually wasn't intentional that they did it during the Apple conference.

1050
01:14:23,747 --> 01:14:25,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Because seriously, how are you going to hide something like that?

1051
01:14:26,169 --> 01:14:27,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You think the internet wouldn't notice?

1052
01:14:28,407 --> 01:14:29,889
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1053
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I don't know.

1054
01:14:44,543 --> 01:14:45,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to judge my Facebook.

1055
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:49,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people went and got it the day it came out, and they're actually really excited about it.

1056
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:50,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they're really enjoying it.

1057
01:14:50,832 --> 01:14:51,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

1058
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:58,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give it a couple months before that whole super sale is done at the end of January to see if it's something I really need.

1059
01:14:58,503 --> 01:14:58,703
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

1060
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:02,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you're dying to know, what about the games?

1061
01:15:02,634 --> 01:15:04,095
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the games that come with Windows 8?

1062
01:15:04,476 --> 01:15:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's tell you about the new games with Windows 8.

1063
01:15:06,898 --> 01:15:12,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft Solitaire Collection is one of the games in Windows 8, which of course, it's Windows, it's gotta have Solitaire, right?

1064
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:15,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, these all have achievements and stuff too.

1065
01:15:17,385 --> 01:15:22,788
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like Klondike Solitaire and Pyramid and all the stuff you'd be used to.

1066
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:25,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Minesweeper is back in Windows 8.

1067
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,290
[SPEAKER_05]: But here's the crazy part.

1068
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Minesweeper now has an adventure mode.

1069
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:31,531
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1070
01:15:31,892 --> 01:15:32,452
[SPEAKER_05]: No one care.

1071
01:15:32,532 --> 01:15:33,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the screenshot.

1072
01:15:33,532 --> 01:15:36,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like little explorer dude going through the cave.

1073
01:15:36,534 --> 01:15:36,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1074
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:38,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

1075
01:15:38,775 --> 01:15:43,016
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as you say no one care, I gotta say it looks better.

1076
01:15:43,036 --> 01:15:44,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Driller did it better.

1077
01:15:44,097 --> 01:15:44,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1078
01:15:47,382 --> 01:15:47,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1079
01:15:48,723 --> 01:15:49,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Other games within the Windows 8.

1080
01:15:50,184 --> 01:15:57,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft Mahjong, which I think they've kind of been including ever since Shanghai, the old PC game was popular.

1081
01:15:57,249 --> 01:15:58,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Mahjong.

1082
01:15:59,691 --> 01:16:00,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Wordament.

1083
01:16:01,286 --> 01:16:01,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Adera

1084
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:24,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of got like a little story that goes with it, a stone and sorcery magic type game, but it's more like a puzzler.

1085
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:26,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get like a, you know, I don't know.

1086
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:30,169
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's like a very simple type of adventure game.

1087
01:16:30,649 --> 01:16:32,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another free Windows 8 game.

1088
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,030
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1089
01:16:33,411 --> 01:16:38,033
[SPEAKER_05]: We've come a long way since the days of just good old solitaire with the bouncing card when you finish, right?

1090
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:39,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, Rob?

1091
01:16:39,535 --> 01:16:43,460
[SPEAKER_02]: The moment that you said that, my brain instantly went to, like, a Virginia Slims ad.

1092
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:44,881
[SPEAKER_04]: How so?

1093
01:16:44,981 --> 01:16:51,069
[SPEAKER_02]: With, like, gamers, you know, sitting around making shit faces at, you know, Windows 8.

1094
01:16:51,229 --> 01:16:53,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has, you've come a long way, baby.

1095
01:16:56,575 --> 01:16:57,136
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

1096
01:17:18,345 --> 01:17:23,477
[SPEAKER_05]: You, listen, classic game, play, now.

1097
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:25,581
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1098
01:17:26,519 --> 01:17:34,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic Game of the Week is Panzer Dragoon, which I thought that I had done it before, but I had done Saga, or RPG as we got it.

1099
01:17:36,767 --> 01:17:37,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, as it came out in Japan.

1100
01:17:38,209 --> 01:17:42,032
[SPEAKER_02]: So Panzer Dragoon is a rail shooter by Team Andromeda.

1101
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out on the Saturn in 1995.

1102
01:17:44,814 --> 01:17:47,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on there were other versions for PC, PS2.

1103
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:52,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came as a bonus in Panzer Dragoon Order on Xbox.

1104
01:17:53,942 --> 01:18:01,835
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you basically play as Kale Fluge, who is unnamed in the US version.

1105
01:18:03,696 --> 01:18:07,200
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically you just go through and you shoot stuff.

1106
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:09,503
[SPEAKER_02]: But the game's freaking gorgeous.

1107
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:16,571
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people gave the Saturn shit for its 3D, and yeah, it didn't do 3D as good as the PlayStation did.

1108
01:18:17,052 --> 01:18:23,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It was built originally as a 2D machine, but this game really illustrated what you could do with the Saturn.

1109
01:18:25,781 --> 01:18:30,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you have machines and monsters as your enemies.

1110
01:18:31,766 --> 01:18:34,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of like a post-apocalyptic fantasy world.

1111
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:44,175
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to go through, you've got the different boss battles that actually pause the game before the boss battle.

1112
01:18:44,956 --> 01:18:51,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have X and Y axes that you can move across on for those boss battles.

1113
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:59,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but basically you can look all the way around, I mean, your enemies are coming from everywhere, but you're still on rails.

1114
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:07,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you've got two weapons, you have a handgun, and then you have a homing laser that your dragon fires.

1115
01:19:08,664 --> 01:19:16,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It has six levels, each one about five minutes, and then there's a boss battle, and the sixth, though, is a special boss battle, so...

1116
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:27,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say that, just going back into this one, now, I played a little bit of it, but you know how I get with certain games.

1117
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:28,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I get motion sick.

1118
01:19:28,611 --> 01:19:29,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one that made me motion sick.

1119
01:19:31,368 --> 01:19:36,690
[SPEAKER_02]: However, since this was a Sega game, of course it was out on the Saturn.

1120
01:19:38,591 --> 01:19:43,494
[SPEAKER_02]: It started off, though, as a different project.

1121
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:50,837
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they were trying to develop a shoot-em-up game, and it eventually evolved into Panzer Dragoon.

1122
01:19:52,657 --> 01:20:20,821
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah pretty awesome game but they were under a big time frame for actually developing it and they were the original name of the game was actually Kikoryu which is Armored Dragon but they wanted to pick something that sounded a little bit more exciting so they picked a German name Panzer Dragoon and there you go

1123
01:20:22,881 --> 01:20:23,342
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it?

1124
01:20:24,122 --> 01:20:24,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1125
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:26,385
[SPEAKER_05]: What a pretty game, though, especially for its time.

1126
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:27,326
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a gorgeous game.

1127
01:20:28,087 --> 01:20:30,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was actually named the best Saturn game of 1995 by EGM.

1128
01:20:30,649 --> 01:20:30,729
[SPEAKER_02]: R.I.P.

1129
01:20:37,023 --> 01:20:45,769
[SPEAKER_02]: and this game also sold well enough that they could do Panzer Dragoons Vi which of course is keeping with that German naming.

1130
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:53,134
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also give it one up, give it a retro review of 8 out of 10.

1131
01:20:55,215 --> 01:20:56,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So, not bad.

1132
01:20:57,216 --> 01:20:57,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1133
01:20:58,457 --> 01:21:00,518
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, Panzer Dragoon, your classic game of the week.

1134
01:21:00,538 --> 01:21:01,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Good pick, DarkSakura, good pick.

1135
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:02,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank Dan.

1136
01:21:03,619 --> 01:21:04,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Good pick, Dan.

1137
01:21:04,299 --> 01:21:04,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Good pick.

1138
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what should I pick?

1139
01:21:07,721 --> 01:21:08,941
[SPEAKER_05]: You can bring Dan back to the show.

1140
01:21:08,981 --> 01:21:10,081
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a fourth mic now.

1141
01:21:10,802 --> 01:21:14,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to the kind, benevolent people at PodCulture.

1142
01:21:14,563 --> 01:21:17,124
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have Dan all the time, then it's not special.

1143
01:21:17,304 --> 01:21:18,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Must be like my life.

1144
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:18,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1145
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:24,327
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1146
01:21:24,767 --> 01:21:26,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.

1147
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:29,471
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a very busy Part B when we come back.

1148
01:21:30,472 --> 01:21:39,379
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, and listless all when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1149
01:21:45,894 --> 01:21:48,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1150
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:57,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 28th of 2012, with the 479th episode of our show.

1151
01:21:57,742 --> 01:22:03,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting into Part B, and we'll be doing some rapid-fire news and the Fugle Question of the Week and a special list list tonight.

1152
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:08,508
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, we have some breaking news to start off Part B. Breaking news.

1153
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:08,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Breaking news.

1154
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:14,820
The 8th Annual Podcast Award nominees are in at podcastawards.com and we got nominated!

1155
01:22:30,933 --> 01:22:45,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Launch Radio is a nominee for Best Gaming and there's 10 shows in the gaming category including a couple that also got some bigger nominations for People's Choice and Best Produced so it's going to be some big competition this year and

1156
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:46,860
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1157
01:23:09,353 --> 01:23:11,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we would really like it very much if it's us.

1158
01:23:11,816 --> 01:23:13,138
[SPEAKER_05]: A specific indie to win, yeah.

1159
01:23:13,158 --> 01:23:15,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we very much want this specific indie to win.

1160
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,024
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if we can't, we really hope one of the indies takes it.

1161
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:21,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So, good luck to the indies in here.

1162
01:23:21,426 --> 01:23:23,989
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the corp cast goes, you're going down.

1163
01:23:25,591 --> 01:23:26,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So, podcastwords.com.

1164
01:23:26,372 --> 01:23:27,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Power to the people, yo.

1165
01:23:27,373 --> 01:23:27,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Power to the people.

1166
01:23:29,055 --> 01:23:30,096
[SPEAKER_05]: The daily voting, and I...

1167
01:23:30,456 --> 01:23:35,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know all of those shows, so I apologize if you are an indie show and I did not name you specifically.

1168
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:40,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do more research before voting opens on November 1st is when the voting opens.

1169
01:23:40,906 --> 01:23:41,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1170
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:50,175
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be trying to whore for your votes like crazy come November 1st because we are going to need them.

1171
01:23:50,195 --> 01:23:51,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can vote every day.

1172
01:23:52,097 --> 01:23:55,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you can vote every day, so we will be reminding you every day, so please help.

1173
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:03,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we don't ask for money, we don't ask for subscriptions, we don't have a plus feed or something that you pay extra money to get.

1174
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:08,590
[SPEAKER_05]: All we want, we want your votes to help us spread the word.

1175
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:14,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that, you know, obviously we want legit votes, but they do allow one vote per email address.

1176
01:24:15,241 --> 01:24:19,964
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in chat says, Rob, aren't you torn that Horde House did not get nominated?

1177
01:24:20,604 --> 01:24:27,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's much easier this way because then I only have to champion for one show to get votes because that would be weird if the other show had gotten nominated.

1178
01:24:28,449 --> 01:24:36,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I did notice it was interesting that The Instance wasn't nominated because I know they've been nominated almost every year so maybe they didn't go for it this year.

1179
01:24:36,973 --> 01:24:37,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1180
01:24:38,234 --> 01:24:43,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Four Player Podcast, they've had the lock on this thing for like three, four years because they have a huge...

1181
01:24:43,937 --> 01:24:46,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge fan community and they're very rabid.

1182
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,042
[SPEAKER_05]: They were not eligible this year.

1183
01:24:48,162 --> 01:24:52,687
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they're not nominated because they won the biggest of the big awards last year and there's some weird rules.

1184
01:24:52,767 --> 01:24:55,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll be back next year guaranteed.

1185
01:24:55,831 --> 01:25:00,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's any year we actually stand a chance in hell to win, it's going to be this year.

1186
01:25:00,556 --> 01:25:04,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So please throw us your votes come November 1st.

1187
01:25:05,848 --> 01:25:06,308
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1188
01:25:06,749 --> 01:25:12,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, I also have to say this, no other VOG show nominated I looked.

1189
01:25:12,513 --> 01:25:26,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little depressed because I know I nominated some, but I guess it was just a lot of competition or what have you, and we were whoring the nominations quite a bit, so hopefully we were able to catch some eyes there.

1190
01:25:27,786 --> 01:25:31,649
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to do our best to represent VOG and try to win it for us.

1191
01:25:31,729 --> 01:25:32,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whores we are.

1192
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:36,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1193
01:25:36,293 --> 01:25:38,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys very much for helping that happen.

1194
01:25:38,615 --> 01:25:39,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, really, really, really appreciate it.

1195
01:25:39,996 --> 01:25:43,019
[SPEAKER_05]: And lots of celebratory stuff in chat right now.

1196
01:25:43,059 --> 01:25:43,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

1197
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire says, will you pay me to vote for you?

1198
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:50,206
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll pay you in hugs and kisses.

1199
01:25:51,343 --> 01:25:53,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not like the presidential nominees.

1200
01:25:53,284 --> 01:25:54,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, we don't pay people for votes.

1201
01:25:56,764 --> 01:26:02,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Taiki says, fuck the podcast awards after irreligiosophy got snubbed twice.

1202
01:26:02,686 --> 01:26:10,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I've kind of had some give and take feelings about the podcast awards because let's be real, it is a huge popularity contest.

1203
01:26:10,068 --> 01:26:11,929
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's great promotion.

1204
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:12,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to lie.

1205
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:13,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great promotion.

1206
01:26:13,889 --> 01:26:15,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got to do the best we can.

1207
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:16,470
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

1208
01:26:17,710 --> 01:26:21,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick gaming news for you guys.

1209
01:26:21,913 --> 01:26:22,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

1210
01:26:22,874 --> 01:26:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you like collectible figures, there's going to be some new vinyl figures coming out from Funko Pop.

1211
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:36,022
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got some Halo 4 figures and very chibi looking.

1212
01:26:36,162 --> 01:26:43,607
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got Cortana and it looks like Master Chief and a couple other of the Spartans.

1213
01:26:43,647 --> 01:26:46,529
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a red Spartan and a blue Spartan.

1214
01:26:47,570 --> 01:27:13,586
[SPEAKER_03]: so those should be coming soon I'd get a red one but make him purple so it could be donut or pink yes that'd be pretty cool and I'm sure you could paint your own Spartan if you want to but I believe those are going to be available soon if they're not already available I mean they've got to be probably available now since Halo comes out in a week

1215
01:27:15,486 --> 01:27:16,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it's already a week?

1216
01:27:17,187 --> 01:27:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.

1217
01:27:19,709 --> 01:27:21,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's right, because it's election day that it comes out.

1218
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:22,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy.

1219
01:27:23,311 --> 01:27:25,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, election day is right around the corner.

1220
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:27,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all this bullshit will be over.

1221
01:27:29,054 --> 01:27:30,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is my mailing bell?

1222
01:27:30,655 --> 01:27:31,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten that.

1223

[SPEAKER_02]: I got mine.

01:27:32,676 --> 01:27:32,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

[SPEAKER_03]: Because Alan got his.

1226
01:27:34,097 --> 01:27:35,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I got mine like two weeks ago.

1227
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:52,715
[SPEAKER_03]: um okay so Team Fortress 2 they're doing some fun stuff for Halloween of course um Scream Fortress is coming back and what would come with you know your staple Halloween thing why of course zombies zombies would come

[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, they've got different events going on including Haunted, King of the Hill matches.

1229
01:28:00,321 --> 01:28:07,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they've got, I guess, a game, what was it, BombinupCon?

1230
01:28:09,248 --> 01:28:11,589
[SPEAKER_03]: and some wizards and stuff.

1231
01:28:11,649 --> 01:28:13,210
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all, of course, Halloween themed.

1232
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:21,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to have a brand new man versus machine mission called Wave 666, which will have undead robot enemies.

1233
01:28:22,573 --> 01:28:23,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So, neat.

1234
01:28:23,473 --> 01:28:28,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there's some unique hats to be had there because why wouldn't they have unique hats?

1235
01:28:30,115 --> 01:28:30,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

1236
01:28:32,236 --> 01:28:32,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh oh, Loki.

1237
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:32,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh oh.

1238
01:28:32,717 --> 01:28:34,178
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you said, didn't you?

1239
01:28:34,198 --> 01:28:35,800
[SPEAKER_03]: You said it.

1240
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:35,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh oh.

1241
01:29:00,277 --> 01:29:02,860
[SPEAKER_05]: It came on my radio, I said, last week.

1242
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Pee Wee's Playhouse.

1243
01:29:04,481 --> 01:29:07,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever somebody says the secret word, you just have to start, you just have to get down.

1244
01:29:07,825 --> 01:29:13,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that gif that's out there, by the way, of the football player that's getting down doing the Gangnam Style dance.

1245
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:43,882
[SPEAKER_05]: um they're saying other artists that are going to be coming soon Justin Bieber, One Direction, LMFAO and um yeah that's all they've mentioned so far did you hear about the hacking of Justin Bieber's twitter that was fucked up oh my god that was so fucked up I am sorry that was amazing it's one of those things like you're laughing at and then you're like oh my god I'm going to hell for laughing at this because this is terrible alright repeat it for those that may not have heard

1246
01:29:44,162 --> 01:29:52,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it was 4chan people that did it, hacked Justin Bieber's Twitter and posted that he had cancer and was going bald from his treatments.

1247
01:29:53,028 --> 01:30:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these girls started shaving their head and posting little signs that said bald for Bieber.

1248
01:30:01,533 --> 01:30:03,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1249
01:30:03,835 --> 01:30:05,856
[SPEAKER_03]: That is messed up.

1250
01:30:05,876 --> 01:30:07,097
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious.

1251
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:10,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Just goes to show the whole sheep thing, you know?

1252
01:30:11,226 --> 01:30:12,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious.

1253
01:30:13,253 --> 01:30:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're probably disappointed when he's not really dying from cancer.

1254
01:30:18,951 --> 01:30:20,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

1255
01:30:21,273 --> 01:30:23,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to news about the Commodore 64.

1256
01:30:23,755 --> 01:30:24,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you heard me.

1257
01:30:24,856 --> 01:30:25,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Commodore 64.

1258
01:30:26,017 --> 01:30:30,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Crate Box is a game that's been out there and it's turned two this past week.

1259
01:30:30,461 --> 01:30:32,763
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did a free iOS version to celebrate.

1260
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:41,551
[SPEAKER_05]: However, what's awesome, they're doing a game called Super Bread Box that's going to be an adaptation of the game on the Commodore 64 by the guys who did C64 Cannibalt.

1261
01:30:43,913 --> 01:31:12,129
[SPEAKER_05]: C64Ball So there's already a YouTube out there This is going to be available, they say, in early December Check out that awesome soundtrack going into this God, the C64 was so great Flamethrower Every game needs a flamethrower A brand new website launched this week that has a lot of people excited Polygon.com finally officially launched this week

1262
01:31:12,669 --> 01:31:32,311
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's notable because there's a lot of like game journalists like people that were big on Joystick before and Kotaku before and some other websites that kind of all came together to form this website and I saw a lot of people on Twitter that were kind of spazzing about the website launching and you know it's a nice looking website I don't know Jamie have you seen this website at all yet?

1263
01:31:33,011 --> 01:31:34,692
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about their design choices?

1264
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:05,267
[SPEAKER_02]: The other problem with that being too is that you're going to deal with different resolutions and this is clearly optimized for max resolution.

1265
01:32:06,148 --> 01:32:07,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not going to work for everybody.

1266
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1267
01:32:08,549 --> 01:32:09,989
[SPEAKER_05]: The mobile site's really good looking though.

1268
01:32:10,109 --> 01:32:10,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that.

1269
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:12,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So congrats to them for finally starting this.

1270
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,271
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am going to say one little thing.

1271
01:32:14,371 --> 01:32:17,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to dog on this here because we do that.

1272
01:32:18,793 --> 01:32:22,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get the whole documentary and making of stuff.

1273
01:32:22,415 --> 01:32:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little too much ego for me.

1274
01:32:24,416 --> 01:32:25,116
[SPEAKER_03]: A little smug.

1275
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:26,817
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a little smug.

1276
01:32:26,877 --> 01:32:28,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very smug.

1277
01:32:28,677 --> 01:32:31,998
[SPEAKER_05]: All these little documentaries about the launching of the website and the making of the website.

1278
01:32:32,138 --> 01:32:33,679
[SPEAKER_03]: No one gives a fuck, except for you.

1279
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:37,020
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit should be organic.

1280
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:42,342
[SPEAKER_05]: This feels forced, and it makes me not want to like your website.

1281
01:32:42,402 --> 01:32:43,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just being perfectly honest.

1282
01:32:43,663 --> 01:32:48,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I do like the writing, and I like a lot of the people that are there, and ultimately that wins out.

1283
01:32:48,664 --> 01:32:52,606
[SPEAKER_05]: But I gotta say, all that self-serving bullshit is kinda...

1284
01:32:54,147 --> 01:32:58,229
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be like hosting an awards ceremony where you're going to award yourself for being so awesome.

1285
01:32:58,729 --> 01:33:00,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure that's right around the corner.

1286
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:02,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Polygon's awards for Polygon.

1287
01:33:05,552 --> 01:33:11,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And realize that we just told people to please go vote for us in an online awards ceremony, but I'm sorry.

1288
01:33:11,215 --> 01:33:16,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I don't have a fucking documentary about... Let me start a new website.

1289
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:18,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to create a documentary about starting said website.

1290
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:31,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But really to go back to this though is that their design, I like consistency.

1291
01:33:31,448 --> 01:33:34,149
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have consistency with a good website.

1292
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:39,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And with it switching back and forth, you're really not giving it enough consistency.

1293
01:33:39,433 --> 01:33:46,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you're sacrificing memory for people who may not be optimized to use your site.

1294
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:51,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer it to keep a constant format.

1295
01:33:51,363 --> 01:33:55,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the large splash image up at the top and then the sight going into it.

1296
01:33:55,488 --> 01:33:58,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the three columnular point of view.

1297
01:33:58,953 --> 01:34:01,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that you need to pick a style and stick with it.

1298
01:34:02,539 --> 01:34:04,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, of course, the writing is the most important.

1299
01:34:04,621 --> 01:34:06,402
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do have some really interesting in-depth articles.

1300
01:34:06,422 --> 01:34:08,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing doesn't do anything if you can't find shit.

1301
01:34:11,425 --> 01:34:11,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Snap.

1302
01:34:12,686 --> 01:34:12,986
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1303
01:34:14,167 --> 01:34:16,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to one other quick thing I want to get out here.

1304
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:23,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason, one of our co-hosts, we sometimes have a guest host here on the show, and our lovely webmaster of OrangeOnStreet.com wanted me to plug this.

1305
01:34:24,014 --> 01:34:25,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And to this I say, but of course.

1306
01:34:26,255 --> 01:34:28,197
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of you are fans of the website GitHub.com?

1307
01:34:28,777 --> 01:34:33,421
[SPEAKER_05]: GitHub's a pretty awesome site for developers, programmers, and basically nerds.

1308
01:34:33,581 --> 01:34:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be honest.

1309
01:34:34,581 --> 01:34:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a super nerd site.

1310
01:34:35,902 --> 01:34:40,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, GitHub is going to be doing a game jam of their very own.

1311
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:48,052
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the entire month of November to create a web-based game, and it's got to be loosely built around one of these themes.

1312
01:34:48,692 --> 01:35:14,254
[SPEAKER_05]: forking that's forking like a spoon or a fork or forks branching or branches cloning or clones pushing or pulling what do we mean loosely based they mean loosely based like you could do a first-person shooter where you throw forks and so on and so on some of the prizes shiny new iPads with retina displays ooh ah github swag and so forth and you know featuring on the github blog

1313
01:35:14,594 --> 01:35:15,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Moth Game Moth

1314
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:46,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of this little moth with big rainbow wings flying around to ABBA.

1315
01:35:48,053 --> 01:35:48,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1316
01:35:48,813 --> 01:35:49,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well that's all I have.

1317
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, what's up next for you?

1318
01:35:52,216 --> 01:35:53,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I have more stuff.

1319
01:35:54,737 --> 01:35:55,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And a voice that's failing.

1320
01:35:56,839 --> 01:35:59,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition is coming out for PC for $19.90.

1321
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:03,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It has warp zones.

1322
01:36:05,165 --> 01:36:05,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, warp zones.

1323
01:36:06,205 --> 01:36:06,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1324
01:36:07,606 --> 01:36:31,650
[SPEAKER_02]: then um there is a uh uh nine minutes of footage up for the Mass Effect 3 uh prequel uh which is uh Paragon Lost which I think I'm like the only Mass Effect fan that's really excited about this so I don't know I'm gonna check it out it's Vega it's about Vega but oh hi Mariko um so uh you've got Freddie Prinze Jr.

1325
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:36,251
[SPEAKER_02]: you know playing Vega with his you know not very good you know

1326
01:36:37,771 --> 01:36:38,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish.

1327
01:36:39,573 --> 01:36:40,174
[SPEAKER_02]: That's loco.

1328
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:50,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But it should be, the actual DVD and Blu-ray will be out on December 28th in the US.

1329
01:36:50,948 --> 01:36:54,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there is not a date for the UK yet.

1330
01:36:56,388 --> 01:36:57,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can find the footage out.

1331
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:05,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is a Halloween bundle from Indie Royale.

1332
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:09,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It has Sam and Max, The Devil's Playhouse, the full season.

1333
01:37:11,015 --> 01:37:12,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It has Home.

1334
01:37:12,936 --> 01:37:17,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It has Pathologic, MacGuffin's Curse, and Evil Quest.

1335
01:37:19,559 --> 01:37:20,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you...

1336
01:37:22,105 --> 01:37:30,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay over $8, you also receive a FLAC or MP3 copy of C. Jeff's chiptune album, Preshtale.

1337
01:37:31,913 --> 01:37:32,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So there it goes.

1338
01:37:33,394 --> 01:37:38,238
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was hoping that McGuffin's Curse, I kind of read that as McGruff's Curse.

1339
01:37:38,539 --> 01:37:39,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a bite out of crime!

1340
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:45,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a noir, a film noir game starring McGruff, a crime dog.

1341
01:37:45,524 --> 01:37:47,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to McGruff, the crime dog?

1342
01:37:48,927 --> 01:37:51,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he got replaced with something more hip and young.

1343
01:37:53,789 --> 01:37:54,330
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I think?

1344
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,610
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you forgot to lock your door.

1345
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:56,351
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people do that.

1346
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:56,871
[SPEAKER_05]: They forget.

1347
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,515
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too bad because all crime needs is a chance.

1348
01:38:01,555 --> 01:38:02,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give it the chance.

1349
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,460
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my job to teach you to protect yourselves.

1350
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it your job to learn.

1351
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:28,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Write to Box 6600 Rockville, Maryland.

1352
01:38:29,228 --> 01:38:30,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and one more thing.

1353
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:33,755
[SPEAKER_00]: Lock your door and take a bite out of crime.

1354
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,863
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand, like, that was a commercial on TV.

1355
01:38:40,183 --> 01:38:41,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Lock your damn door.

1356
01:38:41,564 --> 01:38:44,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, when I was a little kid, we actually didn't lock our doors that much.

1357
01:38:44,908 --> 01:38:45,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

1358
01:38:45,768 --> 01:38:46,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's true.

1359
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:52,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Growing up, you know, and it was different times, and especially if you lived somewhere a little more rural, there's still a lot of places like that.

1360
01:38:52,755 --> 01:38:53,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't live somewhere rural.

1361
01:38:53,756 --> 01:38:54,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in the suburbs.

1362
01:38:54,697 --> 01:38:56,799
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of places still like that.

1363
01:38:56,859 --> 01:38:57,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1364
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:58,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That they don't lock their doors at night.

1365
01:38:58,961 --> 01:39:01,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, McGruff would like you to take a bite out of crime.

1366
01:39:03,501 --> 01:39:04,343
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1367
01:39:12,912 --> 01:39:16,154
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a McGruff the Crime Dog monster truck.

1368
01:39:17,915 --> 01:39:22,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in chat says, I remember when McGruff the Crime Dog came to my elementary school.

1369
01:39:22,458 --> 01:39:24,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he take a bite out of the principal?

1370
01:39:26,181 --> 01:39:30,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Stan says he was fired when they found a dead prostitute in McGruff's car.

1371
01:39:30,684 --> 01:39:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, that answers everything.

1372
01:39:32,265 --> 01:39:32,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1373
01:39:32,665 --> 01:39:34,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always the dead prostitutes.

1374
01:39:34,046 --> 01:39:35,427
[SPEAKER_05]: They find themselves everywhere.

1375
01:39:35,507 --> 01:39:36,948
[SPEAKER_05]: God, they ruin everything.

1376
01:39:37,148 --> 01:39:38,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn those dead prostitutes.

1377
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:41,551
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's take a bite out of the Fugle Question of the Week.

1378
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:50,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1379
01:40:09,389 --> 01:40:13,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us a story about a time when game over came too soon.

1380
01:40:14,114 --> 01:40:20,020
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, have you ever had an experience where you were really into playing a video game and then suddenly the power went out?

1381
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:21,321
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet went out.

1382
01:40:21,741 --> 01:40:24,144
[SPEAKER_05]: A parent came in and turned off the system while you were playing.

1383
01:40:24,504 --> 01:40:25,485
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you react?

1384
01:40:26,927 --> 01:40:28,348
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, I'll get to the host in a minute.

1385
01:40:28,408 --> 01:40:29,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, something just popped into my head.

1386
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:30,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with Actdeft.

1387
01:40:31,644 --> 01:40:32,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1388
01:40:52,787 --> 01:40:54,209
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you get for talking all that smack.

1389
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:56,530
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1390
01:40:58,012 --> 01:40:58,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1391
01:40:58,812 --> 01:41:00,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Panaxium answers the question.

1392
01:41:00,293 --> 01:41:03,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, for me, it was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

1393
01:41:03,736 --> 01:41:07,579
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to beat that obnoxious final boss for over an hour.

1394
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:15,485
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was finally about to beat the damn thing, my dad gracefully trips over the GameCube cables, yanking the power out of it.

1395
01:41:15,886 --> 01:41:19,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember doing a Vader style, no!

1396
01:41:19,328 --> 01:41:19,368
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

1397
01:41:20,129 --> 01:41:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: He looked at the blank screen a few seconds, then turned to me with a big dorky grin and said, Sorry, I'm prone to power trips.

1398
01:41:29,512 --> 01:41:30,492
[SPEAKER_02]: That was horrible.

1399
01:41:33,593 --> 01:41:35,293
[SPEAKER_05]: That was some punishment for the show.

1400
01:41:39,294 --> 01:41:40,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for that, Dad.

1401
01:41:45,296 --> 01:41:47,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm prone to power trips.

1402
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:51,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1403
01:41:52,791 --> 01:41:55,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Facebook to get some of the questions here.

1404
01:41:56,173 --> 01:41:56,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1405
01:41:57,454 --> 01:42:06,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Brandon H answered the question and said, Just unlocked everything in Guitar Hero 3, then in the middle of saving the power went out, and then it came back on.

1406
01:42:07,081 --> 01:42:09,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Red ring of death and corrupted saves.

1407
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:16,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a really bad day, to have your machine red ring of death on top of the power failure and corrupt your saves.

1408
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:18,170
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.

1409
01:42:20,059 --> 01:42:20,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, let's see.

1410
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Joe G answers on Facebook and says, Oh, excuse me.

1411
01:42:24,802 --> 01:42:25,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I used the wrong name.

1412
01:42:25,543 --> 01:42:27,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to put it at the beginning or I might miss it.

1413
01:42:27,404 --> 01:42:30,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Haseo Sumerogawa says, I was playing Borderlands.

1414
01:42:30,926 --> 01:42:40,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot and I was playing the last arena there and was about three quarters of the way through and I had finished all other quests from the games and Zombie Island is rolling.

1415
01:42:41,092 --> 01:42:44,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I died, got booted out, and I played the whole thing offline, mind you.

1416
01:42:44,855 --> 01:42:46,656
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I died, I was shit out of luck

1417
01:42:47,136 --> 01:42:57,043
[SPEAKER_05]: and what the fuck did the autosave and power flipped off corrupting the save data and I think people in Texas heard me yelling obscenities.

1418
01:42:58,904 --> 01:43:06,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Burr replies, Growing up, I always remember getting kicked off the computer mid-game because my mom wanted me to take a break and go outside.

1419
01:43:06,986 --> 01:43:14,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I always end up spending my time away from the game thinking about what was going to happen next, and it would continue on to the next day during school.

1420
01:43:14,409 --> 01:43:18,650
[SPEAKER_05]: You can physically separate a gamer from their drug, but you can't keep it out of their mind.

1421
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:25,713
[SPEAKER_05]: James S replied and said, when I was about six years old, I was playing Yoshi's Cookie on the original Game Boy.

1422
01:43:26,213 --> 01:43:27,954
[SPEAKER_05]: That game was awesome, just saying.

1423
01:43:28,314 --> 01:43:29,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that game on the SNES.

1424
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Earmark that for a classic game some weeks.

1425
01:43:32,776 --> 01:43:33,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Yoshi's Cookie.

1426
01:43:34,377 --> 01:43:43,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of frustration on a high level, I proceeded to rage and I slammed the Game Boy against my head, causing the screen to shatter instantly.

1427
01:43:44,332 --> 01:43:45,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep in mind, I was six.

1428
01:43:46,413 --> 01:43:50,076
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never been so mortified yet satisfied in my entire life.

1429
01:43:51,377 --> 01:43:51,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.

1430
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:57,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever, like, has your rage ever broken something that was like several hundred dollars like that?

1431
01:43:57,581 --> 01:44:01,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan, back in the day, would break controllers.

1432
01:44:01,684 --> 01:44:03,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And one time he took a controller back.

1433
01:44:04,366 --> 01:44:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: He bought a new controller and then returned the controller, except he returned the broken controller.

1434
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:32,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was like a Saturn controller wow Ronnie B answered and said when I first moved to where I am now the breakers would trip every day often erasing hours of my Civ progress on the 360 I also hate when broken games often downloadable games glitch so badly the only option is to restart due to locked menus stuck cameras or whatever

1435
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,770
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100 Matt with an arcade answer.

1436
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:36,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this.

1437
01:44:36,971 --> 01:44:44,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Back when I used to play a lot of Initial D in the arcade during my college years, I once lost my entire record and stats for my main car in the game.

1438
01:44:45,175 --> 01:44:53,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the process of transferring my data from Initial D2 to Initial D3 and the machine errored out and my card got jammed inside the machine.

1439
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:59,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Since my Initial D2 card was already voided because of the transfer, I lost everything.

1440
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:18,793
[SPEAKER_05]: several months worth of work on my main car was gone forever needless to say I was frustrated but after it happened I quit playing Initial D all the work that went into building that one car and then losing it got rid of my inspiration and drive pun intended to play the game anymore then

1441
01:45:20,987 --> 01:45:22,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, I'm going to do one more answer here.

1442
01:45:23,129 --> 01:45:23,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says,

1443
01:45:38,447 --> 01:45:38,928
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1444
01:45:58,248 --> 01:45:59,068
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some good answers.

1445
01:45:59,088 --> 01:46:00,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't read everything.

1446
01:46:00,148 --> 01:46:00,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1447
01:46:00,989 --> 01:46:07,310
[SPEAKER_05]: But go check out the rest of the answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or our Google Plus community.

1448
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:11,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around the room and see if anybody has things to share.

1449
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:13,292
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, I know you said you had something.

1450
01:46:13,512 --> 01:46:19,033
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was in high school, my little brother Matthew got hit by a car.

1451
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:20,993
[SPEAKER_02]: He was six.

1452
01:46:22,134 --> 01:46:27,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And that night, basically, I got dropped off at the mall with my best friend Jennifer.

1453
01:46:29,296 --> 01:46:54,112
[SPEAKER_02]: and we went to the movies, went to the arcade because basically there's like here's some money and I ended up getting in on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game in the arcade and we, this is the first time I'd ever played a full four player game they had me on Leonardo so I was like okay he's kind of cool and we got all the way to the end of the game had just got the last hit and they shut off the machines

1454
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: We were all like, no!

1455
01:46:59,947 --> 01:47:00,668
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty bad.

1456
01:47:02,443 --> 01:47:03,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, can you think of a story?

1457
01:47:03,864 --> 01:47:04,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one while you're thinking.

1458
01:47:06,426 --> 01:47:09,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a lot of good ones, but do you know how old NES is?

1459
01:47:10,448 --> 01:47:16,332
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to blow on the cartridge to get it to work, and then sometimes the game would just spontaneously reset, like right in the middle.

1460
01:47:16,793 --> 01:47:20,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that happened to us the night my friend and I decided to play Super Mario Bros.

1461
01:47:21,015 --> 01:47:24,618
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 from start to finish with no warping, around like World 6 or 7.

1462
01:47:25,538 --> 01:47:32,323
[SPEAKER_05]: If something hit the ground too hard, which I think is what happened, I think we dropped something on the ground, and it just threw everything off balance enough so it was like, reset!

1463
01:47:33,964 --> 01:47:35,164
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1464
01:47:36,805 --> 01:47:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was ruined.

1465
01:47:38,465 --> 01:47:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And we gave up and moved on.

1466
01:47:40,326 --> 01:47:40,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1467
01:47:40,906 --> 01:47:44,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have anything that I remember as far as power outages and stuff like that.

1468
01:47:45,148 --> 01:47:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I can remember is that I was making a pretty awesome...

1469
01:47:49,289 --> 01:47:50,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1470
01:48:06,618 --> 01:48:13,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we take a moment to remind our listeners of the mutual love we have for the game ZZT?

1471
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish there was something like that again.

1472
01:48:15,581 --> 01:48:16,521
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still Megazooks.

1473
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:17,701
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still out there.

1474
01:48:17,721 --> 01:48:19,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they still make stuff for ZZT?

1475
01:48:19,722 --> 01:48:20,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Megazooks.

1476
01:48:20,982 --> 01:48:21,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right.

1477
01:48:21,822 --> 01:48:22,303
[SPEAKER_05]: The new one.

1478
01:48:22,783 --> 01:48:23,483
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.

1479
01:48:24,795 --> 01:48:25,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, sorry, DarkSakura.

1480
01:48:25,755 --> 01:48:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, he said the magic word.

1481
01:48:27,136 --> 01:48:28,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1482
01:48:29,097 --> 01:48:34,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I one time spent four hours working on a sim house and forgot to save, and then the power went out.

1483
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,120
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have a VOGZZT contest.

1484
01:48:38,661 --> 01:48:39,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I've thought about it.

1485
01:48:39,661 --> 01:48:40,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I seriously have.

1486
01:48:40,762 --> 01:48:42,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I would be the only ones that would enter.

1487
01:48:42,442 --> 01:48:43,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, unfortunately.

1488
01:48:44,591 --> 01:48:45,052
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

1489
01:48:45,553 --> 01:48:46,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Prove me wrong.

1490
01:48:46,755 --> 01:48:51,602
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's interest in a ZZT VOG contest, email the show and tell us you're interested.

1491
01:48:51,642 --> 01:48:52,504
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd participate.

1492
01:48:52,884 --> 01:48:54,727
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will put something together.

1493
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:56,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1494
01:48:57,543 --> 01:49:00,466
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, just a few more stories for you guys, then we're going to get to listless tonight.

1495
01:49:00,486 --> 01:49:01,427
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, Loki.

1496
01:49:01,928 --> 01:49:04,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So the PS3's been hacked again, sort of.

1497
01:49:05,211 --> 01:49:12,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what happened was a hacker group called the Three Musketeers finally released the level zero keys.

1498
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And not necessarily the way to get those keys themselves, but...

1499
01:49:17,364 --> 01:49:17,884
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1500
01:49:41,651 --> 01:49:49,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think that's why it has to run on the 355 firmware, because anything newer doesn't use those keys anymore.

1501
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:57,168
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, for compatibility's sake, they need to have everything, you know, use those keys at some point.

1502
01:49:57,328 --> 01:49:58,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1503
01:49:58,769 --> 01:50:02,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's been so long since I've looked into the hacking stuff, it's... I don't know.

1504
01:50:03,334 --> 01:50:17,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But, apparently, this is supposed to be unpatchable as far as they can keep using this exploit to forever have custom firmwares on PS3 and run new games and stuff like that.

1505
01:50:18,505 --> 01:50:20,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's kind of interesting.

1506
01:50:21,687 --> 01:50:24,349
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll have to see if that's actually going to happen.

1507
01:50:24,449 --> 01:50:27,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But as of right now, they haven't really released any new...

1508
01:50:30,225 --> 01:50:32,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I have to double check that.

1509
01:50:33,632 --> 01:50:40,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say I saw something about a custom firmware for 4.3 come out.

1510
01:50:40,446 --> 01:50:41,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see here.

1511
01:50:44,404 --> 01:50:47,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Debug firmware for 4.25 has been leaked.

1512
01:50:54,289 --> 01:50:55,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.

1513
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:56,730
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this?

1514
01:50:58,611 --> 01:50:59,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Homebrew for custom firmware 4.21.

1515
01:50:59,772 --> 01:51:00,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Updated DMCA.

1516
01:51:00,072 --> 01:51:00,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

1517
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does this really mean?

1518
01:51:14,222 --> 01:51:16,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to be like rampant piracy on the PS3 now?

1519
01:51:16,728 --> 01:51:17,470
[SPEAKER_03]: No more than it already is.

1520
01:51:17,530 --> 01:51:20,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means that they're going to be able to keep doing it.

1521
01:51:21,659 --> 01:51:22,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

1522
01:51:23,314 --> 01:51:51,666
[SPEAKER_03]: alrighty I would say you have to have I think a firmware that's like 355 or lower which I don't remember what mine is right now because I haven't updated in a long time so I don't think I'm 355 I think I'm newer than that but you know if you have an older firmware then that means that you'll be able to translate the old ones so that they can run like a custom firmware on those or based off those

1523
01:51:52,597 --> 01:51:59,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know the old saying we have on the show, hackers gonna hack, but at least no personal information stolen, right?

1524
01:51:59,588 --> 01:52:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that kind of hack?

1525
01:52:00,819 --> 01:52:01,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that kind of hack.

1526
01:52:01,919 --> 01:52:08,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because a lot of people were... I think there's some misinformation out there because people were saying, did it get hacked again?

1527
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:10,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation got hacked again?

1528
01:52:11,321 --> 01:52:13,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that kind of hack, right?

1529
01:52:13,862 --> 01:52:14,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1530
01:52:14,762 --> 01:52:15,062
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1531
01:52:15,842 --> 01:52:19,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to get into another story here on a completely different note.

1532
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:28,805
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that has me very excited, and I want to see if this is something maybe a few of you out there can recognize by the music, which I love the soundtrack to this game.

1533
01:52:32,014 --> 01:52:32,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone recognize this?

1534
01:52:33,819 --> 01:52:38,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, if you played this game as much as I did, you probably heard this song a lot more.

1535
01:52:42,099 --> 01:52:45,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadowgate, Shadowgate, Shadowgate, Shadowgate, Shadowgate

1536
01:53:08,519 --> 01:53:13,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that.

1537
01:53:13,322 --> 01:53:19,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, they worked on the original Shadowgate with ICOM simulations 25 years ago.

1538
01:53:19,706 --> 01:53:21,507
[SPEAKER_05]: They've started this new company.

1539
01:53:21,827 --> 01:53:26,870
[SPEAKER_05]: They bought the rights to the old Shadowgate game, and Uninvited, and Deja Vu, apparently.

1540
01:53:28,031 --> 01:53:48,767
[SPEAKER_05]: and also got the rights to the 8-bit soundtrack which apparently was done by somebody completely different it was done by a Japanese guy who I guess maybe in the port of the games over to the NES maybe it was done there so like if you listen to the trailer for Shadowgate it has like a newer version of that music which is awesome let me see if I can play a little bit of this for you but yeah um

1541
01:53:49,588 --> 01:53:50,789
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a Kickstarter for this.

1542
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:55,694
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be redesigned puzzles and an expanded storyline.

1543
01:53:55,734 --> 01:53:59,117
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the plot devices from the original game will still be there.

1544
01:53:59,497 --> 01:54:03,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And like in the trailer, you can definitely see the room with the lake.

1545
01:54:03,341 --> 01:54:05,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you used to put the orb in the lake to freeze it.

1546
01:54:05,322 --> 01:54:08,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the room with the dragon breathing fire at the other end.

1547
01:54:08,765 --> 01:54:10,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's all of that in there.

1548
01:54:11,088 --> 01:54:13,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So very, very cool that they're doing this.

1549
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:14,170
[SPEAKER_05]: They are seeking $120,000.

1550
01:54:16,112 --> 01:54:21,133
[SPEAKER_05]: to do versions for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.

1551
01:54:21,533 --> 01:54:29,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do $10 right now to get a DRM-free, and they're really emphasizing that, a DRM-free download when the game comes out.

1552
01:54:29,555 --> 01:54:39,757
[SPEAKER_05]: They are projecting 2013 November for that, so it is gonna be a bit of a wait, but I will say this, this is only the second Kickstarter ever that I've given money to.

1553
01:54:39,957 --> 01:54:41,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I did donate to this Kickstarter because...

1554
01:54:42,157 --> 01:54:43,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like Shadowgate.

1555
01:54:44,059 --> 01:54:48,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked those old ICOM games, so I'm really excited about this.

1556
01:54:49,002 --> 01:54:50,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this, though.

1557
01:54:51,784 --> 01:54:53,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have so much money.

1558
01:54:53,346 --> 01:54:57,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't do the $130 or more, but that did sound really cool.

1559
01:54:57,709 --> 01:54:59,850
[SPEAKER_05]: An original Shadowgate card game.

1560
01:55:00,831 --> 01:55:01,852
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have been kind of cool.

1561
01:55:01,992 --> 01:55:04,533
[SPEAKER_05]: But a little bit out of my price range, personally.

1562
01:55:04,573 --> 01:55:08,555
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm sure there's people already... It's already up to $41,000.

1563
01:55:09,575 --> 01:55:09,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound again.

1564
01:55:09,975 --> 01:55:10,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me fast forward.

1565
01:55:10,816 --> 01:55:12,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to do this part of the trailer here.

1566
01:55:21,914 --> 01:55:48,031
[SPEAKER_05]: so you can tell they're like totally like which is pretty awesome there's the wraith i remember that from one scene so you definitely see the artwork is gorgeous oh yeah i would pay for this just for the artwork yeah it's it's it's gorgeous so um yeah zojoy is the name of the company that is putting this together that uh these guys started so good luck to them and obviously as a fan of these games since i was a kid i hope they do it i really want it so very cool

1567
01:55:49,728 --> 01:55:50,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with some more news.

1568
01:55:50,869 --> 01:55:53,150
[SPEAKER_05]: One more story and then we're going to get to Listless tonight.

1569
01:55:53,230 --> 01:55:53,750
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.

1570
01:55:55,271 --> 01:55:56,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I do have another story, don't I?

1571
01:55:56,712 --> 01:55:57,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

1572
01:55:57,952 --> 01:56:01,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about the game Waking Mars?

1573
01:56:02,275 --> 01:56:06,337
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was an iOS ecological puzzle adventure game.

1574
01:56:06,937 --> 01:56:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be coming out to PC, Mac, Linux, and Android on November 6th.

1575
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:16,922
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a revamped version done by Tiger Style Games.

1576
01:56:17,703 --> 01:56:25,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to have high def with voice acting throughout the game and be just a great big step up from the iOS version.

1577
01:56:25,808 --> 01:56:36,414
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this was really interesting to me is that they specifically listed Linux among the platforms, which I think is great Linux getting more attention.

1578
01:56:37,815 --> 01:56:42,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, a lot of people kind of giving Mars attention with the whole curiosity and all that, right?

1579
01:56:44,002 --> 01:56:44,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is that too.

1580
01:56:46,386 --> 01:56:52,538
[SPEAKER_02]: But I... This is a game that I kind of had my eye on to play for a little while and I just never went back for it.

1581
01:56:52,658 --> 01:56:52,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It...

1582
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:55,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, so sorry.

1583
01:56:57,056 --> 01:57:02,397
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a game that was supposed to have really shown off just how great iOS can be programmed.

1584
01:57:03,337 --> 01:57:06,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'm definitely going to play this on PC.

1585
01:57:07,138 --> 01:57:07,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

1586
01:57:08,459 --> 01:57:09,299
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to tell me how it is.

1587
01:57:09,839 --> 01:57:11,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm waiting for your review before I check it out.

1588
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1589
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:12,580
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1590
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to that time, folks.

1591
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:16,561
[SPEAKER_05]: It is time to bring this segment back.

1592
01:57:16,601 --> 01:57:17,761
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been forever since we've done it.

1593
01:57:17,801 --> 01:57:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It is time to play Listless.

1594
01:57:23,683 --> 01:57:30,405
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've never heard Listless before, what we're going to do tonight is we are going to create the definitive list, the definitive answer.

1595
01:57:30,425 --> 01:57:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a highly scientific process, the definitive list around a topic.

1596
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:37,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's how it'll work, and I'll tell you the topic in a minute.

1597
01:57:37,047 --> 01:57:38,668
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be four of us playing tonight.

1598
01:57:39,628 --> 01:57:46,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a special guest join us here, so everybody help me welcome to the show or welcome back to the show, Alan.

1599
01:57:46,910 --> 01:57:47,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey.

1600
01:57:47,770 --> 01:57:48,451
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing, Alan?

1601
01:57:48,771 --> 01:57:49,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

1602
01:57:49,471 --> 01:57:52,053
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so Alan is going to be playing listless with us tonight.

1603
01:57:53,094 --> 01:57:55,716
[SPEAKER_05]: The four of us will give our top three answers.

1604
01:57:56,196 --> 01:57:57,417
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to leave us a list of 12.

1605
01:57:58,257 --> 01:58:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to go around the room and each eliminate one answer.

1606
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:04,802
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really tough thing we got to do, but it's part of the process.

1607
01:58:05,142 --> 01:58:06,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to leave us with a list of eight.

1608
01:58:07,384 --> 01:58:17,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And then those of you in the chat room will vote on those final eight answers and help us come up with our definitive list of the top three answers to this topic.

1609
01:58:17,431 --> 01:58:17,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1610
01:58:18,972 --> 01:58:27,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Earlier in the show, we talked about that G4 is losing its last bit of video game programming and that it will no longer be a video game network.

1611
01:58:28,058 --> 01:58:31,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of us have thrown up our hands and said, I'm done.

1612
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:31,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm out.

1613
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:32,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Later.

1614
01:58:32,721 --> 01:58:33,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice knowing you, G4.

1615
01:58:34,282 --> 01:58:35,623
[SPEAKER_05]: So tonight's listless topic...

1616
01:58:36,443 --> 01:58:40,384
[SPEAKER_05]: The TV show that would make me watch G4 again.

1617
01:58:41,164 --> 01:58:42,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be an existing show.

1618
01:58:42,945 --> 01:58:44,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a new show.

1619
01:58:44,705 --> 01:58:46,186
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be anything you want.

1620
01:58:46,526 --> 01:58:49,527
[SPEAKER_05]: The show that would make me watch G4 again.

1621
01:58:49,887 --> 01:59:00,250
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give your suggestions in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com in case an answer should get duplicated or, you know, sometimes we just like the chat answers better than our own.

1622
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:05,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Make your suggestions in the chat room and we will read some of our favorite answers from chat.

1623
01:59:05,771 --> 01:59:09,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, TV show that would make me watch G4 again.

1624
01:59:10,795 --> 01:59:14,017
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's go around and start building the list.

1625
01:59:14,237 --> 01:59:16,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will start with Loki tonight.

1626
01:59:17,902 --> 01:59:23,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what is your number three answer for a show that would make you watch Chief Oregon?

1627
01:59:24,028 --> 01:59:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The brand new Iron Chef series that they're doing, the Japanese Iron Chef, but translated in English.

1628
01:59:32,016 --> 01:59:32,536
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1629
01:59:32,576 --> 01:59:36,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, to be fair, the Food Network probably has a lock on this show.

1630
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

1631
01:59:38,141 --> 01:59:38,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not yet.

1632
01:59:38,822 --> 01:59:40,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it hasn't started yet, so...

1633
01:59:41,204 --> 01:59:44,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's a pretty serious answer.

1634
01:59:44,306 --> 01:59:45,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I want new Japanese Iron Chef.

1635
01:59:45,447 --> 01:59:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, new Japanese Iron Chef.

1636
01:59:47,068 --> 01:59:47,588
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1637
01:59:48,789 --> 01:59:50,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to DarkSakura.

1638
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:52,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Your number three answer.

1639
01:59:52,391 --> 01:59:53,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Show that we get you to watch G4 again.

1640
01:59:54,312 --> 01:59:58,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, I never actually watched it, but I would go for Real Housewives Disney Edition.

1641
01:59:59,475 --> 02:00:00,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on SNL.

1642
02:00:03,660 --> 02:00:29,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So like an actual version of that sketch from SNL The Real Housewives of Disney Yeah, that's a good suggestion, I like that Alright, my number three answer tonight And I see people saying this in chat right now So chat and I are on the same page My number three answer is Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo Yes Where the contestants who don't do well at the games Will actually get electrified Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo

1643
02:00:32,354 --> 02:00:36,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say Nick Arcade, but that wouldn't make sense because it's Nick Arcade.

1644
02:00:40,844 --> 02:00:46,330
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so so far we have New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, and Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

1645
02:00:46,871 --> 02:00:52,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, what would be the number three answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again?

1646
02:00:54,853 --> 02:00:56,134
[SPEAKER_06]: A documentary special.

1647
02:00:56,334 --> 02:00:59,817
[SPEAKER_06]: We're responsible for Olivia Munn, and we're very, very sorry.

1648
02:01:00,237 --> 02:01:02,058
[SPEAKER_06]: A five-hour apology special.

1649
02:01:05,761 --> 02:01:06,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Good answer.

1650
02:01:06,202 --> 02:01:12,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to shorten that a little bit to Olivia Munn apology special.

1651
02:01:12,446 --> 02:01:15,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that would only be one movie, unfortunately, or a miniseries.

1652
02:01:16,189 --> 02:01:17,310
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be like a miniseries.

1653
02:01:17,590 --> 02:01:21,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And what things about Olivia Munn should be apologized for?

1654
02:01:22,854 --> 02:01:23,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen her face?

1655
02:01:25,522 --> 02:01:27,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's cold.

02:03:00,699 --> 02:03:02,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So I might have to vote for that.

1678
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:04,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you mean USA?

1679
02:03:04,361 --> 02:03:06,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't UHF like the Weird Al movie?

1680
02:03:08,119 --> 02:03:31,196
[SPEAKER_05]: A weird movie based off of the alternative band of TV radio that had channels on it, yeah Alright, alright My number two answer tonight for a show that would make me watch G4 again The Days of Our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera There you go, Days of Our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera You mean The Shitadel

1681
02:03:37,518 --> 02:03:41,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe, DarkSakura, I do not have your support on a Mass Effect soap opera.

1682
02:03:42,783 --> 02:03:43,424
[SPEAKER_05]: What is up with that?

1683
02:03:43,544 --> 02:03:44,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I would watch it.

1684
02:03:44,465 --> 02:03:44,865
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1685
02:03:44,926 --> 02:03:45,166
[SPEAKER_05]: See?

1686
02:03:45,766 --> 02:03:46,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You would watch it.

1687
02:03:46,447 --> 02:03:47,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Extra garris.

1688
02:03:47,648 --> 02:03:47,969
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1689
02:03:48,809 --> 02:03:54,555
[SPEAKER_05]: If Nickelodeon could have 15 as a soap opera, we can have Days of Our Citadel.

1690
02:03:55,056 --> 02:03:55,416
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1691
02:03:56,577 --> 02:03:59,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, your number two answer for the list.

1692
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:07,614
[SPEAKER_06]: How not to market something special 35 year old nerds They're loaded, they're loyal, they're distracted

1693
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:12,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you need to explain this one a little bit while I figure out how to shorten the answer.

1694
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:13,401
[SPEAKER_05]: What would this show be?

1695
02:04:13,841 --> 02:04:21,847
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole basis of the G4 channel model is let's appeal to adult geeks because they have money, they play video games.

1696
02:04:22,367 --> 02:04:25,909
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put shows on TV that they'll want to watch.

1697
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:31,013
[SPEAKER_06]: They still buy lots of video games each year and they're not watching this yet.

1698
02:04:31,813 --> 02:04:32,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We're confused.

1699
02:04:34,435 --> 02:04:36,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I shortened that to 35-year-old nerd special.

1700
02:04:36,998 --> 02:04:37,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that work?

1701
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:39,961
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, you and I turn 35 next year.

1702
02:04:40,001 --> 02:04:40,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point that out.

1703
02:04:40,742 --> 02:04:42,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You know something sad?

1704
02:04:42,885 --> 02:04:43,085
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1705
02:04:43,165 --> 02:04:44,747
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother Phillip yesterday turned 30.

1706
02:04:44,807 --> 02:04:46,649
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 26th, sorry, the other day.

1707
02:04:49,312 --> 02:05:03,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so so far we have on the list New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of Our Citadel, Mass Effect Soap Opera, and 35-Year-Old Nerd Special.

1708
02:05:03,878 --> 02:05:04,479
[SPEAKER_05]: It is time.

1709
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:06,359
[SPEAKER_05]: The number one answers.

1710
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:10,181
[SPEAKER_05]: The number one thing that would most make you watch G4.

1711
02:05:10,581 --> 02:05:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1712
02:05:11,582 --> 02:05:18,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, if they're going to compete with Spike, then really there's only one choice, and that is big-breasted bikini car wash.

1713
02:05:23,639 --> 02:05:27,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And how exactly would big-breasted bikini car wash be a show?

1714
02:05:28,041 --> 02:05:34,383
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just women washing cars and sudsing up each other with large breasts.

1715
02:05:36,783 --> 02:05:40,865
[SPEAKER_05]: And would Loki get to be a special correspondent that motorboats the boobies?

1716
02:05:41,205 --> 02:05:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be the host.

1717
02:05:41,905 --> 02:05:43,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be doing the play-by-play.

1718
02:05:46,066 --> 02:05:47,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelly will get to motorboat the boobies.

1719
02:05:50,090 --> 02:06:03,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love... Or you can just have me, like, you know, in the beginning of each episode, I'll drive up the car, honk the horn, cast a smile at the camera, and... I would love you and your wife to host this show, because your wife would just walk up to the ladies and be like, how did you let your boobies get so big?

1720
02:06:06,943 --> 02:06:08,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You have really big areolas.

1721
02:06:10,786 --> 02:06:12,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, DarkSakura.

1722
02:06:12,527 --> 02:06:15,508
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, that's just shameful.

1723
02:06:15,668 --> 02:06:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not going to be topless.

1724
02:06:17,489 --> 02:06:21,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that could be the whole web series, but you know.

1725
02:06:22,091 --> 02:06:23,671
[SPEAKER_05]: The unrated Blu-ray.

1726
02:06:23,771 --> 02:06:26,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine with topless car wash too, but you know.

1727
02:06:26,913 --> 02:06:27,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Big Breast.

1728
02:06:27,713 --> 02:06:30,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it doesn't say, well, they could start off with bikinis.

1729
02:06:31,494 --> 02:06:31,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1730
02:06:31,855 --> 02:06:34,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, but then we're getting the Playboy content there.

1731
02:06:34,216 --> 02:06:35,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to infringe on any of their rights.

1732
02:06:35,916 --> 02:06:38,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised you didn't do World Series of Strip Poker.

1733
02:06:38,597 --> 02:06:39,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I thought you'd be going.

1734
02:06:39,858 --> 02:06:40,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1735
02:06:40,638 --> 02:06:45,367
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura I would actually watch the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show if they did one.

1736
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:57,512
[SPEAKER_02]: because I love watching the Angry Video Game Nerd.

1737
02:06:58,493 --> 02:07:00,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I love watching his movie specials.

1738
02:07:00,415 --> 02:07:03,137
[SPEAKER_05]: You think it's time for the Angry Video Game Nerd crossover?

1739
02:07:03,437 --> 02:07:03,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time.

1740
02:07:03,998 --> 02:07:05,619
[SPEAKER_05]: From YouTubes to cable.

1741
02:07:05,639 --> 02:07:10,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost said ScrewAttack, but I think the Angry Video Game Nerd would be more marketable.

1742
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:11,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there you go.

1743
02:07:12,921 --> 02:07:18,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, my number one answer, and this is big, you guys.

1744
02:07:18,864 --> 02:07:23,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single one of you know that if this show was on G4, you'd be click, I am there.

1745
02:07:24,626 --> 02:07:28,948
[SPEAKER_05]: My number one answer is Loki's cosplay challenge.

1746
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:33,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand what that is.

1747
02:07:35,551 --> 02:07:36,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Who am I challenging?

1748
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:41,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It would basically go around to different anime conventions and interview people that are cosplay.

1749
02:07:42,442 --> 02:07:45,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the viewers would pick their favorite cosplay.

1750
02:07:46,023 --> 02:07:48,805
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the challenge would be that you have to imitate it.

1751
02:07:49,345 --> 02:07:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1752
02:07:50,985 --> 02:07:52,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'd watch that.

1753
02:07:54,027 --> 02:07:54,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I would.

1754
02:07:54,387 --> 02:07:54,927
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1755
02:07:54,987 --> 02:07:56,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's cosplay challenge.

1756
02:07:57,088 --> 02:07:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1757
02:07:58,688 --> 02:08:05,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, but not leastly, certainly not leastly, Alan, your number one answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again.

1758
02:08:07,004 --> 02:08:15,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to preface this response by saying that I used to watch Tech TV back in the very beginning when Adam Sessler, the host, extended play out in front of the Metreon.

1759
02:08:16,948 --> 02:08:17,748
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very cute.

1760
02:08:17,969 --> 02:08:18,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1761
02:08:19,709 --> 02:08:29,873
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one answer is Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira present Black Boxer Brief Boner Boxing, a Gaynor Telethon to please, please come out of the closet.

1762
02:08:37,156 --> 02:08:40,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I just shortened it to Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

1763
02:08:42,342 --> 02:08:43,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It works, right?

1764
02:08:44,624 --> 02:08:47,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, even though there was something about boxer briefs.

1765
02:08:47,147 --> 02:08:47,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1766
02:08:47,848 --> 02:08:51,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing works for me.

1767
02:08:51,512 --> 02:08:51,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1768
02:08:52,333 --> 02:08:55,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is, the list as it stands right now, the 12 on the list.

1769
02:08:56,475 --> 02:09:19,963
[SPEAKER_05]: New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of Our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap, 35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash, Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge, and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

1770
02:09:20,883 --> 02:09:25,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So, unfortunately, it is time to go around and take items off the list.

1771
02:09:25,965 --> 02:09:26,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's part of the process.

1772
02:09:27,046 --> 02:09:29,747
[SPEAKER_05]: It's painful, but science is painful.

1773
02:09:30,427 --> 02:09:31,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it for science.

1774
02:09:32,508 --> 02:09:34,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1775
02:09:34,769 --> 02:09:35,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of them, actually.

1776
02:09:38,133 --> 02:09:38,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Alan.

1777
02:09:40,355 --> 02:09:44,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do the... Let's get rid of the Olivia Munn apology special.

1778
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:47,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one-time special.

1779
02:09:47,601 --> 02:09:49,002
[SPEAKER_06]: She is on the Daily Show.

1780
02:09:49,062 --> 02:09:50,784
[SPEAKER_06]: She is fucking awful.

1781
02:09:51,044 --> 02:09:55,247
[SPEAKER_06]: They are responsible for her and they need to pay reparations.

1782
02:09:55,728 --> 02:09:56,749
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to pay.

1783
02:09:59,651 --> 02:10:00,171
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1784
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,933
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the game.

1785
02:10:03,197 --> 02:10:05,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why Jon Stewart is the best person on television.

1786
02:10:21,388 --> 02:10:26,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, the Olivia Munn apology special is gone, which makes sense.

1787
02:10:26,271 --> 02:10:27,551
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing left to apologize for.

1788
02:10:28,152 --> 02:10:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1789
02:10:31,133 --> 02:10:32,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash.

1790
02:10:34,155 --> 02:10:35,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, because...

1791
02:10:36,776 --> 02:10:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cliche.

1792
02:10:38,198 --> 02:10:41,280
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, why don't you have big-breasted monster truck driving or something?

1793
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:41,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

1794
02:10:42,842 --> 02:10:44,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We can have a network based on this.

1795
02:10:44,403 --> 02:10:45,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Big-breasted entertainment.

1796
02:10:46,585 --> 02:10:47,386
[SPEAKER_03]: The BBB.

1797
02:10:49,427 --> 02:10:51,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, my turn to eliminate something.

1798
02:10:52,470 --> 02:10:54,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to eliminate... Oh, this is hard.

1799
02:10:55,473 --> 02:11:02,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hate to do this, but DarkSakura, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling, has got to go.

1800
02:11:02,879 --> 02:11:03,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1801
02:11:03,639 --> 02:11:04,720
[SPEAKER_02]: You never watched it.

1802
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a wrestling person.

1803
02:11:06,261 --> 02:11:06,781
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty.

1804
02:11:06,901 --> 02:11:07,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just that.

1805
02:11:08,022 --> 02:11:08,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

1806
02:11:08,622 --> 02:11:11,164
[SPEAKER_05]: You have UPN for your wrestling needs or whatever.

1807
02:11:11,204 --> 02:11:12,004
[SPEAKER_05]: CW or whatever.

1808
02:11:12,024 --> 02:11:13,325
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's no more glow.

1809
02:11:13,585 --> 02:11:13,905
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1810
02:11:13,965 --> 02:11:14,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1811
02:11:14,866 --> 02:11:15,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1812
02:11:15,946 --> 02:11:16,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you forgive me?

1813
02:11:17,367 --> 02:11:18,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you forgive me if Pinkberry is involved?

1814
02:11:19,128 --> 02:11:19,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1815
02:11:19,528 --> 02:11:19,808
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1816
02:11:21,629 --> 02:11:24,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1817
02:11:27,188 --> 02:11:34,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Last time I did a list list, I would say that I would be the chat room's voice, because I'm infamous for getting rid of the things that they most want to win, like President Cat.

1818
02:11:35,358 --> 02:11:40,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to look at what they don't want to get rid of.

1819
02:11:41,164 --> 02:11:47,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say New Japanese Iron Chef, because I don't see that mentioned at all.

1820
02:11:48,727 --> 02:11:52,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, new Japanese Iron Chef, it is stricken from the list.

1821
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:58,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so there it is, you are left with... How did 35 year old Nerd Special survive?

1822
02:11:58,293 --> 02:11:59,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even understand that one still.

1823
02:11:59,994 --> 02:12:01,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you explain that one more time?

1824
02:12:01,935 --> 02:12:03,256
[SPEAKER_05]: We live it, don't resent it.

1825
02:12:07,565 --> 02:12:09,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, don't dream it.

1826
02:12:10,307 --> 02:12:10,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it.

1827
02:12:12,169 --> 02:12:13,029
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see.

1828
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:16,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the comments from the chat room.

1829
02:12:16,311 --> 02:12:20,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the answers from our chat room that did not make the cut.

1830
02:12:21,215 --> 02:12:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane kind of was on to something because Shane suggested hot guys playing games in underwear.

1831
02:12:27,579 --> 02:12:29,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And you sort of did do that one, right?

1832
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:31,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1833
02:12:31,502 --> 02:12:31,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1834
02:12:31,963 --> 02:12:36,206
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says, when G4 gets syndicated episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.

1835
02:12:36,226 --> 02:12:36,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

1836
02:12:37,266 --> 02:13:01,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Stan says The Late Show with GLaDOS Taiki says Clippy B's Drag Race Virtual Phil says RuPaul's PVP Bloodbath A lot of folks, Duke Nukem saying Arena, Portal, Icons, and the shows that actually were on G4 some time ago

1837
02:13:02,521 --> 02:13:04,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is one more time in chatters.

1838
02:13:04,502 --> 02:13:05,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It is time for you to vote.

1839
02:13:05,743 --> 02:13:10,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Send Rob Roberts a private message with your number one and number two pick.

1840
02:13:10,385 --> 02:13:10,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is.

1841
02:13:11,385 --> 02:13:28,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Real Housewives of Disney, Starrcade 2, Electric Boogaloo, The Screensavers, Days of Our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap Opera, 35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge, and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

1842
02:13:29,113 --> 02:13:29,693
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

1843
02:13:29,933 --> 02:13:31,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Shouldn't it be Black Boxer Boner Boxing?

1844
02:13:32,895 --> 02:13:35,937
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Black Boner Boxing, but Black Boner Boxing sounds better.

1845
02:13:35,957 --> 02:13:37,998
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes back to our reoccurring theme of Big Black Cock.

1846
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:43,701
[SPEAKER_05]: But remember, it's really guys in black boxer briefs wrestling with boners.

1847
02:13:43,761 --> 02:13:44,241
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

1848
02:13:46,182 --> 02:13:50,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam Sessler and Kevin Ferrer's Black Boxer Brief Boner Bonanza.

1849
02:13:52,185 --> 02:13:53,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Alliteration special.

1850
02:13:54,019 --> 02:13:56,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, send in your votes.

1851
02:13:56,261 --> 02:13:57,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Please vote now.

1852
02:13:58,042 --> 02:14:01,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Send a private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two pick.

1853
02:14:02,966 --> 02:14:07,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, and while we do that, it is time to go to the mailbag.

1854
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:09,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to read these tonight, DarkSakura, or do I need to?

1855
02:14:10,211 --> 02:14:10,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

1856
02:14:11,072 --> 02:14:12,153
[SPEAKER_04]: My voice is actually going.

1857
02:14:14,054 --> 02:14:22,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick some of our favorites to read here on air, except I haven't pulled up the mailbag yet.

1858
02:14:23,969 --> 02:14:25,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have it up, so I'll just go ahead and do it.

1859
02:14:26,691 --> 02:14:27,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I'm there.

1860
02:14:27,331 --> 02:14:27,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm there.

1861
02:14:27,631 --> 02:14:30,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to do... Okay, never mind.

1862
02:14:30,473 --> 02:14:30,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in it.

1863
02:14:32,193 --> 02:14:32,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1864
02:14:32,594 --> 02:14:33,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are we going to start tonight?

1865
02:14:34,054 --> 02:14:35,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you going to read all four?

1866
02:14:35,455 --> 02:14:36,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1867
02:14:36,516 --> 02:14:37,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I didn't know if you'd screen them or not.

1868
02:14:39,237 --> 02:14:40,398
[SPEAKER_05]: Professional radio, boys and girls.

1869
02:14:41,638 --> 02:14:42,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with AZHP.

1870
02:14:43,259 --> 02:14:44,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR crew.

1871
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:46,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I decided to check out a new anime called...

1872
02:14:47,913 --> 02:14:48,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Aoi?

1873
02:14:48,253 --> 02:14:49,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to say that word.

1874
02:14:49,595 --> 02:14:49,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Aoi?

1875
02:14:50,596 --> 02:14:50,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Aoi.

1876
02:14:51,236 --> 02:14:51,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Aoi.

1877
02:14:51,436 --> 02:14:52,077
[SPEAKER_05]: It means blue.

1878
02:14:52,437 --> 02:14:54,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Aoi Sekai no Chusen Dei.

1879
02:14:55,480 --> 02:15:01,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's touted as being a parody of the old console wars between Nintendo and Sega with gratuitous fan service.

1880
02:15:01,986 --> 02:15:03,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as I'm concerned, it delivers.

1881
02:15:04,368 --> 02:15:10,614
[SPEAKER_05]: It tells the story of the small country of Seigua fighting against Ninteldo for control of their continent.

1882
02:15:11,094 --> 02:15:22,421
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only on its first episode as of this writing, but so far they've introduced a number of somewhat easily recognizable, at least by DarkSakura, not sure how massively knowledgeable on classic Sega games Rob and Loki are, parody characters.

1883
02:15:22,901 --> 02:15:28,925
[SPEAKER_05]: A blue-haired protagonist named Gear, who is super speedy and is trying to avenge the death of his beloved friend Teal.

1884
02:15:29,585 --> 02:15:34,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I know Sonic and Tails, come on, cut me some slack here, cut me some slack here.

1885
02:15:34,728 --> 02:15:39,731
[SPEAKER_05]: A purple-haired sister, Nell, who is his emotional support, like Nii from Phantasy Star 2.

1886
02:15:40,292 --> 02:15:46,476
[SPEAKER_05]: The General Hermes, he has colored gems on her necklace, maybe a parody of columns.

1887
02:15:47,016 --> 02:15:51,439
[SPEAKER_05]: The rival lieutenant with little angel wings in her hair, Opal, based on Opa Opa.

1888
02:15:51,459 --> 02:15:52,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Opa Opa!

1889
02:15:52,140 --> 02:15:52,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Opa Opa!

1890
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:54,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Opa Opa.

1891
02:15:54,201 --> 02:16:00,065
[SPEAKER_05]: And a genius tactician, Tetraloff, who loves sticking a long stick into things to fill holes.

1892
02:16:00,525 --> 02:16:02,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you three guesses on what that's from.

1893
02:16:03,187 --> 02:16:03,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Pornography?

1894
02:16:06,452 --> 02:16:08,036
[SPEAKER_05]: A picture for the host's benefit.

1895
02:16:09,359 --> 02:16:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: A little picture there of all the characters.

1896
02:16:10,722 --> 02:16:12,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I need to see this.

1897
02:16:12,707 --> 02:16:13,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting this.

1898
02:16:13,388 --> 02:16:14,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the little monkey.

1899
02:16:16,553 --> 02:16:20,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's super dumb and has girls clothes coming off for pretty much no reason.

1900
02:16:21,936 --> 02:16:22,737
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all you need, right?

1901
02:16:22,757 --> 02:16:24,057
[SPEAKER_05]: That's classic TV right there.

1902
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:31,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main villain has a giant mustache, a sword with a mushroom shaped grip, and he rides a flying dragon.

1903
02:16:31,422 --> 02:16:33,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, look at how dumb he looks.

1904
02:16:34,723 --> 02:16:36,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it says no hot linking.

1905
02:16:37,725 --> 02:16:38,485
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you do?

1906
02:16:39,686 --> 02:16:39,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1907
02:16:39,986 --> 02:16:43,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to copy paste this link because it doesn't like me linking it.

1908
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:47,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, this is great radio when I copy-paste.

1909
02:16:48,867 --> 02:16:52,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna let you, because it's... So is it Alisekaino what?

1910
02:16:52,193 --> 02:16:53,214
[SPEAKER_02]: It's access it from the website.

1911
02:16:53,234 --> 02:16:54,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue World of what?

1912
02:16:54,236 --> 02:16:54,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1913
02:16:55,598 --> 02:16:56,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I don't know.

1914
02:16:57,201 --> 02:16:59,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Alisekaino Chushinde.

1915
02:17:01,310 --> 02:17:03,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know the first part's Blue World of something.

1916
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:10,357
[SPEAKER_05]: In conclusion, I highly recommend this anime because it's super dumb and pandering to people who like classic games and big boobs.

1917
02:17:10,717 --> 02:17:12,579
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figure it would be perfect for OLR.

1918
02:17:13,159 --> 02:17:13,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct!

1919
02:17:14,060 --> 02:17:14,300
[SPEAKER_05]: It is!

1920
02:17:14,320 --> 02:17:14,961
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be correct.

1921
02:17:15,782 --> 02:17:17,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen manga for this, I think.

1922
02:17:17,083 --> 02:17:17,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

1923
02:17:45,964 --> 02:17:48,806
[SPEAKER_02]: The design looks way familiar.

1924
02:17:50,127 --> 02:17:58,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too bad we didn't hear about that before we were talking about the G4 shows we'd like to see.

1925
02:17:58,613 --> 02:18:00,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to our next email, which is from Nutman.

1926
02:18:01,715 --> 02:18:04,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to give my condolences to Jamie after losing her cat.

1927
02:18:04,737 --> 02:18:08,120
[SPEAKER_05]: My dog I had for 13 years just passed away recently and it was awful.

1928
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:13,764
[SPEAKER_05]: We think she had a stroke at some point and she may have had many seizures before we could get her to the vet to be put to sleep.

1929
02:18:14,364 --> 02:18:17,788
[SPEAKER_05]: It was terrible and I wish that they would not have been the last memories I have of her.

1930
02:18:18,208 --> 02:18:25,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like Shermie, I butchered the name I'm sure, and they did spell it wrong, but that's okay, they tried, went peacefully during the night though.

1931
02:18:25,456 --> 02:18:29,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I could never talk about it on air like you, so massive kudos to having the courage to do that.

1932
02:18:29,581 --> 02:18:30,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would tear up.

1933
02:18:30,542 --> 02:18:31,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie did a very good job last week.

1934
02:18:31,874 --> 02:18:46,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I did have a pretty significant sniffle Losing a pet, and that was not the sinus infection either Losing a pet is something that only other pet owners can understand I hope you will feel better about this terrible situation soon, happy face

1935
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:50,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's been about a week and a half now.

1936
02:18:51,013 --> 02:19:03,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, like last night I was walking back to the bedroom to go to bed and I saw a shadow at my feet and my brain instantly went to it's Shermie and stepped over the shadow.

1937
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:06,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wait, that's not the cat.

1938
02:19:06,722 --> 02:19:08,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's getting slowly better.

1939
02:19:08,983 --> 02:19:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still have problems doing laundry, actually, because that was Shermie's room.

1940
02:19:13,966 --> 02:19:16,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, good excuse to make Dan do the laundry.

1941
02:19:16,648 --> 02:19:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1942
02:19:17,188 --> 02:19:17,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously.

1943
02:19:18,048 --> 02:19:18,389
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1944
02:19:18,829 --> 02:19:20,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Redertainment starts this email.

1945
02:19:20,429 --> 02:19:20,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Trainer.

1946
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:22,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Podcrafters.

1947
02:19:22,790 --> 02:19:25,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Does he have a thing for, like, Trainer in the Mass Effect games or is this another reference?

1948
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:26,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to know this.

1949
02:19:27,332 --> 02:19:28,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Redertainment wants to know.

1950
02:19:28,332 --> 02:19:29,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Podcrafters.

1951
02:19:29,553 --> 02:19:35,455
[SPEAKER_05]: After seeing Loki's Halloween costume on Twitter, which, by the way, Loki, amazing Halloween costume.

1952
02:19:35,475 --> 02:19:37,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you worn it yet or is that for work?

1953
02:19:37,655 --> 02:19:38,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for work.

1954
02:19:39,176 --> 02:19:40,637
[SPEAKER_05]: This question comes to mind.

1955
02:19:40,757 --> 02:19:44,319
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?

1956
02:19:44,979 --> 02:19:47,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is the Kigurumi I wore last year.

1957
02:19:48,241 --> 02:19:50,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I might wear it again this year due to its supreme awesomeness.

1958
02:19:51,322 --> 02:19:53,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay Care, Red Entertainment, Trainer.

1959
02:19:53,864 --> 02:19:54,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Sent from my iPad.

1960
02:19:54,864 --> 02:19:57,685
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, that's basically the animal pajamas.

1961
02:19:59,106 --> 02:19:59,706
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what those are.

1962
02:20:00,847 --> 02:20:02,548
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?

1963
02:20:04,039 --> 02:20:06,783
[SPEAKER_02]: My weirdest costumes have always been from my actual cosplay.

1964
02:20:12,692 --> 02:20:15,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think I've done anything weird for Halloween.

1965
02:20:17,070 --> 02:20:24,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I did go as a pirate wench, which was fun, because I walked around with a whip and just started smacking on my coworkers.

1966
02:20:24,394 --> 02:20:25,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and Halloween's about being slutty.

1967
02:20:26,595 --> 02:20:27,716
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't slutty at all.

1968
02:20:28,436 --> 02:20:36,540
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, you know, the bodice, that was about as slutty as it got, but it was a long skirt and big boots and a whip and my hat.

1969
02:20:39,902 --> 02:20:45,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried one time to wear, I was going to wear my bike in costume one year, but that would have just been cold.

1970
02:20:49,713 --> 02:20:50,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's see.

1971
02:20:51,074 --> 02:20:54,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to the next email from... Oh, I'm sorry.

1972
02:20:54,275 --> 02:20:55,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to answer the question, too.

1973
02:20:55,215 --> 02:20:56,856
[SPEAKER_05]: The weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween.

1974
02:20:57,276 --> 02:21:02,498
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was in eighth grade, I dressed as a bag lady, and I got sent to the principal's office because I hit a kid with my purse.

1975
02:21:02,898 --> 02:21:04,619
[SPEAKER_05]: But he had it coming.

1976
02:21:04,659 --> 02:21:05,559
[SPEAKER_05]: He was an asshole.

1977
02:21:05,619 --> 02:21:13,322
[SPEAKER_05]: He was one of those eighth grade bullies, and he dared to make a comment about my costume, and so I thwacked him with my purse, like a bag lady would do, right?

1978
02:21:15,523 --> 02:21:16,123
[SPEAKER_05]: He deserved it.

1979
02:21:17,984 --> 02:21:19,928
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you... Oh, you're sending one from... Oh, an email?

1980
02:21:22,013 --> 02:21:22,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1981
02:21:23,616 --> 02:21:28,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I'm like full up on messages right now, so look at that, because I've got to count the votes still.

1982
02:21:30,416 --> 02:21:30,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1983
02:21:30,976 --> 02:21:33,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, talking behind the scenes and no one could hear any of that anyway.

1984
02:21:33,538 --> 02:21:34,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.

1985
02:21:35,119 --> 02:21:37,260
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more email from Flaco Jones.

1986
02:21:37,501 --> 02:21:40,322
[SPEAKER_05]: He always emails Horde House, so I'm very happy to hear him crossing over here.

1987
02:21:40,722 --> 02:21:41,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Flaco Jones.

1988
02:21:41,523 --> 02:21:42,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR.

1989
02:21:42,424 --> 02:21:52,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard anyone else on the show bring it up and it's getting close to Halloween, so I thought I'd write in and give my review for Welcome to Silent Hill, The Haunted House, or Maze, as they call it, at Universal Studios.

1990
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:54,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I am glad to hear about this.

1991
02:21:54,611 --> 02:21:57,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone mentioned that to me, by the way, having seen it.

1992
02:21:57,613 --> 02:21:58,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Extover?

1993
02:21:58,233 --> 02:21:59,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he saw it.

1994
02:21:59,534 --> 02:22:01,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was X4, I think it was somebody else, but yeah.

1995
02:22:21,042 --> 02:22:21,763
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1996
02:22:40,416 --> 02:22:41,357
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1997
02:23:04,011 --> 02:23:06,252
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a great time and they did a fantastic job.

1998
02:23:06,372 --> 02:23:09,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It better be there next year because we can't wait to go back.

1999
02:23:09,493 --> 02:23:10,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Halloween, Flaco Jones.

2000
02:23:11,634 --> 02:23:13,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, bad news for Flaco Jones.

2001
02:23:13,495 --> 02:23:16,557
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie came in sixth place at the box office this week.

2002
02:23:18,037 --> 02:23:20,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Not looking good for any long-term memory.

2003
02:23:20,138 --> 02:23:23,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, if they invested all that money in it, who knows?

2004
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:25,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they will bring it back again next year.

2005
02:23:26,221 --> 02:23:27,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for emails tonight.

2006
02:23:27,501 --> 02:23:33,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us your emails for a future...

2007
02:23:35,591 --> 02:23:37,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Meanwhile, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.

2008
02:23:53,597 --> 02:23:55,257
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to my son, this infection.

2009
02:23:55,957 --> 02:23:56,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hate it.

2010
02:23:57,118 --> 02:23:58,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate my voice going.

2011
02:23:59,078 --> 02:24:00,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my really...

2012
02:24:03,022 --> 02:24:09,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I like having short hair, but it wasn't stacked quite right, so it's a little uneven in the back.

2013
02:24:11,929 --> 02:24:13,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that's it.

2014
02:24:13,851 --> 02:24:15,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and Origin, EA.

2015
02:24:18,334 --> 02:24:18,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2016
02:24:19,455 --> 02:24:20,616
[SPEAKER_03]: After you did my weekly headache.

2017
02:24:21,741 --> 02:24:22,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you have a headache again?

2018
02:24:22,982 --> 02:24:24,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I get them every Sunday.

2019
02:24:25,303 --> 02:24:26,563
[SPEAKER_03]: It's... I don't know what it's from.

2020
02:24:27,784 --> 02:24:28,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

2021
02:24:28,284 --> 02:24:29,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I stay up too late.

2022
02:24:29,405 --> 02:24:30,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're allergic to this show.

2023
02:24:30,905 --> 02:24:36,528
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's before I get to the show, so... It's not anything to do with the show, it's just... I get a headache.

2024
02:24:37,228 --> 02:24:42,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, an F you to not having enough hours in the day, because, like, I'm really... Like, we have not had time to go to the grocery store today.

2025
02:24:42,711 --> 02:24:44,792
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing so much, but... Eh.

2026
02:24:46,473 --> 02:24:46,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

2027
02:24:46,973 --> 02:24:47,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't complain about it.

2028
02:24:47,933 --> 02:24:49,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you were running around when I got here.

2029
02:24:50,003 --> 02:24:50,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2030
02:24:51,444 --> 02:24:52,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a 15-minute nap.

2031
02:24:53,425 --> 02:24:55,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was like, where are Loki's stories?

2032
02:24:56,527 --> 02:24:57,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But it all worked out.

2033
02:24:58,228 --> 02:25:04,812
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, Loki has another story for us before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2034
02:25:04,872 --> 02:25:05,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just yet.

2035
02:25:05,352 --> 02:25:07,553
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you know when here in a moment.

2036
02:25:07,753 --> 02:25:09,174
[SPEAKER_05]: But meanwhile, Loki.

2037
02:25:09,855 --> 02:25:13,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, apparently the Urban Outfitters is selling unlicensed Nintendo product.

2038
02:25:13,937 --> 02:25:14,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness!

2039
02:25:16,059 --> 02:25:16,640
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2040
02:25:17,761 --> 02:25:20,843
[SPEAKER_03]: How dare they not license stuff to sell?

2041
02:25:20,963 --> 02:25:22,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And all this, like, really random stuff.

2042
02:25:23,005 --> 02:25:26,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, considering Urban Outfitters is basically, like, apparel.

2043
02:25:27,008 --> 02:25:30,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's kind of not really something that I would see them selling.

2044
02:25:30,852 --> 02:25:44,243
[SPEAKER_03]: But, like, they're trying to sell Nintendo 64 controllers, USB Nintendo, or Super Nintendo controllers, and, like, Supaboy portable game console and one of those knockoff Super Nintendo things.

2045
02:25:46,215 --> 02:25:46,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2046
02:25:46,535 --> 02:25:56,045
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure why this is news, but we're talking about... Well, because it's knockoff shit, and it's at a major store, you know?

2047
02:25:56,185 --> 02:25:56,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2048
02:25:56,545 --> 02:26:02,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So, everybody sells those stupid knockoff Super Nintendo Genesis things.

2049
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:04,734
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all the indie game stores sell them.

2050
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:07,401
[SPEAKER_03]: and Urban Outfitters.

2051
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:08,541
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just weird.

2052
02:26:08,581 --> 02:26:13,323
[SPEAKER_03]: That just seems like Sears selling something like that.

2053
02:26:13,964 --> 02:26:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Who gives a shit that they're selling that?

2054
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:22,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to go run to Urban Outfitters right now after the show and check that out.

2055
02:26:22,855 --> 02:26:23,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

2056
02:26:24,116 --> 02:26:24,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

2057
02:26:26,137 --> 02:26:27,758
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I got a story for you guys here.

2058
02:26:27,978 --> 02:26:32,141
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a favorite game of mine getting an MMO, but there's a twist to it.

2059
02:26:32,781 --> 02:26:33,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't there always?

2060
02:26:33,682 --> 02:26:35,543
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Civilization MMO.

2061
02:26:35,623 --> 02:26:37,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, Civilization Online MMO.

2062
02:26:38,405 --> 02:26:40,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be available soon in Asia.

2063
02:26:42,499 --> 02:26:57,615
[SPEAKER_05]: FireAxis is working with XL Games a Korean studio that did the game Lineage you might have heard of that game it's like the biggest MMO in the world yes bigger than Warcraft they're going to create Civilization Online it is an online only game it's going to be in Asian markets soon

2064
02:26:58,796 --> 02:27:00,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're doing Civilization Online.

2065
02:27:00,357 --> 02:27:03,559
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't say a whole lot else about it, just otherwise the partnership there.

2066
02:27:03,999 --> 02:27:07,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of news about what is going to be in the game or anything like that.

2067
02:27:07,441 --> 02:27:13,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a little weird to me because Civ 5 you can already play online.

2068
02:27:13,284 --> 02:27:14,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So how does an MMO work?

2069
02:27:14,925 --> 02:27:16,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it like never stop?

2070
02:27:16,866 --> 02:27:20,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like an endless world that you can always explore?

2071
02:27:20,868 --> 02:27:22,488
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more things about this I'd like to know.

2072
02:27:22,508 --> 02:27:23,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one is...

2073
02:27:23,849 --> 02:27:25,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Why won't we get a version in the US?

2074
02:27:26,873 --> 02:27:27,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe E3?

2075
02:27:27,754 --> 02:27:30,197
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll announce some type of partnership to publish it here locally?

2076
02:27:30,257 --> 02:27:30,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

2077
02:27:31,138 --> 02:27:32,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'd like to be able to try this, you know.

2078
02:27:36,758 --> 02:27:41,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's going to do it for the news tonight, which means it is time to open up the Skype line!

2079
02:27:42,003 --> 02:27:46,587
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2080
02:27:46,687 --> 02:27:47,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us a call.

2081
02:27:47,628 --> 02:27:52,172
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about whatever you want to talk about in the news tonight or maybe something else.

2082
02:27:52,813 --> 02:27:57,797
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, we'll get to Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR or Loki.

2083
02:27:57,837 --> 02:28:01,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's anything you want to add here for last minute stories while we wait for some calls.

2084
02:28:01,761 --> 02:28:02,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how you doing?

2085
02:28:02,382 --> 02:28:04,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Bobby Hey, Bobby, good to hear from you.

2086
02:28:04,864 --> 02:28:05,504
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, buddy?

2087
02:28:29,773 --> 02:28:30,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing much.

2088
02:28:30,313 --> 02:28:32,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys were talking a lot about G4 earlier.

2089
02:28:32,374 --> 02:28:33,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we were.

2090
02:28:33,495 --> 02:28:36,316
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we dedicated a whole segment of our show to it tonight.

2091
02:28:37,056 --> 02:28:38,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't dedicate anything.

2092
02:28:39,257 --> 02:28:39,578
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2093
02:28:39,618 --> 02:28:40,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What's up with that?

2094
02:28:41,458 --> 02:28:48,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a little conflicted just because of my past and stuff with G4, and I'm trying to figure out how I want to say what I want to say.

2095
02:28:49,462 --> 02:28:53,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, for those that don't know, tell us a little bit about what the past is for you.

2096
02:28:54,384 --> 02:28:55,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so for those that...

2097
02:28:57,250 --> 02:29:04,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't, you know, well, I mean, obviously we came from All Games and Scott Rubin, but I had met Scott Rubin a long time before then.

2098
02:29:05,357 --> 02:29:06,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I met him in 97.

2099
02:29:07,498 --> 02:29:13,583
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was one of the people that started G4 after the first incarnation of All Games went away in the dot-com bust.

2100
02:29:14,460 --> 02:29:21,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was pretty much right there at the formation and creation of G4 as an outsider, as a volunteer.

2101
02:29:23,687 --> 02:29:30,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Back when we just knew it was something that a Disney guy was going to be starting with Comcast.

2102
02:29:30,872 --> 02:29:31,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all we knew about it.

2103
02:29:33,085 --> 02:29:41,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there when they launched the site in April of 2002 and the network didn't go on the air until for a couple months later, I think.

2104
02:29:42,489 --> 02:29:47,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I was there and I actually was the first forum moderator over the G4 forums.

2105
02:29:47,292 --> 02:29:49,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran the chat room for about two years.

2106
02:29:49,873 --> 02:29:54,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on the majority of the shows that were on G4 at some point.

2107
02:29:54,815 --> 02:29:59,040
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a VHS tape that's like 30 minutes long of every single time I was either mentioned or shown.

2108
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I never realized that you were actually on the network at some point.

2109
02:30:02,324 --> 02:30:03,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I never realized that.

2110
02:30:03,185 --> 02:30:03,545
[SPEAKER_07]: I was.

2111
02:30:04,146 --> 02:30:04,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I was the...

2112
02:30:05,999 --> 02:30:34,782
[SPEAKER_07]: for some of the shows I was like the backup caller because they had a talk show G4TV.com which was hosted by Scott Rubin and Laura Foy and Tina Wood and they taped they would do a live stream of their taping but since it was a TV show it was like a five hour taping and so we were all kind of in the audience and they would take calls and sometimes I would be the one who would call in and I'd work out with the producer what I talk about or I would be the backup if the guy that they wanted to call in flaked out

2113
02:30:35,754 --> 02:30:50,406
[SPEAKER_07]: and so I would have to make up stuff about games I've never played and act as a caller like there was one about Splinter Cell and you know me, I would never play Splinter Cell but I actually called into the show once it was still me, I wasn't playing a character or anything talking about Splinter Cell

2114
02:30:51,748 --> 02:30:52,448
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really funny.

2115
02:30:52,568 --> 02:30:56,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to make a minor correction to something you said because you said we came from all games.

2116
02:30:57,893 --> 02:31:02,838
[SPEAKER_05]: That was our previous home prior to this, but we had started elsewhere before.

2117
02:31:02,898 --> 02:31:06,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were around on our own live 365 thing when G4 started.

2118
02:31:06,761 --> 02:31:12,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were those viewers out there that was kind of little critical and cynical of what was going on on G4 television.

2119
02:31:12,907 --> 02:31:16,210
[SPEAKER_07]: I was also critical and cynical because I left.

2120
02:31:16,730 --> 02:31:18,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

2121
02:31:18,552 --> 02:31:33,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was basically, I mean, everybody... And it's kind of funny because my version of G4 is different from other people's version of G4 because I stopped my involvement with G4 about the same time Scott did, which was right after the Tech TV merger because I didn't like the way they handled it.

2122
02:31:33,666 --> 02:31:37,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And to a lot of people, when they say, oh, G4, they think the screensavers.

2123
02:31:37,489 --> 02:31:38,490
[SPEAKER_07]: They think Call for Help.

2124
02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:39,271
[SPEAKER_07]: They think X-Play.

2125
02:31:39,611 --> 02:31:40,472
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't G4.

2126
02:31:41,413 --> 02:31:42,214
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Tech TV.

2127
02:31:43,684 --> 02:31:54,496
[SPEAKER_07]: The G4 that I remember was mostly G4TV.com and Icons and Cinematek and Pulse and Portal and Arena and all those.

2128
02:31:56,118 --> 02:31:57,960
[SPEAKER_07]: They had some great ideas.

2129
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:04,467
[SPEAKER_07]: The execution was lacking just because of budget, but they didn't give them a chance to actually get the budget for any of those shows.

2130
02:32:07,472 --> 02:32:08,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Pringles Presents.

2131
02:32:09,535 --> 02:32:10,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was cheat.

2132
02:32:10,816 --> 02:32:11,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Pringles presented cheat.

2133
02:32:12,358 --> 02:32:19,466
[SPEAKER_07]: But what was interesting is because I actually did get to meet most of the hosts from the 2002 to 2004, including the illustrious Will Wheaton.

2134
02:32:20,267 --> 02:32:21,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And they all kind of knew who I was.

2135
02:32:22,549 --> 02:32:51,557
[SPEAKER_07]: just through the forum posts and stuff because they interacted some and I would be the liaison sometimes and a lot of them a lot of the hosts actually did know what they were talking about with video games which was the main complaint everybody had about the original G4 hosts is that they didn't know what they were talking about they were just reading a teleprompter two or three of them were reading teleprompter and didn't know but I could actually have intelligent conversations with the majority of the hosts of all the G4 shows about video games and that's one thing a lot of people didn't realize back before the merger

2136
02:32:52,850 --> 02:32:54,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think people didn't get that?

2137
02:32:54,750 --> 02:32:57,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think that got lost in translation?

2138
02:32:57,091 --> 02:32:58,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that overproduction?

2139
02:32:58,831 --> 02:33:05,072
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see Tigercloss in our chat says, the G4TV.com show was heavily scripted.

2140
02:33:05,373 --> 02:33:07,513
[SPEAKER_05]: The callers couldn't call in and call about whatever they wanted.

2141
02:33:07,573 --> 02:33:10,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that because maybe they took some of the organicness out of it?

2142
02:33:11,554 --> 02:33:17,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, because basically it was a video game channel being made by cable television executives.

2143
02:33:18,211 --> 02:33:35,476
[SPEAKER_07]: so they followed the cable television model they didn't know that much about video games they just they thought they knew the way to do it and that's one of the reasons Scott Rubin left was because he couldn't get into their head that they were doing it all wrong and they didn't listen to him because all he had done is web stuff he didn't know how cable industry worked

2144
02:33:36,138 --> 02:33:37,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh Crane and Jim Downs

2145
02:34:04,329 --> 02:34:10,631
[SPEAKER_07]: also worked with Sudo and the All Games Network, and Josh Crane became an executive at G4.

2146
02:34:10,651 --> 02:34:14,793
[SPEAKER_07]: He's no longer with them, and Jim Downs was a producer who was also no longer with the network.

2147
02:34:14,853 --> 02:34:26,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So none of them are with the network anymore, but there were some people that are still there, and I don't know if they're still going to be with the network after the change or what, because they kind of did more generic stuff with the TV network.

2148
02:34:27,017 --> 02:34:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, is there anybody still at G4 that was there at the very beginning?

2149
02:34:31,298 --> 02:34:37,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's one guy, his name's Derek, I'm not going to give his last name, but people who probably from the All Games era know who I'm talking about.

2150
02:34:37,325 --> 02:34:38,066
[SPEAKER_07]: He is still there.

2151
02:34:38,907 --> 02:34:40,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's the only one I really know of that is still there.

2152
02:34:41,910 --> 02:34:42,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2153
02:34:43,132 --> 02:34:49,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was also kind of from that pseudo-online, he might have been, I don't know if he was flown from New York, but I know he was one of Scott's friends.

2154
02:34:49,770 --> 02:35:02,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me ask this, I mean, you know, obviously this news has you a little conflicted because it is kind of rough to see the last remnants of G4 disappearing, but these shows were tech TV shows that are the last.

2155
02:35:02,786 --> 02:35:05,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So didn't this all kind of already end five years ago?

2156
02:35:05,979 --> 02:35:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it all, well, G4 to me ended in 2004.

2157
02:35:08,119 --> 02:35:11,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And I liked tech TV, too.

2158
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:12,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched both networks.

2159
02:35:12,260 --> 02:35:14,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I watched the screensavers every day on tech TV.

2160
02:35:15,201 --> 02:35:20,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason G4 bought, well, the reason, I'll kind of explain because you read some of my comments.

2161
02:35:20,642 --> 02:35:24,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Paul Allen, who was one of the VPs of Microsoft, he bought a lot of things.

2162
02:35:24,663 --> 02:35:29,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's the guy that started tech TV because he wanted a cable television network about technology.

2163
02:35:30,384 --> 02:35:31,064
[SPEAKER_07]: He got bored with it.

2164
02:35:32,148 --> 02:35:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: and said, you know, I know you guys are about to pull a profit and pull high ratings.

2165
02:35:35,529 --> 02:35:36,930
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Tech TV was on the rise.

2166
02:35:37,310 --> 02:35:38,050
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, but I'm bored.

2167
02:35:39,030 --> 02:35:40,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And Comcast is offering money, so I want it.

2168
02:35:40,711 --> 02:35:44,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And Comcast wanted Tech TV because G4 could not get on DirecTV.

2169
02:35:45,232 --> 02:35:45,612
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't.

2170
02:35:45,832 --> 02:35:47,213
[SPEAKER_07]: DirecTV rejected them.

2171
02:35:47,913 --> 02:35:49,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Said that we don't want your content.

2172
02:35:49,413 --> 02:35:50,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Tech TV was already on...

2173
02:35:51,550 --> 02:35:54,712
[SPEAKER_07]: DirectTV, so that was their Trojan horse.

2174
02:35:55,452 --> 02:36:03,738
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they became G4 Tech TV, and this is why they actually did that, because they could not change the type of network until they renegotiated the contract with DirectTV.

2175
02:36:04,758 --> 02:36:11,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order to be broadcast on TechTV's signal, they had to retain TechTV's type of content.

2176
02:36:12,543 --> 02:36:16,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why they kept the screensavers and kept some of the other TechTV-type stuff

2177
02:36:17,506 --> 02:36:24,139
[SPEAKER_07]: and became G4 Tech TV and then once they renegotiated the contract they went back to G4 interesting

2178
02:36:26,691 --> 02:36:51,226
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's funny, I told you I was going to tell this story in chat about one of my most famous acts one of the acts that has shaped cable television that I did or at least I claim to do and when I say this story, realize that at the time I believed this was true and to his credit, the other person played along and told me it was true

2179
02:36:51,966 --> 02:36:52,947
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2180
02:37:15,598 --> 02:37:19,000
[SPEAKER_07]: to help him get leverage over the director.

2181
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:20,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's two voices instead of just one.

2182
02:37:21,401 --> 02:37:31,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Because G4TV.com really devolved into what can we make Laura Foy and Tina Wood do to appease the teenager male demographic.

2183
02:37:31,785 --> 02:37:40,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why they did the challenges that had the gross ending to it or whatever, the humiliation at the end.

2184
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:42,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And

2185
02:37:43,432 --> 02:37:50,671
[SPEAKER_07]: In comes chat one day is somebody that I kind of remember from the old pseudo days from Shooters, which is one of the old All Games Network shows, Captain Emmy.

2186
02:37:51,876 --> 02:37:55,378
[SPEAKER_07]: and he was sitting there talking about how he didn't like where he was.

2187
02:37:55,398 --> 02:38:07,462
[SPEAKER_07]: He was working at some public access station or some real old TV station and I knew Scott was looking for a production assistant but Scott actually told me he didn't want me to come out for it because I wouldn't get paid enough.

2188
02:38:08,783 --> 02:38:14,865
[SPEAKER_07]: But I told Captain Emmy that, hey, Scott's looking for this guy for a production assistant.

2189
02:38:14,885 --> 02:38:16,386
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, oh, no, I couldn't ask him for that.

2190
02:38:16,406 --> 02:38:17,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, really.

2191
02:38:17,787 --> 02:38:19,447
[SPEAKER_07]: He's looking for somebody to fill the job.

2192
02:38:21,428 --> 02:38:25,049
[SPEAKER_07]: and Scott comes into chat and I'm like, hey Scott, Captain Emmy's looking for a job.

2193
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:27,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was, oh really?

2194
02:38:28,070 --> 02:38:34,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And to kind of tie the story together, Captain Emmy was the screen name for Kevin Pereira.

2195
02:38:35,653 --> 02:38:41,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe for the longest time, and to Kevin's credit, he agreed with me that I got him his job at G4.

2196
02:38:43,010 --> 02:38:50,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the real version is more like Kevin knew the job was open, he was coming into chat just to see when Scott was around to talk to him about it.

2197
02:38:50,856 --> 02:38:51,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But he...

2198
02:38:52,491 --> 02:38:57,914
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll play along and say that I kind of pointed him in the direction when I think that was the direction he was going in anyway.

2199
02:38:57,934 --> 02:38:59,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

2200
02:39:00,034 --> 02:39:06,057
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, in some ways you can blame me for Kevin even being hired at G4 in the first place.

2201
02:39:06,337 --> 02:39:11,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe thank you in the case of Alan and what he said during the listless segment tonight.

2202
02:39:11,179 --> 02:39:11,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2203
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:18,841
[SPEAKER_07]: The shows I liked on G4 the most were actually not produced by G4.

2204
02:39:18,901 --> 02:39:22,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Electric Playground and Judgment Day were from Greedy Productions.

2205
02:39:22,702 --> 02:39:23,562
[SPEAKER_07]: They're still in business.

2206
02:39:23,722 --> 02:39:28,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Electric Playground is actually the longest running television show about video games in the world.

2207
02:39:28,624 --> 02:39:29,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been running since 1995.

2208
02:39:31,805 --> 02:39:33,885
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually recently went daily.

2209
02:39:33,905 --> 02:39:35,026
[SPEAKER_07]: They're mainly Canadian.

2210
02:39:35,706 --> 02:39:40,209
[SPEAKER_07]: They're produced up in Vancouver and Judgment Day is actually just a reskinning of their show Reviews on the Run.

2211
02:39:40,769 --> 02:39:48,694
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 wanted something specific and so they took the Reviews on the Run footage that had Victor Lucas and Tommy Tallarico and put G4 graphics around it.

2212
02:39:49,134 --> 02:39:49,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all they did.

2213
02:39:49,895 --> 02:39:51,556
[SPEAKER_07]: So in Canada it was Reviews on the Run.

2214
02:39:52,096 --> 02:39:52,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it was Judgment Day.

2215
02:39:52,977 --> 02:39:59,241
[SPEAKER_07]: They still do Reviews on the Run and what's funny is Tommy Tallarico no longer does any of that stuff because he's so busy with Video Games Live.

2216
02:39:59,901 --> 02:40:27,710
[SPEAKER_07]: but one of the people that does reviews on Reviews on the Run was kind of like me in the same sense that we were in the G4 forums together and kind of attached to specific shows and personalities I attach to Scott Rubin, I do podcasts this guy, Jose Sanchez he went by Fubar attached himself to Victor Lucas and he now is one of the hosts on Reviews on the Run he was a production assistant there for Greedy for the longest time and worked his way up wow, that's awesome huh

2217
02:40:29,341 --> 02:40:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: well it's been story time with Bobby Blackwolf but this is this is good it's kind of neat to hear the history and I hope you do end up doing your piece for VOG Network about kind of reflecting on it gosh I'm trying to think what else to ask you with this thing but do you think there is a future for video game television do you think somebody else we don't know of yet could come in and start a video game network or is it just you know what no video game stuff is always going to be on the internet this is something always internet based

2218
02:41:00,201 --> 02:41:03,585
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only one way, I think.

2219
02:41:03,725 --> 02:41:05,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, I'm looking to Korea.

2220
02:41:06,127 --> 02:41:11,512
[SPEAKER_07]: The only way that we can get a video game channel is if esports takes off in America the way it's taken off in Korea.

2221
02:41:12,633 --> 02:41:14,075
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only way I think it'll happen.

2222
02:41:14,115 --> 02:41:18,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we're going to see a generic video game network like G4.

2223
02:41:18,579 --> 02:41:20,200
[SPEAKER_07]: G4 tried a whole bunch of different things.

2224
02:41:20,220 --> 02:41:21,882
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't have all new shows.

2225
02:41:21,922 --> 02:41:23,443
[SPEAKER_07]: They had one show that was a scripted show.

2226
02:41:24,304 --> 02:41:26,408
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was about and took place in MMOs.

2227
02:41:26,448 --> 02:41:31,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an early machinima show using a whole bunch of different MMOs to tell this overarching story.

2228
02:41:31,576 --> 02:41:37,506
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Portal and they tried stuff like that and it didn't really take off.

2229
02:41:38,522 --> 02:41:41,906
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't think anybody has the patience to make that take off.

2230
02:41:42,566 --> 02:41:56,180
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think with esports, I think if esports does take off, if League of Legends takes off or StarCraft or something we don't know about yet, we may be able to get a dedicated esports channel, but that's probably as close as we're going to be able to get.

2231
02:41:57,513 --> 02:42:04,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I would see it probably ending up more being an esports show on the Ocho, you know, or something along those lines.

2232
02:42:04,236 --> 02:42:06,177
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

2233
02:42:07,498 --> 02:42:13,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to be able to see something, and hopefully it will be less corporate controlled.

2234
02:42:13,741 --> 02:42:19,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know that's just looking at it through such, you know, dream pie-in-the-sky ideals, but...

2235
02:42:20,544 --> 02:42:27,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it sounds like a lot of the crap that happened on both G4 and Tech TV were just bad executive decisions.

2236
02:42:28,049 --> 02:42:35,154
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and I'm going to point this out, Leo Laporte tweeted this week, Attack of the Show and X-Play on G4 lasted eight years.

2237
02:42:35,214 --> 02:42:37,116
[SPEAKER_07]: That was longer than any show on Tech TV.

2238
02:42:38,977 --> 02:42:39,437
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

2239
02:42:40,118 --> 02:42:44,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Tech TV started in, I think, 99, and they were off the air in 2004.

2240
02:42:46,604 --> 02:42:47,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point.

2241
02:42:47,926 --> 02:42:51,750
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Bobby, before we let you go to take more calls, do you have anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2242
02:42:53,071 --> 02:42:54,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing a lot of interviews lately.

2243
02:42:54,673 --> 02:42:55,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you have.

2244
02:42:55,154 --> 02:42:55,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've been pretty good.

2245
02:42:56,215 --> 02:42:56,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you have.

2246
02:42:58,475 --> 02:43:00,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got a big interview show next week.

2247
02:43:00,537 --> 02:43:03,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not live, but I've got some big interviews.

2248
02:43:03,779 --> 02:43:06,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Hotline Miami, which is a new indie game that everybody's loving right now.

2249
02:43:08,103 --> 02:43:11,465
[SPEAKER_07]: And then MechWarrior Online and Fallen Enchantress.

2250
02:43:11,645 --> 02:43:13,006
[SPEAKER_07]: All those interviews next week.

2251
02:43:13,086 --> 02:43:18,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I interviewed a local studio about their first-person Magic game this week, earlier tonight.

2252
02:43:19,551 --> 02:43:22,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They're Xavier, and actually a lot of their developers were in chat.

2253
02:43:23,263 --> 02:43:23,523
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff.

2254
02:43:23,563 --> 02:43:30,310
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've already gotten an email from them thanking me for it and telling me that it sounds like one of the quotes I said may be on the back of the box in two years.

2255
02:43:30,551 --> 02:43:30,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

2256
02:43:31,251 --> 02:43:31,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Which would be awesome.

2257
02:43:32,172 --> 02:43:32,853
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

2258
02:43:33,334 --> 02:43:37,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, I wasn't the one that initially said the quote Dungeon Buster did, so I don't know how this works.

2259
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:41,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But they specific because it's a first-person magic game and...

2260
02:43:42,563 --> 02:43:50,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Dungeon Buster in chat was like, so it's kind of like Skyrim's magic system done right, and I repeated that, and that's what they quoted in the interview that they really appreciated hearing.

2261
02:43:52,189 --> 02:43:52,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2262
02:43:52,929 --> 02:43:53,990
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we'll see what happens.

2263
02:43:55,150 --> 02:44:02,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, if you're not already tuning in an hour early at vognetwork.com before OLR, you're missing out on a great, Bobby's having a great year.

2264
02:44:02,715 --> 02:44:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not that like the other seven sucked, but you're having a great year.

2265
02:44:06,517 --> 02:44:07,638
[SPEAKER_07]: But I still got snubbed.

2266
02:44:10,451 --> 02:44:12,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go there.

2267
02:44:12,413 --> 02:44:14,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you look at the list of who got nominated?

2268
02:44:14,236 --> 02:44:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of corp stuff.

2269
02:44:16,599 --> 02:44:22,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the corporate stuff gets nominated because people want to make a complete ballot and they don't know who else to nominate.

2270
02:44:24,429 --> 02:44:44,071
[SPEAKER_05]: but uh yep there you go uh Bobby you you definitely earned a place in our hearts oh thank you all right all right well Bobby I'm gonna let you go to get some more calls okay okay all right have a good one buddy you too bye that was fun reminiscing with Bobby we have another call coming right in though so let's get to the phones hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's this

2271
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:54,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh, I thought I heard wind in the background there.

2272
02:44:54,823 --> 02:44:56,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the storm rolling in?

2273
02:44:56,503 --> 02:44:58,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you getting blown by Sandy right now?

2274
02:44:58,404 --> 02:45:00,224
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

2275
02:45:00,244 --> 02:45:00,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to rain.

2276
02:45:10,822 --> 02:45:12,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, yes.

2277
02:45:12,484 --> 02:45:16,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Travis and Jessica.

2278
02:45:16,928 --> 02:45:21,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Last August, when Irene, Rita, I was going to stand up in here.

2279
02:45:22,553 --> 02:45:23,013
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

2280
02:45:24,274 --> 02:45:25,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's windy as hell.

2281
02:45:26,076 --> 02:45:27,297
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit of rain.

2282
02:45:28,418 --> 02:45:33,543
[SPEAKER_08]: The shoreline of Jersey has been more or less flooded out, but this Jersey, no one cares.

2283
02:45:34,502 --> 02:45:36,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the important things in life.

2284
02:45:36,164 --> 02:45:39,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about the hurricane though.

2285
02:45:39,427 --> 02:45:41,109
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you really want to talk about?

2286
02:46:01,232 --> 02:46:05,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there was something else that we had did as part of my podcast.

2287
02:46:05,934 --> 02:46:12,217
[SPEAKER_08]: On Friday, we went to an event in Lower Manhattan called Girl Gamers Meetup New York City.

2288
02:46:13,618 --> 02:46:14,579
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're not a girl.

2289
02:46:16,339 --> 02:46:18,280
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but some of my staffers are.

2290
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:19,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that works.

2291
02:46:19,341 --> 02:46:20,862
[SPEAKER_05]: He's meeting up with a lot of the girls.

2292
02:46:20,882 --> 02:46:21,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

2293
02:46:21,702 --> 02:46:23,363
[SPEAKER_05]: You just went to go get some phone numbers.

2294
02:46:23,443 --> 02:46:24,003
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm kidding.

2295
02:46:24,023 --> 02:46:24,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

2296
02:46:24,703 --> 02:46:25,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds fun.

2297
02:46:26,559 --> 02:46:28,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we'll save that for another time.

2298
02:46:31,082 --> 02:46:31,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2299
02:46:32,943 --> 02:46:33,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Why, thank you.

2300
02:46:34,383 --> 02:46:43,968
[SPEAKER_08]: But pretty much the point of the meetup was to get more girls involved into playing video games to prove that it's not just boys and men that are playing.

2301
02:46:44,009 --> 02:46:48,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Girls and women play video games, and they can kick as much ass as their counterparts.

2302
02:46:48,871 --> 02:46:49,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

2303
02:46:49,612 --> 02:46:50,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, DarkSakura?

2304
02:46:51,348 --> 02:46:51,628
Right.

2305
02:46:52,528 --> 02:46:54,349
[SPEAKER_05]: She said right, but you can't hear her anymore.

2306
02:46:54,829 --> 02:46:57,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, everything's just exploding because the Giants apparently won.

2307
02:46:58,630 --> 02:47:00,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is that their fourth game?

2308
02:47:00,391 --> 02:47:00,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2309
02:47:01,091 --> 02:47:01,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, boy.

2310
02:47:02,152 --> 02:47:03,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, then.

2311
02:47:03,952 --> 02:47:06,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad I didn't go to San Francisco this weekend.

2312
02:47:06,293 --> 02:47:09,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so glad because, oh.

2313
02:47:09,614 --> 02:47:19,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, given that I am a born and bred New Yorker, trust me, we feel the pain of not being there, and whereas there are the Mets fans that are like, well, this is really going to happen.

2314
02:47:42,074 --> 02:47:44,555
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

2315
02:47:44,635 --> 02:47:55,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what we did was we got a chance to interview Jen Vargas, the founder and creator of Girl Game Revolt.

2316
02:47:55,421 --> 02:48:05,167
[SPEAKER_08]: The point of our creating this is to prove that girls are just as good as gamers as guys, and to break the stereotype and prove that there is a difference between

2317
02:48:05,632 --> 02:48:07,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl Gamers, and Gamer Girls.

2318
02:48:07,412 --> 02:48:13,694
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the type of girls who sit there and they kind of look sexy with a controller and, you know, they don't like that.

2319
02:48:17,055 --> 02:48:17,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you still there?

2320
02:48:19,215 --> 02:48:19,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still here.

2321
02:48:19,895 --> 02:48:21,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me good, sir?

2322
02:48:21,196 --> 02:48:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can.

2323
02:48:21,596 --> 02:48:22,616
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that last part you said?

2324
02:48:24,116 --> 02:48:30,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I said the last part was about how to try to break the stereotypes and prove there is a difference between girl gamers and gamer girls.

2325
02:48:32,172 --> 02:48:33,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, okay, okay.

2326
02:48:33,572 --> 02:48:37,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So Olivia Munn is not necessarily a representation of gamer girls everywhere.

2327
02:48:37,593 --> 02:48:38,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I get what you mean.

2328
02:48:38,474 --> 02:48:39,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

2329
02:48:39,214 --> 02:48:39,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

2330
02:48:40,014 --> 02:48:53,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had some gamer girls there in costume talking about their YouTube channels and how they give tutorials on how to play various games, how to get through certain action games, and they had a theme.

2331
02:48:53,697 --> 02:49:00,279
[SPEAKER_08]: They were playing, we had Gears of War 3 with zombie mods, Left 4 Dead 2, Gauntlet, and Friday the 13th.

2332
02:49:03,655 --> 02:49:05,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Friday the 13th, like the 8-bit NES game?

2333
02:49:07,156 --> 02:49:07,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2334
02:49:07,717 --> 02:49:08,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was.

2335
02:49:08,677 --> 02:49:09,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.

2336
02:49:09,337 --> 02:49:10,798
[SPEAKER_05]: So where can we hear these interviews?

2337
02:49:12,498 --> 02:49:18,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we are holding on to them because NRA Jam Session is so ever grateful to Orange Knowledge Radio.

2338
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,781
[SPEAKER_08]: This interview that we did is exclusive to OLR.

2339
02:49:23,034 --> 02:49:23,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, awesome.

2340
02:49:23,574 --> 02:49:24,975
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play that next week.

2341
02:49:25,355 --> 02:49:30,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only will we have Eddie from A Money Style with us, but we're going to play that interview as well on the show.

2342
02:49:30,937 --> 02:49:32,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for doing that for us.

2343
02:49:33,618 --> 02:49:34,258
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

2344
02:49:34,278 --> 02:49:37,379
[SPEAKER_08]: When this popped up, the first person I thought of was my darling group, John.

2345
02:49:39,056 --> 02:49:39,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, barf.

2346
02:49:40,457 --> 02:49:41,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, shut up.

2347
02:49:42,198 --> 02:49:43,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought you vanilla tootsie rolls.

2348
02:49:43,619 --> 02:49:44,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You did.

2349
02:49:44,079 --> 02:49:44,339
[SPEAKER_05]: You did.

2350
02:49:44,359 --> 02:49:44,940
[SPEAKER_05]: They're delicious.

2351
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:46,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about barf.

2352
02:49:47,121 --> 02:49:47,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

2353
02:49:47,762 --> 02:50:02,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you are the man behind the anime show, and I know you have a whole staff behind you, but since you are the guy on the show here representing Anime Jam Session, I've got to ask you, I don't know, did you hear that email about the anime that's Nintendo and Sega and all that?

2354
02:50:02,452 --> 02:50:03,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear that email?

2355
02:50:04,645 --> 02:50:06,867
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not.

2356
02:50:07,107 --> 02:50:12,091
[SPEAKER_08]: We may have to investigate and talk about that on our show coming up on this Thursday.

2357
02:50:12,151 --> 02:50:12,871
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to.

2358
02:50:12,951 --> 02:50:14,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you more information.

2359
02:50:14,292 --> 02:50:20,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available on Crunchyroll, apparently, for free, and it's inspired by old Sega characters, apparently.

2360
02:50:20,957 --> 02:50:21,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember the name of it?

2361
02:50:22,238 --> 02:50:24,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Aoi no... Aoi Sekai no Chushinde.

2362
02:50:24,560 --> 02:50:24,940
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2363
02:50:24,980 --> 02:50:25,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, very good.

2364
02:50:25,801 --> 02:50:26,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Good memory.

2365
02:50:26,101 --> 02:50:28,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm actually looking at the page right now on Wikipedia.

2366
02:50:28,483 --> 02:50:29,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic memory.

2367
02:50:29,364 --> 02:50:29,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Because...

2368
02:50:30,605 --> 02:50:32,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I linked myself so I would find it.

2369
02:50:32,886 --> 02:50:34,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I just linked it on my Facebook, Ranjan.

2370
02:50:36,589 --> 02:50:36,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

2371
02:50:37,010 --> 02:50:39,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I will definitely check that when I go back inside.

2372
02:50:39,611 --> 02:50:39,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

2373
02:50:40,332 --> 02:50:41,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, Ranma, be safe.

2374
02:50:42,434 --> 02:50:43,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't float away.

2375
02:50:43,454 --> 02:50:44,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We will.

2376
02:50:44,435 --> 02:50:44,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2377
02:50:44,775 --> 02:50:45,436
[SPEAKER_08]: We will.

2378
02:50:45,476 --> 02:50:46,056
[SPEAKER_08]: We're good.

2379
02:50:46,076 --> 02:50:47,197
[SPEAKER_08]: We have enough battery backup.

2380
02:50:47,237 --> 02:50:48,438
[SPEAKER_08]: We have enough alcohol.

2381
02:50:48,678 --> 02:50:50,440
[SPEAKER_08]: We are good to go for the next 48 hours.

2382
02:50:50,620 --> 02:50:51,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

2383
02:50:51,541 --> 02:50:53,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill the bathtub with water.

2384
02:50:54,843 --> 02:50:55,343
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't.

2385
02:50:55,384 --> 02:50:57,305
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a stopper for the water.

2386
02:50:57,365 --> 02:50:58,426
[SPEAKER_08]: We are so blown up.

2387
02:50:59,472 --> 02:50:59,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

2388
02:51:00,333 --> 02:51:02,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Get every glass in the cupboard and fill it up.

2389
02:51:02,135 --> 02:51:02,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Condoms.

2390
02:51:04,357 --> 02:51:04,677
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2391
02:51:05,037 --> 02:51:06,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm ending this conversation.

2392
02:51:06,318 --> 02:51:07,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, Ranma.

2393
02:51:07,079 --> 02:51:07,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Be safe.

2394
02:51:08,641 --> 02:51:09,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2395
02:51:09,041 --> 02:51:10,462
[SPEAKER_08]: You safe driver is good, sir.

2396
02:51:10,763 --> 02:51:11,103
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2397
02:51:13,334 --> 02:51:14,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Ranma.

2398
02:51:14,615 --> 02:51:17,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you to everybody that called in tonight, both our callers.

2399
02:51:17,517 --> 02:51:20,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Since both those calls were a little long, we're going to wrap it up.

2400
02:51:20,759 --> 02:51:21,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2401
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:24,761
[SPEAKER_05]: But we still got to do some more last-minute stories on our Twitter topics.

2402
02:51:25,022 --> 02:51:26,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not even close to being done yet.

2403
02:51:26,963 --> 02:51:28,344
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to go for four hours tonight.

2404
02:51:28,804 --> 02:51:31,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, do you have other last-minute stories before I get to the tweets?

2405
02:51:31,786 --> 02:51:34,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the John Sisters Twisted Dreams is now available.

2406
02:51:35,348 --> 02:51:38,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get that on Steam as part of the Greenlight thing.

2407
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:40,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a token for it.

2408
02:51:40,531 --> 02:51:41,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to download it now.

2409
02:51:43,053 --> 02:51:50,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Zynga's bringing FarmVille, or I should say, you know, their online stuff, into online gambling.

2410
02:51:50,779 --> 02:52:04,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently they're planning on doing a slot-based simu- or slot simulator based on FarmVille, and, um, may expand into other online casino or bidding type things, so...

2411
02:52:05,231 --> 02:52:10,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have like Farmville Casino, like actual slot machines, like real slot machines.

2412
02:52:10,939 --> 02:52:14,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say they do have those, so I'm not surprised there.

2413
02:52:15,304 --> 02:52:19,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they lost $52.7 million in quarter three.

2414
02:52:20,130 --> 02:52:23,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably why they had to fire a lot of people or lay off.

2415
02:52:25,077 --> 02:52:28,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are just kind of over those type of games now.

2416
02:52:28,821 --> 02:52:31,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, then again, I get all these invites for FarmVille too, so maybe not.

2417
02:52:32,946 --> 02:52:34,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me do some quick Twitter topics here.

2418
02:52:35,769 --> 02:52:41,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked this tweet here, and I have to admit I'm not informed on the topic very much, but I'll try here.

2419
02:52:42,717 --> 02:52:49,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Nijela tweeted us, don't know if the Florence Gate saga has made it on your radar.

2420
02:52:49,643 --> 02:52:52,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Raises interesting questions about games journalism.

2421
02:52:52,886 --> 02:52:59,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Now apparently what happened, and he links us to something that's on Reddit, and here's the deal.

2422
02:52:59,271 --> 02:53:00,953
[SPEAKER_05]: According to what I see on Reddit here,

2423
02:53:01,633 --> 02:53:09,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert Florence just stepped down from Eurogamer because of his column yesterday, Blasting Games Journalists and Their Relationship to PR.

2424
02:53:10,456 --> 02:53:15,638
[SPEAKER_05]: And he links to a tweet from the author that says, Yesterday was my last piece for Eurogamer.

2425
02:53:15,738 --> 02:53:17,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is in amended form.

2426
02:53:17,458 --> 02:53:19,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I stand by every word of the original piece.

2427
02:53:20,459 --> 02:53:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember reading this original piece.

2428
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:25,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody linked it to me because it was all around Twitter.

2429
02:53:25,961 --> 02:53:28,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, why are all these people joking about Doritos and Mountain Dew?

2430
02:53:28,622 --> 02:53:29,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody fill me in.

2431
02:53:29,982 --> 02:53:32,204
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember reading this original piece.

2432
02:53:32,804 --> 02:53:42,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not sure I understand why this was so flippin' terrible, although I noticed there is an editor's note.

2433
02:53:43,231 --> 02:53:52,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Following receipt of a complaint from Lauren Wainwright, Eurogamer has removed part of this article, but without admission of any liability.

2434
02:53:52,978 --> 02:53:55,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Eurogamer apologizes for any distress caused to Ms.

2435
02:53:55,600 --> 02:53:57,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Wainwright by the references to her.

2436
02:53:57,561 --> 02:54:00,303
[SPEAKER_05]: This article otherwise remains as originally published.

2437
02:54:00,764 --> 02:54:06,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, because I don't have a photographic memory, I don't know what that means was cut from the article.

2438
02:54:06,628 --> 02:54:22,260
[SPEAKER_05]: My assumption, bolded, italicized, underlined, was that it probably had to do with a particular PR rep or PR firm that was kind of doing some things that might be considered questionable.

2439
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:24,362
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole thing's about basically...

2440
02:54:26,021 --> 02:54:28,983
[SPEAKER_05]: How tight of a hold does PR have on games journalism?

2441
02:54:29,003 --> 02:54:29,843
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you spell her last name?

2442
02:54:32,725 --> 02:54:33,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Right there.

2443
02:54:33,825 --> 02:54:34,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of a bitch.

2444
02:54:35,466 --> 02:54:37,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit the button on my iPad that takes me back to start.

2445
02:54:37,667 --> 02:54:38,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

2446
02:54:38,888 --> 02:54:39,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of a bitch.

2447
02:54:39,568 --> 02:54:40,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, there it is right there.

2448
02:54:40,429 --> 02:54:41,149
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the name for you.

2449
02:54:41,830 --> 02:54:42,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I zoom in on that?

2450
02:54:42,670 --> 02:54:44,251
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because it's an iPad specific site.

2451
02:54:46,676 --> 02:54:47,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2452
02:54:47,356 --> 02:54:52,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking for the... BlackWolf says he quoted the public Twitter of Lauren Weinreich.

2453
02:54:53,581 --> 02:54:58,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Her outlet threatened libel, which is nasty in UK libel laws.

2454
02:54:58,484 --> 02:55:12,052
[SPEAKER_05]: They quoted her public Twitter about how she was okay with promoting hashtags to win a PlayStation 3 and then talked about how she was promoting Tomb Raider and then uncovered that she actually works as a freelancer for Square Enix.

2455
02:55:12,413 --> 02:55:13,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I need to call back in?

2456
02:55:13,954 --> 02:55:14,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe...

2457
02:55:14,654 --> 02:55:27,107
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a better memory than I, sir, because I remember looking at the original article and I was like, yeah, I could have told you that for a long time now, basically, that PR has its grip firmly on hold of a lot of games journalism.

2458
02:55:27,648 --> 02:55:31,011
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I've always said indies are the best, because...

2459
02:55:31,952 --> 02:55:42,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though not everybody, you know, is, you know, some of these indie gamers are probably the first ones to do the, or indie folks are probably the first ones to do these hashtags to try and win a PlayStation 3.

2460
02:55:43,396 --> 02:55:46,137
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times that's where the most honesty is going to come from as well.

2461
02:55:46,857 --> 02:55:48,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thank you, Bobby, for setting us straight.

2462
02:55:51,092 --> 02:55:54,013
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of sucks that it cost this guy his job, though.

2463
02:55:54,634 --> 02:55:56,855
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a quote from Forbes, by the way.

2464
02:55:57,755 --> 02:55:58,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Go join Polygon.

2465
02:56:01,337 --> 02:56:02,297
[SPEAKER_05]: They sound like a group.

2466
02:56:02,517 --> 02:56:05,038
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like a Voltron of game people.

2467
02:56:05,118 --> 02:56:06,079
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you need to be, buddy.

2468
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:10,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently... Wow.

2469
02:56:11,281 --> 02:56:11,581
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2470
02:56:13,022 --> 02:56:22,051
[SPEAKER_02]: She has, okay, since then, Lauren Wainwright has had personal verbal attacks, sent to her Twitter, which she has now locked, her Steam account, and other networking sites.

2471
02:56:22,071 --> 02:56:24,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now that's crossing the line ridiculousness.

2472
02:56:24,894 --> 02:56:26,255
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is coming from other people.

2473
02:56:26,856 --> 02:56:30,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this was actually on Reddit, is where I'm finding this.

2474
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:32,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to read a little bit of it, if you don't mind.

2475
02:56:32,421 --> 02:56:33,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

2476
02:56:33,682 --> 02:56:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Florence wrote an article calling out unprofessional behavior in gaming journalism.

2477
02:56:37,125 --> 02:56:39,666
[SPEAKER_02]: He then steps down from his job at Eurogamer.

2478
02:56:39,986 --> 02:56:40,967
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so he quit.

2479
02:56:41,067 --> 02:56:42,388
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't fired.

2480
02:56:43,048 --> 02:56:51,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of this article, as he was told, he would be sued for libel against Lauren Wainwright since, in the uncensored version, he outed her for questionable behavior.

2481
02:56:51,534 --> 02:56:56,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, she's had personal attacks at her Twitter, her Steam account, other networking sites.

2482
02:56:56,898 --> 02:57:03,042
[SPEAKER_02]: The Forbes article states, it only takes a few bad apples to turn a conversation about free speech and journalism into one about misogyny.

2483
02:57:03,762 --> 02:57:06,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So apparently people have been taking this really seriously.

2484
02:57:09,367 --> 02:57:13,531
[SPEAKER_02]: He was calling out integrity and people were turning it around as an attack, so...

2485
02:57:14,464 --> 02:57:18,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf says, Ben Kuchera did a great article about this whole thing on Penny Arcade Report.

2486
02:57:19,147 --> 02:57:20,327
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't surprise me at all.

2487
02:57:20,387 --> 02:57:24,810
[SPEAKER_05]: He's pretty good about taking these situations and putting them into perspective.

2488
02:57:26,851 --> 02:57:33,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to admit, again, the core issue, we've all known about that for a very long time.

2489
02:57:33,274 --> 02:57:38,937
[SPEAKER_05]: But this whole fallout, and especially now that part where people were threatening her on Twitter and shit, that's...

2490
02:57:41,629 --> 02:57:43,410
[SPEAKER_05]: That's stupid and that's unfortunate.

2491
02:57:44,030 --> 02:57:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: What else can I say?

2492
02:57:44,550 --> 02:57:47,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to see if anybody's published the unedited.

2493
02:57:49,812 --> 02:57:50,072
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2494
02:57:50,352 --> 02:57:52,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyway, let me get some more of these tweets here.

2495
02:57:53,453 --> 02:57:59,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Sertour tweeted us and said, I love Bobby Blackwolf and OLR so much and VOG Network.

2496
02:58:00,155 --> 02:58:01,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we love you too.

2497
02:58:02,255 --> 02:58:03,536
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura sends kisses.

2498
02:58:04,899 --> 02:58:05,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Snotty ones.

2499
02:58:08,204 --> 02:58:08,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2500
02:58:09,206 --> 02:58:15,715
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt tweeted us and said, Hey folks, I just want to let you know you guys are keeping me company right now on my three-hour drive to Boston.

2501
02:58:15,896 --> 02:58:16,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2502
02:58:17,037 --> 02:58:17,578
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

2503
02:58:18,079 --> 02:58:18,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Three-hour drive?

2504
02:58:19,541 --> 02:58:20,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a long drive.

2505
02:58:24,085 --> 02:58:29,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw tweets us, the Mass Effect movie moves forward with a new screenwriter.

2506
02:58:30,033 --> 02:58:33,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I know y'all love your Mass Effect, especially if your name is Shane or DarkSakura.

2507
02:58:33,918 --> 02:58:38,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me read this link here that we got tweeted to from SlashFilm.

2508
02:58:39,685 --> 02:58:48,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, screenwriter Morgan Davis-Fole has been hired to make a new pass at the script for Mass Effect.

2509
02:58:49,468 --> 02:58:56,090
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the first big movement on the project since 2010 when Legendary Pictures purchased the right to the franchise.

2510
02:58:57,070 --> 02:59:00,091
[SPEAKER_05]: This writer, though, he has yet to have a script produced.

2511
02:59:00,991 --> 02:59:01,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2512
02:59:02,392 --> 02:59:09,779
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess he wrote Alien Sleeper Cell and worked on Rescue Me as well as some Happy Madison films.

2513
02:59:09,939 --> 02:59:10,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

2514
02:59:11,601 --> 02:59:12,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

2515
02:59:12,201 --> 02:59:13,603
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not sounding good so far.

2516
02:59:14,203 --> 02:59:23,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's a massive Mass Effect fan and producers liked his take after obviously deciding not to move forward with the original script by Mark Protosevich.

2517
02:59:24,993 --> 02:59:25,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

2518
02:59:26,375 --> 02:59:37,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well as long as it's more Rescue Me and less Happy Madison, I'll be alright, because he actually is a fan of the games, but on behalf of the entire fan community, do not fuck this up.

2519
02:59:37,526 --> 02:59:40,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not, not fuck this up.

2520
02:59:40,529 --> 02:59:42,892
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw gives us one more tweet here about

2521
02:59:44,548 --> 02:59:50,712
[SPEAKER_05]: EA taking a part in American Cancer Society's Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk.

2522
02:59:51,372 --> 02:59:53,934
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to hear about the good things EA did.

2523
02:59:54,414 --> 02:59:55,755
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about this.

2524
02:59:55,815 --> 02:59:57,797
[SPEAKER_05]: He links us to a story from Game Politics.

2525
02:59:58,217 --> 03:00:01,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Team EA took part in the American Cancer Society's

2526
03:00:01,599 --> 03:00:07,803
[SPEAKER_05]: making strides against Breast Cancer Walk in San Francisco to raise funds for the fight against breast cancer.

2527
03:00:08,383 --> 03:00:15,107
[SPEAKER_05]: EA Chief Operating Officer Peter Moore was on hand to kick off the event and walked with the employees.

2528
03:00:15,967 --> 03:00:16,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So very cool.

2529
03:00:17,328 --> 03:00:22,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Good on you, EA, for doing your public service for an important cause.

2530
03:00:23,692 --> 03:00:24,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2531
03:00:24,412 --> 03:00:26,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys very much for your tweets tonight.

2532
03:00:26,433 --> 03:00:28,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2533
03:00:29,295 --> 03:00:32,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, TigerClaw, I know there's one more tweet, but it's a two tweet maximum.

2534
03:00:34,083 --> 03:00:35,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, any other last minute stories you want to share tonight?

2535
03:00:36,907 --> 03:00:43,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, PopCap and EA are teaming up with the ADA to give you free Plants vs. Zombies for Halloween.

2536
03:00:44,406 --> 03:00:45,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an email on that.

2537
03:00:45,767 --> 03:00:48,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It's stopzombiemouth.com.

2538
03:00:49,211 --> 03:00:49,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of cool, though.

2539
03:00:50,031 --> 03:00:57,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're trying to be cheap about giving out candy and stuff like that, you could be one of those people that gives out something else.

2540
03:00:57,698 --> 03:01:00,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they have coupons that you can print off.

2541
03:01:00,541 --> 03:01:09,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, they have a code on there that can be used between October 30th and November 10th to redeem a free copy of the PC version of Plants vs. Zombies for PC or Mac.

2542
03:01:10,850 --> 03:01:34,015
[SPEAKER_03]: and um it's all the same code so you can print off sheets of those cut them up and give those out instead of candy if you want to or with candy or with candy um and so you can do that if you don't feel like going to and basically just go back to the stopzombiemouth.com website and then use the code p-hater p-e-a-h-a-t-r

2543
03:01:36,445 --> 03:01:36,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Peahatter.

2544
03:01:37,548 --> 03:01:38,511
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the plants is a peahat.

2545
03:01:43,244 --> 03:01:44,245
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be either way.

2546
03:01:44,425 --> 03:01:47,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a pee-hater because they don't like getting hit in the face with pee.

2547
03:01:47,928 --> 03:01:48,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

2548
03:01:49,429 --> 03:01:51,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, you know, urine.

2549
03:01:52,651 --> 03:01:53,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that.

2550
03:01:53,532 --> 03:01:59,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, also this I was kind of talking about before I actually got to read the whole thing now.

2551
03:02:00,197 --> 03:02:06,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's going to be some updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

2552
03:02:07,082 --> 03:02:12,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember before how it was okay to jailbreak your iPods and iPhones and stuff like that?

2553
03:02:13,767 --> 03:02:14,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to be the case anymore.

2554
03:02:15,088 --> 03:02:23,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it's only legal to jailbreak phones or say unlocked prior to January 2013.

2555
03:02:25,777 --> 03:02:28,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, after that, it is no longer legal to do that.

2556
03:02:28,959 --> 03:02:35,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it's no longer legal to jailbreak tablet devices or root tablet devices.

2557
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:38,020
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of unfortunate.

2558
03:02:38,521 --> 03:02:40,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a big step backwards to the whole thing.

2559
03:02:46,644 --> 03:02:51,626
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more websites running that whole Disney toy box thing, but we already know what that is, right?

2560
03:02:52,066 --> 03:02:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, Disney Infinity has a great logo.

2561
03:02:54,867 --> 03:02:55,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It does have a nice logo.

2562
03:02:57,731 --> 03:03:03,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting that they have two different components of the game.

2563
03:03:05,398 --> 03:03:07,821
[SPEAKER_03]: One of which would be, let's see here.

2564
03:03:09,465 --> 03:03:11,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Pages not turning correctly.

2565
03:03:12,587 --> 03:03:15,189
[SPEAKER_03]: One of which was dubbed the Toy Box.

2566
03:03:15,969 --> 03:03:20,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And one, of course, is the actual characters, the play sets.

2567
03:03:20,832 --> 03:03:22,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're the play sets in the Toy Box.

2568
03:03:23,153 --> 03:03:32,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, tying in with Monsters U, Cars, The Lone Ranger, The Incredibles, Toy Story, and Pirates of the Caribbean.

2569
03:03:33,416 --> 03:03:37,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we talked about last week... It's two Johnny Depp movies, if I'm not mistaken.

2570
03:03:37,499 --> 03:03:39,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is, because he's in a lot of stuff.

2571
03:03:40,081 --> 03:03:41,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks interesting.

2572
03:03:41,702 --> 03:03:42,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a picture here.

2573
03:03:43,264 --> 03:03:45,305
[SPEAKER_03]: The reader looks really different.

2574
03:03:45,505 --> 03:03:48,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like, you know, say...

2575
03:03:49,148 --> 03:04:05,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylanders, but they've got these characters and these coins and then looks like boss characters, almost like they have that mech thing from The Incredibles, so you can team up with Buzz Lightyear and Mr. Incredible and stuff.

2576
03:04:05,621 --> 03:04:05,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, neat.

2577
03:04:07,583 --> 03:04:07,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2578
03:04:08,323 --> 03:04:09,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

2579
03:04:09,164 --> 03:04:10,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the game's good.

2580
03:04:10,585 --> 03:04:17,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it probably will be, I mean, considering how well Skylanders does, and Skylanders, to be honest, is a very new property versus...

2581
03:04:18,752 --> 03:04:21,234
[SPEAKER_03]: and Disney characters, which everybody fucking knows.

2582
03:04:23,576 --> 03:04:27,821
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, before we wrap up the show tonight, I bet you thought I forgot, but I didn't.

2583
03:04:29,554 --> 03:04:32,016
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to reveal the winners of tonight's list list.

2584
03:04:32,316 --> 03:04:36,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It just took me forever to tabulate the votes because there was a lot of participation tonight and I've been talking a lot.

2585
03:04:37,381 --> 03:04:40,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's reveal tonight's winners of the list list.

2586
03:04:40,864 --> 03:04:49,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Here it is, the definitive list, the top three things scientifically proven that you guys want on G4 to get you to watch it again.

2587
03:04:49,851 --> 03:04:51,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is a tie.

2588
03:04:52,233 --> 03:04:53,454
[SPEAKER_05]: The screensavers.

2589
03:04:54,742 --> 03:04:58,205
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show.

2590
03:04:59,506 --> 03:05:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: The number three answer.

2591
03:05:00,867 --> 03:05:04,890
[SPEAKER_05]: The number two thing that would most get you to watch G4 again.

2592
03:05:05,951 --> 03:05:08,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Starcade 2 Electric Boogaloo.

2593
03:05:10,834 --> 03:05:20,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, the number one, the numero uno thing, the thing that G4 ought to book right now to get everybody to watch it again.

2594
03:05:21,624 --> 03:05:23,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's Cosplay Challenge!

2595
03:05:24,728 --> 03:05:25,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

2596
03:05:25,269 --> 03:05:26,530
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I'll be getting paid!

2597
03:05:30,755 --> 03:05:34,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's Cosplay Challenge is the thing you most want on G4 TV.

2598
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:35,701
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

2599
03:05:36,202 --> 03:05:38,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Signed, sealed, delivered, done.

2600
03:05:39,674 --> 03:05:43,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well that's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2608
03:06:32,218 --> 03:06:34,020
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one errand we still have to run this weekend.

[SPEAKER_05]: My head hurts.

03:06:48,209 --> 03:06:50,050
[SPEAKER_05]: We may green light that for VOG.

2616
03:06:50,130 --> 03:06:51,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's costume is not going to happen.

2617
03:06:54,053 --> 03:06:54,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to disappoint you.

2618
03:06:56,034 --> 03:06:56,295
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2619
03:06:56,315 --> 03:06:58,736
[SPEAKER_03]: The picture is closest you're going to get to the dream.

2620
03:06:58,756 --> 03:06:59,537
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

2621
03:06:59,717 --> 03:07:01,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Because really, what's going to happen?

2622
03:07:01,098 --> 03:07:03,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I never said you had to dress up as Tingle.

2623
03:07:03,599 --> 03:07:05,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they seem to think that.

2624
03:07:07,862 --> 03:07:08,202
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2625
03:07:08,723 --> 03:07:09,083
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

2626
03:07:09,103 --> 03:07:10,764
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for another week at Orange Lounge Radio.
