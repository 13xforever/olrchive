1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Forge, Lounge, Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, October 28th, 2012. Has the Playstation 3 been hacked again?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Zynga makes some big layoffs. And could not all Wii U features make the system launch?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this October the 28th of 2012, episode number 479 of our show.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all that good stuff with my co-host.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. How are you doing?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're like sick and stuff, huh?

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have a sinus infection.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You better not be contagious.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sinus infections aren't contagious.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Last time you had a sinus infection I got the swine flu.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You know what, Rob? Okay.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm never going to let you live that down.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, that's from not eating enough pork.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, hi Tech Master, Loki. How are you?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You mentioned pork, sorry.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright, what were you going to say, DarkSakura?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I was going to say I thought I had a sinus infection and then I ended up getting really sick.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I ended up not having a very bad version of it and you ended up being, what, bedridden or something?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, sorry.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't help it if my immune system is wonderful, Rob, and that everything is just weak sauce when it hits me.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Alright, well if you want to join-

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I am stronger than the swine flu.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you want to join us and talk about sickness or games would be preferred, but you never know.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Live.vognetwork.com is where you can chat along with us and you can also check in if you are listening live.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, those are on now.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Man, if it's not up by like the first second the intro music hits, I start getting private messages.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Check-ins are down, check-ins are down, check-ins are down.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But check-ins are now on for Orange Lounge Radio.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A little bit late. Thanks, Bobby.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We are, of course, live after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf at the Voice of Geeks Network.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
vognetwork.com.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Lots of great shows that play on VOG throughout the week, including my other show that's all about the World of Warcraft.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The best little Horde house in Azeroth, or Horde house for short.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And the reason why I bring that up, crossover week this week with Girls Gone Wow, our friends over there in the UK.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And we were on their show today and they're going to come on Horde house later this week.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So it's crossover week. Why? Because sweeps month is coming up.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sweeps month. So that's when we got to pull out all the stunts.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Crossover shows, super special episodes, and at the end of the month somebody will die.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We just haven't figured out who yet. Anyhow.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Also I feel kind of bad.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For crocheting when I'm sick.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because I feel like whoever is going to get the scarf is going to get diseases like I'm a European settler.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You should feel bad for crocheting when we have so many things in the gaming world to talk about this week.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can talk and crochet at the same time, Rob.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Actually it was kind of a slower news week. We'll get into that later.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But let me put it this way. Tonight we have Listless making a comeback tonight.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It has been forever since we played an OLR game. I was just realizing that earlier.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So we are bringing back Listless tonight.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well you don't even know the topic yet.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't care. All of my answers are pie. Because of Alan.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was going to say you got to try Alan's award winning pumpkin. It's not pumpkin pie. It's like pumpkin mousse dessert thing.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Chocolate chips and pumpkin. Chocolate and pumpkin.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He won first place at his work in the big bake off. And it's a big deal.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And he beat the reigning champion and it's not pretty.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I was fearing for his life actually.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I had to escort him to the parking lot to make sure he wouldn't get jumped.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Were you afraid of severe judgement?

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But everything was okay. So there you go.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Again, live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And Dark Tetsuya pointing out there goes Loki talking out of turn again.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
As he tends to do at the top of the show.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Technically not out of turn. She talked. I talked. I just talked sooner than you were expecting me.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not out of turn though.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And right now? Don't give a shit.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Surprise Loki. Surprise.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright, I don't have a lot of stuff to talk about before we get into our gaming weeks and the news tonight.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Did we actually give Loki a full introduction?

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, you mentioned it.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Like, tech glasses.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Who is this guy? Who is this person that's talking?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm gonna flip the table in a second.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I have missed the 478 prior episodes of Orange Launch Radio.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Who is this guy? Seriously.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm taking back my Tootsie Rolls.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I can't figure it out based on the intro and the two people that have been introduced.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I just wish I could deduce who this was.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let me go back. Let me go back for a minute here.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let me listen to Midihead again here.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Bob. You know what? Shut. Stop it. I'm on drugs.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The show is called Orange Launch Radio.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm on drugs.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There he is.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You hush. You know what I was talking about. I will poke you in the eye with this needle.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Alright, for real though. I have a serious kickoff topic tonight. For real.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like, okay, probably the most number, like the highest concentration of listeners for Orange Launch Radio is here in Northern California.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because that's where we are. That's where a lot of the video games industry is.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So the highest concentration of Orange Launch Radio is in Northern California.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The second highest concentration of OLR listeners, I'm pretty sure, is New York City.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So obviously New York's going through a little bit right now with this whole, I don't know, some woman named Sandy is coming to blow everybody.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Cause she's, you're the one that she wants.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sound like a porno.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ooh, hoo, hoo.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In all seriousness, if you are in the path of that hurricane, I hope you've taken all those precautions to be safe.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If they've told you to evacuate, please turn off OLR.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We will be there on the podcast feed later.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And evacuate if that's what they've told you to do.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But if you have holed yourself up in the house with the walls all boarded up and you've got your liquor ready to go.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Like if DJ Rama's picture earlier was any indication.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you see the picture that Rama posted earlier of all his boos?

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He had all his boos. He's like, I'm ready for the hurricane.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know what, Rob? Think about New York City and think about trying to evacuate.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Not happening.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I know, right? Well, they closed the subway. They closed the schools.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
By the time a hurricane hits up there, you know what it's gonna be?

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A sneeze.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I hope you're right.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, cause you know last night-

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I lose momentum inland.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Last night they were talking about this tsunami's gonna hit Hawaii and the tsunami's coming in and they had to evacuate the shores.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then it ended up not really being a big deal.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Like you definitely didn't want to be in the water. It's not a time to surf. Like you could have really hurt yourself.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm more worried about Florida.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, well this thing isn't in the path of Florida, I don't think. Is it?

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Is it that big of a hurricane?

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, even a small hurricane is fairly big, Rob.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well, no matter what. Look, we live in California. This isn't something we really have to deal with here. We have the earthquake thing instead.

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But if you're in the path of this thing, I hope you're safe. That's what I really wanted to say.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Fill your bathtub full of water. Buy bleach. Get all the bread in the grocery store. And cans.

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Ignorant California question. Ignorant California question.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What? What? What? What?

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why do you fill your bathtub with water?

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, in case the water pipes break, or you get sewage backed up into the water, you have a tub, which is like what I think, I want to say seven gallons of fresh water.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Oh, so it's like your reserve water.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And you put like two drops of bleach in it to purify it.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, okay.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So that way, even if the water lines are down, you have drinking water.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, that makes sense. So you just need to have plenty of drinking water.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, and you know why you tape the windows, right?

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Uh, that has to do with the pressure, right? So you don't get blow.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You don't get to if they actually break the table, hold it, and keep it from shattering.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, yeah, that's what I figured. I knew it was something long.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It also stops the fog from coming in that turns people inside out.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Shut up.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's a Simpsons reference.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Alright, anyhow, um, look, uh, I wanted to bring up this story because I had no idea that somebody was already waiting in line at Nintendo World for a Wii U.

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Isaiah Triforce Johnson, I guess he changed his name to have Triforce in it.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He is a die-hard Nintendo fan to say the least.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I believe this is him last time with Reggie getting his Wii, so this guy is no stranger to camping out overnight.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why does Reggie always look like a mannequin?

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Because he's pretty.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Look at his eyes.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Because his body was ready for cybernetic enhancement.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He looks like he's a wax man.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He's perfectly groomed. He's a well-groomed man. There's nothing wrong with that.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's gotta be a public figure for Nintendo. He can't look crazy.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Like if Doc Brown came up and like,

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hi, I'm Wii U!

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
His skin looks waxy.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Does he wax his face?

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That might sell me a Wii U.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, anyway, look, the real story.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mr. Triforce Johnson had to give up his spot in line because they basically said that the security at Rockefeller Center said you need to vacate by 6 p.m.

160
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So he had to actually leave.

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
However, it has been promised that he may return to his place after Nintendo World reopens when the hurricane has passed.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So the hurricane has already caused at least one major disruption.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, well, then we should just call this hurricane, Hurricane Common Sense.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Because who the fuck lines up for a Wii U a month before it comes out?

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If this thing is disastrous, you are going to feel bad about making jokes about it.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, I'm not going to feel bad. I feel no remorse.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No pity, and he will not stop until you are dead.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wait, that was Terminator, sorry.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I can understand lining up a couple days ahead of time or the night of, but a month ahead of time?

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He wanted to be the first.

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
May as well just stay in line for the next Nintendo system.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Alright, let's see, questions from our chat room.

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Very important questions from chat at live.vognetwork.com.

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Taiki asks, who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B? I think that's a Loki question.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Loki, who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B?

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, Cliffy does have the youth going for him when he is a lot younger.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Reggie's kind of trollish, so it's hard to say.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But Reggie is probably much nicer in person, whereas Cliffy kind of comes off as a douche.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The thing about Cliffy, and I know this is exactly what you wanted to hear on a video game podcast this week.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The thing about Cliffy is he kind of has that male porn star hair going for him that's not doing him any favors.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Because straight men in porn, not always that exciting to look at.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And he's kind of got that hair going for it.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's like some minus points.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But you're right, he does have that youth factor. He doesn't look waxy like Reggie.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Male porn stars always make me think of diseases.

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Walking herpes.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
WhatupG in chat says Nintendo should just send him a Wii U.

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you think Mr. Triforce Johnson has earned the damn Wii U at this point?

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Nintendo wants money.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat says Nintendo did say he will still be the first in line.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Which is good PR for Nintendo.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There you go.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I would have laughed if someone snuck in front of him before.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What, I was waiting here before you. You left.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Rama, run out there quick.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Alright, there you go.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Even though we're having fun with the subject and the story and everything.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
First off, props to that guy for being so damn dedicated. You know what, props to you sir.

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And second off, for real, we hope everybody is safe in this hurricane. Please be safe.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't be stupid.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No props to him for standing out there a month in advance.

202
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He's actually on the payroll for Nintendo a little bit as well.

203
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's part of the problem.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
He's done some events and stuff for Nintendo and actually covered stuff as a liaison for Nintendo.

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm sorry, no. No props for this dude standing out a month in advance.

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, cool. You're a dedicated Nintendo fan.

207
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, you couldn't be up Reggie's ass a little bit more than you are.

208
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So, I mean, cool that you're really excited.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If Reggie's ass is as waxy as the rest of him, then it should be as smooth as...

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is starting to go to a place I'm not okay with.

211
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm just not...

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Just throwing it out there.

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm just...

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's just like those people that stand...

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know, I understand it's like, oh hey, it's fandom and stuff like that.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There's got to be a line to draw here, okay?

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It'd be like me, well, I'm going to stand out in front of this building for a year

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because I'm waiting for the next Xbox 360 or something.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
People are going to be like, no, you're an idiot.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You should go stand in line for Breaking Dawn Part 2.

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No, I'm not.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You know someone is somewhere.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, no one is.

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because you know why?

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Because they don't have to do that anymore.

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They have Fandango and places you can buy tickets online.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So that, you know, all those people are like, oh hey, I waited here for a couple days to get my tickets to Batman.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're like, fuck you, I just spent two seconds and went online and got tickets for Batman.

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, who's the idiot now?

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There are some movies where they do the midnight openings where they don't put them up on Fandango.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Alright, let's...

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I, however, saw Frankenweenie opening night at Disneyland.

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The end.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And trust me...

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, can I touch you?

237
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
No.

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I might catch gay.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Speaking of movies, speaking of movies, and I know we already had movies as a kickoff topic a couple weeks ago.

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Are we going to see The Gift?

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But I quickly want to say Silent Hill 3D Revelation. I did not see it yet. None of us did.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I hear it is so bad. Like it's showgirls bad. Without the tits. Like it is really bad.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And that makes me want to see it more.

244
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Rob, let's do this.

245
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What?

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Next week.

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We need to see it at some point.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Just, you know.

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Tomorrow night.

250
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We'll have your people call my people and find a time.

251
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Tomorrow night.

252
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That actually probably will work.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Okay.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I don't know. I've got to make sure the other half won't be mad I see it without them.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Well, I'll be going SNIFF SNORT.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because I'll be sick.

257
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And then, of course, this coming week, Wreck-It Ralph.

258
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Which I know we've all been excited about.

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
One other thing I heard about that movie is that the flashlights, the shine from the flashlights are in 3D.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh boy.

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I know, right?

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Our buddy Mel, you know, Mel B, the classic DDR freestyler.

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He, I don't know, he got some type of hookup or passes, won them, I don't know.

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He got to already see Wreck-It Ralph.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And he gave it his stamp of approval.

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And that's pretty important.

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So we know that movie isn't going to completely suck.

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So I'm excited about that.

269
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The City Vampire, pointing out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

270
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Silent Hill has a less than 10% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's when you know it's like really bad.

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's not like 30% bad, it's less than 10% bad.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I actually liked the first one.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I did too.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I saw it four times in the theater, I own two copies of it.

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Shit.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I have to see this.

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Alright.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Raginator in chat says, showgirls should be remade in 3D.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Nothing beats 3D boobs, right?

281
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That may be true, but honestly, when it comes to showgirls, nothing beats going to the Castro theater

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and watching a bunch of drag queens reenact the scene where she comes out of the volcano.

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm so mad I missed it this year.

284
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's like your reason to live right there.

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And if you want a close second into a possible showgirls in 3D,

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you can just watch like, what is it, Piranha 3D.

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's true.

288
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's true.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm actually super upset that I missed showgirls this year.

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's always next year.

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Next year we need a huge group.

292
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

293
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Back to video games and what we have been playing this week.

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

295
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Mass Effect, the first one, because my Mass Effect 3 still doesn't work.

296
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I mean, I can kind of get it to run and I've gotten into multiplayer now,

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but it's like, it's just awful and they've escalated me again.

298
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This will come up in the FUs.

299
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And I've hardly played any WoW, actually.

300
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You had like hella customer service EA stuff this week, didn't you?

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I was on with two different customer service reps on their live chat for seven hours.

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And one of the guys was super cool.

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The other guy was, okay, okay, okay.

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I have no problem with people from other countries.

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I have a problem with them when they're outsourcing our jobs.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, when EA is sending a job and I know India's always picked on,

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
but it definitely was an Indian name.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And I was like, dude, no offense to you.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I want to speak to somebody in U.S. customer service who actually will listen to what I'm saying

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and not just make assumptions about what I'm saying.

311
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Because if you go back and read the log, you'll understand this has nothing to do with my DLC.

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It has to do with the damn patch.

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The thing about outsourced customer service in general, and it doesn't matter what country it's from,

314
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
even within the U.S. outsourcing sometimes, is that they usually are stuck to a script.

315
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And if your inquiry or your question deviates from that script

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and the things that they are very literally trained to handle, that's when you start to run into issues.

317
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And unfortunately, what upper management fails to see a lot of the time is that most inquiries go off script.

318
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I worked in customer service for how long?

319
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The reason why I was good is because I stopped following my script because I knew what I was talking about.

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And this has just gone on way too long.

321
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And I finally, you know, they said, oh, we'll do the email service.

322
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And they had me do a trace, which that I thought was a good idea to see if there was a connection problem on my end.

323
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I can tell you right when the problem started, it started with the last patch.

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The patch did something because before that I had no problem.

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So just so tired of it.

326
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And and also just with I started getting I started with the sinus infection yesterday.

327
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It was while I was out running errands. It's just I haven't really felt like playing much in the way of games.

328
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And then when I got home, I was like, I want to play Mass Effect because I'm playing back through and doing all the stuff that

329
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
because the first time I just blew through the game.

330
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And this time I'm I made Caden jealous, which was awesome.

331
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And then I picked Liara over him. So he ran out in a snit.

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And then I'm also though now I feel really dirty because, like, it's the equivalent of a 32 year old woman dating an 18 year old.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Because Liara is basically she's the equivalent mentally of an 18 year old.

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's dating a child. It does not work. It feels very wrong.

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So, you know, these are all fake people, right?

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I know Liara is blue. I know.

337
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But OK, it's the point, though, of believability.

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And what one because I mean, yeah, some people are really into dating children, I guess.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You know, I maybe it's just I'm spoiled by Garris.

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't know. Acidic vampire in our chat room asks, have other people had the same problem with the patch?

341
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yes, I'm not the only one.

342
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So it's been going on. And actually, people are now referencing my thing on the EA answer thing on BioWare's forums.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Several people have reposted it. A bunch of us have actually gone on to the Mass Effect Facebook page and linked it, which they've deleted.

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Interesting. All right. Loki, let's move on to you. How was your gaming week?

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I played Minecraft. It's pretty much it.

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I mean, I was working on some stuff for that just on the roller coaster that I had there.

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We added some more pixel art stuff in there, have a portion where it jumps into the mouth of a piranha plant, which is pretty sweet.

348
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And then was a hit son was making.

349
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He made a knight's was I remember the main character knight says, I guess knights would be knights.

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes, made knights flying in the air. So that's kind of cool.

351
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And we got the new patch this week.

352
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, you know, updated the server and been playing around command blocks, made some teleportation stations so we can, you know, hop to different parts of the map pretty quick.

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And it's about it. Wish more people are on there because it's usually just me.

354
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And then occasionally I'll see people pop in. But it's been pretty slow.

355
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I know there's a lot of games out right now, so not surprising.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I was actually in the play some of those games, but I didn't know which one I wanted to play.

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Got into that weird like gamer ADD stuff where I was like, ah, I can play Dishonored and start that game.

358
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But I want to start another game because I'm already in the middle of Borderlands two.

359
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I don't know. It's just it's already beaten that game three times.

360
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sure he has. Oh, and then I guess I played Call of Duty a little bit. Modern Warfare 3.

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Can't wait to play Black Ops 2. It'll be nice to switch up to something different.

362
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But, yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

363
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
My gaming week, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, but I did decide I finally had it with Mass Effect 3 and Origin in general.

364
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So I am done with the PC version of Mass Effect 3. I want nothing to do with it anymore.

365
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So I went back to Xbox 360 version, which, although it kind of stinks that, you know, the controllers, it's harder to do with the controllers than the keyboard and mouse.

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I got used to it pretty quick. And it is really sad that I really don't have connection problems on the 360 whatsoever.

367
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I have none of those loading problems or delays or any of that shit that you get with Origin.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And it's so refreshing. And I had some characters unlocked on the 360 prior that I just really missed, like my Korean engineer.

369
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect. Lots of that.

370
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Other games, though, besides Mass Effect, believe it or not. LittleBigPlanet Vita.

371
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I played some more of that. I mentioned I touched this game a little bit last week, but I didn't really play a lot of it.

372
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I got to play some more of it this week, and I'm overall pretty satisfied with it.

373
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
A lot of what I said last week still holds true. It's a lot of the good stuff from LittleBigPlanet 2.

374
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
However, I finally figured out why the game wasn't bugging me about the online connectivity when I was playing it last week.

375
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Because the game has an online pass, and I hadn't put in the code yet.

376
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And so when I finally, because, you know, you have to beat the entire first world before you unlock the moon and the community levels and all that.

377
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So once I unlock that, it's like, oh, hey, you need an online pass. It's like you need to enter in the code from the manual.

378
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And I'm like, there's no manual with LittleBigPlanet 2. And I started like, oh my god, did I get ripped off?

379
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But I opened up the box, and there was a code there for, it said, the costumes from the Bioshock characters.

380
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Like, it said, congratulations on your pre-order bonus for Big Daddy costume and all this stuff.

381
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
And I'm like, wait a minute, that's not an online code. And I'm like, I'm going to put it in anyway.

382
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Sure enough, it was the online pass code. I put it in and it said, you've unlocked the online pass.

383
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And I'm like, great. So if I didn't think to try that, I would have thought, they didn't send me one.

384
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So, just a heads up, if you bought your copy of LittleBigPlanet Vita and all you have is a code for a costume, it might actually be your online pass code.

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Just throwing it out there. So, there you go.

386
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
That was LittleBigPlanet Vita. I do like some of the enhancements they made to the online community stuff.

387
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You can download levels now, so you don't have to, like, go connect and find them every time.

388
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Some of the levels online are really stupid, though, but that's to be expected with any creation game.

389
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You're only going to find a few gems in the haystack.

390
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But, yeah, as far as execution, it is what you would expect on a little Vita screen.

391
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And for that, it's pretty awesome, I gotta say.

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Something else I played on the Vita. It's only a demo, and I don't like to review games based off the demo.

393
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But after Shane's strong words last week about how he felt about Silent Hill Book of Memories, you know I had to go download the demo.

394
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And so I played the entire demo, which was a good, I don't know, it was like the whole first level up through the boss.

395
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I didn't hate it, but it's really not Silent Hill.

396
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Like, it is a dungeon explorer crawler game with Silent Hill graphics stamped on it.

397
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,000
And so, like, if I were obsessed with the lore and really into the storytelling, as Shane was talking about on the call at the end of last week's show, I could see where that's offensive.

398
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Like, having Valtiel be the quest giver at the beginning of the floor, some of that stuff's really hokey.

399
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But I didn't hate it. I wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it, but I would totally rent the game for a weekend just to beat it, because I was kind of interested in where the story was going.

400
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Because it was very like, you are the main character, and you're doing all these things, and I liked kind of the haunting memories that were playing on the TVs and all this stuff.

401
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So, I was kind of into the story, so I didn't hate it as much as Shane did, but I get why people aren't into it, because it's not really Silent Hill.

402
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I wouldn't play it after that description.

403
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, I could bring it out here and show it to you, but you'd probably be like, eh.

404
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I don't want to blow infected snot all over it.

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
All I had to do was look at the back cover and I was like, nope.

406
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't think it's that bad, but it's not Silent Hill. That's really the best way I can describe it.

407
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
One other thing I'll quickly say, Smart Glass came out for Android devices.

408
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So I'm sure many of you have checked out Microsoft Smart Glass, because it's on all the Android devices.

409
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And here's where me having an iPhone and Alan having an Android device comes in handy.

410
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So we got out his Galaxy 3 and downloaded Smart Glass to it, and I was playing around with the Xbox on it.

411
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Eh. What's the big deal?

412
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Nothing. It really doesn't do anything right now that the app didn't do before.

413
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I seem to remember the existing app would allow you to control your Xbox.

414
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
How did you use it with Dance Central?

415
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I did use it with Dance Central 3, and the only thing you can do so far, at least that I found out, to be fair, I gave it like two minutes.

416
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But the only thing I figured you could do is queue up songs in party mode.

417
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Alright, I guess that's cool. If I had eight people over, that would be kind of cool.

418
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
To be fair, that's all that Just Dance 4 kind of used the Wii U gamepad for.

419
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Remember, that was one of their big things. Hey, you can queue up songs!

420
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But, you know, it was just a big deal. I can swipe on the menu.

421
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm almost positive the existing Xbox app that was out there would allow you to remote control your Xbox in the same way.

422
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Like, I don't think that's new. I really don't.

423
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yes you can.

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
So, and then we're waiting for the TV and movie stuff, but none of that's in there yet.

425
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So it's like, okay, they've got the framework for Smart Glass down, now let's see you use it!

426
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Coming in 2013. Usefulness.

427
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Well, it's just like, was it, um, the Xbox Vision Camera!

428
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We've got the framework in place, now let's see the one, two games that are gonna use this.

429
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes, you can make a user icon out of your face. That's about the most that vision camera's good for you.

430
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That's all I really use that for.

431
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Can you do, you can't do that with Kinect either, huh?

432
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes you can.

433
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, can you? Well then, so much for the vision cam.

434
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Yeah, it's obsolete.

435
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Alright, uh, that's it for, uh, gaming week for me and for our other hosts.

436
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's talk about housekeeping and then we'll get into the news this week.

437
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Uh, housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

438
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Uh, follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

439
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
We have an interview next week. We haven't had an interview in a while.

440
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Uh, this one is for the old school listeners.

441
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
As you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a show about music-based video games

442
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and for a long time we were pretty much exclusively about like the DDR and BeatMania and music game community.

443
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So it's pretty surprising to me that in our ten and a half year history we've never had this guy on.

444
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Uh, we may have had him on like for five minutes on one of the E3 specials

445
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
but we are going to properly have on the show next week, Eddie from BamaniStyle.com

446
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
is going to be on the show talking about what, you know,

447
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
especially because we have a news story tonight about like DDR's reboot and all this stuff

448
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and I'm not going to spoil too much about that.

449
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
But we really want to get his thoughts on kind of where the music game community is going

450
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
because I'll tell you this, Eddie obviously has a lot of love for the Bamani community

451
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and a lot of the stuff that he did was a lot of the stuff that many of us dreamed about.

452
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He had the Uber website. He started this record label thing or this record distribution thing

453
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
where he was shipping out a lot of the music.

454
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
He got some of these artists to come to ASEN.

455
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
He's really been intimately involved with a lot of the music gaming like today.

456
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So getting to pick his brain on a lot of like music gaming and his thoughts is going to be a lot of fun.

457
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So this is going to be a fun episode next week.

458
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Eddie from BamaniStyle.com will be here.

459
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Sounds super.

460
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I know. And it's live. So you guys will be able to ask him questions.

461
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So make sure you're here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

462
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That is next week, November 4th, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

463
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
All right. I think that's all I have for housekeeping. Yeah.

464
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
All right. Let's get into the news tonight. Loki, start us off.

465
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So G4 has finally canceled the last two bits of the old G4,

466
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
which would be X-Play and Attack of the Show.

467
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And even Attack of the Show is not that old, but, you know, last bit of gaming, I guess, to the network.

468
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And they will basically run until the end of this year.

469
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And then they're going to have kind of a look back at the best of and then their final episodes and that's it.

470
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And then G4 has will be wiping itself of gaming, I guess.

471
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And apparently the rumor is that the channels was this shift towards like a guy network.

472
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,000
They're saying it's like Esquire or GQ channel, which sounds very boring, but cool.

473
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I wonder where Cheaters reruns and Cops reruns fit into that, but we'll see.

474
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Well, to the news that these shows are leaving, this is all I have to say on the matter.

475
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And that's all, folks.

476
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I like the scream. The scream really does it for me.

477
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That was a really good particular Bugs Bunny ending, wasn't it?

478
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's sad, but it's not like we all didn't see this coming.

479
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It was the merger that was the beginning of the end.

480
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I was going to say, without sounding like a heartless bitch, it's really not sad either, I'm sorry.

481
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But, I mean, the biggest talents behind these shows both already abandoned ship.

482
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Sessler left X-Play and Kevin Pereira left Attack of the Show.

483
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And I'm sorry, that show was already done for me the minute they started calling it Attack of the Show and it was no longer the screen savers.

484
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I mean, that's when that show was already over.

485
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And X-Play was good when it was on Tech TV, when it was called Extended Play.

486
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I miss Tech TV so much. It's just like, that was the most awesome network ever.

487
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And then it's like, hey, G4 sounds pretty cool.

488
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And then they mixed them together and it's like, whoa, this is like the best thing ever.

489
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And it went so downhill from there. It's just like, I don't even understand how that's possible, but...

490
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, AcidicVampire in our chat says,

491
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Oh, I thought you were going to play a RuPaul sashay away clip.

492
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I wish I'd thought of that. Next time, next time.

493
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The SEG in our chat room says, man, I wonder what the people who have G4 tattooed on them think.

494
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I forgot about that. They were doing that on E3, weren't they?

495
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I don't know.

496
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm pretty sure they were at one point.

497
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They're like, they better pay for the removal.

498
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Well, look, and here's the thing, especially judging off the Twitter reaction and all this stuff this week,

499
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
like people were like, I'm so sad that these shows are leaving and man, G4, there's no video game thing on anymore.

500
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And all this stuff. And I'm like, you guys are...

501
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
People still have their same presence at E3.

502
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You guys are remembering these shows from three years ago back when you were actually watching them.

503
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
If you all were actually watching them, this news would not be coming because it's all about ratings.

504
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
If they hadn't changed them, people would have been watching them.

505
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Oh my God, the new guy on X-Play was fucking annoying.

506
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I don't... See, I don't even...

507
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I watched the clip. They had a clip of something. I don't even remember what it was about, but it was fucking annoying.

508
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The guy was a total asshat.

509
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Raginator in chat says, personally, I love the shows. Those shows were the reason I subscribed to cable in 2008.

510
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
A lot of people kind of reminiscing on the older G4 stuff.

511
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And yeah, you know, it's unfortunate, but the network was already over several years ago.

512
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Remember when they started showing reruns of Cops? Hello. I mean, come on.

513
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The first downfall was the murder.

514
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And I want to really know where the financial status was that made the merger necessary.

515
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Well, according to Black Wolf in our chat room, and he was pretty intimately involved in the early days of G4,

516
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
and he talks about that on his own show, but Bobby's in chat and says, Paul Allen got tired of tech TV.

517
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's why he sold it to Comcast, even though they were about to have positive ratings for the first time.

518
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So somebody just threw their hands up and said, I'm kind of over it.

519
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm curious. A lot of people talking about the E3 coverage.

520
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You know, for some people, that's all G4 is now, is E3 coverage,

521
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
because they have done the live stuff from the show floor and so on.

522
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So does that mean the tiara goes to Spike TV by default?

523
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
They've already been doing that. Spike TV was live streaming all the coverage through game trailers,

524
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
their partnership with game trailers.

525
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Weren't they like across the street? Oh, okay. They were actually in the...

526
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Yeah, they were doing all of the press conferences.

527
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So Spike had a thing going already. Lately, they've been more of a gaming network than G4 was.

528
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
G4 kind of tried to branch out a bit of like trying to do the whole geek thing,

529
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
and like, you know, oh, hey, here's some quirky stuff about movies,

530
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and it was just, it wasn't working. I don't know.

531
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But I think Spike's all right. They've got, and it's kind of funny,

532
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
you know, if they're going to be shifting to this like kind of guy channel thing,

533
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
that's kind of what Spike's already doing right now, sort of.

534
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I mean, they're not really doing the GQ stuff.

535
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
They're kind of taking more of the lowbrow route to that kind of, you know,

536
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
shows with big-titted women and, you know, stuff like that.

537
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You know, Thousand Ways to Die or action movies.

538
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The thing that I found surprising, however, amongst all this,

539
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
is that with the cancellation of these two shows,

540
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
that means there is one show on all of television cable that is about video games,

541
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and it's that show that Jeff Keighley has on Spike TV where, you know,

542
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
have some Doritos and Mountain Dew with your game trailers TV.

543
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes, exactly. You have some Doritos and Mountain Dew with your game trailers.

544
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But it kind of surprised me because, you know,

545
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I thought video games were supposed to be like the modern version of movies or music,

546
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
you know, some new art form.

547
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And we have tons of shows about movies and TV shows and music.

548
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood.

549
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Who watches Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood?

550
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Old people.

551
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
People that are old.

552
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Grandma.

553
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That don't know how to use the internet or just don't care to watch the internet.

554
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But not to say that that's necessarily a bad thing.

555
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And they could have shows like that because, I mean, hell,

556
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
there's people that work that have locked down internet at work

557
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
or they're working like some place that doesn't have internet

558
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
or that's open and they can look at this stuff.

559
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And then they can get kind of like a quick feed of, you know,

560
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
what's coming out and, you know, what the news is and stuff.

561
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But unfortunately, the gaming demographic,

562
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
a lot of those people are just like internet crazy.

563
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And so the news travels a lot faster on the internet

564
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
than obviously these shows can pick up on.

565
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But it doesn't mean that they can fail.

566
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I mean, a lot of these shows, if they have,

567
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and this is kind of the whole thing with game trailers, TV is,

568
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
they make a lot of news because they get a lot of exclusive interviews

569
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and exclusive trailers and stuff like that.

570
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You're like you're going to see it first on that show

571
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
before you, you know, see it on the internet.

572
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's where the key is to running a successful kind of

573
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
entertainment business, at least as far gaming stuff.

574
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I mean, look at Game Informer, same thing there.

575
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
That's how they were able to kind of, other than, you know,

576
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
coming free with, you know, subscribing to GameStop's card.

577
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But a lot of their stuff is, you know,

578
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
they leverage these interviews and exclusives and stuff.

579
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And so they're the kind of the source of news.

580
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And I also have to say their magazine actually is pretty well designed.

581
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Let me go to the chat room because of course we are the show

582
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
where every gamer has a voice.

583
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And sometimes those voices want to, you know,

584
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
set us on a different path here at live.vognetwork.com.

585
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Black Wolf wants to point out that Electric Playground

586
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
and Judgment Day are still around.

587
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You might know Judgment Day as reviews on the run.

588
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Electric Playground is in syndication.

589
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
A lot of ABC affiliates on the weekends right now.

590
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So I guess for me to say that Game Trailers TV is the only video game show

591
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
left on all of television is a falsity.

592
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So sorry for that.

593
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I guess you could say on all cable because syndication doesn't really hit cable.

594
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
What would syndicated Electric Playground have anything to offer?

595
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Like I don't really give a shit about a review of Halo 2 or something like that.

596
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Well, I would say it's the equivalent of Ebert and Roper.

597
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Although I don't even think that exists anymore.

598
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But at the movies or whatever they call that.

599
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You know, what's the point of that show?

600
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's reviews on movies.

601
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So why not have a show that's review on games?

602
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I get it.

603
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't think it's any different than the Roper or Ebert stuff

604
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
from five years ago.

605
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So that's the niche it's filling I assume.

606
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
TigerConChat says, old people watch those shows.

607
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Young people, they watch things like TMZ.com for all the entertainment news and gossip.

608
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
TMZ is kind of trash though.

609
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You know what I do?

610
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I look at your Facebook.

611
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Here's what I want to know.

612
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
What's happening to...

613
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh, Black Wolf thinks...

614
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, I didn't get this.

615
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Black Wolf thinks that you missed the point that these are new episodes.

616
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
These are not syndicated old stuff from G4.

617
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
These are new episodes.

618
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But it's like Baywatch was a syndicated show when it was new and all that.

619
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So these are new things.

620
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Sorry about that.

621
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I didn't catch that.

622
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I thought you meant to say Halo 4.

623
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Well, if it's new stuff, then that's alright.

624
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, it's new stuff.

625
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I remember watching Electric Playground.

626
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Tommy Tallarico is still doing that stuff?

627
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I believe so.

628
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I think it's still him and that other guy.

629
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Victor... Victor...

630
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
They're kind of annoying.

631
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But I do respect Tommy Tallarico.

632
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But yeah, one of them was really annoying.

633
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I just can't remember who.

634
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I don't think it was Tommy Tallarico.

635
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Well, you know, but then the same thing.

636
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Some people think Ebert was annoying or Roper.

637
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't know.

638
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm sure a lot of people think I'm annoying.

639
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah, that's right.

640
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Let's see.

641
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
What else is going to bring up?

642
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, the TMZ.com bit.

643
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
TMZ is kind of a trash thing, though.

644
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I mean, let's be real.

645
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
All TMZ runs is trash.

646
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And it's the type of stuff that, you know, gets posted on Facebook.

647
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Like, oh my God, Lindsay Lohan with the intervention.

648
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Da da da da da da.

649
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm surprised.

650
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Real quick.

651
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What?

652
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What the fuck is up with her playing Liz Taylor?

653
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I was just about to ask, so where is our trashy gossip site about video games?

654
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Who is the Perez Hilton of video games?

655
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But then Jamie has to go and open her mouth and say that.

656
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So I'm thinking maybe it's us.

657
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
We just saw Victoria post about it.

658
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
We can be your trashy gossip site.

659
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
It made me cry.

660
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
There's just not enough gossip in the game industry.

661
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's just, you know, we can make up speculative rumors about things,

662
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
but I don't think there's really anything like that.

663
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
No one cares about, like, gossip.

664
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Just they like rumors.

665
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What are you talking about?

666
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Nobody in video games cares about gossip.

667
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Are you high?

668
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
That is all people ever talk about is gossip.

669
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
No, they talk about rumors.

670
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Okay, that's the same thing.

671
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Where did Cliffy B go?

672
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
That's gossip.

673
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Cliffy B went to Nintendo.

674
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I have a friend who's on-

675
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Cliffy B went to go bang his wife, okay?

676
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's where he went.

677
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The Wii U is causing all this turmoil within Nintendo and blah blah blah blah.

678
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's gossip.

679
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
What do you mean the video game?

680
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
The video game press thrives on gossip.

681
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yeah, but it's not like celebrity gossip.

682
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I mean, I'm saying that you can't, there's not as much content out there for,

683
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I mean, celebrity gossip, there's people stalking every celebrity out there.

684
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Someone's gonna fuck up, you know, once a day or at least once an hour.

685
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So are you saying that there's no celebrity in the video games industry?

686
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Not big enough.

687
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So why did we just talk about how Reggie Fils-Aime looks like a wax figure?

688
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
There is two celebrities within video games, absolutely.

689
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So let's start stalking him and find out how Reggie Fils-Aime double parked today.

690
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Woo hoo!

691
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,000
No, there's a difference between the A-list of standard celebrity, you know what I mean?

692
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
And then there's a difference between the A-list of geek celebrity,

693
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
where we might care more about, like, say, what Wil Wheaton put on his blog,

694
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
because honestly, he's a really good blogger.

695
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
How many of us can really give a shit about Lindsay Lohan?

696
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm not raising my hand.

697
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
She was in Mean Girls, and that is one of the best movies ever.

698
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But my point, you know, who cares how many more kids, you know, Brangelina adopted?

699
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Don't give a shit. They can afford it good.

700
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Let them raise all those damn children.

701
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Don't care.

702
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But I do care, you know, if, oh, well, so-and-so developer left whatever, you know, company,

703
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
and that means no more of this, or he's gonna be, that's shit we care about.

704
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You know, and that, and we do care about D-list celebrities like Kathy Griffin.

705
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I think you're right, though, about the nerd celebrity thing.

706
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Like, and I'm reminded yesterday, this is a big deal for Understation Live.

707
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Jessica from Understation Live, Iguana girl, she got her question read by Felicia Day in some live chat,

708
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and basically had this reaction, you know, because, you know, Felicia Day is pretty cool.

709
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And like, even, you know, the geeks on her friends list were all going,

710
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
but you know there's people on her friends list that aren't in the whole geeks culture.

711
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Look at that and go, who?

712
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, you know, I've met some famous people before, and I was just like, oh, hi, how's it going?

713
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And I completely geeked out when Wil Wheaton answered a question on Twitter.

714
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I completely geeked out when I met wrestlers back when I was into wrestling.

715
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And I had my moment earlier this year because I told everybody I knew that I got to shake Latrice Royale's hand,

716
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
and like, you know, I met Latrice Royale and she was gorgeous and all that, and everybody's like, who?

717
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And I'm like, it's a drag queen, hang my head in shame.

718
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Or my autograph from Kondo Koji or the other Koji, Igarashi.

719
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Remember the picture that you took of me with him at E3?

720
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I do.

721
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I was like, and first of all, he was pretty floored that my horrible Japanese came across, you know, understandably,

722
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
but still it was, it was, and you know, running into Kojima three years in a row, literally.

723
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Stan in our chat room says everybody's, or excuse me, everyone's idea of a celebrity is different.

724
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That's a very, that's a very good point because I really got to address this topic carefully

725
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
because I really don't want to sound like I have ego.

726
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But I was very humbled and thankful that when I went to PAX East a couple of years ago, I did have people that like came up to me.

727
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And like, I had like a group of people that just came up to me and was like, are you Rob?

728
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You're Rob from Los Angeles, aren't you?

729
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And I was like, oh yeah, I am. Hi, you know.

730
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
There was some random guy at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza, you know, who wanted to talk to us.

731
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Which is, and I was like, oh my God, that's like, it was like as much of an OMG moment for me as it was for you, I'm sure.

732
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Or it's like, you know, I'm like, oh, people like actually do listen to this show.

733
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's kind of a humbling moment. It's pretty awesome.

734
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So anyhow, Stan in chat says I made Latrice Royale in PlayStation Home.

735
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Got a lot of weird looks. Actually, you should just tell him to eat it.

736
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I'll tell you when it was Miss Freaky for me was when I went to Alabama a few years ago.

737
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And they were doing attorney in Biloxi. I think it was in Biloxi.

738
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
No, it was. It was. Yeah, I think it was in Biloxi.

739
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
But anyway, I showed up for some DDR tournament on a fifth mix machine.

740
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And because it was their new fifth mix, they were all happy and we'd had it for a while.

741
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But, you know, it was all cool. And they're like, you're here.

742
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You said you'd be here and you're here. And I was like, hi, everybody.

743
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Nice to me. And then I went to like some 2DX party on a widescreen TV and had to play Karaoke Revolution.

744
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And it was pretty fun. But I mean, it's at the same time, though, it's I prefer it more when it leads to making friends with people.

745
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,000
No one cares about. I'm sorry, Loki. But you're a shut in, too. You don't go out as much as Jamie and I do.

746
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
True. You know what? Our listeners are my kind of people. Most everybody else in the universe.

747
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm like, don't touch don't don't touch me. Don't talk to me. Our listeners.

748
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I'm like, OK, you're allowed to touch me on the arm. All right.

749
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Dave Falcon in our chat room says, I met the nature boy, Rick Flair, in a bathroom in a bar in Tampa.

750
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And I asked him for his autograph. I hope he didn't do that when he was paying, because that's a little awkward.

751
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Like there's there's time to talk to people. Sign it with your urine. I have his DNA.

752
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That reminds me of this scene from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, about Abba. Never mind. Never mind.

753
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Let's move on with the news. The ESRB, the entertainment rating board, entertainment software rating board.

754
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:48,000
They are trying to streamline the release of downloadable games, doing a new rating service that is targeted for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, eShop, WiiWare and Windows 8.

755
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:59,000
This service is no cost. So that's a big like, oh, incentive for people to use this, because, you know, there's a lot of indie developers and people that don't have very big budgets making games for these platforms.

756
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:08,000
So this is a no cost service. What the deal is, you do an online questionnaire and through this questionnaire, you basically self identify the adult content.

757
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,000
What's interesting about this, the questionnaire will also rate a game in terms of what is shared.

758
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:26,000
So there's some new content descriptors in the game that will indicate that the game shares information, shares location or interacts with users.

759
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That's pretty awesome. I've got to say, actually, I love this idea. Even it's like me. I love the fact that I will know exactly which games are going to want to share my location.

760
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Can we see that those ratings on Facebook? I with what they're sharing.

761
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I don't see why it wouldn't work if Facebook games were willing to put it on their Facebook, the website.

762
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, yeah, we should rate Facebook, the website. But that's that's another rating sport that will have to do that.

763
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Apparently, this is very similar to what PlayStation mobile games already have going forward on the rating system.

764
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Some are saying that could have been inspired by that. So very cool.

765
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I love that it's no cost. Let's just hope everybody's honest in those questionnaires.

766
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm almost positive there will be a story in the near future about a game that is missing one of these labels that should have had it.

767
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But we'll see. It's an interesting step forward for now. So I can't see how this is a bad idea.

768
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Looking forward to it. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us? It's new.

769
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You know what that means? More Bimani. So, yeah, Konami has announced that the newest DDR game is just called Dance Dance Revolution.

770
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And they haven't put a whole bunch of details about it, but they're doing their first location test at Tokyo Leisure Land.

771
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Is that next Friday? I think it is. It's already already happened. Yeah.

772
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So, yeah, there's a location test page and everything up now, but is it supposed to do all of its updates of the Internet?

773
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yes, some of the tweets were indicating that like that.

774
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I guess they're calling it Dance Dance Revolution because they're not envisioning that there will ever be a second mix or a third mix.

775
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
There's just going to be one mix that can be constantly updated. Yeah.

776
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Actually, there's a quote on here from So In Love about future DDR series.

777
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I talked with Uson and they named this version as just DDR because they will update it, but no new versions.

778
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And I think that's an Engrish-y post, but still. So they say now.

779
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Well, you guys were all longtime DDR fans. That's the game that brought us together.

780
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
So obviously, I'm sure we all have opinions on this. Loki, what do you think about a new DDR?

781
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I think it's stupid. And I mean, they tried the same thing with the console version and we saw how well that worked out.

782
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It tanked and they said, oh, but we're going to provide lots of DLC for it.

783
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
They provide some DLC and then it's done. Nothing.

784
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You get the game dirt cheap now and there's no DLC support for it.

785
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
So, yeah, I see that totally happening with this where they're going to have some DLC for it.

786
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And here's what I want to know is if they're going to constantly update this game, then how are they going to sell new games?

787
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
They just don't want to make profit off it anymore or they're going to sell DLC to arcades.

788
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So you're gonna have some arcades that have these extra songs and some arcades that don't have these extra songs or.

789
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I think that's how it would have to work, a selling DLC to the arcade.

790
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I kind of think it's a great idea. But remember, this is Japan. This is not something that's being tested here.

791
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
This is a very Japanese centric thing. And for a Japanese arcade where you have karaoke boos that, you know, have their own songs and what have you.

792
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I could actually see this really working. And yes, I think it would give arcades some identity.

793
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,000
They tried it with Tekken, I want to say, was one of the games that they're going to have DLC for that arcades are going to pay for or something like that.

794
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:05,000
The problem is, though, is like it was so they basically kind of excludes all of the other territories other than Japan because a lot of these can't connect to emus.

795
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So they're going to be stuck with basically the default song list, which may not be a bad thing, but it's just kind of what's the incentive?

796
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:22,000
You put out things that aren't specifically Japan licensed for that first release, but all the DLC will have Japan only licenses.

797
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You know, that's what I see happening.

798
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Jamie, what do you think about a reboot of DDR?

799
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Why not? I mean, really, I'm kind of like, but I'll play it.

800
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I mean, I always play the new stuff when it comes out, but I kind of hit a point where I stopped caring.

801
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I'm good for them. I hope it works.

802
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Let's be honest. They've rebooted DDR like four or five times already.

803
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I honestly think Konami doesn't understand what makes DDR good.

804
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And so, you know, with Extreme, they remember we're starting all over again.

805
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And then they had Supernova, and that was kind of another reboot.

806
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And then they have the X series, which is kind of a reboot.

807
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
They did three games into that, and now they're rebooting it again.

808
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I mean, it's like, do you guys not know what fucking makes these games good?

809
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Is that it? You're just kind of like, well, we're just going to draw straws here until we figure out why this is selling, you know, or why people are playing it or not playing it.

810
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They had a strong formula for a while, and people were excited, and then they changed it.

811
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Which I think that that might have been, you know, because, I mean, keep in mind, how long have the guitar freaks in Dramania still been going on?

812
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
How popular is pop and music still? Pop and music is way popular.

813
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And just because they've kept their formula. They haven't kept trying to redesign it. They haven't tried to reinvent it.

814
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And that's what I think the problem they're doing with DDR is that they've gotten away from, they're trying to make it edgy, trying to keep it new, but really it's that quirky classic that people like.

815
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm kind of with Jamie on this. I'm like, you know, and I've said this for years when we were mostly music-based, is I said, you know, DDR really does need to reinvent itself.

816
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And I don't think any of these other, I don't think Supernova or X really were a reinvention whatsoever. None of it really did anything to push the franchise forward.

817
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So I'm a little bit hopeful that if they have to go back and put in this infrastructure to support DLC for arcades and all that, maybe they're going to approach other ideas for the game as well.

818
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Like something to make it a little more competitive or some of this new stuff.

819
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:34,000
I mean, I think a creative reboot would be a great idea, but I don't know if that's really what we're getting with this game, but kind of like Jamie's saying with her point, it's better than nothing.

820
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I'm like, well, sure. Why not? What the hell?

821
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But this whole stance of like, well, we just don't see it. We don't see us making another DDR game. So you're giving up is what you're saying is where you're going to support it with songs.

822
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And if people are interested in the songs and cool, you'll keep releasing them. But let's put it this way. If they're not charging for that DLC, then what's the real incentive for them to do it anyways?

823
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I mean, because they're not helping themselves. I mean, they're not going to sell any more games.

824
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:14,000
If they are charging for DLC, then it all comes down to how much is this stuff costing? Because obviously in an arcade machine, we're not talking like $5 song DLC.

825
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
We're talking probably like, you know, a couple hundred dollars or, you know, whatever for these songs.

826
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And if arcade owners back there, you know, if that's going to be worth it to them, because adding a few songs to machine might not necessarily get more people playing.

827
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I mean, sure. It'll be like, oh, hey, there's new songs unlocked. That was kind of the case with Max 2 and Max and stuff where it's like, oh, man, we unlocked a new song. Let's come on down, play this new song. It was really cool.

828
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:49,000
And it kind of got people wanting to play it because they're working towards unlocking something. And now the way they have it is where it's just like, oh, you get a code and it unlocks something.

829
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:57,000
And then now, you know, it's basically all on this stuff. And then now they're going to have this instead of it being a code, they're going to push an update.

830
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:12,000
This is sort of what I was talking about a lot earlier with Tekken 3. Because people, when Tekken 3 came out, I worked at a Namco arcade and we had people always coming in saying, how many more matches until we unlock somebody?

831
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You know, even though I think they were all on a date cycle, you know, who's the next person? Well, in Japan, they got this person. We must be different here, which they ended up being different.

832
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And, you know, that worked for DDR where you would unlock things. And I really wish that they would go back to something like that. I mean, if they're going to do DLC updates, it just still be unlockable stuff.

833
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:42,000
You know, to keep that excitement, to keep people feeling like there's a sense of achievement that it's a community wide effort.

834
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:59,000
That was always the best part about Max 2 was that community part. So I'm all for that. I will withhold judgment until I actually get to play it, which may not be anytime soon if recent DDR releases are any sign, but I hope for the best.

835
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
What else can I say? Let's move on with news. Loki.

836
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yeah. So let's see. Let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And honestly, this news doesn't surprise me at all.

837
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So the rumor is that the Wii U is not going to launch with all the features on the system. Kind of sound a little familiar with Nintendo's kind of M.O.

838
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Apparently they're seeing right now that the features, including Miiverse and the near field communication, that they won't be on the actual system. You're going to have to download Miiverse in order to actually have it, which kind of seems a little odd to me.

839
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Wasn't that supposed to be what you see when you turn on your Wii U?

840
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yeah.

841
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's weird.

842
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And I guess, you know, obviously later on, they're going to add some other support and stuff for multiple game pads and that kind of thing, which makes no sense right now because no games use it.

843
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But and even the near field communication stuff doesn't really make any sense to have that right now because nothing uses it.

844
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But Miiverse is a little weird that that wouldn't be on the actual console because I don't know.

845
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:28,000
They're saying that it won't be it's possible that it won't be available at launch because considering third parties can't access it right now.

846
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So hold on. Let me let me get this straight.

847
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
How are they going to have any games incorporated?

848
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Exactly. Let me get this straight here.

849
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
So they have this thing that's supposed to tie into these games, but no games can tie into it.

850
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
In fact, it's kind of funny if that's true, because third party games can access it.

851
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
The one of the big games that they showed this whole Miiverse thing was with Zombie U.

852
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
So that was all bullshit that they were kind of pushing our way.

853
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I mean, I don't know.

854
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I think it's kind of retarded that you have a Nintendo system launch without like all the features in there.

855
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Like, remember the 3DS?

856
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Where was the Web browser?

857
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, it didn't come out until months after.

858
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It's like, what?

859
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I mean, you're selling me this broken piece of shit that you're going to patch in the stuff later on.

860
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Why don't you delay the release a little bit and have some actual, you know, have it done?

861
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Why bother pushing this out when stuff isn't done yet?

862
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Or I don't know.

863
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
This is a main feature of the console and you haven't fucking finished it yet.

864
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
It's not that complicated of a piece of software.

865
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
But it is all rumor.

866
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's all rumor.

867
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I mean, Miiverse could be also one of those things that they're going to, quote unquote, patch in day one.

868
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Like, it could be one of those things that they're really working right up to the last minute.

869
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
I mean, I'm totally theorizing just throwing it out there.

870
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Miiverse is one thing, but the other stuff you're talking about?

871
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Okay, near field communication.

872
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Big deal if that's not there.

873
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The whole dual Wii U.

874
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
No, that I don't expect to be.

875
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
We know that's not there anyway.

876
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So, I mean, I do like, I have to say, as much as this opinion may not be popular,

877
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
there's been other Nintendo stuff in the past where they slowly unraveled things.

878
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Like, I seem to remember the original DS and the whole, like, downloading demos and all this.

879
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
That wasn't there when the system first launched.

880
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
That was something that came up later.

881
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
And the whole internet connectivity.

882
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And it was like, that feature was just waiting in your DS the whole time to be enabled.

883
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So if there's stuff like that that we don't yet know about that's kind of hiding and waiting in the Wii U,

884
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
that's kind of cool, I guess.

885
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
No, it's not cool because a system, a modern day system should have the ability to play demos.

886
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Just like the Wii, you know, oh hey, we're gonna have an internet browser.

887
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And it didn't fucking come out until later on.

888
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And then they're, oh, well, we're gonna do this.

889
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We're gonna have this internet browser come out now.

890
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And, oh, maybe later on we'll have a way that you can store things, you know,

891
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
on your SD memory card instead of just backing up your saves on it.

892
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Or, oh, I don't know, how about we just, you know, have a feature now where you can download digital copies of the games.

893
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I mean, they're so far behind.

894
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I mean, all these other companies have been doing this for a long time.

895
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
And it's just like they push it out to their customers like, oh, look at what Nintendo's doing.

896
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
We're offering demos of games.

897
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And everyone's like, fuck yeah, that's amazing.

898
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
This is awfully new technology.

899
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's like, no, it's been fucking done for years now.

900
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
They were doing demos on the PlayStation 1.

901
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And yet, for some reason, Nintendo's unable to give you a demo of anything.

902
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think Nintendo's big thing is that they've been trying to avoid anything that's going to damage,

903
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,000
not necessarily their reputation or their brand, but avoid ways for pirating,

904
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
avoid ways for region outsourcing, not outsourcing is not the word I'm thinking of,

905
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,000
but going outside the region, avoiding incidents for online chat.

906
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:05,000
They're really, really trying, I think, way too hard to preserve their brand.

907
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
And they're sacrificing a lot of the options that people have come to expect from a modern-day gaming system

908
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
for the sake of that little neurosis, I guess.

909
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Well, let me get into this next story because it's almost right up the same alley of what we've been talking about here.

910
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And this really caught wildfire all over the internet because Origin, the ever-popular EA service,

911
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
updated their privacy policy.

912
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And this has a lot of people wondering, how exactly does Origin play into the Wii U?

913
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Because in the new policy, it says, quote,

914
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
By signing up to play EA's titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA.

915
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Information transfer to EA includes your Mii information, email address, Nintendo Network ID,

916
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
friends list, country, language, and date of birth.

917
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So this seems to confirm that Origin will be a part of how you're going to play EA games on Wii U.

918
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
But my thought is, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

919
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Because before we start saying, oh my god, it's going to be Origin on the Wii U, which would be dreadful news indeed.

920
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
If I were to see that Origin logo pop up on the Wii U, I'd be like, it's over.

921
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Nintendo did not convince me, they understand online, this is done, I'm done.

922
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But, hold on a minute, because EA and your Origin account, they also interact with your Xbox 360 account and your PlayStation 3 account.

923
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And your Wii.

924
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Oh, and your original Wii, that's right, they do.

925
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And all of that kind of interfaces in that EA console when you go on there.

926
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So, I mean, like, hopefully this isn't much different.

927
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
I don't think it's any different.

928
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Especially like, okay, maybe it just wants the Wii information, so put your little picture on the Origin account or whatever.

929
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
But I don't think that's a huge deal.

930
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Some other people are learning out of this.

931
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Make sure you haven't done penis face.

932
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah, to also draw out of this, the Nintendo Network ID is seemingly telling, that's a huge part of it, that where's the friend code.

933
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So maybe they finally are doing some type of universal ID.

934
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Is that an ID name that I get to pick, or is that a Nintendo Network ID number?

935
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I don't know, we shall soon see.

936
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So, of course, all the big blogs reaching out to Nintendo for comment, but they're not saying anything right now.

937
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I wouldn't panic, I don't think this means it's Origin on Wii U, at least I hope not, because Origin is terrible.

938
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And it will be a terrible thing for the Wii U.

939
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
If that happens.

940
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
They would never do that.

941
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Like, I would not buy Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U if it has the Origin tie-in, there's literally no point.

942
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Well, it's definitely gonna have Origin, Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U will have Origin, but, yeah.

943
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But in what capacity? I mean, on the Xbox 360, you don't see it.

944
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It's just like the Xbox 360.

945
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Okay, that's fine then, because what it's doing, it's talking to Origin's servers to get your galaxy information and get some of that stuff,

946
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
and update your stuff on the EA social BioWare site or whatever.

947
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
That's fine, because the connectivity isn't happening through Origin.

948
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
But if on the Wii U, the connectivity is happening through Origin, that's gonna be a huge problem for me, because it stinks.

949
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It's horrible. I mean, I never had a problem with Mass Effect 2, even though it registered all my stuff on Origin.

950
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I still played it through Steam.

951
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, technically I played it on its own because I bought it on Amazon.

952
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But I ran it through Steam.

953
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I never had a problem. It wouldn't connect to the servers right when I loaded it up, but I could log in.

954
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I'm not even getting the option anymore with my Mass Effect 3.

955
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Which, if it was the patch, I'm just saying.

956
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:46,000
But I think Origin has something to do with it too, even though I'm connecting just fine through Origin.

957
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So, they just need to get their shit together.

958
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Alright, well, unfortunately these are things we just aren't gonna know until the Wii U actually comes out.

959
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
So, meanwhile, more news. Dark Sakura.

960
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Well, hopefully something better than freaking Origin.

961
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
How about Super Mario 64?

962
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Sixteen years, this game, since this game has come out.

963
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
My husband and I used to play a crap ton of it.

964
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Well, now there is a PC mod for Super Mario 64 that lets you play co-op online.

965
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It was modded by Skelux? S-K-E-L-U-X?

966
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
At least it wasn't Skelux.

967
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Seriously.

968
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Because then the Mario theme would be...

969
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And then it would be dial-up noise, the game.

970
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But it's Super Mario Star Road, which is a site dedicated to Mario 64 mods.

971
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But this one keeps the level design and everything, but makes it co-op.

972
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
You're not playing as Luigi, though, however.

973
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You're playing as sort of a recolored Mario.

974
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I mean...

975
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Luigi.

976
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
But it's not like the taller...

977
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
It's like a gray Mario, gray and red Mario.

978
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So, kind of like a palette swap.

979
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
But hey, it's cool.

980
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I actually want to check this out.

981
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Oh god, Tigerclaw in our chat room is telling me,

982
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Rob, it's been done.

983
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
No! No!

984
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It's the internet. Of course it's been done.

985
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

986
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and some video games that are coming to a store near you,

987
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
hopefully with less dubstep.

988
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Well, we've got a few games coming out this week since we're in the fourth quarter.

989
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So, let's start off.

990
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
They're doing some re-releases of stuff.

991
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
They have the Namco Museum DS and Pac-Man World 3 bundled together on one DS cart.

992
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So, that's coming out.

993
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Also Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur IV are bundled together on PS3 and Xbox 360.

994
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We've got Assassin's Creed III on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and on PC.

995
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Thundercats on the Nintendo DS.

996
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Transformers...

997
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Wow.

998
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Hey, it's probably based off the new Thundercats series,

999
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
which is probably not that good.

1000
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Thundercat... or Thundercats.

1001
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Transformers Prime, the game on the Wii, the DS and the 3DS.

1002
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Also Nike Plus Connect training on Xbox 360.

1003
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Need for Speed Most Wanted on PS3, Xbox 360 and the Vita.

1004
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
That's kind of cool.

1005
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Maybe a Vita game I can actually play.

1006
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Myst on the 3DS.

1007
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Moshi Monsters Moshlings Theme Park on DS and 3DS.

1008
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Toy Story Mania on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1009
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Those are kind of HD redos of the Wii game that came out.

1010
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
The Trash Pack on DS and 3DS.

1011
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Zone of the Enders HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1012
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Let's see, moving on here.

1013
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
We've got the Rockstar Games Collection Edition 1 on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1014
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Includes Red Dead Redemption, Midnight Club Los Angeles,

1015
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,000
the Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City and L.A. Noire for 60 bucks.

1016
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That's not a bad deal.

1017
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Bratz Fashion Boutique on DS and 3DS.

1018
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:36,000
And WWE 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii.

1019
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Lala Loopsie Carnival of Friends on DS and 3DS.

1020
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000

1021
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,000

01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And let's see here.

1023
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on Xbox 360 for Kinect.

1024
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And then, oddly enough, only the portable versions of LEGO Lord of the Rings this week on the DS, the 3DS, and the Vita.

1025
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And Need for Speed, most...

1026
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Or, I didn't mean Need for Speed.

1027
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I think that might be it.

1028
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Oh, and a PC version of LEGO Lord of the Rings this week as well.

1029
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Oh, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation on the Vita.

1030
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Can't forget that one. That's actually supposed to be pretty good.

1031
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Smartass on the Vita and Ragnarok Odyssey on the Vita as well.

1032
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So that's it for this week, I believe.

1033
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.

1034
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:47,000
On November 1st, Medal of Honor Warfighter on the Xbox 360 and NBA 2K13 gets its Japanese release also on the 360.

1035
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Going to the PlayStation 3, Dead Island, Zombie of the Year Edition, Medal of Honor Warfighter on NBA 2K13.

1036
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Okami Zekke Kaiban, this is the HD remaster of Okami, is finally out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1037
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:07,000
And Tales of... Are you supposed to say Zilia or Shilia? Because it's an X.

1038
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Exilia? I think it's Tales of Shilia.

1039
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I think it could be Zilia.

1040
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Zilia? Alright, whatever. Tales of Zilia 2 is out this week.

1041
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And there's even a version that comes with a new DualShock controller and all this stuff.

1042
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I think Xylophone, Rob.

1043
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
All these different little limited editions coming with that, so that's pretty exciting.

1044
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That must be a major holiday release in Japan.

1045
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Nothing on the Vita this week, really.

1046
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And just checking the 3DS real quick to see if we have anything there.

1047
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
A black Nintendo 3DS XL and then one that has Monster Hunter 3G as well.

1048
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Oh, World Soccer Winning 11, 2013. There you go, soccer games.

1049
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
That's it for Japanese releases, Dark Sakura.

1050
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Ah, I just dropped my yarn.

1051
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Oh, noes.

1052
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Hold on.

1053
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
As I had the list up.

1054
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Coming out on the 30th, we have Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation for Vita.

1055
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Sorry if I sound weird, I just took a cough drop.

1056
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
31st, Assassin's Creed 3 for 360 and PlayStation 3.

1057
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Sports Champions 2 for PS3.

1058
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And now I have to move on to November's dates.

1059
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Stupid thing.

1060
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
November.

1061
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
On the 1st, we have WWE 13 for a number of systems.

1062
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:38,000
On the 2nd, Football Manager 2013, Just Dance 4, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Nike Plus Connect Training, Silent Hill Book of Memories.

1063
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
That's it.

1064
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Alrighty.

1065
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Just a few more news stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

1066
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
What did Dark Sakura pick this week?

1067
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Find out after two more stories.

1068
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Loki.

1069
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Well, it's unfortunate that we have to report on more closures and layoffs.

1070
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But Zynga has laid off 5% of their workforce.

1071
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Kind of a restructuring that they're doing.

1072
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
They let go roughly 3200 employees.

1073
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
And with that, they've closed Zynga's Boston studio.

1074
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And also, the studios in Japan and UK are being kind of slated for shutdowns soon.

1075
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Also, the Austin office, they've laid off quite a few people there.

1076
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And they've also shut down, I guess, 13 of their older games.

1077
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And what they quote, significantly reducing their investment in The Ville.

1078
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Probably a good thing being since, you know, they're being sued by EA for The Ville.

1079
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So, it sounds like the outlook on that is not too favorable.

1080
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
That's kind of disappointing.

1081
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
You know what Dan told me?

1082
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
He said that their stock right now is lower than Radio Shack.

1083
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Ouch!

1084
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

1085
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Alright. I got one more story for you too.

1086
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
By the way, that was shady that they did that during the whole Apple conference.

1087
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Like, a lot of people assumed that was intentional.

1088
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Maybe it really wasn't.

1089
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Just to give Zynga what little shred of doubt I can,

1090
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
maybe that actually wasn't intentional that they did it during the Apple conference.

1091
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Because seriously, how are you going to hide something like that?

1092
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
You think the internet wouldn't notice?

1093
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Come on.

1094
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I think it was just a coincidence. I really do.

1095
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
But it really didn't make them look good, that's for sure.

1096
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Windows 8 came out this week.

1097
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I don't know how many of you guys are excited about Windows 8.

1098
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Can I quote a movie?

1099
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
What?

1100
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Whoopty shit.

1101
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Well, you know, I don't know. I'm trying to judge my Facebook.

1102
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Some people went and got it the day it came out and they're actually really excited about it.

1103
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Like, they're really enjoying it.

1104
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So, I don't know.

1105
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm going to give it a couple months before that whole super sale's done at the end of January to see if it's something I really need.

1106
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But, I bet you're dying to know.

1107
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
What about the games?

1108
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
What are the games that come with Windows 8?

1109
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Well, let's tell you about the new games with Windows 8.

1110
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Microsoft Solitaire Collection is one of the games in Windows 8.

1111
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Which, of course, it's Windows that's got to have Solitaire, right?

1112
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Remember, these all have achievements and stuff, too.

1113
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:23,000
There's, like, Klondike Solitaire and Pyramid and, you know, all the stuff you'd be used to.

1114
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Minesweeper is back in Windows 8.

1115
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
But, here's the crazy part.

1116
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Minesweeper now has an adventure mode.

1117
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
What?

1118
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
No one, Kerr.

1119
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Look at the screenshot.

1120
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It's like little explorer dude going through the cave.

1121
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Yep.

1122
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Hey, you know what?

1123
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
As much as you say no one, Kerr, I got to say it looks better.

1124
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Mr. Driller did it better.

1125
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Whatever.

1126
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Other games within Windows 8.

1127
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Microsoft Mahjong, which I think they've kind of been including ever since, you know, Shanghai.

1128
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
The old PC game was popular.

1129
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I love Mahjong.

1130
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Wordament is a new game.

1131
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
And this is your basic, like, boggle clone.

1132
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
There's a lot of word games like this that exist there.

1133
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
The game also exists on Windows Phone 7, just so you know.

1134
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Tap Tiles is another game that's included in Windows 8.

1135
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And lastly, a game called Adara.

1136
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It's kind of got like a little story that goes with it.

1137
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
A stone and sorcery magic type game, but it's more like a puzzler.

1138
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Don't get like a, you know, I don't know.

1139
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
But, yeah, it's like a very simple type of adventure game.

1140
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So, that's another free Windows 8 game.

1141
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
So, there you go.

1142
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
We've come a long way since the days of just good old Solitaire with the bouncing card when you finish, right?

1143
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
You know what, Rob?

1144
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
The moment that you said that, my brain instantly went to like a Virginia Slims ad.

1145
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
How so?

1146
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:51,000
With like gamers, you know, sitting around making shit faces at, you know, Windows 8.

1147
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And it has, you've come a long way, baby.

1148
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:03,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, work.

1149
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Alright, let's travel back to when Solitaire was all you got.

1150
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
A classic time in gaming's past.

1151
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1152
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Dark Soccer is going to open up the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you, listen, classic game, play, now.

1153
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1154
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Classic game of the week is Panzer Dragoon, which I thought that I had done it before, but I had done Saga or RPG as we got it.

1155
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Or as, I'm sorry, as it came out in Japan.

1156
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
So, Panzer Dragoon is a rail shooter by Team Andromeda.

1157
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
It came out on the Saturn in 1995.

1158
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And then later on, there were other versions for PC, PS2.

1159
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And it came as a bonus in Panzer Dragoon order on Xbox.

1160
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:02,000
So, you basically play as Kael Fluge, who is unnamed in the US version.

1161
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
And basically, you just go through and you shoot stuff.

1162
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But the game's freaking gorgeous.

1163
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I mean, people gave the Saturn shit for its 3D, and yeah, it didn't do 3D as good as the Playstation did.

1164
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,000
It was built originally as a 2D machine, but this game really illustrated what you could do with the Saturn.

1165
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
So basically, you have machines and monsters as your enemies.

1166
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And it's sort of like a post-apocalyptic fantasy world.

1167
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:44,000
So you have to go through, you've got the different boss battles that actually pause the game before the boss battles.

1168
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And then you have X and Y axis that you can move across on for those boss battles.

1169
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But basically, you can look all the way around.

1170
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I mean, your enemies are coming from everywhere, but you're still on rails.

1171
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So you've got two weapons. You have a handgun.

1172
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And then you have a homing laser that your dragon fires.

1173
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
It has six levels, each one about five minutes.

1174
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
And then there's a boss battle.

1175
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And the sixth, though, is a special boss battle.

1176
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I have to say that, just going back into this one.

1177
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Now, I played a little bit of it, but you know how I get with certain games.

1178
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I'm with Emotionsick. This is one that made me Emotionsick.

1179
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,000
However, since this was a Sega game, of course it was out on the Saturn.

1180
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:43,000
It started off, though, as a different project.

1181
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And they said that they were trying to develop a shoot-em-up game.

1182
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
And it eventually evolved into Panzer and Dragoon.

1183
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So, yeah, pretty awesome game.

1184
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:02,000
But they were under a big time frame for actually developing it.

1185
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And the original name of the game was actually Kikuryu, which is armored dragon.

1186
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But they wanted to pick something that sounded a little bit more exciting.

1187
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So they picked a German name, Panzer and Dragoon.

1188
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
And there you go.

1189
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
That's it?

1190
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
That's it.

1191
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
What a pretty game, though, especially for its time.

1192
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
That's a gorgeous game.

1193
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Well, it was actually named the best Saturn game of 1995 by EGM.

1194
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
RIP.

1195
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And this game also sold well enough that they could do Panzer and Dragoon's V.

1196
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Which, of course, is keeping with that German naming.

1197
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It was also one up, give it a retro review of 8 out of 10.

1198
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
So, not bad.

1199
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Alright.

1200
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
There it is, Panzer and Dragoon, your classic game of the week.

1201
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Good pick, DarkSakura. Good pick.

1202
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Well, thank Dan.

1203
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Alright, good pick, Dan. Good pick.

1204
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Alright.

1205
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I was like, what should I pick?

1206
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
You can bring Dan back to the show. We have a fourth mic now.

1207
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Thanks to the kind, benevolent people at Pod Culture.

1208
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
If you have Dan all the time, then it's not special.

1209
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
You must like my life. I mean, wait.

1210
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Alright.

1211
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That's going to do it for part A.

1212
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
But don't go anywhere. We have a very busy part B when we come back.

1213
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
We're going to do some rapid fire news.

1214
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
The Fugu question of the week and listless.

1215
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1216
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1217
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,000
We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 28th of 2012,

1218
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
with the 479th episode of our show.

1219
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Getting into part B and we'll be doing some rapid fire news

1220
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
and the Fugu question of the week and a special listless tonight.

1221
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
But first, we have some breaking news to start off part B.

1222
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Breaking news.

1223
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
The eighth annual podcast award nominees are in at podcastawards.com.

1224
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And we got nominated!

1225
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio is a nominee for Best Gaming.

1226
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
And there's ten shows in the gaming category,

1227
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
including a couple that also got some bigger nominations

1228
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
for People's Choice and Best Produced.

1229
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
So it's going to be some big competition this year.

1230
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And unfortunately, kind of on the downside,

1231
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
a lot of these are corpcasts this year.

1232
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I soon remember last year it was all indie podcasts.

1233
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
And there are some indie podcasts in this list.

1234
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Like, I recognize Gamertag Radio is a great show.

1235
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Minecraft Me, I think, is indie.

1236
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I don't know where some of the...

1237
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I imagine The Independent Characters is one, too.

1238
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So there's some other good shows in the air.

1239
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
So we want one of the indies to win.

1240
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Obviously, we would really like it very much if it's us.

1241
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
A specific indie to win.

1242
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yes, we very much want this specific indie to win.

1243
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
However, if we can't, we really hope one of the indies takes it.

1244
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So good luck to the indies in here.

1245
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
As far as the corpcast goes, you're going down.

1246
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
So podcastworks.com.

1247
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Power to the people, yo. Power to people.

1248
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
The Daily Voting, and I don't know all of those shows,

1249
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
so I apologize if you are an indie show and I did not name you specifically.

1250
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I will do more research before voting opens on November 1st,

1251
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
is when the voting opens.

1252
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So there you go.

1253
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:49,000
We will be trying to whore for your votes like crazy come November 1st,

1254
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
because we are going to need them.

1255
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
And you can vote every day.

1256
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yes, you can vote every day.

1257
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So we will be reminding you every day. So please help.

1258
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Remember, we don't ask for money.

1259
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
We don't ask for, you know, subscriptions.

1260
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
We don't have a plus feed or something that you pay extra money to get.

1261
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:09,000
All we want, we want your votes to help us spread the word.

1262
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm not saying that, you know, obviously we want legit votes,

1263
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
but they do allow one vote per email address.

1264
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, Rob, aren't you torn that Horde House did not get nominated?

1265
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Actually, it's much easier this way,

1266
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
because then I only have to champion for one show to get votes,

1267
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
because that would be weird if the other show had gotten nominated.

1268
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I did notice it was interesting that the instance wasn't nominated,

1269
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
because I know they've been nominated almost every year,

1270
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
so maybe they didn't go for it this year. I don't know.

1271
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Also, Four Player Podcast, they've had the lock on this thing for, like,

1272
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
three, four years, because they have a huge fan community, and they're very rabid.

1273
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
They were not eligible this year.

1274
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
That's why they're not nominated, because they won the biggest of the big awards last year,

1275
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
and there's some weird rules.

1276
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
So, they'll be back next year, guaranteed,

1277
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
so if there's any year we actually stand a chance in hell to win,

1278
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,000
it's going to be this year, so please throw us your votes come November 1st.

1279
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
There you go.

1280
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And, unfortunately, I also have to say this,

1281
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
no other VOG show nominated. I looked.

1282
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I was a little depressed, because I know I nominated some,

1283
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
but I guess it was just a lot of competition or what have you,

1284
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
and we were whoring the nominations quite a bit,

1285
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
so hopefully we were able to catch some eyes there.

1286
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:32,000
But we're going to do our best to represent VOG and try to win it for us.

1287
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Like the whores we are.

1288
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So, there you go.

1289
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Thank you guys very much for helping that happen.

1290
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I really, really, really appreciate it, and lots of celebratory stuff in chat right now.

1291
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
I appreciate it.

1292
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
A City Vampire says,

1293
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Will you pay me to vote for you?

1294
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
We'll pay you in hugs and kisses.

1295
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
We are not like the presidential nominees, hello?

1296
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
We don't pay people for our votes?

1297
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Taiki says,

1298
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Fuck the podcast awards after irreligiosophy got snubbed twice.

1299
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Well, you know, I've kind of had some give and take feelings about the podcast awards,

1300
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
because let's be real, it is a huge popularity contest.

1301
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
However, it's great promotion.

1302
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I'm not going to lie, it's great promotion, so we've got to do the best we can.

1303
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
So there you go.

1304
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick gaming news for you guys.

1305
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Loki, start us off.

1306
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So if you like collectible figures, there's going to be some new vinyl figures coming out from Funko Pop.

1307
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:36,000
They've got some Halo 4 figures, very chibi looking.

1308
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
They've got Cortana, and it looks like Master Chief.

1309
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And a couple other of the Spartans, they've got a red Spartan and a blue Spartan.

1310
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
So those should be coming soon.

1311
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,000
I'd get a red one, but make him purple so it could be Donut.

1312
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Or pink.

1313
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yes, that'd be pretty cool.

1314
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And I'm sure you could, you know, paint your own Spartan if you want to.

1315
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,000
But I believe those are going to be available soon if they're not already available.

1316
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I mean, they've got to be probably available now since Halo comes out in a week.

1317
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So, man, it's already a week? Crazy.

1318
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Oh yeah, that's right, because it's election day that it comes out. Crazy.

1319
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Wow, election days are right around the corner.

1320
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
And then all this bullshit will be over.

1321
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Where is my melee?

1322
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I got mine.

1323
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
I got mine like two weeks ago.

1324
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Okay, so Team Fortress 2, they're doing some fun stuff for Halloween.

1325
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Of course, Scream Fortress is coming back.

1326
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And what would come with your staple Halloween thing?

1327
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Why, of course, zombies. Zombies would come.

1328
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And they've got different events going on, including haunted King of the Hill matches.

1329
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Also, they've got, I guess, a game, or was it, Bombinup Con?

1330
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And some wizards and stuff. It's all, of course, you know, Halloween themed.

1331
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And they're going to have a brand new man versus machine mission called Wave 666.

1332
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Which will have undead robot enemies.

1333
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So, neat. And I'm sure there's some unique cats to be had there, because why wouldn't they have unique cats?

1334
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And then, not to be outdone by Just Dance 4, but Dance Central 3 will also be getting Gangnam Style as well.

1335
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And that should be coming pretty soon.

1336
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Also, call me maybe.

1337
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Uh oh, Loki. Uh oh. You know what you said, didn't you? You said it.

1338
01:28:51,000 --> 01:29:03,000
It came on my radio, I said last week.

1339
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
It's like Pee Wee's Playhouse. Whenever somebody says the secret word, you just have to start, you just have to get down.

1340
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I love that gif that's out there, by the way, of the football player that's getting down doing the Gangnam Style dance.

1341
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
They're seeing other artists that are going to be coming soon.

1342
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Justin Bieber, One Direction, LMFAO, and um, yeah, that's all they've mentioned so far.

1343
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Did you hear about the hacking of Justin Bieber's Twitter?

1344
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That was fucked up. Oh my god. That was so fucked up. I am sorry.

1345
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
That was amazing.

1346
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,000
It's one of those things you're laughing at and then you're like, oh my god, I'm going to hell for laughing at this because this is terrible.

1347
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Alright, repeat it for those that may not have heard.

1348
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So I think it was Fortran people that did it hacked Justin Bieber's Twitter and posted that he had cancer and was going bald from his treatments.

1349
01:29:53,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So all these girls started shaving their head and posting little signs that said bald for Bieber.

1350
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
That is messed up. That's hilarious.

1351
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Just goes to show the whole, you know, sheep thing, you know?

1352
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:18,000
That's hilarious. And then they're probably disappointed when he's not really dying from cancer.

1353
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Alright, let's move on.

1354
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Going to news about the Commodore 64. Yeah, you heard me. Commodore 64.

1355
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Super Crate Box is a game that's been out there and it's turned 2 this past week and they did a free iOS version to celebrate.

1356
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
However, what's awesome, they're doing a game called Super Bread Box that's going to be an adaptation of the game on the Commodore 64

1357
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
by the guys who did C64 Cannibalt.

1358
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:53,000
So there's already a YouTube out there. This is going to be available, they say, in early December.

1359
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Check out that awesome soundtrack.

1360
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
God, the C64 was so great.

1361
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Flamethrower.

1362
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Every game needs a flamethrower.

1363
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
A brand new website launched this week that has a lot of people excited.

1364
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Polygon.com finally officially launched this week.

1365
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:19,000
And it's notable because there's a lot of game journalists, like people that were big on Joystiq before and Kotaku before and some other websites,

1366
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
that kind of all came together to form this website.

1367
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And I saw a lot of people on Twitter that were kind of spazzing about the website launching.

1368
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And, you know, it's a nice looking website.

1369
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I don't know. Jamie, have you seen this website at all yet?

1370
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
How do you feel about their design choices on this website?

1371
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Because I actually didn't, I mean, I like the writing, and that's the important part.

1372
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
So I want to get that clear.

1373
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It is really easy to read, but I like when it scrolls to a point and that, is that Skeletor?

1374
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yes. Here's what I don't, I don't like these images that suddenly take up the whole horizontal, intermixed with these vertical things.

1375
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
That's the one thing I really don't like.

1376
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,000
The other problem with that being too is that you're going to deal with different resolutions and this is clearly optimized for max resolution.

1377
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
So it's not going to work for everybody.

1378
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Right. The mobile site's really good looking though. I will say that.

1379
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So congrats to them for finally starting this, but I am going to say one little thing.

1380
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I am going to dog on this here because, you know, we do that.

1381
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I don't get the whole documentary and making of stuff.

1382
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That, that's a little too much ego for me.

1383
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
A little smug.

1384
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It is a little smug. It's very smug.

1385
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And I, you know, all these little documentaries about the launching of the website and the making of the website.

1386
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,000
No one gives a fuck except for you.

1387
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That shit should be organic.

1388
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:41,000
That's, I mean, this feels like forced and it makes me not want to like your website.

1389
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Like to be, I'm just being perfectly honest.

1390
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Now I do like the writing and I like, you know, a lot of the people that are there and ultimately that wins out.

1391
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,000
But I got to say all that self-serving bullshit is kind of unnecessary.

1392
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
That'd be like hosting an awards ceremony where you're going to award yourself for being so awesome.

1393
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I mean, I'm sure that's right around the corner.

1394
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Polygon's awards for Polygon.

1395
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
The, the others.

1396
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And realize that we just told people to please go vote for us in an online award ceremony, but I'm sorry.

1397
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah, but I don't have a fucking documentary about, yeah, like let me start a new website.

1398
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I'm going to create a documentary about starting said website.

1399
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:31,000
The, but really to go back to this though, is that their design, I like, I like consistency.

1400
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:39,000
You have to have consistency with a good website and with it switching back and forth, you're really not giving it enough consistency.

1401
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Plus you're, you know, you're sacrificing memory for people who may not be optimized to use your, uh, your site.

1402
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I prefer it to keep a constant format.

1403
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I like the large splash image up at the top and then the site going into it.

1404
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I like the three column your, uh, point of view.

1405
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I just think that you need to pick a style and stick with it.

1406
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Um, but at the end of the day, of course the writing is the most important and they do have some really interesting in-depth articles.

1407
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Writing doesn't do anything if you can't find shit.

1408
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Snap.

1409
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
All right.

1410
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Uh, let's move on to one other quick thing I want to get out here.

1411
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Uh, Jason, one of our, um, co-hosts, we sometimes have a guest host here on the show and our lovely webmaster of orange-on-street.com wanted me to plug this.

1412
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And to this I say, but of course.

1413
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Uh, how many of you are fans of the website GitHub?

1414
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:33,000
GitHub's a pretty awesome site for, um, developers, programmers, and, and basically nerds.

1415
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Let's be, let's be honest.

1416
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It's a super nerd site.

1417
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Well, uh, GitHub is going to be doing a game jam of their very own.

1418
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Uh, there you have the entire month of November to create a web-based game and it's got to be loosely built around one of these themes.

1419
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Forking, that's forking like a spoon or a fork, or forks.

1420
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Branching or branches.

1421
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Cloning or clones.

1422
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Pushing or pulling.

1423
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
What do we mean loosely based?

1424
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
They mean loosely based.

1425
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Like, you could do a first person shooter where you throw forks and so on and so on.

1426
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Some of the prizes.

1427
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Shiny new iPads with retina displays.

1428
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Ooh, ah.

1429
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Uh, GitHub swag and so forth.

1430
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:20,000
And, you know, featuring on the GitHub blog, which considering that this is a pretty popular website with nerds is, uh, probably reward enough in itself.

1431
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And, uh, some, also some, uh, FaceTime in front of some pretty, uh, great judges here.

1432
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
You have the CEO of Garage Games, co-founder of Lost Decade Games, et cetera, et cetera.

1433
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So, uh, check that out.

1434
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It's called the Game Off and it's, uh, featured at github.com.

1435
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I know you said Game Off, but for a moment I thought you said Game Moth.

1436
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I was thinking of this little moth with big rainbow wings flying around to, uh, Abba.

1437
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So.

1438
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Awesome.

1439
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
All right. Well, that's all I have.

1440
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Dark Soccer, what's up next for you?

1441
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I have more stuff.

1442
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And a voice that's failing.

1443
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Um, Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition is coming out for PC for 1990.

1444
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Um, it has Warp Zones.

1445
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Yeah, Warp Zones.

1446
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Then, um, there is a, uh, uh, nine minutes of footage up for the Mass Effect 3 prequel,

1447
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
uh, which is, uh, Paragon Lost, which I think I'm like the only Mass Effect fan that's really excited about this.

1448
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So I don't know.

1449
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I'm going to check it out.

1450
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It's Vega. It's about Vega.

1451
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
But, oh, hi, Marco.

1452
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Um, so, uh, you've got Freddie Prinze Jr., you know, playing Vega with his, you know, not very good, you know, Spanish.

1453
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
That's loco.

1454
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Um, but it should be, uh, the actual DVD and Blu-ray will be out on December 28th in the US.

1455
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Although there is not a date, um, on, uh, for the UK yet.

1456
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Give it time.

1457
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
So, yeah, you can find the footage out.

1458
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And then, um, there is a, uh, Halloween bundle, um, from Indie Royale.

1459
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Um, it has, uh, Sam and Max, The Devil's Playhouse, the full season.

1460
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It has a home.

1461
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
It has Pathologic, um, McGuffin's Curse, and Evil Quest.

1462
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And if you, uh, pay over $8, you also receive, um, a flak or MP3 copy of C. Jeff's, um, chiptune album, um, Presh Tale.

1463
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
So there it goes.

1464
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
You know, I was hoping that McGuffin's Curse, I kind of read that as McGruff's Curse.

1465
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I know.

1466
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Take a bite out of crime.

1467
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
It's a, it's a noir, a film noir game starring McGruff, a crime dog.

1468
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Whatever happened to McGruff, the crime dog?

1469
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I think he got replaced with something more hip and young.

1470
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Cause, you know.

1471
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Dude, McGruff was cool.

1472
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
What could be more hip than McGruff?

1473
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I don't understand.

1474
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Uh, I don't know.

1475
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
1981.

1476
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Let me take a look at this.

1477
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Good lord.

1478
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
Look at this. I love you, YouTube. Here we go.

1479
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
You know what I think? I think you forgot to lock your door.

1480
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
A lot of people do that. They forget.

1481
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:19,000
That's too bad because all crime needs is a chance.

1482
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Don't give it the chance.

1483
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It's my job to teach you to protect yourselves.

1484
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Make it your job to learn.

1485
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Write to Box 6600 Rockville, Maryland.

1486
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Oh, and one more thing.

1487
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Lock your door and take a bite out of crime.

1488
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,000
I don't understand, like, that was a commercial on TV.

1489
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Lock your damn door.

1490
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
When I was a little kid, we actually didn't lock our doors that much.

1491
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I guess that's true. Growing up, you know, and it was different times.

1492
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
And especially if you lived somewhere a little more rural, there's still a lot of places like that.

1493
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I didn't live somewhere rural. I lived in the suburbs.

1494
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
But there's a lot of places still like that.

1495
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
That they don't lock their doors at night.

1496
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And, you know, McGruff would like you to take a bite out of crime.

1497
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Oh my god, they had the drinking and driving commercial on there with the two beer mugs.

1498
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That was awesome.

1499
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
That used to be my favorite commercial because it was like breaking noises and beer.

1500
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
They had a McGruff the crime dog monster truck.

1501
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Rama in chat says, I remember when McGruff the crime dog came to my elementary school.

1502
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Did he take a bite out of the principal?

1503
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Stan says he was fired when they found a dead prostitute in McGruff's car.

1504
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Oh, well, that answers everything. Thank you.

1505
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
It's always the dead prostitutes.

1506
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
They find themselves everywhere.

1507
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
God, they ruin everything. Damn those dead prostitutes.

1508
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Alright, let's take a bite out of the Fugal Question of the Week.

1509
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Why, you take Facebook and you take Google Plus and you sandwich them together and you get Fugal.

1510
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
It's the Fugal Question of the Week.

1511
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And, you know, with all the hurricane stuff going on in the world,

1512
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
they have me thinking about storms, knocking out the power and all this.

1513
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:09,000
So, the Fugal Question of the Week, available at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community is,

1514
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
tell us a story about a time when game over came too soon.

1515
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
In other words, have you ever had an experience where you were really into playing a video game

1516
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
and then suddenly the power went out, the internet went out,

1517
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
a parent came in and turned off the system while you were playing.

1518
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
How did you react?

1519
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Alright, well, I'll get to the host in a minute.

1520
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Yeah, something just popped into my head.

1521
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Let's start with act-deaf.

1522
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I remember one night when playing Outrun on XBLA on Bobby Blackwell's Friday night gaming show.

1523
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I got the game on the last minute and got into the last race of the show.

1524
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I was kicking ass when suddenly my connection dropped.

1525
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I seriously was pissed as hell, especially since I was bragging how good I was at racing games

1526
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
to have that happen in the middle of a live stream.

1527
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
That's what you get for talking all that smack.

1528
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Alright, let's see.

1529
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Panaxium answers the question.

1530
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It says, for me, it was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

1531
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I was trying to beat that obnoxious final boss for over an hour.

1532
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:13,000
When I was finally about to beat the damn thing, my dad gracefully trips over the GameCube cables,

1533
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
yanking the power out of it.

1534
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I remember doing Evader-style, no!

1535
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,000
He looked at the blank screen a few seconds, then turned to me with a big dorky grin and said,

1536
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
sorry, I'm prone to power trips.

1537
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
That was horrible.

1538
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
That was some punishment for the show.

1539
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
And Panaxium ends it with, thank you so much for that, dad.

1540
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
I'm prone to power trips.

1541
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Let's see.

1542
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Going to Facebook to get some of the questions here.

1543
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Let's see.

1544
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Brandon H. answered the question and said,

1545
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
just unlocked everything in Guitar Hero 3,

1546
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:06,000
then in the middle of saving the power went out and then it came back on,

1547
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Red Ring of Death and Corrupted Saves.

1548
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:15,000
That was a really bad day, to have your machine Red Ring of Death on top of the power failure

1549
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
and corrupt your saves.

1550
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
That sucks.

1551
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Let's see.

1552
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Joe G. answers on Facebook and says,

1553
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
oh, excuse me, I used the wrong name.

1554
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
So you have to put it at the beginning or I might miss it.

1555
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Haseo Sumeruagawa says,

1556
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I was playing Borderlands.

1557
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I was on Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot and I was playing the last arena there

1558
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
and was about three quarters of the way through

1559
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
and I had finished all other quests from the games and Zombie Island is rolling.

1560
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I died, got booted out and I played the whole thing offline, mind you,

1561
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
so when I died I was shit out of luck

1562
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
and what the fuck did the autosave and power flipped off,

1563
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
corrupting the save data and I think people in Texas heard me yelling obscenities.

1564
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Burr replies,

1565
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Growing up I always remember getting kicked off the computer mid-game

1566
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
because my mom wanted me to take a break and go outside.

1567
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I always end up spending my time away from the game thinking about what was going to happen next

1568
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,000
and it would continue on to the next day during school.

1569
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,000
You can physically separate a gamer from their drug, but you can't keep it out of their mind.

1570
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
James S. replied and said,

1571
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
When I was about six years old I was playing Yoshi's Cookie on the original Game Boy.

1572
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
That game was awesome, just saying.

1573
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I love that game on the SNES.

1574
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
You're marked that for a classic game some week because I love Yoshi's Cookie.

1575
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Out of frustration on a high level I proceeded to rage

1576
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,000
and I slammed the Game Boy against my head, causing the screen to shatter instantly.

1577
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Keep in mind I was six. I've never been so mortified yet satisfied in my entire life.

1578
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Ouch. Have you ever, like, has your rage ever broken something that was like several hundred dollars like that?

1579
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Dan, back in the day, would break controllers.

1580
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:07,000
And one time he took a controller back, he bought a new controller and then returned the controller,

1581
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
except he returned the broken controller.

1582
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I think it was like a Saturn controller.

1583
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Wow.

1584
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Ronnie B. answered and said,

1585
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
When I first moved to where I am now the breakers would trip every day,

1586
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
often erasing hours of my Civ progress on the 360.

1587
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I also hate when broken games, often downloadable games, glitch so badly the only option is to restart

1588
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
due to locked menus, stuck cameras, or whatever.

1589
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
SSJ100Matt with an arcade answer. I like this.

1590
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Back when I used to play a lot of Initial D in the arcade during my college years,

1591
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I once lost my entire record and stats for my main car in the game.

1592
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I was in the process of transferring my data from Initial D2 to Initial D3 and the machine errored out

1593
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,000
and my card got jammed inside the machine.

1594
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Since my Initial D2 card was already voided because of the transfer, I lost everything.

1595
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Several months worth of work on my main car was gone forever.

1596
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Needless to say I was frustrated, but after it happened I quit playing Initial D.

1597
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:12,000
All the work that went into building that one car and then losing it got rid of my inspiration and drive,

1598
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
pun intended,

1599
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
to play the game anymore then.

1600
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Let's see, I'm going to do one more answer here.

1601
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Hitstun says,

1602
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,000
A few months ago I was at KDB in Columbus and saw a couple of guys playing the Tekken 6 machine.

1603
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
They finished their match, I asked if I could play winner and they let me join in.

1604
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:38,000
At the character select screen I put in my card with my character on it and the cabinet froze.

1605
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
The other guy was not too pleased and he asked,

1606
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Did you do that on purpose? Why did you have to end my game?

1607
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I felt terrible. Maybe my card got corrupted somehow and I just ended a good play session between friends.

1608
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Eventually I had them follow me to go track down an attendant so we could both get refunds.

1609
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
The Tekken 6 cabinet eventually rebooted but neither of us went back to play it again.

1610
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Those are some good answers and I didn't read everything, I apologize,

1611
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,000
but go check out the rest of the answers at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or our Google Plus community.

1612
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Let's go around the room and see if anybody has things to share.

1613
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Dark Soccer, I know you said you had something.

1614
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:19,000
When I was in high school my little brother Matthew got hit by a car.

1615
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:27,000
He was six and that night basically I got dropped off at the mall with my best friend Jennifer.

1616
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
We went to the movies, we went to the arcade because basically there's like here's some money.

1617
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I ended up getting in on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game in the arcade.

1618
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
This was the first time I'd ever played a full four player game.

1619
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
They had me on Leonardo so I was like okay he's kind of cool.

1620
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:54,000
We got all the way to the end of the game, had just got the last hit, and they shut off the machines.

1621
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:01,000
We were all like noooooo! It was pretty bad.

1622
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Loki, can you think of a story? I have one while you're thinking.

1623
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't have a lot of good ones but do you know how old NES is?

1624
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,000
He had to blow on the cartridge to get him to work and then sometimes the game would just spontaneously reset.

1625
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Like right in the middle. Yeah, that happened to us the night my friend and I decided to play Super Mario Bros. 3 from start to finish with no warping.

1626
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Around like world six or seven. Like if something hit the ground too hard, which I think is what happened, I think we dropped something on the ground.

1627
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
And it just threw everything off balance enough so it was like, reset!

1628
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Noooooo! Everything was ruined and we gave up and moved on. Loki?

1629
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I don't really have anything that I remember as far as power outages and stuff like that.

1630
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:54,000
The only thing I can remember is that I was making a pretty awesome level or game in ZZT.

1631
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:59,000
And I had it backed up to a floppy disk and then the whole thing got corrupted.

1632
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:06,000
And all that work, it was like a month worth of work and it was just gone.

1633
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
What happened to me on The Sims House?

1634
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Can we take a moment to remind our listeners of the mutual love we have for the game ZZT?

1635
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I wish there was something like that again.

1636
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
There's still Megazooks that's still out there.

1637
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Do they still make stuff for ZZT?

1638
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Megazooks, yes.

1639
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Oh, right.

1640
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
The new one.

1641
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That's amazing.

1642
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Anyway, sorry Dark Sakura. He said the magic word.

1643
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I one time spent four hours working on The Sims House and forgot to save and then the power went out.

1644
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
We should have a VOG ZZT contest.

1645
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I've thought about it. I seriously have.

1646
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
You and I would be the only ones that would enter.

1647
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Yeah, unfortunately.

1648
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
You know what? Prove me wrong.

1649
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:52,000
If there's interest in a ZZT VOG contest, email the show and tell us you're interested and you'd participate.

1650
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
And we will put something together.

1651
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Alright.

1652
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to listless tonight.

1653
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
But first, Loki.

1654
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
So, the PS3's been hacked again.

1655
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Sort of.

1656
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Basically what happened was a hacker group called the Three Musketeers finally released the level zero keys.

1657
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:23,000
And not necessarily the way to get those keys themselves, but the keys will be useful as far as decrypting new firmwares that come out.

1658
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And basically re-encrypting them in the 355 keys to run on hacked consoles.

1659
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
So, really there's no way to block that.

1660
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:40,000
They did kind of, if I remember correctly, they updated the keys on certain PS3's and stuff now where they use like the 0.2 keys or something.

1661
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
They're slightly different.

1662
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:50,000
So, I think that's why it has to run on the 355 firmwares because anything newer doesn't use those keys anymore.

1663
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:57,000
But, you know, for compatibility's sake they need to have everything, you know, use those keys at some point or something.

1664
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I don't know.

1665
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Honestly, it's been so long since I've looked into the hacking stuff.

1666
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
It's, I don't know.

1667
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:18,000
But, apparently, this is supposed to be un-patchable as far as they can keep using this exploit to forever have custom firmwares on PS3 and run, you know, new games and stuff like that.

1668
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
So, that's kind of interesting.

1669
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
But, we'll have to see, you know, if that's actually going to happen.

1670
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But, as of right now, they haven't really released any new firmwares.

1671
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Although, I have to really, I have to double check that because I think, I want to say I saw something about a custom firmware 4.3 come out.

1672
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Let me see here.

1673
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Debug firmware 4.25 has been leaked.

1674
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Let's see here.

1675
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
What's this?

1676
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Homebrew for custom firmware 4.21.

1677
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Update the DMCA.

1678
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
So, what does this really mean? Is this going to be like rampant piracy on the PS3 now?

1679
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
No more than it already is. It just means that they're going to keep, they're going to be able to keep doing it.

1680
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Gotcha.

1681
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Alrighty.

1682
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Well, I think you'd have to, I would say you have to have, I think, a firmware that's like 355 or lower.

1683
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Which, I don't remember what mine is right now because I haven't updated in a long time.

1684
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
So, I don't think I'm 355. I think I'm newer than that.

1685
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:49,000
But, you know, if you have an older firmware then that means that you'll be able to, you know, they'll translate the old ones so that they can run like a custom firmware on those.

1686
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Or based off those.

1687
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Well, you know the old saying we have on the show, hackers gonna hack.

1688
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And, but at least no personal information stolen, right? It's not that kind of hack?

1689
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Not that kind of hack.

1690
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Okay, because like, you know, a lot of people were, I think there's some misinformation out there because people were saying, did it get hacked again?

1691
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation got hacked again?

1692
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
So, it's not that kind of hack, right?

1693
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Yes.

1694
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Alright.

1695
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Well, I'm going to get into another story here on a completely different note.

1696
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:29,000
This is something that has me very excited and I want to see if this is something maybe a few of you out there can recognize by the music, which I love the soundtrack to this game.

1697
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Anyone recognize this?

1698
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Actually, if you played this game as much as I did, you probably heard this song a lot more.

1699
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It's the music from Shadowgate on the NES, but of course Shadowgate existed on some of the early Apple platforms as well.

1700
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
And they did a version of it on Game Boy Color, right?

1701
01:52:52,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Well, get this, Shadowgate is being reimagined and it has a Kickstarter behind it to get it funded.

1702
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,000
This is a reimagining of the point and click adventure classic Shadowgate.

1703
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
The original Mac release was in 1987.

1704
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that.

1705
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, they worked on the original Shadowgate with Icom Simulations 25 years ago.

1706
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
They've started this new company.

1707
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,000
They bought the rights to the old Shadowgate game and Uninvited and Deja Vu apparently.

1708
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:34,000
And also got the rights to the 8-bit soundtrack, which apparently was done by somebody completely different.

1709
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
It was done by a Japanese guy who, I guess maybe in the port of the games over the NES, maybe it was done there.

1710
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:46,000
So if you listen to the trailer for Shadowgate, it has a newer version of that music, which is awesome.

1711
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Let me see if I can play a little bit of this for you.

1712
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
But yeah, they're doing a Kickstarter for this.

1713
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:59,000
It's going to be redesigned puzzles and an expanded storyline, but most of the plot devices from the original game will still be there.

1714
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And like in the trailer, you can definitely see the room with the lake, like you used to put the orb in the lake to freeze it.

1715
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:11,000
And you can see the room with the dragon breathing fire at the other end, so there's all of that in there.

1716
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
So very, very cool that they're doing this.

1717
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:21,000
They are seeking $120,000 to do versions for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.

1718
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:29,000
You can do $10 right now to get a DRM-free, and they're really emphasizing that, a DRM-free download when the game comes out.

1719
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
They are projecting 2013 November for that, so it is going to be a bit of a wait.

1720
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
But I will say this, this is only the second Kickstarter ever that I've given money to.

1721
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I did donate to this Kickstarter because I really like Shadowgate, and I liked those old Icom games, so I'm really excited about this.

1722
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I will say this though, I only have so much money. I couldn't do the $130,000 or more, but that did sound really cool.

1723
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:04,000
An original Shadowgate card game. That would have been kind of cool, but a little bit out of my price range personally.

1724
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,000
But I'm sure there's people already, it's already up to $41,000.

1725
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,000
There's that sound again. Let me fast forward. I want to do this part of the trailer here.

1726
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
So you can tell they're totally ready to do this, which is pretty awesome. There's the Wraith. I remember that from one scene.

1727
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
So you definitely see stuff from the whole game.

1728
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
The artwork is gorgeous.

1729
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Oh yeah.

1730
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
I would pay for this just for the artwork.

1731
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Yeah, it's gorgeous. ZOJOY is the name of the company that is putting this together, that these guys started.

1732
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:48,000
So good luck to them, and obviously as a fan of these games since I was a kid, I hope they do it. I really want it. Very cool.

1733
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Let's move on with some more news. One more story, and then we're going to get to Listless tonight. Dark Sakura.

1734
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Oh, I do have another story, don't I?

1735
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Yes, ma'am.

1736
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Well, how about the game Waking Mars? This one is an iOS ecological puzzle adventure game.

1737
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,000
It's actually going to be coming out to PC, Mac, Linux, and Android on November 6th.

1738
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:25,000
It's a revamped version done by Tiger Style Games, and this is going to have high def with voice acting throughout the game and be just a great big step up from the iOS version.

1739
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:36,000
But I mean, this is what was really interesting to me is that they specifically listed Linux among the platforms, which I think is great Linux getting more attention.

1740
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And of course, a lot of people kind of giving Mars attention with the whole curiosity and all that, right?

1741
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Well, there is that too. But this is a game that I kind of had my eye on to play for a little while, and I just never went back for it.

1742
01:56:52,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Excuse me, sorry. But it's a game that was supposed to have really shown off just how great iOS could be programmed.

1743
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And I think I'm definitely going to play this on PC.

1744
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Sounds good. You have to tell me how it is. I'm waiting for your review before I check it out.

1745
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Okay.

1746
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:20,000
All right. All right. Let's get to that time, folks. It is time to bring this segment back. It's been forever since we've done it. It is time to play Listless.

1747
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:30,000
If you've never heard Listless before, what we're going to do tonight is we are going to create the definitive list, the definitive answer.

1748
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:37,000
This is a highly scientific process, the definitive list around a topic. Here's how it'll work, and I'll tell you the topic in a minute.

1749
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
There's going to be four of us playing tonight. We're going to have a special guest join us here.

1750
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:46,000
So everybody help me welcome to the show or welcome back to the show, Alan.

1751
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Hey.

1752
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
How you doing, Alan?

1753
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Good.

1754
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
All right. So Alan is going to be playing Listless with us tonight.

1755
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:58,000
The four of us will give our top three answers. That's going to leave us a list of 12.

1756
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Then we're going to go around the room and each eliminate one answer.

1757
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:05,000
It's a really tough thing we got to do, but it's part of the process.

1758
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That's going to leave us with a list of eight.

1759
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:17,000
And then those of you in the chat room will vote on those final eight answers and help us come up with our definitive list of the top three answers to this topic.

1760
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Here it is.

1761
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Earlier in the show, we talked about that G4 is losing its last bit of video game programming and that it will no longer be a video game network.

1762
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And most of us have thrown up our hands and said, I'm done. I'm out. Later.

1763
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Nice knowing you, G4.

1764
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So tonight's Listless topic, the TV show that would make me watch G4 again.

1765
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It could be an existing show. It could be a new show. It could be anything you want.

1766
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
The show that would make me watch G4 again.

1767
01:58:49,000 --> 01:59:00,000
If you want to give your suggestions in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com in case an answer should get duplicated or, you know, sometimes we just like the chat answers better than our own.

1768
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Make your suggestions in the chat room and we will read some of our favorite answers from chat.

1769
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:10,000
So again, TV show that would make me watch G4 again.

1770
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
All right, let's go around and start building the list.

1771
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
So we will start with Loki tonight.

1772
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Loki, what is your number three answer for a show that would make you watch G4 again?

1773
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The brand new Iron Chef series that they're doing, the Japanese Iron Chef, but translated in English.

1774
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,000
All right. Now, to be fair, the Food Network probably has a lock on this show, but...

1775
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Not yet.

1776
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Oh, not yet.

1777
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Well, I mean, it hasn't started yet, so...

1778
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
All right, that's a pretty serious answer.

1779
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I want new Japanese Iron Chef.

1780
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
All right, new Japanese Iron Chef. There you go.

1781
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Let's go to Dark Sakura, your number three answer.

1782
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Show that would get you to watch G4 again.

1783
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Well, first of all, I never actually watched it, but I would go for Real Housewives Disney edition, like on SNL.

1784
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
So like an actual version of that sketch from SNL, the Real Housewives of Disney.

1785
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Yeah.

1786
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
That's a good suggestion. I like that.

1787
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,000
All right, my number three answer tonight, and I see people saying this in chat right now, so chat and I are on the same page.

1788
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:22,000
My number three answer is Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

1789
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Yes.

1790
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Where the contestants who don't do well at the games will actually get electrified.

1791
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

1792
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
I was going to say Nick Arcade, but that wouldn't make sense, because it's Nick Arcade.

1793
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:46,000
All right, so so far we have new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, and Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

1794
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Alan, what would be the number three answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again?

1795
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
A documentary special. We're responsible for Olivia Munn, and we're very, very sorry.

1796
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
A five-hour apology special.

1797
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Good answer. I'm going to shorten that a little bit to Olivia Munn apology special.

1798
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Now, that would only be one movie, unfortunately, or a miniseries. It could be like a miniseries.

1799
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:22,000
And what things about Olivia Munn should be apologized for?

1800
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Have you seen her face?

1801
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Wow, that's cold. You are cold.

1802
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:38,000
All right, so so far we have new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo, and Olivia Munn apology special.

1803
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Deanna Allers, look at her and go, girl, you need to check yourself.

1804
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
All right, Loki, what is your number two pick for the list?

1805
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
The screensavers.

1806
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
So just bring back the frickin' screensavers.

1807
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
That would give me the watch. That network, yeah.

1808
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Just exactly the way it was. Don't fucking put new people in it.

1809
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Like Leo Laporte, Alex Albrecht.

1810
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Everybody that was in there. Do it the same way you did it.

1811
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Kevin Rose, Dig Didn't Work Out So Well, Get Him Back Too.

1812
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
All right, there you go.

1813
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Dark Sakura, your number two answer.

1814
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:25,000
My number two answer is Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

1815
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Because Glow was awesome.

1816
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
You want Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

1817
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I was addicted to Glow when I was a kid. It was a good show.

1818
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Oh, this was an old show?

1819
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Back in the day, I had Godiva, the woman who wore the skin colored body suit with flowers all over it.

1820
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
And Mount Fuji.

1821
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Hated it.

1822
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Glow was awesome.

1823
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:00,000
My mom used to let me stay up until 1am and watch UHF and see the Glow show.

1824
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
So I might have to vote for that.

1825
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Don't you mean USA? Wasn't UHF like the Weird Al movie?

1826
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:15,000
UHF was a weird movie based off of the alternative band of TV radio that had channels on it, yeah.

1827
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
All right, all right.

1828
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
My number two answer tonight for a show that would make me watch G4 again.

1829
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
The Days of our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera.

1830
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:30,000
There you go. Days of our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera.

1831
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
You mean the shitadel?

1832
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I can't believe, Dark Sakura, I do not have your support on a Mass Effect soap opera.

1833
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,000
What is up with that?

1834
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I would watch it.

1835
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
There you go, see? You would watch it.

1836
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Extra garis.

1837
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
All right.

1838
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:54,000
If Nickelodeon could have 15 as a soap opera, we can have Days of our Citadel.

1839
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,000
All right, Alan, your number two answer for the list.

1840
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
How not to market something special?

1841
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
35-year-old nerds. They're loaded, they're loyal, they're distracted.

1842
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Wait, you need to explain this one a little bit while I figure out how to shorten the answer.

1843
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
What would this show be?

1844
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
The whole basis of the G4 channel model.

1845
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Let's appeal to adult geek, because they have money.

1846
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
They play video games.

1847
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
We're going to put shows on TV that they'll want to watch.

1848
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,000
They still buy lots of video games each year, and they're not watching this yet.

1849
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
We're confused.

1850
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I shortened that to 35-year-old nerd special. Does that work?

1851
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
By the way, you and I turn 35 next year. I just want to point that out.

1852
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
There's something sad?

1853
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
What?

1854
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
My brother, Phillip, yesterday turned 30.

1855
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Well, on the 26th, sorry. The other day.

1856
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
All right, so, so far, we have on the list new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney,

1857
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screen Savers,

1858
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of our Citadel Mass Effect soap opera, and 35-year-old nerd special.

1859
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
It is time. The number one answer.

1860
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
The number one thing that would most make you watch G4.

1861
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Loki.

1862
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Well, I mean, if they're going to compete with Spike, then really there's only one choice,

1863
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:19,000
and that is big-breasted bikini car wash.

1864
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And how exactly would big-breasted bikini car wash be a show?

1865
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:34,000
It's just women washing cars and sudsing up each other with large breasts.

1866
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And would Loki get to be a special correspondent that motorboats the boobies?

1867
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I'll be the host. I'll be doing the play-by-play.

1868
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Nelly will get to motorboat the boobies.

1869
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I would love-

1870
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Or you can just have me, like, you know, in the beginning of each episode,

1871
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I'll drive up the car, honk the horn, kind of smile at the camera, and-

1872
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I would love you and your wife to host a show,

1873
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
because your wife would just walk up to the ladies and be like,

1874
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
how did you let your boobies get so big?

1875
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
You have really big areolas.

1876
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
All right. Dark software.

1877
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
No, no, no. That's just- that's just shameful.

1878
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I mean, they're not going to be topless.

1879
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
I mean, that could be- that could be the whole web series, but, you know.

1880
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
The unrated Blu-ray.

1881
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I'm finding topless car wash, too, but, you know.

1882
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
All right, big breasts.

1883
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I guess it doesn't say- well, they could start off with bikinis.

1884
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
All right, really. But then we're getting the Playboy content there.

1885
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
We don't want to infringe on the other rights.

1886
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I'm surprised you didn't do World Series of strip poker.

1887
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
That's where I thought you'd be going. All right.

1888
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
No one wants to watch poker.

1889
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Dark Sakura.

1890
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Depends on who's doing the pokin'.

1891
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Dark Sakura, your number one answer.

1892
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I would actually watch the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show.

1893
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
If they did one.

1894
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Because I love watching the Angry Video Game Nerd.

1895
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
So you think it's-

1896
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I love watching his movie specials.

1897
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,000
You think it's time for the Angry Video Game Nerd to cross over?

1898
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I think it's time.

1899
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
From YouTubes to cable.

1900
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I almost said ScrewAttack.

1901
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
But, I think the Angry Video Game Nerd would be more marketable.

1902
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Okay, there you go.

1903
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Let's see, my number one answer.

1904
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
And this is big, you guys.

1905
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Every single one of you know.

1906
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
That if this show was on G4, you'd be clicked.

1907
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I am there.

1908
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,000
My number one answer is Loki's Cosplay Challenge.

1909
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
I don't understand what that is.

1910
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Who am I challenging?

1911
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
You would basically go around to different anime conventions

1912
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
and interview people that are cosplay.

1913
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:45,000
And then the viewers would pick their favorite cosplay.

1914
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
And then the challenge would be that you have to imitate it.

1915
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Yeah.

1916
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I don't think I'd watch that.

1917
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Loki's-

1918
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I would.

1919
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Alright, Loki's Cosplay Challenge.

1920
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Alright, lastly but not leastly.

1921
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Certainly not leastly.

1922
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Alan, your number one answer for a show that would get you to watch G4 again.

1923
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
I'm gonna preface this response by saying that I used to watch

1924
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,000
tech TV back here in the beginning when Adam Sessler, the host, extended play

1925
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
out in front of the Metreon.

1926
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
He's very cute. I'm sorry.

1927
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
My number one answer is Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira present

1928
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Black Boxer Reef Boner Boxing, a Gaynard telethon to please, please come out of the closet.

1929
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I just shortened it to Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

1930
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
It works, right?

1931
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Alright, even though there was something about boxer briefs.

1932
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I don't know.

1933
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing works for me.

1934
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Alright, so here it is.

1935
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
The list as it stands right now.

1936
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
The 12 on the list.

1937
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney,

1938
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special,

1939
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,

1940
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Days of our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap,

1941
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Big-Breasted Bikini Car Wash,

1942
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge,

1943
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

1944
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So, unfortunately it is time to go around and take items off the list.

1945
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
It's part of the process.

1946
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
It's painful, but science is painful.

1947
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Loki, which of these-

1948
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Do it for science.

1949
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1950
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,000
There's a lot of them, actually.

1951
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Sorry, Alan.

1952
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Let's do the, uh, let's get rid of the Olivia Munn Apology Special.

1953
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
It's a one-time special, it's not a-

1954
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:50,000
She is on the Daily Show, she is fucking awful.

1955
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:55,000
They are responsible for her and they need to pay reparations.

1956
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:56,000
They need to pay.

1957
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Alright, that's part of the game.

1958
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
At least he didn't eliminate Black Boner Boxing.

1959
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I almost did Loki's Cosplay Challenge.

1960
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Alright.

1961
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
You know, it's for the listeners.

1962
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Alright, and Black Wolf would like to point out they did cut her from the Daily Show.

1963
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And that's why Jon Stewart is the best person on television.

1964
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Alright, the Olivia Munn Apology Special is gone, which makes sense.

1965
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
There's nothing left to apologize for.

1966
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1967
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash.

1968
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Because, because, it's so cliche.

1969
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I mean, why don't you have Big Breasted Monster Truck driving or something?

1970
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Hey, we can have a network based on this.

1971
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Big Breasted Entertainment, the BBB.

1972
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Alright, my turn to eliminate something.

1973
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I am going to eliminate...

1974
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Oh, this is hard.

1975
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I really hate to do this.

1976
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,000
The Dark Sakura, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling's gotta go.

1977
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

1978
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
You never watched it.

1979
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I'm not a wrestling person.

1980
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
It wasn't just that, it was...

1981
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,000
You have UPN for your wrestling needs or whatever.

1982
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
CW or whatever it is now.

1983
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,000
But there's no more glow.

1984
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Alright, I'm sorry.

1985
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Nothing is like glow.

1986
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I'm sorry.

1987
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Will you forgive me?

1988
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Will you forgive me if Pinkberry is involved?

1989
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Yes.

1990
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Alright.

1991
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Uh, Allen, which of these is not worthy of the list?

1992
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Last time I did a list list, I would say that I would be the chat room's voice.

1993
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Because I'm infamous for getting rid of the thing that they most want to win.

1994
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Like President Cat.

1995
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
So I'm trying to look at what they don't want to get rid of.

1996
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I'm gonna say...

1997
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
New Japanese Iron Chef.

1998
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Because I don't see that mentioned at all.

1999
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Alright.

2000
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
New Japanese Iron Chef.

2001
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
It is stricken from the list.

2002
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Alright, so there it is.

2003
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
You are left with...

2004
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
How did 35 year old nerd specials survive?

2005
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I don't even understand that one still.

2006
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Can you explain that one more time?

2007
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
We live it.

2008
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Don't resent it.

2009
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Rob, don't dream it.

2010
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Yeah.

2011
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Alright, let's see.

2012
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Some of the comments from the chat room.

2013
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Some of the answers from our chat room that did not make the cut.

2014
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Shane kind of was onto something because Shane suggested hot guys playing games in underwear.

2015
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
And you sort of did do that one, right?

2016
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
There you go.

2017
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Let's see.

2018
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Tigerclaw says when G4 gets syndicated episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.

2019
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Stan says the late show with GLaDOS.

2020
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Taiki says Clippy B's Drag Race.

2021
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Virtual Phil says RuPaul's PVP Bloodbath.

2022
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:56,000
A lot of folks, Duke Nukem saying Arena, Portal, Icons.

2023
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
And the shows that actually were on G4 some time ago.

2024
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Alright.

2025
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
So here it is one more time in chatters.

2026
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
It is time for you to vote.

2027
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Send Rob Roberts a private message with your number one and number two pick.

2028
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Here it is.

2029
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
There it is.

2030
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Should it be Black Box or Boner Boxing?

2031
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I think Black Boner Boxing.

2032
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
But Black Boner Boxing sounds better.

2033
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
It goes back to our reoccurring theme of Big Black Cock.

2034
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:43,000
But remember it's really guys in black boxer briefs wrestling with boners.

2035
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,000
What was it?

2036
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira's Black Boxer Brief Boner Bonanza.

2037
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Alliteration special.

2038
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Alright.

2039
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Send in your votes.

2040
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Please vote now.

2041
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Send a private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two pick.

2042
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Alright.

2043
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
And while we do that it is time to go to the mailbag.

2044
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Are you going to read these tonight, Dark Soccer?

2045
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Or do I need to?

2046
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Please do.

2047
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
My voice is actually going.

2048
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeloungeradio.com.

2049
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And we pick some of our favorites to read here on air.

2050
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Except I haven't pulled up the mailbag yet.

2051
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I do have it up so I'll just go ahead and do it.

2052
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Wait.

2053
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I'm there.

2054
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I'm there.

2055
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Do you want to do?

2056
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Okay.

2057
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Never mind.

2058
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I'm in it.

2059
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Let's see.

2060
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Where are we going to start tonight?

2061
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Were you going to read all four?

2062
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Yeah.

2063
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Okay.

2064
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I didn't know if you'd screen them or not.

2065
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Professional radio, boys and girls.

2066
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Let's start with ACHP.

2067
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Hey OLR crew.

2068
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I decided to check out a new anime called Aoi?

2069
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I don't know how to say that word.

2070
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Aoi?

2071
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Aoi.

2072
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
It means blue.

2073
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Aoi Sekai no Chusen de.

2074
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
It's touted as being a parody of the old console wars between Nintendo and Sega with gratuitous

2075
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
fan service.

2076
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
And as far as I'm concerned, it delivers.

2077
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,000
It tells the story of the small country of Sega fighting against Ninteldo for control

2078
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,000
of their continent.

2079
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,000
It's only on its first episode as of this writing, but so far they've introduced a number

2080
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,000
of somewhat easily recognizable, at least by Dark Sakura.

2081
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Not sure how massively knowledgeable on classic Sega games Rob and Loki are.

2082
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Parody characters.

2083
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
A blue haired protagonist named Gear who is super speedy and is trying to avenge the death

2084
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
of his beloved friend Teal.

2085
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Okay.

2086
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I know Sonic and Tails.

2087
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Come on.

2088
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Give me some.

2089
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Cut me some slack here.

2090
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Cut me some slack here.

2091
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:40,000
A purple haired sister Nell who is his emotional support like Nii from Phantasy Star 2.

2092
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
The general Hermes.

2093
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,000
He has colored gems on her necklace.

2094
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Maybe a parody of columns.

2095
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
The rival lieutenant with little angel wings in her hair Opal based on Opa Opa.

2096
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Opa Opa Opa Opa.

2097
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I love the Opa Opa.

2098
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And a genius tactician Tetraloth who loves sticking a long stick into things to fill

2099
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,000
holes.

2100
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,000
I'll give you three guesses on what that's from.

2101
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Pornography.

2102
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
A picture for the host's benefit.

2103
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
A little picture there of all the characters.

2104
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Okay.

2105
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I need to see this.

2106
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
That is pretty cute actually.

2107
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I'm getting this.

2108
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I like the little monkey.

2109
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
It's super dumb and has girls clothes coming off for pretty much no reason.

2110
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:23,000
That's all you need right?

2111
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:24,000
That's classic TV right there.

2112
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
And the main villain has a giant mustache.

2113
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
A sword with a mushroom shaped grip.

2114
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
And he rides a flying dragon.

2115
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Seriously.

2116
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Look at how dumb he looks.

2117
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Uh oh.

2118
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh it says no hot linking.

2119
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
What did you do?

2120
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Hold on.

2121
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I got to copy paste this link because it doesn't like me linking it.

2122
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
This is great radio when I copy paste.

2123
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I'm not going to let you because it's insane.

2124
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
So this is Ali Sekai no what?

2125
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Hit that since it's from the website.

2126
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Blue world of what?

2127
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Sorry.

2128
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Uh.

2129
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I don't know.

2130
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Ali Sekai no Chushinde.

2131
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Huh.

2132
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Well I know the first part is blue world of something.

2133
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,000
In conclusion I highly recommend this anime because it's super dumb and pandering to people

2134
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
who like classic games and big boobs.

2135
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
So I figure it would be perfect for OLR.

2136
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Correct.

2137
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
It is.

2138
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
That would be correct.

2139
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Hope you guys check it out.

2140
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Again it's Ali Sekai no Chushinde and you can watch it on Crunchyroll for free.

2141
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
In the center of the blue world.

2142
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Cheers AZHP OLR's premier gold star recipient.

2143
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,000
P.S. there shouldn't be any typos or grammatical errors in this email just for Dark Sakura.

2144
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Well joke's on you.

2145
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I read the email tonight.

2146
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:39,000
It looks like it was made by someone named Anastasia Shostakova.

2147
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Hmm.

2148
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
So.

2149
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Yeah I'm going to definitely.

2150
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I've seen manga for this I think.

2151
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Yeah.

2152
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Because yeah the design looks way familiar so yeah.

2153
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Alright well it's too bad we didn't hear about that before we were talking about the G4 shows

2154
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
we'd like to see.

2155
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Alright.

2156
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Going to our next email which is from Nutman.

2157
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I just want to give my condolences to Jamie after losing her cat.

2158
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:08,000
My dog I had for 13 years just passed away recently and it was awful.

2159
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:14,000
We think she had a stroke at some point and she may have had many seizures before we could get her to the vet to be put to sleep.

2160
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,000
It was terrible and I wish that they would not have been the last memories I have of her.

2161
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
It sounds like Shermy.

2162
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I butchered the name I'm sure and they did spell it wrong but that's OK they tried.

2163
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Went peacefully during the night though.

2164
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I could never talk about it on air like you so massive kudos to having the courage to do that.

2165
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I think I would tear up.

2166
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Jamie did a very good job last week.

2167
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Thank you.

2168
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I did have a pretty significant sniffle.

2169
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Losing a pet and that was not the sinus infection either.

2170
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Losing a pet is something that only other pet owners can understand.

2171
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I hope you will feel better about this terrible situation soon.

2172
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Happy face.

2173
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Well it's been about a week and a half now.

2174
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:57,000
And it's funny like last night I was walking back to the bedroom to go to bed.

2175
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:03,000
And I saw a shadow at my feet and my brain instantly went to it's Shermy and stepped over the shadow.

2176
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
And I was like wait that's not the cat man.

2177
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:13,000
So yeah it's getting slowly better but I still have problems doing laundry actually because that was Shermy's room.

2178
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:17,000
Well a good excuse to make Dan do the laundry.

2179
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Seriously.

2180
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Alright Redertainment starts this email.

2181
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Trainer.

2182
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Hello Podcrafters.

2183
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Does he have a thing for like Trainer in the Mass Effect games or is this another reference?

2184
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I need to know this.

2185
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Alright Redertainment wants to know hello Podcrafters.

2186
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,000
After seeing Loki's Halloween costume on Twitter.

2187
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Which by the way Loki amazing Halloween costume.

2188
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Have you worn it yet or is that for work?

2189
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Uh it's for work.

2190
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
This question comes to mind.

2191
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,000
What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?

2192
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Mine is the kigurumi I wore last year.

2193
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I might wear it again this year due to it's supreme awesomeness.

2194
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Stay care.

2195
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Redertainment.

2196
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Trainer.

2197
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Sent from my iPad.

2198
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
For the record.

2199
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:59,000
That's um basically the animal pajamas.

2200
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Is what those are.

2201
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Uh what is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?

2202
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:07,000
My weirdest costumes have always been for my actual cosplay.

2203
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Um.

2204
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Uh.

2205
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I don't really think I've done anything weird for Halloween.

2206
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I did go as a pirate wench.

2207
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Which was fun.

2208
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Cause I walked around with a whip and just started smacking on my coworkers.

2209
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Well and Halloween's about being slutty.

2210
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
No it wasn't slutty at all.

2211
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
It was just you know the bodice.

2212
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
That was about as slutty as it got.

2213
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,000
But it was a long skirt and big boots and a whip and my hat.

2214
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Uh.

2215
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
I tried one time to wear.

2216
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I was gonna wear my bike in costume one year.

2217
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:49,000
But that would have just been cold.

2218
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Alright uh let's see.

2219
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Going to the next email.

2220
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Oh I'm sorry I want to answer the question too.

2221
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
The weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween.

2222
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
When I was in 8th grade I dressed as a bag lady.

2223
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
And I got sent to the principal's office because I hit a kid with my purse.

2224
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
But he had it coming.

2225
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
He was an asshole.

2226
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
He was one of those 8th grade bullies.

2227
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
And he dared to make a comment about my costume.

2228
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
And so I thwacked him with my purse.

2229
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Like a bag lady would do. Right?

2230
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,000
He deserved it.

2231
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,000
What are you? Oh you're sending one from.

2232
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Oh an email?

2233
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Oh okay.

2234
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Except I'm like full up on messages right now.

2235
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
So look at that.

2236
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Cause I gotta count the votes still.

2237
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Oh okay.

2238
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Sorry talking behind the scenes. No one could hear any of that anyway.

2239
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Jeez.

2240
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Alright one more email from Flaco Jones.

2241
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
He always emails Horde House.

2242
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
So I'm very happy to hear him crossing over here.

2243
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Flaco Jones. Hey OLR.

2244
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
I haven't heard anyone else on the show bring it up.

2245
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
And it's getting close to Halloween.

2246
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
So I thought I'd write in and get my review for

2247
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Silent Hill the Haunted House or Maze

2248
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
as they call it at Universal Studios.

2249
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I am glad to hear about this.

2250
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Someone mentioned that to me by the way.

2251
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Having seen it. Maybe Extover?

2252
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Cause he saw it. I don't think it was Extover.

2253
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
I think it was somebody else. But yeah.

2254
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Well anyhow. Since we didn't pony up the money for the front of the line

2255
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
VIP passes. Huge mistake by the way.

2256
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
We were only able to try a couple of the mazes.

2257
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
But the Welcome to Silent Hill maze

2258
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
was by far the best.

2259
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
While it was there to mostly promote

2260
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
the new movie coming out. I really hope it makes

2261
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
a return next year because we will book a trip

2262
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
to experience it again in a heartbeat.

2263
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Despite the movie promotion angle

2264
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
it also contained elements of almost all of the

2265
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Silent Hill games. Save Shattered Memories

2266
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
thank goodness. Like Lisa

2267
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
from Silent Hill 1. All the way to

2268
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
the Boogeyman Executioner from Silent Hill Downpour.

2269
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
It also featured appearances

2270
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
from the nurses and Robbie Bunny as well

2271
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
as Pyramid Head popping up multiple times

2272
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
to chase us to the next room. In fact

2273
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
once we were out and thought we were safe

2274
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
he made one final appearance and chased

2275
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
my wife all the way out to the actual exit

2276
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
of the attraction. She was extremely

2277
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
frightened being a huge fan of the games

2278
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
and finally getting to see some of these monsters

2279
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
in person. They also did a great

2280
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
job nailing the ambiance of Silent Hill

2281
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
with the siren off in the distance

2282
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
as we made our way through the line to the

2283
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
flashlights and radio static inside the maze

2284
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
itself. It was a great time and they did

2285
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
a fantastic job. It better be there

2286
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
next year because we can't wait to go back.

2287
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Happy Halloween Flaco Jones.

2288
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Well bad news for Flaco Jones

2289
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
the movie came in 6th place

2290
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
at the box office this week.

2291
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Not looking good for any

2292
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
long term memory but then again if they

2293
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
invested all that money in it

2294
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
who knows maybe they will bring it back again

2295
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
next year. That does it for emails

2296
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
for tonight. Mailbag at

2297
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your

2298
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
emails for a future

2299
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
week.

2300
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Meanwhile it's time to get to the FUs

2301
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
of the week.

2302
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:55,000
FU to my sinus infection.

2303
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
I really hate it.

2304
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I hate my voice going.

2305
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
And then my really

2306
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
uneven haircut.

2307
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I mean I like having short

2308
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
hair but it wasn't stacked

2309
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
quite right so it's a little uneven in the back.

2310
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Yeah I think that's it.

2311
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Oh and origin.

2312
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
EA.

2313
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Loki.

2314
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
FU to my weekly headache.

2315
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Oh you have a headache again?

2316
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Yep I get them every Sunday.

2317
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I don't know where it's from.

2318
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Sorry to hear it. Maybe I stay up too late.

2319
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Maybe you're allergic to this show.

2320
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
No it's before I get to the show so

2321
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
it's not even an answer to the show

2322
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
it's just get a headache.

2323
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Um an FU to not having enough hours

2324
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
in the day because like I'm really like

2325
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
we have not had time to go to the grocery store today.

2326
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
We've been doing so much but

2327
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
that's alright.

2328
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I shouldn't complain about anything.

2329
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Yeah you were running around when I got here.

2330
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I took a 15 minute nap.

2331
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
And then I was like where are Loki's stories?

2332
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
But it all worked out.

2333
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
In fact Loki has

2334
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
another story for us before we get to the skype line

2335
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
at 1877 game OLR

2336
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
or our username on skype orangeloungeradio

2337
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
just yet we'll let you know when here in

2338
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
a moment. But meanwhile uh

2339
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Loki. Yes apparently the

2340
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Urban Outfitters is selling unlicensed

2341
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
stuff to the product. Oh my goodness!

2342
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
What?

2343
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
How dare they not

2344
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
license stuff to sell?

2345
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
And all this like really random stuff

2346
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
I mean considering the Urban Outfitters is basically

2347
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
like apparel.

2348
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
I mean it's kind of not really

2349
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
something that I would see them selling.

2350
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
But like they're trying to sell Nintendo 64

2351
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
controllers USB Nintendo

2352
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
or Super Nintendo controllers and

2353
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
like

2354
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
the Supaboy

2355
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
portable game console and one of those knock

2356
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
off Super Nintendo things.

2357
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I don't know.

2358
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Not really sure why this is news but

2359
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
we're talking about it.

2360
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Well cause it's knock off shit

2361
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
and it's um at a

2362
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
major store you know. I don't know.

2363
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
So everybody sells those stupid knock off game

2364
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
you know

2365
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Super Nintendo Genesis things. I mean all

2366
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
like the indie game stores sell them.

2367
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
And Urban Outfitters

2368
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
that's just weird. That just seems

2369
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
like Sears

2370
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
selling something like that. I mean

2371
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
it's just like who gives a shit

2372
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
that they're selling that.

2373
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Well I'm

2374
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
gonna go run to Urban Outfitters right now after

2375
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
the show and check that out.

2376
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

2377
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Alright I got a story

2378
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
for you guys here. It's about a

2379
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
favorite game of mine getting an MMO.

2380
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
But there's a twist to it.

2381
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Isn't there always? It's a Civilization

2382
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
MMO. Yep. Civilization Online

2383
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
MMO. It's gonna be available

2384
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
soon in Asia.

2385
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Yep. Fire Access

2386
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
is working with XL Games

2387
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
a Korean studio that did the game

2388
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Lineage. You might have heard of that game. It's like the biggest

2389
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
MMO in the world. Yes. Bigger than Warcraft.

2390
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
They're gonna create Civilization

2391
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Online. It is an online only

2392
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
game. It's gonna be in Asian markets

2393
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
soon. Yeah.

2394
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
They're doing Civilization Online. They don't say a whole

2395
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
lot else about it. Just otherwise the partnership

2396
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
there. Not a lot of news about

2397
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
what is gonna be in the game or anything

2398
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
like that. But it's a

2399
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
little weird to me because Civ V

2400
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
you can already play online.

2401
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
So how does an MMO work?

2402
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Does it like never stop? Is it

2403
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
like an endless world that you

2404
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
can always explore? There's

2405
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
more things about this I'd like to know. And the other one

2406
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
is why won't we get a version

2407
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
in the US? Maybe

2408
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
E3 they'll announce some type of partnership

2409
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
to publish it here locally. I hope so.

2410
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Cause I'd like to be able to try this you know.

2411
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Alright

2412
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
that's gonna do it for the news tonight

2413
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
which means it is time to open up

2414
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
the Skype line. 1877 Game

2415
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
OLR. Our username on Skype

2416
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
is OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a call.

2417
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
We'll talk about whatever you

2418
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
want to talk about in the news tonight. Or

2419
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
maybe something else. In the

2420
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
meantime we'll get to Twitter topics at Twitter.com

2421
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
slash OLR or

2422
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Loki. I don't know if there's anything

2423
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
you want to add here for last minute stories while we

2424
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
wait for some calls. Apparently GameStop's opening

2425
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
GameStop kids stores.

2426
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Oh I saw that. Alan posted that link to the

2427
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
OrangeLoungeRadio Facebook page. Tell us a little

2428
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
more about this. 80 locations are gonna

2429
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
specialize in E-rated games

2430
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
and it's Evil G Junior.

2431
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I don't know.

2432
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
It's like a mall

2433
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
type store.

2434
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Alright we have a call coming in. Let's go to the phones.

2435
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2436
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Hey how you doing? It's Bobby.

2437
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Hey Bobby. Good to hear from you. What's up buddy?

2438
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Nothing much. You guys were talking a lot

2439
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
about G4 earlier. Yes we were.

2440
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
In fact we dedicated a whole segment

2441
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
of our show to it tonight.

2442
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
And I didn't dedicate anything.

2443
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I know. What's up with that?

2444
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I'm a little conflicted just because

2445
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
of my past and stuff with G4

2446
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
and I'm trying to figure out

2447
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
how I want to say what I want to say.

2448
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Okay well for those that don't know

2449
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
tell us a little bit about what the past

2450
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
is for you. Okay so

2451
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
for those that

2452
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
don't, well I mean obviously we came

2453
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
from All Games

2454
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
and Scott Rubin but I had met Scott Rubin

2455
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
a long time before then.

2456
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I met him in 97.

2457
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
And he was one of the people that started

2458
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
G4 after his

2459
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
first incarnation of All Games went away in the

2460
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
dot com bust. So I

2461
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
was pretty much right there

2462
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
at the formation and creation

2463
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
of G4 as an outsider, as a

2464
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
volunteer.

2465
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Back before

2466
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
back when we just knew it was

2467
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
something that a Disney guy

2468
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
was going to be starting with Comcast.

2469
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
And that's all we knew about it.

2470
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
So I was there

2471
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
when they launched the site in April

2472
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
of 2002 and the network

2473
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
didn't go on the air until for a couple months later

2474
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I think. And so

2475
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I was there and I actually was

2476
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
the first forum moderator over the G4 forums.

2477
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I ran the chat room for

2478
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
about two years. I was on

2479
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
the majority of the shows that were on

2480
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
G4 at some point.

2481
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I actually have a VHS tape that's like 30 minutes

2482
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
long of every single time I was either mentioned or shown.

2483
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I never realized that you were actually

2484
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
on the network at some point. I never realized that.

2485
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
I was. As I was the

2486
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
for some of the shows I was

2487
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
like the backup caller.

2488
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Cause they had a talk show G4tv.com

2489
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
which was hosted by Scott Rubin and

2490
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Laura Foy and Tina Wood.

2491
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
And they taped

2492
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
they would do a live stream of their taping but since

2493
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
it was a TV show it was like a five hour taping.

2494
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
And so we were all kind of in the audience.

2495
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
And they would take calls.

2496
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
And sometimes I would be the one who would call in

2497
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
and I'd work out with the producer what

2498
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
I talk about. Or I would be

2499
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
the backup if the guy that they

2500
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
wanted to call in flaked out.

2501
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
And so I would have to make up stuff

2502
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
about games I've never played.

2503
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
And act as a caller. Like there was one about Splinter Cell

2504
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
and you know me I would never play Splinter Cell.

2505
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Right. But I actually called into the show

2506
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
once as if you know it was still me.

2507
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
I mean I wasn't playing a character or anything.

2508
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Talking about Splinter Cell.

2509
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
It's really funny. I do want to

2510
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
make a minor correction to something you said. Cause you

2511
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
said we came from all games. Which you know

2512
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
that was our previous home

2513
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
prior to this. But you know

2514
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
we had started elsewhere before.

2515
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
So we were around on our own Live 365

2516
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
thing when G4 started. So

2517
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
we were those viewers out there that was kind of

2518
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
a little critical and cynical of what was going on

2519
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
on G4 television. But admittedly

2520
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
I was also

2521
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
critical and cynical cause I left.

2522
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
You know and it was

2523
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
basically I mean everybody. And it's kind of funny

2524
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
because my version of G4 is different from

2525
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
other people's version of G4. Because

2526
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I stopped my

2527
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
involvement with G4 about the same time Scott

2528
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
did which was after the tech. Right after the tech TV

2529
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
merger. Because I didn't like the way they handled

2530
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
it. And to a lot of people when they say

2531
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
oh G4 they think the screen savers.

2532
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
They think call for help. They think X-Play.

2533
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
That wasn't G4.

2534
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
That was tech TV.

2535
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
You know the G4 that I remember was

2536
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
mostly you know like

2537
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
G4tv.com and Icons and

2538
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Cinematech and Pulse and Portal and

2539
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
and all these games. Arena

2540
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
and all those

2541
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
and they were

2542
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
they had some great ideas. The execution was lacking

2543
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
just because of budget. But they didn't give

2544
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
them a chance to actually get the budget.

2545
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
For any of those shows.

2546
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Huh.

2547
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
I remember Pringles Presents

2548
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Yeah. That was cheat.

2549
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Pringles presented cheat. But what was interesting

2550
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
is because I actually did get to meet

2551
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
most of the hosts from the 2002 to

2552
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
2004 including the illustrious

2553
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Will Wheaton. And they all kind of

2554
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
knew who I was. Just through

2555
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
the forum posts and stuff because they interacted

2556
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
some and I would be the liaison sometimes.

2557
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
And a lot of them

2558
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
a lot of the hosts actually did know what they were

2559
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
talking about with video games. Which was the main complaint

2560
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
everybody had about the original G4 host.

2561
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Is that they didn't know what they were talking about. They were just

2562
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
reading a teleprompter. Two or three

2563
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
of them were reading teleprompter and didn't

2564
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
know. But I could actually have

2565
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
intelligent conversations with the majority of the hosts

2566
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
of all the G4 shows about

2567
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
video games. And that's one thing a lot

2568
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
of people didn't realize back

2569
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
before the merger.

2570
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Why do you think people didn't get that?

2571
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Why do you think that got lost in translation?

2572
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Was that over production? Was that

2573
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
you know and I see

2574
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
TigerClaus in our chat says the G4

2575
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
TV.com show was heavily scripted.

2576
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
The callers couldn't call in and call about whatever

2577
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
they wanted. Is that because maybe they took some of the

2578
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
organicness about it out of it?

2579
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Yes because they it was

2580
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
basically it was a video game channel being made

2581
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
by cable television executives.

2582
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
So they followed the

2583
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
cable television model. They didn't know that much about

2584
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
video games. They just they thought

2585
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
they knew the way to do it and

2586
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
that's one of the reasons Scott Rubin left was

2587
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
because he couldn't get into their head

2588
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
that they were doing it all wrong.

2589
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
And they didn't listen to him because all he had done is web

2590
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
stuff. He didn't know how cable industry

2591
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
worked. Well right in some ways

2592
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
the original G4

2593
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
was kind of like an extension of the

2594
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
first era of all games right?

2595
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Yeah and I mean that's why they brought a

2596
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
bunch of people from the original all games.

2597
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
There were four people from the original

2598
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
all games network that they brought over

2599
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
flew to move from New York to California

2600
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
with Scott Rubin.

2601
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Laura Foy was from the original all games.

2602
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
With a lot of the other the non-gaming shows

2603
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
at pseudo like High Weirdness and stuff with

2604
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Judge Cal. But Josh Crane

2605
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
and Jim Downs also worked with

2606
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
the with pseudo in the all games network

2607
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
and they became Josh Crane became

2608
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
an executive at G4. He's no

2609
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
longer with them and Jim Downs was a producer

2610
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
who was also no longer with the network.

2611
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
So you know none of them

2612
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
are with the network anymore. But there

2613
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
were some people that are still there

2614
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
and I don't know if they're still going to be with the network after

2615
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
the change or what because they kind of did

2616
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
more generic stuff with the TV network.

2617
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I was going to say is there anybody still at G4

2618
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
that was there at the very beginning?

2619
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Yes there was one guy his name

2620
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Derek I'm not going to give his last name but people who

2621
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
probably from the all games era know who I'm talking about

2622
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
he is still there. And

2623
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
he's the only one I really know of that is still there.

2624
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Wow.

2625
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
And he was also kind of from that

2626
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
pseudo online. He might have been

2627
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I don't know if he was flown from New York but I know he was one of

2628
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Scott's friends. So let me ask this

2629
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
I mean you know obviously this news

2630
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
has you a little conflicted because it is kind of rough

2631
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
to see the last remnants of

2632
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
G4 disappearing but these

2633
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
shows were tech TV

2634
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
shows that are the last

2635
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
didn't this all kind of already end five years ago?

2636
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
I think it all well

2637
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
G4 to me ended in 2004.

2638
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
You know and I liked tech TV

2639
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
too. I watched both networks. I watched the screen

2640
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
savers every day on tech TV.

2641
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
And the reason G4 bought you know

2642
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
well the reason I'll kind of expand

2643
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
because you read some of my comments. Basically

2644
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Paul Allen who was one of the VP's of Microsoft

2645
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
he bought a lot of things and he's the

2646
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
guy that started tech TV because he wanted a

2647
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
cable television network

2648
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
about technology. He got bored with it.

2649
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
And said

2650
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
you know I know you guys are about to pull a profit and pull

2651
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
high ratings you know tech TV was on the rise.

2652
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
He's like but I'm bored. And

2653
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Comcast is offering money so I want it. And Comcast

2654
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
wanted tech TV because G4

2655
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
could not get on direct TV.

2656
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
They couldn't. Direct TV rejected

2657
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
them. Said that we don't want your content.

2658
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Tech TV was already on

2659
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
direct TV so

2660
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
that was their Trojan horse

2661
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
and so they became G4 tech TV

2662
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
and this is why they actually did that

2663
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
because they could not change the type

2664
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
of network until they renegotiated the contract

2665
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
with direct TV. So

2666
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
in order to be broadcast on tech

2667
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
TV signal they had to retain

2668
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
tech TV's

2669
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
type of content. And that's

2670
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
why they kept the screen savers and kept

2671
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
some of the other tech TV type stuff

2672
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
and became G4 tech TV

2673
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
and then once they renegotiated the contract

2674
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
they went back to G4.

2675
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Interesting.

2676
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
And it's

2677
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
funny I told you I was going to tell this story

2678
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
in chat about

2679
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
one of my most famous

2680
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
acts

2681
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
one of the acts that has shaped cable

2682
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
television that I did

2683
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
or at least I claimed to do.

2684
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
And when I say this story I realized that

2685
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
at the time I believed

2686
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
this was true and

2687
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
to his credit the

2688
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
other person played along and told me it was

2689
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
true but looking back I'm pretty

2690
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
sure that my version of events is a little bit

2691
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
different than the actual history

2692
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
but basically back in like

2693
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
2003 or whatever

2694
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Scott was trying to fight the director

2695
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
of G4tv.com

2696
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
trying to get him to do some more

2697
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
hardcore gaming segments that the director who didn't

2698
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
know anything about video games he knew about cable TV

2699
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
didn't want to do. And so he really

2700
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
wanted to hire a production assistant

2701
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
to kind of give

2702
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
him help him get leverage over the director

2703
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
so now it's two voices instead of just one

2704
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
because G4tv.com really

2705
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
devolved into what

2706
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
can we make Laura Foy and Tina Wood do

2707
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
to appease the teenager

2708
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
male demographic.

2709
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
And that's why they did the

2710
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
challenges that had the

2711
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
gross

2712
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
ending to it or whatever

2713
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
you know the humiliation at the end.

2714
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
And

2715
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
in comes chat one day is

2716
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
somebody that I kind of remember from the old

2717
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
pseudo days from Shooters which is one of the old

2718
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
all games network shows. Captain Emmie

2719
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
and he was sitting there

2720
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
talking about how he didn't like

2721
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
where he was. He was working at some public access

2722
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
station or some real low TV station

2723
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
and I knew Scott was working for

2724
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
a production assistant

2725
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
but Scott actually told me

2726
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
he didn't want me to come out for it because I wouldn't

2727
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
get paid enough. But I

2728
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
told Captain Emmie that

2729
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
hey Scott's looking for this guy

2730
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
for a production assistant. He's like

2731
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
oh no I couldn't ask him for that. I'm like no really

2732
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
he's looking for

2733
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
somebody to fill the job.

2734
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
And Scott comes into chat and I'm like

2735
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
hey Scott Captain Emmie's looking for a job

2736
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
and it was oh really.

2737
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
And

2738
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
to kind of

2739
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
tie the story together Captain Emmie was the

2740
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
screen name for Kevin Pereira.

2741
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
So I

2742
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
believed for the longest time and to Kevin's credit

2743
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
he agreed with me that I got him

2744
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
his job at G4.

2745
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Now the real version is more

2746
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
like Kevin knew the job was open

2747
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
he was coming into chat just to see when Scott was

2748
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
around to talk to him about it. But he

2749
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
you know he'll

2750
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
play along and say that I kind of

2751
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
pointed him in the direction when I think that was the direction

2752
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
he was going in anyway. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

2753
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
So

2754
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
yeah in some

2755
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
ways you can blame me for Kevin even being hired

2756
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
at G4 in the first place.

2757
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Or maybe thank you in the case of Alan

2758
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
and what he said during the list list segment tonight.

2759
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
So there you go.

2760
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
But

2761
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I mean the shows I liked on G4

2762
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
the most were actually not produced by G4.

2763
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Electric Playground and

2764
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Judgment Day were from Greedy Productions. They're still

2765
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
in business. Electric Playground is actually the

2766
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
longest running television show about

2767
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
video games in the world. It's been

2768
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
running since 1995.

2769
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
And they actually recently went daily

2770
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
but they're mainly Canadian.

2771
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
They're produced up in Vancouver and

2772
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Judgment Day is actually just a re-skinning of

2773
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
their show Reviews on the Run. G4

2774
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
wanted something specific and

2775
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
so they took the Reviews on the Run footage

2776
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
that had Victor Lucas and Tommy Tallarico

2777
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
and put G4 graphics around it.

2778
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
And that's all they did. So in Canada it was Reviews

2779
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
on the Run. Here it was Judgment Day.

2780
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
They still do Reviews on the Run and what's funny is

2781
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Tommy Tallarico no longer

2782
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
does any of that stuff because he's so busy with video games live.

2783
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
But one of the

2784
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
people that does Reviews on Reviews on the Run

2785
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
was kind of like me in

2786
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
the same sense that we were in the G4

2787
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
forums together and

2788
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
kind of attached to specific shows

2789
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
and personalities. I attach to Scott Rubin. I do

2790
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
podcasts. This guy

2791
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Jose Sanchez, he went by Fubar,

2792
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
attached himself to Victor Lucas and

2793
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
he now is one of the hosts on Reviews on the Run. He was

2794
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
a production assistant there for Greedy

2795
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
for the longest time and worked his way up.

2796
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Wow. That's awesome.

2797
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Huh.

2798
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Well, it's been story time with

2799
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Bobby Blackwolf but this is good.

2800
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
It's kind of neat to hear the history and I hope you do

2801
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
end up doing your piece for VOG Network

2802
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
about kind of reflecting on it.

2803
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Gosh, I'm

2804
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
trying to think what else to ask you with this thing but

2805
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
do you think there is a future

2806
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
for video game

2807
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
television? Do you think

2808
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
somebody else we don't know of

2809
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
yet could come in and start a video game

2810
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
network or is it just, you know what, no

2811
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
video game stuff is always going to be on the internet.

2812
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
This is something always internet based.

2813
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
There's only one way

2814
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
I think and

2815
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
it's going to, basically I'm looking to

2816
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Korea. The only way that we can

2817
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
get a video game channel is if

2818
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
esports takes off in America the way it's taken off

2819
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
in Korea. That's the

2820
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
only way I think it'll happen. I don't think we're going to see

2821
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
a generic video game network like

2822
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
G4 and I mean G4

2823
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
tried a whole bunch of different things. They didn't have

2824
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
all new shows. They had one show that was a scripted

2825
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
show and it was about

2826
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
and took place in MMOs. It was an early

2827
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
machinima show using a

2828
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
whole bunch of different MMOs to tell this overarching

2829
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
story. It was Portal and

2830
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
they tried stuff like that

2831
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
and it didn't really

2832
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
take off and

2833
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I don't think anybody has the patience to make

2834
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
that take off but I think

2835
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
with esports, I think

2836
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
if esports does take off, if League of

2837
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Legends takes off or Starcraft or something

2838
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
we don't know about yet, we may

2839
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
be able to get a dedicated esports

2840
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
channel but that's probably

2841
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
as close as we're going to be able to get.

2842
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
I would see it probably ending up more

2843
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
being an esports show

2844
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
on the Ocho or something

2845
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
along those lines but

2846
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I don't know.

2847
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
I'd like to be able to see

2848
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
something and hopefully it will be

2849
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
less corporate

2850
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
controlled. I mean I know that's just

2851
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
looking at it through such

2852
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
dream pie in the sky ideals

2853
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
but yeah

2854
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
it sounds like a lot of the crap that happened

2855
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
on both G4 and TechTV were just

2856
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
bad executive decisions.

2857
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
But

2858
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
and I'm going to point this out, Leo Laporte

2859
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
tweeted this week, Attack of the show

2860
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
in X-Play on G4 lasted 8 years

2861
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
that was longer than any show on TechTV.

2862
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
That's true.

2863
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Because TechTV

2864
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
started in I think 1999

2865
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
and they were off the air in 2004.

2866
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
Good point.

2867
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Alright well Bobby, before

2868
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
we let you go to take more calls, do you have anything else you want to share

2869
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
with our listeners tonight?

2870
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I've been doing a lot of interviews lately.

2871
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
And they've been pretty good.

2872
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
And I've got a big

2873
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
interview show next week. I'm not live.

2874
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
But I've got some

2875
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
big interviews. Hotline Miami which is a new

2876
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
indie game that everybody is loving right now.

2877
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
And then

2878
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
MechWarrior Online and Fallen

2879
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Enchantress. All those interviews next week.

2880
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
I interviewed a local studio

2881
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
about their first person

2882
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
magic game this week, earlier tonight.

2883
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
They're Xavian and actually

2884
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
a lot of their developers were in chat.

2885
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
And I've already gotten an email

2886
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
from them thanking me for it and

2887
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
telling me that it sounds like one of the quotes I said

2888
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
may be on the back of the box in two years.

2889
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Which would be awesome.

2890
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Unfortunately I wasn't the one that

2891
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
initially said the quote Dungeon Buster did so I don't know how this

2892
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
works.

2893
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
But they specific because it's a first person

2894
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
magic game and Dungeon Buster

2895
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
in chat was like...

2896
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
It's like Skyrim's magic system done right

2897
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
and I repeated that and that's what they

2898
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
quoted in the interview that they really appreciated hearing.

2899
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Interesting.

2900
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Alright we'll see what happens.

2901
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Well yeah if you're not already tuning in

2902
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
an hour early at vognetwork.com

2903
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
before OLR you're missing out on a great...

2904
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Bobby's having a great year. I mean not

2905
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
that the other seven sucked but you're having a

2906
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
great year. But I still

2907
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
got snubbed.

2908
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Don't go there.

2909
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
Did you look at the

2910
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
list of who got nominated? It's a lot of

2911
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
corp stuff. It's unfortunately...

2912
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
And I think the corporate stuff gets nominated

2913
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
because people want to make a complete ballot

2914
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
and they don't know who else to nominate.

2915
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Yeah.

2916
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
There you go.

2917
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Bobby you definitely earned

2918
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
a place in our hearts.

2919
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Thank you.

2920
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Alright well Bobby I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.

2921
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Have a good one buddy. You too.

2922
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
That was fun reminiscing with

2923
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Bobby. We have another call coming

2924
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
right in though so let's get to the phones.

2925
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

2926
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Greetings Ronald Roberts.

2927
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
This is DJ Ron Ness live from the

2928
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Brooklyn Studios of anime jam session.

2929
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
Oh my gosh.

2930
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I thought I heard wind in the background there.

2931
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Is the storm rolling in?

2932
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Are you getting blown by Sandy right now?

2933
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
It's raining sideways!

2934
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
What?

2935
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
It's raining sideways!

2936
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
It's go rain!

2937
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
It's go rain!

2938
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Yes yes yes.

2939
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Right now

2940
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
I'm going to tell you the same thing

2941
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I told Travis and Jessica

2942
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
last August when Irene

2943
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
reared her little head up in here.

2944
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
What's that?

2945
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
It's windy as hell.

2946
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
It's a little bit of rain.

2947
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
The shoreline

2948
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
of Jersey has been more or less

2949
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
flooded out but this Jersey no one

2950
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
cares. The

2951
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
anime jam session studios are in

2952
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
zone B which means

2953
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
we do not have to go anywhere.

2954
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
We're also on the second floor which means

2955
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
we don't have to worry about being flooded out.

2956
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
And we have enough battery backups here

2957
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
so if the power does go out

2958
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
we will have internet for another eight hours.

2959
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
It's the important

2960
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
things in life.

2961
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Alright I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about the

2962
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
hurricane though. What did you really want to talk about?

2963
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Well

2964
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
there was something else that we

2965
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
did as part of my

2966
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
podcast on Friday.

2967
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
We went to an event in lower

2968
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Manhattan called Girl Gamers

2969
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Meet Up New York City.

2970
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
But you're not a girl.

2971
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
No but

2972
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
some of my staffers are.

2973
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
He's meeting up with a lot of the girls.

2974
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
You just went to go get some phone

2975
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
numbers. No I'm kidding I'm kidding.

2976
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
That sounds fun.

2977
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
We'll save that for another time.

2978
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Nice.

2979
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Why thank you.

2980
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
But pretty much

2981
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
the point of the Meet Up

2982
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
was to get more girls involved

2983
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
into playing video games to prove that

2984
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
it's not just boys

2985
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
and men that are playing. Girls and women play

2986
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
video games and they can kick as much ass

2987
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
as their counterparts.

2988
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Absolutely. Right DarkSagra?

2989
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Right. She said right

2990
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
but you can't hear her anymore.

2991
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
I'm sorry everything's just exploding because the Giants

2992
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
apparently won. Oh.

2993
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Is that their fourth game? Yeah.

2994
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Oh boy. That's it then.

2995
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
I'm so glad I didn't go to

2996
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
San Francisco this weekend. I am so

2997
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
glad.

2998
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
To quote Renee

2999
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
and sorry for taking over

3000
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Ronchon. No that's okay.

3001
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
The city in which I reside has erupted

3002
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
in cowbell car alarm and hollering.

3003
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Either the Giants won or this is

3004
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
a prequel to some Satan pagan worship before

3005
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Halloween.

3006
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Well

3007
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
given that I am

3008
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
a boy and brand new yorker

3009
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
trust me when we feel the

3010
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
pain of not being there and

3011
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
whereas there are the mixed fans that are like

3012
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
well this was really going to happen.

3013
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Nice. Alright so

3014
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
sorry to derail but what else did you

3015
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
get done at the con? No problem.

3016
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Well what we did was we

3017
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
got a chance to interview

3018
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Jen Vargas the founder

3019
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
and creator of Girl Gamer Vogue.

3020
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
The point of her creating this

3021
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
is to prove that girls

3022
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
are just as good as gamers as guys

3023
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
and to break the stereotype

3024
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
and prove that there is a difference between

3025
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
girl gamers and gamer girls.

3026
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
You know the type of girls who sit there

3027
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
and they kind of look sexy with a controller

3028
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
and you know

3029
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
they don't like that.

3030
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Well you still there?

3031
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I'm still here can you hear me good sir?

3032
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Yes I can. What was that last part you said?

3033
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I said the last part was

3034
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
about how to try to break the stereotypes

3035
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
and prove there is a difference between

3036
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
girl gamers and gamer girls.

3037
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Ah okay

3038
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
okay so Olivia Munn is not necessarily

3039
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
a representation of gamer girls everywhere

3040
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I get what you mean. Exactly.

3041
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Absolutely. And they had some

3042
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
and they had some gamer girls

3043
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
there too in costume

3044
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
talking about their YouTube channels and how they

3045
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
give tutorials on how to play

3046
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
various games how to get through certain

3047
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
action games and they had a

3048
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
theme they were playing we had

3049
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Gears of War 3 with Zombie Mod

3050
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Left 4 Dead 2

3051
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Gauntlet and Friday the 13th.

3052
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Friday the 13th like the 8 bit

3053
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
NES game?

3054
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Yes. Yes it was. Amazing.

3055
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
So where can we hear these interviews?

3056
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Well we

3057
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
were holding on to them because

3058
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
N.A. Jam session is so ever

3059
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
grateful to Orange Town Radio

3060
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
this interview that we did is exclusive

3061
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
to O.L.R. Oh

3062
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
awesome we're going to play that next week

3063
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
so not only will we have Eddie from

3064
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Money Style with us but we're going to play that interview

3065
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
as well on the show so

3066
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
thank you so much for doing that for us.

3067
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
No problem. When this popped up

3068
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
the first person I thought of was my darling

3069
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Rope Sean. Awwww

3070
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Barf. Hey

3071
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
shut up. I brought you vanilla

3072
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Tootsie Rolls. You did. They're delicious.

3073
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Talk about barf.

3074
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Shut up. Since you are the man behind

3075
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
the anime show and I know you have a whole

3076
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
staff behind you but since

3077
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
you are the guy on the show here representing

3078
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
the anime jam session I've got to ask you

3079
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
I don't know did you hear that email about

3080
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
the anime that's Nintendo

3081
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
and Sega and all that did you hear that

3082
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
email? No

3083
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I did not.

3084
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
We may have to investigate that talk about that

3085
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
on our show coming

3086
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
up on this Thursday. You need to.

3087
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
I'll send you more information. It's available

3088
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
on Crunchyroll apparently for free and it's

3089
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
inspired by

3090
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
old Sega characters apparently.

3091
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Do you remember the name of it?

3092
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
There you go.

3093
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Wow. Very good. Good memory.

3094
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I'm actually looking at the page right now on Wikipedia.

3095
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Fantastic memory.

3096
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
I linked it myself so I would find it.

3097
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
I just linked it on my Facebook.

3098
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Gotcha.

3099
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
I will definitely check that when I go back inside.

3100
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Awesome. Alright well

3101
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Rama be safe. Don't float away.

3102
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
We will. We will.

3103
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
We're good. We have enough battery backup.

3104
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
We have enough alcohol. We are

3105
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
good to go for the next 48 hours.

3106
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Sounds good. Fill the bathtub with water.

3107
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
We can't.

3108
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
We don't have a stopper for the water.

3109
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
We are so cold.

3110
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Oh no. Get every glass

3111
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
in the cupboard and fill it up. Condoms.

3112
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Alright I'm

3113
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
ending this conversation. Bye Rama.

3114
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Be safe.

3115
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
You safe drivers good sir.

3116
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Alright.

3117
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Thank you so much Rama.

3118
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
And thank you to everybody that called in tonight.

3119
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Both our callers. Since both those calls

3120
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
were a little long we're going to wrap it up.

3121
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
I'm sorry. But we still got to do

3122
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
some more last minute stories on our Twitter topics.

3123
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
So we're like not even close to being done yet.

3124
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
We don't want to go for 4 hours tonight.

3125
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
So Loki do you have other last minute stories

3126
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
before I get to the tweets?

3127
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Yeah the John Sisters Twisted Dreams is now available.

3128
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
You can get that on Steam as part of

3129
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
the green light thing.

3130
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I actually have a token for it.

3131
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
You can download it now.

3132
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Zynga is bringing

3133
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Farmville or I should say

3134
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
you know their online stuff

3135
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
into online gambling.

3136
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Apparently they're planning on doing

3137
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
a slot based

3138
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
or slot simulator based on Farmville.

3139
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
And

3140
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
may expand into other

3141
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
online casino or

3142
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
bidding type things.

3143
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Interesting. I think they only have like

3144
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Farmville casino like actual slot

3145
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
machines like real slot machines.

3146
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
I want to say they do have those so

3147
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
not a surprise there.

3148
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
And of course they lost

3149
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
52.7 million dollars in

3150
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Quarter 3. Probably why they had to

3151
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
fire a lot of people or

3152
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
lay off.

3153
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Yeah. I think people are just

3154
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
kind of over those type of games now.

3155
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Although then again I get all these invites for

3156
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Farmville too so maybe not.

3157
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Let me do some quick Twitter topics here.

3158
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
I liked this tweet

3159
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
here and I have to admit I'm not

3160
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
informed on the topic very much

3161
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
but I'll try here.

3162
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Nigella and I hope I said that right.

3163
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Nigella tweeted us.

3164
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Don't know if the Florence Gate saga has made it on

3165
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
your radar. Raises interesting questions

3166
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
about games journalism.

3167
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Now apparently what happened and he links us

3168
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
to something that's on Reddit.

3169
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
And here's the deal.

3170
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
According to what I see on Reddit here

3171
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Robert Florence just

3172
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
stepped down from Eurogamer because of

3173
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
this column yesterday blasting games

3174
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
journalists and their relationship

3175
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
to PR. And he

3176
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
links to a tweet from the author that says

3177
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
yesterday was my last piece for

3178
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Eurogamer. Here it is in amended form.

3179
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
I stand by every word of the

3180
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
original piece. And I

3181
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
remember reading this original piece.

3182
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Somebody linked it to me because it was

3183
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
all around Twitter and I'm like why are all these

3184
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
people joking about Doritos and Mountain Dew? Somebody fill

3185
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
me in. And I remember reading

3186
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
this original piece. Now

3187
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I'm not sure I understand

3188
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
why this was

3189
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
so

3190
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
flipping terrible. Although I notice

3191
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
there is an editor's note

3192
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
following receipt of a complaint from

3193
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Lauren Wainwright. Eurogamer

3194
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
has removed part of this article.

3195
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
But without any admission of

3196
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
without admission of any liability.

3197
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Eurogamer apologizes for any distress

3198
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
caused to Miss Wainwright by the references to her.

3199
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
This article otherwise remains

3200
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
as originally published. Now

3201
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
because I don't have a photographic

3202
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
memory. I don't know what that means

3203
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
was cut from the article. My

3204
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
assumption bolded

3205
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
italicized underlined

3206
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
was that it probably had to do with a

3207
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
particular PR

3208
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
rep or PR firm that

3209
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
was kind of doing

3210
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
some things that might be considered questionable.

3211
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
And you know the whole thing is about

3212
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
basically

3213
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
how tight of a hold

3214
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
does PR have on games journalism?

3215
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
How do you spell her last name?

3216
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Right there.

3217
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Son of a bitch.

3218
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
I hit the button on my iPad that takes me

3219
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
back to start. Hold on.

3220
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Son of a bitch. Alright there it is right there. There's the name for you.

3221
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Can I zoom in on that? No.

3222
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Because this iPad is so exciting.

3223
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
So there you go.

3224
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I'm looking for the

3225
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
Black Wolf says he quoted the

3226
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
public Twitter of Lauren Wainwright.

3227
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Her outlet threatened

3228
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
libel which is nasty in UK

3229
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
libel laws. They quoted

3230
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
her public Twitter about how she was

3231
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
OK with promoting hashtags

3232
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
to win a Playstation 3

3233
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
and then talked about how she was promoting

3234
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Tomb Raider and then uncovered

3235
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
that she actually works as a freelancer

3236
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
for Square Enix. Do I need to

3237
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
call back in? Maybe. You have

3238
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
a better memory than I sir because I remember

3239
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
looking at the original article and I was like

3240
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
yeah I could have told you that for a long time

3241
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
now basically.

3242
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
You know PR has its grip

3243
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
firmly on hold of a lot of games journalism.

3244
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
That's why I've always said

3245
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Indies are the best because

3246
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
even though not everybody

3247
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
you know is um

3248
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
some of these indie gamers are probably the first ones

3249
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
to do the or indie folks are probably

3250
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
the first ones to do these hashtags to try

3251
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
and win a Playstation 3.

3252
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
A lot of times that's where the most honesty

3253
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
is going to come from as well.

3254
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Thank you Bobby for setting us straight.

3255
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
That kind of sucks that it cost this guy

3256
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
his job though.

3257
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
There's a quote from Forbes by the way.

3258
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Go join Polygon.

3259
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
That's

3260
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
they sound like a group. They're like a

3261
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Voltron of game people.

3262
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
That's where you need to be buddy.

3263
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
Apparently

3264
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
uh wow

3265
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
alright

3266
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
she has okay since then

3267
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Lauren Wainwright has had personal verbal attacks

3268
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
sent to her Twitter which she has now locked

3269
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
her Steam account and other

3270
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
networking sites. Well now that's crossing

3271
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
the line ridiculousness.

3272
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
This is coming from other people.

3273
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
This was actually on

3274
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Reddit. This is where I'm finding this.

3275
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
I'm just going to read a little bit of it if you don't mind.

3276
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
Robert Florence wrote an article

3277
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
calling out unprofessional behavior in gaming journalism.

3278
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
He then steps down from his job

3279
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
at Eurogamer. That's so he quit.

3280
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
He wasn't fired.

3281
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Because of this article as he was told he would

3282
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
be sued for libel against

3283
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Lauren Wainwright since in the uncensored

3284
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
version he outed her for questionable behavior

3285
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
since then she's had

3286
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
personal attacks sent to her Twitter

3287
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
her Steam account and other networking sites.

3288
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
The Forbes article states it only takes a few bad

3289
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
apples to turn a conversation about free speech

3290
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
and journalism into one about misogyny.

3291
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
So apparently people have been taking this

3292
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
really seriously.

3293
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
He was calling out integrity

3294
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
and people were turning it around as an attack.

3295
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Black Wolf says

3296
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Ben Kucera did a great article about

3297
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
this whole thing on Penny Arcade Report.

3298
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
That doesn't surprise me at all. He's pretty good

3299
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
about taking these situations and

3300
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
putting them into perspective.

3301
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
I have to

3302
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
admit again the core issue

3303
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
we've all

3304
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
known about that for a very long time

3305
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
but this whole fallout and

3306
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
especially now that part where people were like

3307
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
threatening her on Twitter and shit

3308
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
that's

3309
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
that's stupid and that's unfortunate.

3310
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
What else can I say?

3311
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Let's see if anybody's published the unedited.

3312
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Alright.

3313
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Well anyway

3314
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
let me get to some more of these tweets here.

3315
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Surtur tweeted us and said

3316
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
I love Bobby Black Wolf and

3317
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
OLR so much and VOG Network.

3318
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Well we love you too.

3319
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Dark Sakura sends

3320
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
kisses.

3321
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Snotty ones.

3322
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Let's see.

3323
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
SSJ100Matt tweeted us and said hey folks

3324
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
I just want to let you know you guys are keeping

3325
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
me company right now on my three hour drive

3326
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
to Boston. Thank you.

3327
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
You're welcome. Three hour drive?

3328
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
That's a long drive.

3329
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Alright. Let's see.

3330
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Tigerclaw tweets us

3331
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
the Mass Effect movie moves

3332
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
forward with a new screenwriter.

3333
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I know y'all love your Mass Effect

3334
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
especially if your name is Shane or Dark Sakura.

3335
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
So let me read this

3336
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
link here that we got tweeted to

3337
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
from SlashFilm.

3338
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Apparently

3339
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
screenwriter Morgan Davis-Foll

3340
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
has been hired to make a

3341
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
new pass at the script

3342
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
for Mass Effect.

3343
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
This is the first big movement

3344
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
on the project since 2010

3345
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
when Legendary Pictures purchased the right

3346
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
to the franchise.

3347
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
This writer though he has yet to have a

3348
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
script to produce.

3349
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Interesting. But I guess

3350
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
he wrote

3351
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Alien Sleeper Cell and worked on

3352
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Rescue Me as well as some Happy Madison

3353
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
films. Oh god.

3354
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Oh god. That's not sounding good

3355
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
so far. But he's a

3356
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
massive Mass Effect fan

3357
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
and producers liked his take after

3358
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
obviously deciding not to move forward with

3359
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
the original script by Mark

3360
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Protosevich.

3361
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Interesting. Alright well as

3362
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
long as it's more Rescue Me and less

3363
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Happy Madison I'll be alright

3364
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
because he actually is a fan of the games

3365
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
but on behalf of the

3366
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
entire fan community do not fuck

3367
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
this up. Do not not fuck this up.

3368
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Tigerclaw

3369
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
gives us one more tweet here about

3370
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
EA

3371
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
taking a part in American Cancer

3372
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Society's Making Strides Against

3373
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Breast Cancer Walk.

3374
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
It's nice to hear about the good things

3375
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
EA did. So let's

3376
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
talk about this. He links us to a story from

3377
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
Game Politics. Team EA

3378
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
took part in the American Cancer Society's

3379
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
Making Strides Against Breast

3380
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
Cancer Walk in San Francisco

3381
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
to raise funds for the fight against

3382
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
breast cancer. EA chief

3383
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
operating officer Peter Moore

3384
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
excuse me was on hand to kick off the

3385
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
event and walked with the employees.

3386
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
So very cool.

3387
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Good on you EA

3388
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
for doing your public service

3389
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
for an important cause.

3390
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
So there you go. Thank you guys

3391
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
very much for your tweets tonight.

3392
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

3393
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
and yes Tigerclaw I know there's one more tweet

3394
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
but it's a two tweet maximum.

3395
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
Loki any other last minute

3396
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
stories you want to share tonight?

3397
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Popcap and EA are

3398
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
teaming up with the ADA to

3399
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
give you free plants versus zombies

3400
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
for Halloween. I got an email on that.

3401
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
It's stopzombiemouth.com

3402
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
and

3403
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
it's kind of cool though I mean

3404
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
if you're like trying to be cheap about

3405
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
giving out candy and stuff like that you could be

3406
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
like one of those people that gives out something else.

3407
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
Well they have coupons that you can print off

3408
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
and basically

3409
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
those are they have a code on

3410
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
there that can be used between October 30th

3411
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
and November 10th to redeem a free copy of the

3412
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
PC version of plants versus zombies

3413
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
for PC or Mac and

3414
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
it's all the same code so

3415
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
you can print off sheets of those cut them

3416
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
up and give those out instead of candy if you want

3417
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
to or with candy

3418
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
or with candy

3419
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
and so you can do that

3420
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
if you don't feel like going to

3421
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
basically just go back to the

3422
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
stopzombiemouth.com website and

3423
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
use the code

3424
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
p-hater

3425
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
p-a-h-a-r

3426
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
p-hater

3427
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
one of the

3428
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
plants is a p-hat

3429
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
I think it

3430
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
it could be either way who knows

3431
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
I think it's a p-hater because they don't like getting hit in the

3432
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
face with peace

3433
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
not you know

3434
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
urine

3435
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
so there's that and then of course

3436
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
also this

3437
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
I was kind of talking about before

3438
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
I actually got to read the whole thing now

3439
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
apparently there's going to be some updates

3440
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
to the digital

3441
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
millennium copyright act

3442
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
remember before how it was okay

3443
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
to jailbreak your

3444
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
ipods and iphones and stuff like that

3445
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
not going to be the case anymore

3446
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
apparently

3447
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
it's only legal to

3448
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
jailbreak phones

3449
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
or just say unlocked prior to

3450
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
January 2013

3451
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
basically after that it is

3452
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
no longer legal to do that also

3453
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
it's no longer legal to

3454
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
jailbreak tablet devices

3455
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
or root tablet devices

3456
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
that's kind of

3457
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
unfortunate you know kind of a big step

3458
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
backwards to the whole thing

3459
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
and there's more

3460
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
more websites running that whole

3461
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
disney toy box thing but we already know what that is

3462
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
right I gotta say disney infinity

3463
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
has a great logo

3464
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
it does have a nice logo

3465
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
it's very interesting that

3466
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
you know one of the

3467
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
they have two different components of the game

3468
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
one of which would be

3469
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
let's see here

3470
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
pages not turning

3471
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
correctly one of which

3472
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
was dubbed the toy box

3473
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
and one of course

3474
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
is the actual characters

3475
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
the playsets

3476
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
the playsets of the toy box

3477
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
and of course tying in with Monsters U

3478
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
Cars

3479
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
The Lone Ranger

3480
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Incredibles, Toy Story

3481
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
and Pirates of the Caribbean

3482
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
and like we talked about last week

3483
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
it's two Johnny Depp movies if I'm not mistaken

3484
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
yes it is

3485
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
he's in a lot of stuff and it looks interesting

3486
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
they've got a picture here

3487
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
the reader looks really

3488
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
different not like

3489
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
you know say

3490
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
Skylanders but they've got

3491
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
these characters and these coins

3492
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
and then looks like

3493
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
boss characters almost like

3494
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
they have that mech thing

3495
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
from the Incredibles so you can

3496
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
team up with Buzz Lightyear

3497
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
and Mr. Incredible

3498
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
and stuff oh neat

3499
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
I don't know very interesting

3500
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
I hope the game's good I think

3501
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
it probably will be I mean considering

3502
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
how well Skylanders does

3503
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
and Skylanders to be honest is a very new property

3504
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
versus Disney

3505
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
characters which everybody fucking knows

3506
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
so

3507
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
