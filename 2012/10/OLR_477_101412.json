{"text": " George, Lounge, Radio These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, October 14th, 2012, an upcoming holiday game is leaked a month early, Valve is looking for some hardware testers, and could you soon feel temperature in your PlayStation controller? Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 477 for October the 14th of 2012. My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours here at vognetwork.com to talk about video games and gaming culture and so forth with my co-hosts. Sadly not with us tonight, yet again, DarkSakura, not here in studio, which I know a lot of you in the chat room might be going, wait a minute, she's right here. Well that's the magic of the internet you see. She's sick today. She caught Disneyland plague or something. She caught the gay. She went to gay days at Disneyland and wouldn't you know it, she walked away with a horrific case of the gay. And so she will not be here tonight, but she is in chat if you wish to say hello and feel better and so forth. Anyhow, with us tonight in studio we do have Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you, Loki? I'm alright. I have a cold. You have a cold, but it's not the gay. It's not the gay. Alright. The gay doesn't make you all stuffed up, I don't think. I know, I definitely have the gay because I'm sounding a little sick today, but I just blew out my voice over on Friday, but I'll talk about that later. Anyhow, also say hello too. We have a guest host here. We love it when he's available and on standby. Say hello to Alan. It's me again. How are you again? I'm good. What's new with you since the last time we talked to you? Not much. Working, working a lot. I wanted to pinch hit last week, but I had to work. My amazing boss got me the day off. You gotta make the money. There you go. And so actually it looks like your horrible terrible boss is in chat right now if you want to say a few words. Not kidding. I'm giving him a hard time on purpose. Alright, um, let's see. What else do I need to plug here at the top of the show? Oh yes, be sure you listen to us live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network. Or VOG Network dot com. Home to a variety of great geek shows. Not just video game shows. I think that's important to point out is that we do have some awesome video game shows obviously with this one and Bobby and Girls Gone Wow and Hardhouse. We also have some non-video game shows. Things like Understation Live, Pod Culture, Critical Myth, British Invaders, Out of My Jam Session, etc, etc. Lots of good stuff. So it all goes down at vognetwork.com. I was going to come with a kickoff topic tonight, but I neglected to think of something because I'm a little bit, my voice is shot tonight. Because, and I think a lot of other shows on the network have been talking about this, Understation Live, and I just mentioned this on Bobby's show before, and I think I mentioned it on here too. I was asked, I was fortunate enough to be asked to be the director of the Return of the Rocky Horror Picture Show here in Sacramento, and while it went marvelous on Friday, it was very exhausting. I also emceed the show. So I'm basically screaming obscenities into a mic in front of a crowd of 400 people, and it felt really good. It's not like what I do. Kind of. Kind of. On this show every week. Except I could see them. I couldn't hide from them. I could see them too. I knew you were going to lose your voice, so get damn close to it, because when you were shouting your intro, there was a part where you literally, like, you blew your voice out. Like, we could hear. That sound wasn't like... Yeah, no, and I think I even cracked a joke, like, oh, I didn't mean to go into puberty on stage or something like that. Yeah, it was like, he's not going to enjoy that the next morning. It was bad. It was bad, but we're okay. Well, I have a crazy idea for a topic, okay? Here's a kickoff topic, my crazy last minute topic tonight. So we know that this is the season for video games to become movies, because I don't know what it is, but every October, well, I do know what it is. It's the fact that October is kind of the month for Hollywood to release their crap films, which usually includes the video game movies. Like, you know, all the Resident Evil movies come out late September, October. We're getting Silent Hill, and I'm not saying these movies are crap, but Hollywood kind of views them as crap, because they're kind of in between this summer blockbuster and Oscar nominee. Oscar season starts at Thanksgiving. Exactly, so most video game movies end up coming out in the October season. Well, I think, you know, if they were actually supposed to be crap, they'd be coming out in January. I think that it's just a good time. I mean, the two movies that came out video game-wise this year are both kind of monster Halloween-y movies, sort of. I mean, Resident Evil's more of an action movie, but... But there's the Transylvania Hotel or whatever, and the Frankenweenie and all that stuff's coming out. Wreck-It Ralph very soon, actually. Although, technically, it's a November movie, and I think they're just... Wreck-It Ralph, I mean, here's the thing about Wreck-It Ralph. I know we're all excited about Wreck-It Ralph, right? Because it's Disney and it's video games. So, obviously, there's a great cross-section here that this show represents very well that is very excited for Wreck-It Ralph. But I think for... I'm not sure how it's gonna do in the mainstream. I think it is still kind of a risky thing for Disney, so I think that's why it's not their Thanksgiving movie or their Christmas movie. But it's kind of that odd little place. It's in a place where it will either flop horribly and disappear. I don't think that'll actually happen. Or it'll catch on and be able to sustain itself through Thanksgiving, because that's sometimes what a lot of family movies do. Family movies don't always have the huge opening weekend and then disappear off the map like October movies, like Paranormal Activity and stuff do. These movies tend to have consistent... They're not number one, but they're number three or something four weeks in a row. And that's kind of where I think Wreck-It Ralph's gonna end up. At least I hope the movie does well. I think it's gonna do better than that. The funny thing is I think it's gonna be a lot of parents who are actually into it because of all the Nintendo references and things they remember taking their kids. I think it's truly a movie that's geared towards both, and there's a lot of people that are excited about that. Anyway, I got on a tangent talking about Wreck-It Ralph. What I really wanted to ask about was since we're in this time of year where we talk about video game movies and so forth, I just finished doing a stage show. So what video game do you think deserves a stage show? What video game deserves an adaptation? It doesn't have to be a musical, but think Broadway style. What video game do you think should become a full-fledged on or off-Broadway production? Well, they've already kind of done this as a video, but Buggy Saints Row. Because that video was hilarious. Because it was done Broadway style. And it was hilarious. So I'd go for that and have a bunch of people doing the artistic dancing and singing and stuff like that and have video of Saints Row being buggy. Or you can even do Buggy Driver 3 because Driver 3 is probably very, very, very, very buggy. I want new music for that though. Alan, what would you want to see on Broadway? Maniac Mansion. That's probably almost too easy of an answer. It was a TV show at one point, right? Yeah. Or my troll answer is Echo the Dolphin. That wouldn't be a Broadway production so much as it would be like the tank show at SeaWorld. It'd be like Ice Capades. Someone comes out in a dolphin suit. They're swimming through rain. Hey, hey, hey. Are you saying that dolphins can't ice skate? Because I want to see that. Okay, they don't have to ice skate, but they can hop up and slide across the ice and then slip back into the water. Alright, let me get some answers from our chat room. I'm gonna go with the I can't believe Alan didn't say this answer. Mass Effect? Hello? Should Mass Effect be a musical? Come on. You can't do those effects on a stage. That needs a movie. That would be amazing. It would not be amazing. Let's look at some of the answers from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Wicked says Final Fantasy 6 the opera scene. I think that's a very, you know, well, I mean technically it was an opera. So it's like now you're talking about the play that became the video game that became the play. That's like Street Fighter 2 the movie the game type of thing. Dark Sakura is in our chat tonight saying Clu Clu Land. How would that work? Somebody would just pole dance on stage. Clu Clu Land would be a showgirls type thing. Irritating Stick. Katamari Damacy. Oh wow, that would be a hell of a stage show. It's like Lion King right there. It's like some crazy, crazy stuff. Someone like they're going to come out of there and be like, did I just drop acid or something? What happened to that? Stan in our chat room says Space Channel 5 should be on Broadway. Now there you go. There is a great musical idea. That could actually work, which is kind of sad. Sad in an awesome way though. Let's see, SSG100Matt says Parappa the Rappa. Let's see, Stan says in Chicago they've done a Mario Burlesque show. Same with Zelda I think. That's just cosplay strippers. I mean come on, that's all that is. Burlesque show. Okay fine, let's just add some class to that. It's a fucking cosplay person stripping. Hey now, I have friends that do burlesque that would take a lot of offense to what you're saying right now. Good, I aim to offend everybody. You are so rude. Well, here's the thing. At least you can say this, if the burlesque community has done it, you know what other communities probably done it? Drag queens. So my question is, has there been a Mario or Zelda drag queen show? Alan, you used to live in the city and go to these shows. What was the craziest drag queen show you saw in the city? They were all really amazing actually. One time I went they did Ziggy Stardust album from start to finish. Smashing Pumpkins, Drag Tribute Night. It was amazing. See, when I think of drag queens, I don't think of Smashing Pumpkins. That's why San Francisco is more alternative. Oh, excuse me. San Francisco's hipster drag apparently. The whole cabaret, the greatest love of all, you're not going to find that there. Rama in the chat says, Loki, I know people that do cosplay burlesque, dude. Burlesque stripping, fine. Are we really just going to like... Are you telling me that the end of the show that they don't end up with less clothing on, therefore they are stripping off clothing? It's the same thing. Alright, let me get to a few more answers here in chat. Frisbee says they've already done a Phoenix Wright musical in Japan. There's that movie coming that I keep forgetting is like a thing. So I hope I get to see that soon. Let's see if there's any other... Jessica Harper from Understation Live says, Crazy Taxi. It's one hell of a taxi ride. Can I have a Crazy Taxi musical? There you go. I want to change my answer. Okay, what do you want to say? Out of This World? You know that French game? Yeah, I think Jamie did that as a classic game once, yeah. Good answer. Awesome. And DJ Morpheus in chat says, I saw a peach drag queen at New York Comic Con. Actually, I got to say the peach drag queen thing has been done at several conventions. I've seen that. So, there you go. Thanks to the wonders of the internet. Whenever a dude dresses up as peach, it's always on the internet the next day. Alright, there you go. So in our kickoff topic, we managed to talk about burlex shows, drag queens, musicals, and offend people. There you go. I'd say kickoff topic well done. Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games we've been playing this week. Alan, I usually let Dark Sakura start. She's not here. I'll let you start. How was your gaming week? Good. Mass Effect 3, the DLC that came out, I've been playing the hell out of that. You guys talked about it a little bit last week. The Collectors, which were the antagonists in 2, are now an enemy class that you can roll into in the multiplayer matches. And I unlocked the Volus Adept, which is an ultra rare and seven unlockable character. And I'm sure saying Volus Adept is the same as saying Pineapple Toaster Oven to most people in our listeners. Pineapple Toaster Oven? Awesome! I like pineapple and I like toaster ovens. Sounds amazing. I unlocked one of the new coveted secret characters. How about a toaster oven that cuts the pineapple for you? So you don't have to. I played some Black Mesa Source a little bit, but not as much as I have been because I already went through and beat it and I'm waiting for them to patch in the end of the game. Mass Effect Infiltrator, because about three weeks ago I upgraded my phone. I now have a Galaxy S3. I believe Bobby Blackwolf got one about a month ago. So I downloaded the Infiltrator Mass Effect game for it. It looks gorgeous, but it controls so bad that it makes me angry that I spent the four bucks on it. It controls so poorly for me that it makes me feel like... If you've ever had someone, like you show them a game like Saints Row or Grand Theft Auto and it's someone who does not play video games and you have the controller and you're like, okay, here's how you move and here's how you get in the car and then you just drive off a cliff. The first thing you do is they just die because they don't know how to play games. Infiltrator controls so poorly that it makes me feel like I'm one of those people. And I told James about it and he has it on iPad and he said that he made himself beat it just because he has a boner for Mass Effect. And he's like, oh yeah, the game's a total piece of shit. I can't believe I beat it all the way through. I really wanted to like it. There's a lot to like about it. Like for a phone game, it looks really good. Yeah, it looks like Mass Effect. It's an over-the-shoulder action game. Because it's all with your thumbs. You just swipe to... it's horrible. Stop trying to make touch gaming happen. Like it sucks for some of these hardcore franchises. Well, Fruit Ninja, yes. For whatever they're doing in that game, no. That's really it, I think. Oh, and Tiny Tower. I know a lot of Tiny Tower, which is like a two-year-old iPhone game. But since you're coming off having the phone that doesn't even have a QWERTY keyboard on it, too. I had the Blackberry equivalent of the Nokia brick. You know, the classic, you know, you throw the Nokia brick at a car and the car explodes. And the brick is fine. I had the Blackberry equivalent of that. And now, so going from that to this Android ice cream sandwich. Ooh, you know, little laptop in your pocket is quite a change. Yeah, in Tiny Tower, I give all of my stores perverted names. The laundromat is called the Stank Panties. I've got... the TV studio is named after a porn website, which I'm not going to say. So it's porn studio because of the name I gave it. So yeah, it's good times. Good times killer game. Now, just to fan the flames of this, what made you decide to go with the Galaxy S3 on the day the iPhone 5 came out? To be pragmatic about it, you represent the Apple portion of this household, which is fine. I'm not hating on that. But it's like, if we want to be, you know, the ultimate geek duo, we need Android representation up in here so that people can come to us and they will ask Rob the Apple questions, they can ask me the Android questions. If I want to be pragmatic about it, make sure all of our braces are covered. That is the best possible answer you could have given. Good job. This is why I keep you here. So I will investigate whatever it is that you don't like. Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week? So when they ask you about the Apple stuff, like, why should I get an iPhone 5? Because it's new! You gotta get the new thing. So this week I've actually been trying to catch up on a lot of stuff that I haven't been playing because I've been playing a lot of Minecraft or whatever. So let's see. This week I played some Vita stuff. That was also another thing. I wanted to play games on the Vita because I haven't been and it was sorely neglected. So I tried out a couple demos I had. First, Gravity Rush, which was pretty cool. Just not really something, I mean, it's a good game but it's not something I'm going to be playing because I just don't want to play a lot of different games right now. I've already got plenty of my play right now but it's a unique looking game. It was fun. So I played that. I played Little Big Planet Vita. Well that was something I was like, oh, I'm probably going to get this but then I played it and it's Little Big Planet. It's great but it's got, you know, the Vita gimmicks that you kind of expect in there and I was just kind of like, eh, it's another Little Big Planet game. Probably won't play this so I'm not going to get it. That's kind of a bummer. Well no, it's not that at all. It's a good game. It's just, I have Little Big Planet 2 that I haven't played. Why am I going to buy another Little Big Planet game that I probably won't play? I need to finish other games first before, you know, I'm just trying not to get into that mode of like, I need to get all these games because they're good. Then I'm going to be sitting on all these games that are good and not have time to play them and then more good stuff is going to come out and I'm not going to have time to play that. I ended up, you know, there's a ton of games I have that are really old that I haven't played yet like 3D Dot Game Heroes. I've lent that out to so many people and I have yet to play that game. It's a good game. It is a good game. I know it's a good game but that game came out around the same time as like Red Dead Redemption or something and it was just like, ooh, Red Dead Redemption, you know, and I just kind of lost track of that. We have a new story coming up later and maybe I'll mention it to them but there's this really good, really, really good sale going on right now on a bundle of games and they're like all things that people tell me I should play and I've missed. And it's like, wow, for a very, very, very small amount of money I could like catch up on three years worth of gaming. And for that amount of money I think it's a good deal even if you don't play them because that amount of money for one of those games is so- We're getting ahead of ourselves though, sorry. The game I actually did want to play and I bought it mainly because it came out on this platform first was Retro City Rampage. I've been looking forward to this game forever now and they have the whole cross-buy thing on the PlayStation Network so you can get it for your PS3 and Vita so I bought it for my Vita and it's fantastic. If I didn't have a cold, you know, at the point when I was playing it my body was aching and my eyes were just like burning. If it wasn't for that I would probably have played a lot more of it but it's a fantastic game and there's just so many homages to everything. It's just crammed full of just so much fan service and just like oh my god I remember that and even stuff that will probably fly over your head but it's a fantastic game. It's just basically the best description I read for it was someone says the developers love letter to the industry for all the 8-bit games that he played and stuff like that. It even has modern references and stuff in it but the story is just throwaway. It makes no sense whatsoever but it's got everything and it's seriously a great game. So I am looking forward to playing that on my PlayStation 3 hopefully but on the Vita it's still pretty awesome. Although the game does tend to make the screen a lot smaller like in different sections of the map and stuff like that. So playing on a Vita, I'm sure it's not so bad on a TV but on the Vita the screen gets really small so that might be something that might turn people off from it but it's a fun game. Especially if you like Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2 it's very much like that but even if you don't like Grand Theft Auto it's still a great action game with all sorts of crazy stuff in it. From Bionic Commando to Bill and Ted to Back to the Future. It's great. And then of course more Minecraft. I played a lot more Minecraft. I fished up my castle basically. I don't know. Come join the server if you haven't yet. And then Call of Duty we bought Map Pack 2 so we're going to start playing some new maps because we're just kind of getting bored of the ones we were playing. Once again tried doing another streak week. Missed it by another game. Oh well. Getting close. Getting close. And what else? I think that was it actually. I think that was all the games I played. So Alan you'll get a kick out of this. You know how the live listeners will understand this. Podcast listeners I apologize for a minute but we're having these stream dropouts. It looks like it's happened twice. And yeah we just so you guys know we actually purposely left the internet off for an hour today while we went to go run errands. The cable modem and the router off for an hour. Let's do a complete power cycle of every damn technological thing in this house so OLR can stay up with no downtime tonight. Now we're on 2. So it's like it is not in this house. Like the problem is not in this house. The problem is Comcast on their end. Spell hey you know why you guys keep dropping our stuff. Well I wonder if it's not because sometimes I see that we're still sending data and they start complaining in chat that it dropped and I'm like it didn't drop because I see that we're still sending data. Because if Comcast goes down then our net should stop working. I should get booted from IRC. All of that should happen. So that makes me wonder is it our stream provider that's really having the issue. But it doesn't happen to Bobby. That's right it doesn't happen to Bobby. He's on it for an hour. So what the hell is the problem? Could be our is he where is sorry forget it all. Where's where's where's it located. Where where are we piping to right now. That's a good question that I don't know the answer to that maybe Bobby does. Because if it's in the Midwest or the South it could be our connection to there and he's you know Anna. It very well could be. Let me see if this tells me where we beam the show to because I'm actually not sure. I know but you know what deal with it. He says New Jersey so you would be infinitely closer. Oh yeah so for us if we're piping in New Jersey then there's yeah it's probably the stream weird to us. This is New Jersey so no wonder the streams oh stop it. Who else do you want to offend tonight while we're at it. We're still early and we haven't even started story. You've done burlesque people. New Jersey not saying there's anything wrong burlesque burlesque is awesome. Because it's once again women stripping off their clothes which is you know that's fine. I think really the only difference between burlesque and strippers the strippers kind of go all the way whereas burlesque is more of the teas and stuff. Yeah but they're still stripping off their clothes. They're just they're just like you know skin Amex strippers versus you know the stripper strippers. I guess. Oh boy all right. Who spilled Jager and spray tan on the server rack. Moving on to my gaming week. I had a very dark soccer week. My gaming week was very dark soccer. Does everybody know what that means. That's right I played him. No no no that's that's dark soccer circa 2009 gaming week. My gaming week this week was I played a lot of wow. I did some dailies and you know just I shouldn't say a lot of wow because I didn't play a lot of wow but I played you know because I've had weeks where I played a lot of wow. But this is not one of those weeks but I played enough wow to do like a few dailies here and there and so forth. And then I played Mass Effect 3 because as Alan mentioned the new DLC went up the multiplayer DLC and it's very well rounded. It's got a whole new class of aliens that you can fight the collectors from part two. So that breathes new life into it. It has some new classes. It doesn't matter because I won't be seeing them anyway because I never get that stuff in my premium specter packs but I did finally get one of the ones I really wanted. It's called Cerberus Adept and I've been playing that class a lot because he's the guy with the whips and you're just like Hulk smash Hulk smash everything and it's great. Vanguard's like that too. Yeah it's awesome. Like we were doing a multiplayer match earlier with some friends and one of my friends was like who sent the body flying out the window. I'm like me. So yeah Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is still really fun and I like that they've staggered this content a bit. So like what is it every Tuesday we're going to get just a handful of new things right? Every Tuesday for a little while? That's awesome. I don't know if they're doing it because there's 16 new kits where a kit is a character within a class. So we got four of them. There's supposed to be 16 so that's only a month's worth if they're going to do four a week. They should probably do every other week. Maybe every other week. That would make it. Because next weekend should be the next scenario challenge because they do that every other weekend. And the other big thing they added is they have kind of like mini achievements now. Like it kind of runs on a similar system to like achievements or trophies but you're not unlocking official things. They're not game achievements. It's within the multiplayer. Like you've used biotic charge 30,000 out of 50,000 times. So when you hit the 50,000 and then you can unlock titles that appear next to your handle in game lobbies. So kind of similar to like Street Fighter IV has that kind of similar idea there. So that breathes some life into it too because it's like oh now I have all these things to work for. Because if you've been a person that's been playing Mass Effect 3 multiplayer since launch which there is a lot of people that have been. You've probably got all the other achievements by now. I mean there's not a lot else to work towards. Alan, heck you haven't even been playing since launch but you're in seven score is what 800 and something now? It's like 820 now. It would be higher but when I do golds and silvers I'm usually on a level 20 and they don't gain XP. Oh okay. I see. Gotcha. Alright. Alright well that was my gaming week. So let's move into some housekeeping. We are on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We are on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio. I believe today or tomorrow, I think it's tomorrow, is the last day to nominate us for the podcast awards. So please for your consideration, Best Gaming Podcast and the Stitcher Awards also going on right now and I think they end either tomorrow or Friday. So please consider a nomination for us there as well for Best Gaming Podcast. If for whatever reason you don't want to vote for us that's cool. Please support one of the other shows on the VOG Network or at least bare minimum support Indie Podcast. And then Stitcher I believe it's every day or every day you can vote. You can nominate for Stitcher every day. You can. So podcast award is just one nomination. So we'll keep our fingers and toes crossed and let you know what happens either next week or in a couple weeks when those nominations are announced. Remember you know usually I hate the whole begging for votes thing but it really is good exposure and these guys you know as much as some of these big podcasts are fine. The NPR podcasts are great. Like wait wait don't tell me he's a great show. The Adam Carolla show is a fine show if you like him and all that. But the problem you know they don't need the additional exposure. They have plenty of corporate exposure and stuff so we really want to see the indies succeed in these. Because there's a lot of really good indie programs too. Just like there's good indie games. Anyhow let's move on to the news. Oh wait no one other thing I got to plug. Very important. I always like to plug the shows that are kind enough to invite me on as a guest. And I was a guest this week. I don't know how I fit this in this week but I did. I was a guest on Nerdgasm Network their gaming show. It's episode 54. I don't think it was on their feed yet when I checked because they are having some website up seas and down seas but it will be you know very soon. Nerdgasmnetwork.com so take a look for episode 54. I was on it. And I felt really bad because I had to go before they were done but it was just that kind of week last week. So hopefully they'll have me back at some point because we had some funny in-jokes that were going on there so I had a good time. So you'll hear more about putting it all out on the table and I'll just leave it at that. Alright let's get into some gaming news. And Burlesque Top I guess. Yeah yes. Actually very similar to Burlesque but in a different way. Let's move on to gaming news Loki. So it's another year so another Microsoft game has been leaked. Hurrah! Apparently Microsoft is investigating a report of Halo 4 being leaked and they're working with law enforcement to address the issue. And you know there's images being surfaced on social networking sites depicting retail discs and a dashboard featuring the game ready to play blah blah blah. It's already leaked. Yes it's absolutely 100% been leaked. It's out there. And of course you know they're like well we're clarified with that's actually it's been leaked. 100% it's been leaked. Okay. Has it been leaked? It's been leaked. I don't know that much more you can say other than it's pretty good. And also I guess some other information. Apparently the game is going to be on two discs. The second disc is going to contain installation data for the multiplayer stuff and once you've installed that then you can actually play the game with the first disc. Kind of like Forza 4. Now Loki help me understand something. How are people able to play this game before the release date? Uhhhhh. Piracy. Oh. Okay. But piracy is bad. It is bad and they will get banned if they go online. That's it. And Microsoft called the po-po. Oh yeah. They're really investigating it. They're asking for it. Look. Obviously they're going to say you know they're going to invoke the police because and you know it is a crime. You can poo poo it all you want but stealing shit is a crime. Right? So but what will the police really do to investigate you think? Do you think the police is coming after little Johnny Pirate that went on the Pirate Bay and downloaded the program? Or do you think the police are looking more into how the leak happened? I think they're trying to find out how it got leaked. Well then the police aren't doing a very good job. I hate to say it but let's see Gears of War 3 leaked. Halo 3 leaked. Like every big Microsoft title leaks. Did Fable the Journey leak or did that just slip off the radar? No. Any title like out there. Any title that's being released is leaked usually a week before it comes out. And the reason that happens is because that's how the shipment schedule is for retailers. They usually get stuff you know Monday prior or you know if it's you know direct retail partners like say GameStop and Best Fies and stuff like that. They're getting their product probably the week before on Wednesday or something. Now here's how I think this happened. And this is totally speculative. I have no... This is not the week before. Halo's not supposed to be out till like for like three weeks. Yeah exactly. Here's how I think it happened. Well a couple of ways. One, someone nabbed a copy when they were pressing it. You know an actual copy out of the duplicator. Or this happens occasionally. The warehouse that ships the product, the Microsoft product, will misship something and accidentally send something early. Like way earlier than they were supposed to receive it in. For example you know personally we had some Skylanders stuff you know for the new Skylanders Giants that they accidentally shipped us earlier than it should have been. Like about a week earlier. Which is usually unusual. Well lucky you. Some lucky asshole got me Halo 4. You got Skylanders. No no no. We're not doing anything with Skylanders. But I'm just saying it happens. There's been Microsoft released games in the last few weeks. We had Fable and then next week we've got Dance Central 3 and then we've got Forza Horizon. So there's going to be a lot of Microsoft shipments in the next few weeks. So perhaps one of those got out and somebody unscriptedlessly bought it or got a copy and put it out there. Or who knows. It could have just been somewhere else. An employee. You never know. Because it's one of the biggest games. This and probably Call of Duty Black Ops 2 are going to be like the ones. The scene groups out there fighting each other. Who's going to be able to release it first. And you know it's all bragging. All E-peen bragging rights basically. Like oh I'm playing Halo and you're not. So that's it. So here's the question I have to ask. How can Microsoft stop this? How can Microsoft stop that leak from happening? They can't. They have to be more secure about how they duplicate their game. Just the whole handling process of it. The way other publishers do it. At least they try to prevent street day violators is by delivering a product as late as possible to those retail chains. So we're talking like you know getting a day early instead of a week early. That type of thing. But obviously it's something like this. This hasn't even. I mean as far as we're aware this hasn't even hit the retail chains yet. This is just some screw up somewhere where something either got shipped way earlier than it was supposed to or someone internally leaked it out. That's the problem. But the team they have they've had problems with leaks just in the last few years all the time. I mean was it last year there was Gears of War 3. Remember that game got leaked down the Web. You know by Microsoft or I'm sorry it was a third party review company or some garbage that they were saying. But basically the actual source code and I or it was like the source code in something was leaked out and you can actually download it off of an unencrypted Web site or something. It was just ridiculous. So yeah it's not good but I don't think it's really going to hurt them in the end. I mean they're still going to sell a buttload of those. Yeah I mean the reality is you kind of have to ask yourself if you're going to download one of these games and so forth. Am I the type of person that sits there and goes aw every time I hear one of these stories about game developers closing or why did Big Bad EA close such and such developer or you know so forth. Yet I'm not allowing said company to make money. You kind of can't have both right. Now I don't think people have to get paid. Yeah I don't think that's fair though. I think what you're basically saying though those are a lot of these secondary companies and stuff and some of it has nothing to do with you know how well the game sold for they need to cut profits because it didn't sell as many copies as they thought it would not necessarily because piracy ate up you know hundreds of thousands of copies. I mean because once again that's assuming that every person that pirates something would have bought the game regularly. I bet you a lot of people that pirate the game are probably just they want to play it early and they're going to still buy their preorder when it comes out or you know they were never going to buy the game in the first place and they would have pirated it when it came out. You know normally it's just that's once again you can't the industry can't just assume that each one of those is a lost sale as much as I don't want to agree with you I think I actually kind of do I think a vast number of people who pirate games were never going to buy that game in the first place. I'm going to tell you this much. They only download it because they can. Exactly. And you know I I did with grant the thought of four grand thought of four came out it leaked down the Internet one week before it came out. I still bought the game. I want to play it right now. I want to play it as early as possible and so I did. I played it a week early but who cares. I think I've more than paid for it. I bought what six copies of the game when it came out and it's six copies of episodes from Liberty City when it came out and six copies of the first deal. See before you know the episodes from Liberty City stuff came out. I think they got my money. So I don't feel so bad about you know playing the game a week early. I think this is why the industry is very eager to get on digital distribution. I think this is why you see some companies may be rushing digital distribution and really trying to push it more and more is because if you think about it digital distribution is a great way to curb piracy. It won't stop it but it would stop these leaks from happening because essentially you've cut out the entire process of printing the disks and the going gold and shipping and the problems there. You're cutting that all out. No leaks out even earlier than games like this. Xbox Live arcade games. Wow. They leak out even earlier. No why. Why have access to partner net still people download them off partner net and they put them out. They crack it and put it out. Yeah they crack and put out so digital distribute the people are going to find ways around everything. All they want to do is to cut out the mailman with that stuff so that means more profits for them. It's not going to curb more piracy people are going to find a way no matter what. I mean no matter what they put out there people are going to find a way. But a game like you know Halo 4. Yeah it's going to get part of it. I mean all the games get pirated but I don't think that they're going to sell like it's not going to be like oh crap. It didn't sell at all. That's not going to happen there. No one's going to shut down 343 studios because it didn't sell because of all piracy. It just ruined the whole game. No it's not like that. There's not that many people you know compared to the millions of people buy that pirate games is such a small section but they would want you to think it is because you know they got to blame their loss of sales on something. Do you think though that if this hadn't happened maybe they would have sold a quarter million more copies. No because if this hadn't happened it's going to leak out again when it comes out and the same people will pirate it. Rama in our chat room says Halo 4 could come out at $19.99 and yet it will be pirated. Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com follows that up with iPhone piracy is rampant and that's 99 cent apps. I think that's a perfect example where it's like people do it because they can. I mean if you're given someone the option to get some free versus paying for it. Why wouldn't you get it for free. I mean I understand that there's this whole morality of oh well if I don't pay. I mean they try to push this shit on you even in legality. You are taking a risk. I understand that but it's just OK. It's it would be like I don't know it'd be like walking into a department store and all sudden there's like hundreds of looters inside there and they all scatter in every single direction. Good luck catching every single one of those. I mean it's a risk but you know the officer is not going to be able to catch every single person. It's kind of the same way piracy. Yeah people get nabbed every now and then but there's so many people and so much piracy happening that you know it just has a hole like over everything that you can't catch everybody. The best defense is to stop the people that upload them in the first place and then there's nothing for them to pirate. You know what though I think I could look you in the eye with a straight face and totally mean it and say you would never catch me down there being one of those looters. I just think it's wrong. And like I would never participate in a looting event like that and I really believe that about my character like and I'm not trying to say like I'm better than anybody else or whatever but I know like they had a situation like that happen in Britain. Not that long ago like there were these huge riots and all these things and there were these looting and you know a bunch of kids got caught went to jail and all this stuff and I remember looking at it going what a bunch of fucking thugs. I wouldn't be one of those thugs. That is ridiculous that stuff. I mean my analogy was that there's how do you go after everybody. You can't. Yeah because yeah as a literal metaphor I don't really think that's the best comparison. There's a huge difference between the plausible deniability of maybe downloading a torrent from the privacy of your own bedroom versus throwing a chair through a storefront window. Of course once again the video game industry or the movie industry would like you to think that that's exactly the same thing. Yes. The great debate that will never end. But maybe this is why we see more free to play games happening because it's like fuck it. We'll make our money other way. No seriously that's a great idea. As long as you could secure DLC. But that's a great idea because then it's like fuck pirated as much as one gives me copies out there because that's more people that can buy the DLC for it. And that's why I think it is more popular approach because it gets the game into more people's hands and more people want to try because it's free there. I if it sucks whatever I just delete it you know. And that that's why I think it is a good way to go. But then again at the same time some of these companies are getting greedy and they're taking the free to play model for their paid games and that just pissing people off even more and they're like fuck you I'm just going to not only am I going to pirate this game but I'm also going to pirate all your DLC. Alright well moving on. This piracy debate will never be settled so I'm going to go ahead in the interest of time and move on with the news. But what a great segue talking about a game that a lot of people probably just should have pirated. Let's be real it wasn't very good. No I'm kidding. I'm trolling I'm trolling. But pirated DLC and all that definitely goes with this too. It's Street Fighter X Tekken. I'm sorry you can't pirate something that's already on the disc. There's a whole nother argument we could save for another day. Is it piracy when it was on the disc anyway? We'll save that for next week. Alright but moving on. This wasn't on the disc what I'm about to talk about. It's a free what they call hefty like the trash bags hefty update later this year. It is supposed to rebalance the game, provide visual and mechanical tweaks which I find interesting that they're going to actually tweak some of the visuals. Every character in Street Fighter X Tekken is supposed to get some type of balancing tweaks and so forth. Including Ken, Kazuya, Kami, Julia and so on and so on. Lots lots. Also don't forget Street Fighter X Tekken is coming to the Vita. I don't know if that means these same balancing things are already in that finished version or if there's a day one patch or whatever. But that is due on October 23rd as a reminder that's just around the corner Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita. Didn't that game flop? I think flop is a strong word but I think it. Just perform as well as they'd probably hope. Word of mouth from friends who are usually like Capcom for life and just the reviews are like this is not very good. What I'm really curious about is where's the other half of this because we were supposed to be seeing Tekken cross Street Fighter and I'm wondering. I think it's still a long way away. Namco just started working on it this year. Wow. Like began. They already had their we're gonna Tekken tag too so. Maybe they've been kind of developing them side by side. They have the engine now they've made the engine so it's been. This wasn't the their joint project for this was announced what two or three years ago right. I think when they did the press release the Namcom is making one and Capcom is making one. Yeah that was two or three years ago. But yeah no. Namco has only just now started even designing the game. So maybe next year or the year after. We'll see maybe maybe it'll be on the next generation of consoles maybe this is a PlayStation 4 game troll troll. Although yes they were busy if they wait too long it's going to have to be if they wanted to sell but anyway let's move on. To register participation for this week's episode of orange lounge radio at vog network dot com use the pass phrase crown. Do you live in the Seattle area. If so no. If you do you might want to head over to a valve software's website and take a little play tester survey. And see if maybe you could become a hardware tester for their valve appliance which clearly exists in some form though. They haven't given it a name and we don't know what exactly it has a fridge. I hope it's a pineapple toaster oven. So yeah and if you are in the Seattle and Bellevue area is it is that right. They're looking for hardware testers and there's just it's a questionnaire. How long have you been gaming. Are you a completionist are you an achievement hunter. How often do you unlock hundreds of everything. How often do you beat like it. Do you beat completely every game that you play from start to finish. You would be qualified for this Rob. Shut up. Well you can expect people that go into this to have to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Up through the teeth. And you can expect that those will be broken. Wait. So from whatever however many months ago that they were looking for hardware engineers. They have an alpha clearly that they are they want people under lock and key to go check out. Very interesting. Whatever their steam box is. I look forward to what leaks out of this. Moving on Loki. Alright. So of course remember that there was the announcement that Sony has bought Gaikai. And so now Gaikai's website they've been updated to kind of resemble a little bit more of the PlayStation lineup. You see images of living planet as well as uncharted and looks like kill zone in there as well. They have some skills from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. And you know they didn't really say you know what any additional details or something. But obviously it seems like this is something that's going to be offered as part of the PlayStation platform soon. So you can probably expect some game streaming either by the end of this year or maybe an announcement E3. Nothing else. Unfortunately around the same time though. So Gaikai they've kind of found themselves as part of a patent lawsuit on a Delaware company called T5 Labs. They filed a suit against them. I guess their patent for providing a system and methods of sharing and graphics processing unit between plurality of programs. That's the patent. Now I'm not sure if this is just a patent troll company or if this is actually a company that does this stuff. But I'd be willing to bet it's probably a patent company. So they have no comment on it but there is the lawsuit in place. Is this what really put on live out of business. Because I would have thought if anybody was going to complain it would have been you know one of the other companies that deals in this you know same technology. I just you know I'm willing to bet the T5 Labs probably hasn't put anything out. You probably can't even find them on the Internet. I'm going to even check that out right now. Let's see T5 Labs. Let's see are they even a part of the Internet. Here we go. T5 Labs dot com and. And yeah it looks like they've got some just crappy flash animation on here. But it's implied that it has to do with games because. Because they've got static TV and it's tied to a server and what games do they make. Oh good. They have these the whole Star Wars scroll on here because that's not annoying to read. T5 Labs enables people to play PC games on their existing set top box. There's the service operates on the video on demand client type system and says T5 Labs patent pending technology allows the system to work on the ultra low latency. We call it instant gaming. So it well that does sound like it does seem like. Well it does seem like then that they are actually making something it's not a patent troll company. So I guess I am corrected. All right. But that is is refreshing to see that they're not just a patent troll. All right well moving on. I guess I'll troll you all by talking about Mass Effect because you know we don't shut up about that on this show. I know you're a big fan of this. Well Alan are you looking forward to the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC. Why are you so excited about that. Because it's Carrie-Anne Moss. She's going to fucking shoot bitches in the face. She's like fuck you. I'm Carrie-Anne Moss. Like Carrie-Anne Moss was in the Matrix which was cool like 12 years ago. She was also the mom in that Shayla Buff movie and I saw that. Oh and she I think she's in the new Silent Hill movie as well actually. Okay. Yeah I think she's one of the crazy cool I think she plays the villainess I think. Yeah. So where was the Borg Queen last time. This time it's Carrie-Anne Moss. There you go. Well anyhow I suggest you do not fuck with Aria in the Mass Effect 3 Omega DLC. Which they are saying will be double the size of Leviathan. Leviathan wasn't that big of a DLC campaign though. It really wasn't. Now Lair of the Shadow Broker is still the one that they need to beat as far as quality and length. Because Lair of the Shadow Broker in Mass Effect 2 was a badass campaign from start to finish. Yeah Lair of the Shadow Broker was great. And especially if Omega is going to be kind of like a hub like the Shadow Broker Lair was that you got into. Yeah. That would be great. Omega was probably one of the best design places in the entire trilogy. Because if you're a science fiction geek like I am a lot of the design was based off of, oh I'm blanking. Harrison Ford in the 80s. Blade Runner. A lot of Omega is based off a lot of the scenes in Blade Runner. And the music was amazing and I'm really glad that we're revisiting this place in 3. Also the big news about this DLC. Female Turians for the first time you're going to see. Yeah. Now. Fans are wary. There's always the comic books and so forth where they've shown up. But the first time in the game is certainly a big deal. Yeah. The fans of course want to see. When you say the fans you mean who? Tumblr? BioWare forms? All of that. The fandom. Because a lot of people want to see female Turians because the entire trilogy. How do Turians have sex? Because clearly they're all men everywhere. People are worried that they're just going to put a Turian head on tits armor. And be like, there it is. They're fucking reptiles they shouldn't have tits. Thanks BioWare. I'm interested to see what they do. And when you're talking about all of it you've researched the fandom through extensive online research right? Yes. I track Mass Effect tags on Tumblr. And what sorts of things do you participate with in the fandom? I just reblog stuff and favorite stuff. Have you ever written a fanfic? No. No I don't. Have you ever read a fanfic? I've read some hot M. Shenko stuff. What was your favorite M. Shenko? I think it was Caden was jogging through the citadel in booty shorts. And everyone was catcalling him and Shepard was all flustered and offended. Caden was like, I don't know. I can't believe you actually had an answer for that. That's great. Anyhow, just trolling you live on air. Anyhow, also apparently about this new DLC, one of Mass Effect 2's characters, Zaid Masani, is supposed to return in this. I don't remember him being in 3. No, he was in 1 quest, wasn't he? Yeah, he's in the quest with the little Volus from 1. That's right. And he's in the refugee camp. You can talk to him. Yes, Zaid sucked anyway. Sorry, this is my opinion. $15 for the DLC, which is on the pricier end of Mass Effect. Absolutely. Is that more than Shadow Broker was? Was Shadow Broker $10 or was Shadow Broker also $15? I think it might be $8 or $9 now. I don't know how much it was back in 2011. Well, it's going to cost you $15 now, so hopefully there will be enough to substantiate that. Now, if you look at the multiplayer, even if you don't play multiplayer at all, which, if you don't, I do think you should give Mass Effect 3 a shot. If you're scared that like, oh, I'm going to suck at multiplayer or whatever, or I don't like first person shooters or whatever, I do urge you, give Mass Effect 3 multiplayer a shot because the fact that it's all co-op based gives it a much different feeling than playing Halo or Modern Warfare Online. I've never had a bad experience, but I'm on the PC model, which is probably the smallest base of all the multiplayer because they're not integrated. PS3's got its own thing and XBLA's got its own thing. Believe it or not, on the 360, I've never had a bad experience. Go figure. Outside of connection issues, but it's better on the 360 than it is on Origin. But that's another story. Anyway, the new DLC gives you a great idea of probably what you're going to see in this Omega expansion. I mean, I can't see how they're not going to use the collector stuff. I mean, if they've done all the work to put them into multiplayer, I can't see how they're not going to show up somehow. It'd be very easy to justify in the lore. Yeah, I was going to say, even though Cerberus took Omega, I'm sure there's a way to work it. And Cerberus... I'm going to get so nerdy in the ending of 2. Cerberus took the remnants of the collector base at the end of 2, even if you blow it up, they still have it. So they could be controlling the collectors now, or the collectors show up and ambush both you and Cerberus. Either way. Shane Alinko in chat says they say that it's Cerberus, Rob, for Omega. So that means nothing but Cerberus is going to show up? Yeah, but that could be the plot twist, that the collectors are there too. But yeah, all through 3, Arya talks about how it's Cerberus. The Illusive Man kicked her out, and she's pissed. And then, of course, maybe some of these other weapons that have been showing up and so forth, and even maybe the maps, because multiplayer maps get used in single-player sometimes. Yeah, a lot of the multiplayer maps are unique to multiplayer, though. Not originally. But you definitely see some multiplayer maps, or you see some single, like in the Leviathan DLC, I could have sworn one of those maps looked a lot like one of the multiplayer maps, but it was just kind of different. It was a different layout, but kind of like the same assets. Anyhow, all right, enough Mass Effect talk. Loki's getting bored. I'm sorry, I just totally tuned out that whole last segment. All right, hater, let's move on. Maybe you'll be more interested in what Alan has to say. Remember Darkstalkers? 2D fighting game, really creative characters, really underrated franchise. Well, Capcom is bringing it back. Darkstalkers Resurrection was announced at New York Comic-Con this past week, and it is a HD cleanup of Darkstalkers 2 and 3, and it's bundled together in one pack, similar to Marvel vs. Capcom Origins. And also, if you remember the Final Fight Magic Sword combo, where you can have it look like an arcade cabinet or you can have it be full screen, it's going to be a package like one of those. And it's going to be, I think, 1200 Microsoft points or 1499. So, yay, Darkstalkers. Were you a fan of Darkstalkers? Oh, I had a modded Saturn, Sega Saturn, and I imported Darkstalkers 3. Nice. Because it used the 4-meg RAM cart for the people that played X-Men vs. Street Fighter on the Saturn, if you remember that. It supported the 4-meg RAM cart. It was arcade perfect. It was gorgeous. Do you think you'll be picking this up? I'm going to say no, just because how often do I turn on the 360? Seriously. Fair enough. Well, if they ever shut down the Mass Effect 3 servers, maybe you'll have a reason to. Yeah, it's possible. Mass Effect 4 Xbox exclusive, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? I'm just kidding. I'm trolling them. Didn't they announce a new Darkstalkers game, or was this all the announcement was? I think they were teasing that something was going to happen, and I think this is that something, but obviously I think it's trying to either get people talking about Darkstalkers again, or to gauge interest for a new Darkstalkers. I kind of think this is where Capcom's going. I think there's interest to get this franchise revitalized, and I'm sure this is a big step in either getting the awareness out there before a possible E3 announcement, or gauging it in the first place. A lot of people don't realize, well, the real people who've been with Capcom since the beginning will know this, but the combo system used in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and the combo system used in Marvel vs. Capcom, the light, light, medium, medium, hard, hard, where you do the zigzag across all six buttons, that chain combo system, that was done in Darkstalkers. That's the engine that they did that crazy combo system in. Wasn't that also Killer Instinct? You could kind of do that too? Those were weird, like Link. Those were very specific things you had to do. When you say zigzag combos with the six buttons, that's honestly what I think of. I think of Killer Instinct before I think of that, but I get you. All right, well, let's travel around the world and look at some release dates of some games coming out near you a little sooner than Darkstalkers, perhaps. Let's start with the US, Loki. All right, so let's see here. This week, we have quite a few things coming out, starting off with Rocksmith, guitar and bass. Technically, it's like the first game with the bass expansion, but they've got that coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, as well as bundled with an electric guitar. Dance Central 3 coming out this week on Xbox 360. Mugen Souls on PlayStation 3. Also, let's see here. We've got 007 Legends on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. What else here? Doom 3 BFG Edition on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. Noomba Fitness Core on the Wii and Xbox 360. Jeopardy on PS3 and 360. Wheel of Fortune also on PS3 and 360. Silent Hill Book of Memories for the Vita. Man, that's been delayed forever. That's finally coming out. That was delayed quite a bit. Yeah, because I don't think it was very good from what I hear. Maybe they made it better. I certainly hope so. Otherwise, it's going to be kind of a disappointment. Not that I'm not used to them being a disappointment. Let's see, what else? I do know that one week from today, because they have to launch it on a Sunday because it's so special, Skylighter Giants coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, 3DS, and I think that's it. Also, they're going to have a portal owner's pack in case you think about the first game. So that would be it. All right, let's travel to Japan and look out there. Actually, wait, I want to read a comment from chat real quick. Tigerclaw in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, when are they going to do a rock smith for keyboards? Like, keyboard smith. If they do that, I am so there. Like, I'm not that interested in learning how to play guitar, honestly, but I used to play the organ, like the double-decker pianos with top and bottom. I used to play that when I was younger, like way younger, like 5 to 10, and I can still kind of hunt and peck my way around a piano or whatever, but if they were to do this so I could, like, refine my skills, I am so there. If I could, like, you know, because I really enjoy it in Rock Band 3. I really do. Remember the keyboard main that they had for the actual keyboard? It was on PC? Yeah, I do. Yeah. I didn't own it, but... Did you ever play Rock Band 3? Of course I played Rock Band 3. I loved the keyboard mode in Rock Band 3. Yeah, and then there was Keyboard Mania, of course, many years ago in Japan, and that was fun, too. That was always my favorite of the Moana games, even though it was horribly neglected. Anyhow, let's go to Japan and check out some games coming out over there. Monster Hunter Frontier Online Forward 5 Premium Package on the Xbox 360 on the 17th. That is also, I guess, coming... I guess there's a bundle with Xbox Live Points you can get, too, I guess, for some of the transactions in the game. Well, I think Monster Hunter Online for them is actually a monthly fee. Oh, okay, so that's probably a points recurring fee. Dance Central 3 gets a Japanese release on October 18th. Darksiders 2 gets a Japanese release on October 18th, as does FIFA 13 World Class Soccer. Again, those are all Xbox 360 for the few 360 owners in Japan. Interesting about Dance Central 3, I'm imagining it's got to be the same song list. I don't think they localize for the area or whatever, so don't get excited if you're a J-Pop fan. I don't think there's anything to look for there, but interesting that they got such a quick turnaround. It is very disappointing that they don't have Wild Wild West like they do, or just Dance 4. On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 and FIFA 13 also coming there on the PlayStation 3 on the 18th. Let's see, going to some of the handhelds. On the Vita this week, FIFA 13 is there as well, and The Legend of Heroes Zero no Kisuke Evolution comes out on the PlayStation Vita. Just saying, if you haven't bought the Vita version of FIFA 13, you may want to hold off. Why is that? It's exactly the same as FIFA 12. Oh, I thought that was the Wii version. Both of them. Oh, no. Bastards. And lastly on the Nintendo 3DS, Project X Zone on October 19th from Namco Bandai. That's pretty awesome. Those are your Japanese release dates. Alan, would you care to take us to the land of all things Britain? Sure. And UK-ish? October 15th has The War Z, or The War Zed, coming out on PC. October 17th, we've got Serious Sam 3 BFE on Xbox 360 and The Unfinished Swan on PlayStation 3. 19th of October, 007 Legends on 360 and PS3. Dance Central 3 on the 360. Doom 3 BFG Edition on the 360, PS3, and PC. Madagascar 3, the video game, which I'm sure is going to be the best game released this year, because movie tie-in games are always phenomenal, on 360, PS3, DS, PC, 3DS, and Wii. Those big cross-platform juggernauts. RockSmith on PC. Skylanders Giants on Wii, iPhone, 360, PS3, and PC. Street Fighter X Tekken on the Vita. And that is it. Just a few more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer isn't here, so we're taking over. See what we picked in a minute. But first, Loki. Apparently, SingStar is going to be a free-to-play game pretty soon. Which kind of makes sense, because when you buy SingStar, you get some songs, but it's basically just a platform to buy more songs. If you look at Rob's library, that shit ain't free. Shut up. Hey, don't be a jealous hater, because I have SingStar Abba, which is awesome, SingStar Queen, which is awesome, and SingStar 1 and 2 on the PlayStation 3, which are okay. And how many songs a la carte that you've bought? Enough. Enough to have a party. Enough to entertain my guests when there's a SingStar. And I've been collecting them since I lived at that house with John. We don't really have parties here in the tiny apartment, but when I lived in the house with John where OLR was in the garage studio, we used to have SingStar parties, and we had a good time. And a lot of those I bought on sale, to be fair. I bought SingStar Queen at the local flea market for like eight bucks. How are you going to say no to that? And it was new. It was brand new, still wrapped. Apparently you still need the microphone, obviously, to play the game, but I guess there is a message now popping up on the SingStar games. They're basically saying the complete SingStar experience will be available as a free download very soon. And apparently they're going to offer that as a download, and then you buy the song separately, I guess. Which I think that's kind of cool, because if you think about it, they did something similar with the PSP version of Rock Band, where they had a demo that you can get, and it came with a couple songs, and then you just build your own rock band library. Instead of paying 40 bucks or whatever for the game, you can save that money and buy 40 bucks worth of songs that you want to sing. Maybe you don't like all of ABBA's songs. Maybe you only like a couple. You buy a couple ABBA songs, and you buy some Britney Spears or something. I'm sorry. Who the fuck is going to be satisfied with only a couple of ABBA songs? If only a couple ABBA songs is what it takes to satisfy you, get out of here. Maybe those people want to spend their money on Queen or something like that. Look, if you're on a limited income, then I understand. But you need to set up your monthly ABBA plan to get you on your path. Good idea for Sony? I think it's a good idea. Might as well. They haven't really done anything with SingStar in a while. I think it's a good idea, because it's going to get more exposure for people, and because the SingStar games don't really sell that well. I mean, they really don't. They don't? No, they don't. I bet they do overseas a lot better. They probably do overseas, but honestly, karaoke games don't do very well. But everybody's got a USB microphone, especially those wonderful Logitech microphones that they put in everything. They work on pretty much all systems. So you get one of those in a throwaway game, like Truth or Lies or something like that. I don't know. And you've got a SingStar mic. Well, actually, no, those SingStar mics are different. But still, I mean, you could find a bundle for SingStar for, like, dirt cheap somewhere. I'm sure that, like, a GameStop or Walmart or something has them in their dump bin. Just go looking for it. All right. Well, let's move on to one more story about, you know, this always pisses people off when there's content on the disk that they call DLC, and you have to pay to unlock it, which, you know, we started using the term pay-to-unlock content instead of DLC for certain things. Well, when it was discovered that Resident Evil 6 has some things locked away on the disk, everybody was like, oh, here we go again, Capcom. Pay-to-unlock DLC. But apparently Capcom announced that the things that were found on the disk, including no hope difficulty level and co-op for Ada Wong's campaign, these will be freebies, and they will be a free title update coming soon. So no word if they only made it free because they got caught. Or I actually, you know, all trolling aside, I can see the value of doing free DLC because it extends the life of your game past the first week, especially in the very busy holiday season where there are so many games competing for your attention. I can actually see the value of this. So, you know, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but good on Capcom in this case. It's just so they can release a gold edition of the game later on with the actual stuff unlocked already. That's what they did before with Resident Evil 5. Remember they had all that, like, PlayStation Move updates? Just reprint all of it and put it in the new gold box? We'll put it in the gold box and we'll sell it again and people will buy it. I mean, that's what's going to happen. Now it is coming out that there will be paid DLC, but it will not already be on the disk. It's coming later. So, all right. Let's move on to a time when there wasn't even a Resident Evil 1 yet. I don't think when this game originally came out. Maybe one was out. I don't know. There was. There was a 1. All right. But, okay, back when the Resident Evil series was good. There was no download content. That's right. There was no download content. When Resident Evil 2 was going to be on the N64. Remember that? Oh, yes, I do. I do. It's a classic game of the week. Dark Soccer. She ain't here again. So we've snatched her pick away from her and we've picked an awesome game in her place that we think you guys should be playing this week. And we gave it to Alan this week. So, Alan, what is your classic game of the week? Well, usually when I do this segment, I do, like, old Sierra Online PC games or, like, LucasArts. So I wanted to give consoles love this time. And I wanted to do something handheld because I don't think handheld gets that much love in this segment. So I chose Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Seasons, and Oracle of Ages for the Game Boy Color because they are super awesome. Legend of Zelda, Seasons, and Ages came out together, obviously, because you can play one, you get this huge, massive password code that you then plug into the next game and then you continue the story. And once you beat both of the games, so you play one, you get your code, you play the other one, then you get to fight Ganon, who's the secret boss, and then you get to see Zelda proper and you get the real ending. And one of the big deals about this game was the fact that Nintendo did not develop or design it. They let a subsidiary of Capcom, called Flagship, write and code and design the game and Nintendo simply published it. And I think that may be one of the first times Nintendo has ever let a blue chip franchise be in the hands of someone else. Now it's not that rare because Sega has done stuff and there was that Metroid game that was done by Team Ninja. This game came out in the US in May of 2001, which was the month before the Game Boy Advance console proper came out. So this is one of the last games for the Game Boy Color before that generation was phased out and the Advance took over. Some of the best Game Boy Color graphics that you'll probably ever see. And even looking on the YouTube, that looks pretty good. It's like eight colors, I think, on the Game Boy Color. Yeah, so if you play one game, some of the items that you get are upgradeable in the second game. There are a lot of little side quests and little... Look at these little cartoony cut scenes too for Game Boy Color. Yeah. So if you play both games, depending on which order you play them in, you can upgrade certain... Like the hookshot and bloom ring, certain items you can upgrade to a tier that you couldn't normally get if you bring all of your equipment and stuff over into the next game. In Oracle of Ages, there is a time mechanic where you speed up time or slow down time to get past... To solve certain puzzles in the dungeons or on the overworld to actually get into the dungeon. In Oracle of Seasons, you have a rod that will... If there's a river, you'll make it winter and the water will freeze so you can cross the river. Stuff like that. Was this the game that had the advanced dungeons or was that one of the other Game Boy games? That was Link's Awakening DX, wasn't it? One of them you could plug into the Game Boy Advance and then there would be this special... Actually, maybe it was the Advance Shop. I think it was something... Because you say this one... Because I remember playing it and this was right on that cusp of when the Game Boy Advance first came out, right? Yeah, it was a month before. So, you know what? I think it was this game. Because I think I remember playing it on the Advance and the Advance had some special little thing in it. I'm not sure about that. I think you're thinking of the re-release of Link's Awakening. Maybe I am. Somebody in chat will correct me. That's the lovely part of doing a live show. One of the awesome things about the Legend of Zelda handheld games is that... Nintendo, Miyamoto has even come out and said this. In the handheld Zelda games, they will allow themselves to do things with the franchise and with the mechanics and the story that they simply can't do on the console versions. Because the console ones are obviously the big deal. Now with Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, even Wind Waker, they still find ways either with the art direction or the werewolf mechanic. They're always coming up with stuff to keep the series fresh, but you're always going to have the three medallions, you're always going to have the Master Sword, you're always going to fight Ganon. There are these staple things that are always in those games. In the handheld ones, like Oracle of Seasons and Ages' Minish Cap, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, that's when they really get super creative with the world of Hyrule and the stuff that you can do. They usually introduce a lot of new characters that you'll never really see again in the handheld games. Link's Awakening, with the fish or whatever that's sleeping, that whole plot was inspired by Twin Peaks. Do you know it? Because you're a big Twin Peaks fan, right? Yes, I do. Yeah, so that's just an example of how Zelda really shines in a lot of unique ways on the handheld systems. Now, I did some research, and the Advanced Shop was Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons. It was a shop. It was not a dungeon. I think I called it the Advanced Dungeon at first. That's probably what confused you. When these games are played on a Game Boy Advance, there is a shop. They have two seed rings and a gasha seed. Depending on the game, it's either the GBA time ring or the GBA nature ring, while the other is a random ring. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's right. I remember it's right here in the article. Since this was so close to the Game Boy Advance release, if you played it on the Advance in addition to that shop, the graphics were also much improved. So they had obviously not Game Boy Advance quality graphics, but the color palette and the clarity of the pixels, they actually was coded onto the Game Boy Color cartridge to be read by the Advance. That's awesome. So, yeah, if you look this up on YouTube, try to find the Advance run-throughs. As far as how it played, again, it's Legend of Zelda. If you've played Minish Cap, Link to the Past, the first Zelda game, you know, overhead, big expansive map, you go into dungeons, you have to beat the dungeons in a certain order because the items that you get in the dungeon, the treasure is what you'll need to solve puzzles in the dungeon after that, and so on and so forth. The main antagonists, I believe, are Twinrova. I think the double witches could be wrong there. It's been so long since I've played this. But, yeah, there are these... The oracles are these ladies that you meet when you're transported to these new worlds. These games don't take place in Hyrule like a lot of the handheld games. So, yeah, they are in danger, and there's... Naru is one, and Din, I think, is the other one. So you rescue them, and then as you progress through, you beat the one game and you play the other one. And you do figure out finally how Zelda and Ganon and the Triforce factor into it. They're a lot of fun. If you're a big Zelda fan and you haven't played these, you're missing out. All right, good pick. Your classic game of the week, The Legend of Zelda, Oracle of Ages, and Oracle of Seasons. Two games for the price of one. Yes. All right, thank you very much, Alan. Good pick. I think Jamie would be happy. All right, well, that's going to do it for Part A of our show, but don't go anywhere. We've got plenty more show to come as we get back, including some rapid-fire news, the FUGO Question of the Week, and some interesting rumors about Miyamoto's new direction. And an event coming up appropriately named Fuck This Jam. We'll talk about that. It's not our event. It's somebody else's. We'll talk about that a little more when we come back after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. We are live with the 477th episode of our show here at vognetwork.com, The Voice of Geeks Network. And looking at the chatroom during the break there at live.vognetwork.com, looks like Bobby's talking to some of the people in there about his experience with the drill and some of the band stuff that he does. I know he does a lot of that stuff professionally. Little-known fact, I did marching band in high school, too. I played the clarinet and did a lot of those field shows. And it had me thinking about that video. And surely you all have seen this by now. It was all over Facebook. Even people I know that aren't that into video games were posting this. Did you guys see that Ohio State marching band show where they were doing the tribute to all the video games? Surely you guys saw this. Logan, you see this, Allen? No. You didn't see it? When they did the Galloping Horse, it blew my fucking mind. I know. It was really amazing, some of the stuff they were doing. Now, you know, having done field shows in the past before, and I'm sure Bobby can attest to this, too, I'm sure we're not the only band nerds that happen to be into video games and all that. I'm sure there's plenty more band nerds out there listening to this show. But it is a lot of work, because you not only have to memorize songs, but you have to memorize where on the field you're going. It's not the hardest thing in the world. I thought it was easier than memorizing lines for a stage play. But it's challenging. And I have even more respect for that video after seeing it. That was an amazing little piece. And it also made me super jealous that we didn't get to do that when I was in high school. Amazing. Jessica Harper from Understation Live is in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com and says, I was, however, the drum major my senior year. I feel like she's told me that before, and I forgot. And that's awesome, because I tried out to be drum major, but I wasn't picked. Somebody else was picked. I'm a drum major reject. And now look at me. I'm on a podcast about video games on the internets. Anyhow. Drum major reject. That'll be the title of my first album, Drum Major Reject. All right. Well, I'm glad Jessica could achieve where I clearly failed miserably. All right. I apologize again for my voice, you guys. I am kind of struggling through tonight's show. I've already had a hot cup of coffee and a throat-coat cup of tea, and it'll fix it for about 30 seconds, and then I go back to, My voice has got to scratch. So I will do my best. This is like the worst possible thing that can happen to a radio guy, but I will do my best to try to get through the next couple hours here, or not next couple hours, but next hour or so, of the show for you guys, because we have plenty more gaming news to talk about. And we're going to start off with some rapid-fire news, right, Loki? That is correct. So let's talk a little bit about this really cool sale that they've got on Amazon right now. It's a bunch of Square Enix games, and I think it's a great deal. It's 10 bucks, and you basically get Deus Ex, Human Revolution, Augmented Edition, plus the Missing Link DLC, Hitman Blood Money, Just Cause 2, Just Cause, Quantum Conundrum, Supreme Commander 2, and The Last Remnant. For $10. And the sale is running through October 20th. It expires at 11.59 PM Pacific Standard Time, so go get it, because, I mean, that's seriously a great price. Yes, this is a sale we were referring to in Part A, and I gotta say, kind of once, actually. Yeah, it's called the Absolutely Great Square Pack from Amazon. And these are all the PC? All PC. Yeah, The Last Remnant, which, you know, was their exclusive RPG for the 360, which was a huge pile of shit, if you have a good PC, it plays fine. So the technical issues that it had on the 360 are on PC, and you should actually play that game, because it's good, and no one would ever know, because it was so awful on the 360. So, overlooked, Square RPG. Agdeft in our chatroom says, Amazon won't let me buy it. I wonder if that's the Mexico thing. Maybe it's a deal that's only good in the US. That kind of sucks for those that are in other countries. I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. It sucks. Actually, you know what? It may not be available anymore. It says currently unavailable. Maybe it sold out. Maybe so many people jumped on it. And here's the thing, too. The DRM on it was Steam, so you were getting some sort of codes or something. For a lot of games. Oh, wait, wait. I see it right here. Actually, no, I'm sorry. It says unavailable, but then there is this buy and download thing. Let's try clicking that, just out of curiosity. Just come on. No, it will not let me. During some of Steam's really insane 99 cent sales, this happened with GTA 4 and Ballad of Gay Tony. They had a note. We don't have codes. We ran out of all our codes, so we have to contact Rockstar Games for 20,000 more codes. That could be the issue that's happening here. Well, they may have had limited copies, and then once they hit all the blocks, then... Well, that sucks. AlphaCananagram in chat is saying don't know if Loki said, but feel free to use the code S-Q-R-L-U-V-I-O to take $2 off any digital video games purchase. Code will expire when this product becomes available for purchase again. I wonder if that means Amazon didn't intend for this to happen or something weird is going on. I don't have that code either. Very strange. These bastards. Alright. I bet you're mad for waiting now. Check tomorrow. Oh no, I do see that. It says currently out of keys. Back in stock soon. $2 promo. There it is. Just give it some time and keep checking back, I guess. Great deal. Either way. Either way. Alright. And then, of course, we have to talk a little bit about some DLC and Sleeping Dogs. They're going to have quite a bit of DLC soon. Starting next week, they're getting some street racing DLC. It's going to add some new street races in the game, I guess, for $4. That's what's going to run you. It's going to have three new races across land and sea. And also, I guess, there's some new street racer DLC that they're I guess they're adding a new motorcycle as well. And a new outfit that boosts, I guess, defense against gunfire and accidents. Then there's also going to be some DLC on the 30th that's I guess it's sort of similar to like, they're kind of comparing it to Undead Nightmare for I don't know if there's zombies in it or not, but it's supposed to kind of tie in with Hong Kong Cinema. I guess the beginning, it's Nightmare in Northport. And it'll be some horror-themed thing that says with the DLC we can explore other aspects of Hong Kong Cinema. So, no idea what exactly that is or how much it's going to cost, but that's going to actually be story DLC that's going to be coming pretty soon. And last but not least, DLC for Borderlands, which by the way, if you haven't heard yet, that free DLC that if you bought the, or pre-ordered the game and you got the premier club or whatever, they actually released the extra character class early. So that came out last week, so that's pretty awesome. Another game I really need to go back and play some more. But first piece of DLC coming on the 16th, so this Tuesday, it's Captain Scarlet and Her Pirate's Booty. And that's coming for 10 bucks, or if you want, you can buy a season pass for 30 bucks and you get four pieces of DLC, so, you know, 25% off. And really, I mean, if you played the Borderlands 1 and played all the DLC in it, you know it's going to be good. So, I'm sure that the DLC will be pretty awesome. I'm still waiting to hear on how it goes and maybe I'll have to plunk down the 30 bucks for a season pass. Alright. Well, going into news on a game that I really should check out at some point because I did love the old series and I hear it is kind of a, you know, newer version of that. I just haven't had the time this week to pick it up, but it is XCOM Enemy Unknown. The revival of XCOM. Well, there's a pretty nifty Easter egg in the game that allows you to bring in super soldiers. You can put in certain names and they activate XCOM Heroes. I don't know, for some reason it makes me think of NBA Jam when you could put in certain combinations that would unlock Bill Clinton and Scorpion and shit. That was awesome. So, I don't know. But here's the type of people you can unlock here. Sid Meier. Ken Levine. I think that's awesome that they put Sid Meier in there. Joe Kelly and Otto Zander are apparently all super soldiers so far. Apparently the one little trick to it is that once you summon the heroes, the achievements are turned off. So if you want to go for achievements don't use this little cheat. But maybe once you've beat the game and got the achievements you want, go back and play as Sid Meier. For the lolz! Moving on to a Street Fighter movie that apparently is not being made in Japan. This is a Brazilian artist. That's pretty cool. Victor Hugo. He's a real big fan of Street Fighter and he wants to do this movie that he calls somewhere between next gen fighting game and Hollywood animated movie. He's teamed up with an animator friend to make Street Fighter 3. It's a fan flick and it looks really, really nice. Especially in these little posters. It looks even better than like Frankenweenie or one of those movies that's in theaters. It's a really neat art style. Kind of impressive that it's only these two guys. Even more impressive that Capcom hasn't shut it down yet but maybe the fact that they are in Brazil makes it complicated. Good luck to them. I really would not have brought this up because I hate giving this attention but it is a slow news week so I will quickly say PETA put out their little spoofs this week of Pokemon Black 2 and White 2. It was a little spoof game that they put out. Here's their statement. Enjoy this from PETA. Much like animals in the real world Pokemon are treated as unfeeling objects and used for things as human entertainment and as subjects in experiments. The way the Pokemon are stuffed into Pokeballs is similar to how circuses chain elephants inside railroad cars and let them out only to perform confusing and awful painful tricks that were taught using sharp steel tipped bull hooks and electric shock prods. If PETA existed in Unova our motto would be Pokemon are not ours to use or abuse. They exist for their own reasons. We believe that this is the message that should be sent to children. Now Pika Pii! I just want to remind you guys PETA is clearly trolling with this. Look at that statement. Over half of the statement had nothing to do with the game they were putting out. They used half that statement to talk about the whole circus and the elephants and all that stuff. It is all about attention. I mean clearly they play Pokemon. They understand Pokemon because they know about like the Pokemon world. They said if PETA existed in Unova they didn't say if PETA existed in the Pokemon universe or if PETA ruled Nintendo. These people know what the fuck they're doing by getting attention. Congratulations. You picked the right week to do it at least if nothing else. Alan. I played PETA's Cooking Mama game from Thanksgiving and whoever they contract to do their Shockwave games, some of them are actually kind of good. That almost is the reason why these things are worth covering because as much as they are trolly and it's like you just roll your eyes at PETA they are really high quality trolls. Yeah, because the Cooking Mama one was how to make a Tofurky in the vegan Thanksgiving. You click and drag the food ingredients. I'm like this is a pretty well done little Shockwave game. Do you remember playing on the Genesis ToeJam & Earl? Because I do. The sequel ToeJam & Earl and Panic on Funkotron are going to hit the PSN and XBLA online stores on November 6th and 7th respectively. I never played this because at the time I was at the age where I was really kind of butthurt. It's basically a 2D side scrolling platformer and the original ToeJam & Earl was like an overhead sort of adventure game. So yeah, if you're a fan of ToeJam & Earl and want some vintage Genesis nostalgia, pick that up November 6th and 7th. God of War Ascension which is the next God of War game because you know they're not going to let that franchise die off. The demo is going to be in the Total Recall remake. The one with Colin, whatever his name is. That comes out on December 18th. So get the Total Recall Blu-ray, play God of War Ascension and that is going to be the only way to get that demo until four days before the game comes out. I think like March 8th is when they're putting the demo on PSN and then the game comes out on March 12th of next year. And the graphics for it, just looking at these screenshots look really like disgustingly awesome. Very God of War-ish. Finally the game Injustice Gods Among Us which I will admit I don't really know much about. It's being put out by NetherRealm. They are has a DC Comics character in it. It's going to be Green Arrow. Who some people might remember like you know the show Supernatural which finally ended after like 11 seasons that had Green Arrow in it. It's the Green Arrow I think is best known. Wait, Supernatural's not done. Still on the air, isn't it? Oh, I meant Smallville. I'm sorry, Smallville Superman. And now there's an Arrow series on CW that like just either it just started last week or it's starting this week. Oh, is it a spin-off of the same actor? Yeah, I think they're trying to make Smallville Lightning Strike twice. Yeah. So yeah, Green Arrow is going to be a character in Injustice Gods Among Us. There you go. Yeah, and it's the Justice League outfit I believe from the Cartoon Network show. Shane in chat says, different actor sadly. Oh, well that's just unfortunate. Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat, I want to go back to the PETA thing for a minute. Remember, they're delayed so sometimes it takes time for them to comment on things. Tigerclaw in chat says, I wonder what PETA thinks of Tokyo Jungle. Wouldn't they hate the fact that you play as animals eating other animals? Again, this is proof that they're trolling because you know obviously Tokyo Jungle is the game to take issue with but they know that Tokyo Jungle is a niche thing. No one curr about Tokyo Jungle. But what's a game that everybody talks about? Pokemon. Anyway, I'm giving this story far too much attention. I just wanted to address that comment because it was worth commenting on. I don't think they really have a problem with people or with animals eating other animals because that just happens in the wild but as long as it's not people eating other animals, that's really the issue there. So by that logic, would they be okay with people eating other people? Yes. Because they're only for the ethical treatment of animals. Nothing about people. Oh, okay. Just wanted to make sure that was clear. Unfortunately, doesn't exist. Well, you know, we need a people for the ethical treatment of people. That's what we need. That's the foundation we really well, I sound like such an asshole because it sounds like I'm saying fuck animals and that's not really what I'm saying. But I think we should have a, you know, what about how we treat each other? Isn't that important as well? Anyhow. Again, giving it far too much credit. You know what deserves more credit on our show? Our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities. It's the Fugal Question of the Week. Take Facebook and Google and put it together and you get Fugal. And the Question of the Week this week. Kind of a little play on the fact that I've been on vacation for a little bit. Everybody's done it at some point in their life or another. What is the worst thing you've missed in real life so you can stay at home and play a video game? Did work get in the way of a Final Fantasy launch? Did you stay at home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of going to your friend's birthday party? Excuse me. Pick up. Bad time. Worst nightmare for a radio person. Did you stay home to raid on World of Warcraft instead of going to your friend's birthday party? Let's go to some of the answers on Google. Starting with actdeft. I don't recall missing anything serious for a video game. I have come close though. Like almost missing class to get a Dreamcast on Black Friday. Remember I'm from Mexico and we don't have Thanksgiving here. I think the most serious one was when I offered to help in a DDR tournament the same day I had agreed to help some friends with a political party's elections. But forgot they were the same day. Since I'd agreed to the former first, my friends didn't mind and let me go to the tourney though. So no harm done. Sean F. replied on Google Plus. Yes, there are people on Google Plus. I have to say that every week. And said I wish I had a terrible secret to reveal. But I think the worst I ever did was I took the day off in 2005 when I got a PSP at midnight release. Wipe out pure and luminous. Good times. Indeed good times. Let's go to Facebook and get some answers to the question there in our Facebook community. Starting off with Where'd the post go? Here it is. Critical Myth says I've been far more likely to miss things like company Christmas parties to see Lord of the Rings premieres. But a friend of mine skipped his own performance review to stand in line for the 360. He still got promoted. Skipped his performance review at work to get a 360. That's a pretty good one. He must have known he was going to get a good review and could get away with murder with his boss. Degenerated Johnny says I was leading my first raid in Molten Core during Vanilla WoW. Unfortunately the raid was during the time I was supposed to pick my mother up from the airport. She was coming back from a trip to her homeland of Scotland. This resulted with her being stuck at the airport for two hours. As punishment I had to act the role of being her personal chauffeur for an entire month. It wasn't all bad. It allowed us to have some good times with each other. This proves that sometimes gaming experiences can help push families closer together. Even if it was through force, right? Haseo Sumeru Excuse me, sorry guys, the voice is going. Haseo Sumeru says it's funny that you mentioned the Final Fantasy launch thing because way back when I first started playing Final Fantasy X, I faked getting sick so I could stay home from school. I went all out, had a heater in my room, aimed at my face to fake the fever and water bottle with ice water for cold sweat. And it was worth it because I managed to make my way through the Zanarkand ruins all the way up to the final fight, I think. Dark Tetsuya says I actually skipped school the day I got the original PlayStation. Ironically ran into my high school tutor at the time who didn't seem to mind. Yes, I did graduate. And lastly, Chiggers on Facebook says, never happened. In real life is always more important than a game. The game will always be there, but real life experience only happens once. Oh, you. What a party pooper answer. I'm just kidding. That's something we probably should remember. Anybody in here with a story to share? What's the worst thing you skipped out on in real life to play a video game? Allen? Um... I did some all-nighters when I was in high school where I just didn't go to bed. I just played a game and then when it was time to go to school, I went to school because when you're 16, 17, you can do that shit. Your body's like, fine, I'll be up for, you know, 36 hours until eventually you can crash. But as far as missing, I mean, I when the PS2 came out, I got up, I went to bed at like eight in the evening, got up at one or two in the morning, walked, I think, two or three miles to Target, got in line at Target at like 4 AM. There was already a line. I got PS2 I think 38 out of 43 so my timing couldn't have been any more flawless from wanting to actually avoid camping the entire night out. And then I went into work. Once I actually bought the thing, I think I was in the office by, I want to say 10 or 11 in the morning, but I already cleared it with my boss the night before, so... I've never been I've never done anything that scandalous. I've never, I don't really think I've taken a, have I taken a day off work to play a game? I don't, I, if I did, I honestly do not remember. I took a day off work to play World of Warcraft. Yeah, because Pandaria, that used to be, yeah. But to be fair, I ended up having a Disneyland trip and I would have taken the day off anyway. True. So, but the, I guess my real answer would be that I cut a lot of class in college to play Final Fantasy 7. It was real good and I was really into it, okay? I was more into it than some of my classes I had at the time. You weren't really into college that much anyway. I really wasn't, so I, I skipped a lot. I probably cut class to stay home and play Puzzle Fighter 2 with friends, so, or excuse me, Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo or whatever it was called. I probably cut class to stay home and play that with friends and it was worth it, I don't care. Low-key. Um, I skipped work, well I took time off for, um, Grand Theft Auto, well, recently it was, well actually it wasn't that recent, but Grand Theft Auto 4, to try to get 100% on everything so I could get the keys to the city, which I technically did within the time frame that they had in the whole contest thing, but they only had a limited amount of keys and it wasn't registering the information correctly. There was a huge delay, so, I unfortunately didn't get the keys to the city, but um, got the achievement for 100% though. I took time off work when Final Fantasy 11 came out. I remember that, I was so jazzed for that game, I totally took the day off when that came out too. That was years ago. I didn't skip work, I just took the day off. So I guess it's not as bad if you planned it in advance, right? I'd probably take the day off work for Grand Theft Auto 5. In the future. In the future, planning for 2013. Alright, we have some more news stories for you guys, and then we'll get your Skype calls here in a little bit. Alright, so there's this new patent from Sony for a controller. Right now, at least in the diagram, it shows a Playstation Move controller, but apparently it's a controller that allows the user to feel temperature change. So, for example, the controller could get hotter, like if your gun overheats, or you get hit by a fireball, or you're in an area where there's fire, or something like that. Or, if you're in a icy area or something. It's kind of like a temperature feedback, as well as how they have the force feedback and stuff. So, neat! I don't know if it's necessarily something that they're going to be implementing into a Move controller or something like that soon, but it's kind of cool to have this technology around for whenever you may use it in the future, for some new controller or something. I don't know if it'd be a big deal, like, you know, a controller got cold and went into an icy area. It'd be kind of, haha, that's neat! I'd like to leave it cold all the time, you know. Sometimes your hands get sweaty. Maybe it should detect whether your hands are sweaty, and then cool off. There's a third-party company idea right there. If Playstation had indie games, somebody would release an indie game that's called Hand Warmer. And then the sequel, Hand Freezer. You know who needs this technology? Microsoft for the Xbox 360. Why? When it detects it's getting hot, it gets colder. So the system doesn't crash. Oh, okay. I see what you did there. That's good. It's just water-cool everything. I don't know. Well, it wouldn't be hard for the Playstation controller to get hot. They could just put in there whatever they put in iPhones, because the iPhones get really hot if you're, like, using it too much. When it's really straining for a signal, I notice it gets really hot. That's how they could do it. Maybe they could implement this into the iPhone. You know, when you piss off Siri by asking a bunch of stupid questions, it'll just melt down into your hand. You'll just... I'm gonna burn your hand now! Wrong answer. Punishing games. Kinda... dumb. This would be something that you'd add to, like, haptics later on, but let's get the haptics thing out of the way first, you know. I think more people would be interested in touching things rather than, ooh, it's cold now. First off, actually, challenge number one. Getting people to buy the move. That's challenge number one. Challenge two, implementing, you know, temperature change in there, and having people be interested. And seriously, how is temperature change gonna come in handy in, like, Just Dance 4, or, like, I don't know, Archery in Sports Champions, or... Maybe this is why the last Guardian got delayed. Maybe he's guarding temperature. I don't know. Maybe it's because it's gonna be a launch in another system or something. Alright. Or maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's just somebody had the idea and it was like, you know what, let's patent it just in case Nintendo's thinking of something. Well, this is an interesting little rumor that's going around. Take it with a grain of salt, because it's spawned from a NeoGaf post, but you never know. Sometimes where there's smoke, there's fire. Sometimes. Rumor is, Shigeru Miyamoto is expected to leave Nintendo's EAD division by December. How many times has his rumor been around? I mean, seriously, there was another rumor that he, this was like a couple months ago, that it was the same damn thing. Apparently, Miyamoto is not happy, because the EAD general manager overshadows the content that's created by new producers and directors at Nintendo's largest gaming division. New Super Mario Bros. producer Takashi Tezuka is rumored to take his place. Other changes, boy, where I said there's smoke, there's fire. Where there's wank, there's a lot of wank. A major shift in Kyoto development sources involving three research and development buildings. New groups and new producers being announced for EAD Kyoto and SPD Kyoto. A Tokyo expansion of EAD and Mashihiro Sakurai possibly joining EAD Tokyo. New division led by Miyamoto with younger staff focused on smaller scale games. Miyamoto's departure inspiring new IPs for the EAD Kyoto division. And Cliffy B going to EAD Tokyo. I added the last one myself. I added that one myself. Come on. I had to throw my own wank on there too. Why not? Everybody else is. Maybe that's a list list. Nintendo wank. Best Nintendo wank. Come on. Let's make up a Nintendo rumor. Come on. Come on, Alan. Make up a Nintendo rumor. Total legit source. Come on. Wii U will use points like XBLA and have DRM. Yes, it probably will because there's this thing called Wii points that already exist. I know you've never played a Wii. Come on, Loki. Add your own Nintendo wank. It's fun. Nintendo wank. Let's see. I don't know. This is tough. It's tough to come up with something stupid. People pull this shit out of their ass all day long. I know, but I have to be selective when I pull out of my ass to make it sound a little bit more legitimate than the other people that pull stuff out of their asses. That's the thing. That's why I was giving it some thought there. So, Loki, the man who works for the distributor, what is Nintendo going to do next? What are you posting to me after tomorrow? They're going to fake another shortage on the goddamn Wii U system to create an artificial demand. That's not a rumor. Oh, no. Did you hear what? No, this actually didn't make our show but did you hear what their fucking excuse was? There was a fire in a production plant, I guess, that lowered their amount of units that they're going to put out by a million or something. Isn't that the same excuse they used for the gasoline prices going up? Yeah, there was a fire in a production plant. Goddamn, Wii U's were there. Why did we store them next to the oil? AlphaCananagram in chat wants to remind me they did get rid of the points because the Nintendo 3DS eShop does use regular money for currency. Yeah, they got rid of those cards. Whatever. You know what they're going to do? I have a Nintendo rumor. Okay, yes, thank you. Their online integration is going to be really mediocre. These aren't rumors! 3DS Micro. It's small enough to fit in your pocket, man. And to take inspiration from Apple, they're going to make their next 3DS super wide so they can have yet another attachment for the stupid Have you seen the... was it the LL and the XL? Have you seen the... I was like, okay, okay, we made it bigger. We could have put a thumb pad here, but no. We're going to have an even larger thing that's going to attach to it and make it even wider than it was. Is that really happening? Yes, it's really happening. Is it out yet? I think it's coming out in Japan if it's not out already. It's very soon. They have pictures of it. And it's not Photoshop. It's like, this is an official thing because, you know, you want the larger... I mean, seriously, it's just... Let me just add another, like, half of a laptop right here and I'll put just a giant, like, analog... I should do that. You know, make a project. I have this analog stick that's just, like, the size of my hand. It'll look like that Tetris game at Golf Land with the gigantic joystick that you use to move the pieces. Have you seen that? The Sega Tetris? I'm surprised no one's actually sold one of those. It's like a, you know, home thing. Could be fun. It could be fun. Alright. Let's move on. Alan, do you have some legitimate news for us? Kickstarter. Everyone's favorite controversial crowdsource. I said legitimate. It's going live in the UK on Halloween. It's gonna be a part of the same site. There is not going to be some, you know, Kickstarter-UK.com. It's just Kickstarter. But if you're within the UK, you can now, you know, put up your project. Obviously, the currency available is going to be listed in pounds. Doesn't say anything about euros here. Yeah, you can set your goal and your stretch goals and I imagine if you're in the US and you want, you see something awesome over in the UK, you can bid on it like you can in any other Kickstarter. But, yeah, they got the payment and the those sketchy, you know, legal financial stuff sorted out. So, yay, UK, you're getting Kickstarter. I'm sure they're all very excited. That's all. That's all I got. There you go. I guess they got their legal stuff worked out, but there was already, you know, the other. So, whatever. Have fun getting addicted to Kickstarter or hating on it or whatever side of the fence you choose to be on. As diverse as we are on this show. Have fun with that, UK. It's a borderland, so a lot of copies. How many copies? Oh, shit. 1.4 million copies. That's a lot of copies. That's a success. 60 bucks a pop. That's a lot of money. Exactly. And, of course, you know, also that, um, I believe it sold I can't remember what percent more than 234% more than the first game. So, at launch, that's pretty awesome. Not so awesome, NBA Baller Beats, which sold 3,000 copies. Total. Wait a minute. You mean there wasn't a market for basketball and music fusion games? Basketball, yeah, exactly. Basketball, you know, it's a Kinect game that requires you to have a floor that's, you know, that you're not in an apartment and that the floor is, like, hardwood or something. Here's the ironic twist. Now it's a collector's item when it sells that few copies. No, it's not. That's like saying that the eye of judgment is a collector's item. It's not. It kinda is, in a way. The, uh, Borderlands, that is only hard copies of the game. I think this is saying, uh, digital distribution is not in that figure at all, so that's even more awesome for them. Yeah, that's awesome. Unfortunately, the digital version of NBA Baller Beats doesn't exist, so I can't use that to inflate the numbers there. Bobby Lackwolf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com wants to remind us NBA Baller Beats had 50,000 Twitter followers. Remember that whole thing? So how did they only sell 3,000 copies of the game with 50,000 Twitter followers? It was... Do you mean to tell me they had fake Twitter followers? It wasn't 50,000. It was 500,000 Twitter followers. Yeah, it was 500,000 because I think they have 100,000 for, like, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 or something like that. Yes, they bought their Twitter followers. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me that they bought all those Twitter followers? Yes, they did. There was an article on the Penny Arcade... 449,631 followers and they sold 3,000 copies of the game? Yeah, because all those guys are really legit. And you know what's great is even after all that they're like, we didn't buy those followers. You know, people are really excited about this game, okay? Really? You know what game sold better than NBA Baller Beats? President Cat. The Eye of Judgment. The Eye of Judgment. Sold better than NBA Baller Beats. Oh, I feel like this is a game on, like, the $25,000 pyramid or something. Family Feud or something. Name a game that sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. Ready? Go. Barbie Horse Adventures 2. Probably not yet, but we will hit that mark. Bungie Ferret Tossing will sell better than NBA Baller Beats. Tokyo Jungle will sell more than NBA Baller Beats. Oh, I'm sure it already has, yeah. Let's see. Secrets of the Mystical Unicorn. The game with the pink anus on Steam has probably sold more than 3,000 copies. I'm trying to think, what was the worst game I can think of that's a paid game? Worst game ever. Night Trap sold more than NBA Baller Beats. I was going to say Bullet Witch sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. Master Chu and the Drunk Nard Who on the NES probably sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. Hell, even Steel Battalion, that last one that came out, sold more than that. And it was fucking broken. Beatmania sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. Burn! Pop and Music on Xbox Live Arcade or what was it called? Beat and Groovy sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. Do you remember that song that was really obnoxious and horrible last summer, the Louie Louie Gucci Gucci Fini Fini Prada Basic Bitches Wear That Shit So I Don't Even Bother. Her album came out. It's the worst album sale that sold like, it's not quite a record but it sold 3,900 copies in its first week. That's more than this game. Creation. What's the single called? Gucci Gucci. Gucci Gucci. Hold on, I want to look this up. It was just the single. Please don't play it. Do you really hate your listeners that much? No, it was just a single last year but she actually put out a full album with that song and no one gave a fuck but more people gave a fuck. Okay, so more people gave a fuck about this song. No, that's not it. Oh, this one. Okay, more people bought this CD than bought Baller Beats. Wait, what's the chorus? This is so awful. This is really badass. This is too long. Where's the chorus? I can't make it to the chorus. You probably picked the worst part of the song, Dev. Whatever. So there you go, the worst part of the worst song. Worst part of the worst song and that, and yeah, and Dartusuya says that song was probably in NBA Baller Beats. Let's see, Act Dev says more people bought ET on the 2,600 than NBA Baller Beats. Jessica Harper said Britney's dance beat probably sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. Oh, Rama. Oh. Burn. This, oh. Ouch. Rock Revolution sold more copies than NBA Baller Beats. That's a fact. Oh, ouch. Oh, you win. You win an internet. This story's over. Marissa. I love Marissa. I really do and she's in our chat room and she just said, this bitch just rapped about Adderall. By the way, does this still work? I just want to point this out. I want Marissa to know this because this is how bad Marissa needs to come back to the show. Okay, you know how Google, Google has the predictive search feature, right? Okay, I want to show you something. Go to Google and type orange lounge radio and oh, of course, the one time I do it, oh, you know why? Because I'm not doing global research. But I swear to God, I did this the other day. I typed in orange lounge radio and in the predictive search, the number two thing that came up said orange lounge radio Marissa. Not orange lounge radio chat room, orange lounge radio Loki. It was orange lounge radio Marissa. Swear to God, I was looking at this yesterday and I was laughing my ass off in a good way because I love Marissa. But it's just funny that, well, how long ago was it she was on this show? Alright, anyhow, let's move on. An appropriate story to follow that last story is about a game design jam called Fuck This Jam. It will, uh, I have no, who is putting this on? It's on a website. It's called FuckThisJam.com. Well, that's appropriate. Oh, okay, here it is. It's organized by Rami Ismail of Vlambeer and independent designer Fernando Romalo. Uh, Fuck This Jam apparently was basically an inside joke. It came out of a conversation that they had when they went to an arcade in Austin, Texas. It will take place from November 9th through the 17th. Well, why would you care about this besides the cute name? Well, because the participants in this little contest or whatever, they will be tasked with creating a game in a genre or style that you would ordinarily have disdained for. So, in other words, let's say you're the type of person that's like, you know what? I hate sports games. You know, I don't want to play sports. I never play sports games. Then your job in the jam would be to design a sports game. Or let's say, you know, I hate first-person shooters. You gotta design a first-person shooter. I hate retro games. I hate role-playing. So, I actually think this is a really neat idea to encourage people to get out of their comfort zones because this is where some of the best ideas come from. And you know it's gonna lend itself to crossover potential. I bet something out of this ends up on Project Greenlight or something. Just you wait. Just you wait. Good luck to everybody that's participating in that. Fuck this jam. Alright, well let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick our favorites out of the mailbag and read them live on air. Dark Soccer is not here to read them tonight. But Alan, being such a good sport, has volunteered here to read the emails. It probably helped that there was only one. Yes. Now there's one email and I really empathize with this person who was kind enough to write it in because when I write stuff I'm often very verbose and go on about something I care a lot about. It's a Windows 8 rant email and this person did say how long it is. And it is long enough that we're not gonna read the whole thing on the show. It's not personal. So it is from 13X Forever. And he writes a Windows 8 email and he says, Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you have an empty mailbox problem so I finally took my time to write about that Windows 8 hate show two weeks ago. First off, I love that our show is now a relay to Bobby as well as just like blast us with an email and hope Bobby gets some splash damage from it all. It's an AOE attack. Exactly. Hello OLR Crew and Bobby. I heard you have an empty mailbox problem so I finally took my time to write about that Windows 8 hate show two weeks ago. Yeah, this mail will be long so maybe you should skip it for the show. Sorry. Also, I have to apologize in advance if I trail off topic or go on rumble for too long. And then, first of all, I highly recommend to read Paul Allen's take on Windows 8 with a link. Interface changes and Rafael Rivera's post on the Minecraft certification debacle and optionally his own rant or the person who wrote this in on Google Plus on this topic. And then it goes on and unfortunately we can't read all of it but he did include, thank you writer, a TLDR summary. Smart idea when you send in a long email. Include the too long, didn't read portion. So TLDR summary. You should really try it for yourself before judging. Sometimes to build something new you have to break something old and people will hate you for it. All of the hate on the internet for Windows 8 stems from a few articles published by ignorant writers to get more clicks for their websites. Desktop experience is the same as for Windows 7, only much more polished. Plus you have Metro which is mostly optional. Notch is fighting some illusory threats of software freedom on commercial OS 2 in most unconventional ways. Yes, Windows 8 will sell worse than Windows 7 and everyone will point and laugh. You're probably biased Russian neighbor 13x forever. So I'm wondering maybe if I'm on the vlog article for when the podcast, this episode goes up maybe we can include that email. Perhaps. On the forums. On the forums. Yeah, I would say make a long post on the forums. But I will tell you this. I did read the email in its entirety off air. And it was, you know, the TLDR does sum it up pretty good because even though it was through kind of some fanboy filter, I did sense a little bit of that in there. There was a good point that was raised that is essentially don't knock it until you've tried it. You know, many people are sitting here bashing Windows 8 just because they've seen some screenshots and they don't like the fact that there's something different. That they're presenting the start menu and it's different. And the kind of, again, I'm paraphrasing here and this is the message I took from it was essentially change is gonna happen. Change is inevitable. Change has to start from somewhere. If you like the start menu, didn't the start menu start somewhere, right? So why is everybody hating on this when many of them haven't tried it? Granted, some have. But many haven't and they're just looking at these screenshots going oh, I hate this. I hate this because it looks like an Xbox. And I say this being guilty of being someone who usually crawls up Valve's ass at every opportunity. But it wasn't Gabe Newell but someone, there's the whole debacle with Notch bitching about it. But someone at Valve, not Gabe Newell basically said we've messed around with the Windows 8 kit and he was like, personally he didn't want to design software for it because he thought it was a big steaming turd. So whenever someone from Valve says something everyone like Valve says Windows 8 is garbage and then it just echoes through the whole internet which is not really what they said. Right. The whole game of telephone happens. Yeah. So, interesting. Now I will say there was also a portion of the email that really addressed the whole Windows certification thing and the fact that I think people are reading too much into it and it's not that Microsoft wants a cut. That was a huge part of what the Valve complaint was too. But it's not that, just to be clear, it's not that Microsoft wants a cut of it. It's that Microsoft wants to certify it and I'm assuming it's similar to how they might certify like I know because I've done some of this development at work, like it's harder to run macros and even like access in Word if you don't like certify your content because of the illegitimate stuff that's out there. So like imagine expanding that bubble to include software. That's kind of where it's going. Isn't that kind of like the Nintendo official seal of equality where they had to play every game even if it was bad to make sure it was good enough? They don't do that anymore because of course the Wii is the biggest shovelware console in like 10 years. Well and also people got around the Nintendo seal of equality. Like it worked for a while but then when it was because Atari and Tengen as it was won that lawsuit where they tried to stop that from happening. They were able to keep Tetris off the shelves because that was a particular circumstance but they were not able to keep those cartridges off shelves. I can't remember if the lawsuit was Tengen specifically or if it was one of the other companies like Color Dreams or you know one of them back in the day but Nintendo tried to stop it. They lost so there was nothing they could do about it. So I think at that point they kind of gave up. But yeah Nintendo, Nintendo put those locks into place because they were trying to prevent another video game crash. The other big big big thing they did on the NES remember this. Yeah because a lot of the games on the 2600 weren't even designed on proper development kits. They were trash. Yeah. Well publishers could only put out three games a year. If you paid for these development kits or whatever you could only put out three games a year. So that's why, well you had these publishers start to put out, just invent subsidiaries to get around it. That's where Ultra Games came from. Ultra Games was just Konami. That's all it was. It was just Konami and it existed solely to put out you know more Konami games on the NES like Metal Gear and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Ultra Games. Yeah. But it was Konami. So anyway that was a total tangent that that emailer was not expecting at all whatsoever but there you go. So at the end of the day let's go back take a step back. What about the course part of the argument I think what I took away from it was don't knock it until you've tried it. Alan is it fair? That's fair. You haven't tried it so should you be knocking it? Yeah. Windows, well it's, I made a joke once that Windows OS's are like the Star Trek movies, the original ones that every other one is a piece of shit and the other, every other one is really good. Because XP Professional I ran for years because it was rock solid. When Vista came out they tried to drag gamers over to Vista by saying if you want DirectX 10 you have to use Vista. I'm like DirectX fine it's 9 for me I'll stay on XP. And now 7 is so fucking good I can't imagine why I'd want to leave 7. 7's great. And the bummer is like it's not like you can just like try 8 out and then go back. Oh yeah it's a total I don't think you can. No I don't think you can down rev Windows. So it's either all in or out. Alright well thank you very much for the email even if it was a little long. Hopefully we covered the points to your satisfaction and we you know either way we still appreciate the other perspective. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. We get to disagree sometimes. Alright let's get into the FUs of the week. Uh Loki why don't you start us off tonight with your FU. Uh an FU to uh e-machine shop for their fur I'm not working nicely with uh Google Sketch unfortunately. The wonderful painstaking process of creating the part of the beat gear pad or whatever um it came out nice so they can't import it at all. So and I tried recreating it in their stupid cat editor and it sucks. So fuck that. Um you know despite all the stress I went through in the past week I had a pretty good weekend so I can't complain too much although I will say FU to my voice. And FU to the fact that I'm getting old. That part kind of sucks and uh yeah I did I didn't just do rock the something keep in mind I didn't just do Rocky on Friday. I actually helped out with another performance piece that um some of the gals on cast asked me to do. Uh just play a really quick walk on roll in and I did it so I had to do that last night. But it's part of that performance I'm supposed to die on stage which means I have to take a stage fall. Yeah totally bruised my knee during doing that yesterday. So that part sucks. So FU to getting old where my bones are old and frail and I can't take falls like I used to be able to. Wah. Alan you're FUs of the week. Um things are going pretty well for me. I got a second day off this week. Um which I wasn't expecting. So the apartments all clean. Uh I hate I get paid Friday. And you know sometimes when you're like really really really broke waiting for that payday to come up. I'm kind of like that now. Sometimes you can avoid it sometimes you can't. Alright. There it is the FUs of the week. Two more stories and then Twitter topics and the Skype line. So Loki. Alright. So there's going to be some price discounts pretty soon for the Xbox 360. Coming in the form of their holiday bundles. They're actually going to have two bundles out that um actually look pretty cool. There's one that's going to be the Connect 4 gig um well actually I guess the Connect 4 gig um bundle. And they have a 250 gigabyte just regular bundle. Um for 250 you can get a uh holiday bundle which is the 250 gigabyte Connect. And those are usually 350 bucks. And I guess the bundles have different games packed in. They've got DLC codes for everything from Forza 4 um Connect Disneyland Adventures Fable 3 Halo Reach. And also um they're going to have I guess codes for a digital copy of Skyrim. I actually saw that in one of them. Um let's see here. So yeah you can get a 4 gig console for 250 or just a regular um system without a Connect bundle in there. Um for 250 and that comes with Forza and Skyrim as a digital copy. And then also they have a 4 gig Connect um bundle that's going to have um what was in there? Connect Adventures and Connect Disneyland Adventures. Well that's kind of stupid. Why would you buy the old one? I don't know. For whatever reason I guess I'm marking down the old bundles in case you know because it doesn't seem very smart to have the old bundle with less stuff in it for the same for you know more than what it is with more stuff in it. But apparently they still have it at the same price. So you can get the holiday bundle without Connect Disneyland Adventures. I guess if you really hate Disney and you just you know fuck it I'm not getting anything extra um you can do that. So those are three bundles that are available. Um I guess now. So you can check that out. And then um some older holiday bundles too. They've got one with Halo Reach and Fable 3. That was the old one. But I guess that's not available anymore. Cool. No surprise there. Price drops in time for the holidays. And for Wii U. Maybe that it's yeah true competition there and maybe to you know just encourage a few more copies to move after Thanksgiving. Honestly though I mean if you don't give a shit about Connect which honestly nowadays you probably shouldn't give a shit about Connect Lisa's console generation. The one with Forza 4 and Skyrim is a pretty good deal. I mean those are pretty awesome games. Good tip. Alright one more story for you guys and this is about what could have been uh Blizzard had once planned a version of Diablo for the Game Boy Color. Can you even imagine that? Ew. Right? Like Starcraft on N64 you remember that? Now this was uh in a statement from well I shouldn't say a statement but it was more of an interview of Blizzard biographer David Craddock uh in speaking with Shaq News. It was called Diablo Junior. It was intended as a single player only prequel to the original game. Taking a page from Pokemon's book the team wanted to release three cartridges each packing a different hero in the warrior rogue sorcerer vein as well as items that players would have to trade for in order to collect. Development was only with a handful of staff. They started working on Diablo Junior after the release of Diablo 2. It could have been the Game Boy Color or the Game Boy Advance or both I guess just due to the timing of all of this. Um Diablo Junior was ultimately put out to pasture because of the steep production costs associated with developing handheld games. Uh I guess there is a book coming out or a project called Stay Awhile and Listen. It's an unauthorized history of Blizzard based on the testimony of 80X employees. This gonna be good. Wow I didn't know somebody was working on something like that. That sounds like it's gonna be amazing. Uh apparently there was also another Diablo 2 expansion that never saw the light of day. Uh there was um uh it was gonna have guild halls for multiplayer clan meetings and two other character classes that also came out of that. Weren't there also a bunch of around the time Warcraft 2 between Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 there was gonna be a bunch of orc based side story games? I remember seeing clips of that yeah. And the animation was very, they kinda look like the Zelda CD Phillips CDI games. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Same style. They did they did. I wanna know what happened to Starcraft Ghost. I hope we get the low down on that. Yeah. Ooh. I like this. The uh unauthorized look. Or they're really awesome franchises from the 90's they haven't touched. Like Lost Vikings. Or Blackthorn. Or Rock and Roll Racing. Didn't they also do the shake, rattle, and roll? Was that Blizzard? I don't know. They got more franchise. Snake, rattle, and roll. Who did that? Is there is more out there than wow and Diablo Blizzard. Or they could come up with something new. I know that's a uh whatever. Whatever Titan is. Whatever Titan is supposed to be completely unique IP. Oh I'm an idiot. Snake, rattle, and roll was just straight up rare. Why did I think that was Blizzard? Am I really that dumb? I guess so. Whatever. Shut up. Alright let's go to the Skype line at 1877 game OLR where our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is open right now. And while we're waiting for some calls to come in we will do some tweets. Tigerclaw sent in a few tweets tonight. See in here I thought it was a slow news week and yet we've got more stories coming in thanks to Twitter so I appreciate that. Tigerclaw on Twitter with a story EA apparently accidentally gave away thousands of free games. Yeah. How the hell did this happen? They had a code that was I think it was for reviewers or something like that for Origin where it gave people $20 off. Yeah it said it was a thanks for completing a survey and it allowed them to download a free game from Origin but the code could be used by anybody. It was an unlimited use code. That's the problem. I'm reading it here on the story. This code is not secured. Someone made EA lose money they're gonna have to commit seppuku in a conference room. Oh my gosh. Alright. Apparently it ended up on Reddit. Alright let's go to the phones. We got somebody waiting. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? It's Shane. Hey Shane. How you doing? I'm good. How about you guys? I'm good. What's on your mind? So I want to talk about a little game called Mass Effect. I have never heard of this game. Why don't you tell us about it? Okay anyway before the new multiplayer stuff came out and the mega DLC stuff got announced Mike, I think it's Gamble posted something about how the upcoming DLC is kind of like the shape of things to come and I'm wondering if this DLC is kind of pointing at a more massive multiplayer Mass Effect game. Because now with the introduction of the Volus class. Here we go. Mass Effect MMO. Hold on. I'm justifying it. Alright. With the Volus class apparently it's pretty much just a support class like I mean you can still kill things and be really awesome but it's primarily for support so if you've got a support class your vanguards can take hits like really well and everybody else can do you know shooty things why not something in the vein of like a PSO style game where you have centralized hubs you can still do like massive story missions but it's just all like the multiplayer in Mass Effect 3. Okay. So okay sorry. Run this by me again. How is this going to impact the single player side of it though with the expansion? It doesn't. They were saying that the stuff that's coming out is kind of like the shape of things to come for the series. So you're talking more the DLC that came out this past week and not so much the Omega DLC? Correct. Oh okay. I don't know why but I was saying when you started this whole thing I thought you meant the Omega DLC and I'm like I don't see where that's going. Okay but yeah I get it with the Volus support class and all that. Allen? Yeah I made a comment to Rob earlier that even if the Mass Effect MMO never happens pretty much as limited of a model as it is the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer might be the closest that we ever get simply because if you have a favorite race with the exception of the Elcor you can pretty much be everything now. And who knows if the Elcor and the Hanar don't show up sometime down the line. I could see something happen. Also a Volus. I have one if you want to. We can do a match together after the show if you want to see how they play. Would be terrible support for a Vanguard because I couldn't stay close enough to you. They can't hop over cover so they have to actually run around the map. That's kind of adorable in a really weird way. So yeah if a Vanguard biotic charges and fucks off I'm going to have to run to your ass to refresh your shields and that's not going to work. And that's all I do as my Vanguard. I just fly around. But you with my Sentinel worked out alright actually. Yeah we did. We duoed what? Wave 4? Wave 5? Yeah now my Sentinel was only level 4 so that was pretty good. Yeah it was collectors too right? Yeah it was. Which are super fun. They're bastards. Commander Shepherd just joined our chat room and said Hi I'm Commander Shepherd and this is my favorite Mass Effect podcast on the Citadel. If only. You jerk. Alright. It'll happen eventually. Is there anything non, well actually let me ask you this question because whenever people bring up Mass Effect podcasts in chat Black Wolf likes to chime in and say there's not enough content out there to substantiate a weekly podcast. That's a lie now though. It's totally a lie. That's a valid answer because every like there is fan fiction there's fan works like art, music, there are books that have been out, comics that have been out, multiplayer updates that come out. Always speculation going on for the next games. There's enough content there for weekly episodes. For sure. Well then you need to produce a pilot sir and prove everybody wrong. But how am I supposed to do that and play Pokemon in Mass Effect and wow. Alright. And watch Once Upon a Time in Walking Dead. You just gave me an excellent opportunity to transition away from Mass Effect for a minute because you've been playing Pokemon Black 2, White 2 and I know that you are a almost 30 year old playing Pokemon games. You even, one of the original VoG articles is about your love of Pokemon and how you know you're a little old for it. So how are the new games and why do you still love this series? I'll never not love this series. They're just really fun RPGs and the Pokemon for the most part are adorable and who doesn't want to collect adorable things? That game was really fun. I played it. They're good. They contract good programmers. They really are good. No, there's just, I don't know. It's just fun. In fact I'm going to see my friends up near Kansas City this weekend and we're going to have a Pokemon tournament. I was just informed and I was like oh heck yes and they're my age too and they're all excited. Alright. I love this comment from Frisbee in the chat room talking about Shane's Mass Effect podcast I'm assuming. Frisbee says there's fan fiction, fan art, fan wank, fan dango, etc. There are Skyrim podcasts that are still going just because of all the mods that you can talk about. Alright, alright, alright. BlackWolf says five weeks in a row. Five weeks in a row. You got to have a show that's got five episodes and then What if I make five episodes in one night and then spread them out over five weeks? Some people do that. You don't say that's what you're doing in advance, dummy. That was hypothetical. Why would I cheat like that? Alright. As I write this down. What else was I going to ask you because you brought up, oh yes, with Pokemon I know you play in a lot of WoW. How's pet battles going for you? I have stopped pet battling because I'm trying to level things and get gear but it's like a terrible addiction and I'm trying to cut myself off cold turkey at the moment and I still think about it every so often and when somebody posts that they got a new pet I'm like I wonder how that would be in battle but I'm just not doing anything with it. Before we let you go for the night is there any message you want to give to Horde tanks out there that might be listening? That's what I was going to say anyway. Glad you brought that up. So if you're a Horde tank preferably a paladin or a warrior and you would like a fun laid back raid group that wants to do content while it's current, please please please server transfer to Proudmoore and get a hold of somebody in the guild Malevolence and we'll find you a home and we won't make fun of you much, I promise. Alright. That's it. Anything else before I let you go? Probably not. Oh, except I was very sad because Alan you talked about Kayden and Shepard fanfic I hadn't read yet and I don't know where to find it. I think I can dig it up. And now I don't have any fix saved to a folder on my hard drive I just know what time my user wrote it. I don't have any fix but I definitely have fun awesome pictures I found that aren't porn. So I have to make that distinction before it gets a little out of hand. As long as no genitalia is showing it's not porn. Oh, there isn't. No. There's none whatsoever. I think that would be weird anyway to have. Alright. I'm ending this conversation before it gets awkward. Bye. I'll keep it awkward. Bye. 1877 GameOLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call. I think there was another Twitter topic. Do you have any last minute stories Loki while I bring this one up? No. I had the EA one but somebody took it. Somebody took it. Well we got another call coming in so hooray for that. Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this? Hey hey it's Rama. Hey Rama how you doing? Ow. My feet. Ooh you're calling in to talk about New York Comic Con I bet. More or less I was actually calling in to kind of agree with the whole pirating thing because even in my fandom we have to deal with it. We call the people that bootleg the anime and so forth we call them spoiled entitlement bitches. Ooh. And just because they're spoiled and entitled? They feel that because it comes out in Japan they can download the fan subs and watch all the episodes and decide not to buy it when it comes released here because they feel that I already have it why should I go out and buy it? Okay I can feel that because I was about to say when you started your thought I was like uh oh cause I was kinda like that for a while cause like and I've admitted to this in the show in the past I have downloaded games that were released in Japan only because I feel if the game companies aren't gonna bother I've also done it with games that were only put out in Europe before they were announced for the America because my thought is if the game companies are not going to put the effort into putting the game out here I'm not gonna pay those import fees and mod my systems and all this stuff or whatever just to uh play the game you know so uh I you know at least could cut the cost out of it and play the game anyway now to be fair uh I did this with Dance Dance Revolution games that came out of Japan but when they released I mean I'm guilty of doing that too and when I released the or when they released the American versions of DDR I bought every single one of them so did I so you know to be fair so it's a little different than your scenario because you're saying they watch it and then when they release it in America the Americanized version or I mean I guess not really the Americanized version but the you know whatever they end up putting out here they fuck off but also on the same token they do it because they can and let's say the series just comes out in the US and the DVDs are like 40 bucks for an entire box set people will go and buy that flight on a box set rip the episodes and put them online they'll even put the full disc online and people will find them and download them because they can well and we that's the same thing with games right some pirates do it because they can yeah and it's like I said if Halo 4 comes out at $19.99 it'll still be pirate because they want to save that $20 and that same person that doesn't want to drop $19.99 on a game will go buy a spindle of blanks to spread to make copies to give to the French what's this comment you just made in chat Alan that's somewhat on topic with all this oh I was just saying back in the early late late 90s early 2000s I used to order fan subs from anime all the time I don't know if that's what he's talking about specifically Sailor Moon yeah partially and it's become where the companies will contact the fan servers and ask them not to continue with this a lot of them will be like sure no problem some of them are like you know what fuck you we're going to continue to fan sub because we do a better job than you can yeah well a lot of times when a fan sub got a cease and desist that was great news for the community because the only reason why the company was doing that is because we bought the rights to this show it's coming out next year and then the community would be happy because yay they were finally getting it Alan to also go with that same thing happened when Full Metal Alchemist came out since Square Enix pretty much helped put it out in Japan when Funimation picked it up Square Enix told them you got to translate this pretty much word for word you can't mishap anything here or there they're working on setting up the C&D so all the fan sub are selling them oh they can't do this, they're like sure we'll lay off, we'll step back some of those fan subbers will go behind their backs and continue fan subbing the series under a different title and the C&D goes to them and so on and so forth and so forth well Rama I don't want to burn all the time talking about piracy well no it's fine it's a good conversation but I want to hear about a New York Comic Con because I hear Travis was there too and Critical Myth I think was there too I didn't see Critical Myth but I did front it to the one and only Travis Donovan did you? was that the first time you met him? yes, he freaked the fuck out when I walked up to him with my big old afro hahahaha amazing so what did you do and see in New York Comic Con? what was there to do? I mostly went for the cosplays the exhibition hall was ginormous there was a few indie games there but big games that were there was the Capcom booth showing off Darkstalkers Resurrection and then there was the Halo 4 booth and then further down there was Square Enix's new Tomb Raider game oh wow I didn't realize they were going to be there that's cool and unfortunately I wasn't able to check out any of these games because Comic Con decided to give just me, press, and the rest of my staffers no press access at all don't and the lines were like 3 and 4 hours long I couldn't even get up in there in time to try out the Wii U aww that sucks sorry to hear it it is what it is I'll just try to get over to Nintendo World later this week well since I know you're all about the cosplay which I know the listeners can hear more about on Anime Jam Session Tuesday nights on VOG what was some of the good cosplay you saw? believe it or not I see some pretty good My Little Pony cosplays oh god Comic Con is just comics, manga pop culture everything all together that's what it's come down to I did see a couple of good Master Chief cosplayers running around and the most popular one was Scott Pilgrim oh nice yes very cool Black Wolf in Chat says Rama's met two VOG people for the first time in the span of a month because you met Bobby last month huh? yeah when I finally got to the hotel and rested up he shows up in his awesome car and we head on over to Waffle House and chilled as long as I'm still your favorite oh you know that oh and then Travis is going to make you take that back on his show later on is that always the case you know? PAX East is coming up you know one thing we didn't bring up on tonight's show I just realized but we should probably address well here's the thing we can talk about it PAX East badges went on sale and then we can mention oh but they're already gone don't get me started on that I am so pissed and aggravated about that whole situation why? didn't you get a ticket? yeah my brother got me a ticket and when I got home I got Jovi's ticket I got her a Friday, Saturday, Sunday badge that was the only way but the people behind PAX let people buy as many badges as they want and then they went directly to eBay that's why the three day ticket sold out in 24 hours oh lame that's pretty bad I mean if you want to go I'm telling you you're better off getting a Friday, Saturday, Sunday because I don't know about you I don't think you want to go on eBay and try to drop three bills on a three day badge yeah that's not good it really couldn't have happened on a worse week for me I didn't buy a badge I am crossing my fingers and toes that our existence can justify at least one media pass exactly I will be more than happy to interview developers and have vog articles and coverage on the shows and YouTubes and all that stuff just hopefully that'll work out because otherwise I ain't going but this was just like I spent a disgusting amount of money on Rocky Horror, just ask Allen although it might be a little bit of a stressful point but I spent a lot of money on that shit so I didn't have money for badges Rob, I understand Rocky Horror that's your fandom, that's your baby that's your pride and joy I can't say anything about that because if it was something of a hobby of mine like that I would have done the same thing I spent a lot of money on vog too and these podcasts every podcaster on this network spent a lot of money on what they do but we're not saying that in a pity us we are begging for money we just say it in a it's our hobby, it's our passion, it's what we do we do it for what we love go back to PAX East real quick before I move along they're not even putting the media passes registration up until February that is so weird I know so weird, but alright it is what it is, it ain't my con it's a good con, when the con gets here everybody that gets to go will have a good time BlizzCon ain't any better with the way they do it look, the main the most important part is the fact that I secured two rooms for everybody so we have a place to stay, that was the most important thing and we got hotel space from Thursday to Sunday you're the bomb, if I'm able to get a media badge I'm gonna be like, Rama and in that case when you come down, me and Jov\u00e9 we'll head on over to the airport and pick you up oh, you're the bestest we try alright, I should let you go so we can go wrap the show alright, take care bro, thanks, bye bye see, Rama's got my back cause I'm his favorite, we already established this take that Bobby, just kidding Bobby's gonna be at PAX too I know he's going, so who knows, that's kinda cool because since PAX Prime is the same weekend as DragonCon at least we get to have a little bit of PAX in our lives I mean, I shouldn't say that PAX East is less than PAX Prime I like the timing of PAX Prime with the exception of the fact that it's the same weekend as DragonCon I like the timing of PAX Prime a little more than PAX East but I know we'll have a good time at PAX East if I get to go anyhow, I think that's gonna do it I think that's gonna do it for the Skype line tonight cause those are some long calls but thank you guys so much to those that called in if for whatever reason you weren't able to get through tonight do send us an email cause we're always short on emails mailbag at orangelaundry.com one more Twitter topic here I want to read about and it has to do with Wing Commander so it's worth mentioning weren't you a fan of Wing Commander back in the day, Alan? I know I was well get this, and this is another tweet from Tiger Claw Chris Roberts announced a new game called Star Citizen didn't we talk about those earlier? did we? I forgot about it if we did it was in chat, I don't think we talked about it on the show I think it was on Bobby's show at the end, but it wasn't on our show anyhow oh well, then I'm saying it twice, it's Wing Commander, deal um Star Citizen from Chris Roberts is happening it's a Kickstarter it's a crowdfunded game but you know it's already raised $455,000 with the crowd funding, that's crazy so it's probably going to make at least a million so you can look for the return of Wing Commander even though it's not called Wing Commander but it's from the same guy and obviously it has a spaceship based name so it's going to be the next evolution of that series hopefully it will turn out better than the movie you know, I almost backed that Obsidian one I realized that the game's not coming out until 2014 so I was like, fuck that that is a long way away not gonna wait alright that wraps up, if you have no other stories for us, Alan, I don't know if you have anything I don't have any links or anything but I have something quick for those who are in my age group who remember a show called Siffle and Ollie on MTV yes! they're back, and they're on the Machinima channel reviewing fake video games, and it's like they never left I don't because I think this happened a couple weeks ago when the first one showed up, and I don't remember if we brought it up on the show or what but yes, it is hilarious because in the mid and late 90s, you know, MTV did stop showing a lot of music videos for original content, but back in the mid and late 90s, that content was actually good because there was liquid television and all this really weird indie shit that kind of honestly paved the way for a lot of the shows on Adult Swim where you're like, do I need to be smoking weed to be watching this shit? what the hell is this? Siffle and Ollie was one of those shows and yeah, they're back Liam, the guy who invented them and wrote them and does the voices was on the Nerdist podcast and he was talking, Chris Hardwick was like, I wish the Nerdist channel had snagged him up Siffle and Ollie are on Machinima Nice. They're good for lulz Let's see, episode 1 has 92,000 views, not too bad Not too bad Alright, well thank you very much That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Thank you guys who tuned in and support Orange Lounge Radio tonight, whether it be through the podcast or on Stitcher or wherever, and if you're tuning in live, a big thank you for sticking through all the upsies and downsies of the stream, it looks like we've been okay for the past hour, people stopped complaining in part B, so I guess it was just for 30 minutes there or so, it was a little rough but thank you guys for sticking with it, we really appreciate you guys, you troopers If you like what you hear here at Orange Lounge Radio remember we don't ask for your money to do this shit all we ask is help spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio, tell a friend or two or leave us a nice review on something like iTunes or a recommendation on Stitcher or TuneIn or any other site, wherever you heard of this show, there are plenty of other people looking for something like this, so word of mouth is great Let's go around and get everybody's final thought Alan, as always, thank you for pinch hitting his host tonight, especially on such short notice, really appreciate it, glad we could have you on even if you do live here, and you know you usually get picked on anyway, but you're always great to have on.
