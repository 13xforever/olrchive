Tonight, October 21, 2012, Xbox will soon unfriend two of their social applications.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
More Sega games are being re-released as download titles, and a PC game ships without the necessary activation keys.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 478, October 21, 2012.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you guys to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome back, big welcome back to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello, you've been out for two weeks.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You went from like really good stuff to really not so good stuff.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Disneyland, let's focus on Disneyland. How was Disneyland?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was gay.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm glad you had a happy time.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, we didn't actually go into the park on Saturday because our good friend and listener got into a little bit of an accident.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But he's okay, right?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He's okay.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
When you first told me that I was like, oh my god, but he's fine, right?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The car came out a little tire poppy.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Things we learn in our lives, cars are just cars. People are people.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Exactly. Dan and I had a fantastic time regardless.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And when I came home, now I'm going to get into the horrible part.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When I came home, Shermy was sick.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
She wasn't eating very much. She sounded a little raspy.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And she kept going into the den and just sitting there.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And we thought that maybe she just couldn't get back up the step because of her hips.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So finally I just picked her up and brought her into the computer room with me and took a towel out of the dryer and wrapped her up in it.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So she was all warm and she loved it. She was a-

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A purrito.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A purrito.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And she even curled over and with an ear poking out.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've got pictures on Facebook. I'll repost them in the chat.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But it was, she finally started doing better and started eating again.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I, you know, put her back in her room and, you know, made sure her towel was in there with her.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And, you know, I let her come into the computer room whenever she wanted.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And Tuesday, like around midnight or so, she, well actually, yeah, it would be Tuesday.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She was half in the laundry room and half out in the hall.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And she batted my foot.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And so I stopped and petted her.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And, you know, we had a good cuddle and she purred. She was a little wheezy when she purred.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was like, I was the old lady kitty, you know.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Round two o'clock, I was actually about to go to bed and I went to look for the cat to pet her good night.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because I always pet Jeremy good night.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And she was in the living room dead.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just laying on her side and I couldn't tell if she was breathing because she was so fat.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I went in and she was still warm and so I couldn't really tell.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But the moment, there's like a muscle tone that you can feel the difference.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And yeah, so, um, Shermie, I'd have to say she probably died around 1.30 in the morning.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Based on her temperature and everything.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the fact that, you know, she had, rigor mortis doesn't set in for like a few hours anyway.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So, um, yeah, Shermie died.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She was 15.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Actually, we redid the math and she was probably 16.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because I got her when she was a year and a half old.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So, which would have put her birthday in October.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, she was 16.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, just so some of our newer listeners know and I do at some point.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let me just say hello to Tech Master Loki.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So, you don't have to sit there all quiet and unintroduced.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But obviously, Jamie had a pretty busy week.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, I know she wanted to talk. So, hi, Loki.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hi.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, going back to what's going on with you, Dark Sakura.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
In case the newer listeners don't know.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Because, you know, we've been taping where we're at now for about a year, almost now.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Probably a year and a half.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But we used to tape the show at your house.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We've actually taped the show at like five different places in the ten year history.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But we did tape the show at your house.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And you, obviously, you had Shermie.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And Shermie was pretty notorious on the show for sleeping at my feet and so forth.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Her bed was under the table.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And you would sometimes put the mic down near her and say,

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What do you think about that, Shermie?

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And she would actually go,

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Her hair goes,

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Exactly.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Or a,

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, yes, this does affect the show in many ways.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And, of course, there was a very infamous moment that happened at one point on the show.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That I want to bring up a clip of here.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And I really want to thank Dark Tetsuya for finding this clip for me.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But this is a clip from, I think he said it was episode number 357?

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is old. This is old. Here it is.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, what's that, Jamie?

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Nothing. I was talking about Shermie.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shermie just crapped.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, did she?

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That was her review of the show.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Nice.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That was us talking about the tester.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And Shermie notoriously took a poo on the floor and gave her review of the show.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, it was like her secondary poop spot was,

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've told people this before, Shermie had arthritis in her hips.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And so when she could manage to pee in her box,

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
she just couldn't poop properly in her box because she couldn't actually physically get in her box.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So sometimes she would just wait till people were around and take poop in the hall.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Look, I have shat.

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To call attention to it.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But what was funny is that like after Dan picked up Shermie and put her,

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
we actually put her in her bed because we couldn't keep her bed, you know.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She wore it out actually and put her in a box and Dan had the box on the back porch

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
because it was, you know, really early in the morning.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And he said that she was laying in state on the back porch and found poo on his shoe.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It was her last thing.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that was her last act.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Her last act was to crap on Dan's converses.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And then Dan let me sleep in the next day and he went to have her cremated.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because actually in Citrus Heights, if a pet is under 15 pounds,

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
then you can just throw them in the dump.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And he's like, the moment he told me that, I freaked out.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I knew he wouldn't do it, but I freaked out.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's like, I'll take care of her in the morning.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The fuck you will. I can hear you in my head having that fight.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And so they actually, it was like a communal cremation and they scatter the ashes in the foothills.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I was like, well, she's with other people's, you know, loved pets.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, a lot of love for you in our chat room as well.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Critical Myth, RIP Shermie.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Orange Rite, RIP Shermie.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Act Deaf, you shall be missed.

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
DDR dollar bill, still want to say sorry about Shermie.

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
City Vampire, I'm sorry Dark Sakura.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Dark Tetsuya, RIP Shermie.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Black Wolf, Shermie had amazing parents.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So, you know, lots of love from the listeners as well.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So sorry. I know it's, I know it's hard.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's okay.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, you know, and I had, we had a feeling that it was coming because I mean,

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I really felt like she was winding down, but I didn't think it was going to happen.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You know, a week after, you know, I get back from Disneyland.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Sure.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But what a lucky damn cat.

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What a lucky damn cat because you guys rescued her and she has,

141
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
she's not only loved by you and Dan, but look at all these peeps on the internet.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll tell you.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Most cats aren't so lucky.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll tell you what was funny too is that I was actually, because you know,

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
last, basically when I wasn't here Sunday,

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
since I had cramps so debilitating, I could not walk.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I mean, it was literally,

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I felt like someone had put my girl bits in a vice and, you know,

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
was trying to get orange juice from them.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
La la la la la.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I had, I ended up just sitting down on the floor, you know,

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
cause I couldn't move and it was the most comfortable spot.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And Shermy patted right over and she liked to sit in between my legs for some

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
weird reason and put her head on my thigh,

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
which I've got pictures of her doing it and sticking out her tongue and being

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
cute.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And, um,

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
she just sat in my lap like that for like an hour and we just hung out.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And well, you know, not to be, not to be morbid,

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but maybe she knew, you know, they know, you know,

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
when a cat knows that he or she is going to go, they,

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
they stop eating, they go to the same spot over again.

165
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And I was getting that feeling with Shermy.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's why the first time I picked her up and brought her in the computer

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
room with me and she was like, Oh, okay,

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm fine. But she was funny.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She wouldn't eat her regular cat food,

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but she'd still eat the treats from my fingers.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have video of that too on Facebook of her eating treats and making the

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
kitty wants nom face.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And so my baby, well, we're not going to get another cat.

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, I know that's the number one thing people want to ask kind of like,

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
when are you going to get another one? But it's, you're not ready, right?

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you're not ready, you're not ready.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah. And like I've had people offer me, you know, rescues and,

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and I'm perfectly fine. You know, I would love to take in a good rescue,

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
but it's also, you know,

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and I hate to put it in terms like this, but are you going to,

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you know, immediately replace your cousin if they die?

182
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to go to the store and buy a new cousin.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Or if one of your friends, you know, she's,

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
she's a member of my family and maybe it's, you know,

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
some people just like, Oh, it's just a cat. You can get another cat.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm like, but they have their own personalities and they,

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I had her for 14 years. Sure. And it's a teenager. Yeah,

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
she will. She's a whole lady. Really. Let's see.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
14 years ago was PlayStation one, right? Yeah. It was about that era.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dreamcast. That's when there's some Dreamcast are coming into your house.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah. Sure. Me used to, um, to sniff at the VMUs. I remember that.

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But, um, I mean, you know, she, uh,

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
she's a good cat. Well, yes, it is a video game show you guys,

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but sometimes, you know, she's named after a video game to shut up.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's true. She is named after a video game. Who is sure me for those that may

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
not know. Well, um, she, uh,

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
sure me was one of the characters in the king of fighter series,

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the one with the dancer type with the hair in front of her eyes.

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But when we got sure me, um, the adoption paper said Sherman, I was like,

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not even my cat Sherman need a little dinner.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She would become the size of a Sherman tank. But, um,

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
so, uh, and I wasn't necessarily going to name her after Sherman from,

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
you know, uh, Mr. Peabody.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So she'd go back in the way back machine. But, um, she,

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
we were like, well, we need a good name for her.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And so sure me popped up and it seemed to fit her.

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You know, she wasn't, she was graceful at one time,

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
one time and I'm going to go AFK a minute.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So it's fine. Um, at some point go say hi to the chatters.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They have a lot of very kind things to say and I think will help. Um,

211
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
but thank you for sharing the story. And, uh, you know,

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
if you do a show for 478 episodes, we're on that 478, you know,

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the listeners start to start to get to know you.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We start to get to know them and we want to share these big moments.

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And we liked Shermy. We love Shermy. Oh, come on.

216
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She was, I remember when she actually,

217
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
cause she would sit on my feet sometimes.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I remember when she actually got out of her box and sat on your foot out of

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
her bed. So, uh, Duke Nukem in our chat room puts it very well.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Video game podcast or not. Life isn't all about video games.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Sometimes stuff like that happens and intervenes for the games.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And we all understand. No, I know you guys understand.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm saying that mostly for the benefit of the new people who might be here.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You know,

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
LR for the first time because you know,

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
every week somebody is going to hear it for the first time.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Like what is this show? I just downloaded.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
All they talk about is dead animals. Ah, but it's,

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
it's much more than that guys.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Hopefully that story kind of tells you, uh,

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the family that we've built up here over the years. So Shermy,

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Shermy is my baby. Yeah. Especially,

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and I'm just to share a little personal thing. I mean, I,

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I Dan and I've been trying for a couple of years to,

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
you know,

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
share a little bit of the story with you guys.

237
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I Dan and I've been trying for a couple of years to, you know, conceive.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, mostly I've been doing the work because all right,

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
we'll leave it at that. Yes. We, we all know what you mean.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I hate when people go, we're pregnant when really the wife is pregnant.

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You're not carrying that baby dude. Shut up. Yes.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But he has to put up with you. Yeah. Am I right? Am I right?

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah. But, um, but I mean,

244
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Shermy was pretty much, you know, if without that cat,

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think I would have been a big wreck. So, and now I'm like,

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't want any kids. I just want more cats,

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
but I'm clearly not going to get another cat at least until after we moved from

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the house, which will be after December. Understand. And I'm gonna,

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and I'm gonna be a rescue just to give a little a plug here. Um,

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the, uh, animal outreach, um, out here in California,

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
they're actually in Placer County. They are a no kill shelter.

252
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's where I took Donut or bat cat or Bruce, whatever people want to call him.

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There's a little kitten I rescued from the dumpster outside my synagogue. Um,

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
they are no kill shelter.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They get animals fixed shots and take them to pet smarts to have them adopted

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
out. And, um, I would say, uh,

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
anyone in the Northern California area, give them your support.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you're going to get a cat or a dog, um, go through animal outreach.

259
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
They're really good people. So, uh,

260
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
black Wolf in our chat room says, for those of us without kids,

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
our pets are our kids.

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I put up just as many pictures on Facebook of my babies as my friends do of

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
their babies. I think that's a really good point. So when I,

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
when I come back, I'll spam chat with pictures of Shermy.

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Sounds great. Or, um, we need to know our pet community of some sort.

266
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Maybe I'll make a, uh, let's, why don't we have a tumbler, a pet tumbler,

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
pet tumbler. You figure you, you, you work out all them specifics and we'll,

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
we'll work that. We'll name this episode cat shit.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Raginator says we should dedicate this episode to the memory of Shermy.

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Absolutely. Cat poop. Cat poop. What?

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We'll name it cat poop.

272
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's probably take it.

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Did you hear what Raginator said? We should dedicate this episode.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Fuck yeah cat poop.

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
All right. Anyhow.

276
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Shermy used to crawl into bed with me too.

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We are at our box Springs broke for awhile and Shermy would crawl under the,

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
cause Dan and I use separate covers cause we're both cover hogs and she'd

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
crawl under and lay her head on my shoulder.

280
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And when she saw that I was awake, she'd start purring.

281
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And so she was my alarm clock.

282
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Act definitely in our chat room says pets a gram. You know, there's a good,

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
there, there's a good point to that. Um, without deviating too much.

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I finally did the sheep thing and I got an iPhone five over the weekend.

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Jamie's husband sold it to me.

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Hey, you know what? My four, the button was broken, the camera was broken.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So I haven't had a camera on my phone for like a year.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So what's the first thing I did with my iPhone five?

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Take cat pictures.

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
We downloaded Instagram, took a picture of Morocco and the kitty bed and put,

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm back.

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So, so you decided to purchase another phone from a company whose phone broke

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
in a couple of years.

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes.

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Awesome.

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Well, I didn't, I admittedly,

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I didn't use a case or anything protective with it and that was,

298
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that's a long story, but uh, yeah, it's kind of my own fault.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Get an OtterBox.

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Funny enough, I am, uh, uh, Alan bought one for me.

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Good, because OtterBox is, seriously, I'm, I'm on my second.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
OtterBox is not because the last one broke.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It was because actually the, uh, rubber surrounding it broke and not the, uh,

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
thing itself.

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
All right. Let's, let's get into video games a little bit.

306
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Before we get to our gaming weeks, we usually have a kickoff topic.

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Obviously we've already been talking a little bit,

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
but let's have a game related kickoff topic.

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Loki, I'm going to put you on the spot because you put up this very cryptic

310
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
tweet over the last week and obviously I perked up because it had the word

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Disney in it. So Loki, I don't know if now's the time you can tell me to F off,

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
but what is this tweet all about? You said Disney universe?

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Disney infinity.

314
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, excuse me. Disney, Disney infinity. What is Disney infinity?

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Disney infinity is a new property from Disney.

316
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's coming out next year in the spring or summer.

317
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Um, it's going to start tying in with all their movies that they come out with,

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
um, animated and stuff, including rereleases record Ralph. Uh,

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
no, it's like I said, next year. So next year's, Oh,

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
cause like they're going to release,

321
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
isn't little mermaid on deck to be rereleased and I don't think that's the next

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
one. Um, I think it's cars actually. Really? Okay. Yeah.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I think that's the next Pixar movie to be done like in 3d or something.

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But, um,

325
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
basically cause I don't know too much about it yet and there's a lot of

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
speculation, um, to what it is. And I mean, I know a little bit,

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
but, um, it's basically their version of Skylanders.

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So it's a game of some sort. I assume some sort of venture game,

329
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
although I don't really know what it is,

330
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
but it's got figures that, you know,

331
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
kind of work with some sort of device to be able to play as those characters.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But this is Disney we're talking about. This is not just,

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
it's a made up spyro, you know, made up characters that had Spyro in it,

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but now it doesn't even really have Spyro in it. It's going to be, you know,

335
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
well known franchises. So they're starting off with like, um,

336
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
some weird stuff. You would think it's like Mickey mouse and all that stuff.

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Maybe those are in like the starter kits or something like that,

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but it's basically, uh, the cars characters. Um,

339
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
there's also pirates of the Caribbean characters and,

340
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
um, what else was it?

341
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Later on in the fall, they're going to be doing stuff for, uh, Frozen,

342
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
which is their new animated movie. Right, right.

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's their big movie for next year.

344
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I didn't realize Wreck-It Ralph is the one Disney classic picture this year.

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
When we were talking about it last week, I didn't realize that,

346
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
but I did some research after the show and like Disney tends to put out one

347
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
animated classic a year. Last year it was the redo of Winnie the Pooh.

348
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This year it is Wreck-It Ralph. Last year was, um,

349
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Tangled. No, Tangled was two years ago at this point because technically it came

350
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
out Christmas of, uh, the year, the year before. Hmm. Yeah.

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Last year was Winnie the Pooh and this year is Wreck-It Ralph and next year is

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
this Frozen. Yeah. So Frozen and, um,

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
they've had some other stuff. Uh,

354
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
some of the characters I did see that they mentioned, Jack Skellington, um,

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Mickey from, you know, the whole, uh,

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sorcerer's Apprentice stuff. Um,

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
they said like Sorcerer Mickey or something like that. Well,

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
as much as like, I might want to sit here and roll my eyes.

359
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It does make a heck of a lot of sense for Disney to cash in on that.

360
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I mean, obviously, you know, you, you, you put the nail on the head.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Spyro and Skylanders say what you will about the game and so forth.

362
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It makes them an assload of money when you don't even know these characters.

363
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You, nobody has any attachment to the characters.

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And, um,

365
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it's like,

366
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
it makes them an assload of money when you don't even know these characters.

367
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You, nobody has any attachment to these characters.

368
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
These characters were made up for this game.

369
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Spyro being the one lone distant exception, but I don't even,

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
he's not even mentioned anymore,

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
nor on the cover of the next and put Spyro side by side with Mickey mouse.

372
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I mean, come or J or Jack Skellington or,

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
or any of the characters and the power of the people that, you know,

374
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
you think people, you know, are,

375
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
are consumer whores over Skylanders characters.

376
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You do not even understand how many consumer whores there are for anything

377
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Disney. If you look, I mean, Disney did have that game.

378
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Maybe that was the one that was called Disney universe.

379
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I did have that game last year that was, you know, it was, it was okay.

380
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I mean, it wasn't like gonna win any best game of the year awards or anything,

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
but for a family game, you pick up, go it, it served its purpose.

382
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It was fine, you know,

383
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
so I could totally see that type of engine and that game taken on this,

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
you know, cause that game was set up,

385
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
it had a very little big planet esque element to it where you could kind of

386
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
dress the characters up. And so far, I mean,

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
it wasn't as detailed as little big planet, but like, um, you know,

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
tiger call on chat saying no Tron characters. Well, this is not yet.

389
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is only, they only have, you know,

390
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
the first and second wave stuff announced.

391
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So for me Disney universe did have the Tron character,

392
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
how little big planet actually had, they still could do that stuff.

393
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's just, I mean, they think about it,

394
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
like they probably have a Tron movie in the works.

395
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I know they have another Tron movie probably in a couple of years.

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And so if not an animated movie or something to cash in on that,

397
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that animated series is pretty awesome,

398
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
which I guess it restarted recently and I have to go catch up.

399
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Did they, uh, did they renew it for another season? I hope so.

400
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't know if it's a new season or if it's the second half,

401
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
like the fall season or something like that, but yeah, it's still going dark.

402
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Dark soccer. You said when you were at Disneyland,

403
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
you saw a lot of the Skylander stuff, right? I saw like a few things.

404
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I thought that was interesting cause you know, it's weird.

405
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But it might've been downtown Disney.

406
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, okay. You do see a little more bleed over in downtown Disney.

407
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That makes sense.

408
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But I think it's interesting.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I mean, it'll be cool at the same time though.

410
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I really hate dealing with Skylanders.

411
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's more of a, it's going to be all these pieces.

412
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's an internal thing.

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's just that the toy industry does not line up well with the way things

414
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
are done in the game industry.

415
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Unfortunately...

416
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hundreds of SKUs. Hundreds.

417
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well, it's not that. Everything's assorted.

418
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So unfortunately, our system, the way it's set up,

419
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
there's no way to set up, hey, you're going to get random stuff in this box.

420
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So you have to sell it by the case quantities that come in.

421
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Thankfully the case is 6 or 12 for the characters,

422
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but it's a receiving nightmare because the way they do it is

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that case has a UPC on it.

424
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That UPC you have to use for each individual character they order.

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So if I order 12 of this UPC, we get in one box with that UPC.

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So it looks like we're getting one twelfth of what we order.

427
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I have to admit, if this game is, you know, as decent as Skylanders,

428
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I kind of might be on board.

429
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The Disney horror in me is kind of like, yes, please.

430
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Although I'd rather have a new Kingdom Hearts, but okay.

431
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, that's very nice.

432
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You know they had Kingdom Hearts pins at the park.

433
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I heard about this.

434
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I got you one.

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Suddenly Kingdom Hearts is being recognized by Disney again.

436
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's very exciting.

437
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And actually they thought that it was like a Jedi one,

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
but when you pull up on the receipt, it says Kingdom Hearts Mickey.

439
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yay!

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
There's two other pins that I saw online, but they weren't in the park.

441
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That would be awesome if they did like a LucasArts,

442
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Kingdom Hearts type crossover,

443
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
like have one of the worlds be Star Wars World or something like that.

444
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, don't get your hopes up.

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Muppets World.

446
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Don't go crazy now.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Muppets World would happen before Star Wars, because Muppets is Disney now.

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I understand that, yeah.

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah.

450
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Anyhow, let's get into our gaming weeks

451
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

452
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you for the update though, Loki.

453
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm sure we're going to hear a lot more about it,

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and there will probably be a big splash before E3,

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
because it's coming out.

456
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Right now it's scheduled sometime in June,

457
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
because that's when I think these movies are coming out.

458
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If I were to guess, I think there's going to be a redo of Cars,

459
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
kind of like how they did with Little Nemo 3D.

460
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I think it's going to be Cars 3D.

461
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I believe Pixar's next movie is the Monsters Inc prequel,

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
and I think it's out next year.

463
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The website for that is Epic.

464
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Is it?

465
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That was the other thing.

466
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I think they may have had some Monsters Inc characters too.

467
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That would make sense.

468
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I think that's next year.

469
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's called Monsters U.

470
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay, Monsters U. Yeah, it's like a prequel.

471
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The website that they have is done just like some college campus site.

472
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's actually really well done.

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's cool.

474
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah.

475
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay, that makes sense.

476
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
All right, well, let's get into our gaming weeks

477
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week,

478
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
or Dark Soccer if you want to, for the past three weeks,

479
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
since it's been a little while since you've been here.

480
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Stranger?

481
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I played some Escaluda,

482
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
which I'm actually now in my head thinking of it as ESP Eagle.

483
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Espagaluluda?

484
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Because Garuda would be Eagle,

485
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and I'm thinking it's Psychic Eagle.

486
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So, Espagaluda.

487
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I played, of course, WoW, fucking pandas.

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is that what the expansion is called, fucking pandas?

489
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Fucking pandas.

490
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And I finally did heroics, by the way, which are pretty fun.

491
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I did this new Show Lomance, by the way.

492
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's actually really well done.

493
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I liked it.

494
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So, played Mass Effect 3.

495
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Well, I would play more Mass Effect 3

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
if it wasn't that the stupid EA servers won't connect,

497
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and I've done every single...

498
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to try Alan's suggestion and try to connect to my Mass Effect 2,

499
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
but I never had this problem until the patch.

500
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So, it's clearly something having to do with the patch,

501
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
in my estimate.

502
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I've bought DLC that I can't use

503
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
because I can't get into single player

504
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
because it won't let me play for my saved game.

505
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Low origin.

506
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Low origin.

507
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
More like fuck origin, you know?

508
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And, uh...

509
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, not much of anything else.

510
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's like, I'll sit and play something,

511
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
but I really have tried not to be at my house too much this past week, so...

512
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Understandable.

513
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Any playthroughs of stuff that you've watched, Dan?

514
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Because you and Dan like to watch these playthroughs.

515
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
He's obsessed with Borderlands 2.

516
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
He's beaten it again.

517
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It wasn't much harder this time, and...

518
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Speaking of playthroughs,

519
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I should give this a shout out.

520
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This is an important shout out,

521
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
but shout out to everybody who participated with Extra Life this weekend.

522
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Because, I mean, there were tons of playthroughs

523
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
all over the internet for a great cause this weekend.

524
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So, I think most of those marathon fests so far,

525
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
they're probably winding down around now,

526
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
but props to all you guys who participated with that.

527
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
That's a great cause.

528
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I really want us to do something like that at some point.

529
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Even our buddy, Breslull, raised, what, 3 grand?

530
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
$3,300?

531
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah.

532
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's not a bad chunk of change.

533
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Good for you, buddy.

534
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah.

535
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Excellent.

536
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
All right, well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

537
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I wish I had played more, but I didn't.

538
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I played, let's see, lots of Minecraft.

539
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I worked on a giant roller coaster the entire week,

540
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and I pretty much finished it,

541
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
although Hitstone was working on some stuff,

542
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
so I don't know if they go check to see if it's still working again.

543
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And then also a giant marquee with chasing lights.

544
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I had those on there.

545
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's see, also play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

546
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I managed to pull off streak week.

547
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
That means I did not lose one single lunch game

548
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that I played against my coworkers in Call of Duty

549
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
to their dismay, unfortunately.

550
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So now I'm rubbing it in.

551
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I was going to go for streak month.

552
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
However, I can't play on Monday

553
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
because I have to go look for costume stuff for Halloween.

554
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What are you doing for Halloween?

555
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Well, we'll see if we're going to be too lazy about it or not,

556
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
but we're going to do costumes for the yip-yips from Sesame Street.

557
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because it's fucking easy.

558
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Yip, yip, yip, yip. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

559
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yip, yip, yip. Oh, my God, that's amazing.

560
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You're not going as Sexy Burt.

561
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Sexy Burt?

562
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, you haven't seen these costumes,

563
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Sexy Burt and Sexy Ernie?

564
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
No.

565
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
There's some company online that does all these, like, sexy costumes.

566
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
They had Sexy Burt and Sexy Ernie.

567
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Wow.

568
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
He's going to try and talk Alan into it,

569
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
but we don't have any Halloween plans.

570
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
We're at that age...

571
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
If they were going to really be sexy, they need to have assless chaps.

572
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We're at that age where we turn off the lights at ten-thirty and go to bed.

573
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Um, we'll see. I mean, once again, I don't know if I'm actually going to do it,

574
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
because the costume wouldn't be that hard.

575
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's basically just a piece of fabric, and you cut the mouth,

576
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
and you have to sew in this, like, sheer black stuff.

577
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I don't remember what it was, but I used it in my Little Big Planet Zach Boy costume.

578
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So I had to ask my mom what the fuck that was that we used.

579
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Um, but then, so it's that, and then some, like, styrofoam balls for the eyes and pipe cleaners.

580
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I mean, so it's really easy. It's just kind of doing the impression, I guess, would be...

581
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Just saying, if you ever get hard up for ideas, the chatters would love to see the tingle thing happen.

582
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, it's not going to happen, just because, once again, I mean, this is...

583
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Listen, here's what we've got, okay?

584
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Here's the three costume backup plan ideas that we have.

585
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Not necessarily something that...

586
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Obviously, it's not going to be something that we do this year.

587
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
There's Italian Spider-Man, because that's going to be hilarious.

588
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
How is Italian Spider-Man different from Spider-Man?

589
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Have you not seen Italian Spider-Man?

590
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
No, is it, like, a YouTube thing or something?

591
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, you need to see Italian Spider-Man.

592
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Okay, I haven't seen it.

593
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes, Italian Spider-Man is fucking awesome.

594
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Okay.

595
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So there's that.

596
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Actually, Danger 5 would be kind of...

597
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Same people did Italian Spider-Man, Danger 5 stuff would be hilarious.

598
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And giant cardboard robot.

599
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Unfortunately, that one requires me to learn how to walk on stilts, and it's a little dangerous to do that.

600
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You're not one to say no to a challenge.

601
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I don't really want to buy painter's stilts, you know, so...

602
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Probably not going to do that one.

603
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
But, I don't know. I think it would be funny to do the Yippie Yips if we can pull it off.

604
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So, we may do that. We'll see.

605
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Because I'm kind of... I'm not entirely broke right now, but, you know, it's like I could be doing other things right now.

606
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So we'll see.

607
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I love the chat room is trying. They're trying.

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Black Wolf in our chat room says, let's say, just as a hypothetical, if I paid for Loki's airfare, accommodations, and Dragon Con badge, would he cosplay as Tingle at Dragon Con?

609
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
No.

610
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
But I would if you paid for all of that.

611
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I know, I'm like, I would.

612
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You failed to understand, though, that I can't travel, remember?

613
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

614
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So that doesn't work.

615
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
There's now one of the difference about having the baby and having the kitty is that, you know, somebody can come watch the kitty and you can leave them on their own for so long.

616
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, you can do that with a kid later on, but not right now.

617
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
That's true, that's true.

618
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So, yeah, so there's that.

619
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And then other stuff I played, I played a little bit more of Retro City Rampage.

620
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I only like 30 minutes of it because I've been really just busy with Minecraft.

621
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
But I played a little bit of Retro City Rampage and that was fun.

622
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I got to do a mission where my future self comes back in and a souped up DeLorean and we had to charge the DeLorean's engine or whatever by running over people.

623
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So that was kind of fun.

624
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And then also I did play a little bit of the Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale.

625
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I just played one ranked match and did the tutorial.

626
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's alright.

627
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The game for me is similar to Smash Brothers, but the problem with that game, I've been playing with four people that I don't know, it's just very chaotic.

628
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I mean, I don't really know any of the characters' moves or anything.

629
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
The tutorial doesn't really, you know, it just basically tells you, okay, this button's a hit, this button's to throw people, go.

630
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
And you kind of have to figure it all out.

631
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
How long is that thing going for? Because I've yet to jump on board.

632
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Ten more days.

633
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Okay, so I've still got some time.

634
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, so you've got time for that.

635
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Maybe during break I'll go set the PS3 up to download that.

636
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It's not on PS3. Well, yeah, PlayStation Plus, I guess. Yeah, you can do that.

637
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, I have PS Plus.

638
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
So, and of course it's cross-play, so you can play against people that have the PS3 version and stuff.

639
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What else did I do?

640
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That was pretty much it.

641
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I worked a little bit more on the whole DDR stuff.

642
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I keep thinking about it.

643
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I wanted what's going to cost so much to, you know, machine the stuff I need to.

644
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So I'm almost like, maybe I should build a CIT and C machine.

645
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
So I may do that too. We'll see.

646
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
All right, my gaming week. I'll try to be quick because I know we're running long tonight.

647
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But there's some new things I want to talk about.

648
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
First, let me get the old out of the way.

649
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I've been playing more World of Warcraft, Mr. Pandaria, and while I overall do...

650
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Fucking pandas.

651
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And while overall I do love fucking pandas...

652
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Oh, that sounded really bad, didn't it?

653
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Let's rewind a little bit. Maybe I didn't really say that.

654
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We dedicate this episode to Shermie, the episode of beastiality.

655
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No, no, because that would insinuate necro beastiality.

656
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Anyway, good lord, my gaming week.

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yes, I played Mr. Pandaria or whatever you want to call it.

658
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And here's the thing, as much as I love the expansion, dailies are going to drive me fucking insane.

659
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You're a bitch.

660
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm done with dailies.

661
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And if you want to get the best gear in the game, you've got to do the dailies.

662
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And I'm so over it. That's all I want to say.

663
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Mass Effect 3.

664
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Despite Dark Soccer's issues, I'm actually able to play.

665
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Even though it will take me like five minutes to connect, finally it will connect.

666
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And on PC. I need to play more on Xbox 360. I really do.

667
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I can't believe the days are here where it's easier to do it on Xbox Live than it is the PC.

668
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But believe it.

669
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I've been really enjoying this expansion content.

670
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Even though the collectors are such assholes, every time they show up as the enemy, you're like,

671
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh god, why? Oh god, Praetorians are such dicks.

672
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh god, he's possessed.

673
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But otherwise, Mass Effect 3 is great.

674
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So let's talk about new stuff.

675
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
One game that I know y'all probably saw the review on vognetwork.com of,

676
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
and if you haven't seen it yet, you should go check out Vognetwork.

677
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because not only am I reviewing games, but we've got reviews up of TV shows and comic books and audio dramas.

678
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Everything geek you can think of. It's there at vognetwork.com.

679
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
And there's plenty more coming throughout next week and so forth.

680
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So make it a habit to check every day, okay?

681
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But anyway, on vognetwork.com, I reviewed Dance Central 3, which Harmonix was kind enough to send us a copy of.

682
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
And I did enjoy it.

683
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know, I like Dance Central 1. I like Dance Central 2.

684
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I think by the time you get to a third game, you start to kind of feel like,

685
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
alright, what are they going to be able to pull off that's actually new that they didn't do in the past two games?

686
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Believe it or not, Dance Central 3 did find some new things to do.

687
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
One of them is a very, very smart party mode.

688
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And, you know, when you boot the game, do you want to go to the main menu or do you want to just start the party?

689
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And when I'm talking party mode, I'm talking pretty good mix of multiplayer things.

690
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You know, the two people dancing at the same time that you're used to.

691
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
This whole dance battle tournament style thing where, you know, the crew battle,

692
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
where you can set it up with like eight people, I think, can all do this.

693
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Or just jump in, jump out, high five, play.

694
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's really smart the way they did it.

695
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And I think it's going to get even better.

696
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's unfortunate I couldn't see the game's full, full potential right now because Smart Glass,

697
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
it's supposed to be one of the first games that's going to support the Smart Glass,

698
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
where while people are dancing on the couch, maybe you're not the type that wants to get up and dance.

699
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Well, you can sit there on the couch and control what songs are coming up next through Smart Glass.

700
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So I think that's a pretty neat use of it.

701
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You know, it's using the technology wisely without whoring it, and I think that's a smart way to do it.

702
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So, yeah, there's a lot of good stuff in Dance Central 3, especially when it comes to multiplayer.

703
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, the mimic. You can do a dance move and then your partner has to like mimic it too.

704
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
That's kind of neat.

705
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Solo stuff. When it comes to the solo stuff, it's kind of what you know already.

706
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I mean, there's only so much one person can do.

707
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
However, there is a comprehensive new story mode in the game.

708
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I thought it was a little silly.

709
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Some people will enjoy its over-the-topness.

710
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I was a little bit like, all right, why am I playing this mode again?

711
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Because I'd rather would just like choose the songs I want to do and dance to it.

712
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And to give the game credit, I can do that.

713
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I can just go into the dance mode to do it.

714
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But I did kind of sit there going, oh, this mode is actually put together really nicely.

715
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It's kind of a shame it's so silly.

716
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But, you know, I liked the concept that you were traveling through the decades

717
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
because it really gave it a comprehensive song list.

718
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But to give you an idea how silly it was, you find yourself in Dance Central Intelligence, DCI,

719
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
and they send you back in time to find the dance moves of the evil guy.

720
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's silly.

721
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But it was a good excuse to put things like YMCA, you know, and some of the 70s classics are there.

722
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I actually thought the 70s-

723
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Do we get the hustle?

724
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Yes, the hustle is in the game.

725
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh my God, I have to play it.

726
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Do you know what song is in the game?

727
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You Will Lose Your Shit to represent the 80s.

728
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What?

729
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Let the music play.

730
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's like my favorite 80s song ever.

731
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I know.

732
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
When I saw that in there, I was like, oh, Dark Soccer is going to flip her shit.

733
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But then there's like, okay-

734
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Consider my shit flipped.

735
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Then some of the 90s stuff, I was like, all right, we need to stop.

736
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
We need to stop.

737
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Ice Ice Baby.

738
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know, he's 45 now.

739
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Vanilla Ice is 45.

740
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Hangin' Tough, or one of the new Kids on the Block songs is in there.

741
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This is silly, silly shit.

742
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Really?

743
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Okay, so as much as you can look at that and laugh and whatever, when you get into the modern stuff,

744
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I was not a big, big fan of the modern stuff they picked.

745
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Here's the problem.

746
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2 had such good song lists when it came to contemporary stuff,

747
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
there was really slim pickings for 3.

748
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I mean, some of the newer- like, they have moves like Jagger and the J-Lo song,

749
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and you know, some of them are represented,

750
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but it didn't feel as modern club as Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2.

751
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But the good news, of course, if you own the prior games, you import the song list for 400 Microsoft points.

752
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
You don't have to pay it again for number 1 if you already imported 1 into 2,

753
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
which is great.

754
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So, um, yeah.

755
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I, you know, overall, I ended up giving the game a B-plus on VOG Network.

756
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The strengths, of course, were the party mode, the instant stuff.

757
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The fact that I felt like there were more things to do in Part 3 from Part 2

758
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
than there were from Part 1 to Part 2.

759
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Mm-hmm.

760
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
What?

761
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Was there gay dancing mode?

762
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Funny you should bring that up.

763
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You know, if you play Dance Central 2, a lot of the dances are very, shall we say, feminine.

764
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Dance Central 3, I wasn't feeling that.

765
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And maybe a big part of that has to do with the song list.

766
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Although there was one song. What was it?

767
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh, um, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

768
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba.

769
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Hello.

770
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Hello.

771
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Uh uh uh oh.

772
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
You know that song?

773
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Like, you have to do, like, these little, like, moves called, like, seduce and things

774
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
where you're basically, like, smacking your ass and all this stuff.

775
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
That was, that was still a little, a little bit gay dancing.

776
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
But, you know, I liked it a little bit.

777
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And plus, nothing is more hilarious, I'm sorry, I don't care who you are,

778
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
we're gonna have some real talk right now about Dance Central.

779
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Nothing is more hilarious than when you get to that freestyle section of the song

780
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
where it takes 16 pictures of you or whatever really fast

781
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
to run up to the camera and start booty poppin'

782
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and then turn around just in time to see your butt back on the screen.

783
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Come on.

784
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You know you've all tried it.

785
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
No, I have not tried it.

786
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You need to try it. It's fun.

787
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I still think, though, that nothing is as wonderful as watching you play, um, the ABBA.

788
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh, the, the, uh, yeah, that's, that's the sad thing,

789
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is that the 70s, unfortunately, did not have ABBA to represent them.

790
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But I always thought Sony had the lock on ABBA because of SingStar,

791
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
but then Ubisoft had that You Can Dance game, so I don't know, I guess.

792
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm not gonna hold my breath.

793
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I'm not gonna hold my breath for Dance Central to get the rights to it.

794
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's, it's alright. It's alright.

795
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So, uh, there you go.

796
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
AcidicVampire in chat says, yes, but can I bend and snap?

797
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You can do whatever you want in freestyle mode.

798
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I've never tried that.

799
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I've also never fucked pandas like Rob has.

800
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Hey, hey, shut up.

801
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Alright, what else new can I talk about?

802
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Oh, um, I went into GameStop this week.

803
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I know, I know.

804
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I just, I was there and I had this impulse.

805
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Like, I, I, I had to have LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation Vita right now.

806
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Like, I wasn't gonna wait for Amazon. I had to go get it right now.

807
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I understand that, so why didn't you just buy it digitally?

808
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You know what?

809
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Because, because I want, I don't, I don't like it.

810
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That worked out for me getting Mass Effect 3 because I was impatient

811
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
and I actually got him to go down to the Amazon price.

812
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
But anyway, I, I ended up buying it.

813
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But not only did I, um, go into GameStop to buy that game,

814
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
but they had a Wii U demo unit up and running.

815
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So, uh, check that, I think these things are starting to show up

816
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
at your Best Buys and GameStops and where have you.

817
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Uh, so if you want to get your hands on the Wii U, you can do that.

818
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Uh, I was surprised, I'll say this much.

819
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't want to get into the whole Wii U debate thing again

820
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
because we're already running long, but I will say this much.

821
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I was surprised those tablets were a lot bigger than I was giving it credit for.

822
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because in my mind, I'm thinking, oh, that thing is kind of like

823
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the bottom part of a, a 3DS or whatever.

824
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So I was thinking it was gonna be, like, I didn't think it would be that small,

825
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
but I didn't think it would be that big either.

826
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the Wii U pad.

827
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Otherwise, there wasn't a lot on the demo unit to really get a feel for the system.

828
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
The only thing you could play was the Rayman's, uh, game.

829
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I watched Alan play it, I didn't really want to play it.

830
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
He played some mode that really reminded me of Bit.Trip Runner,

831
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
which I don't remember that being in Rayman, but alright,

832
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I guess it's one of the mini-games or whatever,

833
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
is there's like a mode like Bit.Trip Runner where you're kind of hitting buttons in tune to the music.

834
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So, there you go.

835
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So, hmm, um, what was I gonna say, uh, so was the controller comfortable? I mean...

836
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Yeah, I thought it was, it was fine. I didn't, I didn't really hold it for very long

837
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
because Alan did the playing of the demo, but I thought, I thought it was fine.

838
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It's, it's, it's like bigger than a PlayStation Vita.

839
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I mean, it's, you do have to kind of get used to it.

840
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
It's like holding this small little laptop in your hands.

841
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's almost, it's almost bigger than this.

842
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
This, uh, it's slightly bigger than this.

843
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And I'm pointing at this, um, laptop thing.

844
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The Dell Mini 10.

845
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Dark Soccer's using what?

846
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
The Dell Mini 10.

847
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah.

848
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So, anyway.

849
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I apparently just got an answer from EA about my stupid Mass Effect thing, so I'm going to check it.

850
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Oh, are you gonna try playing Mass Effect right now during the show?

851
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
No, I can't play on the netbook.

852
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I was gonna say.

853
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That'll make that thing implode if you try to do that.

854
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Alright.

855
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It won't make it implode. It'll just melt into a puddle of for fuck's sake.

856
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Uh, Nate4322 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, would you buy it?

857
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I'm thinking about getting one.

858
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Um, I'm probably gonna get one because I'm a consumer whore.

859
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I didn't pre-order one, though.

860
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And hell.

861
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I didn't, so unless I can get the hookup, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, uh, through friends, I'm, I may not, I may be shit out of luck.

862
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You can do what I did.

863
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
What?

864
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Wait in line outside Target.

865
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
All night.

866
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I don't, oh yeah, Target didn't do pre-orders, did they?

867
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
We bribed, we bribed our way into the line.

868
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah.

869
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Um, I was gonna say that, uh, well, Rayman Legends is your type of game.

870
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You're not getting it at launch.

871
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It's coming out in March now.

872
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Alright.

873
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Um, hey, that's launch window.

874
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Cause, you know, launch window is like this, you know, if Nintendo has windows that large, I mean, shit, I'm surprised they haven't gotten broken into.

875
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Alright, you.

876
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
We're not debating the Wii U tonight.

877
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Um, I will talk about, though, LittleBigPlanet Vita briefly.

878
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I haven't been able to spend a whole lot of time with it, but I will say I'm pleasantly surprised with it so far.

879
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It really does feel like I'm playing LittleBigPlanet 2 on the go.

880
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
The game looks really nice.

881
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And the new touch mechanic, pretty cool, where, um, basically the new big thing you can do is that certain blocks will be a very bright color.

882
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
It's very prominent.

883
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
You can't miss it.

884
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And you can actually pick those blocks up with your finger and move them around.

885
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And you can use them to, uh, you know, move Sackboy and so forth.

886
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
But they also, you know, you can use it like little plungers to make Sackboy like a pinball.

887
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You know, you can kind of do different things with it.

888
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And I thought this was really cool, some of the mini games.

889
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Like, you'll launch a mini game and the little icon comes up that says, turn your PS Vita sideways.

890
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So you turn the PlayStation Vita sideways and the whole level is played vertically.

891
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Like, the first one you get is like a whack-a-mole thing that you use with your finger.

892
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So, you know, LittleBigPlanet in so far, it's, uh, it's impressing me.

893
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Um, I haven't had enough, again, to give my full impressions.

894
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But the one other thing I'll say about it that I actually liked compared to LittleBigPlanet 2 is that it did not default to,

895
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
let's go online and play with strangers, yay!

896
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Like, no, it defaults to play by yourself.

897
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And if you want to do that, you can.

898
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But you don't, like, it's not being shoved down your throat to do that.

899
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So I'm, I'm, uh, I was very happy about that.

900
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And that already has me liking it almost a little more than LittleBigPlanet 2.

901
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Although I do love LittleBigPlanet 2.

902
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Alright, we're going to get into gaming news already, but first, some quick housekeeping.

903
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and, uh, of course, Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to be our friend on various social networks.

904
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Um, I think that's really it.

905
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There's no, the award nomination stuff is all over now.

906
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
We're just waiting to hear if enough of you nominated.

907
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And we'll find out, I think Stitcher's stuff goes up tomorrow, so we'll see.

908
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We'll let you know on the next show.

909
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But meanwhile, we're going to deliver some gaming news and talk about it a little bit.

910
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
So, Loki, as always, start us off.

911
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So, let's talk about another company laying off people.

912
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
It's, uh, Sony this time around.

913
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
They're cutting 2,000 jobs out of their head office.

914
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And, um, they're expecting about 20% of the employees leaving by the end of the year.

915
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The way they're doing this is they're giving them early retirements, I guess.

916
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And, um, also I guess they, uh, had already laid off 10,000 people earlier this year.

917
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And, uh, I guess just trying to, you know, make up some of the lost money that they've had.

918
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Because, uh, they're trying to, I guess, save $378 million annually.

919
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I mean, that's kind of the trend nowadays.

920
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Like, got to do more with less, I guess.

921
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And, you know, sometimes maybe they just have too much overlap with some of those positions.

922
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You know, funny enough, somebody asked me earlier.

923
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
We were playing that clip about, uh, the tester and all that earlier in the show.

924
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Somebody asked me, do you know if there's going to be a tester for the answer?

925
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yes, I actually can answer that for you.

926
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The answer is no, there's not going to be a tester for.

927
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And the reason why, it actually has nothing to do with the quality of the show or whatever,

928
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
or whatever easy joke you want to make.

929
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Remember when all those layoffs happened at Santa Monica Studio that majorly hit the PR department in that area?

930
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
The people who did the tester were let go.

931
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's surrounding out there on the internet.

932
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Wasn't that also core as well, then they get rid of core?

933
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I believe so.

934
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So, there will not be a tester for unless they decide to rehire for it at a later time.

935
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And go fig, that core wasn't a very good, um, way to get people to sign up for PlayStation Plus.

936
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Unfortunate.

937
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah, well, what you gonna do?

938
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Um, so yeah, that kind of sucks.

939
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Also, they're saying that they are going to be letting go 840 employees as part of their lens factory in Minokamo.

940
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Because, you know, they do make blu-ray players and CD players and DVD players, so.

941
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And cameras.

942
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Lots of lenses.

943
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Well, do you think this has to, is this the usual ebb and flow of what we see happening at game companies where projects end and people get let go?

944
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Or do you want to go so far as to make the argument that the PlayStation 3's performance or lack thereof is to blame for this?

945
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I think it's neither of that. I think all it is is just that they're maybe suffering losses in other areas.

946
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Like perhaps, you know, TV's aren't maybe doing as well. You know, the Sony phones maybe not selling as well.

947
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Or they just need to cut costs because they're not making as much as they were before.

948
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And so now they're going to just lay people off. I mean, that kind of happens in all industries where they'll just kind of try to streamline things a little bit more.

949
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Maybe they just don't have work for these people. Or, you know, they decided, hey, we don't need a reality show that kind of is alright, I guess.

950
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:03,000
And it's costing us a lot of money to put this out. And really, we're not seeing much of a return on, you know, people signing up for PlayStation Plus.

951
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Although I don't think that was exclusive to PlayStation Plus. But we don't have people coming to our network because of the tester.

952
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So let's just cut some costs there and we'll just give people free games instead for PlayStation Plus.

953
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, do you think the people who won on the tester also got laid off? Can Sony lay off game testers? Well, yes, they can.

954
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And actually, go back and listen to the show that had Asuka was on the show, you know, when that was new.

955
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It ended up being the week before she was kicked off. But she said that they would get everybody hyped up about the prize and then the cameras would cut.

956
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Just so you guys know, it's a six month contract. So technically, Sony was never under any obligation to hire those people.

957
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Didn't we talk about it like a couple weeks ago? There was the guy that, I think it was the first guy that won. He came out like smashing, like totally dissing Sony on a bunch of stuff.

958
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Like talking about how they've made mistakes, you know, left and right with their properties. Did they? I don't know. I don't think we talked about that here.

959
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yeah, I remember reading that. Well, I can say the second guy who won, the gamer, he used his position to end up moving up to Sony Pictures.

960
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:19,000
He works for Sony Entertainment now, so he wouldn't have been affected by this. The first guy, he got into PR, so he might've, I mean, I don't know, I can't speak for the guy.

961
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And the other thing to consider too is all these layoffs are in Japan. There's nothing in the US. But we did have the PR layoffs that happened just not that long ago.

962
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I don't know what would have happened with the third guy that won because he was a very recent winner, but most of these guys, and he was an associate producer, right?

963
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, he was probably under contract somewhere or something.

964
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And as ShadowNextGen in chat says, any company can lay off anyone. That's absolutely right. So who knows? Who knows?

965
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Been there, done that.

966
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yep. All right, let's move on with more news. Good luck to those that were impacted by this. This is never any fun to report on.

967
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But hey, I'll use this as an opportunity to plug Bobby's show from tonight. He had a great interview tonight with a game recruiter who was very motivational about how to, you know, kind of be resilient about what happens when you get laid off and kind of what not to do.

968
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And I found that very interesting because he was very honest. So I'm not going to give it all away though. You have to go check that out, BobbyBlackWolf.

969
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Show which will be posted to vognetwork.com at some point this week or look him up on Stitcher as well, BobbyBlackWolf.

970
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Let's talk about Zynga real quick. So Zynga is having a very interesting year. They're stock, they're games, and now people seem to be abandoning ship left and right.

971
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And one of these people that's left is getting sued. And it's the former Cityville general manager. I didn't even realize there was a game called Cityville, but I guess that makes sense.

972
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:07,000
The guy's name is Alan Patmore. And in this lawsuit, Zynga believes that Alan Patmore uploaded company assets to a Dropbox account from his company computer, both on the day before and day of his departure from the company.

973
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Well that's a no-no. That would be information on Zynga's game mechanics, Cityville's performance assessments, monetization plans, emails, design documents, including an unreleased game design document.

974
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So Mr. Patmore went to a social game company called KixEye and Zynga is alleging, again we can't say he did it, we don't know, but Zynga is alleging in these documents that he is going to use this information to directly compete with Zynga.

975
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:49,000
A quote from the lawsuit could be used to improve a competitor's internal understanding and know-how of core game mechanics and monetization techniques, its execution, and ultimately its market standing to compete more effectively with Zynga.

976
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Patmore apparently refused to sign a termination certification. They're saying this reaffirmed all of this information.

977
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
They're trying to block Patmore and his company from accessing the data and they want it back.

978
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:16,000
KixEye, in an interview with All Things Digital, said they have nothing to do with the suit, but apparently they slipped this thing in at Zynga.

979
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Unfortunately, this appears to be Zynga's new employee retention strategy, suing former employees to scare current employees into staying.

980
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Thoughts? I mean, we don't know if the guy really did it or not.

981
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I mean, if it's true, big if, capital I, capital F, if it's true, that's obviously a huge no-no.

982
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
You don't upload shit to your personal account. I mean, that's just setting yourself up for disaster, no matter what it is.

983
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
It's one thing to take, you know, company typefaces that were designed for the company. Another thing to take game mechanics.

984
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Yeah, it's kind of different. It's kind of, well, it's still not appropriate.

985
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I can't help it if they had pretty font, okay?

986
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But still, I mean, let's say that if you did design work at the company, what's appropriate for you to take with you and master files?

987
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Technically, you did it on the company clock, so they belong to the company.

988
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That's true. But there is, you can keep your own work for the sake of your portfolio.

989
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I was just about to say, now, surely you can have like a PDF for your portfolio or whatever, but you don't get to keep.

990
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
If it's stuff this guy designed, then he's entitled to retain a copy for himself. He just can't use it elsewhere.

991
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah, but if we're talking about information on Zynga's game mechanics, assessments of the performance, that's not one person.

992
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So what you're saying is he had a copy of Tiny Towers on his computer that he uploaded to the Dropbox, right?

993
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So, yeah, I don't know. Zynga, we're going to get into this a little later when we get to the Google question of the week,

994
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
but I'm very interested to see where Zynga ends up in a few years because it really seems like that company is, it's abandoned ship fast over there.

995
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I don't know. So I kind of point and laugh at them every time I'm in San Francisco.

996
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I have a cry because I always go, that was the Sega building that used to be like Dreamcast headquarters.

997
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
And now it's Farmville 2 headquarters. I know, seriously. Fuck a whole lot of Farmville 2.

998
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
I keep getting invites for that on Facebook. I have tried to block it and I'm still getting it.

999
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
While I'm at it, fuck Facebook. Do you know I couldn't use the Facebook?

1000
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
You know how like Facebook has a separate camera application? It would not let me use it.

1001
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It says location services are required to use this application.

1002
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I said fuck you and deleted it. I'll just use Instagram where it's optional.

1003
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And like every time, I'm going to get on a separate here, but I turn location stuff off on Facebook and I've talked about this before.

1004
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
If I want to advertise where I am, I'll use Foursquare.

1005
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Otherwise, I don't see the need to always post every place I'm at, including my home address.

1006
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So turn it off. But it just keeps magically coming back on on Facebook.

1007
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm about ready to go back to Google+.

1008
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I'm about ready to just delete Facebook, but I've threatened that about four times on this show and I haven't done it yet.

1009
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
So I need to put my money where my mouth is, I guess.

1010
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
On top of that, Facebook has turned into Attention Horse Central.

1011
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Pay attention to me. Pay attention to me.

1012
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Well, Facebook does exist on the Internet, so we'll see.

1013
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Let's pay attention to your story, Dark Soccer. What do you have for us?

1014
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
This is awesome because it's Sega. Sega.

1015
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm sure you've all heard of the Model 2 arcade board, right? There's some great games on it.

1016
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Virtua Fighter. Well, I won't say Virtua Fighter was great because I'm a Virtua Fighter.

1017
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I thought you said great games.

1018
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah. Well, there's a lot of people who are fans of Virtua Fighter 2.

1019
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I only played that game to try to knock Kage's mask off.

1020
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Sonic Fighters. Sonic the Fighters was great.

1021
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And one of my favorite ever games, Virtual On.

1022
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, there's going to be an Xbox Live arcade and a PlayStation Network, which is a release game that's a Model 2 collection.

1023
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers, Cyber Trooper Virtual On, Virtua Striker, and Sonic the Fighters.

1024
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I'll tell you what my experience with Sonic the Fighters is, is Fighters Megamix.

1025
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
You could also play as the car from Daytona and beat people up with a car.

1026
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1027
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Which I believe is another Model 2 game, right?

1028
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Yes. No, it was Home Only.

1029
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That already came out anyway.

1030
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Daytona was Model 2.

1031
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I was thinking of Fighters Megamix.

1032
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I understand. Yes, it's already come out.

1033
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I understand. It's still another excuse to play the song.

1034
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Anyway, it's going to be, for Japan pricing anyways, 800 Microsoft points, or 10 bucks.

1035
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I'm sure we're going to get it, so yay.

1036
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
We need a Fighters Megamix 2.

1037
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Fighters Megamix was so much fun.

1038
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's just the fun thing about playing as a car.

1039
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm a car. Punch. Sonic versus car.

1040
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That was great.

1041
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Good times.

1042
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Okay.

1043
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I was just thinking. I saw a Robot Chicken clip this week of Street Fighter.

1044
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It was basically Ryu telling people what to do as far as scheduling all their fights and stuff.

1045
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
One of the fights was Ken.

1046
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I thought I was supposed to be fighting E. Honda.

1047
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No, I'm sorry. That says you're fighting A. Honda.

1048
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
This is stupid. Why would I want to fight a car?

1049
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Just punch the car. Okay. He starts punching the car.

1050
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Hey, this is actually kind of cool.

1051
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So it was like the bonus round?

1052
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Yeah, it was the bonus round.

1053
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
That's pretty cool.

1054
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That was great.

1055
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Anyways, let's talk a little bit about some cool stuff.

1056
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:58,000
We always talk about holodeck gaming as kind of the, you know, oh my god.

1057
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Everything we've ever done in gaming has been taking us one step closer to the holodeck.

1058
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Remember when we were kids and we all saw Mode 7 for the first time, like pilot wings and stuff?

1059
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And it's like, oh my god. This blows my fucking mind.

1060
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Dracula X on Super Nintendo.

1061
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The fire's moving.

1062
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Oh my god. It's like real parallax scrolling.

1063
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Everything since then has been taking us one step closer to the holodeck.

1064
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yeah, and we're not the only ones to think that.

1065
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Of course, also Gearbox Software President Randy Pitchford kind of saying the same thing.

1066
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Imagine the spectrum of what's possible in the computing world.

1067
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And, you know, basically look at how fast everything is progressing.

1068
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You know, how the engines are getting bigger and bigger.

1069
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It says the real exciting thing is about the people, the relationships and the business involved and how they're working together.

1070
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You know, obviously there's going to be, you know, better simulations, better.

1071
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I mean, if you think about it, look at how far things have gone in just the last like 20 years, 30 years.

1072
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I mean, it's just been like, holy crap.

1073
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Well, yeah, I mean, Super Nintendo was 1990 when that came out.

1074
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So like 92 would have been right at the height of like Super Nintendo.

1075
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah, I mean, we're 20 years since then.

1076
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
20 years. Can you imagine what 20 years from now is going to be? It's like, fuck yeah.

1077
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Or what is the Ultra HD?

1078
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
We're just going to have a chip in our brain. So we close our eyes and we're playing Mass Effect.

1079
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Well, now there's, you'll get to make out with Garris for real.

1080
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
There's Ultra HD now is that new thing, right?

1081
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Because I was reading on the internet this week, that's the now approved 4K.

1082
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
4K is now Ultra HD or whatever. So that's what we have to look forward to.

1083
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
And, you know, 3D is already a thing.

1084
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'm sure it's just a matter of time before you have an environment where you can have TVs on three walls,

1085
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
so you can like look all around you and see things in 3D. I mean, that's where we're going to be at in 20 years.

1086
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That would basically be the Microsoft thing that they have with their projectors and stuff, what we were talking about before.

1087
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
They actually are doing holographic television. I was watching a special on it just like a month ago.

1088
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
And you want to know what kind of creeps me out? Like now that I have an iPhone 5,

1089
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
you know what kind of creeps me out a little bit? Siri.

1090
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Like for real. Like, Siri kind of creeps me out a little bit because like I can tell it.

1091
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Open the pod bay doors.

1092
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Yeah, she's a little slow though.

1093
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
That's a rather insensitive thing to say to an intelligent agent.

1094
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
See, but like she does shit like that. Like the other day, or no, no, this is earlier.

1095
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Like just earlier today, I hit the little button. I said, Siri, wake me up in 30 minutes.

1096
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
And she goes, okay, I set the alarm for, you know, 440 or whatever it was.

1097
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,000
And then I just out of habit, I went, thank you. That's it. And she goes, I live to serve.

1098
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And I'm like, I just talked to my iPhone. Really? You live to serve. Are you programmed?

1099
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Have you ever told Siri good night? No, I never had. Good night to you too.

1100
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,000
See, like we're getting into like, like we're getting a little closer to this Cylon thing that has me a little bit worried.

1101
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I mean, artificial intelligence has really taken off in 20 years too. That's all I'm saying.

1102
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Like, can you imagine that type of interaction, like in a mass effect type of game? It's just, it's crazy.

1103
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?

1104
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
No one cares.

1105
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Hush.

1106
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Just because it could, doesn't mean that it would.

1107
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Why can't it just say stop fucking wasting my time with stupid inane questions?

1108
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Doesn't she get offended if you go like, fuck you or whatever. Doesn't she say, you are entitled to your opinion, or this is about you, not about me.

1109
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
That one's my favorite. What if you go, you can also though, ask her how to make meth and it'll pull up the chemical formula.

1110
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
What if you, what if you, um, you go up to her and you go, Hey, how you doing? You know, like friends.

1111
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
How you doing?

1112
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm testing it out.

1113
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Siri's thinking about it.

1114
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Beep beep.

1115
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Okay.

1116
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Let me try one here.

1117
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Where could I score some marijuana?

1118
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Schedule?

1119
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yes. I'm sorry. You can't take the train to marijuana town.

1120
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I like though. I like this one.

1121
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Where can I hide a body?

1122
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Martuaries, swamps, metal foundries, cremation services, reservoirs, mines, or dumps.

1123
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Metal foundries.

1124
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
What is this Terminator?

1125
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
All right, turn that bitch off. I'm sorry.

1126
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Where, where were we? Holodeck.

1127
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
How can I stop Skynet?

1128
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Anyways, so holiday gaming, of course it's always going to be what it's going to be.

1129
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:07,000
You know, the goal. And I think that, you know, as we get, it seems to be the whole kind of 3D's coming back, the whole VR stuff's almost coming back a little bit with that, um, you know, Oculus Rift stuff.

1130
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And, you know, of course more of the, you know, haptic technologies are kind of taking off.

1131
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I'm sure in, I'm sure in 10 years time we'll have, you know, some pretty interesting, uh, interactions with the computers. It's going to become more seamless.

1132
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
You know, it's, it's just like, you know, if you think about it now, you know, like 30 years ago, someone told you, yeah, you're going to be carrying around computers with you.

1133
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:40,000
You know, like everybody's like had that whole futuristic fantasy of like a wristwatch computer thing, but look at, look at that, you've got like a HD screen in your, the palm of your hand.

1134
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
It's basically better than what you wanted.

1135
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You know, 20 years ago you had a 40 megabyte drive in your computer and that was like Uber storage for everything. Now you can store what, like almost a thousand times that in the, in a little tiny chip in your hand. It's crazy.

1136
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So it's, it's going to be interesting.

1137
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Well, I'm glad that our game developers are already thinking about the holodeck. That's, I think that's a good sign.

1138
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Too bad it doesn't matter because the world's going to end this, no, just kidding. No one believes that, except for crazy people.

1139
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:27,000
All right. Well, one thing that the holodeck may not have in it is Facebook and Twitter. That's because Microsoft is doing away with it. In their fall 2012 update, Twitter and Facebook are going to be gone from the dashboard.

1140
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:38,000
These apps are officially being retired. In an interview with IGN, Microsoft said they are quote retiring the Facebook and Twitter apps. No comment on if they're ever going to come back.

1141
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Assumptions are, well, now you have Internet Explorer 9 that's built in. So if you really want to do Facebook and Twitter, you can go on to Internet Explorer and do it that way.

1142
01:04:49,000 --> 01:05:01,000
All right. Let's be real though. Everybody's talking about this on the internet. Everybody's mentioning this. I bet if they had just deleted them, a lot of you would have never known because seriously, when was the last time you used Twitter on your Xbox?

1143
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'll tell you when you used Twitter on your Xbox. You loaded it up the first day it came out and wrote a tweet that said, hi from my Xbox 360, lol butts goodbye. And that was probably the last time you did it.

1144
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:24,000
So instead of, you know, making Twitter and Facebook so terribly difficult to use in the Xbox 360, why couldn't they have implemented it into the dashboard?

1145
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Oh, because that would have taken too much work. Because before it was like, okay, you have the exit out of your game. You have the exit out of all this other stuff to see information on Twitter or Facebook.

1146
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:53,000
But Windows Messenger, you can get messages on that and you can see them pop up. But why can't you just have the same thing on the dashboard for the Xbox 360 where you can pop it up immediately, just hit the guide button or something like that and see that.

1147
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Because that would be too much work. We want you to use our shitty fucking internet browser, Internet Explorer.

1148
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yeah, if a console really wanted to be cutting edge, you would have one button. You should be able to press one button and get a menu and hit Facebook and your feed comes right up.

1149
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
None of this loading time, none of this going out of the app, it needs to be embedded or it's useless.

1150
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I think it's also kind of stupid that, well, I'm sure they're proud of Internet Explorer, but no one's like, fuck yeah, I get to use Internet Explorer on my Xbox. Just call it the Xbox web browser.

1151
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Because Internet Explorer doesn't mean fucking kick ass, it means fucking garbage is what it means.

1152
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Because Microsoft is not going to give up on their branding.

1153
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It's basically the thing I use to go fucking download Firefox or Google Chrome. I use it the one time when I loaded my operating system to download that fucking program if I don't already have it on jump drive.

1154
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Okay, now here's the thing. I will say this about the Facebook application. There's one thing that I did think was very useful about that Facebook application.

1155
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You could go in and you could instantly see what your friends, your people on Facebook, what their gamer tags were.

1156
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So if you were like their friend on Facebook and they connected to the Xbox, you could see their gamer tag so you could easily add people to your Xbox friends list.

1157
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
That was useful. I hope they will retain that in some capacity. That's really all I can think of.

1158
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Of course, they still have not upped the limit.

1159
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I was just about to say.

1160
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So I can't add anybody else anyway, but, you know, if somebody decides to, you know, face, if somebody decides to Xbox breakup with me, as this happened in the past, then I'll have a couple slots where I can add more people and I would like them to be people I know on Facebook and what have you.

1161
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So, let's see.

1162
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Blackwolf in our chat says, hey guys, remember we could watch videos on our 360 without loading a Zune video app? Those were good times.

1163
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Yeah, they need to make this stuff easier, not more difficult.

1164
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Their apps thing is kind of dumb. I mean.

1165
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It's what bugs me about Mass Effect 3 on Origin and why I keep giving Origin a bad time.

1166
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Origin, if you want to get it right, I should be able to load Mass Effect 3 and instantly go into a multiplayer game. Instantly. Not five minutes later.

1167
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And not have to verify my DLC.

1168
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That's the stuff that's starting to bug me. That's what's going to keep the holodeck from happening. Bullshit. Bullshit is going to stop the holodeck from happening.

1169
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Yes, we're headed towards the holodeck, but we are having to go through so much bullshit to get there.

1170
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm sorry, we can't authenticate your person because you've gotten a haircut.

1171
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Come back in two months once your hair has grown out. It's ridiculous.

1172
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Just remember how they were talking about, and I don't even know anybody that would ever do this, where you would leave your Xbox 360 on and Kinect would recognize your face and log you in.

1173
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Or I can hit the guide button and just log myself in, probably infinitely faster than that stupid thing.

1174
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I don't have to have Kinect hooked up.

1175
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:03,000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom says, at live.vognetwork.com says, where is my MySpace or GeoCities app? Didn't GeoCities finally officially close?

1176
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It's totally gone. MySpace, however, is coming back, baby.

1177
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:21,000
To be fair, I use the Twitter app in Xbox about as often as I use, well, maybe a couple more times on the Vita, but I haven't really used it on the Vita or the Facebook app.

1178
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Because I have a phone. It's cool they have this integration, and weren't they going to have it where you can send screenshots of your gameplay and stuff like that on Facebook?

1179
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Some games have that, like NBA, 2K13, or whatever.

1180
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Like, yeah, why don't we just add that to all games instead of just, you know...

1181
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Here's the other thing. Like, I'm now going to access Twitter on my phone. Okay? Ready? Tap. Tap. Wait. There's my feed. It's up, and it's already refreshed.

1182
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
That's how long it took me to get Twitter up on my phone. That's why I prefer to use my phone, because you know how long that would have taken me to do on my Vita?

1183
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You know, opening...

1184
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
And then, like, oh, downloading new update.

1185
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
And then, like, oh, going to connecting to Twitter.

1186
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Downloading tweets. Like, it doesn't work that fast. That's the problem.

1187
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Hooray for you getting Twitter. Now make it work better.

1188
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So, anyway.

1189
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Let's move on with Dark Soccer.

1190
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Actually, real quick, I was going to say it's even more ironic, the fact that they're getting rid of Facebook and Twitter, is how integrated that stuff is in Windows 8.

1191
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It kind of seems a little backwards that we're getting this Windows 8 dashboard thing on the Xbox, and yet they're not having that same type of integration.

1192
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Well, maybe they're able to do it instantly on the desktop, where they are having that problem on the Xbox for whatever reason.

1193
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

1194
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Tangled Yarn.

1195
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Are you knitting during the show?

1196
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I'm crocheting, thank you.

1197
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
My ball of cheap-ass yarn has got a tangle in it. Never buy yarn from the dollar store.

1198
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Anyway, how many people liked Elder Scrolls III and liked Oblivion?

1199
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Me.

1200
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Who liked Kingdoms of Amalur?

1201
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I didn't play it.

1202
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Far less people.

1203
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I hear it's not bad. I don't think we should give it too much shit.

1204
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Well, the lead designer for those two Elder Scrolls games, Ken Rolston, jumped ship. He's off with Turbine Now, which is the developer for Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons and Dragons Online.

1205
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Which I'm kind of playing Lotor, but kind of. It's pretty. It's got cherry blossoms, so I like it.

1206
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Basically, I'm trying to see if I can. Yeah, he basically said they're really excited to have him, and I guess that the Elder Scrolls franchise will just have to keep going with whoever the new people are.

1207
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Well, he didn't have Skyrim on his resume. That game turned out alright.

1208
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But still, I'm not this guy, obviously. It's a name I've heard before, and I know he's contributed a lot to these franchises, so I think any company is lucky to have him.

1209
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And he's wearing a beret.

1210
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Which instantly makes somebody awesome.

1211
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,000


1212
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games you can look forward to real soon, and it is getting to be that time of year, right?

1213
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
It's already been that time of year for a few weeks now.

1214
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Yeah, I mean, next month's a huge month, right?

1215
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's not so bad.

1216
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But yeah, there's a lot of games coming out. This week, of course, we had Skylanders Giants come out today, along with all those wonderful packs and stuff.

1217
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
That was on PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the 3DS and PC.

1218
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:52,000
On the Vita this week, we get Street Fighter X Tekken. On PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Medal of Honor Warfighter.

1219
01:12:52,000 --> 01:13:01,000
On PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013. Also, they have a bundle with this Fear Master gun. It senses your fear!

1220
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Your fear of playing a mediocre game, but it senses it!

1221
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That game, that should be a gun for Silent Hill or something like that.

1222
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Fear gun.

1223
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
It senses your heart.

1224
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:22,000
It senses your heart. It's basically the Nintendo... that sensor thing that never came out.

1225
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
The Vitality sensor.

1226
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Yes, it's the Vitality sensor for Cabela's... yeah.

1227
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And then they also have Cabela's Hunting expeditions on the same systems as well.

1228
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Maybe that was something that was originally being developed for the Vitality sensor, but when that kind of went away...

1229
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:38,000


1230
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Alright, maybe not.

1231
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Just Dance Disney Party on Xbox 360 in the Wii.

1232
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Woohoo!

1233
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Zero Escape Virtues Last Reward on 3DS in the Vita.

1234
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Let's see what else we got here.

1235
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Also this week, Myst on the 3DS. I think it's been delayed a few weeks.

1236
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Hopefully it's coming out this week.

1237
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Naughty Bear Double Trouble on PS3, and it's both mediocre Naughty Bear games.

1238
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:12,000
4's Horizon on Xbox 360 as well as the collector's edition of that.

1239
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
What else we got here?

1240
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits on the Vita.

1241
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
They are still trying, huh?

1242
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:23,000


1243
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Smart As on the... not Smart Ass, Smart As with one S on the Vita.

1244
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
That's also this week. That's supposed to be a brain training game.

1245
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And let's see here.

1246
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
They've got some controller kind of game combos.

1247
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So they're re-releasing the God of War Saga collection with a red dual-shot controller.

1248
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
They also have the infamous collection with a metallic blue controller.

1249
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And what was the last one? It was another one of their collections that they released with a silver controller.

1250
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I don't remember. It's not important. Those games already are out.

1251
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
And last but not least, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask on the 3DS.

1252
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out what's happening there. Quite a bit, actually.

1253
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
On the Xbox 360 this week, October 25th, you get Borderlands 2, 4's Horizon, Phantom of Inferno,

1254
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Zone of the Ender's HD edition, which I bet some people are very interested in.

1255
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Probably creaming their pants.

1256
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Exactly. Over on the PlayStation 3 this week, some of the same stuff. Zone of the Ender's HD edition.

1257
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Muv Luv.

1258
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
That sounds a little...

1259
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Muv Luv and Muv Luv Alternative are out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1260
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Is that Muv Luv or Muff Luv?

1261
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I almost said Muff Luv, but it is Muv Luv. I want to say it's an anime, but then again, yet again, here we are. I love this.

1262
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I'm sorry, this is too great. I gotta post a screenshot chat. I'm so sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see this.

1263
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:03,000
But look this game up. Muv dash Luv, okay? Because look at this. You got these Japanese girls in school outfits, duh duh duh duh duh,

1264
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
and this one is sucking on a hot dog in the corner, and then what the fuck is this bitch down here?

1265
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,000


1266
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,000


1267
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
She's in a barrel or a bundle of sticks or something.

1268
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I've gotta post that for the chatties. Hold on. Here you go.

1269
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
That is amazing.

1270
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That is absolutely amazing. I love it. Now wait, what's Muv Luv Alternative? Is that gonna be the one with the dudes on it? Let me see. Hold on.

1271
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
What? This isn't even the same game.

1272
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yes it is.

1273
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Now it's like chick with the sword. Yeah, I know it's the same, but that doesn't even look the same at all.

1274
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So maybe it's like the dark version.

1275
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Like one's all about love and one's about killing.

1276
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
One's like the cutesy, happy universe, the other's like the cyber babe universe.

1277
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Okay, I need help. Live chatters. You guys tend to know this stuff when I don't. What is Muv Luv? Somebody tell me.

1278
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I've gotta know now.

1279
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Like they don't say a lot about these games on the, uh, it's an adventure game.

1280
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Like does that mean- An adventure through panties.

1281
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Oh wait, here. Oh, there's a YouTube here.

1282
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Every anime game ever.

1283
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You know, that told me nothing.

1284
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Wow, that totally summed it up for me.

1285
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I know, it's like, oh, it's like an anime.

1286
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's even bigger, even more love, something. Play it again. No, no, don't play it.

1287
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Jason says it's a visual novel. Read Japanese porn.

1288
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Well, and to be fair, that is definitely a bundle of straw and not necessarily a, um, a barrel.

1289
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Alright, anyway, other games-

1290
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
For the record, I have bought a digital, a Japanese digital novel that they had in the U.S.

1291
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
They put it on Sega CD.

1292
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Oh, right, right.

1293
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Um, it was by the guy who created Cobra.

1294
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Uh, PlayStation 3 this week in Japan also gets Heartful Simulator Pochi Slot to Heart II.

1295
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Pochi Slot means, you know what, pachinko game.

1296
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Oh, Two Hearts, um, anime series.

1297
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Dark Souls with Atorias of the Abyss Edition, I'm assuming that's the Dark Souls DLC bundled with a regular game.

1298
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Borderlands 2, BioShock in a 2K collection, price reduction, I'm assuming gearing up for the sequel next year.

1299
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And Killzone Trilogy, also released on the PlayStation 3.

1300
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Again, these are all Japanese releases this week.

1301
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Street Fighter X Tekken in Japan,

1302
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
as well as next rev, Kaigo Fukushishi Shiken comes out as well.

1303
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Uh, on the Nintendo 3DS this week, um, AKB48 plus me?

1304
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Oh, good lord, it's like a little girl group.

1305
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Oh, is it?

1306
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah, AKB48 is like this, um, I guess it's kind of, um, this pop group that keeps cycling in, you know, kind of like Minuto was, you know?

1307
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Sure, sure.

1308
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Yeah.

1309
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Or, um, Morning Musume?

1310
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Yeah, kind of.

1311
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
But Morning Musume was also like a variety show.

1312
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Oh, right, right.

1313
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
But AKB48, like, they're like top 40 list everything, so.

1314
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Cool.

1315
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Well, there it is, your Japanese release dates.

1316
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1317
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
As soon as I get to the list.

1318
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Uh, let's see.

1319
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We have, well, on today, which means it's already yesterday there, um, I wanted to say it was Cairo, but it's KALRO.

1320
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
K-A-L-R-O.

1321
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Then on the 23rd, there's Hotline Miami.

1322
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Killzone HD and Medal of Honor Warfighter.

1323
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
On the 24th, Killzone Trilogy PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

1324
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
The 25th, Incredipede.

1325
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
And the 26th, Forza Horizon Roller Coaster Tycoon and Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.

1326
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Not to be confused with the TV show of the same name from the 60s.

1327
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
So, thanks to the chatters, did a little research.

1328
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Muv Luv, uh, it was an adult game on the PC in February of 2003.

1329
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
They redid these with the adult content removed on the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1330
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Boo.

1331
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
I know, right? What's the point?

1332
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Uh, Muv Luv Extra, Muv Luv Unlimited, and then Muv Luv Alternative came out a little later in 2006.

1333
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So I'm assuming this is some type of repackaged stuff, or it's like the game's re-, you know, revised, uprezzed, or whatever, reimagining.

1334
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So, yeah, cause, they, they show later release dates there, October 25th on the PlayStation 3.

1335
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
So, I guess this game's been around a little while.

1336
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I just have never played it, but now I kinda want to.

1337
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I gotta know, I gotta know what the girl in the straw is all about.

1338
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Alright, uh, let's see, that's release dates. A couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.

1339
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We have, by the way, been graced with Maruko.

1340
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Hello, Maruko. Did he finally decide to stop being shy?

1341
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yeah, he let me scratch his butt.

1342
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Oh, nice.

1343
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Stick his tail in the air, look at him, look at my butt.

1344
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
That's the closest I've ever seen him get to Loki. He must be getting used to it.

1345
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Alright, anyhow.

1346
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
We interrupt, smell like other, other cats.

1347
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
We interrupt this kitty appearance for more gaming news.

1348
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Alright, um, so let's talk a little bit about Steam Greenlight.

1349
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,000
They've got some new games that have been given the go-ahead, and those are, um, 21 new games, and this is kinda cool.

1350
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Some of these I actually backed on Kickstarter.

1351
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Um, let's see, After Fall, Insanity, Extended Edition, Air Buccaneers, Bloxscape, Contrast, Flyin', Folktale, Forge, the Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams, which is Project Giana.

1352
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
That was the one I backed, and it's fuckin' awesome. Cool.

1353
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Um, uh, Ginorm, Ginoria, I guess.

1354
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Nomoria? No, Nomoria, that's what it was.

1355
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Uh, Interstellar Marines, Lost Story, The Last Days of Earth, um, Miasamata, uh, Minor Wars 2081, Neo-Tokyo, which is a pretty awesome.

1356
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Um, uh, Source, uh, Mod, Octodad, Dadliest Catch, which is supposed to be pretty awesome.

1357
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Um, Perpetuum, Postal 2 Complete, The Secrets of, um, Grendia, The Intruder, The Stanley Parable, HD Remix, which is also supposed to be a pretty awesome Source game.

1358
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And Yogg Ventures, those are gonna be, um, the 21 new games that they're gonna be adding to the Steam store at some point soon.

1359
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:40,000
And then also, um, of course, the non-gaming area, which they added recently, is also added to Steam Greenlight as well, so now you can, uh, begin voting on submissions for other stuff that's not necessarily software.

1360
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And, uh, don't know what exactly is on there yet, but I'm probably gonna go poke around that at some point.

1361
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Um, and last but not least, they're also adding a new thing to Steam Greenlight, which is called Concepts.

1362
01:22:51,000 --> 01:23:01,000
It basically allows you to post your game without the $100 fee to gauge, kind of, interest in what people would want to, you know, if people would be even interested in your game.

1363
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And so if you get a lot of interest, then you may pony up the $100 to, you know, have it actually greenlit and put on the Steam store. So, that's kinda neat.

1364
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Sounds like that project's doing very well for them.

1365
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah, it sounds pretty cool.

1366
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Awesome, awesome. Alright, one more story for you guys, then we'll get into the classic game of the week.

1367
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Uh, this is another legal story. Uh, this is kinda, uh, wow.

1368
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Uh, Dave Rushton, who was the founder and president of Sensory Sweep Studios, they were in Utah, he got sentenced to 12 months in the slamma.

1369
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Fined $1.2 million in unpaid wages to more than 100 employees.

1370
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
This goes all the way back to a lawsuit from 2009 by the US Department of Labor.

1371
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Uh, apparently, employees claimed they were not paid in over 100 days for their work.

1372
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
The employees also alleged their 401k money had been stolen by the company.

1373
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Uh, Dave Rushton has already served jail time for other charges relating to the company.

1374
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:11,000
He pled guilty to one third degree felony charge of failing to file taxes and one second degree felony charge of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity.

1375
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
This is all according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

1376
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Uh, 200 hours of community service, 72 months probation.

1377
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
What did Sensory Sweep Studios do?

1378
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,000
They were doing ports and license games on the DS, such as Need for Speed Most Wanted, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends,

1379
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
uh, some console games like Alvin and the Chipmunks, or Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting for XBLA.

1380
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So that was some of the stuff that the studio did, and apparently, their people weren't getting paid for it.

1381
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
How not to run your business.

1382
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
You gotta pay your-

1383
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That's right, you gotta, you know, if you're gonna, you know, hire people, you do have to send them a paycheck at some point,

1384
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
or they might get angry, cause they're kinda waiting on you to pay them.

1385
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
So they can, like, pay their mortgage, you know, it's kinda things they wanna do.

1386
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
And you, you probably wanna pay your taxes, as well.

1387
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Especially, um, when you are, you know, the head of a company like that.

1388
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But, you know, you can just ride it off, you know, for your horse.

1389
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Or if you're, if you're a singer, you know, like Lauryn Hill, or, uh, who else got busted for tax evasion?

1390
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Like, they, they get caught, the guy who won Survivor, they all end up getting caught, so.

1391
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Uh, Wesley Snipes?

1392
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Yeah, that's right, that's right, that was a big one too.

1393
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But remember, you know, that's how they, that's how they got Capone.

1394
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
That's right, that's right.

1395
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
That's how they got Capone.

1396
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Alright, uh, let's travel to a classic time, maybe not as classic as Dark Soccer is referring to.

1397
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
But let's go back a few years, into gaming's history.

1398
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And a classic video game that Dark Soccer thinks, hey, brats, play this game, or else, I'll kill you.

1399
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
If you can find it, good luck.

1400
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Yeah, if you can find it. This, I, I honestly, I can say tonight's game, I had never fuckin' heard of this game.

1401
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I had never heard of this game.

1402
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Wesley, you've got the Namco collection, right?

1403
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah, I guess I missed it, somehow.

1404
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
No, not on PlayStation 1, I don't. I have the PlayStation 3 version with Arkaneo.

1405
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Oh, yeah.

1406
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Well, the game in question, and I'm going back to the original and its sequel, because I, I really can't mention one without the other,

1407
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,000
is, um, Valkyrie no Boken, Toki no Kagi Densetsu.

1408
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Um, the game, uh, title translates to The Adventure of Valkyrie, the Legend of the Time Key.

1409
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And it came out on, this is the Famicom version.

1410
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Right.

1411
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Which is sort of overhead-y, Zelda-ish, scroll-y.

1412
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
It actually, with the way the enemies appear, makes me think of Zelda 2.

1413
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Mm-hmm.

1414
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
And the other-

1415
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
But I love the music.

1416
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Can I just say the other English name people would know this by? Legend of the Valkyrie.

1417
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
No, that's actually the sequel.

1418
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Oh, my bad, okay.

1419
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Which is why I said two games.

1420
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Oh, okay. Oops.

1421
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah.

1422
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Um, so basically for the original one, you're in Marvel Land, and, uh, basically you have to, uh, get the Key of Time back from whoever stole it.

1423
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And, you know, it's kind of, it actually really has a lot in common with Dragon Warrior, and the real-time combat system of, uh, The Legend of Zelda.

1424
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Now, this was, um, it has absolutely no text in the game.

1425
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Um, there is a patch that changes the title screen if you've got, uh, the, uh, uh, like if you're playing it on an emulator.

1426
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And, um, look for the one that was done by, uh, DVD Translations. That one is the best.

1427
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Now, there is, um, a, uh, sequel.

1428
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And this is the one that people have probably heard of, is Valkyrie no Densetsu, which is, uh, The Legend of the Valkyrie.

1429
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And this came out in 1989, um, as an arcade game, and then it came out on the PC Engine in Japan.

1430
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And it is the sequel to the 1986, uh, Famicom game.

1431
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:54,000
This one also came out in the US as part of Namco Museum Volume 5, the O.

1432
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Um, and, uh, the PC Engine version came out on the Virtual Console in Japan.

1433
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And this one is basically a two-player game.

1434
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:11,000
The player one has Valkyrie, and the second one has Crenosandra, which was romanized actually as, uh, Zandra, or then X-A-N-D-R-A.

1435
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:21,000
And was named, um, Whirlo in the, uh, English version of, uh, the prequel, which was, uh, Zandra no Daibouken Valkyrie no...

1436
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Valkyrie Tonodei, I think is how it's pronounced. Um, who's a green lizard.

1437
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:36,000
And basically it's, you know, a lot of over, over the world, you know, scrolling, shooting, punching enemies in the face with your sword.

1438
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Going into little huts and buying stuff. It's, it's such an adorable game.

1439
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And, if people don't have the O from the Namco collection, which as I understand, the O is a little hard to find.

1440
01:28:50,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Um, get this game. It was a really, really fun little game, and it is fully translated and available in the U.S. if you can find the, uh, the Namco O.

1441
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Um, it actually though has a different ending from the arcade version. Um, with the home version you do have a level save.

1442
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And I actually have, um, Rob, I've got the Famicom version of the first game.

1443
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And I have the Hu-Card of this too. So I was very happy to pick those up.

1444
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And I mean, it's just really, it's a straightforward little, you know, adventure game.

1445
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,000
It's very Zelda slash Dragon Quest-y.

1446
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I don't know why, maybe it's the cartoony style or something, but I'm suddenly reminded of Whirlo.

1447
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Yeah.

1448
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Which, God, I love that game. I was just thinking about, like, I wanna play Whirlo again.

1449
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's like all the little monsters in the little Valkyrie are all chibi and adorable.

1450
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Yeah.

1451
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
And, I mean, but you can get super, uh, uh, powered up.

1452
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Now, you see how on this video here we're watching, um, how she's jumping from platform to platform?

1453
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,000
That used to always screw me up because I would think that it was over the regular ground and I'd walk off of them.

1454
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I mean, I know better, but the first time I tried to play it, it was actually pretty difficult.

1455
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I wanna check this video out over here. I'm hoping some dude isn't talking over this.

1456
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
But this says it's the main version, so I'm assuming this is just a direct arcade version.

1457
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I'm gonna hope it's without any dudes talking over it.

1458
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Let me see what happens here.

1459
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Yeah.

1460
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Okay, good.

1461
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh, this looks, okay.

1462
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
It's pretty much the same thing.

1463
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Yeah, it's, it's, uh, it definitely has that arcade style interface though, but okay.

1464
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
But, I mean, the PC Engine version is damn cool.

1465
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
The engine version is damn good.

1466
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Yeah.

1467
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Hmm, I'll have to check this out at some point.

1468
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Now, I'll tell you where I first heard about this game is I had, um, a, uh, gachapon, uh, capsule that was a little Namco figurine set.

1469
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Dan and I tried to collect all of them and one of them was a Valkyrie.

1470
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
And I was like, oh, this is pretty cool.

1471
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And then it turned out that, hey, there's this whole game and you should play it.

1472
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
And, oh, yeah, we actually have that because we have it on the Namco.

1473
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Oh, and it's just really cute, really fun.

1474
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
I suggest that everyone try to get your hands on it.

1475
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I mean, Valkyrie no Boken is pretty cool.

1476
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And, like I said, there was a prequel, um, released for the SNES called Zandra no Daiboken, Valkyrie tono, uh, Valkyrie tono dei, I think I'm pronouncing that right.

1477
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:26,000
And pulling this one up, that translates to, um, Zandra's Great Adventure, a counter with the Valkyrie.

1478
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
And that's the little green lizard man meeting up with the Valkyrie chick.

1479
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And that one, though, is a side-scrolling game.

1480
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It's a lot different.

1481
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I usually, I'd say that for any of them, my favorite of the three is the, um, Valkyrie no Densetsu.

1482
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
So, totally awesome game.

1483
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,000
And that's the classic game and I'm sticking to it.

1484
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1485
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:59,000
A couple of games there, but, uh, we'll say Valkyrie no Densetsu, uh, as that seems to be the one that, you know, if you're gonna go find this game, that's probably gonna be the one you're gonna find.

1486
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah, it's, if you wanna play it in English, it's on the Namco, uh, classics, which was, uh, the PlayStation version.

1487
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
And it's the letter O.

1488
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
There you go.

1489
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1490
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
That is a nice, obscure pick.

1491
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I like that.

1492
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Uh, alright, we're gonna take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1493
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:25,000
There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come for tonight, including your emails, or is it lack thereof, once again.

1494
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Uh, also we're gonna have some news on some things going on with Kickstarter.

1495
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,000
More lawsuit news and you are not gonna believe what happened with this PC release.

1496
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
The Fubo Question of the Week and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1497
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1498
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:56,000
We are live on this October the 21st of 2012 with the 478th episode of our show, uh, during the music break there.

1499
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:02,000
We can't play these on the podcast because, you know, copyright reasons and all that, but I will say we played a song there from 2nd Detsetsu 3.

1500
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:07,000
It was, uh, given the, uh, chatters a hard time trying to figure out what, uh, game that was from.

1501
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Did anybody ever play that when it had the translated cartridge? Yeah, I played that, too.

1502
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I played through about half of it.

1503
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Yeah, yeah. I still say, though, to this day, Secret of Evermore was sadly hazed and underrated by, uh, the folks here.

1504
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I thought Secret of Evermore wasn't a bad game, although I do understand it was a different, you know, it was the, the one square USA title that, you know, for whatever reason, people didn't seem to like it as much, but, anyhow.

1505
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Uh, Loki, before we get into rapid fire news, you were playing during the break there, this interesting music shooter game you were mentioning before?

1506
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Yeah, I had mentioned it on the show before because it was something like Kickstarter, it was called Rhythm Destruction, and since they got funded and their Kickstarting ended, um, basically, I think it was like 5 bucks, and you get the game, and the game, it's interesting because the way it plays, it's, it's a shooter, uh, like a top-down shooter, space shooter, I guess, but all the shooting is done as, like, a rhythm game.

1507
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:16,000
So, the enemies, you know, come on the screen, you see, like, a circle come around them, and you have to hit them with the, be the music, and it uses an Xbox 360 controller, so they're mapped to the face buttons, and then all the dodging of, like, bullets and stuff is done with the analog sticks, and your, you know, triggers are kind of like a boost type of thing.

1508
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:26,000
So, you're dodging stuff and having to do the rhythm game part, which is kind of really cool, and it's got music from, like, Kyle Wardner, I was playing one that was a Caw song, so.

1509
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
He shows up in the strangest places, music game-wise, doesn't he? Good for him, good for him.

1510
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yeah, but, uh, it's a pretty awesome game, so.

1511
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Gotta pay the bills!

1512
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Yeah, well, exactly, so I'm not really sure where, I think you can buy it off their website, um, I'm trying to remember where it is, because, you know, obviously, um, I don't think they, I think they're trying to get, um, onto the Steam store, I don't know if they've done it, I, oh yeah, here we go.

1513
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:01,000
RhythmDestruction.com, you can check it out, it's by a company called Curious Pandas, the, uh, group that did it, and I think you can, I think you can buy it.

1514
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Pandas, you say?

1515
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Yes, pandas, I think you can buy the game, um, maybe, let's see here, yeah, there's a buy it now on the website, I'm trying to see, $4.99 is all they're asking for, and you pay for it, with PayPal, they have, so.

1516
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Well, good luck!

1517
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
It's pretty awesome.

1518
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I like music games, I like shooters.

1519
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
It's worth it, I mean, it's a pretty awesome game, so, check it out.

1520
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Alright.

1521
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:35,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, brain.

1522
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Let's get into some rapid fire news before we get to the FUGL question of the week, which tonight is all about, zinga, it'll be fun, uh, Loki.

1523
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Alright, so, Ubisoft has this really weird tie-in, um, or promotional thing for Far Cry 3.

1524
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,000
What they're gonna be doing is actually promoting Far Cry 3 with a free Minecraft map and texture pack.

1525
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:08,000
The free pack, I guess, is coming, um, to PCs on the 26th, I think that's around the time that 1.4 update comes, and, um, they'll be adding Far Cry 3 locations and character skins.

1526
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And then, of course, the game, you know, Far Cry 3 comes out on the 4th in, uh, North America.

1527
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It's kind of a weird thing, but they have, they even did some promo screenshots where, you know, some of the screenshots from Minecraft, or, I'm sorry, Far Cry 3 have, like, Minecraft weapons in there.

1528
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Which makes you kind of wonder, is that gonna be something, like, hidden in the game that you can get Minecraft knives and stuff like that?

1529
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I was gonna say, could you, could you remind me, what exactly does Minecraft and Far Cry 3 have in common?

1530
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
They have wilderness?

1531
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
What, what relationship-

1532
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Dirt, Rob. Dirt and water.

1533
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
What relationship does Mojang have to Ubisoft? Like, this is-

1534
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Perhaps, among, you know, the tigers and other, you know, you know, uh, tribespeople and terrorists or whoever else you might find in the jungle, you're gonna find a creeper.

1535
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh, that's scary.

1536
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
That'd be awesome. Anyway, then, Borderlands 2.

1537
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Slenderman.

1538
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Slenderman.

1539
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Um, Black Ops 2 on the Wii U is not gonna have Call of Duty Elite.

1540
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Because all the other systems are gonna be getting Call of Duty Elite at launch, because they're kind of doing it as a free thing.

1541
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And instead of, you know, having to pay 60 bucks for all the perks of Elite, you can get everything for free and then you just pay 60 bucks for a map pack instead.

1542
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Or the subscription for the map pack, since that's really why they got Elite in the first place.

1543
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
However, the Wii U is not getting the support.

1544
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It says, we're currently evaluating options for Call of Duty Elite to support Nintendo's Wii U game system.

1545
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:43,000
However, Call of Duty Elite for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 will not support this platform when the game launches November 13th.

1546
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Which makes me wonder, what is borked about their fucking online?

1547
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Because that's kind of-

1548
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It makes me wonder, because Call of Duty Elite's kind of like this app thing.

1549
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Maybe they're not gonna allow these sort of like third-party apps, you know, for the Wii U dashboard or whatever.

1550
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Well, you know what didn't make the show roll tonight that's worth talking about?

1551
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Did you hear about the updates with Nintendo Voice Chat?

1552
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And how they're not selling a headset.

1553
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,000
They're gonna be third-party headsets.

1554
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And if you use the Nintendo Pro Controller, there's no space for a headset.

1555
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So you have to have your Wii pad with the headset and the Wii pad and then your Pro Controller.

1556
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Not looking good for Nintendo convincing me they understand online finally.

1557
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Not looking good.

1558
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I'm surprised we didn't put that story in here, because I could have gone on a whole tangent about that.

1559
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
But yeah, not thrilled by that news.

1560
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Not at all.

1561
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
It would be not so bad if that system supports Bluetooth and they have like Bluetooth headsets and stereo stuff as well.

1562
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Or that they're not doing a first-party headset because they're gonna support any headset.

1563
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Apparently on the gamepad they do have a spot for headphones, but not necessarily a headset type thing.

1564
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And apparently you can enable it, but at default it's disabled to use the microphone that's actually on the gamepad for chat.

1565
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I don't know.

1566
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
The fact we haven't heard much about it other than,

1567
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Hey, check out this like, I don't even know what the fuck they're calling it.

1568
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
The Mii Plaza or whatever the fuck their community thing is.

1569
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Hey, check this out.

1570
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Hey, guess what, you can leave messages for friends in games.

1571
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Okay, well what about accounts?

1572
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
What about like achievements and stuff like that?

1573
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Hey, check out this like Mii Plaza thing.

1574
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Hey, you can leave messages for friends in games.

1575
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
I think that's all it's gonna be.

1576
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I think that's it.

1577
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I think that and a shop and that's it.

1578
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I mean, really when you think about it, that's not much more than what they had on the Wii.

1579
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
They had it where you could share your Miis.

1580
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
They had it where you could see, you know, messages from your friends.

1581
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
And now they're kind of adding, you know, a thing where you can leave messages in game.

1582
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Yippee.

1583
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Or, you know, see what your friends, other people are playing.

1584
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Not necessarily friends, I guess.

1585
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

1586
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
But yeah, here's something else that's not coming to the Wii U version.

1587
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And, I mean, really the Wii U version is gonna be kind of similar to the rest of them.

1588
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I just think, I don't know.

1589
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I think something's borked with their online that that's how it is.

1590
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Because this should be something that should be easily implemented.

1591
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But it's not for whatever reason.

1592
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
And then last one, at least, Obsidian.

1593
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:24,000
They've concluded their Project Eternity Kickstarter at 3.9 million dollars raised.

1594
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:31,000
And I guess that's even more than Double Fine Adventures has gotten.

1595
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Because, remember, Double Fine Adventures had 3.3 million.

1596
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
That's right.

1597
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Wow, good for them.

1598
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
They beat that.

1599
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
And, of course, you know, I guess Planetary Annihilation was another one similar to that.

1600
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Or, you know, multi-million dollar raise.

1601
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
They got 2.2 million.

1602
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And the Wii U had 8.5 million.

1603
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
And the thing is, see, I almost backed this.

1604
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
But I saw that the game wasn't coming out until 2014.

1605
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
So, I'll wait, you know.

1606
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It's just not something I want to back.

1607
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
You need your games to be designed faster.

1608
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Well, it's just that's kind of a long ways.

1609
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
And I'm assuming that, you know, they're not necessarily going to hit their, you know, date for that stuff.

1610
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Because, like, for example, the Kickstarter I did for my very first Kickstarter, which was for VGHS, Video Game High School.

1611
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
They still haven't delivered the DVDs on that stuff yet.

1612
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
They're working on it.

1613
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
They've gotten it printed and they're signing copies.

1614
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
They had pictures of them signing the copies of it.

1615
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
But, you know, that was promised back in March.

1616
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I mean, they didn't even launch the series until, like, later in March.

1617
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
So, yeah.

1618
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I mean, the stuff gets delayed.

1619
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But, you know, two years from now.

1620
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Alright.

1621
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Well, how about free games?

1622
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
We like free.

1623
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And this is a very interesting sort of free game.

1624
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
This is being developed by NeoGAF members.

1625
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You know, the big popular gaming forum, right?

1626
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I guess they formed a studio called Grimoire Assembly Forge.

1627
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And they're creating this parody on modern shooters.

1628
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It's called Dude Bro 2.

1629
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
The actual title is,

1630
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Dude Bro, my shit is fucked up, so I gotta shoot-slice you too.

1631
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It's straight-up dog time.

1632
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Alright.

1633
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
It's based off of a meme that someone was, like, complaining about something.

1634
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
They're like, well, why don't you just go play Dude Bro 2?

1635
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And so someone's like,

1636
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So someone started, like, making character art and started doing, like, box art.

1637
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
It's like bungee ferret tossing.

1638
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Yeah, finally they decided to do it.

1639
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Somebody took the joke way too far.

1640
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I gotcha, I gotcha.

1641
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Apparently, though, here, you wanna talk about the joke going way too far?

1642
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
John St. John.

1643
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
You know John St. John?

1644
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
He is, he is Duke Nukem.

1645
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
He's the voice of Duke Nukem.

1646
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
He will be John Dude Bro.

1647
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,000
You need to play the song.

1648
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I think it's in the trailer.

1649
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Is this the little, the trailer song?

1650
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I think it's in the trailer.

1651
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Let me play a little clip of it here.

1652
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
It's straight-up dog time.

1653
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It gets in this.

1654
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
It's got a rap even.

1655
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,000
And it looks pretty awesome.

1656
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It looks very old school.

1657
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
At least in these cutscenes.

1658
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
It looks like Commander Keen or something.

1659
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
That's actually kinda rad.

1660
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Kinda rad.

1661
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
That's where Duke Nukem got its start, really.

1662
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
That's kinda cool.

1663
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Hey, I like free.

1664
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Alright, PlayStation All-Stars apparently have been hacked into Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

1665
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I don't know how this happened, but yeah, this is some modders.

1666
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
They developed the Smash Bros., but they actually have some of the PlayStation All-Stars.

1667
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But they put some other people into this as well.

1668
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Like, Niko Bellic from Grand Theft Auto 4.

1669
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
John Marston from Red Dead Redemption.

1670
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Lara Croft from Tomb Raider.

1671
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid.

1672
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I mean, it's a hack, so they don't have to worry about licensing or anything.

1673
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
They just put whoever the fuck they want in there.

1674
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Kazuya from Tekken, Tomba.

1675
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Isaac Clark from Dead Space.

1676
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Get this, Commander Shepard from Mass Effect.

1677
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
But it's Manshep.

1678
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So it doesn't count.

1679
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,000
It's a free mod, but again, you know, you will have to mod and do all that stuff.

1680
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I think those mods, I'm not sure with the whole character skins and models and stuff like that.

1681
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I think a lot of them you can do with just an SD card.

1682
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
You know, you need to, like, mod your system.

1683
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I think it's just done through, like, a hacked save type thing, so that might be one of those.

1684
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I don't know. I haven't really researched it too much.

1685
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Alright, and one other story about Nintendo Land.

1686
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
The final little mini games inside Nintendo Land have been announced.

1687
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Captain Falcon's Twister Race, where you hold the narrow end of the Wii U game pad upright to guide a high-speed wind-up vehicle towards the finish line.

1688
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Octopus Dance.

1689
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I couldn't say it without laughing.

1690
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
What?

1691
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
It's a single-player rhythm-based game.

1692
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:09,000
You use the game pad, you memorize the movement of the character on the screen, and re-enact the poses using the control sticks or the gyro sensor.

1693
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
And lastly, Yoshi's Fruit Cart.

1694
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
What, are you a fan of Yoshi's Fruit Cart, Dark Sakura?

1695
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
His name is Snort.

1696
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
You guide Yoshi's Cart towards the goal while collecting fruit on the way.

1697
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Oh, well, it's not just a clever name.

1698
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
You can see fruit on the TV, but not the game pad.

1699
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
It sounds like innovation to me.

1700
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,000
There you go.

1701
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:41,000
So, hey, so now you being a big fan of F-Zero, do you think that homage is worthy of, like, you know, you're gonna get the fans excited about F-Zero with this wonderful game?

1702
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I think they can stop being fucking cockteases is what they can do.

1703
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
That's a big-

1704
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I hope to hell that-

1705
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
That's a straight-up page, that's a page out of Capcom's book right there.

1706
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
That better be the secret project that Retro or whatever's working on is the new F-Zero.

1707
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Say, hey, F-Zero wind-up shit that you don't care about that we're at this point.

1708
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I give no fucks about anything else.

1709
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
It better not be Pilotwings or some shit.

1710
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
It better be fucking F-Zero.

1711
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
So I have to say-

1712
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
We already remade Pilotwings, we only-

1713
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Exactly!

1714
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
And Pilotwings, the remake of Pilotwings is fucking terrible.

1715
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Three goddamn things!

1716
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
I won't go that far.

1717
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Three fucking events.

1718
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Let's-

1719
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Way to go Nintendo, way to not, like, even put any effort in.

1720
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's Nintendo.

1721
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Nintendo doing the least bit of work so we can sell some shit that people will buy anyways because we're fucking Nintendo.

1722
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
There just needs to be a Captain Falcon game where all he does is punch people.

1723
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Now that would have been a classic minigame.

1724
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
That would have been great.

1725
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Falcon Punch! Falcon Punch!

1726
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Show me your move.

1727
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:46,000
So, um, Pikmin 3 is going to be on the Wii U and no one is excited.

1728
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Actually, that came from Iwata making that little announcement.

1729
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Next up, do you want to learn about video games at school, Rob?

1730
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
No! School sucks!

1731
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Bite me. I like school.

1732
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:08,000
There's a class that is at Rice University in Houston, Texas called Scandinavian Fantasy Worlds, Old Norse Sagas, and Skyrim.

1733
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
And basically it's, um, and I'm reading the quote here,

1734
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Introduce the students to fantasy as both psychological concept and the driving force in gamer culture

1735
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
by having students read selections from Old Norse and Old Icelandic sagas in translation

1736
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
and as they play different quests in Skyrim.

1737
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And it's pretty awesome because there's a part of the midterm where you get to give your best

1738
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
FUS RO DAH!

1739
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Last but not least, Just Dance 4 is going to have a song that you can download.

1740
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Ubisoft has announced this. It's going to be in this download content pack.

1741
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:57,000
It's going to be 240 Microsoft points per song, about 2 pounds, 4 bucks, something like that.

1742
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
And it's Gangnam Style.

1743
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Uh oh.

1744
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
So yeah. I have actually just introduced a friend of mine to the video last night.

1745
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So it was pretty funny.

1746
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
You know what you did, right?

1747
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Yeah, I know.

1748
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,000
You went there.

1749
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I have the album.

1750
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
All I have to say, look.

1751
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
The album's good.

1752
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I'm kind of already over this, but it was really weird to turn on the radio on a top 40 station nonetheless

1753
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and hear this song played, not as an act of parody, not as a lol listen to this, not as hey this is what the kids on the internet are.

1754
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
No, you hear up next, Psy with Gangnam Style.

1755
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I thought it was just, I thought it was PSY.

1756
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I think that most people were saying Psy.

1757
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Because in one of the songs, it does this little thing where they say the name of the person and it's P-S-Y.

1758
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Well, whatever.

1759
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,000
But actually it's a good album and I really like, I think the song's called Passionate Goodbye.

1760
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
It's a really good song.

1761
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
So I like the album.

1762
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
And that guy is just super adorable.

1763
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Have you heard the girl version?

1764
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
No, there's a girl version.

1765
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Basically everybody in the video, like a lot of the, well not everybody, but most of the people in the video are like real big celebrities in South Korea.

1766
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And all kinds of just big cameos in that video.

1767
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
And one of the girls that he's with in the video, she does one called Just My Style.

1768
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says just wait until he releases his US album.

1769
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
That is happening.

1770
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
He did get signed to a US label.

1771
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Buying it.

1772
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
That guy-

1773
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Justin Bieber's label too.

1774
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
That guy though, not Justin Bieber, but Psy, you have to admit he's super adorable.

1775
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Have you seen him in interviews and stuff?

1776
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
You just want to pinch his cheeks. He's so cute.

1777
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:55,000
And I mean that in a totally bro way.

1778
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:00,000
He's really just, I don't know, there's something about him. He's got a great personality.

1779
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
The album, seriously, I think it's like seven bucks on iTunes.

1780
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
And it was totally a worthwhile purchase for me, not just trying to sell it, but it was pretty good.

1781
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
I love driving to it. I'll put it that way. I drive very fast.

1782
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
No, I like the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack if I want to drive fast.

1783
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I wish they'd do another one of those games.

1784
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Anyway, let's see, where are we at? What time is it?

1785
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Oh, it's Fugu Question of the Week time. Hooray.

1786
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Facebook, smash it with Google+, and together you get Fugu.

1787
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
And that's where our segment comes from.

1788
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
We ask a question in our fan communities every week and we read some of our favorite answers.

1789
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
The question was short and sweet tonight.

1790
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Obviously, we've been talking a little bit about Zynga and some of the things that have been going on over there.

1791
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,000
The question this week is, in ten years, how do you think people will remember Zynga?

1792
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
What will their mark on history look like?

1793
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
I want to know, and I'm looking for some serious answers here.

1794
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I know some of you want to take the cheap, easy way out and say, lol poop.

1795
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
But, you know, I'm really curious. What are they going to be remembered by?

1796
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Let's see, going to Google+.

1797
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Retertainment says, I believe the answer to this question will depend on how many of the people who currently actively play Zynga games will, in ten years' time, succumb to dementia.

1798
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Okay, it's ten years. Ten, not forty-five. It's ten.

1799
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Let's see, Legend668 on Google+, says, Zyng who?

1800
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Already fading from my mind.

1801
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Monster B says, what was Zynga?

1802
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:38,000
And Sean F says, no, people may not remember Facebook.

1803
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
That's actually a good point, though.

1804
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,000
How much longer is the Facebook fad going to last?

1805
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Their stock sure doesn't seem to indicate it will last much longer. I don't know.

1806
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
But people can't stop using it.

1807
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Anyway, if you want to see more answers from Google+, head to our community, Orange Lounge Radio, on Google+.

1808
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Those are some of the answers tonight.

1809
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Going to Facebook and some of the answers we got on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio for our Frugal Question of the Week about Zynga.

1810
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Sorry, I'm waiting for it to load.

1811
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
There we go. Oh yes, I remember this story from Bobby Black Wolf.

1812
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,000
I know I'll forever remember them as the only company I ever said no to when their recruiter contacted me.

1813
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
It's probably for the best.

1814
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Code Man says, a company that made a very addictive crack kind of addicting games and secretly taking our money like a reverse tooth fairy.

1815
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Dude, you've given them money?

1816
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Secretly?

1817
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
You just admitted something on the show. I'm just kidding.

1818
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Lauren T says, a company that decided that getting new users is more important than fixing the games they already had correctly and almost completely alienating its loyal players.

1819
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:00,000
That's a very good answer from Lauren. A company that alienated its loyal players. How not to do...

1820
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Why are you showing me animated gifs while I'm trying to do this segment?

1821
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Because this is in the chat room.

1822
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
What is...

1823
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
There's a football player doing the gunk and stuff.

1824
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Oh, is he real?

1825
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I didn't even catch that at first. Alright, can I read the answers from Facebook?

1826
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Yeah, I guess.

1827
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Red The Hay says, it'll be remembered as that company that made those games like those other games but wasn't game loft.

1828
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:31,000
AZHP says, I'm guessing if people still talk about them in 10 years, they'll talk about Zynga the same way that people who talk about Neopets do now.

1829
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Remember when Neopets was a thing, Dark Sakura?

1830
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Lord, I do. I played it.

1831
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Well, we were talking about how technology is like advancing so fast and stuff that in 10 years, who knows if that type of gaming will be even popular because they'll have stuff that's like comparable to what we're playing on consoles right now on the mobile devices.

1832
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Acidic Vampire says, is that a legendary Pokemon?

1833
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Tiger Claw says, in 10 years, they will be known as the one company to single-handedly destroy the concept of social gaming.

1834
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
That's pretty powerful stuff there, but perhaps.

1835
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Burr responded saying, we'll remember Zynga the same way we remember MySpace compared to 10 years ago.

1836
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Although, honestly, to be in a retentive here for a minute, was MySpace really a thing 10 years ago or was that when Friendster was the big deal?

1837
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
10 years is a long time in tech terms.

1838
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
You know I never used Friendster.

1839
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Did you? Really?

1840
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Yeah, I never used it.

1841
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Never used it?

1842
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Never.

1843
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Let's see. Matt J said, they will forever be remembered by me as that company with those horrible apps I had to block, which was responsible for the downturn of Facebook.

1844
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Let's see. Other answers here.

1845
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Steven M says, Farmville, that's it.

1846
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Hitstun says, Zynga taught us an all-important lesson. If you want your game to make the big bucks, it doesn't have to be original or good, it just has to be annoying.

1847
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And end with Ville.

1848
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And end with Ville.

1849
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
I'm going to read this long answer here from Matt J because it's pretty good.

1850
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Truthfully, in my opinion, they'll certainly be remembered. I feel that they'll be remembered for a couple of things.

1851
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Well, really, just for Farmville and the legacy it created.

1852
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
It helped to create a market for Facebook games, really for social network games in general.

1853
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I mean, I do believe there were some before Farmville, but they never really got the light of day they have now until Farmville.

1854
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Zynga will be remembered in the end for creating the Farmville phenomenon and helping to create a new gaming platform.

1855
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Farmville is the game that got so many into Facebook gaming.

1856
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Surely there will be some footnotes in the history books for Zynga seemingly stealing ideas from others and the lawsuits involved.

1857
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Sure, some will remember the foaming hatred some in the gaming community had and have for Zynga.

1858
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
However, most will simply remember one little word, Farmville.

1859
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
That will be the biggest thing Zynga will be remembered for.

1860
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Farmville and helping launch the Facebook social network gaming phenomenon.

1861
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Pretty good answer there that, you know, hate them all you want now, but when you look back on history, it's really going to be about Farmville and the social stuff.

1862
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Good answers from everybody. I'm sorry I didn't have time to read them all, but a whole lot of you responded tonight.

1863
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to read all of the answers, which were very good.

1864
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I'll remember the day that someone drew a tank through their business and spelled out Sega in bullets.

1865
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
What?

1866
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Oh, I'm sorry. That hasn't happened yet.

1867
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Don't say that kind of stuff on this show. I don't want the po-po coming over.

1868
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I think it would be, you can remember them by the fact that they probably popularized freemium gaming and made it a little bit more popular as far as like a business model that everybody's going to start using.

1869
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I'll remember the day that I blocked Farmville and I'll remember every other day that Facebook has unblocked Farmville.

1870
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'm a little ashamed to say that I did play Farmville.

1871
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I will tell you this.

1872
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I played it to impress a guy.

1873
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I never played Farmville. Never touched it. And when I blocked it, I never got another thing for it.

1874
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
However, my mother would keep saying, why are my cows dying or something like that?

1875
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I'd be like, you don't have cows, mom. You've never loo- oh.

1876
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Cows dying now. Digimon, you know, dying.

1877
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Hey, I love Digimon.

1878
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I like Digimon better than Pokemon. I'll play that one.

1879
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Tamagotchi? Is that what you're trying to think of? Yeah.

1880
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Alright, let's do some more long news, Lowkey.

1881
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Neopets. Anyways.

1882
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So, Ubisoft.

1883
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Wait, hold on. I gotta correct something Blackwool said in chat.

1884
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Blackwool said, Alan likes Farmville. Confirmed. No, this was pre-Alan.

1885
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
This was another guy several years ago when Farmville first came out.

1886
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
And he was really into it. And I was like, alright, I'll try this.

1887
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And then it's like, oh, I have to keep checking on these blueberries and shit every three hours and whatever.

1888
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Which is why I refuse to do the farming in WoW.

1889
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
He really- I can talk about this now because, you know, he's a thing of the past.

1890
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
But he really liked the Farmville song.

1891
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Which is so stupid because it's like the same five notes over and over again in different keys.

1892
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Like, I remember joking about having a 70 minute soundtrack to Farmville and it was just those same five notes over and over.

1893
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Lord. You know, I've never heard that. Why are you staring at me like that, Lowkey?

1894
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Because I've never heard of that song. You've never heard the Farmville song?

1895
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
No. Neither have I.

1896
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I would like to not hear that song.

1897
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I'm sorry. You can't go all this time and then be all like, oh, I have never heard the song.

1898
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
And then not expect somebody to not play the song.

1899
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
I'm totally expecting an awesome song.

1900
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Oh, this is like-

1901
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Wait, that's like all different now. When did they modernize it?

1902
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,000
It used to be just these little tones that would play over and over again.

1903
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Oh, forget it.

1904
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Yay!

1905
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
That was fantastically non-generic at all.

1906
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Somebody must know the old Farmville songs. I know I'm not the only one that played Farmville back in the day.

1907
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Well, that's why I refuse to do the farming in WoW.

1908
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Not gonna do it. It's not happening.

1909
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Alright.

1910
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I don't give a damn about your scallions.

1911
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:13,000
So Ubisoft, I guess they were ones to swear off DRM in their games or something like that.

1912
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Or they patched it out for the games that had it.

1913
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Well, they apparently didn't do that all the way.

1914
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Because Rocksmith just got released this week.

1915
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:28,000
And the PC version missed having the codes to activate the game inside the box.

1916
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Oops.

1917
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Can't play the game. No activation code.

1918
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Of course, people are going, what the fuck?

1919
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:46,000
So they went to Rocksmith forums and you have to go to a customer support site, fill out a form, attach a clear digital image of your receipt.

1920
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Showing the store details and the product.

1921
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
And your credit card number, heh heh heh.

1922
01:59:52,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And, you know, I don't know. It's just, it's kind of stupid though that they have this problem in the first place.

1923
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That the serial wasn't part of, like, the game manual or something like that.

1924
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Wasn't printed somewhere in the game.

1925
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Oh, hey, you know, no one QA'd the fact that these games went out without codes in them.

1926
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Sounds like kind of a problem when your game just doesn't work.

1927
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Maybe you should patch out the authentication code then since you fucked up.

1928
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
That might be a good way to do it, yep.

1929
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:32,000
The problem with that is that you're putting the responsibility on the consumer and that's the wrong way to keep your fans.

1930
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I mean, I don't know how many people will be pirating that game anyways.

1931
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Because, I mean, you're talking about such a niche, niche niche niche thing.

1932
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:45,000
You're talking about a game that requires an electric guitar, that requires a special connector.

1933
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
So, even if you did pirate the game, you'd still have to go to the store to get that USB connector.

1934
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,000
You know, to plug your guitar into your computer.

1935
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
And, it's just, it's a PC title. It's not even the console title.

1936
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
It's, that is, like, niche niche niche, you know.

1937
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I mean, yeah, people are gonna, some people probably will pirate it because they can.

1938
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:14,000
But, dude, I mean, come on. I don't think that this is the type of game that necessarily needs that kind of DRM in there.

1939
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I don't know. It's just, it's a little ridiculous.

1940
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Yeah, especially when you make money in so many other ways with this game like this that has the peripherals and everything.

1941
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,000
You know, it's just, it's, again, I think I'm with you. It's kind of useless to pirate this game.

1942
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It's probably.

1943
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
To play it with the keyboard is ridiculous.

1944
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
You can't.

1945
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Then there, well, don't ever tell a hacker they can't do something because you'll hack the, you can remap the keyboard or whatever.

1946
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
But, still, it's pointless. It's absolutely pointless.

1947
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Yeah, you have to have a guitar. I mean, so, it's just, I don't know, it's just kind of ridiculous that they would even have that.

1948
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
But, they did, and, of course, they said,

1949
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:59,000
We apologize for the inconvenience caused and will provide any affected customers with the GuitarCade time saver,

1950
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:07,000
which gives players instant access to all the Rocksmith minigames and Ubisoft, well, I guess it's one of the forum mods.

1951
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:15,000
So, cool, you get free DLC to unlock shit in your PC game to make up for the fact that they fucked it up.

1952
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:23,000
And, hey, Assassin's Creed 3 is right around the corner on, well, actually about a month away on PC, so, more fun.

1953
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Yeah, you know, if you're one of those people, you know, word of mouth is really gonna hurt them in this case and that's really unfortunate.

1954
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Well, at least this is the title they fucked up on in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry 3.

1955
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Still, you know, I think it's worse in this case. I think it's worse when it's a niche title like this that really is relied on word of mouth, I think, to gain popularity.

1956
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I mean, and you should be thanking these people left and right for buying your game on PC anyways, because, once again, this is such a niche game.

1957
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I don't see a lot of people on PC buying this game. I mean, it just doesn't seem like something that they would purchase.

1958
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I mean, I guess there's gonna be people that make music on their PC and stuff and maybe, but, you know, they wouldn't necessarily be wanting to learn guitar or something.

1959
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I don't know, it's just... it's weird.

1960
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:14,000
And Ubisoft, come on! You would think that you would figure out this whole DRM thing. I mean, you've fucked this up before.

1961
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Driver, um, what was it? Driver vs San Francisco. Have you not learned? Apparently, the answer is yes, you have not learned.

1962
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Very unfortunate. Well, speaking of the continued adventures of Ubisoft, Ubisoft actually filed a $1 million lawsuit yesterday against BEP Music LLC.

1963
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Guess what BEP stands for? The Black Eyed Peas, the band. You know them? Boom Boom Pow, all that stuff.

1964
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:55,000
They actually wrote a song that uses the days of the week as lyrics. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. And that is a top 40 song.

1965
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Well, if Friday can do it, we're gonna make our songs seven times better.

1966
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Anyhow, the Black Eyed Peas experience, I don't know if you know, but this was one of the dancing games that Ubisoft put out, and it was on the various consoles, probably PC as well.

1967
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Oh, it was just Wii and 360? They didn't even do it for PlayStation 3? Or PC? None of that?

1968
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
No one gave a shit about PC.

1969
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Alright, well, whatever. Anyhow, it was supposed to happen on iOS, but apparently BEP breached the company's contract.

1970
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:30,000
The contract stated that the band agreed to approve or disprove the iOS version within 10 business days of request.

1971
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:36,000
However, the music company failed to acknowledge requests for approval despite repeated attempts.

1972
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Ubisoft claims they spent $233,000 developing the iOS game. That's how much it costs to develop a game like this, huh? I was just curious.

1973
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:53,000
They think that combined with a loss of profits, this amounts to a total of $1 million in damages.

1974
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Ubisoft did not own the game or the company in question or whatever, but BEP only owns the Black Eyed Peas trademark, so you kinda have to put two and two together to figure out where this is.

1975
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:15,000
So, uh, interesting. Maybe the band felt burned by the other games and didn't want to do it? Or maybe they just felt they were too good for it?

1976
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I don't think it was that bad. I mean, granted, this year we have the Hip Hop Dance Experience.

1977
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I think it is what it is, type of thing. So...

1978
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I mean, it didn't look like a terrible game, but I didn't play it. I saw video footage of it and it looked pretty interesting. I'm just not a fan of Black Eyed Peas, so...

1979
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So we are having livestream issues, by the way, for those folks that are listening live. It just reconnected.

1980
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
It's comcastic.

1981
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I know. We were doing so well tonight, too, but again, if you guys have any extra stuff going, be sure it's killed.

1982
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Alright, um, let's move on to Dark Sakura.

1983
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
To me?

1984
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Yeah, your story.

1985
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Oh, yeah, that. Um, how about some more Wii U stuff?

1986
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Square Enix game. There's going to be a Square Enix game that's done by the developer that's porting Mass Effect 3 to the Wii U.

1987
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:14,000
It says it's a triple-A Square Enix port, but who knows what it is?

1988
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:21,000
There's actually, um, it was actually listed on a LinkedIn page, which has since been, uh, changed.

1989
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
So, who knows? But it will be a Squeenix game.

1990
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Tomb Raider.

1991
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Eh, probably.

1992
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Be my guess.

1993
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
It's a, I don't care, because I'm not getting a Wii U.

1994
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
You think so, huh?

1995
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I, well, I don't think Hitman's going to be coming out, because they'd be kind of late for it if they just started development on it.

1996
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
So, Tomb Raider makes sense, because it's coming out about a year from now.

1997
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Well, they also mentioned a possibility of a Deus Ex.

1998
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Uh, once again, that would be really delayed. I mean, Deus Ex came out last year.

1999
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
If Arkham Asylum, or if it's in Arkham City.

2000
02:06:54,000 --> 02:07:00,000
That's a cash-in on the beginning, but no one's going to want to play a game that came out three years ago that just has some different controls in it.

2001
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Well, Crystal Dynamics actually already denied Tomb Raider, saying that it would have to be completely redesigned.

2002
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
So, it would be a much later released game.

2003
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:15,000
It could still be, uh, Deadlion and Riptide, because I think they're publishing for, uh, that South Peak game.

2004
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Alright, ready for my tinfoil hat?

2005
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,000
What about, I know this is going to be crazy talk, what about Final Fantasy XIV?

2006
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Uh...

2007
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Well, the new one could be good. We still don't know.

2008
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Yeah, monkeys could fly out of my butt.

2009
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
I guess.

2010
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Anything's possible, right?

2011
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
But once again, though, I mean, we're talking about a system that can't fucking handle Call of Duty Elite.

2012
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Or the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 redo.

2013
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
If I start farting primates, then I'll believe it.

2014
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
I don't know.

2015
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Once again, though, you were talking about a game that's probably going to be coming out next holiday.

2016
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
It could be very well a title they haven't announced yet.

2017
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I mean, there's...

2018
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Let's see, I'm trying to think of...

2019
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I mean, they have Tomb Raider. There's other Square Enix titles.

2020
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
It could be anything. Just use your imagination.

2021
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Chocobo Racing 2!

2022
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Yes!

2023
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Hey, that'd be awesome.

2024
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
That would be awesome.

2025
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
I might get a Wii U if there's Chocobo Racing.

2026
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Make it happen. Hell yeah.

2027
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Alright, let's move on.

2028
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Urgis 2? No.

2029
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Alright. Anyways, um...

2030
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
So there was some...

2031
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,000
You know, we talk a lot about Kickstarter, and there's always a conspiracy theory of...

2032
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Or not even conspiracy theory, but the reality that some of these projects may not turn out well.

2033
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:38,000
So that kind of happened to be the case of one of the Kickstarter projects that actually did get funded.

2034
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
It was a turn-based haunted house game called Haunts.

2035
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And it was being done by a company called Mob Rules Games.

2036
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
And, you know, they raised...

2037
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I forget what it was. It was like...

2038
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Maybe $20,000?

2039
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
And the problem is, though, that...

2040
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Now that it's been a few months or whatever...

2041
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
All of his programmers quit.

2042
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And apparently all the money has been spent because, you know, $20,000 is not a whole lot.

2043
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:13,000
But, at least it seems like kind of a null branch from the developer.

2044
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
He says he's still going to continue working on the game.

2045
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,000
And that if there's anybody that's seeking a refund, he will refund them out of his own pocket.

2046
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
So that's kind of cool, at least.

2047
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
And things happen, I guess, but at least he's still moving on.

2048
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Still has a lot of people jumping on here going,

2049
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Here's the dark side of Kickstarter!

2050
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Here's the problem with Kickstarter!

2051
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
No, that's always...

2052
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
They stole the money!

2053
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
They didn't steal the money.

2054
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
There have been a few people that just kind of, like, took the money and ran, but...

2055
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:47,000
The majority of people, like, actually have a product that they want to put out and stuff.

2056
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:51,000
And, you know, once again, you've just got to do your research.

2057
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
That's the, you know...

2058
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Like, for example, that guy that wanted $1,000,000 for an MMO.

2059
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,000
And, you know, had no idea of what...

2060
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Just, like, it was such a generic,

2061
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
I want to make an MMO that's going to be bigger than WoW.

2062
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:11,000
And it's got things and races and items.

2063
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
And if you pledge this much, you're going to get a special item.

2064
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
And I own a baseball...

2065
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Or, I used to play baseball, so I know I can do this.

2066
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Oh, wait. Sorry.

2067
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
No, no.

2068
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Wrong case. Sorry.

2069
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
But, no, you just have to do the research.

2070
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Like, obviously, Kickstarter stuff that, you know...

2071
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
There's a lot of developers that have pedigrees in developing games and stuff like that.

2072
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,000
They're putting stuff on Kickstarter.

2073
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
You just have to, you know, be aware of what you're Kickstarting.

2074
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I mean, some of these companies, like the one I...

2075
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
You know, like I said, the rhythm instruction game.

2076
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:40,000
It's just like some people that, you know, some guys that are making a game.

2077
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
And you don't know if that's going to be done, but they weren't asking for much money.

2078
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,000
And, sure enough, they got the game out.

2079
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
So, I mean, you can't just go,

2080
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Oh, they're all going to fail.

2081
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
But just keeping that in mind, you know.

2082
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Remember, even if you do pledge money to Kickstarter,

2083
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
you always have up until that close date to change your mind.

2084
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
I've done that before with stuff, you know,

2085
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I was like, eh, I don't want to Kickstart this.

2086
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And you can take your money out.

2087
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,000
You just pledge nothing.

2088
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
So, that's that.

2089
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
If you don't want to run the risk, then don't pledge.

2090
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Alright.

2091
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Well, moving on to one of my favorite people in gaming, Tetsuya Mizuguchi.

2092
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:22,000
He's the former head of Q Entertainment.

2093
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,000
So this kind of makes me sad that we're talking in past terms here.

2094
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Because he was the mind behind games like Rez, Luminous, Child of Eden, and Space Channel 5.

2095
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
He has now taken a position at Keio University.

2096
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
He's a project professor.

2097
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
He will remain at Q as a spokesperson,

2098
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
but it sounds like this is kind of his new path here now.

2099
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Keio did make an announcement about this

2100
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
and noted that his position in the Graduate School of Media Design

2101
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
will allow him to continue to produce games

2102
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
and further expand his expertise in the field of media design

2103
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
and innovative content production.

2104
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So it does appear he still will be working on games,

2105
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
although there's only so many hours in a day, people,

2106
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
but no longer in the commercial area.

2107
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,000
So, yeah, I'll be interested to see what he comes up with next.

2108
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I'm glad at least he still has some ties to the gaming industry,

2109
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
and I guess that's kind of cool that he can influence the future

2110
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
because I think he's had a lot of great ideas.

2111
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I love the stuff he's done for music games.

2112
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Axidef does make a good point.

2113
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Mizuguchi Sensei.

2114
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
That's what we have to call him from now on.

2115
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Good point, good point.

2116
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,000
So, yeah, good luck to him in that new career.

2117
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
At least, you know, as much as we might be sad that, you know,

2118
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
he'll have less time for games, although they're staying,

2119
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
he'll still do games.

2120
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
It's in grading papers.

2121
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Yeah, he'll be influencing more people.

2122
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Oh, come on.

2123
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Noob, noob, noob, win.

2124
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:48,000
If it's anything like it is here, the TAs grade all the papers.

2125
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,000
You and I both know that.

2126
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
All right.

2127
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Moving on.

2128
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
You should eat all your popcorn.

2129
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Popcorn's good.

2130
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
You should eat popcorn.

2131
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Let's get to the mailbag.

2132
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I'm eating yours.

2133
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Every week you guys send us e-mails.

2134
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2135
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
And we actually got some e-mails this week, right?

2136
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Kind of.

2137
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Woo.

2138
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

2139
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Darkstalker's going to dive into the mailbag head first

2140
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
and pull out some e-mails.

2141
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
She thinks, hey, I'm going to read this e-mail.

2142
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:18,000
This one's long, so I'm going to read it first.

2143
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
Dear OLR, I just wanted to chime in with my thoughts

2144
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
in a recent game I completed, that game being Final Fantasy 13-2.

2145
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Originally, I played the demo when it was released on the PS3,

2146
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
and I wasn't drawn into the game at all.

2147
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
They didn't really explain anything that was going on story-wise,

2148
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
and it seemed to make the game out to be a Final Fantasy filler.

2149
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Sorry, I've got corn.

2150
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:43,000
I also read some reviews that spun the game in a negative light,

2151
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
such as saying that the music in the game was terrible,

2152
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
and that one reviewer in particular had to turn off the sound

2153
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
for a final boss fight.

2154
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Boy, was I surprised when I picked up the game at Best Buy Summer Sale

2155
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
and finally put it in my system.

2156
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
The story turned out to be really interesting,

2157
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
with time travel being an interesting mechanic

2158
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,000
as a method to traveling to different areas.

2159
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Rob, if you haven't, you need to play this game to the end.

2160
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I haven't played to the end, but I've played a really good chunk of it,

2161
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
and it is a good game.

2162
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I do need to beat it.

2163
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
That brings me to a question for the host.

2164
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Have you ever played a game demo that you ended up not liking at all,

2165
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
only to play the full game later on and absolutely love it?

2166
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Except I started hating it again, but I beat it.

2167
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I thought Parappa was kind of stupid at first,

2168
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
and then I ended up loving it.

2169
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Well, in reverse, Nintendogs.

2170
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I loved the demo, and then the full game came out,

2171
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
and I was like, that's it?

2172
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,000
So I can only think of the reverse.

2173
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I can't think of where I've hated a demo and really loved the game.

2174
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:51,000
I'd probably have to go back to the PS1 days to think of something.

2175
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I can't think of anything, because if I don't like the demo,

2176
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
why am I going to buy the full game?

2177
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Halo.

2178
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
The original Halo.

2179
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
The first time I played it, I wasn't that into it.

2180
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I played it at a party.

2181
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I thought it was the best thing ever.

2182
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I don't know if that was really a demo, but that's the best answer I got.

2183
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Also, I've found that after hearing from multiple friends

2184
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
of how much they dislike Final Fantasy 13,

2185
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
yes, the first game,

2186
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
then their impressions rub off on me,

2187
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
making me skeptical if I would even like the sequel.

2188
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
If I would have liked the sequel, sorry.

2189
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Thinking back on it, however, I really loved 13.

2190
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Yes, the battle system was exactly my favorite,

2191
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,000
but it was far from enough to make the game not enjoyable.

2192
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Now for our final question.

2193
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Has a popular opinion about a game that you played

2194
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
had an impact on how you felt about it,

2195
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
or do you not let what people say affect your gaming experience?

2196
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
I honestly try not to let what people say.

2197
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I try not to, but if I really dislike a game

2198
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
and I go read that the popular opinion is very good,

2199
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I do kind of go, did I miss something?

2200
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Did I not understand something?

2201
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
But that doesn't happen very often.

2202
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
That's all I have to say for now.

2203
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Thanks for reading, Osprey.

2204
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I'm going to cry again.

2205
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
P.S. It's really sad to hear about Jamie's dear cat, Shermie.

2206
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I'm sure she led an awesome life with her owners

2207
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
and will be missed, rest in peace, hearts.

2208
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Yeah, she led an awesomely lazy life.

2209
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
That's what a lot of listeners are thinking right now.

2210
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Yeah, I miss my baby.

2211
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Okay, this is from Taibon.

2212
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Taibon here, e-mailed you a few years ago,

2213
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:30,000
and I thought I'd report back now what we're doing here in the heart of Africa.

2214
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
My Xbox was red-ringed a while ago,

2215
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
so it's been all PlayStation here at the household.

2216
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
It's very hard finding new consoles here.

2217
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Oh, Borderlands and Skyrim marathons recently for me.

2218
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Hope you're all doing well.

2219
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Taibon, this message was brought to you by Dirt Garden,

2220
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
home of the never-ending empty plates.

2221
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Did we do research the first time to see if this was a legit thing

2222
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
or if it was a troll?

2223
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I think we found out, yeah, this guy's legit there.

2224
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Didn't he send a picture or something?

2225
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Yeah.

2226
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Well, thank you for checking in, sir.

2227
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Thanks for still listening even after.

2228
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Skeptical.

2229
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
And every time I read your e-mail, I think of that song.

2230
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:04,000
I remember the rains in Africa.

2231
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Toto.

2232
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Toto, thank you. I was like, what's that song? Yeah.

2233
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
I've heard a really good cover of it at a concert.

2234
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Did you?

2235
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,000
By a group, a men's acapella group called Straight No Chaser.

2236
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Is it something local?

2237
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
No.

2238
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
They're kind of the big thing.

2239
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
They do tours and a lot of them were, I think,

2240
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Broadway performers and various singers and other things.

2241
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
But actually look up the Straight No Chaser version

2242
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
because it's really, really good.

2243
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Let's see.

2244
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I'm trying to, well, I want to just make sure our listener,

2245
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Oh, God.

2246
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I'm going to shake myself.

2247
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Ads are going to be the death of me.

2248
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
It's terrible radio.

2249
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:52,000
You would think one of these days I'm going to learn to load this stuff in advance.

2250
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
And yes, I know all the lyrics to the song.

2251
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:56,000
That's it.

2252
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
You were right there.

2253
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Was it?

2254
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Yeah.

2255
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Right.

2256
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Oh, there it is. There it is. Here we go.

2257
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
That's...

2258
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
And yes, I know this one by its harmony.

2259
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,000
Is that song in rock band?

2260
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
No, but it should be.

2261
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
It should be.

2262
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Dear Harmonics.

2263
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Last email.

2264
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2265
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Turtle.

2266
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Here's an interesting dilemma I'm in.

2267
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Oh, no.

2268
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,000
It's a dilemma.

2269
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I'm interested in a new PC game that's just come out on Steam, X-Com.

2270
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I like the demo, but I don't think it's worth 50 bucks.

2271
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
So I can either get it by other means or wait for the Christmas sale or not get it at all.

2272
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,000
My question is, if I wait for all PC games to go on sale on Steam,

2273
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
will publishers stop making PC games because of the lack of release sales?

2274
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Or will they notice if people like me will wait for those games to go on sale?

2275
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I want to send the publishers a message that their games are too expensive,

2276
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
but I still want to support the game makers.

2277
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:13,000
And I don't want the lack of release sales to deter them from making the games to begin with.

2278
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
What do you think, your loyal turtle in Philly, serious turtle?

2279
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Here's a reality check.

2280
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
The game won't be $9.99 when the Christmas sale comes around.

2281
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
The game will be like, what is it, 60 now?

2282
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
It'll be like 30.

2283
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
It'll be like 30.

2284
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Best 30 or 35.

2285
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:33,000
And that's like best case scenario because I don't even think Skyrim went that low that fast.

2286
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
So, you know, don't assume that the game...

2287
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Now, I certainly am not going to encourage you to go to more nefarious means

2288
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,000
because then you certainly are sending the wrong message to the publisher.

2289
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And plus, if you do that, I don't think you'd get to do the online play and all that stuff,

2290
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,000
which I think is supposed to be...

2291
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I used to love the old X-Com games.

2292
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I really need to look into this new one.

2293
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I've been playing all this other crap, so...

2294
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I think they're still going to make their money.

2295
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Yeah.

2296
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I think it's certainly better that you wait for the holiday sale than pirate it.

2297
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I mean, that's certainly the better of the two options.

2298
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Are you sending the wrong message by waiting?

2299
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I'm going to actually say not necessarily

2300
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:19,000
because you're not the gamer that was like pre-ordering this,

2301
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
eager about this the first day, had to have your hands on it right away.

2302
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
There were other people that filled that niche for you.

2303
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
You are on the fence.

2304
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:29,000
And I think the company would rather have you at least kind of tilt over

2305
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
and get the game eventually a little cheaper than not pay anything for it at all.

2306
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Dan Shadow in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

2307
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
By the way, X-Com is addicting.

2308
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:42,000
And TigerClaw says, The new X-Com is awesome.

2309
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Probably not helping you being able to resist buying it right now.

2310
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I know I'm really curious.

2311
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I kind of want to see if one of my friends has it

2312
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
and go over to their house and watch them play

2313
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
and then see if I want to get it.

2314
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
We'll see.

2315
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
There's a G100 mat in our chat at live.vognetwork.com

2316
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
that warns it's hard from what I've been seeing.

2317
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
There you go.

2318
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Any more emails tonight?

2319
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
No.

2320
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Then let's get to the FUs of the week.

2321
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Because damn, y'all angry.

2322
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:29,000
FU to Origin slash EA and or BioWare if BioWare is involved in this

2323
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,000
for the patch that just came out for Mass Effect 3

2324
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,000
that's not letting me and other people connect to the game

2325
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
to actually play it and also not verifying my DLC

2326
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:42,000
so I can't play the game that I paid money for.

2327
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Sue.

2328
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Oh, no.

2329
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,000
I've already put the three magic words on EA's help forum.

2330
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Better Business Bureau.

2331
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I've gotten two responses already from other people in the community

2332
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,000
so maybe it'll green light it, you know.

2333
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Heavy to my cold.

2334
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I'm all stuffed up.

2335
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,000
What'd you get when you have a toddler in preschool?

2336
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Well, I don't have a toddler in preschool or whatever

2337
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
but I do have a boyfriend and he's sick

2338
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
so FU to the fact that he's sick.

2339
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Don't get me sick, anybody.

2340
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
He can't help it but I'm just saying, you know,

2341
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I feel like dead man walking right now.

2342
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Like, I'm surrounded by, I know I'm gonna get sick.

2343
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I guess I'll have to try and enjoy the time off work

2344
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
while I'm sitting here on the couch with the fever.

2345
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Yeah, lucky for you, you can take time off of work.

2346
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
If I take time off of work, I probably have to watch Josh.

2347
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
That's not really time off of work.

2348
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Well, and oh, here's the other perk.

2349
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Because, you know, I have a cold, I'm obviously snoring

2350
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
because I have to breathe through my mouth and stuff

2351
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,000
so I have to sleep on the couch.

2352
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I've been sleeping on the couch for the last two weeks.

2353
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
And that means I also have to tend to the baby all night long

2354
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
when he loses his bink and cries.

2355
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
So I'm up about once every hour.

2356
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Don't worry, in a few more years, he'll be able to take care of himself.

2357
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
It's all good. Well, he can take care of himself now.

2358
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
He's just too tired to find his bink that's right next to his head.

2359
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
And he's like, I want my bink, it's under my head.

2360
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I'm like, why don't you get it yourself?

2361
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Tigerclaw in our chat room is reporting that the Mass Effect 3 data pad

2362
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
hasn't been working for weeks.

2363
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Mine's worked.

2364
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Really?

2365
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I'm at 100% right now.

2366
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Well, then there you go.

2367
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
It's just you, Tigerclaw.

2368
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Uninstall, reinstall.

2369
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,000
That's actually what I did is I uninstalled, reinstalled Mass Effect 3

2370
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
and tried to play it.

2371
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,000
And what happened is that it gave me the same error before

2372
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:42,000
so I went on offline mode and it let me go into the single player game

2373
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,000
and then I later on was able to get into multiplayer,

2374
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:50,000
but it since hasn't allowed me to do any of it again.

2375
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, I've been playing XCOM on my Twitch TV recently.

2376
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
That's one of those things I'm surprised I'm not into right now

2377
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,000
is streaming video games.

2378
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
I think I'd have fun.

2379
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Wouldn't you guys like to see me play Mass Effect 3 online?

2380
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

2381
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Yeah, Tigerclaw saying the galaxy at war won't load.

2382
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Oh.

2383
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Yeah, it's actually...

2384
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
It was saying that it wasn't for me to still let me play everything,

2385
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
but now it's actually saying cannot log into servers or whatever.

2386
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Yeah, I'm...

2387
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
If you can hear it, I'm actually in the thing right now.

2388
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
There you go.

2389
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
All right, let's move on.

2390
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
A couple more news stories for you guys and then a Skype line and Twitter topic.

2391
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
All right.

2392
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
So, let's talk about Minecraft.

2393
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Minecraft's got a pretty awesome update coming out next week.

2394
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
1.4.

2395
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
That's a pretty scary update.

2396
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
And, of course, it's sort of Halloween themed.

2397
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,000
They did one a couple years ago that was also Halloween themed.

2398
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:53,000
And they're adding a lot of cool shit into the game.

2399
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:57,000
So, first, let's talk a little bit about what they're adding.

2400
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:00,000
One of the things I'm very excited about is command blocks.

2401
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:06,000
And what the command blocks allow you to do is actually issue some of the commands

2402
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
from the admin panel in game.

2403
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:15,000
So, you can have a block set up, for example, to have a certain area set to peaceful.

2404
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,000
So, no mob spawn in a certain radius or something like that.

2405
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Or you can have a command block that's set up to spawn a person to a certain coordinate,

2406
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
which I'll be using for sure.

2407
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Or a command block to set the weather or to do all sorts of different things.

2408
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
You can actually have mobs spawn.

2409
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I think they actually have it where you can create mob spawners now too.

2410
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
They're updating all the different sounds in the game.

2411
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,000
They're adding sounds for placing different blocks, for walking on those blocks,

2412
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:51,000
sounds for the enemies, all sorts of cool stuff like that.

2413
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Portals are changing a little bit.

2414
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
The Nether portals in creative mode, you're going to be able to instantly go through them.

2415
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Adventure mode, they're allowing you to break blocks now.

2416
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
And you can also place blocks.

2417
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
They're changing how they're doing the breeding stuff.

2418
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:12,000
They're adding different characters into the game, including bats, witches, and...

2419
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:21,000
What was it? It was the wither and wither skeletons.

2420
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Also, they're having some changes to iron golems and stuff.

2421
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Now they're going to attack other characters.

2422
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Creepers, once again, you can actually create them with mob spawners

2423
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
that you can now put down in the game.

2424
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
And you can toggle how long it takes for them to explode and their explosion radius,

2425
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,000
which is pretty cool.

2426
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:45,000
And then new blocks, they've got, besides those command blocks, beacons,

2427
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
which will create that Luxor pyramid beam into the sky thing,

2428
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
as it can give you different buffs.

2429
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Anvils to repair armor and tools.

2430
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
The mob spawners, as I mentioned.

2431
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Flower pots, so you can put saplings and mushrooms and whatever in little pots.

2432
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Cobblestone walls, wooden logs are going to change how you can place those.

2433
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Stairs are going to go around corners now, which is kind of cool.

2434
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Item frames, so you can make little frames of your maps and clocks and stuff like that.

2435
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Heads, you can put a human head in the wall.

2436
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,000
They're also making some changes to trapdoors.

2437
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,000
They're adding wooden buttons that you can activate with arrows.

2438
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
And potatoes, carrots, carrots on a stick for riding pigs.

2439
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
You can ride pigs and control where they go now.

2440
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Awesome.

2441
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
So we're going to have, I'm going to set up a pig cart racing track.

2442
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
That'll be pretty awesome.

2443
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
God.

2444
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Different potions, including night vision and invisibility potions.

2445
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Maps, now you can spawn them, or you can craft them so they zoom out

2446
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
and create larger maps.

2447
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,000
And leather armor can be dyed, so you can wear pink armor if you want to.

2448
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:58,000
And of course the new villain or boss character in the game, the wither,

2449
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:03,000
can be spawned too, although I'm kind of scared to spawn that

2450
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:08,000
because you can actually create it with soul sand and wither skeleton skulls,

2451
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
but he will attack mobs and players.

2452
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,000
And he's got explosive heads that will actually blow up everything, including obsidian.

2453
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Oh boy.

2454
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
So, I'll have to make a rule.

2455
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
No spawning the wither.

2456
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I just sort of blanked out and had no idea what he was talking about.

2457
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
It's like when you talk about Mass Effect.

2458
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
You know what I'm talking about.

2459
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I at least hear you.

2460
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Well, bats are going to be cool.

2461
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I mean, those will...

2462
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
It sounds interesting.

2463
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I've been slacking on a Minecraft thing, I have.

2464
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
There's only so many hours in the day, people.

2465
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Remember folks, you can come to the Minecraft server.

2466
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:45,000
We got, I'm usually on with one or two people.

2467
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Usually it's just me, for hours at a time.

2468
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I made a giant fucking roller coaster the other day.

2469
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Nice.

2470
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
It's really big.

2471
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I want to ride it.

2472
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
It's got lots of jumps on it.

2473
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Alright.

2474
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
And, yeah.

2475
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Very cool.

2476
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Alright, well, one more story for you guys tonight,

2477
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
and this is a bit of a sad thing.

2478
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:06,000
We did lose somebody in the gaming industry this week,

2479
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:10,000
and it was a UK-based individual, Mike Singleton,

2480
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
who unfortunately passed away this week at the age of 61.

2481
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:14,000
He died of natural causes,

2482
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,000
and this was after a year-long battle with jaw cancer.

2483
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
You may not know the name,

2484
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
but you might know some of his contributions,

2485
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
including Space Ace on the Commodore VIC-20.

2486
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:26,000
I don't think that's to be confused with the arcade title.

2487
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,000
War and Middle Earth for the ZX Spectrum.

2488
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Midwinter and Midwinter 2 for the Atari ST, Amiga, and PC.

2489
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
One of the most recent things he was involved with.

2490
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Grid for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

2491
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:41,000
So Mike Singleton, again, passed away at 61.

2492
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Please, a tip of the glass here.

2493
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:47,000
A toast to absent friends.

2494
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Alright, let's get to Twitter.

2495
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2496
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
And the Skype line is now open.

2497
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2498
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2499
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:02,000
If you want to give us a call, again, the Skype line's open.

2500
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2501
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2502
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
I need to go grab the iPad.

2503
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2504
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Just some small stuff.

2505
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:20,000
They were talking about having a change to the Xbox Live, I guess, service.

2506
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:25,000
They're going to do Xbox Live migration to anyone, I guess.

2507
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
And it's going to be automated soon.

2508
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:34,000
And what migration means is that if, for example, I'm in North America and I move to Europe,

2509
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:41,000
you can change your account so that it will show the European marketplace.

2510
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Which would be completely useless if you brought your system.

2511
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:48,000
But for whatever reason, if you want to change regions or something like that, then you can do that.

2512
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
But they're going to allow you to do that.

2513
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Let me quickly go to the phones because we do have a call.

2514
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2515
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
It's Shane.

2516
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Shane. What's up, Shane?

2517
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
There are two things I would like to talk about tonight.

2518
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Number one.

2519
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Silent Hill Book of Memories is a piece of garbage.

2520
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You probably would have used another word, but I know you don't swear.

2521
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Well, it's also a piece of crap or a piece of...

2522
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Well, I've already used two words, so it's fine.

2523
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Why is it so terrible? You're like the biggest Silent Hill fan I know.

2524
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Not lately because they've all been crap games.

2525
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:26,000
In fact, this weekend I watched Downpour because I haven't played it yet and that was pretty crap too.

2526
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:33,000
My boyfriend picked up the main game and I forced him to return it because I've heard bad things.

2527
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:41,000
So then I downloaded the demo, which is not always indicative of the quality of the game, but from what I understand, the demo is really close.

2528
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:48,000
And it ruins everything that I like about Silent Hill.

2529
02:31:48,000 --> 02:32:01,000
It's a dungeon crawler with breakable weapons, mixed up characters, and it's got a store for goodness sakes that you visit to buy things.

2530
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Get your Diablo out of my Silent Hill.

2531
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Yeah, and I hate Diablo, so it makes it worse.

2532
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:16,000
But the thing that got me right away was in the tutorial, besides making your character, which I usually love, because making characters I can spend hours on,

2533
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:24,000
you enter the Silent Hill world. The very first monster you see is Valtiel and he gives you missions.

2534
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
His first mission? Visit the store.

2535
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
That's not something Valtiel would ask me to do.

2536
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
For one thing, he doesn't have a mouth. He'd just be shaking his head at me.

2537
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,000
And secondly, I'd probably be dead.

2538
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Wow.

2539
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Yeah, it is a negative 1200.

2540
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Silent Hill has jumped the shark.

2541
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Yes, and I expected better from this company because they did the ports of Contra.

2542
02:32:51,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Well, not ports, but they did Contra 4 and A Boy and His Blob, the remake. So, I don't know, very disappointed.

2543
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Let's see, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, quote, I hate Silent Hill. It's not Mass Effect. Shane, back of the box.

2544
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:13,000
No, that is not true. I like other things that are not Mass Effect, just not as much.

2545
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,000
All right, what's the number two thing you want to talk about tonight?

2546
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Um, crap, what was it? Oh, Mass Effect.

2547
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Of course, of course.

2548
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I am greatly disheartened at the fact that they have confirmed no Shepard for the next game.

2549
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:36,000
And they also are saying that it's not going to be like another Shepard type character.

2550
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Which leads me to think that it may not even be the same style of gameplay, which I'm very, very, very worried about.

2551
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
It should be the saga of Garrus.

2552
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
It's going to be a dancing game.

2553
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I'm very pissed off at them, Shane.

2554
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I hope it's the Volus dancing game.

2555
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
It's going to be Space Channel 5.

2556
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
It's going to be Volus bowling.

2557
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Okay, look, here's the deal. It's because it's probably a next gen game.

2558
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:07,000
The Mass Effect 4 is going to be on the new consoles, and so that's why I think they're putting the past behind, and they're going to go this different direction.

2559
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I don't think that means you're going to get this drastically different gameplay.

2560
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:15,000
It's just, you know, whatever the niche is about these new consoles, Mass Effect's probably worked it in somehow.

2561
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I'm just worried that it'll be like an RTS or something that I hate, or a sports game, or a strategy game.

2562
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:29,000
I think it's just going to be very similar, but, you know, it might handle a little differently, it might play a little differently.

2563
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Just don't expect the same interface and all that stuff you see in the first one.

2564
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
I think it'll be alright. Give it a chance.

2565
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I'll give it a chance.

2566
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Bioware made Mass Effect 1 after all, and 2, and 3.

2567
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Shane, yell at them for me.

2568
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Yell at who?

2569
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Anyone who's involved with my Mass Effect not connecting.

2570
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
I don't know who to yell at for that.

2571
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
She's been trying to play. Funny enough, I know somebody she could yell at.

2572
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
There you go. Rob is your answer.

2573
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:02,000
But, um, yeah. You might know this person, actually.

2574
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Really?

2575
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:06,000
I'll tell you off air. I better not. Can't tell you here.

2576
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
But, um, yeah.

2577
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
I need my Garris fix.

2578
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Jamie's not able to play multiplayer with us, instead. I played some multiplayer.

2579
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
I can't even play single player.

2580
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
We have more achievement points than Alan. How does that work?

2581
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Or, not achievement points, but challenge points, whatever that new thing is.

2582
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I do not know.

2583
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
BlackWolf is trolling in our chat room saying,

2584
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:31,000
A Mass Effect with the writing team of Borderlands and Portal. Want.

2585
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:36,000
So, not as good as previous Mass Effect games?

2586
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:40,000
No, that just means that they'll throw in a lot of dirty humor.

2587
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I don't want that. I like the seriousness.

2588
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Technus Reality Check says,

2589
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Unfortunately, BioWare has to finish Dragon Age 3 first.

2590
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Yeah, no one cares.

2591
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:58,000
You know, I care. I like Dragon Age. I didn't like 2, but I'm actually thinking about giving it another shot on some system that I own it on.

2592
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:03,000
I don't know which one I'm going to play it on, but I got excited for the information that leaked out.

2593
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Or, not leaked out, but that came out about Mass Effect Dragon Age 3.

2594
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
But there's no Garris.

2595
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
There's no what?

2596
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Garris.

2597
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:15,000
I'm not all about Garris like you, so there's no Kayden for me.

2598
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
There's no Kayden.

2599
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,000
That's true.

2600
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
There are the little weepy emo elf boys.

2601
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I played one of those in the first game.

2602
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:26,000
He was awesome. He wasn't sad.

2603
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Alright, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Shane?

2604
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
No. Not at all.

2605
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Well, apparently you broke our stream anyway, so thanks for that.

2606
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Good. I'm proud of that.

2607
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Alright, then I'm hanging up on you. Bye.

2608
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Alright. 1877 Game OLR.

2609
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Who am I talking to right now?

2610
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Nobody, because the stream's not connected apparently.

2611
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Alright.

2612
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Well, it did just reconnect, so hopefully some people will hear this and know that the Skype line is open again.

2613
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
1877 Game OLR.

2614
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Did I say that right? 1877 Game OLR.

2615
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2616
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Did we ever figure out if it was the host thing because obviously our internet here is not having issues?

2617
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Yeah, it's not our internet here.

2618
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
It is either...

2619
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Well, I don't even think it's our connection getting to the server because wouldn't that mean our IRC should go down?

2620
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Our internet would stop working.

2621
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:20,000
You'd get booted from Mass Effect or whatever you're doing in there.

2622
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Like, all that should happen too, right?

2623
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:28,000
That individual connection from, sorry, 3 to 2 to the thing in New Jersey.

2624
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Hmm. Maybe. I don't know. Alright.

2625
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
I blame New Jersey.

2626
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Alright.

2627
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
The entire state.

2628
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Let's try to go...

2629
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:42,000
I think maybe other things don't get disrupted by little internet hiccups.

2630
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,000
But the feed will just shut down if that happens.

2631
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
I don't know. Anyhow.

2632
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Let's move on. 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2633
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Loki, did you have any last minute stories for us?

2634
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Because I got some tweets I can do here.

2635
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
No, I don't have any.

2636
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Let me go to a tweet from ActDeft that says,

2637
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Oh, the Wii U's first commercial from Europe.

2638
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I didn't know the Wii U.

2639
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
That's actually the commercial. Don't worry.

2640
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:15,000
At last, a brand new console with a brand new controller that redefines how you interact with games.

2641
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
So what is Wii U?

2642
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Shoot at the TV like never before.

2643
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Sping, sping, sping, sping, sping, sping!

2644
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Nice shooting.

2645
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:26,000
And say someone wants to watch TV when you're halfway through a game.

2646
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
I want to watch the TV now.

2647
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Do both and everyone's happy.

2648
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:38,000
See a different perspective with the gamepad and get closer to your target for a more precise shot.

2649
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Nice.

2650
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Is this a real commercial?

2651
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:45,000
It's a real commercial. It's in Europe, but I wanted to point out something that I read.

2652
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Do notice when they say play games that you've never seen before or something like that,

2653
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
and they show Batman Arkham City.

2654
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,000
The Skype line is ringing off the hook, so I need to get one of these calls.

2655
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Hi, you're on Orange Islands Radio. Who's this?

2656
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Hi, can you guys hear me?

2657
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Ooh, you're very, very quiet. Turn it up a little bit.

2658
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:06,000
I'll try. It's just stupid skies being a pain.

2659
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Yeah, we can barely hear you. The listeners probably can't hear you either.

2660
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
How about now?

2661
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Nope, you're still quiet.

2662
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
We have one more go.

2663
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Crank it up.

2664
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,000
May I have to shout it in this case?

2665
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
We can hear you a little bit. Go ahead. What's up? Who is this?

2666
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
First up, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2667
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Hey, DDR Dollar Bill. What's on your mind?

2668
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Hey, not much. You guys mentioned earlier about you gave a shout-out to those who participated in the Extra Life marathon.

2669
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Yes.

2670
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Yeah, I took part in that too for the first time.

2671
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Congratulations. How'd you do?

2672
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:47,000
I lasted for quite a while, but I dozed off at around six-something.

2673
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
That's all right.

2674
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Yeah, but it taught me something very interesting.

2675
02:39:53,000 --> 02:40:04,000
First off, me and my coworker at work actually managed to raise a decent amount of money in two days because we just got the okay from our job to take part in this.

2676
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Nice.

2677
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:16,000
And second off, it is so hard to do 24 hours of gaming on some games because some games just bored the hell out of me after an hour.

2678
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:25,000
How did you do it? Did you try to do one game for the whole 24 hours, or were you like, okay, every hour we're going to switch? How did you do that?

2679
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I switched it up about every one hour or two hours, depending on the game and how I was feeling when playing it.

2680
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I got you. So what kind of stuff did you play?

2681
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Let's see. I haven't re-bought a new game in a while because I'm waiting on a new computer to ship in, so it was mostly stuff that I had to catch up with in my queue, which is quite a lot, but quite old.

2682
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:04,000
I was catching up in Arkham Asylum, for example, then there was Red Dead Redemption, things like ModNation Racers, and even Infamous.

2683
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:11,000
And then I went to the 360 where I caught up with some Rock Band 3 and things like Virtua Fighter 5.

2684
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
So a lot of modern stuff, but that's good.

2685
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:24,000
And were you live streaming this all to Ustream or Twitch or whatever one of those sites, or were you just kind of doing this at home and trying to get people to sponsor you doing that at home?

2686
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Mostly through Facebook, and I just stayed at home. I didn't really do any streaming or tweeting because, like I said, it was my first time, so I wasn't exactly sure what to do.

2687
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Sure. Hey, you know what? And even raising $1 is a great effort for the cause, so congrats to you.

2688
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Let me ask you, though, how did you go about raising the money? Did you just spam a lot on Facebook, or what was your strategy to get people to care?

2689
02:41:50,000 --> 02:42:00,000
I just posted. I had two days to get the money, so I just said, alright, I'm just going to post on Facebook, and whoever gives, whoever gives, you know, wasn't going to be picky.

2690
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I'm just like, hey, just whatever you can spare. I don't care if it's $1 or $2 or $12, just whatever you can spare.

2691
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
And some of my coworkers gave money.

2692
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Nice. Well, assuming you're doing it all again next year, what are some things you're going to do differently?

2693
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Get the okay about a month in advance, and then start doing a fundraising there and asking everybody I can think of, and I also would like to see you guys participate as well.

2694
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:35,000
You know, it's kind of hard when one of us has a baby, you know, to do the 24-hour straight, but we definitely want to get involved in the charity effort.

2695
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:42,000
I mean, you know, last year, Dark Soccer and I both did a lot with UmLoud, and we're going to do whatever we can to help this year as well.

2696
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:55,000
That's something that we're really passionate about. We do want to try to do our own thing outside of the holidays, just because the holiday is a very crowded time for charity, but, you know, charity needs TLC 24 or 7, 365.

2697
02:42:55,000 --> 02:43:04,000
So we do want to do something at some point. We think especially with the VOG Network behind us, you know, get Bobby and Critical Myth and some of the other shows in on it.

2698
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:17,000
Try to do some type of, and maybe not necessarily just games, we have to really think about this, but some type of nerding out for charity, and we've got to really put the borders on that, but I think there's an idea in there somewhere.

2699
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Ah, I see. That's a good idea, actually. Hell, I don't think anybody would say no to geeking out for charity.

2700
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Exactly. We just have to figure out exactly how to do it, so we'll see what we can do.

2701
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:39,000
I just have one more quick question. What is it about World of Warcraft that keeps you guys playing? I just want to know that.

2702
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Pandas.

2703
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:50,000
The other people that play, and just, you know, having the community, and I'm not necessarily just talking strangers, but like friends or people that have become my friends through the game.

2704
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Just, you know, being able to log in and say, hey, it's a chat room with fireballs and swords.

2705
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I like that.

2706
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:00,000
That's exactly it. Alright, well take care, buddy. Have a good one.

2707
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
You too, thanks.

2708
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Thanks for the call, and thanks for doing Extra Life. That's great.

2709
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Hey, any time.

2710
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Alright, take care.

2711
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Yeah, we do need to get in on more stuff like that. We do. But, you know, there's a lot of charity events. We can't do them all, but we'll plug wherever we can, absolutely.

2712
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:24,000
1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. I'm falling way behind on some of these Twitter stories, so let me get to some other ones of these here.

2713
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Tigerclaw sends a few over here. One saying, UK man faces jail time for selling counterfeit Nintendo games. Oh, I'd read about this previously.

2714
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:41,000
A 41-year-old Justin Success Brooks. Well, not living up to his middle name right now.

2715
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Apparently, he did fraudulent sale of counterfeit Nintendo games. This is all allegedly.

2716
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:55,000
According to the Cryodin Guardian, he was caught in an investigation conducted by Nintendo and then the UK Interactive Entertainment Association.

2717
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:05,000
He trafficked illegal Nintendo goods from 2009 and 2011. He made almost a million dollars in U.S. dollars. It was about 600,000 pounds.

2718
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Selling counterfeit Wii DS and DSi games. He was charged with seven counts of fraud, two counts of fraudulent trading, two counts of supplying an article to use in a fraud,

2719
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:21,000
two counts of unauthorized possession of goods bearing a trademark, and one count of unauthorized use of the trademark is what that all boils down to.

2720
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:30,000
He did plead guilty to all counts. He's awaiting sentencing. Boy, oh boy. Alright, let's do one more call.

2721
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2722
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Hey, this is Raginator.

2723
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Hey, what's up, Raginator? Haven't heard from you in a while.

2724
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Yeah, I know. It's kind of a long story. I kind of posted on what's been going on on the blog forums, so I won't rehash that.

2725
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Fair enough. Well, what's up? What's on your mind?

2726
02:45:49,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Well, I, God forbid, I actually got my first PC game, you know, last weekend. It's kind of an older title, but definitely good one. I think you guys would approve the Apple II.

2727
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:11,000
That is a classic. That is a classic. And in fact, you should just keep playing that one and pretend it's three, because then you'll be more satisfied.

2728
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Oh, I'm trolling. I'm trolling. Making the Diablo III fans mad.

2729
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Honestly, you know, truth be told, you know, I've seen that I don't have access to a PlayStation 3 for the time being. I need something to play.

2730
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:32,000
I was sure that Diablo II would run out of my machine, so they have the store. I can't figure what the heck to pick it up.

2731
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:40,000
So, you're playing the classics right now. What made you choose Diablo II out of all the games you could have picked out there?

2732
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Well, I wanted to get a game legally as opposed to some kind of torrent. Some torrents were out. And some of the edutainment titles they would give for kids definitely don't appeal to me.

2733
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:09,000
And I'm pretty sure that even though my new computer is a little bit more high-tech than my old computer that was stolen, you know, games like Grand Theft Auto and whatnot probably won't run on my computer.

2734
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:15,000
So, I can't figure. Alright, Diablo II is what? Ten years old?

2735
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:19,000
It might even be older than that, actually. But yeah, it's old. Very old.

2736
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Yeah, and plus, you know, I played Diablo I, or at least a PlayStation 1 port of Diablo I on my, you know, PlayStation 1 way back when. I knew I liked the PlayStation 1 port of the original game, so I can't figure.

2737
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Eh, might as well go with it. Plus, it was $20 for the base gaming and the one expansion pack, so.

2738
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Okay, so some of our chatters are asking about this, so I have to ask you about it because I keep hearing it too. Do you have a smoke alarm dying in the background?

2739
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Uh, basically, yes. I need to, you know, put the new battery in.

2740
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Don't set fire to your house with it because when it's crying out for a low battery, just be careful. Oh my god, how do you sleep with that going?

2741
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Uh, well, I learned to tune it out, actually, so.

2742
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Honestly, get up, take that thing down, take the battery out. Not that I should be encouraging you to do that, but get a good night's sleep, for god's sake. Take the battery out of that sucker and make it a priority in the next couple days to replace that before your place burns down, which I hope it doesn't, but you always want to be prepared.

2743
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Yeah, well, and I don't do, you know, I don't engage in any kind of dangerous activities in my place, but I never know with my neighbors.

2744
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:40,000
That's right, your neighbors might be smoking marijuana and you don't even know. Alright, look, the thing I really wanted to tell you about was, you should check out this website.

2745
02:48:40,000 --> 02:49:00,000
If you're interested in getting games legally, especially old stuff that will play on your computer and, you know, safe, I would look into a website called GOG.com, and that's G-O-G.com, it's Good Old Games, and they sell tons of old stuff, and a lot of it goes for like five bucks, seven bucks, and there's some really good stuff in there.

2746
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:21,000
In fact, they're trying to cash in on the indie bundle craze right now, not that it's really an indie bundle per se, but they have like an interplay bundle going on right now, where for like 35 bucks you can get like 50 games, and there's some classics in there, like Descent, and Castles, which is a game I used to play. It's a great website, and I have to recommend it.

2747
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Another game that I probably should probably get back into is World of Warcraft, if only because I did download the clients on my computer and tried to play it, although the framing was extremely choppy.

2748
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Well, you can say goodbye to your life if you get back into World of Warcraft. No, but well, the graphics have come a long way.

2749
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:51,000
It's a higher, more powerful game, and I think it will be a little bit better.

2750
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Sure, that's good. Have a good one.

2751
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:22,000
I guess I had to end the call, but let's all hope that Raginear gets the battery replaced in Smoke Detector soon.

2752
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Alright, moving on. I need to do the rest of these Twitter topics, because there's still like a bunch of these here.

2753
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:37,000
So I did the one about Tigerclaw on the counterfeit time. Let me read one other tweet from Tigerclaw. He sent a couple others. Usually I do a two tweet max, but these are both pretty good.

2754
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:49,000
This is about the Zynga lawsuit that was settled. Zynga sued the makers of Pyramidville because they used the word Ville.

2755
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Cobo Joe was the name of the company. They actually settled, and Pyramidville is now Pyramid Valley, so I can't believe it. They caved.

2756
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Oh well. Poor guys.

2757
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Alright, here's the other one from Tigerclaw that I think is definitely worth reporting on here. Apparently there's a Steam vulnerability that can lead to a remote insertion of malicious code.

2758
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Now don't panic, for God's sake, but you know when Steam gets a hole poked in and a lot of people are going to be talking about it.

2759
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:19,000
So apparently there's a vulnerability in the Steam browser.

2760
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Does Steam come out when you poke a hole in it?

2761
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:32,000
But it's the Steam browser protocol. When you use, instead of like HTTP to go to a website, you use Steam colon slash slash to go to a website.

2762
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:46,000
If you can get a user to click on a link for a specially formed Steam URL, an attacker can remotely exploit buffer overflow bugs and other vulnerabilities in Steam games and Steam itself to get malicious code on a target's machine.

2763
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:55,000
So please be careful what you click on, but knowing Valve, this shit is probably already patched. We're going to be on it very soon.

2764
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
So, there you go.

2765
02:51:57,000 --> 02:52:05,000
Also, Dark Tetsuya wants to remind you guys, and I'm so sorry I forgot. I think this is really cute, these little fan games and so forth that are made.

2766
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Dark Tetsuya finished his President Cat Pong, which he made in the games factory, and sure enough it's a little President Cat.

2767
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:18,000
You know we love President Cat that bounces back and forth on these barber poles? Whatever, it works out.

2768
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
So, very cute. Love it.

2769
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:26,000
It is available for download. The only place you're going to find it is on the forums at vognetwork.com slash forums.

2770
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Check the Orange Lounge Radio Forum for the President Cat Pong download. Good job, Dark Tetsuya.

2771
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:41,000
ActDeft tweets about Forza Horizon's Rally Expansion and StreetPass? Oh, SeasonPass, excuse me.

2772
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Forza Horizon, of course, is launching on October 23rd. Apparently, what's happening with this, for 1600 Microsoft points, you can get the Forza Horizon Rally Expansion pack.

2773
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:05,000
It is included with the SeasonPass, however, and I guess you get an off-road racing experience with deeper ruts, higher jumps, and new surface types to explore.

2774
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:12,000
It's an add-on pack for Forza. What else do you need to know? Look at them shiny cars. Look at them shiny, pretty cars.

2775
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:16,000
I am terrible at Forza, just for the record.

2776
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:24,000
SDG100Matt sent that same link about Skyrim at Rice University. Bummer, we already talked about that. Fushuda!

2777
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:30,000
That's it for Twitter Topics. How about, um, Loki, did you have anything else you wanted to throw out there?

2778
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,000
No. I have nothing.

2779
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Ooh, this is a big one. Bobby's linking this in chat right now.

2780
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:52,000
From the official PlayStation blog, a new system software update for PlayStation 3, 4.3, will make changes to how trophies are displayed on your PlayStation 3.

2781
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,000
It's now on the PlayStation Network on the cross-media bar. Alright.

2782
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Let's see. Also, by the beginning of November 2012, we will retire the services available through the Life with PlayStation application.

2783
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:11,000
We will stop offering the Life with PlayStation application to new users with the 4.3 update.

2784
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:17,000
This includes the conclusion of our participation with Stanford University's Folding at Home.

2785
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Over 15 million users participated in the program. They've donated more than 100 million computation hours to the Folding at Home project.

2786
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Um, considering the contribution PS3 has made to the project, we decided to retire it as a result of discussions with Stanford University.

2787
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:41,000
So at least it wasn't like they just yanked the plug, but I guess it was a mutual decision. That's kind of interesting.

2788
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Did they find the cure of what they were looking for? I hope so.

2789
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Huh.

2790
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Well, at least it was a mutual decision, but I hope it wasn't one of those mutual decisions meaning Sony went to Stanford saying,

2791
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:55,000
this is what we're going to do. Tell us how you're going to deal with it.

2792
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:58,000
I don't know. It seems like it was a good thing.

2793
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Beg for us to change your mind.

2794
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Right?

2795
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
No? Fine.

2796
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
So. All right.

2797
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,000
So that's all I've got. So you don't have any more last minute stories?

2798
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:13,000
I don't have any more last minute stories. I think that means we're at the end of the show.

2799
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Windows 8's out this week, right? Excited?

2800
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
Yay.

2801
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Tigerclaw wants to remind us she can still do Folding at Home on the PC.

2802
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:27,000
All right. Um, let's wrap up the show. We're done. We're out of here. Good night.

2803
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Remember, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2804
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Word of mouth, it's all we got.

2805
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:38,000
We really appreciate the enthusiasm in the fan community through these fan games and all that other stuff.

2806
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Also, of course, you know, kind words on iTunes reviews, Stitcher promotions, things like that.

2807
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:49,000
You know, other iOS devices. What other apps are there? TuneIn. I can't even think of them all.

2808
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
There's so many. And Android, too.

2809
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Alan has one I've never even heard of that he uses to listen to podcasts, and it's pretty good.

2810
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:00,000
So, wherever you heard about Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word. We appreciate it.

2811
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:03,000
And, of course, support all the shows on VOG Network.

2812
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:06,000
vognetwork.com. We've got a ton of great shows on the network.

2813
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:13,000
All week long talking about various geek things, not just gaming shows, but TV shows and movies.

2814
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Well, no dedicated movie shows yet, but some of them talk about movies.

2815
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Things about British TV culture, anime shows, Warcraft shows. It's all there, vognetwork.com.

2816
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2817
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Loki, we'll start with you tonight. Your final thought.

2818
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Well, Lisa, if you're going to use Windows 8, there's Start 8 by Stardock.

2819
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:38,000
That'll actually put the Start menu back, so it's not so broken.

2820
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Okay.

2821
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2822
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I'm still pissed that I can't play Mass Effect. Still so pissed.

2823
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:49,000
As you should be.

2824
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
And I miss my kitty.

2825
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I'm sorry. All right.

2826
02:56:55,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Well, my final thought is I'm hungry and I can't wait for dinner.

2827
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:04,000
And it's really too bad that I haven't eaten dinner yet, because you know what even sounds better than dinner?

2828
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,000
It's Pinkberry. Nah, nah, nah. Maybe later this week.

2829
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Pinkberry for dinner.

2830
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Pinkberry for dinner. Someday.

2831
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Also, and I have one more final thought.

2832
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:15,000
RuPaul's All Stars Drag Race starts tomorrow, just so you know.

2833
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Just so you know. You can watch the...

2834
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Judging you.

2835
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Here's the disappointing thing. You can watch the first episode online right up to the elimination.

2836
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:25,000
It's okay. It wasn't as good as it should be.

2837
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:28,000
I hate the twist. I hate the twist.

2838
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Reality TV twists are stupid.

2839
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:35,000
All right, that's it. If I haven't scared you off already, thanks for tuning into the show and downloading and listening to us.

2840
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:36,000
We really appreciate it.

2841
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Have a wonderful week. We'll be back to doodle again next time.

2842
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Good night.

2843
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:44,000
