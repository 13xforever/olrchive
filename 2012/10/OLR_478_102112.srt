1
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, October 21st, 2012, Xbox will soon unfriend two of their social applications.

2
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:26,247
[SPEAKER_08]: More Sega games are being re-released as download titles, and a PC game ships without the necessary activation keys.

3
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:32,018
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

4
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you've been out for two weeks.

5
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:00,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You went from really good stuff to really not so good stuff.

6
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Disneyland, let's focus on Disneyland.

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,020
[SPEAKER_05]: How was Disneyland?

8
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,560
[SPEAKER_15]: It was gay.

9
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you had a happy time.

10
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:16,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we didn't actually go into the park on Saturday because our good friend and listener got into a little bit of an accident.

11
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's okay, right?

12
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:18,445
[SPEAKER_05]: He's okay.

13
00:01:18,465 --> 00:01:21,006
[SPEAKER_05]: When you first told me that, I was like, oh my god, but he's fine, right?

14
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,507
[SPEAKER_15]: The car came out a little...

15
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a car is a poppy.

16
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Things we learn in our lives.

17
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:27,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Cars are just cars.

18
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:28,513
[SPEAKER_05]: People are people.

19
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:29,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

20
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:32,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan and I had a fantastic time regardless.

21
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:36,763
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I came home, now I'm going to get into the horrible part.

22
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:37,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

23
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,345
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,564
[SPEAKER_15]: and she even curled over with an ear poking out.

25
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:07,545
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got pictures on Facebook.

26
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:10,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll repost them in the chat.

27
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:14,249
[SPEAKER_15]: She finally started doing better and started eating again.

28
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:22,535
[SPEAKER_15]: So I put her back in her room and made sure her towel was in there with her and I let her come into the computer room whenever she wanted.

29
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:42,840
[SPEAKER_15]: and um Tuesday like around midnight or so she um well actually yeah it would be Tuesday she was uh half in the laundry room and half out in the hall and she batted my foot and so I stopped and petted her and you know we had a good cuddle and she purred she was a little wheezy when she purred

30
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,582
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, oh, it's old lady kitty, you know.

31
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:53,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Around 2 o'clock, I was actually about to go to bed, and I went to look for the cat to pet her goodnight, because I always pet Shermie goodnight.

32
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:58,370
[SPEAKER_15]: And she was in the living room, dead, just laying on her side.

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,932
[SPEAKER_15]: And I couldn't tell if she was breathing, because she was so fat.

34
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:06,275
[SPEAKER_15]: And I went in, and she was still warm, and so I couldn't really tell.

35
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:12,420
[SPEAKER_15]: But the moment, there's like a muscle tone that you can feel the difference, and yeah.

36
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:21,889
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, Shermie, I'd have to say she probably died around 1.30 in the morning based on her temperature and everything.

37
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,634
[SPEAKER_15]: And the fact that, you know, she had rigor mortis doesn't set in for like a few hours anyway.

38
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:29,016
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, yeah, Shermie died.

39
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:30,317
[SPEAKER_15]: She was...

40
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:43,213
[SPEAKER_15]: 15, actually we redid the math and she was probably 16 because I got her when she was a year and a half old so which would have put her birthday in October so she was 16.

41
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:08,259
[SPEAKER_05]: In case the newer listeners don't know, because we've been taping where we're at now for about a year almost now, probably a year and a half.

43
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,001
[SPEAKER_05]: But we used to tape the show at your house.

44
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:12,823
[SPEAKER_05]: We've actually taped the show at like five different places in the 10-year history.

45
00:04:13,103 --> 00:04:14,224
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did tape the show at your house.

46
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:17,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, obviously, you had Shermie.

47
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:22,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shermie was pretty notorious on the show for sleeping at my feet and so forth.

48
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Her bed was under the table.

49
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And you would sometimes put the mic down near her and say, what do you think about that, Shermie?

50
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And she would actually go, meow.

51
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:50,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here he goes Exactly So, yes, this does affect the show in many ways And of course, there was a very infamous moment that happened at one point on the show That I want to bring up a clip of here And I really want to thank Dark Tetsuya for finding this clip for me But this is a clip from, I think he said it was episode number 357?

52
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:56,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah This is old, this is old, here it is Well, what's that, Jamie?

53
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I was talking about Shermie.

54
00:04:58,897 --> 00:04:58,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

55
00:04:59,157 --> 00:05:00,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Shermie just crapped.

56
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did she?

57
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:02,430
[SPEAKER_15]: That was her review of the show.

58
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:04,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

59
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,698
[SPEAKER_05]: That was us talking about the tester.

60
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And Shermie notoriously took a poo on the floor and gave her review of the show.

61
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Her secondary poop spot was... I've told people this before.

62
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Shermie had arthritis in her hips.

63
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:28,106
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when she could manage to pee in her box, she just couldn't poop properly in her box because she couldn't actually physically get in her box.

64
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:32,968
[SPEAKER_15]: So sometimes she would just wait until people were around and take a poop in the hall.

65
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, I have shat!

66
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:36,917
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:16,128
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Dan let me sleep in the next day and he went to have her cremated.

68
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:23,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Because actually in Citrus Heights, if a pet is under 15 pounds, then you can just throw them in the dump and he's like...

69
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:24,473
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

70
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a lot of love for you in our chat room as well.

71
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Live.VogNetwork.com Critical Myth, R.I.P.

72
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie, Orange Ride, R.I.P.

73
00:06:53,237 --> 00:07:01,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie, Actdeft, You Shall Be Missed, DDR Dollar Bill, Still Want to Say Sorry About Shermie, City Vampire, I'm Sorry, Dark Sakura, Dark Tetsuya, R.I.P.

74
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:06,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Shermie, Black Wolf, Shermie had amazing parents.

75
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:08,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of love from the listeners as well.

76
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:10,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I know it's hard.

77
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:11,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

78
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Most cats aren't so lucky.

79
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:48,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd say what was funny too is that I was actually, because you know, basically the reason I wasn't here Sunday is because I had cramps so debilitating I could not walk.

80
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:56,632
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was literally, I felt like someone had put my girl bits in a vice and, you know, was trying to get orange juice from them.

81
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:57,733
[SPEAKER_05]: La la la la la.

82
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:58,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

83
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:22,906
[SPEAKER_15]: but I had ended up just sitting down on the floor you know because I couldn't move and it was the most comfortable spot and Shermie padded right over and she liked to sit in between my legs for some weird reason and put her head on my thigh which I've got pictures of her doing it and sticking out her tongue and being cute and she just sat in my lap like that for like an hour and we just hung out and

84
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:27,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, not to be morbid, but maybe she knew.

85
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:29,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they know.

86
00:08:30,526 --> 00:08:35,230
[SPEAKER_15]: When a cat knows that he or she is going to go, they stop eating.

87
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,552
[SPEAKER_15]: They go to the same spot over again.

88
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:39,973
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was getting that feeling with Shermie.

89
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:45,257
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why the first time I picked her up and brought her in the computer room with me, and she was like, oh, okay, I'm fine.

90
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:52,199
[SPEAKER_15]: But, it's funny, she wouldn't eat her regular cat food, but she'd still eat the treats from my fingers.

91
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:00,802
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a video of that too on Facebook of her eating treats and making the kitty wants nom face.

92
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,082
[SPEAKER_15]: So, my baby.

93
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:06,763
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to get another cat.

94
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:07,679
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

95
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:34,388
[SPEAKER_15]: It's also, you know, and I hate to put it in terms like this, but are you going to, you know, immediately replace your cousin if they die?

96
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,469
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go to the store and buy a new cousin.

97
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:40,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Or if one of your friends, you know, she's a member of my family.

98
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,371
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe it's, you know, some people are just like, oh, it's just a cat.

99
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,411
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get another cat.

100
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:49,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, but they have their own personalities.

101
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,732
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had her for 14 years.

102
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:52,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

103
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:53,473
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a teenager.

104
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:53,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

105
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, she's a whole lady, really.

106
00:09:56,655 --> 00:10:00,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, 14 years ago was PlayStation 1, right?

107
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:00,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

108
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:01,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about that era.

109
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Dreamcast, that's when Dreamcast were coming into your house.

110
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Shermie used to sniff at the VMUs, I remember that.

111
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:14,567
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, she's a good cat.

112
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:21,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes, it is a video game show, you guys, but sometimes, you know... She's named after a video game, so shut up.

113
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:22,032
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

114
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:23,293
[SPEAKER_05]: She is named after a video game.

115
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is Shermie, for those that may not know?

116
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:33,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, um... Shermie was one of the characters in the King of Fighters series, the one with the dancer type with the hair in front of her eyes.

117
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,063
[SPEAKER_15]: But when we got Shermie, the adoption paper said Sherman.

118
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,685
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I'm not naming my cat Sherman.

119
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:42,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Nina Little didn't know she would become the size of a Sherman tank.

120
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:43,729
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um...

121
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:50,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and I wasn't necessarily going to name her after Sherman from, you know, Mr. Peabody.

122
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:53,609
[SPEAKER_15]: So she'd go back in the Wayback Machine.

123
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,212
[SPEAKER_15]: But she, we were like, well, we need a good name for her.

124
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:01,134
[SPEAKER_15]: And so Shermie popped up and it seemed to fit her.

125
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,996
[SPEAKER_15]: She was graceful at one time.

126
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:06,437
[SPEAKER_15]: At one time.

127
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,520
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go AFK a minute.

128
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,140
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine.

129
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,842
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, go say hi to the chatters.

130
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:15,003
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot of very kind things to say.

131
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:15,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've been reading it.

132
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:16,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we'll help.

133
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:18,705
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for sharing the story.

134
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if you do a show for 478 episodes, we're on at 478, you know, the listeners start to get to know you.

135
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,232
[SPEAKER_05]: We start to get to know them.

136
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:30,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to share these big moments that happen.

137
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,714
[SPEAKER_15]: We always liked you guys.

138
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And we like Shermie.

139
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,138
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Shermie.

140
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:36,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, come on.

141
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,544
[SPEAKER_15]: She was... I remember when she actually... Because she would sit on my feet sometimes.

142
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:43,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And I remember when she actually got out of her box and sat on your foot.

143
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:44,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of her bed.

144
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:44,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

145
00:11:45,619 --> 00:12:13,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Duke Nukem in our chat room puts it very well video game podcast or not life isn't all about video games sometimes stuff like that happens and intervenes for the games and we all understand no I know you guys understand I'm saying that mostly for the benefit of the new people who might be hearing OLR for the first time because you know every week somebody's gonna hear it for the first time like what is this show I just downloaded all they talk about is dead animals ah but it's it's much more than that guys hopefully that story kind of tells you the family that we've built up here over the years so sure sure is my baby

146
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:14,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

147
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:22,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially, and just to share a little personal thing, I mean, Dan and I have been trying for a couple years to conceive.

148
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, mostly I've been doing the work.

149
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:28,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Because... All right, we'll leave it at that, yes.

150
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:29,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know what you mean.

151
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate when people go, we're pregnant, when really the wife is pregnant.

152
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:35,884
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not carrying that baby, dude.

153
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:36,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

154
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but he has to put up with you.

155
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right?

156
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:41,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I right?

157
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:41,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

158
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:52,395
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um, but I mean, Shermie was pretty much, you know, if without that cat, I think I would have been a big wreck.

159
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:55,718
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and now I'm like, I don't want any kids.

160
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:56,599
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want more cats.

161
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,365
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm clearly not going to get another cat, at least until after we move from the house, which will be after December.

162
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:23,215
[SPEAKER_15]: and I'm gonna be a rescue just to give a little plug here the animal outreach out here in California they're actually in Placer County they are a no-kill shelter that's where I took Donut or Batcat or Bruce whatever people want to call him there's a little kitten I rescued from the dumpster outside my synagogue

163
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:25,876
[SPEAKER_15]: They are a no-kill shelter.

164
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:30,258
[SPEAKER_15]: They get animals fixed shots and take them to PetSmart to have them adopted out.

165
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:36,241
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would say anyone in the Northern California area, give them your support.

166
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:39,942
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're going to get a cat or a dog, go through animal outreach.

167
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,183
[SPEAKER_15]: They're really good people.

168
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:46,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf in our chat room says, For those of us without kids, our pets are our kids.

169
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:51,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I put up just as many pictures on Facebook of my babies as my friends do of their babies.

170
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a really good point.

171
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,139
[SPEAKER_15]: When I come back, I'll spam chat with pictures of Shermie.

172
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:57,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds great.

173
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,139
[SPEAKER_05]: We need an OLR pet community of some sort.

174
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I'll make a... Why don't we have a Tumblr?

175
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:04,960
[SPEAKER_05]: A pet Tumblr.

176
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,640
[SPEAKER_05]: A pet Tumblr?

177
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,941
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR pet Tumblr.

178
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:10,641
[SPEAKER_05]: You work out all them specifics and we'll work that.

179
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,342
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll name this episode Cat Shit.

180
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:15,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragenator says we should dedicate this episode to the memory of Shermie.

181
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:16,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

182
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Cat Poop.

183
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:18,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Cat Poop?

184
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:18,603
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

185
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:19,543
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll name it Cat Poop.

186
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:20,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's probably take it.

187
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,424
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

188
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft in our chatroom says Petsagram.

189
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,351
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a good point to that.

190
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:56,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Without deviating too much, I finally did the sheep thing and I got an iPhone 5 over the weekend.

191
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:58,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's husband sold it to me.

192
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:00,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

193
00:15:00,874 --> 00:15:02,575
[SPEAKER_05]: My 4, the button was broken.

194
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,195
[SPEAKER_05]: The camera was broken.

195
00:15:04,335 --> 00:15:06,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't had a camera on my phone for like a year.

196
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the first thing I did with my iPhone 5?

197
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:09,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Take cat pictures.

198
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:10,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Redownloaded Instagram.

199
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:13,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Took a picture of Maruko in the kitty bed and put, I'm back.

200
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So you decided to purchase another phone from a company whose phone broke in a couple years.

201
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:20,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

202
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:21,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

203
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, admittedly, I didn't use a case or anything protective with it, and that's a long story.

204
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:28,784
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's kind of my own fault.

205
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:29,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Get an OtterBox.

206
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:34,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, Alan bought one for me.

207
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, because OtterBox is seriously... I'm on my second OtterBox.

208
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:40,696
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not because the last one broke.

209
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:47,343
[SPEAKER_15]: It was because actually the rubber surrounding it broke and not the thing itself.

210
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:51,227
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's skip into video games a little bit.

211
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:53,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we get to our gaming weeks, we usually have a kickoff topic.

212
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we've already been talking a little bit, but let's have a game-related kickoff topic.

213
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:02,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I'm going to put you on the spot because you put up this very cryptic tweet over the last week.

214
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, I perked up because it had the word Disney in it.

215
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:11,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, I don't know if now is the time you can tell me to F off, but what is this tweet all about?

216
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,008
[SPEAKER_05]: You said Disney Universe?

217
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:23,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney Infinity is a new property from Disney that's coming out next year in the spring or summer.

218
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:29,369
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to start tying in with all their movies that they come out with animated and stuff, including re-releases.

219
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:30,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Wreck-It Ralph?

220
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:32,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, no.

221
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, like I said, next year.

222
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:35,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So next year.

223
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:39,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, because they're going to release, isn't Little Mermaid on deck to be re-released in 3D and all that?

224
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:41,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's the next one.

225
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's Cars, actually.

226
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

227
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:44,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

228
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's the next Pixar movie to be done in 3D or something.

229
00:16:49,259 --> 00:17:02,512
[SPEAKER_04]: But, basically, because I don't know too much about it yet, and there's a lot of speculation to what it is, and I mean, I know a little bit, but it's basically their version of Skylanders.

230
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:07,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's a game of some sort, I assume some sort of adventure game, although I don't really know what it is.

231
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:09,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

232
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,359
[SPEAKER_04]: They're starting off with some weird stuff.

233
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:32,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think it's like Mickey Mouse and all that stuff.

234
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe those are in the starter kits or something like that, but it's basically the Cars characters.

235
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:43,584
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also Pirates of the Caribbean characters.

236
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:46,225
[SPEAKER_04]: What else was there?

237
00:17:46,745 --> 00:17:52,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Later on in the fall, they're going to be doing stuff for Frozen, which is their new animated movie.

238
00:17:52,627 --> 00:17:53,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

239
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:54,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their big movie for next year.

240
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Wreck-It-Ralph

241
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:20,469
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Tangle was two years ago at this point, because technically it came out Christmas of the year before.

242
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, last year was Winnie the Pooh, and this year is Wreck-It Ralph, and next year is this Frozen.

243
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:30,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Frozen, and they've had some other stuff.

244
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:39,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the characters I did see that they mentioned, Jack Skellington, Mickey from the whole Sorcerer's Apprentice stuff.

245
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:40,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasia?

246
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they said Sorcerer Mickey or something like that.

247
00:18:45,202 --> 00:18:52,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as much as I might want to sit here and roll my eyes, it does make a heck of a lot of sense for Disney to cash in on that.

248
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:56,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously, you put the nail on the head.

249
00:18:56,924 --> 00:18:59,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Spyro and Skylanders, say what you will about the game and so forth.

250
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:00,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes them a buttload of money.

251
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:03,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes them an assload of money when you don't even know these characters.

252
00:19:04,005 --> 00:19:05,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody has any attachment to these characters.

253
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,626
[SPEAKER_05]: These characters were made up for this game.

254
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:11,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Spyro being the one lone distant exception.

255
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:11,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even...

256
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And put Spyro side by side with Mickey Mouse or Jack Skellington or any of the characters you mentioned.

257
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:24,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And the power of the people.

258
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,342
[SPEAKER_04]: You think people are...

259
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:30,025
[SPEAKER_04]: are consumer whores over Skylanders characters.

260
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:35,406
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not even understand how many consumer whores there are for anything Disney.

261
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:37,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney did have that game.

262
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:38,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that was the one that was called Disney Universe.

263
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: They did have that game last year.

264
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:43,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It was okay.

265
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:52,110
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't going to win any Best Game of the Year awards or anything, but for a family game, pick up, go, it served its purpose.

266
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:52,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fine.

267
00:19:53,030 --> 00:20:04,613
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I could totally see that type of engine in that game taken on this, you know, because that game was set, it had a very LittleBigPlanet-esque element to it where you could kind of dress the characters up and so forth.

268
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:11,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it wasn't as detailed as LittleBigPlanet, but like, you know, TigerClaw in chat saying, no Tron characters, well, Disney Universe.

269
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:12,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not yet.

270
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:16,597
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only, they only have, you know, the first and second wave stuff announced so far.

271
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:16,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

272
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:18,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney Universe did have the Tron character.

273
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, LittleBigPlanet actually had Tron characters too.

274
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,921
[SPEAKER_04]: They still could do that stuff.

275
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,843
[SPEAKER_04]: If they think about it, they probably have a Tron movie in the works.

276
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:29,786
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they have another Tron movie probably in a couple years.

277
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:33,309
[SPEAKER_04]: If not an animated movie or something to cash in on that.

278
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:37,912
[SPEAKER_04]: That animated series is pretty awesome, which I guess it restarted recently and I have to go catch up on it.

279
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they renew it for another season?

280
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:39,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

281
00:20:40,254 --> 00:20:45,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's a new season or if it's the second half, like the fall season or something like that, but yeah, it's still going.

282
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:45,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark

283
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:49,582
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you said when you were at Disneyland you saw a lot of the Skylanders stuff, right?

284
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:50,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw like a few things.

285
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:53,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was interesting because, you know, it's weird.

286
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:54,829
[SPEAKER_15]: But it might have been downtown Disney.

287
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:56,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

288
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,874
[SPEAKER_05]: You do see a little more bleed over in downtown Disney.

289
00:20:58,894 --> 00:20:59,395
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.

290
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's interesting.

291
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:05,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll be cool.

292
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,341
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, though, I really hate dealing with Skylanders.

293
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:11,906
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just more of a... It's gonna be all these pieces.

294
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:12,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an internal thing.

295
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:17,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that the toy industry does not line up well with the way things are done in the game industry.

296
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:19,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately...

297
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:36,973
[SPEAKER_04]: hundreds of SKUs hundreds well it's not that everything's assorted so unfortunately our system the way it's set up there's no way to set up hey you're going to get random stuff in this box so you have to sell it by the case quantities that come in thankfully the case is 6 or 12 for the characters but

298
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:42,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a receiving nightmare because the way they do it is that case has a UPC on it.

299
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:45,126
[SPEAKER_04]: That UPC you have to use for each individual character that you order.

300
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I order 12 of this UPC, we get in one box with that UPC.

301
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like we're getting one twelfth of what we order.

302
00:21:52,439 --> 00:21:53,841
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

303
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Suddenly Kingdom Hearts is being recognized by Disney again.

304
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:14,923
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very exciting.

305
00:22:15,183 --> 00:22:20,487
[SPEAKER_15]: They thought that it was like a Jedi one, but when you pull up on the receipt, it says Kingdom Hearts Mickey.

306
00:22:20,788 --> 00:22:21,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

307
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:24,170
[SPEAKER_15]: There's two other pins that I saw online, but they weren't in the park.

308
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:30,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome if they did like a LucasArts, Kingdom Hearts type crossover, like have one of the worlds be Star Wars world or something like that.

309
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:31,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get your hopes up.

310
00:22:32,557 --> 00:22:33,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go crazy now.

311
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:36,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Muppets world would happen before Star Wars, because Muppets is Disney now.

312
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, yeah.

313
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:41,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe Pixar's next movie is the Monsters, Inc.

314
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:41,223
[SPEAKER_05]: prequel.

315
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:07,979
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

316
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:44,373
[SPEAKER_15]: I played some Espegaluda, which I'm actually now in my head thinking of it as ESP Eagle.

317
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:45,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Espegaluda?

318
00:23:46,496 --> 00:23:48,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Garuda would be Eagle.

319
00:23:48,838 --> 00:23:50,320
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm thinking it's Psychic Eagle.

320
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,382
[SPEAKER_15]: So Espegaluda.

321
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:53,744
[SPEAKER_15]: And...

322
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:57,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I played, of course, WoW.

323
00:23:58,351 --> 00:23:59,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking Pandas.

324
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that what the expansion's called?

325
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:02,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking Pandas.

326
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:02,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking Pandas.

327
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,926
[SPEAKER_15]: And I finally did Heroics, by the way, which were pretty fun.

328
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:09,070
[SPEAKER_15]: I did this new Sholomance, by the way.

329
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:28,759
[SPEAKER_15]: it's actually really well done I liked it played Mass Effect 3 I would play more Mass Effect 3 if it wasn't that the stupid EA servers won't connect I'm going to try Alan's suggestion and try to connect to my Mass Effect 2 but I never had this problem until the patch

330
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:32,946
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's clearly something having to do with the patch.

331
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,869
[SPEAKER_15]: In my estimate.

332
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:40,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I've bought DLC that I can't use because I can't get into single player.

333
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:45,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it won't let me play for my saved game.

334
00:24:45,837 --> 00:24:46,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Low origin.

335
00:24:46,838 --> 00:24:48,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Low, low origin.

336
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:50,461
[SPEAKER_15]: More like fuck origin, you know?

337
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:54,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Um... And, uh... I...

338
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, not much of anything else.

339
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:04,151
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, I'll sit and play something, but I really have tried not to be at my house too much this past week, so.

340
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:05,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Understandable.

341
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:08,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Any playthroughs of stuff that you've watched, Dan?

342
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:09,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you and Dan like to watch these playthroughs.

343
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:11,613
[SPEAKER_15]: He's obsessed with Borderlands 2.

344
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,134
[SPEAKER_15]: I cannot get... He's beaten it again.

345
00:25:13,434 --> 00:25:13,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

346
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:16,455
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, oh, it wasn't much harder this time, and...

347
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:21,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of playthroughs, I should give this a shout out.

348
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:22,235
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an important shout out.

349
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:25,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But shout out to everybody who participated with Extra Life this weekend.

350
00:25:25,377 --> 00:25:29,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean, there were tons of playthroughs all over the internet for a great cause this weekend.

351
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think most of those marathon fests and so forth are probably winding down around now.

352
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:37,445
[SPEAKER_05]: But props to all you guys who participated with that.

353
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:38,526
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great cause.

354
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:40,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want us to do something like that at some point.

355
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:42,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Even our buddy Breslow.

356
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:43,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

357
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:45,950
[SPEAKER_05]: You raised $3,300?

358
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

359
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,210
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a bad chunk of change.

360
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you, buddy.

361
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:49,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

362
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:50,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

363
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:52,512
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, Loki, how was your gaming week?

364
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I'd played more, but I didn't.

365
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I played, let's see, lots of Minecraft.

366
00:26:00,234 --> 00:26:10,997
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked on a giant roller coaster the entire week, and I pretty much finished it, although HitStone was working on some stuff, so I don't know if they go check to see if it's still working again.

367
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:15,018
[SPEAKER_04]: and then also a giant marquee with Chasing Lights.

368
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:16,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I had those on there.

369
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

370
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Also play Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

371
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I managed to pull off Streak Week.

372
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:32,424
[SPEAKER_04]: That means I did not lose one single lunch game that I played against my coworkers in Call of Duty to their dismay, unfortunately.

373
00:26:32,785 --> 00:26:33,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm rubbing it in.

374
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:41,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to go for Streak Month, however, I can't play on Monday because I have to go look for costume stuff for Halloween.

375
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,291
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing for Halloween?

376
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:51,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see if we're going to be too lazy about it or not, but we're going to do costumes for the Yip Yips from Sesame Street.

377
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:51,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha!

378
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

379
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,183
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

380
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:32,218
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

381
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:54,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, so it's that and then some like styrofoam balls for the eyes and pipe cleaners.

382
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:55,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so it's really easy.

383
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:03,369
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of doing the impression, I guess, would be... Just saying, if you ever get hard up for ideas, the chatters would love to see the tingle thing happen.

384
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:07,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not going to happen just because, once again, I mean, this is...

385
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:10,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, here's what we've got, okay?

386
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:13,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the three costume backup plan ideas that we have.

387
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:16,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily something that... Obviously, it's not going to be something that we do this year.

388
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,121
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Italian Spider-Man, because that's going to be hilarious.

389
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:24,024
[SPEAKER_04]: How is Italian Spider-Man different from Spider-Man?

390
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:26,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you not seen Italian Spider-Man?

391
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant Cardboard Robot You're not one to say no to a challenge.

392
00:28:50,948 --> 00:28:55,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really want to buy painter's stilts, so probably not going to do that one.

393
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

394
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:03,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be funny to do the yippee-yips if we can pull it off.

395
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So we may do that.

396
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:06,723
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

397
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm not entirely broke right now, but I could be doing other things right now.

398
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:14,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

399
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the chat room is trying.

400
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,047
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying.

401
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:26,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Wolf in our chat room says, Let's say, just as a hypothetical, if I paid for Loki's airfare, accommodations, and Dragon Con badge, would he cosplay as Tingle at Dragon Con?

402
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:29,134
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

403
00:29:29,154 --> 00:29:30,715
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would if you paid for all of that.

404
00:29:30,775 --> 00:29:30,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

405
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:31,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I would.

406
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:34,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You fail to understand, though, that I can't travel, remember?

407
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:36,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

408
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:36,538
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

409
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:38,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So that doesn't work.

410
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's... There's no one of the difference about having the baby and having the kitty.

411
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:46,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody can come watch the kitty and you can leave them on their own for so long.

412
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:49,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can do that with the kid later on, but not right now.

413
00:29:50,474 --> 00:29:51,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, that's true.

414
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:52,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

415
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:54,198
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Delorean

416
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,317
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of fun.

417
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:25,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also I did play a little bit of the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

418
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:29,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I just played one ranked match and did the tutorial.

419
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:30,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

420
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is similar to the Smash Brothers.

421
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:38,058
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem with that game, I mean, playing with four people that I don't know, it's very chaotic.

422
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:38,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

423
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know any of the characters' moves or anything.

424
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:48,405
[SPEAKER_04]: The tutorial doesn't really... It just basically tells you, okay, this button's a hit, this button's to throw people.

425
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:49,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Go.

426
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And you kind of have to figure it all out.

427
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,428
[SPEAKER_05]: How long is that thing going for?

428
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I have yet to jump on board.

429
00:30:54,108 --> 00:30:54,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten more days.

430
00:30:55,129 --> 00:30:56,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I've still got some time.

431
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you've got time on that.

432
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe during break I'll go set the PS3 up to download that.

433
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not on... Well, yeah, PlayStation Plus, I guess.

434
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:03,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can do that.

435
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:04,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have PS Plus.

436
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:09,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, it's cross-play, so you can play against people that have the PS3 version and stuff.

437
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:12,836
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did I do?

438
00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:16,518
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty much it.

439
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:19,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked a little bit more on the whole DDR stuff.

440
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep thinking about it, and I'm...

441
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:33,714
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

442
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:34,615
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

443
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to be quick because I know we're running long tonight.

444
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:39,857
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's some new things I want to talk about.

445
00:31:40,037 --> 00:31:41,398
[SPEAKER_05]: First, let me get the old out of the way.

446
00:31:41,538 --> 00:31:44,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing more World of Warcraft, Mr. Pandaria.

447
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,061
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I overall do...

448
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:50,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And while overall I do love fucking pandas

449
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:13,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Good lord.

450
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,690
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week.

451
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:19,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I played Mists of Pandaria or whatever you want to call it.

452
00:32:19,514 --> 00:32:20,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing.

453
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:24,058
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I love the expansion, dailies are going to drive me fucking insane.

454
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:24,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a bitch.

455
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done with dailies.

456
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:30,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to get the best gear in the game, you've got to do the dailies.

457
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:31,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm so over it.

458
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:32,587
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I want to say.

459
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:34,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Mass Effect 3.

460
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:41,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite DarkSakura's issues, I'm actually able to play even though it will take me like five minutes to connect.

461
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:44,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, it will connect on PC.

462
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:46,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to play more on Xbox 360.

463
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:46,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do.

464
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:51,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe the days are here where it's easier to do it on Xbox Live than it is the PC, but believe it.

465
00:32:54,771 --> 00:33:02,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been really enjoying this expansion content and even though the collectors are such assholes, like every time they show up as the enemy, you're like,

466
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:03,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, why?

467
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:05,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god.

468
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Praetorians are such dicks.

469
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, he's possessed.

470
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:37,931
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, Mass Effect 3 is great So let's talk about new stuff One game that I know y'all probably saw the review on Vognetwork.com of And if you haven't seen it yet, you should go Like, go check out Vognetwork Because not only am I reviewing games But we've got reviews up of TV shows and comic books And audio dramas Everything geek you can think of It's there at Vognetwork.com And there's plenty more coming throughout next week And so forth So make it a habit to check every day, okay?

471
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:40,593
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

472
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:08,030
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, when you boot the game, it's do you want to go to the main menu or do you want to just start the party?

473
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I'm talking party mode, I'm talking pretty good mix of multiplayer things.

474
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:16,013
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the two people dancing at the same time that you're used to.

475
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:24,016
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole dance battle tournament style thing where, you know, the crew battle where you can set it up with like eight people, I think, can all do this.

476
00:34:24,556 --> 00:34:24,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just...

477
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Jump in, jump out, high five, play.

478
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:30,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really smart the way they did it.

479
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's going to get even better.

480
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:44,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unfortunate I couldn't see the game's full, full potential right now because Smart Glass, it's supposed to be one of the first games that's going to support the Smart Glass where while people are dancing on the couch, maybe you're not the type that wants to get up and dance.

481
00:34:44,689 --> 00:34:48,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can sit there on the couch and control what songs are coming up next through Smart Glass.

482
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:50,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's a pretty neat use of it.

483
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:50,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's...

484
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:54,436
[SPEAKER_05]: using the technology wisely without whoring it.

485
00:34:54,456 --> 00:34:56,157
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's a smart way to do it.

486
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:03,724
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's a lot of good stuff in Dance Central 3, especially when it comes to multiplayer.

487
00:35:03,784 --> 00:35:04,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the mimic.

488
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:07,608
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do a dance move and then your partner has to mimic it too.

489
00:35:07,628 --> 00:35:08,129
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

490
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:09,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Solo stuff.

491
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to the solo stuff, it's kind of what you know already.

492
00:35:14,575 --> 00:35:16,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's only so much one person can do.

493
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:20,481
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there is a comprehensive new story mode in the game.

494
00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:23,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was a little silly.

495
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people will enjoy its over-the-topness mode.

496
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:29,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a little bit like, alright, why am I playing this mode again?

497
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:33,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'd rather would just like choose the songs I want to do and dance to it.

498
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:36,639
[SPEAKER_05]: And to give the game credit, I can do that.

499
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just go into the dance mode to do it.

500
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:41,565
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did kind of sit there going, oh, it's kind of a

501
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:44,946
[SPEAKER_05]: This mode is actually put together really nicely.

502
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:46,847
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of a shame it's so silly.

503
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:56,109
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I liked the concept that you were traveling through the decades because it really gave it a comprehensive song list.

504
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:03,552
[SPEAKER_05]: But to give you an idea how silly it was, you find yourself in Dance Central Intelligence...

505
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:09,837
[SPEAKER_05]: DCI, and they send you back in time to find the dance moves of the evil guy.

506
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:10,878
[SPEAKER_05]: It's silly.

507
00:36:11,258 --> 00:36:16,863
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a good excuse to put things like YMCA and some of the 70s classics are there.

508
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually thought the 70s... Did we get The Hustle?

509
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:20,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, The Hustle is in the game.

510
00:36:20,366 --> 00:36:21,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, I have to play it.

511
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:22,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what song is in the game?

512
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:23,529
[SPEAKER_05]: You will lose your shit.

513
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:23,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Car Wash?

514
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:24,930
[SPEAKER_05]: To represent the 80s.

515
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:25,550
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

516
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:27,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the music play...

517
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:28,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Ice Ice Baby

518
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:45,634
[SPEAKER_15]: You know he's 45 now.

519
00:36:45,774 --> 00:36:46,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh God.

520
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:47,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanilla Ice is 45.

521
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Hangin' Tough or one of the new Kids on the Block songs is in there.

522
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: This is silly, silly shit.

523
00:36:52,641 --> 00:37:00,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so as much as you can look at that and laugh and whatever, when you get into the modern stuff, I was not a big, big fan of the modern stuff they picked.

524
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,474
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but they, here's the problem.

525
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:08,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2 had such good song lists when it came to contemporary stuff.

526
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,936
[SPEAKER_05]: There was really slim pickings for three.

527
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:17,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some of the newer, like they have moves like Jagger and the J-Lo song and, you know, some of them are represented.

528
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,521
[SPEAKER_05]: But it didn't feel as modern club as Dance Central 1 and Dance Central 2.

529
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:26,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But the good news, of course, if you own the prior games, you import the song list for 400 Microsoft points.

530
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:31,424
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to pay it again for number one if you already imported one into two, which is great.

531
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:33,964
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

532
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Overall, I ended up giving the game a B-plus on VOG Network.

533
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:47,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The strengths, of course, were the party mode, the instant stuff, the fact that I felt like there were more things to do in Part 3 from Part 2 than there were from Part 1 to Part 2.

534
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:49,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

535
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:50,247
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

536
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:51,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there a gay dancing mode?

537
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:54,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny you should bring that up.

538
00:37:54,388 --> 00:37:59,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you play Dance Central 2, a lot of the dances are very, shall we say, feminine?

539
00:37:59,709 --> 00:37:59,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

540
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Central 3, I wasn't feeling that.

541
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe a big part of that has to do with the song list.

542
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:06,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there was one song.

543
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:07,173
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

544
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:13,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

545
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:19,283
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that song?

546
00:38:19,704 --> 00:38:24,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do these little moves called seduce and things where you're basically smacking your ass and all this stuff.

547
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:27,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That was still a little bit gay dancing.

548
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,951
[SPEAKER_05]: But I liked it a little bit.

549
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:29,652
Yeah.

550
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, nothing is more hilarious.

551
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:32,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

552
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:33,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care who you are.

553
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:36,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have some real talk right now about Dance Central.

554
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:50,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is more hilarious than when you get to that freestyle section of the song where it takes 16 pictures of you or whatever really fast to run up to the camera and start booty popping and then turn around just in time to see your butt back on the screen.

555
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:50,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.

556
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:52,294
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you've all tried it.

557
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:53,574
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have not.

558
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:54,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you need to try it.

559
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:55,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun.

560
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:59,918
[SPEAKER_15]: I still think, though, that nothing is as wonderful as watching you play the ABBA.

561
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:06,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that's the sad thing, is that the 70s, unfortunately, did not have ABBA to represent them.

562
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:11,406
[SPEAKER_05]: But I always thought Sony had the lock on ABBA because of SingStar, but then Ubisoft had that You Can Dance game.

563
00:39:11,426 --> 00:39:13,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know, I guess I'm not going to hold my breath.

564
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to hold my breath for Dance Central to get the rights to it.

565
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:16,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.

566
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all right.

567
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

568
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:23,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, yes, but can I bend and snap?

569
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:24,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do whatever you want in freestyle mode.

570
00:39:27,216 --> 00:39:29,900
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf in our chatroom says, I've never tried that.

571
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:32,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also never fucked pandas like Rob has.

572
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:34,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, shut up.

573
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,033
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what else new can I talk about?

574
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:41,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I went into GameStop this week.

575
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there and I had this impulse.

576
00:39:47,983 --> 00:39:53,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to have LittleBigPlanet on the PlayStation Vita right now.

577
00:39:53,507 --> 00:39:54,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't going to wait for Amazon.

578
00:39:54,648 --> 00:39:55,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go get it right now.

579
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:56,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that.

580
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,291
[SPEAKER_04]: So why didn't you just buy it digitally?

581
00:39:58,551 --> 00:39:58,971
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

582
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:07,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't like... That worked out for me getting Mass Effect 3 because I was impatient and actually got him to go down to the Amazon price.

583
00:40:07,077 --> 00:40:07,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

584
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:10,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up buying it.

585
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:17,562
[SPEAKER_05]: But not only did I go into GameStop to buy that game, but they had a Wii U demo unit up and running.

586
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:18,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that.

587
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:22,944
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these things are starting to show up at your Best Buys and GameStops and where have you.

588
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,525
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to get your hands on the Wii U, you can do that.

589
00:40:26,186 --> 00:40:26,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised.

590
00:40:26,686 --> 00:40:27,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say this much.

591
00:40:27,546 --> 00:40:54,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get into the whole Wii U debate thing again because we're already running long but I will say this much I was surprised those tablets were a lot bigger than I was giving it credit for because in my mind I'm thinking oh that thing is kind of like the bottom part of a 3DS or whatever so I was thinking it was going to be like I didn't think it would be that small but I didn't think it would be that big either so I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the Wii U pad otherwise there wasn't a lot on the demo unit to really get a feel for the system the only thing you could play was the Rayman's

592
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:56,534
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I going to say?

593
00:40:56,574 --> 00:40:57,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So was the controller comfortable?

594
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:57,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

595
00:41:21,201 --> 00:41:22,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was fine.

596
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:28,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't really hold it for very long because Alan did the playing of the demo, but I thought it was fine.

597
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:31,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like bigger than a PlayStation Vita.

598
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you do have to kind of get used to it.

599
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:36,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like holding this small little laptop in your hands.

600
00:41:36,644 --> 00:41:37,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost bigger than this.

601
00:41:38,485 --> 00:41:41,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It's slightly bigger than this, and I'm pointing at this laptop.

602
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:42,165
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dell Mini 10.

603
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:43,866
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura's using what?

604
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:44,706
[SPEAKER_05]: The Dell Mini 10.

605
00:41:45,186 --> 00:41:45,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

606
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:47,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

607
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:49,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I apparently just got an answer from EA about my...

608
00:41:51,498 --> 00:41:53,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid Mass Effect thing, so I'm going to check it.

609
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:55,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to try playing Mass Effect right now during the show?

610
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:56,973
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I can't play on the netbook.

611
00:41:56,993 --> 00:41:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say.

612
00:41:57,793 --> 00:41:59,714
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll make that thing implode if you try to do that.

613
00:41:59,814 --> 00:42:00,875
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

614
00:42:01,015 --> 00:42:01,855
[SPEAKER_15]: It won't make it implode.

615
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:03,897
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll just melt into a puddle of for fuck's sake.

616
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:08,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Nate4322 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, would you buy it?

617
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about getting one.

618
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably going to get one because I'm a consumer whore.

619
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't pre-order one, though.

620
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:15,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And how?

621
00:42:15,323 --> 00:42:22,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So unless I can get the hookup, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, through friends, I may be shit out of luck.

622
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:23,668
[SPEAKER_15]: You can do what I did.

623
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:24,188
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

624
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:25,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait in line outside Target.

625
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:26,631
[SPEAKER_15]: All night.

626
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:28,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, Target didn't do pre-orders.

627
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:29,855
[SPEAKER_15]: We bribed our way into the line.

628
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:30,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

629
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:38,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that, well, if Rayman Legends is your type of game, you're not getting it at launch.

630
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,641
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out in March now.

631
00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:43,583
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

632
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:54,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, that's Launch Window because, you know, Launch Window is like this, you know, if Nintendo has windows that large, I mean, shit, I'm surprised they haven't gotten broken into.

633
00:42:54,714 --> 00:42:55,375
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, you.

634
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:57,277
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not debating the Wii U tonight.

635
00:42:58,337 --> 00:43:00,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I will talk about, though, LittleBigPlanet Vita briefly.

636
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:05,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been able to spend a whole lot of time with it, but I will say I'm pleasantly surprised with it so far.

637
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It really does feel like I'm playing LittleBigPlanet 2 on the go.

638
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:12,823
[SPEAKER_05]: The game looks really nice, and the new touch mechanic, pretty cool.

639
00:43:13,203 --> 00:43:14,964
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

640
00:43:41,591 --> 00:43:42,191
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

641
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:23,369
[SPEAKER_05]: but the one other thing I'll say about it that I actually liked compared to LittleBigPlanet 2 is that it did not default to let's go online and play with strangers yay like no it defaults to play by yourself and if you want to do that you can but you don't like it's not being shoved down your throat to do that so I'm I was very happy about that that already has me liking it almost a little more than LittleBigPlanet 2 although I do love LittleBigPlanet 2

642
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:24,777
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

643
00:44:25,597 --> 00:44:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get into gaming news already, but first, some quick housekeeping.

644
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:38,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter.com slash OLR and, of course, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to be our friend on various social networks.

645
00:44:39,464 --> 00:44:40,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really it.

646
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:43,625
[SPEAKER_05]: The award nomination stuff is all over now.

647
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:47,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just waiting to hear if enough of you nominated, and we'll find out.

648
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:49,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Stitcher's stuff goes up tomorrow, so we'll see.

649
00:44:50,328 --> 00:44:51,389
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll let you know on the next show.

650
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:52,830
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

651
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:29,655
[SPEAKER_04]: and, um, also, I guess they, uh, had already laid off 10,000 people earlier this year and, uh, I guess just trying to, you know, make up some of the lost money that they've had because, uh, they're trying to, I guess, save $378 million annually.

652
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:34,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

653
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:51,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, somebody asked me earlier, we were playing that clip about the tester and all that earlier in the show.

654
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody asked me, do you know if there's going to be a tester for The Answer?

655
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:56,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I actually can answer that for you.

656
00:45:56,474 --> 00:45:58,435
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer is no, there's not going to be a tester for.

657
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:03,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why, it actually has nothing to do with the quality of the show or whatever, or whatever easy joke you want to make.

658
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:08,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when all those layoffs happened at Santa Monica Studio that majorly hit the PR department in that area?

659
00:46:09,744 --> 00:46:11,286
[SPEAKER_05]: The people who did the tester were let go.

660
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:12,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatcha gonna do?

661
00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:12,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

662
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:36,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that kind of sucks.

663
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:46,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they're saying that they are going to be letting go 840 employees as part of their lens factory in Minocomo.

664
00:46:48,374 --> 00:46:55,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they do make Blu-ray players and CD players and DVD players and cameras.

665
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of lenses.

666
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:10,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, do you think this has to... Is this the usual ebb and flow of what we see happening at game companies where projects end and people get let go?

667
00:47:10,979 --> 00:47:18,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you want to go so far as to make the argument that the PlayStation 3's performance or lack thereof is to blame for this?

668
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's neither of that.

669
00:47:19,187 --> 00:47:23,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all it is is just that they're maybe suffering losses in other areas.

670
00:47:24,492 --> 00:47:25,113
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

671
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they just don't have work for these people.

672
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:53,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they decided, hey, we don't need a reality show that kind of is alright, I guess.

673
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:55,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's costing us a lot of money to put this out.

674
00:47:56,257 --> 00:48:03,041
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, we're not seeing much of a return on people signing up for PlayStation Plus.

675
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:04,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't think that was exclusive to PlayStation Plus.

676
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:07,964
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't have people coming to our network because of the tester.

677
00:48:08,404 --> 00:48:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just cut some costs there and let's give people free games instead for PlayStation Plus.

678
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:17,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, do you think the people who won on the tester also got laid off?

679
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Can Sony lay off game testers?

680
00:48:18,731 --> 00:48:19,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yes, they can.

681
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:26,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, go back and listen to the show that had Asuka was on the show when that was new.

682
00:48:26,176 --> 00:48:28,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It ended up being the week before she was kicked off.

683
00:48:28,678 --> 00:48:35,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But she said that they would get everybody hyped up about the prize and then the cameras would cut.

684
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you guys know, it's a six-month contract.

685
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:41,407
[SPEAKER_05]: So technically, Sony was never under any obligation to hire those people.

686
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't we talk about it like a couple weeks ago?

687
00:48:43,188 --> 00:48:53,791
[SPEAKER_04]: There was the guy that, I think it was the first guy that won, and he came out like smashing, like totally dissonant on a bunch of stuff, like talking about how they've made mistakes, you know, left and right with their properties.

688
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:54,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they?

689
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:54,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

690
00:48:54,991 --> 00:48:56,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we talked about that here.

691
00:48:56,412 --> 00:48:57,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I remember reading that.

692
00:48:58,072 --> 00:48:59,214
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

693
00:49:14,533 --> 00:49:18,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know... He got into PR, so he might have... I mean, I don't know.

694
00:49:18,757 --> 00:49:19,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't speak for the guy.

695
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:21,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing to consider, too, is all these layoffs are in Japan.

696
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,421
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing in the U.S.

697
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,724
[SPEAKER_05]: But we did have the PR layoffs that happened just not that long ago.

698
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:30,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what would have happened with the third guy that won because he was a very recent winner.

699
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:33,870
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of these guys... And he was an associate producer, right?

700
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he was probably under contract somewhere or something.

701
00:49:36,793 --> 00:49:36,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

702
00:49:37,453 --> 00:49:41,115
[SPEAKER_05]: and as ShadowNextGen in chat says, any company can lay off anyone.

703
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:42,276
[SPEAKER_05]: That's absolutely right.

704
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:43,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So who knows?

705
00:49:43,837 --> 00:49:44,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

706
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:44,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Been there, done that.

707
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:46,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

708
00:49:46,938 --> 00:49:47,199
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

709
00:49:47,899 --> 00:49:48,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with more news.

710
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck to those that were impacted by this.

711
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:54,663
[SPEAKER_05]: This is never any fun to report on.

712
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:59,566
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, I'll use this as an opportunity to plug Bobby's show from tonight.

713
00:49:59,586 --> 00:50:01,907
[SPEAKER_05]: He had a great interview tonight with a game recruiter.

714
00:50:03,107 --> 00:50:26,637
[SPEAKER_05]: and who was very motivational about how to you know kind of be resilient about what happens when you get laid off and kind of what not to do and I found that very interesting because he was very honest so I'm not going to give it all away though you have to go check that out Bobby Blackwolf show which will be posted to vognetwork.com at some point this week or look him up on Stitcher as well Bobby Blackwolf let's talk about Zynga real quick

715
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Zynga is having a very interesting year.

716
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:40,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Their stock, their games, and now people seem to be abandoning ship left and right.

717
00:50:40,877 --> 00:50:43,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of these people that's left is getting sued.

718
00:50:44,298 --> 00:50:47,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the former Cityville general manager.

719
00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:50,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even realize there was a game called Cityville, but I guess that makes sense.

720
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,940
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy's name is Alan Patmore.

721
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this lawsuit, Zynga believes...

722
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:07,457
[SPEAKER_05]: The Alan Patmore uploaded company assets to a Dropbox account from his company computer both on the day before and day of his departure from the company.

723
00:51:07,477 --> 00:51:08,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a no-no.

724
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:20,190
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be information on Zynga's game mechanics, Cityville's performance assessments, monetization plans, emails, design documents, including an unreleased game design document.

725
00:51:21,071 --> 00:51:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. Patmore went to a social game company called Kick's Eye, and Zynga is alleging, again, we can't say he did it, we don't know, but Zynga's alleging in these documents that he is going to use this information to directly compete with Zynga.

726
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:48,426
[SPEAKER_05]: A quote from the lawsuit, "...could be used to improve a competitor's internal understanding and know-how of core game mechanics and monetization techniques, its execution, and ultimately its market standing to compete more effectively with Zynga."

727
00:51:49,386 --> 00:51:53,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Pat Moore apparently refused to sign a termination certification.

728
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:57,430
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying this reaffirmed all of this information.

729
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:03,593
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to block Pat Moore and his company from accessing the data and they want it back.

730
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:15,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Kixi, in an interview with All Things Digital, said they have nothing to do with the suit, but apparently they slipped this thing in at Zynga.

731
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:25,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, unfortunately, this appears to be Zynga's new employee retention strategy, suing former employees to scare current employees into staying.

732
00:52:26,281 --> 00:52:26,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

733
00:52:28,302 --> 00:52:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one thing to take company typefaces that were designed for the company.

734
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:55,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Another thing to take game mechanics.

735
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:57,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of different.

736
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's still not appropriate.

737
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:02,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't help it if they had pretty font, okay?

738
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:11,409
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I mean, let's say that if you did design work at the company, what's appropriate for you to take with you in master files?

739
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, you did it on the company clock, so they belong to the company.

740
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:15,293
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

741
00:53:15,914 --> 00:53:20,297
[SPEAKER_15]: But there is, you can keep your own work for the sake of your portfolio.

742
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:29,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just about to say, now, surely you can have like a PDF for your portfolio or whatever, but you don't get to keep... If it's stuff this guy designed, then he's entitled to retain a copy for himself.

743
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,944
[SPEAKER_15]: He just can't use it elsewhere.

744
00:53:31,104 --> 00:53:38,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but if we're talking about information on Zynga's game mechanics, assessments of the performance, that's not one person.

745
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:43,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you're saying is he had a copy of Tiny Towers on his computer that he uploaded to the Dropbox, right?

746
00:53:48,114 --> 00:53:51,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I'm... I don't know.

747
00:53:52,096 --> 00:54:03,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga... We're going to get into this a little later when we get to the Google Question of the Week, but I'm very interested to see where Zynga ends up in a few years because it really seems like that company is... It's abandoned ship fast over there.

748
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

749
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:04,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

750
00:54:06,403 --> 00:54:08,666
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of point and laugh at them every time I'm in San Francisco.

751
00:54:25,285 --> 00:54:26,686
[SPEAKER_05]: While I'm at it, fuck Facebook.

752
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:28,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know I couldn't use the Facebook?

753
00:54:28,866 --> 00:54:31,287
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how like Facebook has a separate camera application?

754
00:54:31,747 --> 00:54:32,868
[SPEAKER_05]: It would not let me use it.

755
00:54:32,928 --> 00:54:36,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It says location services are required to use this application.

756
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I said fuck you and deleted it.

757
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:40,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just use Instagram where it's optional.

758
00:54:42,000 --> 00:55:11,180
[SPEAKER_05]: and like every time I turn location stuff off on Facebook and I've talked about this before if I want to advertise where I am I'll use Foursquare otherwise I don't see the need to always post every place I'm at including my home address so turn it off but it just keeps magically coming back on on Facebook I'm about ready to go back to Google Plus I'm about ready to just delete Facebook but I've threatened that about four times on this show and I haven't done it yet so I need to put my money where my mouth is I guess

759
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:14,382
[SPEAKER_15]: On top of that, Facebook has turned into Attention Horse Central.

760
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:16,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Pay attention to me.

761
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:17,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Pay attention to me.

762
00:55:18,663 --> 00:55:20,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebook does exist on the internet.

763
00:55:21,824 --> 00:55:24,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's pay attention to your story, DarkSakura.

764
00:55:24,165 --> 00:55:25,705
[SPEAKER_15]: This is awesome because it's Sega.

765
00:55:26,726 --> 00:55:27,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Sega!

766
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,769
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you've all heard of the Model 2 arcade board, right?

767
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:33,109
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some great games on it.

768
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Virtua Fighter, well I won't say Virtua Fighter was great because I hate Virtua Fighter.

769
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:37,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you said great games.

770
00:55:37,972 --> 00:55:40,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well there's a lot of people who are fans of Virtua Fighter 2.

771
00:55:41,535 --> 00:55:43,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I only played that game to try to knock Kage's mask off.

772
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:47,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Sonic Fighters, Sonic the Fighters was great.

773
00:55:48,018 --> 00:55:50,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of my favorite ever games, Virtual Lawn.

774
00:55:51,601 --> 00:56:05,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's going to be an Xbox Live Arcade and a PlayStation Network, which is a release game that's a Model 2 collection, Virtua Fighter 2, Fighting Vipers, Cyber Trooper Virtual Lawn, Virtua Striker, and Sonic the Fighters.

775
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you what my experience with Sonic the Fighters is, is Fighters Megamix.

776
00:56:12,076 --> 00:56:16,279
[SPEAKER_15]: You could also play as the car from Daytona and beat people up with a car.

777
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:16,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

778
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:20,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I believe is another Model 2 game, right?

779
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:21,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

780
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:23,522
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was Home Only.

781
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:24,883
[SPEAKER_04]: That already came out anyway.

782
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:28,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Daytona was... No, Daytona was Model 2.

783
00:56:28,664 --> 00:56:29,945
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking Fighter's Megamix.

784
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:30,565
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, yes.

785
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:31,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already released that already a long time ago.

786
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:32,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand.

787
00:56:33,106 --> 00:56:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still another excuse to play this song.

788
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:42,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, it's going to be... For Japan pricing anyway, it's 800 Microsoft points or 10 bucks.

789
00:56:42,429 --> 00:56:45,710
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure we're going to get it, so... Yay.

790
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:47,871
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a Fighter's Megamix 2.

791
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Fighters Megamix was so much fun.

792
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:53,691
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the fun thing about playing as a car.

793
00:56:55,113 --> 00:56:55,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a car.

794
00:56:56,595 --> 00:56:56,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Punch.

795
00:56:58,178 --> 00:56:59,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Sonic versus car.

796
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:01,322
[SPEAKER_15]: That was great.

797
00:57:01,822 --> 00:57:02,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

798
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:02,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

799
00:57:04,975 --> 00:57:09,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking, I saw a Robot Chicken clip this week of Street Fighter.

800
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:21,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were... It was basically Ryu, I guess, telling people what to do as far as... He was scheduling all their fights and stuff.

801
00:57:21,684 --> 00:57:23,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the fights was...

802
00:57:24,045 --> 00:57:26,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken, he's all, I thought I was supposed to be fighting E-Honda.

803
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:27,547
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry.

804
00:57:27,787 --> 00:57:29,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That says you're fighting A-Honda.

805
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:30,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is stupid.

806
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:32,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I want to fight a car?

807
00:57:32,889 --> 00:57:33,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Just punch the car.

808
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

809
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:35,310
[SPEAKER_04]: He starts punching the car.

810
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:36,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is actually kind of cool.

811
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it was like the bonus round?

812
00:57:39,813 --> 00:57:40,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was the bonus round.

813
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:41,633
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

814
00:57:41,653 --> 00:57:43,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

815
00:57:43,454 --> 00:57:48,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so, let's talk a little bit about some cool stuff.

816
00:57:49,057 --> 00:57:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we always talk about...

817
00:57:51,178 --> 00:58:15,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Holiday or not holiday holodeck gaming as like kind of the you know oh my god everything we've ever done in gaming has been taking us one step closer to the holodeck because we were always like oh my like remember when we were kids and we all saw mode 7 for the first time like pilot wings and stuff and it's like oh my god this blows my fucking mind Dracula X on Super Nintendo like

818
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:17,802
[SPEAKER_05]: The fire's moving!

819
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:35,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of saying the same thing.

820
00:58:35,671 --> 00:58:39,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine the spectrum of what's possible in the computing world.

821
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:47,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, look at how fast everything is progressing, how the engines are getting bigger and bigger.

822
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:53,245
[SPEAKER_04]: The real exciting thing is about the people, the relationships, and the business involved and how they're working together.

823
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:55,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, there's going to be...

824
00:58:56,508 --> 00:59:05,292
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, better simulations, better... And, I mean, if you think about it, look at how far things have gone in just the last, like, 20 years, 30 years.

825
00:59:05,332 --> 00:59:07,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just been, like, holy crap.

826
00:59:07,313 --> 00:59:11,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, I mean, Super Nintendo was 1990 when that came out.

827
00:59:11,536 --> 00:59:14,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, 92 would have been right at the height of, like, Super Nintendo.

828
00:59:14,397 --> 00:59:16,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean... We're 20 years since then.

829
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:16,998
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years.

830
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine what 20 years from now is going to be?

831
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:20,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, fuck, yeah.

832
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what did the Ultra H...

833
00:59:26,428 --> 00:59:29,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Well now there's you'll get to make out with Garrus for real.

834
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:34,170
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Ultra HD now is that new thing right?

835
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:42,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was reading on the internet this week that's the now approved 4K is now Ultra HD or whatever so that's what we have to look forward to and you know 3D is already a thing.

836
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:48,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's just a matter of time before you have an environment where you can have TVs on three walls so you can like look all around you and see things in 3D.

837
00:59:48,572 --> 00:59:50,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's where we're going to be at in 20 years.

838
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:56,254
[SPEAKER_04]: That would basically be the Microsoft thing that they have with their projectors and stuff what we were talking about before.

839
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:25,033
[SPEAKER_05]: they actually are doing holographic television I was watching a special on it just like a month ago and you want to know what kind of creeps me out like now that I have an iPhone 5 you know what kind of creeps me out a little bit Siri like for real like Siri kind of creeps me out a little bit because like I can tell it open the pod bay doors yeah she's a little slow that's a rather insensitive thing to say to an intelligent agent

840
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,017
[SPEAKER_05]: See, but like she does shit like that.

841
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:30,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the other day, or no, no, this is earlier.

842
01:00:30,519 --> 01:00:32,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Like just earlier today, I hit the little button.

843
01:00:32,561 --> 01:00:34,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, Siri, wake me up in 30 minutes.

844
01:00:34,783 --> 01:00:35,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And she goes, okay.

845
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:37,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I set the alarm for, you know, 440 or whatever it was.

846
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:40,488
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just out of habit, I went, thank you.

847
01:00:40,528 --> 01:00:40,968
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

848
01:00:41,228 --> 01:00:43,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And she goes, I live to serve.

849
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:47,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, I just talked to my iPhone.

850
01:00:47,514 --> 01:00:47,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

851
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:48,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You live to serve.

852
01:00:48,655 --> 01:00:49,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you programmed?

853
01:00:49,436 --> 01:00:50,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you ever told Siri goodnight?

854
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:52,118
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I never had.

855
01:00:52,138 --> 01:00:53,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Goodnight to you too.

856
01:00:54,389 --> 01:01:00,351
[SPEAKER_05]: See, we're getting a little closer to this Cylon thing that has me a little bit worried.

857
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:06,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Artificial intelligence has really taken off in 20 years too.

858
01:01:06,352 --> 01:01:07,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm saying.

859
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:10,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine that type of interaction in a Mass Effect type of game?

860
01:01:11,153 --> 01:01:11,814
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

861
01:01:12,154 --> 01:01:13,494
[SPEAKER_14]: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?

862
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:15,815
[SPEAKER_05]: No one cares.

863
01:01:16,515 --> 01:01:16,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Hush.

864
01:01:18,495 --> 01:01:20,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because it could doesn't mean that it would.

865
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:28,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't it just say, stop fucking wasting my time with stupid and mean questions?

866
01:01:30,669 --> 01:01:33,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't she get offended if you go like, fuck you or whatever?

867
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,150
[SPEAKER_15]: You are entitled to your opinion.

868
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Or, this is about you, not about me.

869
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,131
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's my favorite.

870
01:01:39,171 --> 01:01:42,491
[SPEAKER_15]: You can also, though, ask her how to make meth and it'll pull up the chemical formula.

871
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:47,852
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you go up to her and you go, hey, how you doing?

872
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:49,392
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like friends.

873
01:01:51,453 --> 01:01:52,053
How you doing?

874
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:54,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm testing it out.

875
01:01:57,492 --> 01:01:58,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Siri's thinking about it.

876
01:02:00,094 --> 01:02:01,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Beep, beep.

877
01:02:02,215 --> 01:02:02,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

878
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:03,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that was boring.

879
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:04,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me try one here.

880
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:07,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Where could I score some marijuana?

881
01:02:10,421 --> 01:02:11,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Rob.

882
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:12,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have that schedule.

883
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:14,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Schedule?

884
01:02:15,325 --> 01:02:16,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I'm sorry.

885
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:18,467
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't take the train to Marijuana Town.

886
01:02:19,007 --> 01:02:20,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I like this one.

887
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:22,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Where can I hide a body?

888
01:02:26,181 --> 01:02:28,003
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of place are you looking for?

889
01:02:28,603 --> 01:02:37,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Funeral services, mortuaries, swamps, metal foundries, cremation services, reservoirs, mines, or dumps.

890
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:40,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal foundries?

891
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:42,176
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this, Terminator?

892
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:43,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, turn that bitch off.

893
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:44,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

894
01:02:44,338 --> 01:02:45,880
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

895
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:46,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Where were we?

896
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:47,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Holodeck.

897
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:49,743
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I stop Skynet?

898
01:02:51,215 --> 01:02:56,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so holodeck gaming, of course it's always going to be the goal.

899
01:02:57,097 --> 01:03:07,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it seems to be the whole 3D is coming back, the whole VR stuff is almost coming back a little bit with that Oculus Rift stuff.

900
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course more of the haptic technologies are kind of taking off.

901
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:15,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure in 10 years time we'll have...

902
01:03:16,522 --> 01:03:20,485
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some pretty interesting interactions with the computers.

903
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,746
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to become more seamless.

904
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:30,473
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just like, you know, if you think about it now, you know, like 30 years ago, someone told you, yeah, you're going to be carrying around computers with you.

905
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:36,217
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like everybody's like had that whole futuristic fantasy of like a wristwatch computer thing.

906
01:03:36,257 --> 01:03:37,278
[SPEAKER_04]: But look at it.

907
01:03:37,298 --> 01:03:40,441
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got like an HD screen in the palm of your hand.

908
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:43,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically better than what you...

909
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:49,709
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 years ago, you had a 40 megabyte drive in your computer and that was like Uber storage for everything.

910
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you can store what, like almost a thousand times that in a little tiny chip in your hand?

911
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,097
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

912
01:03:57,657 --> 01:04:00,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting.

913
01:04:00,987 --> 01:04:04,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm glad that our game developers are already thinking about the holodeck.

914
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,451
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good sign.

915
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad it doesn't matter because the world's going to end this.

916
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:08,813
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

917
01:04:09,514 --> 01:04:11,555
[SPEAKER_05]: No one believes that, except for crazy people.

918
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:14,478
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

919
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:19,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one thing that the holodeck may not have in it is Facebook and Twitter.

920
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,304
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because Microsoft is doing away with it.

921
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:27,288
[SPEAKER_05]: In their fall 2012 update, Twitter and Facebook are going to be gone from the dashboard.

922
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:30,010
[SPEAKER_05]: These apps are officially being retired.

923
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:30,730
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

924
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:31,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's be real, though.

925
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:33,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's talking about this on the Internet.

926
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:34,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's mentioning this.

927
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:58,534
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet if they had just deleted them, a lot of you would have never known.

928
01:04:58,574 --> 01:05:01,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Because seriously, when was the last time you used Twitter on your Xbox?

929
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:04,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you when you used Twitter on your Xbox.

930
01:05:04,842 --> 01:05:11,390
[SPEAKER_05]: You loaded it up the first day it came out and wrote a tweet that said, Hi from my Xbox 360 LOL butts goodbye.

931
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:13,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was probably the last time you did it.

932
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:24,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of making Twitter and Facebook so terribly difficult to use in the Xbox 360, why couldn't they have implemented it into the dashboard?

933
01:05:25,176 --> 01:05:27,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because that would have taken too much work.

934
01:05:29,277 --> 01:05:31,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Because before it was like, okay, you had to exit out of your game.

935
01:05:31,498 --> 01:05:38,540
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to exit out of all this other stuff to see information on Twitter or Facebook.

936
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But Windows Messenger, you can get messages on that and you can see them pop up.

937
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:53,785
[SPEAKER_04]: But why can't you just have the same thing on the dashboard for the Xbox 360 where you can pop it up immediately, just hit the guide button or something like that and see that.

938
01:05:53,865 --> 01:05:55,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, because that would be too much work.

939
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:59,567
[SPEAKER_04]: We want you to use our shitty fucking internet browser, Internet Explorer.

940
01:06:00,267 --> 01:06:08,893
[SPEAKER_05]: If a console really wanted to be cutting edge, you should be able to press one button and get a menu and hit Facebook and your feed comes right up.

941
01:06:08,973 --> 01:06:15,237
[SPEAKER_05]: None of this loading time, none of this going out of the app, it needs to be embedded or it's useless.

942
01:06:15,357 --> 01:06:23,482
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's also kind of stupid that, well, I mean, I'm sure they're proud of Internet Explorer, but no one's like, fuck yeah, I get to use Internet Explorer on my Xbox.

943
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call it the Xbox web browser.

944
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:30,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because Internet Explorer doesn't mean fucking kick-ass.

945
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:32,650
[SPEAKER_04]: It means fucking garbage is what it means.

946
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:36,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Because Microsoft is not going to give up on their branding, end of story.

947
01:06:36,754 --> 01:06:42,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the thing I use to go fucking download Firefox or Google Chrome.

948
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:48,566
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I use it the one time when I load in my operating system to download that fucking program if I don't already have it on Jump Drive.

949
01:06:48,906 --> 01:06:50,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now here's the thing.

950
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:52,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say this about the Facebook application.

951
01:06:52,648 --> 01:06:56,509
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one thing that I did think was very useful about that Facebook application.

952
01:06:56,989 --> 01:07:03,212
[SPEAKER_05]: You could go in and you could instantly see what your friends, your people on Facebook, what their gamer tags were.

953
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:09,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were like their friend on Facebook and they connected to the Xbox, you could see their gamer tag so you could easily add people to your Xbox friends list.

954
01:07:10,134 --> 01:07:10,895
[SPEAKER_05]: That was useful.

955
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they will retain that in some capacity.

956
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,456
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really all I can think of.

957
01:07:14,796 --> 01:07:43,713
[SPEAKER_05]: of course they still have not upped the limit I was just about to say so I can't add anybody else anyway but you know if somebody decides to you know face if somebody decides to Xbox break up with me as this happened in the past then I'll have a couple slots where I can add more people and I would like them to be people I know on Facebook and what have you so let's see Black Wolf in our chat says hey guys remember we could watch videos on our 360 without loading a Zoom video app those were good times

958
01:07:46,425 --> 01:07:48,527
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to make this stuff easier, not more difficult.

959
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:50,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Their apps thing is kind of dumb.

960
01:07:51,169 --> 01:07:55,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what bugs me about Mass Effect 3 on Origin and why I keep giving Origin a bad time.

961
01:07:56,433 --> 01:08:03,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Origin, if you want to get it right, I should be able to load Mass Effect 3 and instantly go into a multiplayer game.

962
01:08:04,018 --> 01:08:04,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Instantly!

963
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:07,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Not five minutes later.

964
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,062
[SPEAKER_14]: And not have to verify my DLC.

965
01:08:09,162 --> 01:08:09,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

966
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the stuff that's starting to bug me.

967
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:16,223
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what's going to keep the holodeck from happening.

968
01:08:16,623 --> 01:08:17,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit.

969
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:19,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Bullshit is going to stop the holodeck from happening.

970
01:08:20,025 --> 01:08:24,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we're headed towards the holodeck, but we are having to go through so much bullshit to get there.

971
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:30,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, we can't authenticate your person because you've gotten a haircut.

972
01:08:31,312 --> 01:08:31,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

973
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:33,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back in two months once your hair has grown out.

974
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:35,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

975
01:08:37,015 --> 01:08:45,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how they were talking about, and I don't even know anybody that would ever do this, where you would leave your Xbox 360 on and Kinect would recognize your face and log you in?

976
01:08:46,403 --> 01:08:53,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I can hit the guide button and just log myself in probably infinitely faster than that stupid thing.

977
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't have to have Kinect hooked up.

978
01:08:55,971 --> 01:09:01,999
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100, Matt in our chatroom says, at live.vognetwork.com says, where is my MySpace or GeoCities app?

979
01:09:02,499 --> 01:09:04,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't GeoCities finally officially close?

980
01:09:04,402 --> 01:09:05,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're gone.

981
01:09:05,123 --> 01:09:06,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally gone.

982
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:09,228
[SPEAKER_05]: MySpace, however, it's coming back, baby.

983
01:09:12,308 --> 01:09:41,050
[SPEAKER_04]: to be fair I use the Twitter app or I use the Twitter app in Xbox about as often as I use well maybe a couple more times on the Vita but I haven't really used it on the Vita or the Facebook app because I have a phone I mean that's the thing kind of nowadays it's cool they have this integration and weren't they going to have it where you can send like screenshots of your gameplay and stuff like that on Facebook some games have that like NBA 2K13 or whatever why don't we just add that to all games instead of just you know

984
01:09:41,770 --> 01:10:07,221
[SPEAKER_05]: here's the other thing like i'm now gonna access twitter on my phone okay ready tap tap wait there's my feed it's up and it's already refreshed that's how long it took me to get twitter up on my phone that's why i prefer to use my phone because you know how long that would have taken me to do on my vita you know it would have been and then like oh downloading new update but

985
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:10,843
[SPEAKER_05]: and then like, oh, going to connecting to Twitter.

986
01:10:12,325 --> 01:10:13,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Downloading tweets.

987
01:10:13,906 --> 01:10:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it doesn't work that fast.

988
01:10:15,568 --> 01:10:16,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.

989
01:10:17,569 --> 01:10:18,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray for you getting Twitter.

990
01:10:18,851 --> 01:10:19,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Now make it work better.

991
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:22,394
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway.

992
01:10:24,434 --> 01:10:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on with DarkSakura.

993
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:34,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, real quick, I was going to say it's even more ironic the fact that they're getting rid of Facebook and Twitter is how integrated that stuff is in Windows 8.

994
01:10:35,368 --> 01:10:41,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of seems a little backwards that we're getting this Windows 8 dashboard thing on the Xbox, and yet they're not having that same type of integrations.

995
01:10:41,536 --> 01:10:46,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe they're able to do it instantly on the desktop where they are having that problem on the Xbox for whatever reason.

996
01:10:46,257 --> 01:10:49,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

997
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:51,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Tangled yarn.

998
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:53,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you knitting during the show?

999
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:54,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm crocheting, thank you.

1000
01:10:54,378 --> 01:10:55,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, crocheting.

1001
01:10:55,178 --> 01:10:59,519
[SPEAKER_15]: But my ball of cheap-ass yarn has got a tangle in it.

1002
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:01,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Never buy yarn from the dollar store.

1003
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:08,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, how many people liked Elder Scrolls 3 and liked Oblivion?

1004
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:09,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Me.

1005
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:09,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Me.

1006
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:11,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Who liked Kingdoms of Amalur?

1007
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:15,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play it.

1008
01:11:15,874 --> 01:11:16,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear it's not bad.

1009
01:11:17,935 --> 01:11:19,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we should give it too much shit.

1010
01:11:19,215 --> 01:11:23,977
[SPEAKER_15]: The lead designer for those two Elder Scrolls games, Ken Rolston, jumped ship.

1011
01:11:24,457 --> 01:11:31,159
[SPEAKER_15]: He's off with Turbine now, which is the developer for Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons and Dragons Online, which I'm kind of playing low tour.

1012
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,920
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty.

1013
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,821
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got cherry blossoms, so I like it.

1014
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:39,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically,

1015
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:57,685
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to see if I can... Yeah, he basically said they're, like, really excited to have him, and I guess that Oblivion... Well, that the Elder Scrolls franchise will just have to keep going with whoever the new people are.

1016
01:11:58,206 --> 01:12:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, he didn't have Skyrim on his resume.

1017
01:12:00,587 --> 01:12:00,807
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1018
01:12:00,927 --> 01:12:11,412
[SPEAKER_05]: That game turned out all right, so... But still, I mean, I'm not... This guy, obviously, it's a name I've heard before, and I know he's contributed a lot to these franchises, so I think any company's lucky to have him.

1019
01:12:11,672 --> 01:12:12,692
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's wearing a beret.

1020
01:12:12,712 --> 01:12:13,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha ha!

1021
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,872
[SPEAKER_05]: which instantly makes somebody awesome.

1022
01:12:17,013 --> 01:12:17,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1023
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:23,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games you can look forward to real soon and it is getting to be that time of year, right?

1024
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:26,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already been that time of year for a few weeks now.

1025
01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:28,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean like next month is a huge month, right?

1026
01:12:29,591 --> 01:12:30,091
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so bad.

1027
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:32,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there's a lot of games coming out.

1028
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:38,054
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, of course, we had Skylanders Giants come out today along with all those wonderful packs and stuff.

1029
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: That was on PS3, Xbox 360, the Wii, and the 3DS and PC.

1030
01:12:44,056 --> 01:12:46,597
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Vita this week, we get Street Fighter X Tekken.

1031
01:12:47,817 --> 01:12:52,299
[SPEAKER_04]: On PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Medal of Honor Warfighter.

1032
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:56,680
[SPEAKER_04]: On PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013.

1033
01:12:58,201 --> 01:12:59,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they have a bundle with this

1034
01:12:59,781 --> 01:13:04,857
[SPEAKER_04]: FearMasterGun, it senses your fear your fear of playing a mediocre game but it senses it

1035
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:11,640
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be a gun for Silent Hill or something like that.

1036
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,761
[SPEAKER_04]: A fear gun.

1037
01:13:14,021 --> 01:13:14,502
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

1038
01:13:14,622 --> 01:13:15,482
[SPEAKER_04]: It senses your heart.

1039
01:13:15,602 --> 01:13:22,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically the Nintendo sensor thing that never came out.

1040
01:13:23,327 --> 01:13:24,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's the Vitality Sensor.

1041
01:13:24,848 --> 01:13:26,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's the Vitality Sensor for Cabela's.

1042
01:13:28,811 --> 01:13:33,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they also have Cabela's Hunting Expeditions on the same systems as well.

1043
01:13:33,134 --> 01:13:37,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that was something that was originally being developed for the Vitality Sensor, but when that kind of went away,

1044
01:13:38,237 --> 01:13:38,358
No.

1045
01:13:38,598 --> 01:13:39,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, maybe not.

1046
01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:40,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried.

1047
01:13:40,559 --> 01:13:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Dance Disney Party on Xbox 360 and Wii.

[SPEAKER_04]: Zero Escape Virtue's Last Reward on 3DS and the Vita.

1049
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what else we got here.

1050
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this week, Myst on the 3DS.

1051
01:13:58,433 --> 01:13:59,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's been delayed a few weeks.

1052
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:01,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it's coming out this week.

1053
01:14:01,516 --> 01:14:05,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Naughty Bear Double Trouble on PS3 and it's both mediocre Naughty Bear games.

01:14:22,898 --> 01:14:23,679
[SPEAKER_04]: They are trying.

1057
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:27,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart as on the... Not smart ass.

01:14:27,864 --> 01:14:28,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart as.

[SPEAKER_04]: That's also this week.

1061
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That's supposed to be a brain training game.

1062
01:14:36,995 --> 01:14:37,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1063
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:42,598
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got some controller kind of game combos.

[SPEAKER_04]: They also have the Infamous Collection with a metallic blue controller.

1066
01:14:51,879 --> 01:14:54,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the last one?

1067
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,201
[SPEAKER_04]: It was another one of their collections that they released with a silver controller.

1068
01:14:59,261 --> 01:14:59,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1069
01:14:59,841 --> 01:15:00,401
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not important.

1070
01:15:00,681 --> 01:15:01,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Those games are already out anyways.

1071
01:15:02,281 --> 01:15:04,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask on the 3DS.

1075
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:42,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that Muv Love or Muff Love?

1076
01:15:43,221 --> 01:15:46,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost said Muff Love, but it is Muv Love.

1077
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:50,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it's an anime, but then again, yet again, here we are.

1078
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:50,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this.

1079
01:15:51,524 --> 01:15:51,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1080
01:15:52,024 --> 01:15:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: This is too great.

1081
01:15:52,765 --> 01:15:54,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to post a screenshot chat.

1082
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:57,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry to the podcast listeners who can't see this, but look this game up.

[SPEAKER_05]: MUV-LUV, okay?

01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:00,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Because look at this.

1085
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:08,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You got these Japanese girls in school outfits, da-da-da-da-da, and this one is sucking on a hot dog in the corner, and then what the fuck

1086
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:11,412
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck is this bitch down here?

1087
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:15,094
[SPEAKER_05]: She's in a barrel or a bundle of sticks or something.

1088
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:18,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to post that for the chatties.

1089
01:16:18,936 --> 01:16:19,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1090
01:16:19,336 --> 01:16:19,997
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1091
01:16:20,297 --> 01:16:21,077
[SPEAKER_05]: That is amazing.

1092
01:16:21,137 --> 01:16:22,638
[SPEAKER_05]: That is absolutely amazing.

1093
01:16:22,698 --> 01:16:23,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1094
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Now wait, what's Muv Love Alternative?

1095
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that going to be the one with the dudes on it?

1096
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see.

1097
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:27,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1098
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:30,038
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1099
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:32,219
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't even the same game.

1100
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:32,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

1101
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's like chick with the sword.

1102
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:35,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1103
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same, but that doesn't even look the same at all.

1104
01:16:38,503 --> 01:16:39,944
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe it's like the dark version.

1105
01:16:41,365 --> 01:16:43,666
[SPEAKER_05]: Like one's all about love and one's about killing.

1106
01:16:44,807 --> 01:16:46,908
[SPEAKER_15]: One's like the cutesy, happy universe.

1107
01:16:46,928 --> 01:16:49,229
[SPEAKER_15]: The other's like the cyber baby universe.

1108
01:16:49,249 --> 01:16:50,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I need help.

1109
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:51,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Live chatters.

1110
01:16:52,371 --> 01:16:54,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys tend to know this stuff when I don't.

1111
01:16:54,312 --> 01:16:55,593
[SPEAKER_05]: What is muv love?

1112
01:16:55,773 --> 01:16:56,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody tell me.

1113
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:58,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to know now.

1114
01:17:00,226 --> 01:17:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't say a lot about these games on the... It's an adventure game.

1115
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:07,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, does that mean... An adventure through panties?

1116
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:08,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, here.

1117
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:09,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's a YouTube here.

1118
01:17:10,473 --> 01:17:11,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Every anime game ever!

1119
01:17:12,255 --> 01:17:14,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, that told me nothing.

1120
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, Total Eclipse...

1121
01:17:24,503 --> 01:17:26,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that totally summed it up for me.

1122
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:26,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1123
01:17:26,705 --> 01:17:31,608
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, oh, it's even bigger, even more love, something.

1124
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:32,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Play it again.

1125
01:17:33,109 --> 01:17:34,149
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, don't play it.

1126
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:35,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason says it's a visual novel.

1127
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:37,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Read Japanese porn.

1128
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:46,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and to be fair, that is definitely a bundle of straw and not necessarily a barrel.

1129
01:17:47,575 --> 01:17:54,258
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, I have bought a Japanese digital novel that they had in the US.

1130
01:17:54,418 --> 01:17:55,879
[SPEAKER_15]: They put it on Sega CD.

1131
01:17:56,199 --> 01:17:56,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right, right.

1132
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,941
[SPEAKER_15]: It was by the guy who created Cobra.

1133
01:18:01,902 --> 01:18:06,444
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation 3 this week in Japan also gets Heartful Simulator Pachislot to Heart 2.

1134
01:18:07,324 --> 01:18:09,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Pachislot means, you know what, pachinko game.

1135
01:18:10,217 --> 01:18:37,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Two Hearts Anime Series Dark Souls with Atorias of the Abyss Edition I'm assuming that's the Dark Souls DLC bundled with a regular game Borderlands 2, Bioshock in a 2K collection price reduction I'm assuming gearing up for the sequel next year and Killzone Trilogy also released on the PlayStation 3 again these are all Japanese releases this week on the PlayStation Vita this week Street Fighter X Tekken in Japan as well as Next Rev

1136
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:47,191

1138
01:18:51,033 --> 01:18:51,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good lord.

1139
01:18:51,913 --> 01:18:52,954
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a little girl group.

1140
01:18:53,514 --> 01:18:53,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is it?

1141
01:18:54,175 --> 01:19:04,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, AKB48 is like this, I guess it's kind of this pop group that keeps cycling in, you know, kind of like Minuto was, you know?

1142
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:04,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, sure.

1143
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:05,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1144
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:06,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Morning Musume?

1145
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1146
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:08,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, kind of.

1147
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,153
[SPEAKER_15]: But Morning Musume was also like a variety show.

1148
01:19:10,673 --> 01:19:11,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right, right.

1149
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:15,638
[SPEAKER_15]: But AKB48, they're like top 40 list everything.

1150
01:19:16,278 --> 01:19:16,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1151
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there it is, your Japanese release dates.

1152
01:19:19,261 --> 01:19:21,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the UK, DarkSakura.

1153
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:23,752
[SPEAKER_15]: As soon as I get to the list.

1154
01:19:25,353 --> 01:19:25,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1155
01:19:26,393 --> 01:19:30,316
[SPEAKER_15]: We have, well, on today, which means it's already yesterday there.

1156
01:19:30,676 --> 01:19:32,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to say it was Cairo, but it's Calro.

1157
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:34,238
[SPEAKER_15]: K-A-L-R-O.

1158
01:19:34,839 --> 01:19:40,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Then on the 23rd, there's Hotline Miami, Killzone HD, and Medal of Honor Warfighter.

1159
01:19:40,803 --> 01:19:44,505
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 24th, Killzone Trilogy, PlayStation, All-Stars Battle Royale.

1160
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:46,806
[SPEAKER_15]: The 25th, Incredipede.

1161
01:19:48,147 --> 01:19:53,028
[SPEAKER_15]: and the 26 Forza Horizon Roller Coaster Tycoon and Super Monkey Ball Banana Splits.

1162
01:19:54,148 --> 01:19:57,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to be confused with the TV show of the same name from the 60s.

1163
01:19:59,409 --> 01:20:01,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So, thanks to the chatters, did a little research.

1164
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:06,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Muv Love, it was an adult game on the PC in February of 2003.

1165
01:20:07,631 --> 01:20:13,412
[SPEAKER_05]: They redid these with the adult content removed on the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1166
01:20:14,252 --> 01:20:14,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, right?

1167
01:20:14,792 --> 01:20:15,352
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the point?

1168
01:20:16,092 --> 01:20:21,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Muv-Luv Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, and then Muv-Luv Alternative came out a little later in 2006.

1169
01:20:21,977 --> 01:20:30,084
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm assuming this is some type of repackaged stuff, or it's like the game's re-revised, up-rezzed, or whatever, reimagining.

1170
01:20:30,584 --> 01:20:31,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, because...

1171
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,041
[SPEAKER_05]: They show later release dates there.

1172
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: October 25th on the PlayStation 3.

1173
01:20:37,122 --> 01:20:39,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess this game's been around a little while.

1174
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:40,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have never played it.

1175
01:20:40,783 --> 01:20:42,304
[SPEAKER_05]: But now I kind of want to.

1176
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:45,505
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to know what the girl in the straw is all about.

1177
01:20:47,486 --> 01:20:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1178
01:20:48,846 --> 01:20:49,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1179
01:20:49,227 --> 01:20:49,947
[SPEAKER_05]: That's release dates.

1180
01:20:49,967 --> 01:20:52,028
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more stories and then the classic game of the week.

1181
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,028
[SPEAKER_14]: We have, by the way, been graced with Maruko.

1182
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:55,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Maruko.

1183
01:20:56,129 --> 01:20:57,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he finally decide to stop being shy?

1184
01:20:58,568 --> 01:20:59,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me scratch his butt.

1185
01:20:59,709 --> 01:21:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.

1186
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Stick his tail in the air.

1187
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:02,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at my butt.

1188
01:21:02,432 --> 01:21:04,233
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the closest I've ever seen him get to Loki.

1189
01:21:04,253 --> 01:21:05,094
[SPEAKER_05]: He must be getting used to it.

1190
01:21:05,554 --> 01:21:08,377
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyhow.

1191
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:11,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We interrupt this kitty appearance for more gaming news.

1192
01:21:14,022 --> 01:21:16,864
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so let's talk a little bit about Steam Greenlight.

1193
01:21:16,884 --> 01:21:22,309
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got some new games that have been given the go-ahead, and those are 21 new games.

1194
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:23,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is kind of cool.

1195
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these are actually backed on Kickstarter.

1196
01:21:25,992 --> 01:21:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but see, Afterfall, Insanity, Extended Edition, Air Buccaneers, Blockscape, Contrast, Flyin', Folktale, Forge, The Gianna Sisters, Twisted Dreams, which is Project Gianna, that was the one I backed and it's fucking awesome.

1197
01:21:37,836 --> 01:21:38,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1198
01:21:38,896 --> 01:21:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, Genorm, Genoria, I guess?

1199
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:44,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Nomoria?

1200
01:21:44,518 --> 01:21:45,738
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Nomoria, that's what it was.

1201
01:21:46,418 --> 01:21:59,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Interstellar Marines, Lost Story, The Last Days of Earth, Mia Samada, Minor Wars 2081, Neo Tokyo, Octodad, Dadlius Ketch, Perpetuum, Postal 2 Complete, The Secrets of Grindia,

1202
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:24,674
[SPEAKER_04]: The Intruder, The Stanley Parable HD Remix which is also supposed to be a pretty awesome source game and Yogg Ventures those are going to be the 21 new games that they're going to be adding to the Steam store at some point soon

1203
01:22:25,314 --> 01:22:34,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also, of course, the non-gaming area, which they added recently, is also added to Steam Greenlight as well.

1204
01:22:34,098 --> 01:22:40,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you can begin voting on submissions for other stuff that's not necessarily software.

1205
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:45,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what exactly is on there yet, but I'm probably going to go poke around that at some point.

1206
01:22:45,622 --> 01:23:13,566
[SPEAKER_04]: and last but not least they're also adding a new thing to Steam Greenlight which is called Concepts basically allows you to post your game without the $100 fee to gauge kind of interest in what people would want to you know if people would be even interested in your game and so if you get a lot of interest then you may pony up the $100 to you know have it actually greenlit and put on the Steam store so that's kind of neat sounds like that project's doing very well for them yeah sounds pretty cool

1207
01:23:14,728 --> 01:23:15,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, awesome.

1208
01:23:16,308 --> 01:23:19,949
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more story for you guys, then we'll get into the classic game of the week.

1209
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:22,790
[SPEAKER_05]: This is another legal story.

1210
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of, wow.

1211
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:35,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Rushton, who was the founder and president of Sensory Sweep Studios, they were in Utah, he got sentenced to 12 months in the slammer.

1212
01:23:36,033 --> 01:23:41,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Find $1.2 million in unpaid wages to more than 100 employees.

1213
01:23:42,097 --> 01:23:45,439
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes all the way back to a lawsuit from 2009 by the U.S.

1214
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Labor.

1215
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, employees claimed they were not paid in over 100 days for their work.

1216
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:56,506
[SPEAKER_05]: The employees also alleged their 401k money had been stolen by the company.

1217
01:23:57,586 --> 01:24:12,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave Rushton has already served jail time for other charges relating to the company he pled guilty to one third degree felony charge of failing to file taxes and one second degree felony charge of engaging in a pattern of unlawful activity this is all according to the Salt Lake Tribune

1218
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:14,432
[SPEAKER_05]: How not to run your business

1219
01:24:40,336 --> 01:24:41,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta pay your... That's right.

1220
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:50,422
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta, you know, if you're gonna, you know, hire people, you do have to send them a paycheck at some point or they might get angry because they're kind of waiting on you to pay them to say they can like pay their mortgage.

1221
01:24:50,482 --> 01:24:52,403
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of things they want to do.

1222
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:56,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And you probably want to pay your taxes as well.

1223
01:24:57,110 --> 01:25:00,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when you are the head of a company like that.

1224
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:03,053
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can just write it off for your horse.

1225
01:25:03,113 --> 01:25:10,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're a singer, like Lauryn Hill, or who else got busted for tax evasion?

1226
01:25:10,537 --> 01:25:11,057
[SPEAKER_05]: They get caught.

1227
01:25:11,257 --> 01:25:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: The guy who won Survivor?

1228
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:14,219
[SPEAKER_05]: They all end up getting caught.

1229
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:16,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Wesley Snipes?

1230
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.

1231
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big one too.

1232
01:25:18,861 --> 01:25:21,502
[SPEAKER_15]: But remember, that's how they got Capone.

1233
01:25:23,023 --> 01:25:23,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1234
01:25:23,763 --> 01:25:24,204
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

1235
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:24,984
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how they got Capone.

1236
01:25:26,004 --> 01:25:26,304
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1237
01:25:26,985 --> 01:25:28,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's travel to a classic time.

1238
01:25:28,725 --> 01:25:43,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe not as classic as DarkSakura is referring to, but let's go back a few years into gaming's history and a classic video game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, brats, play this game or else I'll kill you.

1239
01:25:43,230 --> 01:25:44,350
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can find it, good luck.

1240
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can find it.

1241
01:25:45,651 --> 01:25:48,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I can say tonight's game, I had never fucking heard of this game.

1242
01:25:49,512 --> 01:25:50,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I had never heard of this game.

1243
01:25:50,532 --> 01:25:52,033
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got the Namco collection, right?

1244
01:25:52,665 --> 01:25:54,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Valkyrie no Bokken, Toki no Kagi Densetsu

1245
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:17,233
[SPEAKER_15]: The game title translates to The Adventure of Valkyrie, The Legend of the Time Key.

1246
01:26:18,393 --> 01:26:22,054
[SPEAKER_15]: And it came out on... This is the Famicom version.

1247
01:26:22,294 --> 01:26:22,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1248
01:26:22,974 --> 01:26:26,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is sort of overhead-y, Zelda-ish, scroll-y.

1249
01:26:27,435 --> 01:26:29,796
[SPEAKER_15]: It actually, with the way the enemies appear, makes me think of Zelda 2.

1250
01:26:31,777 --> 01:26:32,657
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love the music.

1251
01:26:32,877 --> 01:26:35,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just say the other English name people would know this by?

1252
01:26:35,438 --> 01:26:36,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend of the Valkyrie.

1253
01:26:36,418 --> 01:26:37,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope, that's actually the sequel.

1254
01:26:37,839 --> 01:26:38,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my bad, okay.

1255
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:40,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is why I said two games.

1256
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:40,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

1257
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:41,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Oops.

1258
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1259
01:26:43,961 --> 01:26:46,722
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically for the original one, you're in Marvel Land.

1260
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:54,513
[SPEAKER_15]: and basically you have to get the Key of Time back from whoever stole it.

1261
01:26:54,593 --> 01:27:02,925
[SPEAKER_15]: It actually really has a lot in common with Dragon Warrior and the real-time combat system of The Legend of Zelda.

1262
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:09,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, this was, it has absolutely no text in the game.

1263
01:27:11,132 --> 01:27:19,899
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a patch that changes the title screen if you've got the, like if you're playing it on an emulator.

1264
01:27:20,759 --> 01:27:27,165
[SPEAKER_15]: And look for the one that was done by DVD Translations, that one is the best.

1265
01:27:27,905 --> 01:27:38,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, there is a sequel, and this is the one that people have probably heard of, is Valkyrie No Densetsu, which is The Legend of the Valkyrie.

1266
01:27:38,734 --> 01:27:43,818
[SPEAKER_15]: And this came out in 1989 as an arcade game, and then it came out on the PC Engine in Japan.

1267
01:27:44,379 --> 01:27:45,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is the sequel to the 1986 Famicom game.

1268
01:27:48,702 --> 01:27:50,704
[SPEAKER_15]: This one also came out in the U.S.

1269
01:27:50,744 --> 01:27:52,686
[SPEAKER_15]: as part of Namco Museum Vol.

1270
01:27:52,706 --> 01:27:59,392
[SPEAKER_15]: 5, the O. And the PC Engine version came out on the Virtual Console in Japan.

1271
01:27:59,952 --> 01:28:02,675
[SPEAKER_15]: And this one is basically a two-player game.

1272
01:28:02,755 --> 01:28:06,819
[SPEAKER_15]: The player one has Valkyrie, and the second one has Krino Sandra.

1273
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:29,569
[SPEAKER_15]: which was romanized actually as Zandra with an X-A-N-D-R-A and was named um Whirlo in the English version of uh the prequel which was uh Zandra no Daibouken Valkyrie no Valkyrie Tono Dei I think is how it's pronounced um who's a green lizard and basically it's you know a lot of

1274
01:28:31,736 --> 01:28:38,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Over the World, scrolling, shooting, punching enemies in the face with your sword, going into little huts and buying stuff.

1275
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:40,942
[SPEAKER_15]: It's such an adorable game.

1276
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:51,554
[SPEAKER_15]: If people don't have the O from the Namco collection, which as I understand the O is a little hard to find, get this game.

1277
01:28:51,614 --> 01:29:05,842
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a really, really fun little game and it is fully translated and available in the US if you can find the Namco O. It actually though has a different ending from the arcade version.

1278
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:08,884
[SPEAKER_15]: With the home version you do have a level save.

1279
01:29:09,705 --> 01:29:14,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually have, Rob, I've got the Famicom version of the first game.

1280
01:29:15,213 --> 01:29:17,457
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have the HuCard of this too.

1281
01:29:18,198 --> 01:29:20,261
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was very happy to pick those up.

1282
01:29:20,874 --> 01:29:25,196
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, it's just really, it's a straightforward little, you know, adventure game.

1283
01:29:26,597 --> 01:29:30,839
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very Zelda slash Dragon Quest-y.

1284
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:35,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, maybe it's the cartoony style or something, but I'm suddenly reminded of Willow.

1285
01:29:36,002 --> 01:29:36,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1286
01:29:36,482 --> 01:29:37,482
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I love that game.

1287
01:29:37,502 --> 01:29:40,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just thinking about like, I want to play Willow again.

1288
01:29:40,184 --> 01:29:44,026
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like all the little monsters and the little Valkyrie are all chibi and adorable.

1289
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:44,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1290
01:29:45,266 --> 01:29:49,728
[SPEAKER_15]: And, I mean, but you can get super powered up.

1291
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:55,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you see how on this video here we're watching how she's jumping from platform to platform?

1292
01:29:55,851 --> 01:30:00,594
[SPEAKER_15]: That used to always screw me up because I would think that it was over the regular ground and I'd walk off of them.

1293
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:05,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I know better, but the first time I tried to play it, it was actually pretty difficult.

1294
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:07,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to check this video out over here.

1295
01:30:07,324 --> 01:30:12,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping some dude isn't talking over this, but this is the main version, so I'm assuming this is just a direct arcade version.

1296
01:30:12,266 --> 01:30:15,027
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hope it's without any dudes talking over it.

1297
01:30:16,147 --> 01:30:17,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see what happens here.

1298
01:30:17,248 --> 01:30:17,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1299
01:30:18,608 --> 01:30:19,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

1300
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:21,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this looks okay.

1301
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:22,430
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty much the same thing.

1302
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:27,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it definitely has that arcade-style interface, though, but okay.

1303
01:30:28,352 --> 01:30:31,413
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I mean, the PC Engine version is damn good.

1304
01:30:31,873 --> 01:30:32,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1305
01:30:32,113 --> 01:30:32,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1306
01:30:34,771 --> 01:30:35,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I've checked this out at some point.

1307
01:30:36,132 --> 01:30:48,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I'll tell you where I first heard about this game is I had a gachapon capsule that was a little Namco figurine set.

1308
01:30:48,415 --> 01:30:50,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan and I tried to collect all of them and one of them was a Valkyrie.

1309
01:30:51,116 --> 01:30:52,617
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, oh, this is pretty cool.

1310
01:30:52,837 --> 01:30:56,418
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it turned out that, hey, there's this whole game and you should play it.

1311
01:30:56,478 --> 01:30:59,179
[SPEAKER_15]: And, oh, yeah, we actually have that because we have it on the Namco O. Yeah.

1312
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:02,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Zandra no Daibouken, Valkyrie to no Daibouken

1313
01:31:17,571 --> 01:31:43,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Valkyrie Tonodai I think I'm pronouncing that right and pulling this one up that translates to Zandra's Great Adventure a counter with the Valkyrie and that's the little green lizard man meeting up with the Valkyrie chick and that one though is a side scrolling game it's a lot different I usually I'd say that for any of them my favorite of the three is the Valkyrie No Densets so totally awesome game

1314
01:31:44,948 --> 01:32:09,879
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's the classic game and I'm sticking to it alright there it is your classic game of the week a couple of games there but we'll say Valkyrie no Densetsu as that seems to be the one that if you're going to go find this game that's probably going to be the one you're going to find if you want to play it in English it's on the Namco Classics which was the Playstation version and it's the letter O

1315
01:32:10,506 --> 01:32:10,926
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1316
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:13,347
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1317
01:32:13,407 --> 01:32:15,087
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a nice, obscure pick.

1318
01:32:15,308 --> 01:32:15,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

1319
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:18,949
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1320
01:32:18,969 --> 01:32:25,131
[SPEAKER_05]: There's plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio to come for tonight, including your emails, or is it lack thereof once again?

1321
01:32:26,011 --> 01:32:33,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we're going to have some news on some things going on with Kickstarter, more lawsuit news, and you are not going to believe what happened with this PC release.

1322
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:39,095
[SPEAKER_05]: The Google Question of the Week and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1323
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1324
01:32:47,892 --> 01:32:54,896
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live on this October the 21st of 2012 with the 478th episode of our show.

1325
01:32:55,757 --> 01:32:59,679
[SPEAKER_05]: During the music break there, we can't play these on the podcast because, you know, copyright reasons and all that.

1326
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:02,181
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will say we played a song there from Second Detsetsu 3.

1327
01:33:03,082 --> 01:33:07,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It was giving the chatters a hard time trying to figure out what game that was from.

1328
01:33:07,264 --> 01:33:09,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Did anybody ever play that when it had the translated cartridge?

1329
01:33:09,546 --> 01:33:10,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I played that, too.

1330
01:33:10,186 --> 01:33:11,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I played through about half of it.

1331
01:33:11,227 --> 01:33:11,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.

1332
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:18,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I still say though to this day, Secret of Evermore was sadly hazed and underrated by the folks here.

1333
01:33:18,352 --> 01:33:19,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Secret of Evermore wasn't a bad game.

1334
01:33:20,013 --> 01:33:28,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I do understand it was a different, you know, it was the one square USA title that, you know, for whatever reason, people didn't seem to like it as much.

1335
01:33:29,018 --> 01:33:30,019
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyhow.

1336
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:37,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, before we get into rapid fire news, you were playing during the break there this interesting music shooter game you were mentioning before.

1337
01:33:38,024 --> 01:33:40,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I had mentioned it on the show before because it was something I kickstarted.

1338
01:33:40,566 --> 01:33:41,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called Rhythm Destruction.

1339
01:33:42,188 --> 01:33:48,514
[SPEAKER_04]: And since they got funded and they're kickstarting it, basically, I think it was like five bucks and you get the game.

1340
01:33:48,554 --> 01:33:55,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game, it's interesting because the way it plays, it's a shooter, like a top-down shooter, space shooter, I guess.

1341
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:55,980
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1342
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:59,903
[SPEAKER_04]: All the shooting is done as a rhythm game.

1343
01:34:00,103 --> 01:34:05,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So the enemies come up on the screen and you see a circle come around them and you have to hit them with the beat of the music.

1344
01:34:05,627 --> 01:34:09,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And it uses an Xbox 360 controller so they're mapped to the face buttons.

1345
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:16,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all the dodging of bullets and stuff is done with the analog sticks and your triggers are kind of like a boost type thing.

1346
01:34:16,514 --> 01:34:20,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're dodging stuff and having to do the rhythm game part, which is kind of really cool.

1347
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:22,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got music from Kyle Wardner.

1348
01:34:22,899 --> 01:34:25,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing one that was a Kaa song.

1349
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:29,782
[SPEAKER_04]: He shows up in the strangest places music game wise, doesn't he?

1350
01:34:30,102 --> 01:34:30,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for him.

1351
01:34:30,803 --> 01:34:31,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for him.

1352
01:34:31,563 --> 01:34:32,844
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a pretty awesome game.

1353
01:34:33,004 --> 01:34:33,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta pay the bills.

1354
01:34:34,885 --> 01:34:35,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1355
01:34:35,445 --> 01:34:39,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not really sure where... I think you can buy it off their website.

1356
01:34:40,287 --> 01:34:47,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to remember where it is because, you know, obviously... I don't think they... I think they're trying to get...

1357
01:34:49,315 --> 01:34:50,556
[SPEAKER_04]: onto the Steam store.

1358
01:34:50,656 --> 01:34:51,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they've done it.

1359
01:34:51,637 --> 01:34:52,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, here we go.

1360
01:34:52,697 --> 01:34:54,398
[SPEAKER_04]: RhythmDestruction.com.

1361
01:34:54,518 --> 01:34:55,359
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check it out.

1362
01:34:55,459 --> 01:34:57,500
[SPEAKER_04]: It's by a company called Curious Pandas.

1363
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: The group did it.

1364
01:34:59,482 --> 01:35:01,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you can... Pandas, you say?

1365
01:35:02,784 --> 01:35:03,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Pandas.

1366
01:35:03,604 --> 01:35:07,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can buy the game on maybe...

1367
01:35:09,855 --> 01:35:10,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1368
01:35:10,515 --> 01:35:12,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a buy it now on the website.

1369
01:35:12,156 --> 01:35:17,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to see $4.99 is all they're asking for when you pay for it with PayPal.

1370
01:35:17,357 --> 01:35:18,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good luck.

1371
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:19,758
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty awesome.

1372
01:35:19,918 --> 01:35:20,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I like music games.

1373
01:35:20,678 --> 01:35:21,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I like shooters.

1374
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth it.

1375
01:35:22,298 --> 01:35:23,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a pretty awesome game.

1376
01:35:24,779 --> 01:35:25,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

1377
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:25,919
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1378
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:35,222
[SPEAKER_14]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BRAIN.

1379
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:41,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get into some rapid fire news before we get to the Fugo question of the week, which tonight is all about Zynga.

1380
01:35:41,304 --> 01:35:41,987
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

1381
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:42,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1382
01:35:43,618 --> 01:35:45,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Far Cry 3 Locations and Character Skins

1383
01:36:09,454 --> 01:36:09,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Far Cry 3 Far Cry 3

1384
01:36:36,167 --> 01:36:37,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirt Rob, Dirt and Water Sundermen

1385
01:36:56,807 --> 01:36:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's scary.

1386
01:36:57,708 --> 01:36:59,550
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

1387
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:00,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Borderlands 2.

1388
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Slenderman.

1389
01:37:02,552 --> 01:37:02,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Enderman.

1390
01:37:04,474 --> 01:37:07,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Ops 2 on the Wii U is not going to have Call of Duty Elite.

1391
01:37:07,977 --> 01:37:12,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Because all the other systems are going to be getting Call of Duty Elite at launch.

1392
01:37:12,361 --> 01:37:14,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they're kind of doing it as a free thing.

1393
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:19,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of having to pay $60 for all the perks of Elite, you can get everything for free.

1394
01:37:19,987 --> 01:37:22,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just pay $60 for a map pack instead.

1395
01:37:22,769 --> 01:37:23,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the...

1396
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:25,552
[SPEAKER_04]: and subscription for the map packs.

1397
01:37:25,572 --> 01:37:27,974
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really why they got Elite in the first place.

1398
01:37:29,575 --> 01:37:31,437
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the Wii U is not getting the support.

1399
01:37:31,497 --> 01:37:36,441
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, we're currently evaluating options for Call of Duty Elite to support Nintendo's Wii U game system.

1400
01:37:36,501 --> 01:37:42,726
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Call of Duty Elite for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 will not support this platform when the game launches November 13th.

1401
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:46,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes me wonder, what is borked about their fucking online?

1402
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:47,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of...

1403
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:53,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty Late is kind of like this app thing.

1404
01:37:53,572 --> 01:38:00,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're not going to allow these third-party apps for the Wii U dashboard or whatever.

1405
01:38:00,539 --> 01:38:03,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what didn't make the show roll tonight that's worth talking about?

1406
01:38:03,682 --> 01:38:06,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you hear about the updates with Nintendo Voice Chat?

1407
01:38:07,378 --> 01:38:27,923
[SPEAKER_05]: and how they're not selling a headset they're going to be third party headsets and if you use the Nintendo Pro Controller there is no space for a headset so you have to have your Wii Pad with the headset and the Wii Pad and then your Pro Controller not looking good for Nintendo convincing me they understand online finally not looking good

1408
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:32,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised we didn't put that story in here because I could have gone on a whole tangent about that.

1409
01:38:32,837 --> 01:38:35,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, not thrilled by that news.

1410
01:38:36,499 --> 01:38:37,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at all.

1411
01:38:37,299 --> 01:38:43,501
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be not so bad if that system supports Bluetooth and they have Bluetooth headsets and stereo stuff as well.

1412
01:38:44,922 --> 01:38:48,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that they're not doing a first-party headset because they're going to support any headset.

1413
01:38:48,783 --> 01:38:54,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently on the gamepad they do have a spot for headphones but not necessarily a headset type thing.

1414
01:38:55,426 --> 01:38:56,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently...

1415
01:38:57,928 --> 01:39:03,476
[SPEAKER_04]: You can enable it, but at default it's disabled to use the microphone that's actually on the gamepad for...

1416
01:39:06,212 --> 01:39:06,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Chat.

1417
01:39:07,693 --> 01:39:08,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1418
01:39:09,535 --> 01:39:17,381
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact we haven't heard much about it other than, hey, check out this, like, I don't even know what the fuck they're calling it, the Mii Plaza or whatever the fuck their community thing is.

1419
01:39:17,661 --> 01:39:18,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, check this out.

1420
01:39:18,642 --> 01:39:19,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guess what?

1421
01:39:19,142 --> 01:39:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: You can leave messages for friends and games.

1422
01:39:21,684 --> 01:39:22,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1423
01:39:22,465 --> 01:39:23,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what about accounts?

1424
01:39:23,446 --> 01:39:25,147
[SPEAKER_04]: What about, like, achievements and stuff like that?

1425
01:39:25,487 --> 01:39:27,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, check out this, like, Mii Plaza thing.

1426
01:39:27,249 --> 01:39:28,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you can leave messages for friends and games.

1427
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all it's going to be.

1428
01:39:30,211 --> 01:39:30,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.

1429
01:39:30,912 --> 01:39:32,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that and a shop and that's it.

1430
01:39:32,853 --> 01:39:34,855
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1431
01:39:56,192 --> 01:39:57,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it doesn't make any sense.

1432
01:39:57,673 --> 01:40:00,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, here's something else that's not coming to the Wii U version.

1433
01:40:01,177 --> 01:40:03,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, the Wii U version is going to be kind of similar to the rest of them.

1434
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:07,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think, I don't know, I think something's borked with their online.

1435
01:40:07,662 --> 01:40:14,028
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it is, because this should be something that should be easily implemented, but it's not for whatever reason.

1436
01:40:15,649 --> 01:40:17,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last but not least, Obsidian.

1437
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:24,592
[SPEAKER_04]: They've concluded their Project Eternity Kickstarter at $3.9 million raised.

1438
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:31,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess that's even more than Double Fine Adventures got.

1439
01:40:31,394 --> 01:40:33,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember, Double Fine Adventures had $3.3 million.

1440
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:34,035
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1441
01:40:34,055 --> 01:40:35,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, good for them.

1442
01:40:35,595 --> 01:40:36,756
[SPEAKER_04]: They beat that.

1443
01:40:36,856 --> 01:40:37,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know...

1444
01:40:40,018 --> 01:40:43,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess Planetary Annihilation was another one similar to that.

1445
01:40:44,622 --> 01:40:46,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Multi-million dollar raise.

1446
01:40:46,944 --> 01:40:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: They got 2.2 million and the OUYA had 8.5 million.

1447
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:56,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost backed this but I saw that the game wasn't coming out until 2014 so I'll wait.

1448
01:40:57,133 --> 01:40:58,954
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not something I want to back.

1449
01:41:00,035 --> 01:41:01,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You need your games to be designed faster.

1450
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:20,622
[SPEAKER_04]: well it's just that's kind of a long ways and and I'm assuming that you know they're not necessarily going to hit their you know date for that stuff because like for example the Kickstarter I did for my very first Kickstarter which was for VGHS video game high school they still haven't delivered the DVDs on that stuff yet

1451
01:41:20,802 --> 01:41:21,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1452
01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:41,930
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1453
01:41:42,591 --> 01:41:44,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about free games?

1454
01:41:44,512 --> 01:41:47,634
[SPEAKER_05]: We like free, and this is a very interesting sort of free game.

1455
01:41:48,694 --> 01:41:53,517
[SPEAKER_05]: This is being developed by NeoGAF members, you know, the big popular gaming forum, right?

1456
01:41:53,877 --> 01:42:00,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they formed a studio called Grimoire Assembly Forge, and they're creating this parody on modern shooters.

1457
01:42:00,501 --> 01:42:01,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Dude Bro 2.

1458
01:42:02,923 --> 01:42:07,446
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual title is, Dude Bro, my shit is fucked up, so I gotta shoot slice you too.

1459
01:42:07,486 --> 01:42:08,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It's straight up dog time.

1460
01:42:09,987 --> 01:42:10,368
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1461
01:42:10,608 --> 01:42:14,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based off of a meme that someone was, like, complaining about something.

1462
01:42:14,231 --> 01:42:17,274
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, well, why don't you just go play Dude Bro 2?

1463
01:42:18,435 --> 01:42:22,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone started, like, making character art and started doing, like, box art.

1464
01:42:22,598 --> 01:42:25,221
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like bungee ferret tossing.

1465
01:42:25,341 --> 01:42:27,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody took the joke way too far.

1466
01:42:27,082 --> 01:42:27,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha, I gotcha.

1467
01:42:28,944 --> 01:42:31,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, though, you want to talk about the joke going way too far.

1468
01:42:31,647 --> 01:42:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: John St.

1469
01:42:32,307 --> 01:42:32,647
[SPEAKER_05]: John.

1470
01:42:33,368 --> 01:42:33,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You know John St.

1471
01:42:34,008 --> 01:42:34,188
[SPEAKER_05]: John?

1472
01:42:34,248 --> 01:42:35,849
[SPEAKER_05]: He is Duke Nukem.

1473
01:42:35,869 --> 01:42:36,609
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the voice of Duke Nukem.

1474
01:42:36,669 --> 01:42:37,969
[SPEAKER_05]: He will be John Dude Bro.

1475
01:42:38,009 --> 01:42:39,150
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to play the song.

1476
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:40,490
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's in the trailer.

1477
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:41,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this the little trailer song?

1478
01:42:42,011 --> 01:42:42,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's in the trailer.

1479
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:44,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me play a little clip of it here.

1480
01:42:46,192 --> 01:42:48,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's straight up dog time.

1481
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:52,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a rap even.

1482
01:43:02,151 --> 01:43:05,155
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks pretty awesome.

1483
01:43:05,315 --> 01:43:06,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks very old school.

1484
01:43:06,677 --> 01:43:08,779
[SPEAKER_05]: At least in these cutscenes.

1485
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:20,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Commander Keen or something.

1486
01:43:20,258 --> 01:43:27,180
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually kind of rad.

1487
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,080
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where Duke Nukem got its start, really.

1488
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:30,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of cool.

1489
01:43:31,501 --> 01:43:32,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I like free.

1490
01:43:33,901 --> 01:43:38,202
[SPEAKER_05]: PlayStation All-Stars apparently have been hacked into Super Smash Bros.

1491
01:43:38,302 --> 01:43:38,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl.

1492
01:43:39,702 --> 01:43:42,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how this happened, but yeah, this is some modders.

1493
01:43:42,966 --> 01:43:57,324
[SPEAKER_05]: They developed the Smash Brothers, but they actually have some of the PlayStation All-Stars, but they put some other people into this as well, like Nico Bellic from Grand Theft Auto 4, John Marston from Red Dead Redemption, Laura Croft from Tomb Raider, Old Snake from Metal Gear Solid.

1494
01:43:57,364 --> 01:43:58,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's a hack.

1495
01:43:59,426 --> 01:44:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't have to worry about licensing or anything.

1496
01:44:01,587 --> 01:44:03,027
[SPEAKER_05]: They just put whoever the fuck they want in there.

1497
01:44:03,947 --> 01:44:10,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Kazuya from Tekken, Tomba, Isaac Clark from Dead Space, get this, Commander Shepard from Mass Effect.

1498
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:11,530
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's Man Shep.

1499
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:12,870
[SPEAKER_15]: So it doesn't count.

1500
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:20,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free mod, but again, you will have to mod and do all that stuff.

1501
01:44:20,475 --> 01:44:26,379
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think those mods, I'm not sure with the whole character skins and models and stuff like that.

1502
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:29,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of them you can do with just an SD card.

1503
01:44:29,102 --> 01:44:30,723
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even need to mod your system.

1504
01:44:30,743 --> 01:44:33,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just going through a hacked save type thing.

1505
01:44:33,425 --> 01:44:35,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So that might be one of those.

1506
01:44:35,306 --> 01:44:35,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1507
01:44:35,787 --> 01:44:37,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really researched it too much.

1508
01:44:37,808 --> 01:44:40,170
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and one other story about Nintendo Land.

1509
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:43,832
[SPEAKER_05]: The final little mini games inside Nintendo Land have been announced.

1510
01:44:44,293 --> 01:44:52,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain Falcon's Twister Race, where you hold the narrow end of the Wii U gamepad upright to guide a high-speed wind-up vehicle towards the finish line.

1511
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:54,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Octopus Dance.

1512
01:44:57,085 --> 01:44:58,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't say it without laughing.

1513
01:44:58,786 --> 01:45:00,847
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a single-player rhythm-based game.

1514
01:45:00,867 --> 01:45:01,908
[SPEAKER_05]: You use the gamepad.

1515
01:45:01,948 --> 01:45:08,471
[SPEAKER_05]: You memorize the movement of the character on the screen and reenact the poses using the control sticks or the gyro sensor.

1516
01:45:09,272 --> 01:45:11,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, Yoshi's Fruit Cart.

1517
01:45:12,914 --> 01:45:15,195
[SPEAKER_05]: What, are you a fan of Yoshi's Fruit Cart, DarkSakura?

1518
01:45:15,535 --> 01:45:16,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It just made me snort.

1519
01:45:16,475 --> 01:45:19,877
[SPEAKER_05]: You guide Yoshi's Cart towards the goal while collecting fruit on the way.

1520
01:45:20,017 --> 01:45:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, that's not just a clever name.

1521
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:24,760
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see fruit on the TV but not the gamepad.

1522
01:45:27,706 --> 01:45:29,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like innovation to me.

1523
01:45:30,248 --> 01:45:30,668
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1524
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:31,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey.

1525
01:45:31,709 --> 01:45:40,634
[SPEAKER_04]: So, now you being a big fan of F-Zero, do you think that homage is worthy of, like, you know, they're going to get the fans excited about F-Zero with this wonderful game?

1526
01:45:40,654 --> 01:45:42,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they can stop being fucking cocktease.

1527
01:45:42,355 --> 01:45:43,176
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what they can do.

1528
01:45:44,056 --> 01:45:47,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to hell that... That's a page out of Capcom's book right there.

1529
01:45:47,578 --> 01:45:51,681
[SPEAKER_05]: That better be the secret project that Retro or whatever is working on is the new F-Zero.

1530
01:45:51,701 --> 01:45:52,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, hey, hey, hey.

1531
01:45:52,581 --> 01:45:56,044
[SPEAKER_05]: F-Zero wind-up shit that you don't care about.

1532
01:45:56,264 --> 01:45:58,926
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, I give no fucks about anything else.

1533
01:45:59,466 --> 01:46:01,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It better not be Pilotwings or some shit.

1534
01:46:01,348 --> 01:46:02,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It better be fucking F-Zero.

1535
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: We already remade Pilotwings.

1536
01:46:05,771 --> 01:46:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1537
01:46:06,252 --> 01:46:09,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pilotwings, the remake of Pilotwings is fucking terrible.

1538
01:46:09,454 --> 01:46:10,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Three goddamn things.

1539
01:46:10,975 --> 01:46:11,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't go that far.

1540
01:46:13,157 --> 01:46:38,733
[SPEAKER_04]: 3 fucking events way to go Nintendo way to not like even put any effort in that's Nintendo doing the least bit of work so we can sell some shit that people will buy anyways because we're fucking Nintendo there just needs to be a Captain Falcon game where all he does is punch people now that would have been a classic minigame that would have been great Falcon punch show me your move

1541
01:46:40,447 --> 01:46:46,074
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Pikmin 3 is going to be on the Wii U and no one is excited.

1542
01:46:47,155 --> 01:46:50,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, that came from Iwata making that little announcement.

1543
01:46:52,461 --> 01:46:55,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up, do you want to learn about video games at school, Rob?

1544
01:46:56,394 --> 01:46:57,614
[SPEAKER_05]: No, school sucks.

1545
01:46:57,834 --> 01:46:58,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Bite me.

1546
01:46:58,735 --> 01:46:59,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I like school.

1547
01:47:00,055 --> 01:47:08,457
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a class that is at Rice University in Houston, Texas called Scandinavian Fantasy Worlds, Old Norse Sagas, and Skyrim.

1548
01:47:09,598 --> 01:47:25,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically it's, and I'm reading the quote here, introduces students to fantasy as both psychological concept and the driving force in gamer culture by having students read selections from Old Norse and Old Icelandic sagas in translation and as they play different quests in Skyrim.

1549
01:47:27,156 --> 01:47:37,002
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's pretty awesome because there's a part of the midterm where you get to give your best last but not least Just Dance 4

1550
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:38,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-oh.

1551
01:48:02,136 --> 01:48:07,039
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, I have actually just introduced a friend of mine to the video last night, so it was pretty funny.

1552
01:48:07,079 --> 01:48:07,959
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what you did, right?

1553
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:08,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1554
01:48:08,659 --> 01:48:09,140
[SPEAKER_05]: You went there.

1555
01:48:15,783 --> 01:48:16,403
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the album.

1556
01:48:18,484 --> 01:48:20,846
[SPEAKER_05]: All I have to say, look, I... The album's good.

1557
01:48:21,346 --> 01:48:23,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of already over this, but...

1558
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:32,132
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really weird to turn on the radio on a top 40 station nonetheless and hear this song played.

1559
01:48:32,272 --> 01:48:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Not as an act of parody.

1560
01:48:34,173 --> 01:48:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Not as a, lol, listen to this.

1561
01:48:36,414 --> 01:48:38,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Not as, hey, this is what the kids on the internet are.

1562
01:48:38,135 --> 01:48:38,315
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1563
01:48:38,776 --> 01:48:41,237
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear, up next, Psy with Gangnam Style.

1564
01:48:41,297 --> 01:48:43,078
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was PSY.

1565
01:48:43,838 --> 01:48:45,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people were saying Psy.

1566
01:48:45,259 --> 01:48:51,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Because in one of the songs, it does this little thing where they say the name of the person and it's PSY.

1567
01:48:52,343 --> 01:48:52,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, whatever.

1568
01:48:52,904 --> 01:48:53,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

1569
01:48:54,696 --> 01:49:03,370
[SPEAKER_15]: but actually it's a good album and I really like I think the song's called Passionate Goodbye it's a really good song so I like the album

1570
01:49:04,096 --> 01:49:04,396
[SPEAKER_05]: JustMyStyle

1571
01:49:28,232 --> 01:49:32,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, just wait until he releases his US album.

1572
01:49:32,634 --> 01:49:33,274
[SPEAKER_05]: That is happening.

1573
01:49:33,314 --> 01:49:35,035
[SPEAKER_05]: He did get signed to a US label.

1574
01:49:35,976 --> 01:49:38,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Buying it.

1575
01:49:38,737 --> 01:49:39,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin Bieber's label, too.

1576
01:49:41,718 --> 01:49:44,799
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy, though, not Justin Bieber, but Psy, you have to admit, he's super adorable.

1577
01:49:45,019 --> 01:49:46,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen him in interviews and stuff?

1578
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,841
[SPEAKER_05]: You just want to pinch his cheeks.

1579
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:49,481
[SPEAKER_05]: He's so cute.

1580
01:49:50,462 --> 01:49:51,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean that in a totally...

1581
01:49:54,369 --> 01:50:17,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Bro Way like he's just he's really just I don't know there's something about him he's got a great personality the album seriously I think it's like seven bucks on iTunes and it was totally a worthwhile purchase for me not just trying to sell it but it was pretty pretty good I love driving to it I'll put it that way I drive very fast no I like the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack if I want to drive fast

1582
01:50:19,315 --> 01:50:20,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish they'd do another one of those games.

1583
01:50:21,116 --> 01:50:21,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1584
01:50:22,798 --> 01:50:23,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1585
01:50:23,138 --> 01:50:23,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are we at?

1586
01:50:23,638 --> 01:50:24,159
[SPEAKER_05]: What time is it?

1587
01:50:24,259 --> 01:50:26,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's Fugle Question of the Week time.

1588
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:26,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray!

1589
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:39,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook, smash it with Google+, and together you get Foogle.

1590
01:50:39,062 --> 01:50:41,304
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where our segment comes from.

1591
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:45,148
[SPEAKER_05]: We ask a question in our fan communities every week, and we read some of our favorite answers.

1592
01:50:45,808 --> 01:50:47,210
[SPEAKER_05]: The question was short and sweet tonight.

1593
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:50,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we've been talking a little bit about Zynga and some of the things that have been going on over there.

1594
01:50:51,513 --> 01:50:55,014
[SPEAKER_05]: The question this week is, in 10 years, how do you think people will remember Zynga?

1595
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,035
[SPEAKER_05]: What will their mark on history look like?

1596
01:50:57,355 --> 01:50:59,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know, and I'm looking for some serious answers here.

1597
01:50:59,696 --> 01:51:02,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some of you want to take the cheap, easy way out and say, LOL, poop.

1598
01:51:03,177 --> 01:51:04,638
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I'm really curious.

1599
01:51:04,698 --> 01:51:05,698
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they going to be remembered by?

1600
01:51:06,598 --> 01:51:06,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1601
01:51:07,239 --> 01:51:07,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Google+.

1602
01:51:09,167 --> 01:51:18,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Redertainment says, I believe the answer to this question will depend on how many of the people who currently actively play Zynga games will in 10 years time succumb to dementia.

1603
01:51:18,754 --> 01:51:20,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's like 10 years.

1604
01:51:20,756 --> 01:51:21,036
[SPEAKER_05]: 10, not 45.

1605
01:51:21,897 --> 01:51:22,217
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 10.

1606
01:51:24,078 --> 01:51:24,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1607
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:29,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend668 on Google Plus says, Zing who?

1608
01:51:29,762 --> 01:51:31,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Already fading from my mind.

1609
01:51:32,424 --> 01:51:34,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Monster B says, what was Zynga?

1610
01:51:35,326 --> 01:51:38,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sean F says, no, people may not remember Facebook.

1611
01:51:40,171 --> 01:51:41,633
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a good point, though.

1612
01:51:42,514 --> 01:51:44,856
[SPEAKER_05]: How much longer is the Facebook fad going to last?

1613
01:51:45,997 --> 01:51:48,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Their stock sure doesn't seem to indicate it'll last much longer.

1614
01:51:49,141 --> 01:51:49,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1615
01:51:50,122 --> 01:51:51,363
[SPEAKER_05]: But people can't stop using it.

1616
01:51:51,944 --> 01:51:57,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, if you want to see more answers from Google+, head to our community, Orange Lounge Radio on Google+.

1617
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some of the answers tonight.

1618
01:51:59,732 --> 01:52:00,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Facebook.

1619
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:11,243
[SPEAKER_05]: and some of the answers we got on Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio for our frugal question of the week about Zynga.

1620
01:52:12,734 --> 01:52:14,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm waiting for it to load.

1621
01:52:14,334 --> 01:52:14,915
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there we go.

1622
01:52:15,175 --> 01:52:17,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, I remember this story from Bobby Blackwolf.

1623
01:52:17,715 --> 01:52:23,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'll forever remember them as the only company I ever said no to when their recruiter contacted me.

1624
01:52:23,917 --> 01:52:24,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably for the best.

1625
01:52:25,717 --> 01:52:34,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Codeman says, a company that made a very addictive crack kind of addicting games and secretly taking our money like a reverse tooth fairy.

1626
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:36,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, you've given them money?

1627
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:37,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Secretly?

1628
01:52:39,813 --> 01:52:41,335
[SPEAKER_05]: You just admitted something on the show.

1629
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:42,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1630
01:52:42,616 --> 01:52:43,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Lauren T says,

1631
01:52:49,927 --> 01:52:53,328
[SPEAKER_05]: and almost completely alienating its loyal players.

1632
01:52:54,509 --> 01:52:58,690
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good answer from Lauren, a company that alienated its loyal players.

1633
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:02,491
[SPEAKER_05]: How not to do... Why are you showing me animated GIFs while I'm trying to do this segment?

1634
01:53:02,531 --> 01:53:03,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is in the chat room.

1635
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:12,054
[SPEAKER_05]: What is... It's a football player doing the... Oh, is he... I didn't even catch that at first.

1636
01:53:12,074 --> 01:53:13,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, can I read the answers from Facebook?

1637
01:53:13,275 --> 01:53:13,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess.

1638
01:53:15,311 --> 01:53:20,853
[SPEAKER_05]: RedTheHay says, it'll be remembered as that company that made those games like those other games but wasn't Gameloft.

1639
01:53:23,034 --> 01:53:31,978
[SPEAKER_05]: AZHP says, I'm guessing if people still talk about them in 10 years, they'll talk about Zynga the same way the people who talk about Neopets do now.

1640
01:53:32,598 --> 01:53:34,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember when Neopets was a thing, DarkSakura?

1641
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:36,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Lord, I do.

1642
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:36,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I played it.

1643
01:53:37,025 --> 01:53:49,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we were talking about how technology is advancing so fast and stuff that in 10 years, who knows if that type of gaming will be even popular because they'll have stuff that's comparable to what we're playing on consoles right now on the mobile devices.

1644
01:53:50,278 --> 01:53:52,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Acidic Vampire says, is that a legendary Pokemon?

1645
01:53:55,500 --> 01:54:01,122
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw says in 10 years they will be known as the one company to single-handedly destroy the concept of social gaming.

1646
01:54:01,182 --> 01:54:03,723
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty powerful stuff there, but perhaps.

1647
01:54:05,284 --> 01:54:10,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Burr responded saying, we'll remember Zynga the same way we remember MySpace compared to 10 years ago.

1648
01:54:10,665 --> 01:54:17,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Although honestly, to be in a retentive here for a minute, was MySpace really a thing 10 years ago or was that when Friendster was the big deal?

1649
01:54:18,048 --> 01:54:19,488
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years is a long time in tech terms.

1650
01:54:19,508 --> 01:54:20,829
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I never used Friendster.

1651
01:54:21,029 --> 01:54:21,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

1652
01:54:21,469 --> 01:54:21,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1653
01:54:22,089 --> 01:54:22,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I never used it.

1654
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:23,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Never used it?

1655
01:54:24,918 --> 01:54:25,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

1656
01:54:25,839 --> 01:54:26,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1657
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:35,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt J said, they will forever be remembered by me as that company with those horrible apps I had to block which was responsible for the downturn of Facebook.

1658
01:54:37,219 --> 01:54:37,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1659
01:54:38,921 --> 01:54:40,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Other answers here.

1660
01:54:40,843 --> 01:54:42,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Steven M says, Farmville, that's it.

1661
01:54:43,606 --> 01:54:46,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Hitstun says, Zynga taught us an all-important lesson.

1662
01:54:46,069 --> 01:54:49,753
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want your game to make the big bucks, it doesn't have to be original or good.

1663
01:54:50,113 --> 01:54:51,595
[SPEAKER_05]: It just has to be annoying.

1664
01:54:51,916 --> 01:54:52,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And Endwithville.

1665
01:54:53,397 --> 01:54:53,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And Endwithville.

1666
01:54:54,418 --> 01:54:56,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to read this long answer here from Matt J because it's pretty good.

1667
01:54:57,842 --> 01:55:00,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Truthfully, in my opinion, they'll certainly be remembered.

1668
01:55:00,805 --> 01:55:03,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel that they'll be remembered for a couple of things.

1669
01:55:03,207 --> 01:55:05,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, really just for Farmville and the legacy it created.

1670
01:55:06,089 --> 01:55:09,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It helped to create a market for Facebook games, really for social network games in general.

1671
01:55:10,313 --> 01:55:15,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I do believe there were some before Farmville, but they never really got the light of day they have now until Farmville.

1672
01:55:15,818 --> 01:55:21,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga will be remembered in the end for creating the Farmville phenomenon and helping to create a new gaming platform.

1673
01:55:24,145 --> 01:55:26,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmville is the game that got so many into Facebook gaming.

1674
01:55:26,926 --> 01:55:32,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Surely there will be some footnotes in the history books for Zynga seemingly stealing ideas from others and the lawsuits involved.

1675
01:55:32,968 --> 01:55:37,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, some will remember the foaming hatred some in the gaming community had and have for Zynga.

1676
01:55:37,669 --> 01:55:41,490
[SPEAKER_05]: However, most will simply remember one little word, Farmville.

1677
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:48,312
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be the biggest thing Zynga will be remembered for, Farmville and helping launch the Facebook social network gaming phenomenon.

1678
01:55:48,832 --> 01:55:56,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good answer there that, you know, hate them all you want now, but when you look back on history, it's really going to be about Farmville and the social stuff.

1679
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:58,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Good answers from everybody.

1680
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry I didn't have time to read them all, but a whole lot of you responded tonight.

1681
01:56:01,523 --> 01:56:06,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to read all of the answers, which were very good.

1682
01:56:06,467 --> 01:56:13,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll remember the day that someone drew a tank through their business and spelled out Sega in bullets.

1683
01:56:14,334 --> 01:56:14,654
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1684
01:56:14,974 --> 01:56:15,354
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding.

1685
01:56:16,355 --> 01:56:17,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, that hasn't happened yet.

1686
01:56:17,436 --> 01:56:19,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't say that kind of stuff on this show.

1687
01:56:19,356 --> 01:56:20,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want the po-po coming over.

1688
01:56:20,817 --> 01:56:21,717
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wouldn't do it.

1689
01:56:21,797 --> 01:56:30,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you can remember them by the fact that they probably popularized freemium gaming and made it a little bit more popular as far as a business model that everybody's going to start using.

1690
01:56:32,754 --> 01:56:35,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll remember the day that I blocked FarmVille.

1691
01:56:36,676 --> 01:56:42,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll remember every other day that Facebook has unblocked FarmVille.

1692
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:44,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little ashamed to say that I did play FarmVille.

1693
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:45,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I will tell you this.

1694
01:56:45,441 --> 01:56:46,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it to impress a guy.

1695
01:56:47,482 --> 01:56:48,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I never played FarmVille.

1696
01:56:48,983 --> 01:56:49,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Never touched it.

1697
01:56:49,883 --> 01:56:52,585
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I blocked it, I never got another thing for it.

1698
01:56:52,885 --> 01:56:56,507
[SPEAKER_15]: However, my mother would keep saying, Why are my cows dying?

1699
01:56:56,567 --> 01:56:57,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Or something like that.

1700
01:56:57,867 --> 01:56:59,888
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be like, You don't have cows, Mom.

1701
01:56:59,908 --> 01:57:00,409
[SPEAKER_15]: You've never... Oh...

1702
01:57:02,489 --> 01:57:08,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Cow's Dying Now, Digimon, Dying... Hey, I love Digimon.

1703
01:57:10,657 --> 01:57:12,378
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Digimon better than Pokemon, I'll put it that way.

1704
01:57:12,398 --> 01:57:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Tamagotchis.

1705
01:57:12,799 --> 01:57:13,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Tamagotchis.

1706
01:57:13,139 --> 01:57:14,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're trying to think of, yeah.

1707
01:57:15,321 --> 01:57:17,363
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's do some more long news, Loki.

1708
01:57:18,112 --> 01:57:18,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Neopets.

1709
01:57:19,593 --> 01:57:20,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1710
01:57:21,035 --> 01:57:22,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Ubisoft.

1711
01:57:22,416 --> 01:57:22,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, hold on.

1712
01:57:22,937 --> 01:57:24,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta correct something BlackWolf said in chat.

1713
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:26,900
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf said, Alan likes FarmVille.

1714
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:27,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Confirm.

1715
01:57:27,581 --> 01:57:29,323
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this was pre-Alan.

1716
01:57:29,623 --> 01:57:32,586
[SPEAKER_05]: This was another guy several years ago when FarmVille first came out.

1717
01:57:33,026 --> 01:57:34,007
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was really into it.

1718
01:57:34,027 --> 01:57:35,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, alright, I'll try this.

1719
01:57:35,529 --> 01:57:40,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, oh, I have to keep checking on these blueberries and shit every three hours or whatever.

1720
01:57:40,914 --> 01:57:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: And

1721
01:57:41,334 --> 01:58:04,058
[SPEAKER_05]: which is why I refuse to do the farming in WoW I can talk about this now because he's a thing of the past but he really liked the Farmville song which is so stupid because it's like the same five notes over and over again in different keys I remember joking about having a 70 minute soundtrack to Farmville and it was just those same five notes over and over Lord

1722
01:58:10,221 --> 01:58:11,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you staring at me like that, Loki?

1723
01:58:12,082 --> 01:58:13,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've never heard of that song.

1724
01:58:13,623 --> 01:58:14,964
[SPEAKER_13]: You've never heard the Farmville song?

1725
01:58:15,044 --> 01:58:15,324
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1726
01:58:15,464 --> 01:58:18,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Neither have I. I would like to not hear that song.

1727
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:22,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1728
01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:28,995
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't go all this time and then be all like, oh, I have never heard the song and then not expect somebody to not play the song.

1729
01:58:29,095 --> 01:58:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally expecting an awesome song.

1730
01:58:32,497 --> 01:58:33,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is like...

1731
01:58:36,483 --> 01:58:37,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, that's like all different now.

1732
01:58:37,684 --> 01:58:38,945
[SPEAKER_05]: When did they modernize it?

1733
01:58:39,385 --> 01:58:41,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be just these little tones that would play over and over again.

1734
01:58:43,168 --> 01:58:44,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, forget it.

1735
01:58:45,570 --> 01:58:46,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1736
01:58:46,971 --> 01:58:49,333
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fantastically non-generic at all.

1737
01:58:51,534 --> 01:58:53,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody must know the old Farmville songs.

1738
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:57,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm not the only one that played Farmville back in the day.

1739
01:58:58,059 --> 01:59:00,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's why I refuse to do the farming in WoW.

1740
01:59:01,882 --> 01:59:02,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Not gonna do it.

1741
01:59:02,742 --> 01:59:03,323
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not happening.

1742
01:59:04,043 --> 01:59:04,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1743
01:59:04,664 --> 01:59:06,185
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't give a damn about your scallions.

1744
01:59:07,168 --> 01:59:13,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ubisoft, I guess they were ones to swear off DRM in their games or something like that.

1745
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:15,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they patched it out for the games that had it.

1746
01:59:16,012 --> 01:59:18,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they apparently didn't do that all the way.

1747
01:59:18,274 --> 01:59:20,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Rocksmith just got released this week.

1748
01:59:21,415 --> 01:59:28,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And the PC version missed having the codes to activate the game inside the box.

1749
01:59:30,199 --> 01:59:30,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

1750
01:59:31,670 --> 01:59:33,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't play the game, no activation code.

1751
01:59:35,432 --> 01:59:37,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, people are like going, what the fuck?

1752
01:59:37,713 --> 01:59:49,219
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so they went to the Rocksmith forums and, you know, you have to go to a customer support site, fill out a form, attach a clear digital image of your receipt showing the store details and the product.

1753
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And your credit card number.

1754
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:53,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know...

1755
01:59:55,948 --> 02:00:09,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's just, it's kind of stupid though that they have this problem in the first place, that the serial wasn't part of the game manual or something like that, it wasn't printed somewhere in the game.

1756
02:00:09,725 --> 02:00:14,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey, you know, no one QA'd the fact that these games went out without codes in them.

1757
02:00:16,772 --> 02:00:17,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1758
02:00:32,582 --> 02:00:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many people would be pirating that game anyways, because you're talking about such a niche thing.

1759
02:00:39,427 --> 02:00:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about a game that requires an electric guitar, that requires a special connector, so even if you did pirate the game, you'd still have to go to the store to get that USB connector to plug your guitar into your computer.

1760
02:00:55,291 --> 02:01:13,461
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's just it's the PC title it's not even the console title it's that is like niche niche niche you know I mean yeah people are gonna some people probably will pirate it because they can but dude I mean come on I don't think that this is a type of game that necessarily needs that kind of DRM in there

1761
02:01:15,003 --> 02:01:15,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1762
02:01:15,383 --> 02:01:16,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little ridiculous.

1763
02:01:17,924 --> 02:01:22,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially when you make money in so many other ways with a game like this that has peripherals and everything.

1764
02:01:24,367 --> 02:01:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I think I'm with you.

1765
02:01:25,688 --> 02:01:27,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of useless to pirate this game.

1766
02:01:27,348 --> 02:01:29,789
[SPEAKER_05]: To play it with a keyboard is ridiculous.

1767
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:31,050
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't.

1768
02:01:33,792 --> 02:01:38,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ever tell a hacker they can't do something because you can remap the keyboard or whatever.

1769
02:01:39,057 --> 02:01:40,358
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, it's pointless.

1770
02:01:40,598 --> 02:01:41,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's absolutely pointless.

1771
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you have to have a guitar.

1772
02:01:43,301 --> 02:01:45,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so it's just... I don't know.

1773
02:01:45,763 --> 02:01:47,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of ridiculous that they would even have that.

1774
02:01:48,366 --> 02:01:48,546
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

1775
02:01:49,841 --> 02:02:03,249
[SPEAKER_04]: But they did, and of course, they said, we apologize for the inconvenience caused and will provide any affected customers with the Guitarcade Time Saver, which gives players instant access to all the Rocksmith minigames.

1776
02:02:03,730 --> 02:02:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ubisoft, I guess it's one of the forum mods.

1777
02:02:07,452 --> 02:02:14,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool, you get free DLC to unlock shit in your PC game to make up for the fact that they fucked it up.

1778
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:20,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, Assassin's Creed 3 is right around the corner, well, actually about a month away on PC.

1779
02:02:22,526 --> 02:02:23,066
[SPEAKER_04]: More fun.

1780
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:29,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, if you're one of those people, you know, word of mouth is really going to hurt them in this case, and that's really unfortunate.

1781
02:02:29,249 --> 02:02:33,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least this is the title that they fucked up on in Assassin's Creed 3 or Far Cry 3.

1782
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:36,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, you know, I think it's worse in this case.

1783
02:02:37,092 --> 02:02:41,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's worse when it's a niche title like this that really has relied on word of mouth, I think, to gain popularity.

1784
02:02:41,634 --> 02:02:47,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and you should be thanking these people left and right for buying your game on PC anyways, because once again, that's...

1785
02:02:48,097 --> 02:02:49,438
[SPEAKER_04]: This is such a niche game.

1786
02:02:49,538 --> 02:02:53,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see a lot of people on PC buying this game.

1787
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:56,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it just doesn't seem like something that they would purchase.

1788
02:02:56,642 --> 02:03:04,085
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess there's going to be people that make music on their PC and stuff, but they wouldn't necessarily be wanting to learn guitar or something.

1789
02:03:04,626 --> 02:03:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1790
02:03:05,046 --> 02:03:05,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

1791
02:03:06,994 --> 02:03:07,334
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird.

1792
02:03:07,454 --> 02:03:09,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ubisoft, come on.

1793
02:03:09,136 --> 02:03:11,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think that you would figure out this whole DRM thing.

1794
02:03:11,898 --> 02:03:13,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you've fucked this up before.

1795
02:03:13,879 --> 02:03:15,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver... What was it?

1796
02:03:16,441 --> 02:03:17,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Driver San Francisco.

1797
02:03:20,024 --> 02:03:20,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you not learned?

1798
02:03:22,126 --> 02:03:23,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the answer is yes.

1799
02:03:23,346 --> 02:03:23,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You have not learned.

1800
02:03:24,227 --> 02:03:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Very unfortunate.

1801
02:03:26,109 --> 02:03:34,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of the continued adventures of Ubisoft, Ubisoft actually filed a $1 million lawsuit yesterday against BEP Music, LLC.

1802
02:03:34,916 --> 02:03:36,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what BEP stands for?

1803
02:03:37,298 --> 02:03:39,540
[SPEAKER_05]: The Black Eyed Peas, the band.

1804
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:40,301
[SPEAKER_05]: You know them?

1805
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:42,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom Boom Pow, all that stuff.

1806
02:03:43,723 --> 02:03:47,166
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually wrote a song that uses the days of the week as lyrics.

1807
02:03:48,027 --> 02:03:51,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

1808
02:03:52,955 --> 02:03:54,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a top 40 song.

1809
02:03:56,257 --> 02:03:59,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if Friday can do it, we're going to make our song seven times better.

1810
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:02,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, the Black Eyed Peas experience.

1811
02:04:02,401 --> 02:04:05,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you know, but this was one of the dancing games that Ubisoft put out.

1812
02:04:06,184 --> 02:04:07,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was on the various consoles.

1813
02:04:07,965 --> 02:04:09,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably PC as well.

1814
02:04:09,226 --> 02:04:11,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just Wii and 360?

1815
02:04:11,227 --> 02:04:12,268
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't even do it for PlayStation 3?

1816
02:04:12,308 --> 02:04:13,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Or PC?

1817
02:04:13,309 --> 02:04:13,629
[SPEAKER_05]: None of that?

1818
02:04:13,669 --> 02:04:14,509
[SPEAKER_05]: No one gave a shit about PC.

1819
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:15,050
[SPEAKER_05]: It was all Kinect?

1820
02:04:15,110 --> 02:04:15,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well, whatever.

1821
02:04:16,111 --> 02:04:18,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, it was supposed to happen on iOS.

1822
02:04:18,812 --> 02:04:19,133
[SPEAKER_05]: iOS.

1823
02:04:19,873 --> 02:04:45,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But apparently, BEP breached the company's contract The contract stated that the band agreed to approve or disprove the iOS version within 10 business days of request However, the music company failed to acknowledge requests for approval despite repeated attempts Ubisoft claims they spent $233,000 developing the iOS game That's how much it costs to develop a game like this, huh?

1824
02:04:45,273 --> 02:04:46,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just curious

1825
02:04:47,591 --> 02:04:48,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1826
02:05:08,132 --> 02:05:08,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1827
02:05:08,753 --> 02:05:15,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe the band felt burned by the other games and didn't want to do it, or maybe they just felt they were too good for it.

1828
02:05:15,543 --> 02:05:15,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1829
02:05:15,864 --> 02:05:16,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it was that bad.

1830
02:05:16,865 --> 02:05:20,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, this year we have the hip-hop dance experience.

1831
02:05:20,891 --> 02:05:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is what it is, type of thing.

1832
02:05:23,314 --> 02:05:23,475
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1833
02:05:24,878 --> 02:05:25,178
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1834
02:05:54,171 --> 02:05:55,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, that.

1835
02:05:56,952 --> 02:06:01,494
[SPEAKER_15]: How about some more Wii U stuff?

1836
02:06:02,455 --> 02:06:13,660
[SPEAKER_15]: There's going to be a Square Enix game that's done by the developer that's porting Mass Effect 3 to the Wii U. It says it's a AAA Square Enix port, but who knows what it is?

1837
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:20,483
[SPEAKER_15]: It was actually listed on a LinkedIn page, which has since been changed.

1838
02:06:22,538 --> 02:06:23,619
[SPEAKER_15]: So, who knows?

1839
02:06:23,799 --> 02:06:25,400
[SPEAKER_15]: But it will be a Squeenix game.

1840
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomb Raider.

1841
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, probably.

1842
02:06:27,521 --> 02:06:33,864
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a... I don't care, because I'm not getting a Wii U. You think so, huh?

1843
02:06:34,244 --> 02:06:38,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Hitman's going to be coming out, because they'd be kind of late for it if they just started development on it.

1844
02:06:39,347 --> 02:06:41,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Tomb Raider makes sense, because it's coming out about a year from now.

1845
02:06:42,409 --> 02:06:44,970
[SPEAKER_15]: They also mentioned a possibility of a Deus Ex.

1846
02:06:47,120 --> 02:07:15,332
[SPEAKER_04]: once again that would be really delayed I mean Deus Ex came out last year if Arkham Asylum that's a cash in on the beginning but no one's going to want to play a game that came out three years ago that just has some different controls in it well Crystal Dynamics actually already denied Tomb Raider saying that it would have to be completely redesigned so it would be a much later released game it could still be Deadline and Riptide because I think they're publishing for that South Peak game

1847
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, ready for my tinfoil hat?

1848
02:07:18,361 --> 02:07:21,802
[SPEAKER_05]: What about, I know this is going to be crazy talk, what about Final Fantasy XIV?

1849
02:07:25,203 --> 02:07:26,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the new one could be good.

1850
02:07:27,404 --> 02:07:27,984
[SPEAKER_05]: We still don't know.

1851
02:07:28,084 --> 02:07:29,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, monkeys could fly out of my butt.

1852
02:07:29,845 --> 02:07:30,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

1853
02:07:31,545 --> 02:07:32,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything's possible, right?

1854
02:07:33,066 --> 02:07:37,787
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again though, we're talking about a system that can't fucking handle Call of Duty Elite.

1855
02:07:37,927 --> 02:07:39,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 redo.

1856
02:07:39,908 --> 02:07:42,929
[SPEAKER_13]: If I start farting primates, then I'll believe it.

1857
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:44,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1858
02:07:46,405 --> 02:07:50,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, though, you were talking about a game that's probably going to be coming out next holiday.

1859
02:07:52,089 --> 02:07:54,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be very well a title they haven't announced yet.

1860
02:07:54,551 --> 02:08:00,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's... Let's see, I'm trying to think of... I mean, they have Tomb Raider.

1861
02:08:00,794 --> 02:08:02,055
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other Square Enix titles.

1862
02:08:02,095 --> 02:08:03,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be anything.

1863
02:08:03,476 --> 02:08:04,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Just use your imagination.

1864
02:08:04,877 --> 02:08:05,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Chocobo Racing 2!

1865
02:08:06,378 --> 02:08:06,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

1866
02:08:06,958 --> 02:08:08,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that'd be awesome.

1867
02:08:08,259 --> 02:08:09,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

1868
02:08:09,898 --> 02:08:11,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get a Wii U if there's Chocobo Racing.

1869
02:08:11,319 --> 02:08:12,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it happen.

1870
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:12,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

1871
02:08:12,860 --> 02:08:15,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

1872
02:08:18,303 --> 02:08:18,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1873
02:08:19,223 --> 02:08:21,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1874
02:08:22,385 --> 02:08:31,390
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk a lot about Kickstarter and there's always a conspiracy theory or not even conspiracy theory but the reality that some of these projects may not turn out well.

1875
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:41,794
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of happened to be the case of one of the kickstarted projects that actually did get funded is a turn-based haunted house game called Haunts.

1876
02:08:42,674 --> 02:08:45,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was being done by a company called Mob Rules Games.

1877
02:08:47,379 --> 02:09:01,809
[SPEAKER_04]: and um you know they raised um i forget what it was it was like maybe twenty thousand dollars and uh the problem is though that you know that it's been a few months or whatever um all of his programmers quit

1878
02:09:03,932 --> 02:09:08,637
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently all the money has been spent because $20,000 is not a whole lot.

1879
02:09:09,178 --> 02:09:12,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least it seems like kind of an olive branch from the developer.

1880
02:09:13,002 --> 02:09:20,629
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he's still going to continue working on the game and that if there's anybody that's seeking a refund, he will refund them out of his own pocket.

1881
02:09:21,190 --> 02:09:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool at least.

1882
02:09:24,173 --> 02:09:26,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And things happen, I guess, but at least he's still moving on.

1883
02:09:27,219 --> 02:09:27,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1884
02:09:44,034 --> 02:09:48,037
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of people actually have a product that they want to put out and stuff.

1885
02:09:49,838 --> 02:09:51,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, you just got to do your research.

1886
02:09:53,701 --> 02:10:11,072
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, that guy that wanted one million for an MMORPG and had no idea of what... Just like it was such a generic, I want to make an MMO that's going to be bigger than WoW and it's got things and races and items.

1887
02:10:11,472 --> 02:10:13,554
[SPEAKER_04]: If you pledge this much, you're going to get a special item.

1888
02:10:13,954 --> 02:10:37,351
[SPEAKER_04]: and I own a baseball or I used to play baseball so I know I can do this oh wait sorry no no no wrong case sorry but no you just have to do the research and they obviously kickstart stuff that you know there's a lot of developers that have pedigrees in developing games and stuff like that they're putting stuff on kickstarter you just have to you know be aware of what you're kickstarting I mean some of these companies like the one I you know like I said the rhythm destruction game

1889
02:10:37,711 --> 02:10:40,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like some people that, you know, some guys that are making a game.

1890
02:10:41,492 --> 02:10:44,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't know if that's going to be done, but they weren't asking for much money.

1891
02:10:45,193 --> 02:10:47,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, they got the game out.

1892
02:10:47,473 --> 02:10:50,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, you can't just go, oh, they're all going to fail.

1893
02:10:50,974 --> 02:10:52,174
[SPEAKER_04]: But just keeping that in mind.

1894
02:10:52,975 --> 02:10:58,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, even if you do pledge money to Kickstarter, you always have up until that close date to change your mind.

1895
02:10:58,896 --> 02:11:00,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done that before with stuff.

1896
02:11:00,336 --> 02:11:02,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, eh, I don't want to kickstart this.

1897
02:11:02,857 --> 02:11:03,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can take your money out.

1898
02:11:03,757 --> 02:11:04,677
[SPEAKER_04]: You just pledge nothing.

1899
02:11:05,238 --> 02:11:06,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's...

1900
02:11:08,922 --> 02:11:09,302
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1901
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:37,242
[SPEAKER_05]: He is now taking a position at KO University.

1902
02:11:37,302 --> 02:11:38,942
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a project professor.

1903
02:11:39,343 --> 02:11:44,686
[SPEAKER_05]: He will remain at Q as a spokesperson, but it sounds like this is kind of his new path here now.

1904
02:11:46,727 --> 02:11:57,973
[SPEAKER_05]: KO did make an announcement about this and noted that his position in the Graduate School of Media Design will allow him to continue to produce games and further expand his expertise in the field of media design and innovative content production.

1905
02:11:58,513 --> 02:11:59,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the stuff he's done for music games

1906
02:12:18,732 --> 02:12:19,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft does make a good point.

1907
02:12:21,193 --> 02:12:23,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Mizuguchi Sensei is what we have to call him from now on.

1908
02:12:24,915 --> 02:12:25,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point, good point.

1909
02:12:26,636 --> 02:12:29,797
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, good luck to him in the new career.

1910
02:12:29,857 --> 02:12:36,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And at least, you know, as much as we might be sad that, you know, he'll have less time for games, although they're staying, he'll still do games.

1911
02:12:38,901 --> 02:12:40,142
[SPEAKER_05]: At least he'll be... He'll be grading papers.

1912
02:12:40,382 --> 02:12:42,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he'll be influencing more people.

1913
02:12:42,403 --> 02:12:42,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.

1914
02:12:42,803 --> 02:12:42,983
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll be...

1915
02:12:43,283 --> 02:12:45,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Noob, noob, noob, win.

1916
02:12:45,505 --> 02:12:47,707
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's anything like it is here, the TA's great.

1917
02:12:47,727 --> 02:12:48,267
[SPEAKER_05]: All papers.

1918
02:12:48,287 --> 02:12:48,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You and I both know that.

1919
02:12:49,268 --> 02:12:49,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1920
02:12:50,989 --> 02:12:51,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

1921
02:12:53,371 --> 02:12:54,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Popcorn's good.

1922
02:12:54,372 --> 02:12:55,192
[SPEAKER_05]: You should eat popcorn.

1923
02:12:55,513 --> 02:12:56,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to the mailbag.

1924
02:12:56,313 --> 02:12:56,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm eating yours.

1925
02:12:58,395 --> 02:12:59,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Every week you guys send us emails.

1926
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:03,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com We actually got some emails this week, right?

1927
02:13:04,179 --> 02:13:04,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Kinda.

1928
02:13:05,961 --> 02:13:10,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com DarkSakura's gonna dive into the mailbag head first and pull out some emails.

1929
02:13:10,564 --> 02:13:11,145
[SPEAKER_05]: She thinks, hey!

1930
02:13:12,335 --> 02:13:13,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna read this email.

1931
02:13:14,595 --> 02:13:16,016
[SPEAKER_15]: This one's long, so I'm gonna read it first.

1932
02:13:18,336 --> 02:13:24,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear OLR, I just wanted to chime in with my thoughts on a recent game I completed, that game being Final Fantasy XIII-2.

1933
02:13:24,858 --> 02:13:28,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Originally, I played the demo when it was released on the PS3, and I wasn't drawn into the game at all.

1934
02:13:29,819 --> 02:13:36,120
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't really explain anything that was going on story-wise, and it seemed to make the game out to be a Final Fantasy filler.

1935
02:13:40,549 --> 02:13:43,370
[SPEAKER_15]: I also read some reviews that spun the game in a negative light.

1936
02:13:44,030 --> 02:13:50,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So just saying that the music in the game was terrible and that one reviewer in particular had to turn off the sound for a final boss fight.

1937
02:13:51,332 --> 02:13:55,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Boy was I surprised when I picked up the game at Best Buy Summer Sale and finally put it in my system.

1938
02:13:56,013 --> 02:14:02,275
[SPEAKER_15]: The story turned out to be really interesting with time travel being an interesting mechanic as a method to traveling to different areas.

1939
02:14:03,275 --> 02:14:05,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, if you have it, you need to play this game to the end.

1940
02:14:07,563 --> 02:14:10,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played to the end, but I've played a really good chunk of it.

1941
02:14:10,426 --> 02:14:11,987
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a good game.

1942
02:14:12,087 --> 02:14:13,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I do need to beat it.

1943
02:14:13,288 --> 02:14:14,550
[SPEAKER_15]: That brings me to a question for the hosts.

1944
02:14:15,210 --> 02:14:21,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you ever played a game demo that you ended up not liking at all, only to play the full game later on and absolutely love it?

1945
02:14:21,937 --> 02:14:25,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy VIII, except I started hating it again, but I beat it.

1946
02:14:28,643 --> 02:14:31,626
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought Parappa was kind of stupid at first, and then I ended up loving it.

1947
02:14:34,042 --> 02:14:34,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendogs

1948
02:14:59,457 --> 02:15:01,060
[SPEAKER_05]: First time I played it, I wasn't that into it.

1949
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:02,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it at a party.

1950
02:15:02,082 --> 02:15:03,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was the best thing ever.

1951
02:15:04,146 --> 02:15:07,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that was really a demo, but that's the best answer I got.

1952
02:15:09,292 --> 02:15:19,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I've found that after hearing from multiple friends of how much they dislike Final Fantasy XIII, yes, the first game, then their impressions rub off on me, making me skeptical if I would even like the sequel.

1953
02:15:21,218 --> 02:15:22,579
[SPEAKER_15]: If I would have liked the sequel, sorry.

1954
02:15:23,699 --> 02:15:25,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Thinking back on it, however, I really love XIII.

1955
02:15:26,501 --> 02:15:31,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, the battle system wasn't exactly my favorite, but it was far from enough to make the game not enjoyable.

1956
02:15:33,419 --> 02:15:34,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Now for a final question.

1957
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:42,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Has a popular opinion about a game that you played had an impact on how you felt about it, or do you not let what people say affect your gaming experience?

1958
02:15:43,342 --> 02:15:44,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly try not to let what people say.

1959
02:15:46,163 --> 02:15:53,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I try not to, but if I really dislike a game and I go read that the popular opinion's very good, I do kind of go, did I miss something?

1960
02:15:54,446 --> 02:15:55,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I not understand something?

1961
02:15:57,127 --> 02:15:58,247
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't happen very often.

1962
02:16:00,327 --> 02:16:01,467
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I have to say for now.

1963
02:16:01,507 --> 02:16:02,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for reading, Osfer.

1964
02:16:03,288 --> 02:16:03,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to cry again.

1965
02:16:04,849 --> 02:16:05,189
[SPEAKER_15]: P.S.

1966
02:16:05,289 --> 02:16:07,389
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really sad to hear about Jamie's dear cat, Shermie.

1967
02:16:08,270 --> 02:16:10,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure she led an awesome life with her owners and will be missed.

1968
02:16:11,031 --> 02:16:11,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Rest in peace, hearts.

1969
02:16:13,291 --> 02:16:15,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, she led an awesomely lazy life.

1970
02:16:16,252 --> 02:16:17,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what a lot of listeners are thinking right now.

1971
02:16:19,639 --> 02:16:20,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I miss my baby.

1972
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:21,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1973
02:16:22,460 --> 02:16:23,781
[SPEAKER_15]: This is from Tybon.

1974
02:16:24,781 --> 02:16:29,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Tybon here emailed you a few years ago, and I thought I'd report back now what we're doing here in the heart of Africa.

1975
02:16:30,644 --> 02:16:35,246
[SPEAKER_15]: My Xbox was red-ringed a while ago, so it's been all PlayStation here at the household.

1976
02:16:35,666 --> 02:16:37,407
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very hard finding new consoles here.

1977
02:16:37,907 --> 02:16:40,148
[SPEAKER_15]: All Borderlands and Skyrim marathons recently for me.

1978
02:16:40,228 --> 02:16:41,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Hope you're all doing well.

1979
02:16:41,208 --> 02:16:45,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Tybon, this message is brought to you by Dirt Garden, home of the never-ending empty plates.

1980
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:49,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we do research the first time to see if this was like a legit thing or if it was a troll?

1981
02:16:49,534 --> 02:16:51,997
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we found out, yeah, this guy's like legit there.

1982
02:16:52,037 --> 02:16:53,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he send a picture or something?

1983
02:16:53,118 --> 02:16:53,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1984
02:16:53,899 --> 02:16:54,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1985
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:55,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, thank you for checking in, sir.

1986
02:16:56,461 --> 02:16:57,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for still listening even after.

1987
02:16:58,383 --> 02:16:59,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Skeptical.

1988
02:16:59,424 --> 02:17:01,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time I read your email, I think of that song.

1989
02:17:01,967 --> 02:17:03,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the rains in Africa.

1990
02:17:04,389 --> 02:17:04,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Toto.

1991
02:17:04,970 --> 02:17:05,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Toto.

1992
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:05,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1993
02:17:05,670 --> 02:17:06,571
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what's that song?

1994
02:17:06,591 --> 02:17:06,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1995
02:17:09,318 --> 02:17:11,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I've heard a really good cover of it at a concert.

1996
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:12,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you?

1997
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:15,642
[SPEAKER_15]: By a group, a men's acapella group called Straight No Chaser.

1998
02:17:18,404 --> 02:17:19,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it something local?

1999
02:17:19,784 --> 02:17:19,964
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2000
02:17:20,785 --> 02:17:22,186
[SPEAKER_15]: They're kind of the big thing.

2001
02:17:22,246 --> 02:17:28,510
[SPEAKER_15]: They do tours and a lot of them were, I think, Broadway performers and various singers and other things.

2002
02:17:30,051 --> 02:17:33,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, look up the Straight No Chaser version because it's really, really good.

2003
02:17:34,373 --> 02:17:34,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2004
02:17:34,733 --> 02:17:35,194
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to...

2005
02:17:36,894 --> 02:17:39,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to just make sure our listeners... Oh, God.

2006
02:17:41,195 --> 02:17:41,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to shame myself.

2007
02:17:41,955 --> 02:17:43,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Ads are going to be the death of me.

2008
02:17:44,396 --> 02:17:45,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terrible radio.

2009
02:17:46,777 --> 02:17:52,238
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think one of these days I'm going to learn to load this stuff in advance.

2010
02:17:53,719 --> 02:17:55,059
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, I know all the lyrics to this song.

2011
02:17:55,819 --> 02:17:56,159
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

2012
02:17:56,859 --> 02:17:57,359
[SPEAKER_13]: You were right there.

2013
02:17:57,920 --> 02:17:58,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it?

2014
02:17:58,540 --> 02:17:58,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2015
02:17:59,700 --> 02:17:59,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

2016
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:00,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there it is.

2017
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:00,760
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

2018
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:01,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

2019
02:18:01,101 --> 02:18:01,221
[SPEAKER_05]: That's...

2020
02:18:13,355 --> 02:18:15,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I know this one by his harmony.

2021
02:18:21,777 --> 02:18:22,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that song in Rock Band?

2022
02:18:23,537 --> 02:18:24,178
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it should be.

2023
02:18:24,278 --> 02:18:24,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be.

2024
02:18:25,738 --> 02:18:26,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Harmonix.

2025
02:18:29,239 --> 02:18:29,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Last email.

2026
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:31,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Greetings, OLR.

2027
02:18:31,719 --> 02:18:33,200
[SPEAKER_15]: It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

2028
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:36,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's an interesting dilemma I'm in.

2029
02:18:37,361 --> 02:18:38,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, noes.

2030
02:18:38,421 --> 02:18:38,841
[SPEAKER_05]: A dilemma.

2031
02:18:39,884 --> 02:18:43,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm interested in a new PC game that's just come out on Steam, XCOM.

2032
02:18:44,787 --> 02:18:47,129
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the demo, but I don't think it's worth 50 bucks.

2033
02:18:47,629 --> 02:18:51,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can either get it by other means or wait for the Christmas sale or not get it at all.

2034
02:18:52,232 --> 02:18:58,136
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is, if I wait for all PC games to go on sale on Steam, will publishers stop making PC games because of the lack of release sales?

2035
02:18:58,757 --> 02:19:01,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Or will they notice if people like me will wait for those games to go on sale?

2036
02:19:03,757 --> 02:19:09,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to send the publishers a message that their games are too expensive, but I still want to support the game makers.

2037
02:19:09,782 --> 02:19:13,444
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want the lack of release sales to deter them from making the games to begin with.

2038
02:19:13,524 --> 02:19:16,386
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle?

2039
02:19:16,527 --> 02:19:17,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a reality check.

2040
02:19:18,388 --> 02:19:22,751
[SPEAKER_05]: The game won't be $9.99 when the Christmas sale comes around.

2041
02:19:22,891 --> 02:19:25,593
[SPEAKER_05]: The game will be like, what is it, $60 now?

2042
02:19:26,474 --> 02:19:28,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be like $30.

2043
02:19:28,455 --> 02:19:28,535
[SPEAKER_05]: $30 or $35.

2044
02:19:28,575 --> 02:19:33,079
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like best case scenario because I don't even think Skyrim went that low that fast.

2045
02:19:34,299 --> 02:19:44,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, don't assume that the game... Now, I certainly am not going to encourage you to go to more nefarious means because then you certainly are sending the wrong message to the publisher.

2046
02:19:44,202 --> 02:19:51,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, if you do that, I don't think you'd get to do the online play and all that stuff, which I think is supposed to be... I used to love the old XCOM games.

2047
02:19:51,984 --> 02:19:53,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I really need to look into this new one.

2048
02:19:53,744 --> 02:19:55,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, you know, I've been playing all this other crap.

2049
02:19:55,805 --> 02:19:55,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

2050
02:19:56,533 --> 02:19:58,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're still gonna make their money.

2051
02:19:58,715 --> 02:19:58,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2052
02:20:00,137 --> 02:20:04,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's certainly better that you wait for the holiday sale than pirate it.

2053
02:20:04,542 --> 02:20:06,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's certainly the better of the two options.

2054
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:12,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sending the wrong message by waiting?

2055
02:20:12,652 --> 02:20:14,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to actually say not necessarily.

2056
02:20:14,953 --> 02:20:22,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're not the gamer that was pre-ordering this, eager about this the first day, had to have your hands on it right away.

2057
02:20:22,477 --> 02:20:24,338
[SPEAKER_05]: There were other people that filled that niche for you.

2058
02:20:24,758 --> 02:20:25,758
[SPEAKER_05]: You are on the fence.

2059
02:20:26,339 --> 02:20:33,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the company would rather have you at least tilt over and get the game eventually a little cheaper than not pay anything for it at all.

2060
02:20:34,763 --> 02:20:41,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan Shadow in chat at live.vognetwork.com says by the way XCOM is addicting and TigerClaw says the new XCOM is awesome.

2061
02:20:42,027 --> 02:20:44,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not helping you being able to resist buying it right now.

2062
02:20:44,988 --> 02:20:45,988
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm really curious.

2063
02:20:46,308 --> 02:20:51,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of want to see if one of my friends has it and like go over to their house and watch them play and then see if I want to get it.

2064
02:20:52,511 --> 02:20:52,891
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2065
02:20:54,112 --> 02:20:58,934
[SPEAKER_05]: This is 200Matt in our chat at live.vognetwork.com though warns it's hard from what I've been seeing.

2066
02:20:58,954 --> 02:21:00,895
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2067
02:21:01,575 --> 02:21:02,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more emails tonight?

2068
02:21:03,754 --> 02:21:04,335
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

2069
02:21:04,756 --> 02:21:07,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Then let's get to the FUs of the week, because damn, y'all angry.

2070
02:21:24,327 --> 02:21:42,232
[SPEAKER_15]: FU to Origin slash EA and or Bioware if Bioware is involved in this for the patch that just came out for Mass Effect 3 that's not letting me and other people connect to the game to actually play it and also not verifying my DLC so I can't play the game that I paid money for.

2071
02:21:42,652 --> 02:21:42,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Sue.

2072
02:21:44,673 --> 02:21:48,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh no, I've already put the three magic words on EA's help forum.

2073
02:21:48,894 --> 02:21:49,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Better Business Bureau.

2074
02:21:51,129 --> 02:21:55,811
[SPEAKER_15]: I've gotten two responses already from other people in the community, so maybe it'll greenlight it, you know?

2075
02:21:59,272 --> 02:22:00,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavy to my cold.

2076
02:22:01,953 --> 02:22:02,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all stuffed up.

2077
02:22:05,075 --> 02:22:07,896
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you get when you have a toddler in preschool?

2078
02:22:08,874 --> 02:22:15,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't have a toddler in preschool or whatever, but I do have a boyfriend and he's sick, so F you to the fact that he's sick.

2079
02:22:16,838 --> 02:22:17,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me sick, anybody.

2080
02:22:17,919 --> 02:22:22,781
[SPEAKER_05]: He can't help it, but I'm just saying, you know, I feel like Dead Man Walking right now.

2081
02:22:24,763 --> 02:22:25,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm going to get sick.

2082
02:22:26,984 --> 02:22:31,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll have to try and enjoy the time off work while I'm sitting here on the couch with a fever.

2083
02:22:31,246 --> 02:22:33,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, lucky for you, you can take time off of work.

2084
02:22:33,907 --> 02:22:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: If I take time off of work, I'd probably have to watch Josh.

2085
02:22:37,088 --> 02:22:39,149
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really time off of work.

2086
02:22:39,849 --> 02:22:40,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, here's the other perk.

2087
02:22:41,189 --> 02:22:46,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have a cold, I'm obviously snoring because I have to breathe through my mouth and stuff.

2088
02:22:47,151 --> 02:22:47,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to sleep on the couch.

2089
02:22:48,052 --> 02:22:49,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been sleeping on the couch for the last two weeks.

2090
02:22:51,133 --> 02:22:55,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means I'll have to tend to the baby all night long when he loses his bank and cries.

2091
02:22:56,294 --> 02:22:57,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm up about once every hour.

2092
02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:01,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry, in a few more years, he'll be able to take care of himself.

2093
02:23:02,061 --> 02:23:02,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

2094
02:23:02,321 --> 02:23:02,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

2095
02:23:02,782 --> 02:23:04,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he can take care of himself now.

2096
02:23:04,082 --> 02:23:06,483
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just too tired to find his bink that's right next to his head.

2097
02:23:06,883 --> 02:23:08,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I want my bink.

2098
02:23:08,764 --> 02:23:10,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's under my head.

2099
02:23:10,185 --> 02:23:12,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, why don't you get it yourself?

2100
02:23:12,986 --> 02:23:17,068
[SPEAKER_05]: TigerClaw in our chatroom is reporting that the Mass Effect 3 data pad hasn't been working for weeks.

2101
02:23:17,688 --> 02:23:18,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine's worked.

2102
02:23:18,589 --> 02:23:18,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2103
02:23:19,029 --> 02:23:20,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at 100% right now.

2104
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:20,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

2105
02:23:20,790 --> 02:23:21,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then there you go.

2106
02:23:22,331 --> 02:23:23,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just you, TigerClaw.

2107
02:23:23,391 --> 02:23:23,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

2108
02:23:24,031 --> 02:23:25,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Uninstall, reinstall.

2109
02:23:26,038 --> 02:23:53,388
[SPEAKER_15]: that's actually what I did is I uninstalled and reinstalled Mass Effect 3 and tried to play it and what happened is that it gave me the same error before so I went on offline mode and it let me go into the single player game and then I later on was able to get into multiplayer but it since hasn't allowed me to do any of it again TigerClaw in chat says I've been playing XCOM on my Twitch TV recently

2110
02:23:54,795 --> 02:23:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of those things I'm surprised I'm not into right now is streaming video games.

2111
02:23:58,017 --> 02:23:58,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'd have fun.

2112
02:23:58,998 --> 02:24:01,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't you guys like to see me play Mass Effect 3 online?

2113
02:24:02,260 --> 02:24:02,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't that be fun?

2114
02:24:03,780 --> 02:24:07,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Tiger Claw, saying the galaxy at war won't load.

2115
02:24:08,223 --> 02:24:09,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

2116
02:24:10,504 --> 02:24:19,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's actually, it was saying that it wasn't for me, so let me play everything, but now it's actually saying cannot log into servers or whatever.

2117
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:25,554
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can hear it, I'm actually in the thing right now.

2118
02:24:27,797 --> 02:24:29,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's move on.

2119
02:24:29,339 --> 02:24:32,084
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple more news stories for you guys and then Skype line and Twitter topic.

2120
02:24:34,412 --> 02:24:38,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so let's talk about Minecraft.

2121
02:24:38,894 --> 02:24:42,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Minecraft's got a pretty awesome update coming out next week.

2122
02:24:42,717 --> 02:24:42,096
1.4!

2123
02:24:42,937 --> 02:24:45,518
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a pretty scary update.

2124
02:24:46,059 --> 02:24:47,780
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course it's sort of Halloween themed.

2125
02:24:47,800 --> 02:24:50,521
[SPEAKER_04]: They did one a couple years ago that was also Halloween themed.

2126
02:24:51,122 --> 02:24:53,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're adding a lot of cool shit into the game.

2127
02:24:53,903 --> 02:24:56,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So first, let's talk a little bit about what they're adding.

2128
02:24:57,645 --> 02:25:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I'm very excited about is command blocks.

2129
02:25:00,487 --> 02:25:09,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And what the command blocks allow you to do is actually issue some of the commands from the admin panel in-game.

2130
02:25:09,112 --> 02:25:15,036
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have a block set up, for example, to have a certain area set to peaceful.

2131
02:25:15,296 --> 02:25:18,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So no mobs spawn in a certain radius or something like that.

2132
02:25:18,317 --> 02:25:19,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can have...

2133
02:25:19,498 --> 02:25:20,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2134
02:25:39,075 --> 02:25:41,217
[SPEAKER_04]: They're updating all the different sounds in the game.

2135
02:25:41,537 --> 02:25:50,664
[SPEAKER_04]: They're adding sounds for placing different blocks, for walking on those blocks, sounds for the enemies, all sorts of cool stuff like that.

2136
02:25:51,064 --> 02:25:52,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Portals are changing a little bit.

2137
02:25:53,486 --> 02:25:56,529
[SPEAKER_04]: The nether portals in creative mode, you're going to be able to instantly go through them.

2138
02:25:57,169 --> 02:26:01,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Adventure mode, they're allowing you to break blocks now and you can also place blocks.

2139
02:26:02,614 --> 02:26:04,396
[SPEAKER_04]: They're changing how they're doing the breeding stuff.

2140
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:13,629
[SPEAKER_04]: They're adding different characters into the game, including bats, witches, and what was it?

2141
02:26:13,729 --> 02:26:14,250
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the...

2142
02:26:18,526 --> 02:26:21,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Wither and Wither Skeletons Creepers

2143
02:26:35,075 --> 02:26:41,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can toggle how long it takes for them to explode and their explosion radius, which is pretty cool.

2144
02:26:41,336 --> 02:26:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And then new blocks.

2145
02:26:42,797 --> 02:26:50,418
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got, besides those command blocks, beacons, which will kind of create that Luxor pyramid beam into the sky thing.

2146
02:26:50,478 --> 02:26:52,018
[SPEAKER_04]: It can give you different buffs.

2147
02:26:52,498 --> 02:26:55,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Anvils to repair armor and tools.

2148
02:26:56,499 --> 02:26:57,739
[SPEAKER_04]: The mob spawners, as I mentioned.

2149
02:26:57,819 --> 02:27:00,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Flower pots, so you can put, you know...

2150
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:06,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Saplings, Mushrooms, Pots, Cobblestone Walls, Wooden Logs, Stairs, Item Frames, Heads, Trap Doors, Wooden Buttons,

2151
02:27:26,623 --> 02:27:29,525
[SPEAKER_04]: and Potatoes, Carrots, Carrots on a Stick for riding pigs.

2152
02:27:29,705 --> 02:27:31,727
[SPEAKER_04]: You can ride pigs and control where they go now.

2153
02:27:32,448 --> 02:27:32,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2154
02:27:32,868 --> 02:27:35,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to have, I'm going to set up a pig cart racing track.

2155
02:27:35,390 --> 02:27:38,953
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be pretty awesome.

2156
02:27:38,973 --> 02:27:42,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Different potions including night vision and visibility potions.

2157
02:27:42,857 --> 02:27:48,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Maps now you can spawn them or you can craft them so they zoom out and create larger maps.

2158
02:27:49,062 --> 02:27:52,125
[SPEAKER_04]: And leather armor can be dyed so you can wear pink armor if you want to.

2159
02:27:53,465 --> 02:28:01,228
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course the new villain or boss character in the game, the Wither, can be spawned too.

2160
02:28:01,309 --> 02:28:16,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I'm kind of scared to spawn that because you can actually create it with Soul Sand and Wither Skeleton Skulls but he will attack mobs and players and he's got explosive heads that will actually blow up everything including Obsidian.

2161
02:28:17,595 --> 02:28:17,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.

2162
02:28:18,276 --> 02:28:20,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'll have to make a rule.

2163
02:28:20,357 --> 02:28:21,398
[SPEAKER_04]: No spawning the wither.

2164
02:28:22,579 --> 02:28:26,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I just sort of blanked out and had no idea what he was talking about.

2165
02:28:26,862 --> 02:28:28,404
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like when you talk about Mass Effect.

2166
02:28:29,184 --> 02:28:30,165
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I'm talking about.

2167
02:28:30,565 --> 02:28:31,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I at least hear you.

2168
02:28:31,166 --> 02:28:32,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, bats are going to be cool.

2169
02:28:32,147 --> 02:28:33,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those will...

2170
02:28:34,204 --> 02:28:34,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

2171
02:28:56,089 --> 02:29:17,506
[SPEAKER_05]: and uh yeah very cool all right well one more story for you guys tonight and this is uh a bit of a sad thing uh we did lose somebody in the gaming industry this week and it was um a UK based individual Mike Singleton unfortunately passed away this week at the age of 61 he died of natural causes and this was after a year-long battle with jaw cancer

2172
02:29:18,606 --> 02:29:23,828
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not know the name, but you might know some of his contributions, including Space Ace on the Commodore VIC-20.

2173
02:29:24,248 --> 02:29:26,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's to be confused with the arcade title.

2174
02:29:27,130 --> 02:29:29,110
[SPEAKER_05]: War in Middle Earth for the ZX Spectrum.

2175
02:29:29,411 --> 02:29:32,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Midwinter and Midwinter 2 for the Atari ST, Amiga, and PC.

2176
02:29:32,592 --> 02:29:38,614
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the most recent things he was involved with, Grid, for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

2177
02:29:39,055 --> 02:29:40,895
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mike Singleton, again, passed away at 61.

2178
02:29:42,396 --> 02:29:46,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, a tip of the glass here, a toast to Absinthe Friends.

2179
02:29:47,938 --> 02:29:48,238
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2180
02:29:49,398 --> 02:29:52,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

2181
02:29:52,739 --> 02:29:56,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Skype line is now open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2182
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:59,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2183
02:29:59,821 --> 02:30:04,062
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to give us a call, again, the Skype line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2184
02:30:04,422 --> 02:30:06,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2185
02:30:07,102 --> 02:30:08,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to go grab the iPad.

2186
02:30:08,563 --> 02:30:09,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

2187
02:30:11,444 --> 02:30:12,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some small stuff.

2188
02:30:13,145 --> 02:30:20,090
[SPEAKER_04]: They were talking about having a change to the Xbox Live, I guess, service.

2189
02:30:20,110 --> 02:30:27,075
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to do Xbox Live migration to anyone, I guess, and it's going to be automated soon.

2190
02:30:27,395 --> 02:30:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And what migration means is that if, for example, I'm in North America and I move to Europe, you can change your account so that it will, you know,

2191
02:30:39,847 --> 02:30:41,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Show the European Marketplace.

2192
02:30:41,869 --> 02:30:44,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Which would be completely useless if you brought your system.

2193
02:30:44,350 --> 02:30:48,173
[SPEAKER_04]: But for whatever reason, if you want to change regions or something like that, then you can do that.

2194
02:30:48,253 --> 02:30:50,635
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're going to allow you to do that.

2195
02:30:50,855 --> 02:30:52,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me quickly go to the phones because we do have a call.

2196
02:30:52,816 --> 02:30:53,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2197
02:30:53,797 --> 02:30:54,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2198
02:30:54,718 --> 02:30:55,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Shane.

2199
02:30:55,538 --> 02:30:56,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane.

2200
02:30:56,139 --> 02:30:56,739
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, Shane?

2201
02:30:57,360 --> 02:30:59,701
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two things I would like to talk about tonight.

2202
02:30:59,841 --> 02:31:00,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.

2203
02:31:02,143 --> 02:31:04,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill Book of Memories is a piece of garbage.

2204
02:31:05,406 --> 02:31:06,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

2205
02:31:06,546 --> 02:31:08,668
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably would have used another word, but I know you don't swear.

2206
02:31:09,659 --> 02:31:14,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's also a piece of crap or a piece of... Well, I've already used two words, so it's fine.

2207
02:31:15,085 --> 02:31:16,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it so terrible?

2208
02:31:16,066 --> 02:31:17,888
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like the biggest Silent Hill fan I know.

2209
02:31:18,516 --> 02:31:20,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Not lately, because they've all been crap games.

2210
02:31:21,257 --> 02:31:25,398
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, this weekend I watched Downpour, because I haven't played it yet, and that was pretty crap too.

2211
02:31:27,818 --> 02:31:33,459
[SPEAKER_03]: My boyfriend picked up the main game, and I forced him to return it, because I've heard bad things.

2212
02:31:33,499 --> 02:31:40,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I downloaded the demo, which, you know, not always indicative of the quality of the game, but from what I understand, the demo's really close.

2213
02:31:41,850 --> 02:31:47,774
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's just, it ruins everything that I like about Silent Hill.

2214
02:31:48,415 --> 02:32:00,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dungeon crawler with breakable weapons, mixed up characters and it's got a store for goodness sakes that you visit to buy things.

2215
02:32:02,011 --> 02:32:03,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your Diablo out of my Silent Hill.

2216
02:32:28,695 --> 02:32:29,816
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2217
02:32:46,937 --> 02:32:51,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I expected better from this company because they did like the ports of Contra.

2218
02:32:52,558 --> 02:32:57,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not ports, but like they did Contra 4 and A Boy and His Blob, the remake.

2219
02:32:58,319 --> 02:33:00,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, very disappointed.

2220
02:33:01,060 --> 02:33:04,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, BlackWolf in our chatroom says, quote, I hate Silent Hill.

2221
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not Mass Effect.

2222
02:33:05,461 --> 02:33:06,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Shane, back of the box.

2223
02:33:08,581 --> 02:33:10,141
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that is not true.

2224
02:33:10,201 --> 02:33:12,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I like other things that are not Mass Effect, just not as much.

2225
02:33:15,003 --> 02:33:17,103
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what's the number two thing you want to talk about tonight?

2226
02:33:19,144 --> 02:33:19,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap, what was it?

2227
02:33:20,004 --> 02:33:20,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mass Effect.

2228
02:33:21,684 --> 02:33:22,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, of course.

2229
02:33:23,865 --> 02:33:42,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I am greatly disheartened at the fact that they have confirmed no Shepard for the next game, and they also are saying that it's not going to be like another Shepard-type character, which leads me to think that it may not even be the same style of gameplay, which I'm very, very, very worried about.

2230
02:33:43,209 --> 02:33:44,629
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be the saga of Garrus.

2231
02:33:45,066 --> 02:33:46,247
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a dancing game.

2232
02:34:07,819 --> 02:34:10,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that means you're going to get this drastically different gameplay.

2233
02:34:10,802 --> 02:34:15,745
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, whatever the niche is about these new consoles, Mass Effect's probably worked it in somehow.

2234
02:34:15,846 --> 02:34:22,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just worried that it'll be like an RTS or something that I hate or a sports game or a strategy game.

2235
02:34:22,791 --> 02:34:43,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just gonna be I think it's gonna be very similar but you know it might handle a little differently might play a little differently like just don't expect the same like interface and all that stuff you see in the first one I think it'll be alright give it a chance I'll give it a chance BioWare made Mass Effect 1 after all and 2 and 3 Shane yell at them for me yell at who?

2236
02:34:44,426 --> 02:34:47,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone who's involved with my Mass Effect not connecting.

2237
02:34:48,629 --> 02:34:50,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who to yell at for that.

2238
02:34:50,149 --> 02:34:51,130
[SPEAKER_05]: She's been trying to play.

2239
02:34:51,690 --> 02:34:53,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, I know somebody she could yell at.

2240
02:34:53,852 --> 02:34:55,052
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

2241
02:34:55,172 --> 02:34:58,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob is your answer.

2242
02:35:00,676 --> 02:35:01,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know this person, actually.

2243
02:35:02,177 --> 02:35:02,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

2244
02:35:03,217 --> 02:35:03,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you off air.

2245
02:35:04,018 --> 02:35:04,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I need my Garrus fix.

2246
02:35:10,629 --> 02:35:12,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's not able to play multiplayer with us instead.

2247
02:35:12,530 --> 02:35:13,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played some multiplayer.

2248
02:35:13,691 --> 02:35:15,232
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't even play single player.

2249
02:35:15,833 --> 02:35:17,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more achievement points than Alan.

2250
02:35:17,414 --> 02:35:17,994
[SPEAKER_05]: How does that work?

2251
02:35:18,315 --> 02:35:20,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not achievement points, but challenge points, whatever that new thing is.

2252
02:35:22,678 --> 02:35:23,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know.

2253
02:35:23,919 --> 02:35:29,743
[SPEAKER_05]: BlackWolf is trolling in our chat room saying, a Mass Effect with the writing team of Borderlands and Portal.

2254
02:35:30,143 --> 02:35:30,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Want.

2255
02:35:31,404 --> 02:35:35,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So, not as good as previous Mass Effect games?

2256
02:35:35,867 --> 02:35:36,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

2257
02:35:36,308 --> 02:35:37,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Borderlands is a good game.

2258
02:35:37,208 --> 02:35:39,350
[SPEAKER_15]: That just means that they'll throw in a lot of dirty humor.

2259
02:35:40,256 --> 02:35:40,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want that.

2260
02:35:40,916 --> 02:35:42,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the seriousness.

2261
02:35:42,797 --> 02:35:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Technus Reality Check says, unfortunately, Bioware has to finish Dragon Age 3 first.

2262
02:35:48,618 --> 02:35:49,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no one cares.

2263
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:51,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I care.

2264
02:35:51,519 --> 02:35:52,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Dragon Age.

2265
02:35:52,279 --> 02:35:58,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like 2, but I'm actually thinking about giving it another shot on some system that I own it on.

2266
02:35:58,101 --> 02:36:07,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know which one I'm going to play it on, but I got excited for the information that leaked out, or not leaked out, but that came out about Dragon Age 3.

2267
02:36:07,364 --> 02:36:08,204
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's no Garrus.

2268
02:36:09,121 --> 02:36:09,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no what?

2269
02:36:09,862 --> 02:36:10,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Garrus.

2270
02:36:11,483 --> 02:36:15,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not all about Garrus like you, so there's no Kayden for me.

2271
02:36:15,346 --> 02:36:16,187
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no Kayden.

2272
02:36:16,828 --> 02:36:17,348
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

2273
02:36:17,468 --> 02:36:19,690
[SPEAKER_15]: There are the little weepy emo elf boys.

2274
02:36:20,891 --> 02:36:22,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I played one of those in the first game.

2275
02:36:23,414 --> 02:36:24,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It was awesome.

2276
02:36:24,595 --> 02:36:25,235
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't sad.

2277
02:36:26,536 --> 02:36:28,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight, Shane?

2278
02:36:30,026 --> 02:36:30,346
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2279
02:36:30,826 --> 02:36:31,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.

2280
02:36:31,807 --> 02:36:34,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, apparently you broke our stream anyway, so thanks for that.

2281
02:36:34,349 --> 02:36:34,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

2282
02:36:35,109 --> 02:36:36,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm proud of that.

2283
02:36:36,470 --> 02:36:36,750
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2284
02:36:36,790 --> 02:36:37,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'm hanging up on you.

2285
02:36:37,631 --> 02:36:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2286
02:36:38,511 --> 02:36:38,792
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2287
02:36:38,812 --> 02:36:40,553
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2288
02:36:41,113 --> 02:36:42,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Who am I talking to right now?

2289
02:36:42,274 --> 02:36:44,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody, because the stream's not connected, apparently.

2290
02:36:46,357 --> 02:36:46,677
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2291
02:36:47,217 --> 02:36:51,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it did just reconnect, so hopefully some people will hear this and know that the Skype line is open again.

2292
02:36:51,960 --> 02:36:53,762
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2293
02:36:54,082 --> 02:36:55,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say that right?

2294
02:36:55,082 --> 02:36:55,743
[SPEAKER_05]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2295
02:36:55,843 --> 02:36:57,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2296
02:36:59,125 --> 02:37:00,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we ever figure out if that was the host thing?

2297
02:37:01,046 --> 02:37:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously our internet here is not having issues.

2298
02:37:05,468 --> 02:37:07,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not our internet here.

2299
02:37:07,409 --> 02:37:14,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It is either... Well, I don't even think it's our connection getting to the server because wouldn't that mean our IRC should go down?

2300
02:37:15,794 --> 02:37:17,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Our internet would stop working.

2301
02:37:17,335 --> 02:37:20,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd get booted from Mass Effect or whatever you're doing in there.

2302
02:37:20,396 --> 02:37:21,677
[SPEAKER_05]: All that should happen too, right?

2303
02:37:28,987 --> 02:37:45,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I blame New Jersey the entire state let's try to go I think maybe other things don't get disrupted by little internet hiccups but the feed will just shut down if that happens

2304
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:54,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, anyhow Let's move on Loki, did you have any last minute stories for us?

2305
02:37:54,042 --> 02:38:04,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've got some tweets I can do here No, I don't have any Let me go to a tweet from Actdeft that says Oh, the Wii U's first commercial from Europe

2306
02:38:06,454 --> 02:38:08,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know the Wii U. That's actually the commercial.

2307
02:38:08,975 --> 02:38:09,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry.

2308
02:38:09,295 --> 02:38:15,056
[SPEAKER_01]: At last, a brand new console with a brand new controller that redefines how you interact with games.

2309
02:38:15,356 --> 02:38:16,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is Wii U?

2310
02:38:17,737 --> 02:38:19,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot at the TV like never before.

2311
02:38:20,037 --> 02:38:21,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin!

2312
02:38:22,198 --> 02:38:22,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice shooting.

2313
02:38:22,898 --> 02:38:25,819
[SPEAKER_01]: And say someone wants to watch TV when you're halfway through a game.

2314
02:38:26,119 --> 02:38:27,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to watch the TV now.

2315
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:29,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Do both, and everyone's happy.

2316
02:38:32,566 --> 02:38:37,869
[SPEAKER_01]: See a different perspective with the gamepad and get closer to your target for a more precise shot.

2317
02:38:40,030 --> 02:38:41,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a real commercial?

2318
02:38:41,091 --> 02:38:41,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a real commercial.

2319
02:38:41,831 --> 02:38:44,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in here, but I wanted to point out something that I read.

2320
02:38:45,633 --> 02:38:54,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Do notice when they say play games that you've never seen before or something like that, and they show Batman Arkham City.

2321
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:56,840
[SPEAKER_05]: The skyline is ringing off the hook, so I need to get one of these calls.

2322
02:38:56,860 --> 02:38:57,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2323
02:38:57,760 --> 02:38:58,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's this?

2324
02:38:58,981 --> 02:38:59,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you guys hear me?

2325
02:39:00,042 --> 02:39:01,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, you're very, very quiet.

2326
02:39:01,442 --> 02:39:02,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn it up a little bit.

2327
02:39:03,123 --> 02:39:03,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try.

2328
02:39:03,643 --> 02:39:04,684
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just stupid.

2329
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:05,624
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy's being a pain.

2330
02:39:06,225 --> 02:39:08,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can barely hear you and the listeners probably can't hear you either.

2331
02:39:09,666 --> 02:39:10,226
[SPEAKER_09]: How about now?

2332
02:39:11,147 --> 02:39:11,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, you're still quiet.

2333
02:39:13,608 --> 02:39:14,569
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll give it one more go.

2334
02:39:15,929 --> 02:39:16,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Crank it up.

2335
02:39:18,470 --> 02:39:20,792
[SPEAKER_09]: May I have to shout it in this case?

2336
02:39:21,032 --> 02:39:22,152
[SPEAKER_05]: We can hear you a little bit.

2337
02:39:22,212 --> 02:39:22,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2338
02:39:22,552 --> 02:39:22,853
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

2339
02:39:23,133 --> 02:39:23,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is this?

2340
02:39:24,173 --> 02:39:26,294
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, this is DDR Dollar Bill.

2341
02:39:26,434 --> 02:39:27,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, DDR Dollar Bill, what's on your mind?

2342
02:39:28,581 --> 02:39:30,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, not much.

2343
02:39:30,302 --> 02:39:35,565
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys mentioned earlier about you gave a shout out to those who participated in the Extra Life Marathon.

2344
02:39:35,705 --> 02:39:35,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2345
02:39:36,606 --> 02:39:38,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I took part in that too for the first time.

2346
02:39:38,507 --> 02:39:39,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

2347
02:39:40,068 --> 02:39:40,588
[SPEAKER_09]: How'd you do?

2348
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:47,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I lasted for quite a while, but I dozed off at around six something.

2349
02:39:48,213 --> 02:39:48,713
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

2350
02:39:49,758 --> 02:39:52,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it taught me something very interesting.

2351
02:39:53,280 --> 02:40:03,587
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, me and my coworker at work actually managed to raise a decent amount of money in two days because we just got the okay from our job to take part in this.

2352
02:40:03,927 --> 02:40:04,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

2353
02:40:05,228 --> 02:40:10,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And second off, it is so hard to do 24 hours of gaming alone.

2354
02:40:11,821 --> 02:40:15,503
[SPEAKER_09]: on some games because some games just bored the hell out of me after an hour.

2355
02:40:16,343 --> 02:40:17,023
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you do it?

2356
02:40:17,063 --> 02:40:24,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you try to do one game for the whole 24 hours or were you like, okay, every hour we're going to switch or how did you do that?

2357
02:40:24,987 --> 02:40:31,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I switched it up about every one hour or two hours depending on the game and how I was feeling when I'm playing it.

2358
02:40:33,522 --> 02:40:33,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.

2359
02:40:34,783 --> 02:40:35,904
[SPEAKER_09]: So what kind of stuff did you play?

2360
02:40:37,866 --> 02:40:38,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

2361
02:40:39,207 --> 02:40:44,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't re-bought a new game in a while because I'm waiting on a new computer to ship in.

2362
02:40:44,952 --> 02:40:51,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was mostly stuff that I had to catch up with in my queue, which is quite a lot, but quite old.

2363
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:54,000
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, things like...

2364
02:40:55,370 --> 02:41:15,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I was catching up in Arkham Asylum for example then there was Red Dead Redemption things like Mod Nation Racers and even Infamous and then I went to the 360 where I caught up with some Rock Band 3 and things like Virtua Fighter 5 so a lot of modern stuff but that's good and were you live streaming this all?

2365
02:41:15,340 --> 02:41:23,684
[SPEAKER_05]: did you stream or were you not or Twitch or whatever one of those sites or were you just kind of doing this at home and trying to get people to sponsor you doing that at home

2366
02:41:24,324 --> 02:41:27,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of it's on Facebook, and I just stayed at home.

2367
02:41:27,807 --> 02:41:33,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't really do the streaming or tweeting because, like I said, it's my first time, so I wasn't exactly sure what to do.

2368
02:41:34,173 --> 02:41:34,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

2369
02:41:34,753 --> 02:41:35,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what?

2370
02:41:35,654 --> 02:41:41,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And even raising $1 is a great effort for the cause, so congrats to you.

2371
02:41:41,419 --> 02:41:44,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you, though, how did you go about raising the money?

2372
02:41:44,722 --> 02:41:49,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just spam a lot on Facebook, or what was your strategy to get people to care?

2373
02:41:50,795 --> 02:41:57,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I had two days to get the money, so I just said, all right, I'm just going to post on Facebook, and whoever gives, whoever gives.

2374
02:41:59,081 --> 02:42:00,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't going to be picky.

2375
02:42:00,101 --> 02:42:02,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, hey, just whatever you can spare.

2376
02:42:02,884 --> 02:42:05,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if it's a dollar or $2 or $12.

2377
02:42:05,165 --> 02:42:07,767
[SPEAKER_09]: It's whatever you can spare.

2378
02:42:07,907 --> 02:42:09,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of my coworkers gave money.

2379
02:42:09,348 --> 02:42:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

2380
02:42:10,189 --> 02:42:13,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, assuming you're doing it all again next year, what are some things you're going to do differently?

2381
02:42:14,532 --> 02:42:16,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the okay about a month in advance.

2382
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:22,118
[SPEAKER_09]: and then start doing a fundraising there and asking everybody I can think of.

2383
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:26,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I also would like to see you guys participate as well.

2384
02:42:27,406 --> 02:42:35,208
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of hard when one of us has a baby to do the 24-hour straight, but we definitely want to get involved in the charity effort.

2385
02:42:35,328 --> 02:42:42,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, last year, DarkSakura and I both did a lot with Umlaut, and we're going to do whatever we can to help this year as well.

2386
02:42:42,770 --> 02:42:44,731
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we're really passionate about.

2387
02:42:44,831 --> 02:42:52,673
[SPEAKER_05]: We do want to try to do our own thing outside of the holidays, just because the holiday is a very crowded time for charity, but charity needs TLC 24 or 7, 365.

2388
02:42:55,334 --> 02:43:17,118
[SPEAKER_05]: so we do want to do something at some point we think especially with the VOG Network behind us you know get Bobby and Critical Myth and some of the other shows in on it try to do some type of and maybe not necessarily just games we have to really think about this but some type of nerding out for charity and I got we got to really put the put the borders on that but I think there's an idea in there somewhere

2389
02:43:18,603 --> 02:43:19,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, I see.

2390
02:43:19,864 --> 02:43:22,785
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good idea, actually.

2391
02:43:22,865 --> 02:43:25,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anybody would say no to geeking out for charity.

2392
02:43:25,627 --> 02:43:26,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

2393
02:43:26,307 --> 02:43:27,908
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have to figure out exactly how to do it.

2394
02:43:28,008 --> 02:43:30,209
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see what we can do.

2395
02:43:30,229 --> 02:43:33,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have one more quick question.

2396
02:43:33,870 --> 02:43:34,711
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just a quick one.

2397
02:43:35,495 --> 02:43:38,177
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it about World of Warcraft that keeps you guys playing?

2398
02:43:38,497 --> 02:43:39,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to know that.

2399
02:43:39,258 --> 02:43:39,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Pandas.

2400
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:42,301
[SPEAKER_05]: The other people that play.

2401
02:43:43,061 --> 02:43:45,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, having the community.

2402
02:43:45,523 --> 02:43:50,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not necessarily just talking strangers, but like friends or people that have become my friends through the game.

2403
02:43:51,208 --> 02:43:55,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, being able to log in and say, hey, it's a chat room with fireballs and swords.

2404
02:43:56,472 --> 02:43:57,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

2405
02:43:57,453 --> 02:43:58,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly it.

2406
02:43:58,754 --> 02:43:58,974
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2407
02:43:58,994 --> 02:43:59,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, take care, buddy.

2408
02:43:59,855 --> 02:44:00,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one.

2409
02:44:00,315 --> 02:44:00,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You too.

2410
02:44:00,956 --> 02:44:01,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

2411
02:44:01,096 --> 02:44:01,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the call.

2412
02:44:01,816 --> 02:44:02,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for doing Extra Life.

2413
02:44:02,857 --> 02:44:03,237
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

2414
02:44:03,958 --> 02:44:04,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Anytime.

2415
02:44:04,378 --> 02:44:04,679
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2416
02:44:04,719 --> 02:44:04,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

2417
02:44:06,567 --> 02:44:08,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do need to get in on more stuff like that.

2418
02:44:08,308 --> 02:44:08,568
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.

2419
02:44:09,549 --> 02:44:11,391
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, there's a lot of charity events.

2420
02:44:11,411 --> 02:44:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do them all, but we'll plug wherever we can.

2421
02:44:15,594 --> 02:44:16,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

2422
02:44:18,143 --> 02:44:20,804
[SPEAKER_05]: 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2423
02:44:20,824 --> 02:44:24,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm falling way behind on some of these Twitter stories, so let me get to some other ones of these here.

2424
02:44:24,925 --> 02:44:27,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Tigerclaw sends a few over here.

2425
02:44:28,586 --> 02:44:33,068
[SPEAKER_05]: One saying, UK man faces jail time for selling counterfeit Nintendo games.

2426
02:44:33,208 --> 02:44:34,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'd read about this previously.

2427
02:44:35,528 --> 02:44:40,690
[SPEAKER_05]: A 41-year-old Justin Success Brooks, well, not living up to his middle name right now,

2428
02:44:41,670 --> 02:44:49,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, he did fraudulent sale of counterfeit Nintendo games, this is all allegedly, according to the Criot and Guardian.

2429
02:44:50,073 --> 02:44:55,055
[SPEAKER_05]: He was caught in an investigation conducted by Nintendo and then the UK Interactive Entertainment Association.

2430
02:44:55,695 --> 02:44:59,236
[SPEAKER_05]: He trafficked illegal Nintendo goods from 2009 and 2011.

2431
02:45:00,056 --> 02:45:03,517
[SPEAKER_05]: He made almost a million dollars in US dollars.

2432
02:45:03,537 --> 02:45:04,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about 600,000 pounds.

2433
02:45:05,858 --> 02:45:31,724
[SPEAKER_05]: selling counterfeit Wii DS and DSi games he was charged with seven counts of fraud two counts of fraudulent trading two counts of supplying an article to use in a fraud two counts of unauthorized possession of goods bearing a trademark and one count of unauthorized use of the trademark is what that all boils down to he did plead guilty to all counts he's awaiting sentencing boy oh boy all right let's do one more call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

2434
02:45:32,998 --> 02:45:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, this is Braginator.

2435
02:45:35,039 --> 02:45:36,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, Braginator?

2436
02:45:36,340 --> 02:45:37,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Haven't heard from you in a while.

2437
02:45:38,021 --> 02:45:39,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know, it's kind of a long story.

2438
02:45:40,263 --> 02:45:46,928
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of posted on what's been going on on the blog forum, so I won't rehash that.

2439
02:45:46,988 --> 02:45:47,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

2440
02:45:47,388 --> 02:45:47,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what's up?

2441
02:45:47,908 --> 02:45:48,449
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

2442
02:45:49,329 --> 02:45:55,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I, God forbid, I actually got my first PC game last weekend.

2443
02:45:55,173 --> 02:45:58,435
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of an older title, but definitely good one.

2444
02:45:58,455 --> 02:46:00,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you guys would approve Diablo 2.

2445
02:46:01,792 --> 02:46:03,333
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a classic.

2446
02:46:03,793 --> 02:46:04,913
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a classic.

2447
02:46:05,573 --> 02:46:11,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, you should just keep playing that one and pretend it's 3 because then you'll be more satisfied.

2448
02:46:11,376 --> 02:46:12,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm trolling, I'm trolling.

2449
02:46:13,496 --> 02:46:14,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Making the Diablo 3 fans mad.

2450
02:46:15,577 --> 02:46:23,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Truth be told, seeing that I don't have access to a PlayStation 3 for the time being, I need something to play.

2451
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:27,241
[SPEAKER_11]: I was sure that Diablo 2 would run on my machine.

2452
02:46:28,062 --> 02:46:29,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Saw that at the store.

2453
02:46:29,122 --> 02:46:31,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of figured, what the heck, pick it up.

2454
02:46:32,375 --> 02:46:35,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're playing the classics right now.

2455
02:46:35,656 --> 02:46:39,258
[SPEAKER_05]: What made you choose Diablo 2 out of all the games you could have picked out there?

2456
02:46:40,519 --> 02:46:44,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I wanted to get a game legally as opposed to some kind of torrent.

2457
02:46:44,941 --> 02:46:46,501
[SPEAKER_11]: So torrents were out.

2458
02:46:49,851 --> 02:46:56,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the edutainment titles they would give for kids definitely don't appeal to me.

2459
02:46:56,817 --> 02:47:09,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty sure that even though my new computer is a little bit more high-tech than my old computer that was stolen, games like Grand Theft Auto and whatnot probably won't run on my computer.

2460
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:13,873
[SPEAKER_11]: So I kind of figured, all right, Diablo II is what?

2461
02:47:15,969 --> 02:47:17,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It might even be older than that, actually.

2462
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:18,630
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's old.

2463
02:47:18,871 --> 02:47:19,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Very old.

2464
02:47:30,831 --> 02:47:31,792
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2465
02:47:48,573 --> 02:47:49,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, yes.

2466
02:47:49,754 --> 02:47:53,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to put a new battery in it.

2467
02:47:53,856 --> 02:47:57,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't set fire to your house when it's crying out for a low battery.

2468
02:47:57,897 --> 02:47:58,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be careful.

2469
02:47:59,098 --> 02:48:01,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, how do you sleep with that going?

2470
02:48:02,769 --> 02:48:04,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I learned to tune it out, actually, so... Yeah, well...

2471
02:48:25,293 --> 02:48:31,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't engage in any kind of dangerous activities in my place, but I never know what my neighbors... That's right.

2472
02:48:31,795 --> 02:48:34,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Your neighbors might be smoking marijuana, and you don't even know.

2473
02:48:34,635 --> 02:48:34,915
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2474
02:48:35,636 --> 02:48:39,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, the thing I really wanted to tell you about was you should check out this website.

2475
02:48:40,177 --> 02:48:51,139
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're interested in getting games legally, especially old stuff that will play on your computer and, you know, safe, I would look into a website called GOG.com, and that's G-O-G.com.

2476
02:48:51,159 --> 02:48:53,460
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Good Old Games, and they sell...

2477
02:48:53,900 --> 02:48:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: tons of old stuff and a lot of it goes for like five bucks, seven bucks and there's some really good stuff in there.

2478
02:48:59,905 --> 02:49:04,509
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, they're trying to kind of cash in on the indie bundle craze right now.

2479
02:49:04,990 --> 02:49:17,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it's really an indie bundle per se but they have like an interplay bundle going on right now where for like 35 bucks you can get like 50 games and there's some classics in there like Descent and Castles which was a game I used to play.

2480
02:49:17,841 --> 02:49:21,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great website and I have to recommend it.

2481
02:49:21,664 --> 02:49:28,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and Dungeon Buster says... Another game that I probably should get back into is World of Warcraft, if only because

2482
02:49:30,009 --> 02:49:36,953
[SPEAKER_11]: I did download the clients and go compare and try to play although the framing was extremely choppy.

2483
02:49:37,233 --> 02:49:40,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can say goodbye to your life if you get back into World of Warcraft.

2484
02:49:41,255 --> 02:49:43,917
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but well, the graphics have come a long way.

2485
02:49:46,298 --> 02:49:49,319
[SPEAKER_11]: More powerful.

2486
02:49:49,339 --> 02:49:50,340
[SPEAKER_05]: The game will be better.

2487
02:49:52,461 --> 02:49:52,721
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2488
02:49:52,981 --> 02:49:57,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ragenazer, I need to let you go so we can wrap things up, but take care and have fun with Diablo 2.

2489
02:49:57,947 --> 02:49:59,087
[SPEAKER_05]: take care, bye bye

2490
02:50:16,352 --> 02:50:21,998
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's all hope that Ragenator gets the battery replaced and a smoke detector soon.

2491
02:50:22,338 --> 02:50:23,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on.

2492
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:27,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to do the rest of these Twitter topics because there's still a bunch of these here.

2493
02:50:27,503 --> 02:50:29,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did the one about Tigerclaw and the counterfeit time.

2494
02:50:30,486 --> 02:50:32,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me read one other tweet from Tigerclaw.

2495
02:50:32,367 --> 02:50:33,408
[SPEAKER_05]: He sent a couple others.

2496
02:50:34,589 --> 02:50:37,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually I do a two-tweet max, but these are both pretty good.

2497
02:50:38,053 --> 02:50:38,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

2498
02:50:40,845 --> 02:50:44,228
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about the Zynga lawsuit that was settled.

2499
02:50:45,349 --> 02:50:48,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Zynga sued the makers of Pyramidville because they used the word ville.

2500
02:50:49,152 --> 02:50:50,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Kobojo was the name of the company.

2501
02:50:51,794 --> 02:50:55,317
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually settled and Pyramidville is now Pyramid Valley.

2502
02:50:55,837 --> 02:50:56,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't believe it.

2503
02:50:56,938 --> 02:50:57,439
[SPEAKER_05]: They caved.

2504
02:50:58,660 --> 02:50:59,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

2505
02:50:59,861 --> 02:51:00,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor guys.

2506
02:51:00,802 --> 02:51:04,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, here's the other one from Tiger Claw that I think is definitely worth reporting on here.

2507
02:51:04,885 --> 02:51:09,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's a Steam vulnerability that can lead to a remote insertion of malicious code.

2508
02:51:09,208 --> 02:51:16,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Now don't panic, for God's sake, but you know when Steam gets a hole poked in it, a lot of people are going to be talking about it.

2509
02:51:16,594 --> 02:51:19,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently there's a vulnerability in the Steam browser.

2510
02:51:19,397 --> 02:51:20,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Does Steam come out when you poke a hole in it?

2511
02:51:24,701 --> 02:51:26,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the Steam browser protocol.

2512
02:51:26,722 --> 02:51:32,605
[SPEAKER_05]: When you use, instead of like HTTP to go to a website, you use Steam colon slash slash to go to a website.

2513
02:51:33,125 --> 02:51:37,467
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can get a user to click on a link for a specially formed Steam URL,

2514
02:51:37,907 --> 02:51:46,455
[SPEAKER_05]: An attacker can remotely exploit buffer overflow bugs and other vulnerabilities in Steam games and Steam itself to get malicious code on a target's machine.

2515
02:51:46,535 --> 02:51:48,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So please be careful what you click on.

2516
02:51:48,917 --> 02:51:52,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But knowing Valve, this shit is probably already patched.

2517
02:51:53,061 --> 02:51:55,143
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be on it very soon.

2518
02:51:55,604 --> 02:51:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2519
02:51:57,285 --> 02:51:59,027
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2520
02:52:18,124 --> 02:52:19,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So very cute.

2521
02:52:19,625 --> 02:52:19,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.

2522
02:52:20,605 --> 02:52:21,846
[SPEAKER_05]: It is available for download.

2523
02:52:21,866 --> 02:52:26,228
[SPEAKER_05]: The only place you're going to find it is on the forums at vognetwork.com slash forums.

2524
02:52:26,609 --> 02:52:30,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Check the Orange Lounge Radio Forum for the President Cat Pong download.

2525
02:52:31,011 --> 02:52:32,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job, Dark Tetsuya.

2526
02:52:33,772 --> 02:52:34,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft.

2527
02:52:35,393 --> 02:52:41,435
[SPEAKER_05]: tweets about Forza Horizon's rally expansion and Street Pass, oh, Season Pass, excuse me.

2528
02:52:42,415 --> 02:52:45,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Forza Horizon, of course, is launching on October 23rd.

2529
02:52:46,277 --> 02:52:54,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, what's happening with this, for 1,600 Microsoft points, you can get the Forza Horizon rally expansion pack.

2530
02:52:54,299 --> 02:52:58,841
[SPEAKER_05]: It is included with the Season Pass, however, and I guess you get...

2531
02:53:00,347 --> 02:53:05,469
[SPEAKER_05]: An off-road racing experience with deeper ruts, higher jumps, and new surface types to explore.

2532
02:53:05,829 --> 02:53:07,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an add-on pack for Forza.

2533
02:53:07,850 --> 02:53:08,670
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you need to know?

2534
02:53:08,690 --> 02:53:09,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at them shiny cars.

2535
02:53:10,651 --> 02:53:11,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at them shiny, pretty cars.

2536
02:53:13,431 --> 02:53:15,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I am terrible at Forza, just for the record.

2537
02:53:16,813 --> 02:53:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt sent that same link about Skyrim at Rice University.

2538
02:53:21,334 --> 02:53:23,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Bummer, we already talked about that.

2539
02:53:24,555 --> 02:53:25,536
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for Twitter topics.

2540
02:53:26,176 --> 02:53:28,296
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Loki?

2541
02:53:28,316 --> 02:53:29,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have anything else you wanted to throw out there?

2542
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:32,602
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have nothing.

2543
02:53:44,875 --> 02:53:47,076
[SPEAKER_05]: A new system software update for PlayStation 3, 4.3.

2544
02:53:48,937 --> 02:53:52,138
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll make changes to how trophies are displayed on your PlayStation 3.

2545
02:53:52,818 --> 02:53:55,719
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now in the PlayStation Network on the cross media bar.

2546
02:53:55,919 --> 02:53:56,299
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2547
02:53:57,320 --> 02:53:57,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2548
02:53:58,540 --> 02:54:05,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, by the beginning of November 2012, we will retire the services available through the Life with PlayStation application.

2549
02:54:06,223 --> 02:54:10,205
[SPEAKER_05]: We will stop offering the Life with PlayStation application to new users with the 4.3 update.

2550
02:54:11,465 --> 02:54:40,692
[SPEAKER_05]: this includes the conclusion of our participation with Stanford University's Folding at Home over 15 million users participated in the program they've donated more than 100 million computation hours to the Folding at Home project considering the contribution PS3 has made to the project we decided to retire it as a result of discussions with Stanford University so at least it wasn't like they just yanked the plug but I guess it was a mutual decision that's kind of interesting

2551
02:54:41,273 --> 02:54:43,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they find the cure of what they were looking for?

2552
02:54:43,304 --> 02:54:43,826
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

2553
02:54:46,423 --> 02:54:53,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least it was a mutual decision, but I hope it wasn't one of those mutual decision meaning Sony went to Stanford saying, this is what we're going to do.

2554
02:54:53,805 --> 02:54:55,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us how you're going to deal with it.

2555
02:54:56,246 --> 02:54:56,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2556
02:54:56,766 --> 02:54:58,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like it was a good thing.

2557
02:54:58,186 --> 02:54:59,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Beg for us to change your mind.

2558
02:54:59,947 --> 02:55:00,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

2559
02:55:00,907 --> 02:55:01,167
[SPEAKER_04]: No?

2560
02:55:02,127 --> 02:55:02,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.

2561
02:55:04,028 --> 02:55:05,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right.

2562
02:55:06,188 --> 02:55:07,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's all I've got.

2563
02:55:08,009 --> 02:55:09,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you don't have any more last minute stories?

2564
02:55:10,369 --> 02:55:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any more last minute stories?

2565
02:55:11,870 --> 02:55:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that means we're at the end of the show.

2566
02:55:13,110 --> 02:55:14,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Windows 8's out this week, right?

2567
02:55:15,051 --> 02:55:15,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Excited?

2568
02:55:16,431 --> 02:55:16,972
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2569
02:55:17,032 --> 02:55:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2570
02:55:17,152 --> 02:55:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2571
02:55:38,713 --> 02:55:44,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, of course, kind words on iTunes reviews, Stitcher promotions, things like that.

2572
02:55:44,917 --> 02:55:46,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Other iOS devices.

2573
02:55:46,879 --> 02:55:47,679
[SPEAKER_05]: What other apps are there?

2574
02:55:47,719 --> 02:55:48,220
[SPEAKER_05]: TuneIn.

2575
02:55:48,440 --> 02:55:49,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even think of them all.

2576
02:55:49,280 --> 02:55:49,741
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many.

2577
02:55:49,781 --> 02:55:50,581
[SPEAKER_05]: And Android, too.

2578
02:55:51,963 --> 02:55:55,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan has one I've never even heard of that he uses to listen to podcasts, and it's pretty good.

2579
02:55:55,565 --> 02:55:59,048
[SPEAKER_05]: So wherever you heard about Orange Launch Radio, please help us spread the word.

2580
02:55:59,088 --> 02:55:59,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate it.

2581
02:56:00,769 --> 02:56:02,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, support all the shows on VOG Network.

2582
02:56:03,331 --> 02:56:04,592
[SPEAKER_05]: VOGnetwork.com.

2583
02:56:04,612 --> 02:56:13,161
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a ton of great shows on the network all week long talking about various geek things, not just gaming shows, but TV shows and movies.

2584
02:56:13,302 --> 02:56:16,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no dedicated movie shows yet, but some of them talk about movies.

2585
02:56:17,987 --> 02:56:21,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Things about British TV culture, anime shows, Warcraft shows.

2586
02:56:22,251 --> 02:56:23,352
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all there, VOGnetwork.com.

2587
02:56:24,493 --> 02:56:26,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2588
02:56:26,674 --> 02:56:27,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

2589
02:56:27,714 --> 02:56:28,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Your final thought.

2590
02:56:28,534 --> 02:56:38,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Lisa, if you're going to use Windows 8, there's Start 8 by Stardock that'll actually put the Start menu back so it's not so broken.

2591
02:56:40,257 --> 02:56:40,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2592
02:56:42,278 --> 02:56:43,578
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2593
02:56:44,539 --> 02:56:46,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still pissed that I can't play Mass Effect.

2594
02:56:47,599 --> 02:56:48,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Still so pissed.

2595
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:48,840
[SPEAKER_05]: As you should be.

2596
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:52,201
[SPEAKER_15]: And I miss my kitty.

2597
02:56:52,901 --> 02:56:53,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

2598
02:56:54,505 --> 02:56:54,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2599
02:56:55,586 --> 02:56:59,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my final thought is I'm hungry and I can't wait for dinner.

2600
02:57:00,908 --> 02:57:04,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really too bad that I haven't eaten dinner yet because you know what even sounds better than dinner is Pinkberry.

2601
02:57:06,431 --> 02:57:07,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe later this week.

2602
02:57:07,072 --> 02:57:07,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Pinkberry for dinner.

2603
02:57:08,212 --> 02:57:08,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinkberry for dinner.

2604
02:57:09,033 --> 02:57:09,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Someday.

2605
02:57:09,915 --> 02:57:11,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, and I have one more final thought.

2606
02:57:12,477 --> 02:57:15,038
[SPEAKER_05]: RuPaul's All-Stars Drag Race starts tomorrow, just so you know.

2607
02:57:16,179 --> 02:57:17,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know.

2608
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:18,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Judging you.

2609
02:57:19,241 --> 02:57:20,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the disappointing thing.

2610
02:57:20,162 --> 02:57:22,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You can watch the first episode online right up to the elimination.

2611
02:57:23,504 --> 02:57:24,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

2612
02:57:24,705 --> 02:57:25,886
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't as good as it should be.

2613
02:57:26,526 --> 02:57:27,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the twist.

2614
02:57:27,487 --> 02:57:28,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the twist.

2615
02:57:28,827 --> 02:57:30,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Reality TV twists are stupid.

2616
02:57:31,349 --> 02:57:31,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's it.

2617
02:57:31,989 --> 02:57:35,752
[SPEAKER_05]: If I haven't scared you off already, thanks for tuning into the show and downloading and listening to us.

2618
02:57:36,112 --> 02:57:36,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

2619
02:57:37,213 --> 02:57:38,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a wonderful week.

2620
02:57:38,293 --> 02:57:39,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back to do it all again next time.

2621
02:57:39,894 --> 02:57:40,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night!

2622
02:57:41,778 --> 02:57:44,800
