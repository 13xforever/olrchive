WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Forge, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, October 28th, 2012. Has the Playstation 3 been hacked again?

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Zynga makes some big layoffs. And could not all Wii U features make the system launch?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this October the 28th of 2012, episode number 479 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and all that good stuff with my co-host.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.000
My co-hosts say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. How are you doing?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
You're like sick and stuff, huh?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I have a sinus infection.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
You better not be contagious.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Sinus infections aren't contagious.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Last time you had a sinus infection I got the swine flu.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
You know what, Rob? Okay.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm never going to let you live that down.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
No, that's from not eating enough pork.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh, hi Tech Master, Loki. How are you?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You mentioned pork, sorry.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Alright, what were you going to say, DarkSakura?

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
I was going to say I thought I had a sinus infection and then I ended up getting really sick.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
I ended up not having a very bad version of it and you ended up being, what, bedridden or something?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
So, sorry.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
I can't help it if my immune system is wonderful, Rob, and that everything is just weak sauce when it hits me.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Alright, well if you want to join-

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
I am stronger than the swine flu.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
If you want to join us and talk about sickness or games would be preferred, but you never know.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
Live.vognetwork.com is where you can chat along with us and you can also check in if you are listening live.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Yes, those are on now.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
Man, if it's not up by like the first second the intro music hits, I start getting private messages.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Check-ins are down, check-ins are down, check-ins are down.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
But check-ins are now on for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
A little bit late. Thanks, Bobby.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
We are, of course, live after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
We do tape live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
vognetwork.com.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
Lots of great shows that play on VOG throughout the week, including my other show that's all about the World of Warcraft.

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
The best little Horde house in Azeroth, or Horde house for short.

02:29.000 --> 02:36.000
And the reason why I bring that up, crossover week this week with Girls Gone Wow, our friends over there in the UK.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
And we were on their show today and they're going to come on Horde house later this week.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So it's crossover week. Why? Because sweeps month is coming up.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Sweeps month. So that's when we got to pull out all the stunts.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Crossover shows, super special episodes, and at the end of the month somebody will die.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
We just haven't figured out who yet. Anyhow.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Also I feel kind of bad.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Why?

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
For crocheting when I'm sick.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Because I feel like whoever is going to get the scarf is going to get diseases like I'm a European settler.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
You should feel bad for crocheting when we have so many things in the gaming world to talk about this week.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I can talk and crochet at the same time, Rob.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Actually it was kind of a slower news week. We'll get into that later.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
But let me put it this way. Tonight we have Listless making a comeback tonight.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
It has been forever since we played an OLR game. I was just realizing that earlier.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
So we are bringing back Listless tonight.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Well you don't even know the topic yet.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I don't care. All of my answers are pie. Because of Alan.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
I was going to say you got to try Alan's award winning pumpkin. It's not pumpkin pie. It's like pumpkin mousse dessert thing.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Chocolate chips and pumpkin. Chocolate and pumpkin.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
He won first place at his work in the big bake off. And it's a big deal.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
And he beat the reigning champion and it's not pretty.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
I was fearing for his life actually.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I had to escort him to the parking lot to make sure he wouldn't get jumped.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Were you afraid of severe judgement?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
But everything was okay. So there you go.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
Again, live.vognetwork.com if you want to join us.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
And Dark Tetsuya pointing out there goes Loki talking out of turn again.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
As he tends to do at the top of the show.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
Technically not out of turn. She talked. I talked. I just talked sooner than you were expecting me.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
It's not out of turn though.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And right now? Don't give a shit.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Surprise Loki. Surprise.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
Alright, I don't have a lot of stuff to talk about before we get into our gaming weeks and the news tonight.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Did we actually give Loki a full introduction?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, you mentioned it.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Like, tech glasses.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Who is this guy? Who is this person that's talking?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm gonna flip the table in a second.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I have missed the 478 prior episodes of Orange Launch Radio.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Who is this guy? Seriously.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm taking back my Tootsie Rolls.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
I can't figure it out based on the intro and the two people that have been introduced.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I just wish I could deduce who this was.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Let me go back. Let me go back for a minute here.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Let me listen to Midihead again here.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Bob. You know what? Shut. Stop it. I'm on drugs.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
The show is called Orange Launch Radio.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm on drugs.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
There he is.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
You hush. You know what I was talking about. I will poke you in the eye with this needle.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
Alright, for real though. I have a serious kickoff topic tonight. For real.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
Like, okay, probably the most number, like the highest concentration of listeners for Orange Launch Radio is here in Northern California.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Because that's where we are. That's where a lot of the video games industry is.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
So the highest concentration of Orange Launch Radio is in Northern California.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
The second highest concentration of OLR listeners, I'm pretty sure, is New York City.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
So obviously New York's going through a little bit right now with this whole, I don't know, some woman named Sandy is coming to blow everybody.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Cause she's, you're the one that she wants.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Sound like a porno.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Ooh, hoo, hoo.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
In all seriousness, if you are in the path of that hurricane, I hope you've taken all those precautions to be safe.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
If they've told you to evacuate, please turn off OLR.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
We will be there on the podcast feed later.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And evacuate if that's what they've told you to do.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
But if you have holed yourself up in the house with the walls all boarded up and you've got your liquor ready to go.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Like if DJ Rama's picture earlier was any indication.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Did you see the picture that Rama posted earlier of all his boos?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
He had all his boos. He's like, I'm ready for the hurricane.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
You know what, Rob? Think about New York City and think about trying to evacuate.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Not happening.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
I know, right? Well, they closed the subway. They closed the schools.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
By the time a hurricane hits up there, you know what it's gonna be?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
A sneeze.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I hope you're right.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, cause you know last night-

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
I lose momentum inland.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
Last night they were talking about this tsunami's gonna hit Hawaii and the tsunami's coming in and they had to evacuate the shores.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And then it ended up not really being a big deal.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Like you definitely didn't want to be in the water. It's not a time to surf. Like you could have really hurt yourself.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I'm more worried about Florida.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, well this thing isn't in the path of Florida, I don't think. Is it?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Is it that big of a hurricane?

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
Well, even a small hurricane is fairly big, Rob.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, no matter what. Look, we live in California. This isn't something we really have to deal with here. We have the earthquake thing instead.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
But if you're in the path of this thing, I hope you're safe. That's what I really wanted to say.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
Fill your bathtub full of water. Buy bleach. Get all the bread in the grocery store. And cans.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Ignorant California question. Ignorant California question.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
What? What? What? What?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Why do you fill your bathtub with water?

07:42.000 --> 07:54.000
Well, in case the water pipes break, or you get sewage backed up into the water, you have a tub, which is like what I think, I want to say seven gallons of fresh water.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, so it's like your reserve water.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And you put like two drops of bleach in it to purify it.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
Oh, okay.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
So that way, even if the water lines are down, you have drinking water.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Okay, that makes sense. So you just need to have plenty of drinking water.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, and you know why you tape the windows, right?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Uh, that has to do with the pressure, right? So you don't get blow.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
You don't get to if they actually break the table, hold it, and keep it from shattering.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Okay, yeah, that's what I figured. I knew it was something long.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
It also stops the fog from coming in that turns people inside out.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Shut up.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
That's a Simpsons reference.

08:25.000 --> 08:37.000
Alright, anyhow, um, look, uh, I wanted to bring up this story because I had no idea that somebody was already waiting in line at Nintendo World for a Wii U.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
Isaiah Triforce Johnson, I guess he changed his name to have Triforce in it.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
He is a die-hard Nintendo fan to say the least.

08:46.000 --> 08:52.000
I believe this is him last time with Reggie getting his Wii, so this guy is no stranger to camping out overnight.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Why does Reggie always look like a mannequin?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Because he's pretty.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Look at his eyes.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
Because his body was ready for cybernetic enhancement.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
He looks like he's a wax man.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
He's perfectly groomed. He's a well-groomed man. There's nothing wrong with that.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
He's gotta be a public figure for Nintendo. He can't look crazy.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Like if Doc Brown came up and like,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Hi, I'm Wii U!

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
His skin looks waxy.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Does he wax his face?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That might sell me a Wii U.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Well, anyway, look, the real story.

09:21.000 --> 09:31.000
Mr. Triforce Johnson had to give up his spot in line because they basically said that the security at Rockefeller Center said you need to vacate by 6 p.m.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So he had to actually leave.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
However, it has been promised that he may return to his place after Nintendo World reopens when the hurricane has passed.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
So the hurricane has already caused at least one major disruption.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
Oh, well, then we should just call this hurricane, Hurricane Common Sense.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Because who the fuck lines up for a Wii U a month before it comes out?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
If this thing is disastrous, you are going to feel bad about making jokes about it.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
No, I'm not going to feel bad. I feel no remorse.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
No pity, and he will not stop until you are dead.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Wait, that was Terminator, sorry.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
I can understand lining up a couple days ahead of time or the night of, but a month ahead of time?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
He wanted to be the first.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
May as well just stay in line for the next Nintendo system.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Alright, let's see, questions from our chat room.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Very important questions from chat at live.vognetwork.com.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
Taiki asks, who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B? I think that's a Loki question.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Loki, who's prettier, Reggie or Cliffy B?

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Well, Cliffy does have the youth going for him when he is a lot younger.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
Reggie's kind of trollish, so it's hard to say.

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
But Reggie is probably much nicer in person, whereas Cliffy kind of comes off as a douche.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
The thing about Cliffy, and I know this is exactly what you wanted to hear on a video game podcast this week.

10:56.000 --> 11:02.000
The thing about Cliffy is he kind of has that male porn star hair going for him that's not doing him any favors.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
Because straight men in porn, not always that exciting to look at.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
And he's kind of got that hair going for it.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
It's like some minus points.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
But you're right, he does have that youth factor. He doesn't look waxy like Reggie.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Male porn stars always make me think of diseases.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Walking herpes.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
WhatupG in chat says Nintendo should just send him a Wii U.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Do you think Mr. Triforce Johnson has earned the damn Wii U at this point?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Nintendo wants money.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat says Nintendo did say he will still be the first in line.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Which is good PR for Nintendo.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
There you go.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
I would have laughed if someone snuck in front of him before.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
What, I was waiting here before you. You left.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Rama, run out there quick.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Alright, there you go.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
Even though we're having fun with the subject and the story and everything.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
First off, props to that guy for being so damn dedicated. You know what, props to you sir.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
And second off, for real, we hope everybody is safe in this hurricane. Please be safe.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Don't be stupid.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
No props to him for standing out there a month in advance.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
He's actually on the payroll for Nintendo a little bit as well.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
It's part of the problem.

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
He's done some events and stuff for Nintendo and actually covered stuff as a liaison for Nintendo.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I'm sorry, no. No props for this dude standing out a month in advance.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, cool. You're a dedicated Nintendo fan.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, you couldn't be up Reggie's ass a little bit more than you are.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
So, I mean, cool that you're really excited.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
If Reggie's ass is as waxy as the rest of him, then it should be as smooth as...

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
This is starting to go to a place I'm not okay with.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm just not...

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
Just throwing it out there.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
I'm just...

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
It's just like those people that stand...

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
You know, I understand it's like, oh hey, it's fandom and stuff like that.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
There's got to be a line to draw here, okay?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
It'd be like me, well, I'm going to stand out in front of this building for a year

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
because I'm waiting for the next Xbox 360 or something.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
People are going to be like, no, you're an idiot.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
You should go stand in line for Breaking Dawn Part 2.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
No.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
No, I'm not.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
You know someone is somewhere.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
No, no one is.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Because you know why?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Because they don't have to do that anymore.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
They have Fandango and places you can buy tickets online.

13:35.000 --> 13:41.000
So that, you know, all those people are like, oh hey, I waited here for a couple days to get my tickets to Batman.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
You're like, fuck you, I just spent two seconds and went online and got tickets for Batman.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, who's the idiot now?

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
There are some movies where they do the midnight openings where they don't put them up on Fandango.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Alright, let's...

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
I, however, saw Frankenweenie opening night at Disneyland.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
The end.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
And trust me...

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, can I touch you?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
No.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
I might catch gay.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Speaking of movies, speaking of movies, and I know we already had movies as a kickoff topic a couple weeks ago.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Are we going to see The Gift?

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
But I quickly want to say Silent Hill 3D Revelation. I did not see it yet. None of us did.

14:15.000 --> 14:22.000
But I hear it is so bad. Like it's showgirls bad. Without the tits. Like it is really bad.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
And that makes me want to see it more.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Rob, let's do this.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
What?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Next week.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
We need to see it at some point.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Just, you know.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Tomorrow night.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
We'll have your people call my people and find a time.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Tomorrow night.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
That actually probably will work.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Okay.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
But I don't know. I've got to make sure the other half won't be mad I see it without them.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, I'll be going SNIFF SNORT.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Because I'll be sick.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
And then, of course, this coming week, Wreck-It Ralph.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Which I know we've all been excited about.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
One other thing I heard about that movie is that the flashlights, the shine from the flashlights are in 3D.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Oh boy.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
I know, right?

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
Our buddy Mel, you know, Mel B, the classic DDR freestyler.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
He, I don't know, he got some type of hookup or passes, won them, I don't know.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
He got to already see Wreck-It Ralph.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And he gave it his stamp of approval.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
And that's pretty important.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
So we know that movie isn't going to completely suck.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
So I'm excited about that.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
The City Vampire, pointing out in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
Silent Hill has a less than 10% rating on RottenTomatoes.com.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
That's when you know it's like really bad.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
It's not like 30% bad, it's less than 10% bad.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
I actually liked the first one.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
I did too.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
I saw it four times in the theater, I own two copies of it.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Shit.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
So I have to see this.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Alright.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Raginator in chat says, showgirls should be remade in 3D.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Nothing beats 3D boobs, right?

15:45.000 --> 15:50.000
That may be true, but honestly, when it comes to showgirls, nothing beats going to the Castro theater

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
and watching a bunch of drag queens reenact the scene where she comes out of the volcano.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I'm so mad I missed it this year.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
That's like your reason to live right there.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
And if you want a close second into a possible showgirls in 3D,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
you can just watch like, what is it, Piranha 3D.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
That's true.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
That's true.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
I'm actually super upset that I missed showgirls this year.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
There's always next year.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Next year we need a huge group.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Back to video games and what we have been playing this week.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
Mass Effect, the first one, because my Mass Effect 3 still doesn't work.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I mean, I can kind of get it to run and I've gotten into multiplayer now,

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
but it's like, it's just awful and they've escalated me again.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
This will come up in the FUs.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
And I've hardly played any WoW, actually.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
You had like hella customer service EA stuff this week, didn't you?

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
I was on with two different customer service reps on their live chat for seven hours.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
And one of the guys was super cool.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
The other guy was, okay, okay, okay.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
I have no problem with people from other countries.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
I have a problem with them when they're outsourcing our jobs.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
You know, when EA is sending a job and I know India's always picked on,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
but it definitely was an Indian name.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
And I was like, dude, no offense to you.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
I want to speak to somebody in U.S. customer service who actually will listen to what I'm saying

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
and not just make assumptions about what I'm saying.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Because if you go back and read the log, you'll understand this has nothing to do with my DLC.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
It has to do with the damn patch.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
The thing about outsourced customer service in general, and it doesn't matter what country it's from,

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
even within the U.S. outsourcing sometimes, is that they usually are stuck to a script.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
And if your inquiry or your question deviates from that script

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
and the things that they are very literally trained to handle, that's when you start to run into issues.

17:51.000 --> 17:59.000
And unfortunately, what upper management fails to see a lot of the time is that most inquiries go off script.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
I worked in customer service for how long?

18:02.000 --> 18:09.000
The reason why I was good is because I stopped following my script because I knew what I was talking about.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
And this has just gone on way too long.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
And I finally, you know, they said, oh, we'll do the email service.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
And they had me do a trace, which that I thought was a good idea to see if there was a connection problem on my end.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
But I can tell you right when the problem started, it started with the last patch.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
The patch did something because before that I had no problem.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
So just so tired of it.

18:35.000 --> 18:43.000
And and also just with I started getting I started with the sinus infection yesterday.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
It was while I was out running errands. It's just I haven't really felt like playing much in the way of games.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
And then when I got home, I was like, I want to play Mass Effect because I'm playing back through and doing all the stuff that

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
because the first time I just blew through the game.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
And this time I'm I made Caden jealous, which was awesome.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
And then I picked Liara over him. So he ran out in a snit.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
And then I'm also though now I feel really dirty because, like, it's the equivalent of a 32 year old woman dating an 18 year old.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Because Liara is basically she's the equivalent mentally of an 18 year old.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
It's dating a child. It does not work. It feels very wrong.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
So, you know, these are all fake people, right?

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
I know Liara is blue. I know.

19:29.000 --> 19:34.000
But OK, it's the point, though, of believability.

19:34.000 --> 19:39.000
And what one because I mean, yeah, some people are really into dating children, I guess.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
You know, I maybe it's just I'm spoiled by Garris.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
I don't know. Acidic vampire in our chat room asks, have other people had the same problem with the patch?

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Yes, I'm not the only one.

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
So it's been going on. And actually, people are now referencing my thing on the EA answer thing on BioWare's forums.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
Several people have reposted it. A bunch of us have actually gone on to the Mass Effect Facebook page and linked it, which they've deleted.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
Interesting. All right. Loki, let's move on to you. How was your gaming week?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
I played Minecraft. It's pretty much it.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.000
I mean, I was working on some stuff for that just on the roller coaster that I had there.

20:20.000 --> 20:29.000
We added some more pixel art stuff in there, have a portion where it jumps into the mouth of a piranha plant, which is pretty sweet.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
And then was a hit son was making.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
He made a knight's was I remember the main character knight says, I guess knights would be knights.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Yes, made knights flying in the air. So that's kind of cool.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
And we got the new patch this week.

20:48.000 --> 21:00.000
So, you know, updated the server and been playing around command blocks, made some teleportation stations so we can, you know, hop to different parts of the map pretty quick.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
And it's about it. Wish more people are on there because it's usually just me.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And then occasionally I'll see people pop in. But it's been pretty slow.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
I know there's a lot of games out right now, so not surprising.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
I was actually in the play some of those games, but I didn't know which one I wanted to play.

21:19.000 --> 21:26.000
Got into that weird like gamer ADD stuff where I was like, ah, I can play Dishonored and start that game.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
But I want to start another game because I'm already in the middle of Borderlands two.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
And I don't know. It's just it's already beaten that game three times.

21:34.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm sure he has. Oh, and then I guess I played Call of Duty a little bit. Modern Warfare 3.

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Can't wait to play Black Ops 2. It'll be nice to switch up to something different.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
But, yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

21:48.000 --> 21:57.000
My gaming week, I don't have a lot of new stuff to talk about, but I did decide I finally had it with Mass Effect 3 and Origin in general.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
So I am done with the PC version of Mass Effect 3. I want nothing to do with it anymore.

22:02.000 --> 22:12.000
So I went back to Xbox 360 version, which, although it kind of stinks that, you know, the controllers, it's harder to do with the controllers than the keyboard and mouse.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
I got used to it pretty quick. And it is really sad that I really don't have connection problems on the 360 whatsoever.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
I have none of those loading problems or delays or any of that shit that you get with Origin.

22:23.000 --> 22:30.000
And it's so refreshing. And I had some characters unlocked on the 360 prior that I just really missed, like my Korean engineer.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
So Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect, Mass Effect. Lots of that.

22:33.000 --> 22:37.000
Other games, though, besides Mass Effect, believe it or not. LittleBigPlanet Vita.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
I played some more of that. I mentioned I touched this game a little bit last week, but I didn't really play a lot of it.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
I got to play some more of it this week, and I'm overall pretty satisfied with it.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
A lot of what I said last week still holds true. It's a lot of the good stuff from LittleBigPlanet 2.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
However, I finally figured out why the game wasn't bugging me about the online connectivity when I was playing it last week.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
Because the game has an online pass, and I hadn't put in the code yet.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
And so when I finally, because, you know, you have to beat the entire first world before you unlock the moon and the community levels and all that.

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
So once I unlock that, it's like, oh, hey, you need an online pass. It's like you need to enter in the code from the manual.

23:18.000 --> 23:24.000
And I'm like, there's no manual with LittleBigPlanet 2. And I started like, oh my god, did I get ripped off?

23:24.000 --> 23:32.000
But I opened up the box, and there was a code there for, it said, the costumes from the Bioshock characters.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
Like, it said, congratulations on your pre-order bonus for Big Daddy costume and all this stuff.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.000
And I'm like, wait a minute, that's not an online code. And I'm like, I'm going to put it in anyway.

23:42.000 --> 23:46.000
Sure enough, it was the online pass code. I put it in and it said, you've unlocked the online pass.

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
And I'm like, great. So if I didn't think to try that, I would have thought, they didn't send me one.

23:52.000 --> 24:00.000
So, just a heads up, if you bought your copy of LittleBigPlanet Vita and all you have is a code for a costume, it might actually be your online pass code.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
Just throwing it out there. So, there you go.

24:03.000 --> 24:11.000
That was LittleBigPlanet Vita. I do like some of the enhancements they made to the online community stuff.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
You can download levels now, so you don't have to, like, go connect and find them every time.

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
Some of the levels online are really stupid, though, but that's to be expected with any creation game.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
You're only going to find a few gems in the haystack.

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
But, yeah, as far as execution, it is what you would expect on a little Vita screen.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
And for that, it's pretty awesome, I gotta say.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Something else I played on the Vita. It's only a demo, and I don't like to review games based off the demo.

24:40.000 --> 24:48.000
But after Shane's strong words last week about how he felt about Silent Hill Book of Memories, you know I had to go download the demo.

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
And so I played the entire demo, which was a good, I don't know, it was like the whole first level up through the boss.

24:54.000 --> 25:00.000
I didn't hate it, but it's really not Silent Hill.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.000
Like, it is a dungeon explorer crawler game with Silent Hill graphics stamped on it.

25:06.000 --> 25:15.000
And so, like, if I were obsessed with the lore and really into the storytelling, as Shane was talking about on the call at the end of last week's show, I could see where that's offensive.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.000
Like, having Valtiel be the quest giver at the beginning of the floor, some of that stuff's really hokey.

25:22.000 --> 25:32.000
But I didn't hate it. I wouldn't pay 40 bucks for it, but I would totally rent the game for a weekend just to beat it, because I was kind of interested in where the story was going.

25:33.000 --> 25:42.000
Because it was very like, you are the main character, and you're doing all these things, and I liked kind of the haunting memories that were playing on the TVs and all this stuff.

25:42.000 --> 25:52.000
So, I was kind of into the story, so I didn't hate it as much as Shane did, but I get why people aren't into it, because it's not really Silent Hill.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I wouldn't play it after that description.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, I could bring it out here and show it to you, but you'd probably be like, eh.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
I don't want to blow infected snot all over it.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
All I had to do was look at the back cover and I was like, nope.

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
I don't think it's that bad, but it's not Silent Hill. That's really the best way I can describe it.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
One other thing I'll quickly say, Smart Glass came out for Android devices.

26:16.000 --> 26:21.000
So I'm sure many of you have checked out Microsoft Smart Glass, because it's on all the Android devices.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
And here's where me having an iPhone and Alan having an Android device comes in handy.

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
So we got out his Galaxy 3 and downloaded Smart Glass to it, and I was playing around with the Xbox on it.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
Eh. What's the big deal?

26:35.000 --> 26:39.000
Nothing. It really doesn't do anything right now that the app didn't do before.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
I seem to remember the existing app would allow you to control your Xbox.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
How did you use it with Dance Central?

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
I did use it with Dance Central 3, and the only thing you can do so far, at least that I found out, to be fair, I gave it like two minutes.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
But the only thing I figured you could do is queue up songs in party mode.

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
Alright, I guess that's cool. If I had eight people over, that would be kind of cool.

27:05.000 --> 27:12.000
To be fair, that's all that Just Dance 4 kind of used the Wii U gamepad for.

27:12.000 --> 27:18.000
Remember, that was one of their big things. Hey, you can queue up songs!

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
But, you know, it was just a big deal. I can swipe on the menu.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
I'm almost positive the existing Xbox app that was out there would allow you to remote control your Xbox in the same way.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Like, I don't think that's new. I really don't.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Yes you can.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
So, and then we're waiting for the TV and movie stuff, but none of that's in there yet.

27:37.000 --> 27:42.000
So it's like, okay, they've got the framework for Smart Glass down, now let's see you use it!

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Coming in 2013. Usefulness.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Well, it's just like, was it, um, the Xbox Vision Camera!

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
We've got the framework in place, now let's see the one, two games that are gonna use this.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.000
Yes, you can make a user icon out of your face. That's about the most that vision camera's good for you.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
That's all I really use that for.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Can you do, you can't do that with Kinect either, huh?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Yes you can.

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Oh, can you? Well then, so much for the vision cam.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Yeah, it's obsolete.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
Alright, uh, that's it for, uh, gaming week for me and for our other hosts.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Let's talk about housekeeping and then we'll get into the news this week.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
Uh, housekeeping. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Uh, follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
We have an interview next week. We haven't had an interview in a while.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
Uh, this one is for the old school listeners.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
As you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a show about music-based video games

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
and for a long time we were pretty much exclusively about like the DDR and BeatMania and music game community.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
So it's pretty surprising to me that in our ten and a half year history we've never had this guy on.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
Uh, we may have had him on like for five minutes on one of the E3 specials

28:54.000 --> 29:00.000
but we are going to properly have on the show next week, Eddie from BamaniStyle.com

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
is going to be on the show talking about what, you know,

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
especially because we have a news story tonight about like DDR's reboot and all this stuff

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
and I'm not going to spoil too much about that.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
But we really want to get his thoughts on kind of where the music game community is going

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
because I'll tell you this, Eddie obviously has a lot of love for the Bamani community

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
and a lot of the stuff that he did was a lot of the stuff that many of us dreamed about.

29:25.000 --> 29:30.000
He had the Uber website. He started this record label thing or this record distribution thing

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
where he was shipping out a lot of the music.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
He got some of these artists to come to ASEN.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
He's really been intimately involved with a lot of the music gaming like today.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
So getting to pick his brain on a lot of like music gaming and his thoughts is going to be a lot of fun.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
So this is going to be a fun episode next week.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
Eddie from BamaniStyle.com will be here.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Sounds super.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I know. And it's live. So you guys will be able to ask him questions.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
So make sure you're here in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
That is next week, November 4th, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
All right. I think that's all I have for housekeeping. Yeah.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
All right. Let's get into the news tonight. Loki, start us off.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
So G4 has finally canceled the last two bits of the old G4,

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
which would be X-Play and Attack of the Show.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
And even Attack of the Show is not that old, but, you know, last bit of gaming, I guess, to the network.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
And they will basically run until the end of this year.

30:29.000 --> 30:36.000
And then they're going to have kind of a look back at the best of and then their final episodes and that's it.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
And then G4 has will be wiping itself of gaming, I guess.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
And apparently the rumor is that the channels was this shift towards like a guy network.

30:47.000 --> 30:54.000
They're saying it's like Esquire or GQ channel, which sounds very boring, but cool.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
I wonder where Cheaters reruns and Cops reruns fit into that, but we'll see.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Well, to the news that these shows are leaving, this is all I have to say on the matter.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And that's all, folks.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
I like the scream. The scream really does it for me.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
That was a really good particular Bugs Bunny ending, wasn't it?

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
It's sad, but it's not like we all didn't see this coming.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
It was the merger that was the beginning of the end.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
I was going to say, without sounding like a heartless bitch, it's really not sad either, I'm sorry.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
But, I mean, the biggest talents behind these shows both already abandoned ship.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Sessler left X-Play and Kevin Pereira left Attack of the Show.

31:51.000 --> 31:58.000
And I'm sorry, that show was already done for me the minute they started calling it Attack of the Show and it was no longer the screen savers.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
I mean, that's when that show was already over.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
And X-Play was good when it was on Tech TV, when it was called Extended Play.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
I miss Tech TV so much. It's just like, that was the most awesome network ever.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
And then it's like, hey, G4 sounds pretty cool.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
And then they mixed them together and it's like, whoa, this is like the best thing ever.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
And it went so downhill from there. It's just like, I don't even understand how that's possible, but...

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, AcidicVampire in our chat says,

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
Oh, I thought you were going to play a RuPaul sashay away clip.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I wish I'd thought of that. Next time, next time.

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
The SEG in our chat room says, man, I wonder what the people who have G4 tattooed on them think.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
I forgot about that. They were doing that on E3, weren't they?

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
I don't know.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm pretty sure they were at one point.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.000
They're like, they better pay for the removal.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
Well, look, and here's the thing, especially judging off the Twitter reaction and all this stuff this week,

33:00.000 --> 33:06.000
like people were like, I'm so sad that these shows are leaving and man, G4, there's no video game thing on anymore.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
And all this stuff. And I'm like, you guys are...

33:09.000 --> 33:13.000
People still have their same presence at E3.

33:13.000 --> 33:20.000
You guys are remembering these shows from three years ago back when you were actually watching them.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
If you all were actually watching them, this news would not be coming because it's all about ratings.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
If they hadn't changed them, people would have been watching them.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Oh my God, the new guy on X-Play was fucking annoying.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
I don't... See, I don't even...

33:33.000 --> 33:39.000
I watched the clip. They had a clip of something. I don't even remember what it was about, but it was fucking annoying.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
The guy was a total asshat.

33:42.000 --> 33:49.000
Raginator in chat says, personally, I love the shows. Those shows were the reason I subscribed to cable in 2008.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
A lot of people kind of reminiscing on the older G4 stuff.

33:52.000 --> 33:58.000
And yeah, you know, it's unfortunate, but the network was already over several years ago.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.000
Remember when they started showing reruns of Cops? Hello. I mean, come on.

34:03.000 --> 34:07.000
The first downfall was the murder.

34:08.000 --> 34:15.000
And I want to really know where the financial status was that made the merger necessary.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
Well, according to Black Wolf in our chat room, and he was pretty intimately involved in the early days of G4,

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
and he talks about that on his own show, but Bobby's in chat and says, Paul Allen got tired of tech TV.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
That's why he sold it to Comcast, even though they were about to have positive ratings for the first time.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.000
So somebody just threw their hands up and said, I'm kind of over it.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
I'm curious. A lot of people talking about the E3 coverage.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
You know, for some people, that's all G4 is now, is E3 coverage,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
because they have done the live stuff from the show floor and so on.

34:45.000 --> 34:49.000
So does that mean the tiara goes to Spike TV by default?

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
They've already been doing that. Spike TV was live streaming all the coverage through game trailers,

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
their partnership with game trailers.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
Weren't they like across the street? Oh, okay. They were actually in the...

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, they were doing all of the press conferences.

35:01.000 --> 35:09.000
So Spike had a thing going already. Lately, they've been more of a gaming network than G4 was.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
G4 kind of tried to branch out a bit of like trying to do the whole geek thing,

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
and like, you know, oh, hey, here's some quirky stuff about movies,

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
and it was just, it wasn't working. I don't know.

35:21.000 --> 35:28.000
But I think Spike's all right. They've got, and it's kind of funny,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
you know, if they're going to be shifting to this like kind of guy channel thing,

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
that's kind of what Spike's already doing right now, sort of.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
I mean, they're not really doing the GQ stuff.

35:39.000 --> 35:46.000
They're kind of taking more of the lowbrow route to that kind of, you know,

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
shows with big-titted women and, you know, stuff like that.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
You know, Thousand Ways to Die or action movies.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
The thing that I found surprising, however, amongst all this,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
is that with the cancellation of these two shows,

36:00.000 --> 36:07.000
that means there is one show on all of television cable that is about video games,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
and it's that show that Jeff Keighley has on Spike TV where, you know,

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
have some Doritos and Mountain Dew with your game trailers TV.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
Yes, exactly. You have some Doritos and Mountain Dew with your game trailers.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
But it kind of surprised me because, you know,

36:20.000 --> 36:26.000
I thought video games were supposed to be like the modern version of movies or music,

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
you know, some new art form.

36:27.000 --> 36:31.000
And we have tons of shows about movies and TV shows and music.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
Entertainment Tonight, Access Hollywood.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Who watches Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Old people.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
People that are old.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Grandma.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.000
That don't know how to use the internet or just don't care to watch the internet.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
But not to say that that's necessarily a bad thing.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
And they could have shows like that because, I mean, hell,

36:49.000 --> 36:53.000
there's people that work that have locked down internet at work

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
or they're working like some place that doesn't have internet

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
or that's open and they can look at this stuff.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
And then they can get kind of like a quick feed of, you know,

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
what's coming out and, you know, what the news is and stuff.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
But unfortunately, the gaming demographic,

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
a lot of those people are just like internet crazy.

37:12.000 --> 37:16.000
And so the news travels a lot faster on the internet

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
than obviously these shows can pick up on.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
But it doesn't mean that they can fail.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
I mean, a lot of these shows, if they have,

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
and this is kind of the whole thing with game trailers, TV is,

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
they make a lot of news because they get a lot of exclusive interviews

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
and exclusive trailers and stuff like that.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
You're like you're going to see it first on that show

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
before you, you know, see it on the internet.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
That's where the key is to running a successful kind of

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
entertainment business, at least as far gaming stuff.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
I mean, look at Game Informer, same thing there.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
That's how they were able to kind of, other than, you know,

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
coming free with, you know, subscribing to GameStop's card.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
But a lot of their stuff is, you know,

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
they leverage these interviews and exclusives and stuff.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And so they're the kind of the source of news.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
And I also have to say their magazine actually is pretty well designed.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Let me go to the chat room because of course we are the show

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
where every gamer has a voice.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
And sometimes those voices want to, you know,

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
set us on a different path here at live.vognetwork.com.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Black Wolf wants to point out that Electric Playground

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
and Judgment Day are still around.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
You might know Judgment Day as reviews on the run.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Electric Playground is in syndication.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.000
A lot of ABC affiliates on the weekends right now.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
So I guess for me to say that Game Trailers TV is the only video game show

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
left on all of television is a falsity.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
So sorry for that.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
I guess you could say on all cable because syndication doesn't really hit cable.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
What would syndicated Electric Playground have anything to offer?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
Like I don't really give a shit about a review of Halo 2 or something like that.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
Well, I would say it's the equivalent of Ebert and Roper.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.000
Although I don't even think that exists anymore.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
But at the movies or whatever they call that.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
You know, what's the point of that show?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
It's reviews on movies.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
So why not have a show that's review on games?

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
I get it.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I don't think it's any different than the Roper or Ebert stuff

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
from five years ago.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
So that's the niche it's filling I assume.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
TigerConChat says, old people watch those shows.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
Young people, they watch things like TMZ.com for all the entertainment news and gossip.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.000
TMZ is kind of trash though.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
You know what I do?

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I look at your Facebook.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Here's what I want to know.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
What's happening to...

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
Oh, Black Wolf thinks...

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Oh, I didn't get this.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
Black Wolf thinks that you missed the point that these are new episodes.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
These are not syndicated old stuff from G4.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
These are new episodes.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
But it's like Baywatch was a syndicated show when it was new and all that.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
So these are new things.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
Sorry about that.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
I didn't catch that.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I thought you meant to say Halo 4.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
Well, if it's new stuff, then that's alright.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah, it's new stuff.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I remember watching Electric Playground.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Tommy Tallarico is still doing that stuff?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
I believe so.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
I think it's still him and that other guy.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Victor... Victor...

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
They're kind of annoying.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
But I do respect Tommy Tallarico.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
But yeah, one of them was really annoying.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
I just can't remember who.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
I don't think it was Tommy Tallarico.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Well, you know, but then the same thing.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
Some people think Ebert was annoying or Roper.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
I don't know.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm sure a lot of people think I'm annoying.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Yeah, that's right.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Let's see.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
What else is going to bring up?

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Oh, the TMZ.com bit.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
TMZ is kind of a trash thing, though.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
I mean, let's be real.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
All TMZ runs is trash.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
And it's the type of stuff that, you know, gets posted on Facebook.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Like, oh my God, Lindsay Lohan with the intervention.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Da da da da da da.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
I'm surprised.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
Real quick.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
What?

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
What the fuck is up with her playing Liz Taylor?

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
I was just about to ask, so where is our trashy gossip site about video games?

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
Who is the Perez Hilton of video games?

40:47.000 --> 40:50.000
But then Jamie has to go and open her mouth and say that.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
So I'm thinking maybe it's us.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
We just saw Victoria post about it.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
We can be your trashy gossip site.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
It made me cry.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
There's just not enough gossip in the game industry.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
It's just, you know, we can make up speculative rumors about things,

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
but I don't think there's really anything like that.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
No one cares about, like, gossip.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Just they like rumors.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
What are you talking about?

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Nobody in video games cares about gossip.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Are you high?

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
That is all people ever talk about is gossip.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
No, they talk about rumors.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
Okay, that's the same thing.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Where did Cliffy B go?

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
That's gossip.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Cliffy B went to Nintendo.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
I have a friend who's on-

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
Cliffy B went to go bang his wife, okay?

41:35.000 --> 41:36.000
That's where he went.

41:36.000 --> 41:44.000
The Wii U is causing all this turmoil within Nintendo and blah blah blah blah.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.000
That's gossip.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
What do you mean the video game?

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
The video game press thrives on gossip.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Yeah, but it's not like celebrity gossip.

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
I mean, I'm saying that you can't, there's not as much content out there for,

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
I mean, celebrity gossip, there's people stalking every celebrity out there.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Someone's gonna fuck up, you know, once a day or at least once an hour.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
So are you saying that there's no celebrity in the video games industry?

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Not big enough.

42:09.000 --> 42:14.000
So why did we just talk about how Reggie Fils-Aime looks like a wax figure?

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
There is two celebrities within video games, absolutely.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
So let's start stalking him and find out how Reggie Fils-Aime double parked today.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
Woo hoo!

42:23.000 --> 42:30.000
No, there's a difference between the A-list of standard celebrity, you know what I mean?

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
And then there's a difference between the A-list of geek celebrity,

42:35.000 --> 42:43.000
where we might care more about, like, say, what Wil Wheaton put on his blog,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
because honestly, he's a really good blogger.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
How many of us can really give a shit about Lindsay Lohan?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm not raising my hand.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.000
She was in Mean Girls, and that is one of the best movies ever.

42:55.000 --> 43:02.000
But my point, you know, who cares how many more kids, you know, Brangelina adopted?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Don't give a shit. They can afford it good.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Let them raise all those damn children.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Don't care.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
But I do care, you know, if, oh, well, so-and-so developer left whatever, you know, company,

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
and that means no more of this, or he's gonna be, that's shit we care about.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
You know, and that, and we do care about D-list celebrities like Kathy Griffin.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
I think you're right, though, about the nerd celebrity thing.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Like, and I'm reminded yesterday, this is a big deal for Understation Live.

43:29.000 --> 43:36.000
Jessica from Understation Live, Iguana girl, she got her question read by Felicia Day in some live chat,

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
and basically had this reaction, you know, because, you know, Felicia Day is pretty cool.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
And like, even, you know, the geeks on her friends list were all going,

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
but you know there's people on her friends list that aren't in the whole geeks culture.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Look at that and go, who?

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
Well, you know, I've met some famous people before, and I was just like, oh, hi, how's it going?

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
And I completely geeked out when Wil Wheaton answered a question on Twitter.

44:01.000 --> 44:07.000
I completely geeked out when I met wrestlers back when I was into wrestling.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
And I had my moment earlier this year because I told everybody I knew that I got to shake Latrice Royale's hand,

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
and like, you know, I met Latrice Royale and she was gorgeous and all that, and everybody's like, who?

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
And I'm like, it's a drag queen, hang my head in shame.

44:23.000 --> 44:31.000
Or my autograph from Kondo Koji or the other Koji, Igarashi.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
Remember the picture that you took of me with him at E3?

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
I do.

44:35.000 --> 44:43.000
I was like, and first of all, he was pretty floored that my horrible Japanese came across, you know, understandably,

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
but still it was, it was, and you know, running into Kojima three years in a row, literally.

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
Stan in our chat room says everybody's, or excuse me, everyone's idea of a celebrity is different.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
That's a very, that's a very good point because I really got to address this topic carefully

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
because I really don't want to sound like I have ego.

45:01.000 --> 45:08.000
But I was very humbled and thankful that when I went to PAX East a couple of years ago, I did have people that like came up to me.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
And like, I had like a group of people that just came up to me and was like, are you Rob?

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
You're Rob from Los Angeles, aren't you?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
And I was like, oh yeah, I am. Hi, you know.

45:17.000 --> 45:22.000
There was some random guy at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza, you know, who wanted to talk to us.

45:22.000 --> 45:29.000
Which is, and I was like, oh my God, that's like, it was like as much of an OMG moment for me as it was for you, I'm sure.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Or it's like, you know, I'm like, oh, people like actually do listen to this show.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
It's kind of a humbling moment. It's pretty awesome.

45:37.000 --> 45:45.000
So anyhow, Stan in chat says I made Latrice Royale in PlayStation Home.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
Got a lot of weird looks. Actually, you should just tell him to eat it.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
I'll tell you when it was Miss Freaky for me was when I went to Alabama a few years ago.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
And they were doing attorney in Biloxi. I think it was in Biloxi.

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
No, it was. It was. Yeah, I think it was in Biloxi.

46:03.000 --> 46:09.000
But anyway, I showed up for some DDR tournament on a fifth mix machine.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.000
And because it was their new fifth mix, they were all happy and we'd had it for a while.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
But, you know, it was all cool. And they're like, you're here.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
You said you'd be here and you're here. And I was like, hi, everybody.

46:20.000 --> 46:30.000
Nice to me. And then I went to like some 2DX party on a widescreen TV and had to play Karaoke Revolution.

46:30.000 --> 46:41.000
And it was pretty fun. But I mean, it's at the same time, though, it's I prefer it more when it leads to making friends with people.

46:41.000 --> 46:47.000
No one cares about. I'm sorry, Loki. But you're a shut in, too. You don't go out as much as Jamie and I do.

46:47.000 --> 46:54.000
True. You know what? Our listeners are my kind of people. Most everybody else in the universe.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
I'm like, don't touch don't don't touch me. Don't talk to me. Our listeners.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
I'm like, OK, you're allowed to touch me on the arm. All right.

47:03.000 --> 47:09.000
Dave Falcon in our chat room says, I met the nature boy, Rick Flair, in a bathroom in a bar in Tampa.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
And I asked him for his autograph. I hope he didn't do that when he was paying, because that's a little awkward.

47:13.000 --> 47:22.000
Like there's there's time to talk to people. Sign it with your urine. I have his DNA.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.000
That reminds me of this scene from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, about Abba. Never mind. Never mind.

47:27.000 --> 47:36.000
Let's move on with the news. The ESRB, the entertainment rating board, entertainment software rating board.

47:36.000 --> 47:48.000
They are trying to streamline the release of downloadable games, doing a new rating service that is targeted for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, eShop, WiiWare and Windows 8.

47:48.000 --> 47:59.000
This service is no cost. So that's a big like, oh, incentive for people to use this, because, you know, there's a lot of indie developers and people that don't have very big budgets making games for these platforms.

47:59.000 --> 48:08.000
So this is a no cost service. What the deal is, you do an online questionnaire and through this questionnaire, you basically self identify the adult content.

48:08.000 --> 48:15.000
What's interesting about this, the questionnaire will also rate a game in terms of what is shared.

48:15.000 --> 48:26.000
So there's some new content descriptors in the game that will indicate that the game shares information, shares location or interacts with users.

48:27.000 --> 48:36.000
That's pretty awesome. I've got to say, actually, I love this idea. Even it's like me. I love the fact that I will know exactly which games are going to want to share my location.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
Can we see that those ratings on Facebook? I with what they're sharing.

48:41.000 --> 48:47.000
I don't see why it wouldn't work if Facebook games were willing to put it on their Facebook, the website.

48:47.000 --> 48:55.000
Oh, yeah, we should rate Facebook, the website. But that's that's another rating sport that will have to do that.

48:55.000 --> 49:01.000
Apparently, this is very similar to what PlayStation mobile games already have going forward on the rating system.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
Some are saying that could have been inspired by that. So very cool.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
I love that it's no cost. Let's just hope everybody's honest in those questionnaires.

49:10.000 --> 49:17.000
I'm almost positive there will be a story in the near future about a game that is missing one of these labels that should have had it.

49:17.000 --> 49:23.000
But we'll see. It's an interesting step forward for now. So I can't see how this is a bad idea.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Looking forward to it. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us? It's new.

49:29.000 --> 49:41.000
You know what that means? More Bimani. So, yeah, Konami has announced that the newest DDR game is just called Dance Dance Revolution.

49:41.000 --> 49:48.000
And they haven't put a whole bunch of details about it, but they're doing their first location test at Tokyo Leisure Land.

49:49.000 --> 49:54.000
Is that next Friday? I think it is. It's already already happened. Yeah.

49:54.000 --> 50:01.000
So, yeah, there's a location test page and everything up now, but is it supposed to do all of its updates of the Internet?

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Yes, some of the tweets were indicating that like that.

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
I guess they're calling it Dance Dance Revolution because they're not envisioning that there will ever be a second mix or a third mix.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
There's just going to be one mix that can be constantly updated. Yeah.

50:16.000 --> 50:22.000
Actually, there's a quote on here from So In Love about future DDR series.

50:22.000 --> 50:31.000
I talked with Uson and they named this version as just DDR because they will update it, but no new versions.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
And I think that's an Engrish-y post, but still. So they say now.

50:36.000 --> 50:43.000
Well, you guys were all longtime DDR fans. That's the game that brought us together.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
So obviously, I'm sure we all have opinions on this. Loki, what do you think about a new DDR?

50:48.000 --> 50:55.000
I think it's stupid. And I mean, they tried the same thing with the console version and we saw how well that worked out.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
It tanked and they said, oh, but we're going to provide lots of DLC for it.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
They provide some DLC and then it's done. Nothing.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
You get the game dirt cheap now and there's no DLC support for it.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
So, yeah, I see that totally happening with this where they're going to have some DLC for it.

51:13.000 --> 51:18.000
And here's what I want to know is if they're going to constantly update this game, then how are they going to sell new games?

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
They just don't want to make profit off it anymore or they're going to sell DLC to arcades.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.000
So you're gonna have some arcades that have these extra songs and some arcades that don't have these extra songs or.

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I think that's how it would have to work, a selling DLC to the arcade.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
I kind of think it's a great idea. But remember, this is Japan. This is not something that's being tested here.

51:37.000 --> 51:44.000
This is a very Japanese centric thing. And for a Japanese arcade where you have karaoke boos that, you know, have their own songs and what have you.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
I could actually see this really working. And yes, I think it would give arcades some identity.

51:48.000 --> 51:54.000
They tried it with Tekken, I want to say, was one of the games that they're going to have DLC for that arcades are going to pay for or something like that.

51:54.000 --> 52:05.000
The problem is, though, is like it was so they basically kind of excludes all of the other territories other than Japan because a lot of these can't connect to emus.

52:05.000 --> 52:13.000
So they're going to be stuck with basically the default song list, which may not be a bad thing, but it's just kind of what's the incentive?

52:13.000 --> 52:22.000
You put out things that aren't specifically Japan licensed for that first release, but all the DLC will have Japan only licenses.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
You know, that's what I see happening.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Jamie, what do you think about a reboot of DDR?

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
Why not? I mean, really, I'm kind of like, but I'll play it.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
I mean, I always play the new stuff when it comes out, but I kind of hit a point where I stopped caring.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
I'm good for them. I hope it works.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
Let's be honest. They've rebooted DDR like four or five times already.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
I honestly think Konami doesn't understand what makes DDR good.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
And so, you know, with Extreme, they remember we're starting all over again.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
And then they had Supernova, and that was kind of another reboot.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
And then they have the X series, which is kind of a reboot.

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
They did three games into that, and now they're rebooting it again.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
I mean, it's like, do you guys not know what fucking makes these games good?

53:08.000 --> 53:16.000
Is that it? You're just kind of like, well, we're just going to draw straws here until we figure out why this is selling, you know, or why people are playing it or not playing it.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
They had a strong formula for a while, and people were excited, and then they changed it.

53:21.000 --> 53:30.000
Which I think that that might have been, you know, because, I mean, keep in mind, how long have the guitar freaks in Dramania still been going on?

53:30.000 --> 53:35.000
How popular is pop and music still? Pop and music is way popular.

53:35.000 --> 53:42.000
And just because they've kept their formula. They haven't kept trying to redesign it. They haven't tried to reinvent it.

53:42.000 --> 53:51.000
And that's what I think the problem they're doing with DDR is that they've gotten away from, they're trying to make it edgy, trying to keep it new, but really it's that quirky classic that people like.

53:51.000 --> 54:00.000
I'm kind of with Jamie on this. I'm like, you know, and I've said this for years when we were mostly music-based, is I said, you know, DDR really does need to reinvent itself.

54:00.000 --> 54:10.000
And I don't think any of these other, I don't think Supernova or X really were a reinvention whatsoever. None of it really did anything to push the franchise forward.

54:10.000 --> 54:19.000
So I'm a little bit hopeful that if they have to go back and put in this infrastructure to support DLC for arcades and all that, maybe they're going to approach other ideas for the game as well.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
Like something to make it a little more competitive or some of this new stuff.

54:23.000 --> 54:34.000
I mean, I think a creative reboot would be a great idea, but I don't know if that's really what we're getting with this game, but kind of like Jamie's saying with her point, it's better than nothing.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
I'm like, well, sure. Why not? What the hell?

54:37.000 --> 54:47.000
But this whole stance of like, well, we just don't see it. We don't see us making another DDR game. So you're giving up is what you're saying is where you're going to support it with songs.

54:47.000 --> 54:57.000
And if people are interested in the songs and cool, you'll keep releasing them. But let's put it this way. If they're not charging for that DLC, then what's the real incentive for them to do it anyways?

54:57.000 --> 55:03.000
I mean, because they're not helping themselves. I mean, they're not going to sell any more games.

55:04.000 --> 55:14.000
If they are charging for DLC, then it all comes down to how much is this stuff costing? Because obviously in an arcade machine, we're not talking like $5 song DLC.

55:14.000 --> 55:19.000
We're talking probably like, you know, a couple hundred dollars or, you know, whatever for these songs.

55:19.000 --> 55:29.000
And if arcade owners back there, you know, if that's going to be worth it to them, because adding a few songs to machine might not necessarily get more people playing.

55:29.000 --> 55:39.000
I mean, sure. It'll be like, oh, hey, there's new songs unlocked. That was kind of the case with Max 2 and Max and stuff where it's like, oh, man, we unlocked a new song. Let's come on down, play this new song. It was really cool.

55:39.000 --> 55:49.000
And it kind of got people wanting to play it because they're working towards unlocking something. And now the way they have it is where it's just like, oh, you get a code and it unlocks something.

55:49.000 --> 55:57.000
And then now, you know, it's basically all on this stuff. And then now they're going to have this instead of it being a code, they're going to push an update.

55:57.000 --> 56:12.000
This is sort of what I was talking about a lot earlier with Tekken 3. Because people, when Tekken 3 came out, I worked at a Namco arcade and we had people always coming in saying, how many more matches until we unlock somebody?

56:12.000 --> 56:21.000
You know, even though I think they were all on a date cycle, you know, who's the next person? Well, in Japan, they got this person. We must be different here, which they ended up being different.

56:21.000 --> 56:34.000
And, you know, that worked for DDR where you would unlock things. And I really wish that they would go back to something like that. I mean, if they're going to do DLC updates, it just still be unlockable stuff.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
You know, to keep that excitement, to keep people feeling like there's a sense of achievement that it's a community wide effort.

56:42.000 --> 56:59.000
That was always the best part about Max 2 was that community part. So I'm all for that. I will withhold judgment until I actually get to play it, which may not be anytime soon if recent DDR releases are any sign, but I hope for the best.

56:59.000 --> 57:04.000
What else can I say? Let's move on with news. Loki.

57:04.000 --> 57:14.000
Yeah. So let's see. Let's talk a little bit about the Wii U. And honestly, this news doesn't surprise me at all.

57:14.000 --> 57:26.000
So the rumor is that the Wii U is not going to launch with all the features on the system. Kind of sound a little familiar with Nintendo's kind of M.O.

57:26.000 --> 57:45.000
Apparently they're seeing right now that the features, including Miiverse and the near field communication, that they won't be on the actual system. You're going to have to download Miiverse in order to actually have it, which kind of seems a little odd to me.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
Wasn't that supposed to be what you see when you turn on your Wii U?

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Yeah.

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
That's weird.

57:53.000 --> 58:02.000
And I guess, you know, obviously later on, they're going to add some other support and stuff for multiple game pads and that kind of thing, which makes no sense right now because no games use it.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
But and even the near field communication stuff doesn't really make any sense to have that right now because nothing uses it.

58:09.000 --> 58:18.000
But Miiverse is a little weird that that wouldn't be on the actual console because I don't know.

58:18.000 --> 58:28.000
They're saying that it won't be it's possible that it won't be available at launch because considering third parties can't access it right now.

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
So hold on. Let me let me get this straight.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
How are they going to have any games incorporated?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Exactly. Let me get this straight here.

58:35.000 --> 58:41.000
So they have this thing that's supposed to tie into these games, but no games can tie into it.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.000
In fact, it's kind of funny if that's true, because third party games can access it.

58:45.000 --> 58:50.000
The one of the big games that they showed this whole Miiverse thing was with Zombie U.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
So that was all bullshit that they were kind of pushing our way.

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
I mean, I don't know.

58:59.000 --> 59:06.000
I think it's kind of retarded that you have a Nintendo system launch without like all the features in there.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Like, remember the 3DS?

59:07.000 --> 59:08.000
Where was the Web browser?

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Oh, it didn't come out until months after.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
It's like, what?

59:12.000 --> 59:18.000
I mean, you're selling me this broken piece of shit that you're going to patch in the stuff later on.

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
Why don't you delay the release a little bit and have some actual, you know, have it done?

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Why bother pushing this out when stuff isn't done yet?

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Or I don't know.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.000
This is a main feature of the console and you haven't fucking finished it yet.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
It's not that complicated of a piece of software.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
But it is all rumor.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
It's all rumor.

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
I mean, Miiverse could be also one of those things that they're going to, quote unquote, patch in day one.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Like, it could be one of those things that they're really working right up to the last minute.

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
I mean, I'm totally theorizing just throwing it out there.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
Miiverse is one thing, but the other stuff you're talking about?

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Okay, near field communication.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Big deal if that's not there.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The whole dual Wii U.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
No, that I don't expect to be.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
We know that's not there anyway.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:10.000
So, I mean, I do like, I have to say, as much as this opinion may not be popular,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
there's been other Nintendo stuff in the past where they slowly unraveled things.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Like, I seem to remember the original DS and the whole, like, downloading demos and all this.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
That wasn't there when the system first launched.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
That was something that came up later.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And the whole internet connectivity.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And it was like, that feature was just waiting in your DS the whole time to be enabled.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
So if there's stuff like that that we don't yet know about that's kind of hiding and waiting in the Wii U,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
that's kind of cool, I guess.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
No, it's not cool because a system, a modern day system should have the ability to play demos.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Just like the Wii, you know, oh hey, we're gonna have an internet browser.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And it didn't fucking come out until later on.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And then they're, oh, well, we're gonna do this.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
We're gonna have this internet browser come out now.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000
And, oh, maybe later on we'll have a way that you can store things, you know,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
on your SD memory card instead of just backing up your saves on it.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Or, oh, I don't know, how about we just, you know, have a feature now where you can download digital copies of the games.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I mean, they're so far behind.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I mean, all these other companies have been doing this for a long time.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And it's just like they push it out to their customers like, oh, look at what Nintendo's doing.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
We're offering demos of games.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And everyone's like, fuck yeah, that's amazing.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
This is awfully new technology.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
It's like, no, it's been fucking done for years now.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
They were doing demos on the PlayStation 1.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And yet, for some reason, Nintendo's unable to give you a demo of anything.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I think Nintendo's big thing is that they've been trying to avoid anything that's going to damage,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:48.000
not necessarily their reputation or their brand, but avoid ways for pirating,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
avoid ways for region outsourcing, not outsourcing is not the word I'm thinking of,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
but going outside the region, avoiding incidents for online chat.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:05.000
They're really, really trying, I think, way too hard to preserve their brand.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And they're sacrificing a lot of the options that people have come to expect from a modern-day gaming system

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
for the sake of that little neurosis, I guess.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Well, let me get into this next story because it's almost right up the same alley of what we've been talking about here.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And this really caught wildfire all over the internet because Origin, the ever-popular EA service,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
updated their privacy policy.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And this has a lot of people wondering, how exactly does Origin play into the Wii U?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Because in the new policy, it says, quote,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
By signing up to play EA's titles, you agree that limited user account information can be transferred to EA.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Information transfer to EA includes your Mii information, email address, Nintendo Network ID,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
friends list, country, language, and date of birth.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
So this seems to confirm that Origin will be a part of how you're going to play EA games on Wii U.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
But my thought is, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Because before we start saying, oh my god, it's going to be Origin on the Wii U, which would be dreadful news indeed.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
If I were to see that Origin logo pop up on the Wii U, I'd be like, it's over.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Nintendo did not convince me, they understand online, this is done, I'm done.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
But, hold on a minute, because EA and your Origin account, they also interact with your Xbox 360 account and your PlayStation 3 account.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
And your Wii.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Oh, and your original Wii, that's right, they do.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And all of that kind of interfaces in that EA console when you go on there.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So, I mean, like, hopefully this isn't much different.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I don't think it's any different.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Especially like, okay, maybe it just wants the Wii information, so put your little picture on the Origin account or whatever.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
But I don't think that's a huge deal.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Some other people are learning out of this.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Make sure you haven't done penis face.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Yeah, to also draw out of this, the Nintendo Network ID is seemingly telling, that's a huge part of it, that where's the friend code.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So maybe they finally are doing some type of universal ID.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Is that an ID name that I get to pick, or is that a Nintendo Network ID number?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I don't know, we shall soon see.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000
So, of course, all the big blogs reaching out to Nintendo for comment, but they're not saying anything right now.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I wouldn't panic, I don't think this means it's Origin on Wii U, at least I hope not, because Origin is terrible.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And it will be a terrible thing for the Wii U.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
If that happens.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They would never do that.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Like, I would not buy Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U if it has the Origin tie-in, there's literally no point.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Well, it's definitely gonna have Origin, Mass Effect 3 on the Wii U will have Origin, but, yeah.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
But in what capacity? I mean, on the Xbox 360, you don't see it.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's just like the Xbox 360.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Okay, that's fine then, because what it's doing, it's talking to Origin's servers to get your galaxy information and get some of that stuff,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
and update your stuff on the EA social BioWare site or whatever.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
That's fine, because the connectivity isn't happening through Origin.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
But if on the Wii U, the connectivity is happening through Origin, that's gonna be a huge problem for me, because it stinks.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:21.000
It's horrible. I mean, I never had a problem with Mass Effect 2, even though it registered all my stuff on Origin.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I still played it through Steam.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Well, technically I played it on its own because I bought it on Amazon.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But I ran it through Steam.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I never had a problem. It wouldn't connect to the servers right when I loaded it up, but I could log in.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I'm not even getting the option anymore with my Mass Effect 3.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Which, if it was the patch, I'm just saying.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
But I think Origin has something to do with it too, even though I'm connecting just fine through Origin.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
So, they just need to get their shit together.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Alright, well, unfortunately these are things we just aren't gonna know until the Wii U actually comes out.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So, meanwhile, more news. Dark Sakura.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Well, hopefully something better than freaking Origin.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
How about Super Mario 64?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Sixteen years, this game, since this game has come out.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
My husband and I used to play a crap ton of it.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Well, now there is a PC mod for Super Mario 64 that lets you play co-op online.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It was modded by Skelux? S-K-E-L-U-X?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
At least it wasn't Skelux.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Seriously.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Because then the Mario theme would be...

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And then it would be dial-up noise, the game.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But it's Super Mario Star Road, which is a site dedicated to Mario 64 mods.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.000
But this one keeps the level design and everything, but makes it co-op.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You're not playing as Luigi, though, however.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You're playing as sort of a recolored Mario.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I mean...

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Luigi.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
But it's not like the taller...

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
It's like a gray Mario, gray and red Mario.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So, kind of like a palette swap.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
But hey, it's cool.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I actually want to check this out.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Oh god, Tigerclaw in our chat room is telling me,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Rob, it's been done.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
No! No!

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
It's the internet. Of course it's been done.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and some video games that are coming to a store near you,

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
hopefully with less dubstep.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Well, we've got a few games coming out this week since we're in the fourth quarter.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So, let's start off.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
They're doing some re-releases of stuff.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
They have the Namco Museum DS and Pac-Man World 3 bundled together on one DS cart.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So, that's coming out.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Also Tekken 6 and Soul Calibur IV are bundled together on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We've got Assassin's Creed III on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and on PC.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Thundercats on the Nintendo DS.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Transformers...

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Wow.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Hey, it's probably based off the new Thundercats series,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
which is probably not that good.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Thundercat... or Thundercats.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Transformers Prime, the game on the Wii, the DS and the 3DS.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Also Nike Plus Connect training on Xbox 360.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Need for Speed Most Wanted on PS3, Xbox 360 and the Vita.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
That's kind of cool.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Maybe a Vita game I can actually play.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Myst on the 3DS.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Moshi Monsters Moshlings Theme Park on DS and 3DS.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Toy Story Mania on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Those are kind of HD redos of the Wii game that came out.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The Trash Pack on DS and 3DS.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Zone of the Enders HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Let's see, moving on here.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000
We've got the Rockstar Games Collection Edition 1 on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Includes Red Dead Redemption, Midnight Club Los Angeles,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000
the Grand Theft Auto episodes from Liberty City and L.A. Noire for 60 bucks.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That's not a bad deal.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Bratz Fashion Boutique on DS and 3DS.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:36.000
And WWE 13 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and the Wii.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Lala Loopsie Carnival of Friends on DS and 3DS.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Winx Club Magical Fairy Party on Nintendo DS.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Wreck-It Ralph on Wii 3DS and DS.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And let's see here.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Marvel Avengers Battle for Earth on Xbox 360 for Kinect.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And then, oddly enough, only the portable versions of LEGO Lord of the Rings this week on the DS, the 3DS, and the Vita.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And Need for Speed, most...

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Or, I didn't mean Need for Speed.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I think that might be it.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Oh, and a PC version of LEGO Lord of the Rings this week as well.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Oh, Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation on the Vita.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Can't forget that one. That's actually supposed to be pretty good.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Smartass on the Vita and Ragnarok Odyssey on the Vita as well.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
So that's it for this week, I believe.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:47.000
On November 1st, Medal of Honor Warfighter on the Xbox 360 and NBA 2K13 gets its Japanese release also on the 360.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Going to the PlayStation 3, Dead Island, Zombie of the Year Edition, Medal of Honor Warfighter on NBA 2K13.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Okami Zekke Kaiban, this is the HD remaster of Okami, is finally out on the PlayStation 3 this week.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000
And Tales of... Are you supposed to say Zilia or Shilia? Because it's an X.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Exilia? I think it's Tales of Shilia.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I think it could be Zilia.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Zilia? Alright, whatever. Tales of Zilia 2 is out this week.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
And there's even a version that comes with a new DualShock controller and all this stuff.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I think Xylophone, Rob.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.000
All these different little limited editions coming with that, so that's pretty exciting.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
That must be a major holiday release in Japan.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Nothing on the Vita this week, really.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And just checking the 3DS real quick to see if we have anything there.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
A black Nintendo 3DS XL and then one that has Monster Hunter 3G as well.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Oh, World Soccer Winning 11, 2013. There you go, soccer games.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
That's it for Japanese releases, Dark Sakura.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Ah, I just dropped my yarn.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Oh, noes.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Hold on.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
As I had the list up.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Coming out on the 30th, we have Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation for Vita.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Sorry if I sound weird, I just took a cough drop.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
31st, Assassin's Creed 3 for 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Sports Champions 2 for PS3.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And now I have to move on to November's dates.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Stupid thing.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
November.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
On the 1st, we have WWE 13 for a number of systems.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000
On the 2nd, Football Manager 2013, Just Dance 4, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Nike Plus Connect Training, Silent Hill Book of Memories.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That's it.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Alrighty.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Just a few more news stories for you guys, then the classic game of the week.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
What did Dark Sakura pick this week?

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Find out after two more stories.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Loki.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Well, it's unfortunate that we have to report on more closures and layoffs.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But Zynga has laid off 5% of their workforce.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Kind of a restructuring that they're doing.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
They let go roughly 3200 employees.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And with that, they've closed Zynga's Boston studio.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000
And also, the studios in Japan and UK are being kind of slated for shutdowns soon.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Also, the Austin office, they've laid off quite a few people there.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And they've also shut down, I guess, 13 of their older games.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And what they quote, significantly reducing their investment in The Ville.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Probably a good thing being since, you know, they're being sued by EA for The Ville.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
So, it sounds like the outlook on that is not too favorable.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
That's kind of disappointing.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
You know what Dan told me?

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:57.000
He said that their stock right now is lower than Radio Shack.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Ouch!

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Alright. I got one more story for you too.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
By the way, that was shady that they did that during the whole Apple conference.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Like, a lot of people assumed that was intentional.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Maybe it really wasn't.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Just to give Zynga what little shred of doubt I can,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
maybe that actually wasn't intentional that they did it during the Apple conference.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Because seriously, how are you going to hide something like that?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
You think the internet wouldn't notice?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Come on.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I think it was just a coincidence. I really do.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
But it really didn't make them look good, that's for sure.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Windows 8 came out this week.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I don't know how many of you guys are excited about Windows 8.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Can I quote a movie?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
What?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Whoopty shit.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Well, you know, I don't know. I'm trying to judge my Facebook.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Some people went and got it the day it came out and they're actually really excited about it.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Like, they're really enjoying it.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
So, I don't know.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I'm going to give it a couple months before that whole super sale's done at the end of January to see if it's something I really need.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But, I bet you're dying to know.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
What about the games?

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
What are the games that come with Windows 8?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Well, let's tell you about the new games with Windows 8.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Microsoft Solitaire Collection is one of the games in Windows 8.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Which, of course, it's Windows that's got to have Solitaire, right?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Remember, these all have achievements and stuff, too.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:23.000
There's, like, Klondike Solitaire and Pyramid and, you know, all the stuff you'd be used to.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Minesweeper is back in Windows 8.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
But, here's the crazy part.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Minesweeper now has an adventure mode.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
What?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000
No one, Kerr.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Look at the screenshot.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It's like little explorer dude going through the cave.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Yep.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Hey, you know what?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000
As much as you say no one, Kerr, I got to say it looks better.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Mr. Driller did it better.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Whatever.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Other games within Windows 8.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Microsoft Mahjong, which I think they've kind of been including ever since, you know, Shanghai.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
The old PC game was popular.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
I love Mahjong.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Wordament is a new game.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And this is your basic, like, boggle clone.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
There's a lot of word games like this that exist there.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
The game also exists on Windows Phone 7, just so you know.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Tap Tiles is another game that's included in Windows 8.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And lastly, a game called Adara.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000
It's kind of got like a little story that goes with it.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000
A stone and sorcery magic type game, but it's more like a puzzler.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Don't get like a, you know, I don't know.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
But, yeah, it's like a very simple type of adventure game.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
So, that's another free Windows 8 game.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
So, there you go.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
We've come a long way since the days of just good old Solitaire with the bouncing card when you finish, right?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
You know what, Rob?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
The moment that you said that, my brain instantly went to like a Virginia Slims ad.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
How so?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000
With like gamers, you know, sitting around making shit faces at, you know, Windows 8.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And it has, you've come a long way, baby.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:03.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, work.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Alright, let's travel back to when Solitaire was all you got.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
A classic time in gaming's past.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Dark Soccer is going to open up the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you, listen, classic game, play, now.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Classic game of the week is Panzer Dragoon, which I thought that I had done it before, but I had done Saga or RPG as we got it.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Or as, I'm sorry, as it came out in Japan.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
So, Panzer Dragoon is a rail shooter by Team Andromeda.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
It came out on the Saturn in 1995.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000
And then later on, there were other versions for PC, PS2.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And it came as a bonus in Panzer Dragoon order on Xbox.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:02.000
So, you basically play as Kael Fluge, who is unnamed in the US version.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
And basically, you just go through and you shoot stuff.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
But the game's freaking gorgeous.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:17.000
I mean, people gave the Saturn shit for its 3D, and yeah, it didn't do 3D as good as the Playstation did.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:24.000
It was built originally as a 2D machine, but this game really illustrated what you could do with the Saturn.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
So basically, you have machines and monsters as your enemies.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And it's sort of like a post-apocalyptic fantasy world.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So you have to go through, you've got the different boss battles that actually pause the game before the boss battles.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And then you have X and Y axis that you can move across on for those boss battles.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But basically, you can look all the way around.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I mean, your enemies are coming from everywhere, but you're still on rails.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
So you've got two weapons. You have a handgun.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And then you have a homing laser that your dragon fires.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
It has six levels, each one about five minutes.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
And then there's a boss battle.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And the sixth, though, is a special boss battle.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I have to say that, just going back into this one.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Now, I played a little bit of it, but you know how I get with certain games.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I'm with Emotionsick. This is one that made me Emotionsick.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000
However, since this was a Sega game, of course it was out on the Saturn.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000
It started off, though, as a different project.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And they said that they were trying to develop a shoot-em-up game.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And it eventually evolved into Panzer and Dragoon.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So, yeah, pretty awesome game.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000
But they were under a big time frame for actually developing it.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And the original name of the game was actually Kikuryu, which is armored dragon.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
But they wanted to pick something that sounded a little bit more exciting.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
So they picked a German name, Panzer and Dragoon.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And there you go.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
That's it?

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
That's it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
What a pretty game, though, especially for its time.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
That's a gorgeous game.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Well, it was actually named the best Saturn game of 1995 by EGM.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
RIP.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And this game also sold well enough that they could do Panzer and Dragoon's V.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Which, of course, is keeping with that German naming.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000
It was also one up, give it a retro review of 8 out of 10.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So, not bad.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Alright.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
There it is, Panzer and Dragoon, your classic game of the week.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Good pick, DarkSakura. Good pick.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Well, thank Dan.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Alright, good pick, Dan. Good pick.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Alright.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I was like, what should I pick?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You can bring Dan back to the show. We have a fourth mic now.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Thanks to the kind, benevolent people at Pod Culture.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
If you have Dan all the time, then it's not special.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
You must like my life. I mean, wait.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Alright.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
That's going to do it for part A.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
But don't go anywhere. We have a very busy part B when we come back.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
We're going to do some rapid fire news.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
The Fugu question of the week and listless.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
We are live on this Sunday evening, October the 28th of 2012,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
with the 479th episode of our show.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Getting into part B and we'll be doing some rapid fire news

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
and the Fugu question of the week and a special listless tonight.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000
But first, we have some breaking news to start off part B.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Breaking news.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000
The eighth annual podcast award nominees are in at podcastawards.com.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And we got nominated!

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Orange Lounge Radio is a nominee for Best Gaming.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
And there's ten shows in the gaming category,

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
including a couple that also got some bigger nominations

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
for People's Choice and Best Produced.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
So it's going to be some big competition this year.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And unfortunately, kind of on the downside,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
a lot of these are corpcasts this year.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
I soon remember last year it was all indie podcasts.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
And there are some indie podcasts in this list.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Like, I recognize Gamertag Radio is a great show.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Minecraft Me, I think, is indie.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
I don't know where some of the...

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I imagine The Independent Characters is one, too.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
So there's some other good shows in the air.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
So we want one of the indies to win.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Obviously, we would really like it very much if it's us.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
A specific indie to win.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Yes, we very much want this specific indie to win.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
However, if we can't, we really hope one of the indies takes it.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So good luck to the indies in here.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
As far as the corpcast goes, you're going down.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
So podcastworks.com.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Power to the people, yo. Power to people.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
The Daily Voting, and I don't know all of those shows,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
so I apologize if you are an indie show and I did not name you specifically.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I will do more research before voting opens on November 1st,

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
is when the voting opens.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So there you go.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:49.000
We will be trying to whore for your votes like crazy come November 1st,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
because we are going to need them.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And you can vote every day.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Yes, you can vote every day.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So we will be reminding you every day. So please help.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Remember, we don't ask for money.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
We don't ask for, you know, subscriptions.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
We don't have a plus feed or something that you pay extra money to get.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000
All we want, we want your votes to help us spread the word.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm not saying that, you know, obviously we want legit votes,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:15.000
but they do allow one vote per email address.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, Rob, aren't you torn that Horde House did not get nominated?

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Actually, it's much easier this way,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
because then I only have to champion for one show to get votes,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
because that would be weird if the other show had gotten nominated.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.000
I did notice it was interesting that the instance wasn't nominated,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
because I know they've been nominated almost every year,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
so maybe they didn't go for it this year. I don't know.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Also, Four Player Podcast, they've had the lock on this thing for, like,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
three, four years, because they have a huge fan community, and they're very rabid.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
They were not eligible this year.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000
That's why they're not nominated, because they won the biggest of the big awards last year,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
and there's some weird rules.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So, they'll be back next year, guaranteed,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
so if there's any year we actually stand a chance in hell to win,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.000
it's going to be this year, so please throw us your votes come November 1st.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
There you go.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And, unfortunately, I also have to say this,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
no other VOG show nominated. I looked.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I was a little depressed, because I know I nominated some,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
but I guess it was just a lot of competition or what have you,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
and we were whoring the nominations quite a bit,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
so hopefully we were able to catch some eyes there.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000
But we're going to do our best to represent VOG and try to win it for us.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Like the whores we are.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So, there you go.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Thank you guys very much for helping that happen.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I really, really, really appreciate it, and lots of celebratory stuff in chat right now.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
I appreciate it.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
A City Vampire says,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Will you pay me to vote for you?

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
We'll pay you in hugs and kisses.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
We are not like the presidential nominees, hello?

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
We don't pay people for our votes?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Taiki says,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Fuck the podcast awards after irreligiosophy got snubbed twice.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Well, you know, I've kind of had some give and take feelings about the podcast awards,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
because let's be real, it is a huge popularity contest.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
However, it's great promotion.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I'm not going to lie, it's great promotion, so we've got to do the best we can.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
So there you go.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news, some quick gaming news for you guys.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Loki, start us off.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:31.000
So if you like collectible figures, there's going to be some new vinyl figures coming out from Funko Pop.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000
They've got some Halo 4 figures, very chibi looking.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
They've got Cortana, and it looks like Master Chief.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And a couple other of the Spartans, they've got a red Spartan and a blue Spartan.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
So those should be coming soon.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
I'd get a red one, but make him purple so it could be Donut.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Or pink.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Yes, that'd be pretty cool.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
And I'm sure you could, you know, paint your own Spartan if you want to.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
But I believe those are going to be available soon if they're not already available.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I mean, they've got to be probably available now since Halo comes out in a week.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So, man, it's already a week? Crazy.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Oh yeah, that's right, because it's election day that it comes out. Crazy.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Wow, election days are right around the corner.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And then all this bullshit will be over.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Where is my melee?

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I got mine.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I got mine like two weeks ago.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Okay, so Team Fortress 2, they're doing some fun stuff for Halloween.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Of course, Scream Fortress is coming back.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And what would come with your staple Halloween thing?

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Why, of course, zombies. Zombies would come.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And they've got different events going on, including haunted King of the Hill matches.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Also, they've got, I guess, a game, or was it, Bombinup Con?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And some wizards and stuff. It's all, of course, you know, Halloween themed.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And they're going to have a brand new man versus machine mission called Wave 666.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Which will have undead robot enemies.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So, neat. And I'm sure there's some unique cats to be had there, because why wouldn't they have unique cats?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:39.000
And then, not to be outdone by Just Dance 4, but Dance Central 3 will also be getting Gangnam Style as well.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And that should be coming pretty soon.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Also, call me maybe.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Uh oh, Loki. Uh oh. You know what you said, didn't you? You said it.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:03.000
It came on my radio, I said last week.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
It's like Pee Wee's Playhouse. Whenever somebody says the secret word, you just have to start, you just have to get down.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I love that gif that's out there, by the way, of the football player that's getting down doing the Gangnam Style dance.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000
They're seeing other artists that are going to be coming soon.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Justin Bieber, One Direction, LMFAO, and um, yeah, that's all they've mentioned so far.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Did you hear about the hacking of Justin Bieber's Twitter?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That was fucked up. Oh my god. That was so fucked up. I am sorry.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
That was amazing.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
It's one of those things you're laughing at and then you're like, oh my god, I'm going to hell for laughing at this because this is terrible.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Alright, repeat it for those that may not have heard.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:53.000
So I think it was Fortran people that did it hacked Justin Bieber's Twitter and posted that he had cancer and was going bald from his treatments.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:02.000
So all these girls started shaving their head and posting little signs that said bald for Bieber.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.000
That is messed up. That's hilarious.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Just goes to show the whole, you know, sheep thing, you know?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000
That's hilarious. And then they're probably disappointed when he's not really dying from cancer.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Alright, let's move on.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Going to news about the Commodore 64. Yeah, you heard me. Commodore 64.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Super Crate Box is a game that's been out there and it's turned 2 this past week and they did a free iOS version to celebrate.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:40.000
However, what's awesome, they're doing a game called Super Bread Box that's going to be an adaptation of the game on the Commodore 64

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000
by the guys who did C64 Cannibalt.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:53.000
So there's already a YouTube out there. This is going to be available, they say, in early December.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Check out that awesome soundtrack.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000
God, the C64 was so great.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Flamethrower.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Every game needs a flamethrower.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
A brand new website launched this week that has a lot of people excited.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Polygon.com finally officially launched this week.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And it's notable because there's a lot of game journalists, like people that were big on Joystiq before and Kotaku before and some other websites,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
that kind of all came together to form this website.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And I saw a lot of people on Twitter that were kind of spazzing about the website launching.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And, you know, it's a nice looking website.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I don't know. Jamie, have you seen this website at all yet?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.000
How do you feel about their design choices on this website?

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Because I actually didn't, I mean, I like the writing, and that's the important part.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
So I want to get that clear.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It is really easy to read, but I like when it scrolls to a point and that, is that Skeletor?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Yes. Here's what I don't, I don't like these images that suddenly take up the whole horizontal, intermixed with these vertical things.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
That's the one thing I really don't like.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:05.000
The other problem with that being too is that you're going to deal with different resolutions and this is clearly optimized for max resolution.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
So it's not going to work for everybody.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Right. The mobile site's really good looking though. I will say that.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
So congrats to them for finally starting this, but I am going to say one little thing.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I am going to dog on this here because, you know, we do that.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I don't get the whole documentary and making of stuff.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
That, that's a little too much ego for me.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
A little smug.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
It is a little smug. It's very smug.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And I, you know, all these little documentaries about the launching of the website and the making of the website.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000
No one gives a fuck except for you.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
That shit should be organic.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:41.000
That's, I mean, this feels like forced and it makes me not want to like your website.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Like to be, I'm just being perfectly honest.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Now I do like the writing and I like, you know, a lot of the people that are there and ultimately that wins out.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.000
But I got to say all that self-serving bullshit is kind of unnecessary.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000
That'd be like hosting an awards ceremony where you're going to award yourself for being so awesome.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I mean, I'm sure that's right around the corner.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Polygon's awards for Polygon.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
The, the others.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And realize that we just told people to please go vote for us in an online award ceremony, but I'm sorry.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yeah, but I don't have a fucking documentary about, yeah, like let me start a new website.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I'm going to create a documentary about starting said website.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:31.000
The, but really to go back to this though, is that their design, I like, I like consistency.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:39.000
You have to have consistency with a good website and with it switching back and forth, you're really not giving it enough consistency.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Plus you're, you know, you're sacrificing memory for people who may not be optimized to use your, uh, your site.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
I prefer it to keep a constant format.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I like the large splash image up at the top and then the site going into it.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I like the three column your, uh, point of view.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I just think that you need to pick a style and stick with it.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Um, but at the end of the day, of course the writing is the most important and they do have some really interesting in-depth articles.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Writing doesn't do anything if you can't find shit.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Snap.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.000
All right.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Uh, let's move on to one other quick thing I want to get out here.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Uh, Jason, one of our, um, co-hosts, we sometimes have a guest host here on the show and our lovely webmaster of orange-on-street.com wanted me to plug this.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And to this I say, but of course.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Uh, how many of you are fans of the website GitHub?

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:33.000
GitHub's a pretty awesome site for, um, developers, programmers, and, and basically nerds.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Let's be, let's be honest.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000
It's a super nerd site.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Well, uh, GitHub is going to be doing a game jam of their very own.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Uh, there you have the entire month of November to create a web-based game and it's got to be loosely built around one of these themes.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Forking, that's forking like a spoon or a fork, or forks.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Branching or branches.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Cloning or clones.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Pushing or pulling.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
What do we mean loosely based?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
They mean loosely based.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Like, you could do a first person shooter where you throw forks and so on and so on.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Some of the prizes.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Shiny new iPads with retina displays.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Ooh, ah.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Uh, GitHub swag and so forth.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:20.000
And, you know, featuring on the GitHub blog, which considering that this is a pretty popular website with nerds is, uh, probably reward enough in itself.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And, uh, some, also some, uh, FaceTime in front of some pretty, uh, great judges here.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.000
You have the CEO of Garage Games, co-founder of Lost Decade Games, et cetera, et cetera.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
So, uh, check that out.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It's called the Game Off and it's, uh, featured at github.com.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
I know you said Game Off, but for a moment I thought you said Game Moth.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:47.000
I was thinking of this little moth with big rainbow wings flying around to, uh, Abba.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Awesome.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
All right. Well, that's all I have.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Dark Soccer, what's up next for you?

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I have more stuff.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And a voice that's failing.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Um, Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition is coming out for PC for 1990.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Um, it has Warp Zones.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Yeah, Warp Zones.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Then, um, there is a, uh, uh, nine minutes of footage up for the Mass Effect 3 prequel,

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000
uh, which is, uh, Paragon Lost, which I think I'm like the only Mass Effect fan that's really excited about this.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000
So I don't know.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000
I'm going to check it out.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
It's Vega. It's about Vega.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
But, oh, hi, Marco.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Um, so, uh, you've got Freddie Prinze Jr., you know, playing Vega with his, you know, not very good, you know, Spanish.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
That's loco.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Um, but it should be, uh, the actual DVD and Blu-ray will be out on December 28th in the US.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Although there is not a date, um, on, uh, for the UK yet.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Give it time.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
So, yeah, you can find the footage out.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And then, um, there is a, uh, Halloween bundle, um, from Indie Royale.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Um, it has, uh, Sam and Max, The Devil's Playhouse, the full season.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
It has a home.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.000
It has Pathologic, um, McGuffin's Curse, and Evil Quest.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:30.000
And if you, uh, pay over $8, you also receive, um, a flak or MP3 copy of C. Jeff's, um, chiptune album, um, Presh Tale.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
So there it goes.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
You know, I was hoping that McGuffin's Curse, I kind of read that as McGruff's Curse.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I know.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Take a bite out of crime.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It's a, it's a noir, a film noir game starring McGruff, a crime dog.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Whatever happened to McGruff, the crime dog?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000
I think he got replaced with something more hip and young.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Cause, you know.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Dude, McGruff was cool.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
What could be more hip than McGruff?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
I don't understand.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Uh, I don't know.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
1981.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Let me take a look at this.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Good lord.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
Look at this. I love you, YouTube. Here we go.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000
You know what I think? I think you forgot to lock your door.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
A lot of people do that. They forget.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
That's too bad because all crime needs is a chance.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Don't give it the chance.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It's my job to teach you to protect yourselves.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Make it your job to learn.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Write to Box 6600 Rockville, Maryland.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Oh, and one more thing.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Lock your door and take a bite out of crime.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.000
I don't understand, like, that was a commercial on TV.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Lock your damn door.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000
When I was a little kid, we actually didn't lock our doors that much.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I guess that's true. Growing up, you know, and it was different times.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And especially if you lived somewhere a little more rural, there's still a lot of places like that.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
I didn't live somewhere rural. I lived in the suburbs.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
But there's a lot of places still like that.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
That they don't lock their doors at night.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
And, you know, McGruff would like you to take a bite out of crime.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Oh my god, they had the drinking and driving commercial on there with the two beer mugs.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That was awesome.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000
That used to be my favorite commercial because it was like breaking noises and beer.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
They had a McGruff the crime dog monster truck.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Rama in chat says, I remember when McGruff the crime dog came to my elementary school.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Did he take a bite out of the principal?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Stan says he was fired when they found a dead prostitute in McGruff's car.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Oh, well, that answers everything. Thank you.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
It's always the dead prostitutes.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
They find themselves everywhere.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
God, they ruin everything. Damn those dead prostitutes.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Alright, let's take a bite out of the Fugal Question of the Week.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Why, you take Facebook and you take Google Plus and you sandwich them together and you get Fugal.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
It's the Fugal Question of the Week.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And, you know, with all the hurricane stuff going on in the world,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
they have me thinking about storms, knocking out the power and all this.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:09.000
So, the Fugal Question of the Week, available at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and our Google Plus community is,

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000
tell us a story about a time when game over came too soon.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
In other words, have you ever had an experience where you were really into playing a video game

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
and then suddenly the power went out, the internet went out,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
a parent came in and turned off the system while you were playing.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
How did you react?

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Alright, well, I'll get to the host in a minute.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Yeah, something just popped into my head.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Let's start with act-deaf.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:37.000
I remember one night when playing Outrun on XBLA on Bobby Blackwell's Friday night gaming show.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
I got the game on the last minute and got into the last race of the show.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I was kicking ass when suddenly my connection dropped.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I seriously was pissed as hell, especially since I was bragging how good I was at racing games

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
to have that happen in the middle of a live stream.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
That's what you get for talking all that smack.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Alright, let's see.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Panaxium answers the question.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.000
It says, for me, it was Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I was trying to beat that obnoxious final boss for over an hour.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.000
When I was finally about to beat the damn thing, my dad gracefully trips over the GameCube cables,

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
yanking the power out of it.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I remember doing Evader-style, no!

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.000
He looked at the blank screen a few seconds, then turned to me with a big dorky grin and said,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
sorry, I'm prone to power trips.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
That was horrible.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
That was some punishment for the show.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And Panaxium ends it with, thank you so much for that, dad.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I'm prone to power trips.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Let's see.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Going to Facebook to get some of the questions here.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Let's see.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Brandon H. answered the question and said,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
just unlocked everything in Guitar Hero 3,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:06.000
then in the middle of saving the power went out and then it came back on,

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Red Ring of Death and Corrupted Saves.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000
That was a really bad day, to have your machine Red Ring of Death on top of the power failure

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
and corrupt your saves.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
That sucks.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Let's see.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Joe G. answers on Facebook and says,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
oh, excuse me, I used the wrong name.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
So you have to put it at the beginning or I might miss it.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Haseo Sumeruagawa says,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I was playing Borderlands.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
I was on Mad Moxie's Underdome Riot and I was playing the last arena there

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
and was about three quarters of the way through

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
and I had finished all other quests from the games and Zombie Island is rolling.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I died, got booted out and I played the whole thing offline, mind you,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
so when I died I was shit out of luck

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000
and what the fuck did the autosave and power flipped off,

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
corrupting the save data and I think people in Texas heard me yelling obscenities.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Burr replies,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Growing up I always remember getting kicked off the computer mid-game

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
because my mom wanted me to take a break and go outside.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I always end up spending my time away from the game thinking about what was going to happen next

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and it would continue on to the next day during school.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.000
You can physically separate a gamer from their drug, but you can't keep it out of their mind.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
James S. replied and said,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
When I was about six years old I was playing Yoshi's Cookie on the original Game Boy.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
That game was awesome, just saying.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I love that game on the SNES.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
You're marked that for a classic game some week because I love Yoshi's Cookie.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Out of frustration on a high level I proceeded to rage

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000
and I slammed the Game Boy against my head, causing the screen to shatter instantly.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Keep in mind I was six. I've never been so mortified yet satisfied in my entire life.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Ouch. Have you ever, like, has your rage ever broken something that was like several hundred dollars like that?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Dan, back in the day, would break controllers.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:07.000
And one time he took a controller back, he bought a new controller and then returned the controller,

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000
except he returned the broken controller.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
I think it was like a Saturn controller.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Wow.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Ronnie B. answered and said,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
When I first moved to where I am now the breakers would trip every day,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
often erasing hours of my Civ progress on the 360.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I also hate when broken games, often downloadable games, glitch so badly the only option is to restart

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
due to locked menus, stuck cameras, or whatever.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
SSJ100Matt with an arcade answer. I like this.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Back when I used to play a lot of Initial D in the arcade during my college years,

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I once lost my entire record and stats for my main car in the game.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I was in the process of transferring my data from Initial D2 to Initial D3 and the machine errored out

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
and my card got jammed inside the machine.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Since my Initial D2 card was already voided because of the transfer, I lost everything.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Several months worth of work on my main car was gone forever.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Needless to say I was frustrated, but after it happened I quit playing Initial D.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.000
All the work that went into building that one car and then losing it got rid of my inspiration and drive,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
pun intended,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
to play the game anymore then.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Let's see, I'm going to do one more answer here.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Hitstun says,

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
A few months ago I was at KDB in Columbus and saw a couple of guys playing the Tekken 6 machine.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
They finished their match, I asked if I could play winner and they let me join in.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:38.000
At the character select screen I put in my card with my character on it and the cabinet froze.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
The other guy was not too pleased and he asked,

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Did you do that on purpose? Why did you have to end my game?

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I felt terrible. Maybe my card got corrupted somehow and I just ended a good play session between friends.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Eventually I had them follow me to go track down an attendant so we could both get refunds.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
The Tekken 6 cabinet eventually rebooted but neither of us went back to play it again.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Those are some good answers and I didn't read everything, I apologize,

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.000
but go check out the rest of the answers at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or our Google Plus community.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Let's go around the room and see if anybody has things to share.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Dark Soccer, I know you said you had something.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:19.000
When I was in high school my little brother Matthew got hit by a car.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.000
He was six and that night basically I got dropped off at the mall with my best friend Jennifer.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:34.000
We went to the movies, we went to the arcade because basically there's like here's some money.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I ended up getting in on a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game in the arcade.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
This was the first time I'd ever played a full four player game.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
They had me on Leonardo so I was like okay he's kind of cool.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:54.000
We got all the way to the end of the game, had just got the last hit, and they shut off the machines.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.000
We were all like noooooo! It was pretty bad.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Loki, can you think of a story? I have one while you're thinking.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I don't have a lot of good ones but do you know how old NES is?

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.000
He had to blow on the cartridge to get him to work and then sometimes the game would just spontaneously reset.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Like right in the middle. Yeah, that happened to us the night my friend and I decided to play Super Mario Bros. 3 from start to finish with no warping.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Around like world six or seven. Like if something hit the ground too hard, which I think is what happened, I think we dropped something on the ground.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And it just threw everything off balance enough so it was like, reset!

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Noooooo! Everything was ruined and we gave up and moved on. Loki?

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I don't really have anything that I remember as far as power outages and stuff like that.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:54.000
The only thing I can remember is that I was making a pretty awesome level or game in ZZT.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000
And I had it backed up to a floppy disk and then the whole thing got corrupted.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:06.000
And all that work, it was like a month worth of work and it was just gone.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
What happened to me on The Sims House?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Can we take a moment to remind our listeners of the mutual love we have for the game ZZT?

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I wish there was something like that again.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
There's still Megazooks that's still out there.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Do they still make stuff for ZZT?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Megazooks, yes.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Oh, right.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
The new one.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:24.000
That's amazing.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Anyway, sorry Dark Sakura. He said the magic word.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I one time spent four hours working on The Sims House and forgot to save and then the power went out.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
We should have a VOG ZZT contest.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I've thought about it. I seriously have.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
You and I would be the only ones that would enter.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Yeah, unfortunately.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
You know what? Prove me wrong.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000
If there's interest in a ZZT VOG contest, email the show and tell us you're interested and you'd participate.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
And we will put something together.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Alright.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to listless tonight.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
But first, Loki.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
So, the PS3's been hacked again.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Sort of.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Basically what happened was a hacker group called the Three Musketeers finally released the level zero keys.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And not necessarily the way to get those keys themselves, but the keys will be useful as far as decrypting new firmwares that come out.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
And basically re-encrypting them in the 355 keys to run on hacked consoles.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
So, really there's no way to block that.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
They did kind of, if I remember correctly, they updated the keys on certain PS3's and stuff now where they use like the 0.2 keys or something.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
They're slightly different.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:50.000
So, I think that's why it has to run on the 355 firmwares because anything newer doesn't use those keys anymore.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:57.000
But, you know, for compatibility's sake they need to have everything, you know, use those keys at some point or something.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I don't know.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Honestly, it's been so long since I've looked into the hacking stuff.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
It's, I don't know.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:18.000
But, apparently, this is supposed to be un-patchable as far as they can keep using this exploit to forever have custom firmwares on PS3 and run, you know, new games and stuff like that.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000
So, that's kind of interesting.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000
But, we'll have to see, you know, if that's actually going to happen.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:30.000
But, as of right now, they haven't really released any new firmwares.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:40.000
Although, I have to really, I have to double check that because I think, I want to say I saw something about a custom firmware 4.3 come out.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Let me see here.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Debug firmware 4.25 has been leaked.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Let's see here.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
What's this?

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Homebrew for custom firmware 4.21.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Update the DMCA.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
So, what does this really mean? Is this going to be like rampant piracy on the PS3 now?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:21.000
No more than it already is. It just means that they're going to keep, they're going to be able to keep doing it.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Gotcha.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Alrighty.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Well, I think you'd have to, I would say you have to have, I think, a firmware that's like 355 or lower.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Which, I don't remember what mine is right now because I haven't updated in a long time.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000
So, I don't think I'm 355. I think I'm newer than that.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:49.000
But, you know, if you have an older firmware then that means that you'll be able to, you know, they'll translate the old ones so that they can run like a custom firmware on those.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Or based off those.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Well, you know the old saying we have on the show, hackers gonna hack.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000
And, but at least no personal information stolen, right? It's not that kind of hack?

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Not that kind of hack.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Okay, because like, you know, a lot of people were, I think there's some misinformation out there because people were saying, did it get hacked again?

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Like, oh my gosh, PlayStation got hacked again?

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
So, it's not that kind of hack, right?

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Yes.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Alright.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Well, I'm going to get into another story here on a completely different note.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:29.000
This is something that has me very excited and I want to see if this is something maybe a few of you out there can recognize by the music, which I love the soundtrack to this game.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Anyone recognize this?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Actually, if you played this game as much as I did, you probably heard this song a lot more.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:49.000
It's the music from Shadowgate on the NES, but of course Shadowgate existed on some of the early Apple platforms as well.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And they did a version of it on Game Boy Color, right?

01:52:52.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Well, get this, Shadowgate is being reimagined and it has a Kickstarter behind it to get it funded.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
This is a reimagining of the point and click adventure classic Shadowgate.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000
The original Mac release was in 1987.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, I apologize if I'm mispronouncing that.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Dave Marsh and Carl Roloffs, they worked on the original Shadowgate with Icom Simulations 25 years ago.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
They've started this new company.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:27.000
They bought the rights to the old Shadowgate game and Uninvited and Deja Vu apparently.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:34.000
And also got the rights to the 8-bit soundtrack, which apparently was done by somebody completely different.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:40.000
It was done by a Japanese guy who, I guess maybe in the port of the games over the NES, maybe it was done there.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
So if you listen to the trailer for Shadowgate, it has a newer version of that music, which is awesome.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Let me see if I can play a little bit of this for you.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
But yeah, they're doing a Kickstarter for this.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:59.000
It's going to be redesigned puzzles and an expanded storyline, but most of the plot devices from the original game will still be there.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And like in the trailer, you can definitely see the room with the lake, like you used to put the orb in the lake to freeze it.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:11.000
And you can see the room with the dragon breathing fire at the other end, so there's all of that in there.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
So very, very cool that they're doing this.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:21.000
They are seeking $120,000 to do versions for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:29.000
You can do $10 right now to get a DRM-free, and they're really emphasizing that, a DRM-free download when the game comes out.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
They are projecting 2013 November for that, so it is going to be a bit of a wait.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000
But I will say this, this is only the second Kickstarter ever that I've given money to.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I did donate to this Kickstarter because I really like Shadowgate, and I liked those old Icom games, so I'm really excited about this.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:57.000
I will say this though, I only have so much money. I couldn't do the $130,000 or more, but that did sound really cool.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:04.000
An original Shadowgate card game. That would have been kind of cool, but a little bit out of my price range personally.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
But I'm sure there's people already, it's already up to $41,000.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.000
There's that sound again. Let me fast forward. I want to do this part of the trailer here.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:26.000
So you can tell they're totally ready to do this, which is pretty awesome. There's the Wraith. I remember that from one scene.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
So you definitely see stuff from the whole game.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000
The artwork is gorgeous.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Oh yeah.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
I would pay for this just for the artwork.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah, it's gorgeous. ZOJOY is the name of the company that is putting this together, that these guys started.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:48.000
So good luck to them, and obviously as a fan of these games since I was a kid, I hope they do it. I really want it. Very cool.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Let's move on with some more news. One more story, and then we're going to get to Listless tonight. Dark Sakura.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Oh, I do have another story, don't I?

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Yes, ma'am.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Well, how about the game Waking Mars? This one is an iOS ecological puzzle adventure game.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:12.000
It's actually going to be coming out to PC, Mac, Linux, and Android on November 6th.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:25.000
It's a revamped version done by Tiger Style Games, and this is going to have high def with voice acting throughout the game and be just a great big step up from the iOS version.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:36.000
But I mean, this is what was really interesting to me is that they specifically listed Linux among the platforms, which I think is great Linux getting more attention.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:43.000
And of course, a lot of people kind of giving Mars attention with the whole curiosity and all that, right?

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Well, there is that too. But this is a game that I kind of had my eye on to play for a little while, and I just never went back for it.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Excuse me, sorry. But it's a game that was supposed to have really shown off just how great iOS could be programmed.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.000
And I think I'm definitely going to play this on PC.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Sounds good. You have to tell me how it is. I'm waiting for your review before I check it out.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Okay.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:20.000
All right. All right. Let's get to that time, folks. It is time to bring this segment back. It's been forever since we've done it. It is time to play Listless.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:30.000
If you've never heard Listless before, what we're going to do tonight is we are going to create the definitive list, the definitive answer.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:37.000
This is a highly scientific process, the definitive list around a topic. Here's how it'll work, and I'll tell you the topic in a minute.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:41.000
There's going to be four of us playing tonight. We're going to have a special guest join us here.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:46.000
So everybody help me welcome to the show or welcome back to the show, Alan.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Hey.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
How you doing, Alan?

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Good.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:52.000
All right. So Alan is going to be playing Listless with us tonight.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:58.000
The four of us will give our top three answers. That's going to leave us a list of 12.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Then we're going to go around the room and each eliminate one answer.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.000
It's a really tough thing we got to do, but it's part of the process.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
That's going to leave us with a list of eight.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:17.000
And then those of you in the chat room will vote on those final eight answers and help us come up with our definitive list of the top three answers to this topic.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Here it is.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Earlier in the show, we talked about that G4 is losing its last bit of video game programming and that it will no longer be a video game network.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And most of us have thrown up our hands and said, I'm done. I'm out. Later.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Nice knowing you, G4.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:40.000
So tonight's Listless topic, the TV show that would make me watch G4 again.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:46.000
It could be an existing show. It could be a new show. It could be anything you want.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000
The show that would make me watch G4 again.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:59:00.000
If you want to give your suggestions in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com in case an answer should get duplicated or, you know, sometimes we just like the chat answers better than our own.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Make your suggestions in the chat room and we will read some of our favorite answers from chat.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.000
So again, TV show that would make me watch G4 again.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.000
All right, let's go around and start building the list.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So we will start with Loki tonight.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Loki, what is your number three answer for a show that would make you watch G4 again?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:31.000
The brand new Iron Chef series that they're doing, the Japanese Iron Chef, but translated in English.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.000
All right. Now, to be fair, the Food Network probably has a lock on this show, but...

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Not yet.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Oh, not yet.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Well, I mean, it hasn't started yet, so...

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
All right, that's a pretty serious answer.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
I want new Japanese Iron Chef.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
All right, new Japanese Iron Chef. There you go.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Let's go to Dark Sakura, your number three answer.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Show that would get you to watch G4 again.

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Well, first of all, I never actually watched it, but I would go for Real Housewives Disney edition, like on SNL.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:07.000
So like an actual version of that sketch from SNL, the Real Housewives of Disney.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
Yeah.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
That's a good suggestion. I like that.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:17.000
All right, my number three answer tonight, and I see people saying this in chat right now, so chat and I are on the same page.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.000
My number three answer is Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Yes.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Where the contestants who don't do well at the games will actually get electrified.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
I was going to say Nick Arcade, but that wouldn't make sense, because it's Nick Arcade.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:46.000
All right, so so far we have new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, and Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Alan, what would be the number three answer for show that would get you to watch G4 again?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:00.000
A documentary special. We're responsible for Olivia Munn, and we're very, very sorry.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
A five-hour apology special.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Good answer. I'm going to shorten that a little bit to Olivia Munn apology special.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Now, that would only be one movie, unfortunately, or a miniseries. It could be like a miniseries.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
And what things about Olivia Munn should be apologized for?

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Have you seen her face?

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Wow, that's cold. You are cold.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:38.000
All right, so so far we have new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney, Starcade 2, Electric Boogaloo, and Olivia Munn apology special.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Deanna Allers, look at her and go, girl, you need to check yourself.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
All right, Loki, what is your number two pick for the list?

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
The screensavers.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.000
So just bring back the frickin' screensavers.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
That would give me the watch. That network, yeah.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Just exactly the way it was. Don't fucking put new people in it.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Like Leo Laporte, Alex Albrecht.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Everybody that was in there. Do it the same way you did it.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Kevin Rose, Dig Didn't Work Out So Well, Get Him Back Too.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
All right, there you go.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Dark Sakura, your number two answer.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.000
My number two answer is Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Because Glow was awesome.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.000
You want Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I was addicted to Glow when I was a kid. It was a good show.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Oh, this was an old show?

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Back in the day, I had Godiva, the woman who wore the skin colored body suit with flowers all over it.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
And Mount Fuji.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Hated it.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Glow was awesome.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
My mom used to let me stay up until 1am and watch UHF and see the Glow show.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
So I might have to vote for that.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Don't you mean USA? Wasn't UHF like the Weird Al movie?

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:15.000
UHF was a weird movie based off of the alternative band of TV radio that had channels on it, yeah.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
All right, all right.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
My number two answer tonight for a show that would make me watch G4 again.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:27.000
The Days of our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000
There you go. Days of our Citadel, the Mass Effect soap opera.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
You mean the shitadel?

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I can't believe, Dark Sakura, I do not have your support on a Mass Effect soap opera.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.000
What is up with that?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I would watch it.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
There you go, see? You would watch it.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Extra garis.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
All right.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000
If Nickelodeon could have 15 as a soap opera, we can have Days of our Citadel.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000
All right, Alan, your number two answer for the list.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:03.000
How not to market something special?

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:08.000
35-year-old nerds. They're loaded, they're loyal, they're distracted.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Wait, you need to explain this one a little bit while I figure out how to shorten the answer.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
What would this show be?

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
The whole basis of the G4 channel model.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Let's appeal to adult geek, because they have money.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
They play video games.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000
We're going to put shows on TV that they'll want to watch.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
They still buy lots of video games each year, and they're not watching this yet.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
We're confused.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I shortened that to 35-year-old nerd special. Does that work?

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
By the way, you and I turn 35 next year. I just want to point that out.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
There's something sad?

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:44.000
What?

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
My brother, Phillip, yesterday turned 30.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Well, on the 26th, sorry. The other day.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
All right, so, so far, we have on the list new Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney,

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special, The Screen Savers,

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, Days of our Citadel Mass Effect soap opera, and 35-year-old nerd special.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
It is time. The number one answer.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000
The number one thing that would most make you watch G4.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Loki.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Well, I mean, if they're going to compete with Spike, then really there's only one choice,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000
and that is big-breasted bikini car wash.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
And how exactly would big-breasted bikini car wash be a show?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:34.000
It's just women washing cars and sudsing up each other with large breasts.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000
And would Loki get to be a special correspondent that motorboats the boobies?

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I'll be the host. I'll be doing the play-by-play.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Nelly will get to motorboat the boobies.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I would love-

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Or you can just have me, like, you know, in the beginning of each episode,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I'll drive up the car, honk the horn, kind of smile at the camera, and-

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
I would love you and your wife to host a show,

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
because your wife would just walk up to the ladies and be like,

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
how did you let your boobies get so big?

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
You have really big areolas.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
All right. Dark software.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
No, no, no. That's just- that's just shameful.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I mean, they're not going to be topless.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:21.000
I mean, that could be- that could be the whole web series, but, you know.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
The unrated Blu-ray.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I'm finding topless car wash, too, but, you know.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:27.000
All right, big breasts.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I guess it doesn't say- well, they could start off with bikinis.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
All right, really. But then we're getting the Playboy content there.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
We don't want to infringe on the other rights.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:38.000
I'm surprised you didn't do World Series of strip poker.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
That's where I thought you'd be going. All right.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
No one wants to watch poker.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Dark Sakura.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Depends on who's doing the pokin'.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Dark Sakura, your number one answer.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I would actually watch the Angry Video Game Nerd TV show.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:51.000
If they did one.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Because I love watching the Angry Video Game Nerd.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
So you think it's-

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
I love watching his movie specials.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.000
You think it's time for the Angry Video Game Nerd to cross over?

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
I think it's time.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
From YouTubes to cable.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I almost said ScrewAttack.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
But, I think the Angry Video Game Nerd would be more marketable.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Okay, there you go.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Let's see, my number one answer.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
And this is big, you guys.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Every single one of you know.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
That if this show was on G4, you'd be clicked.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I am there.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.000
My number one answer is Loki's Cosplay Challenge.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
I don't understand what that is.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Who am I challenging?

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.000
You would basically go around to different anime conventions

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
and interview people that are cosplay.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
And then the viewers would pick their favorite cosplay.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
And then the challenge would be that you have to imitate it.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Yeah.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I don't think I'd watch that.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Loki's-

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I would.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Alright, Loki's Cosplay Challenge.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Alright, lastly but not leastly.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Certainly not leastly.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Alan, your number one answer for a show that would get you to watch G4 again.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I'm gonna preface this response by saying that I used to watch

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.000
tech TV back here in the beginning when Adam Sessler, the host, extended play

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
out in front of the Metreon.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
He's very cute. I'm sorry.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.000
My number one answer is Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira present

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Black Boxer Reef Boner Boxing, a Gaynard telethon to please, please come out of the closet.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I just shortened it to Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It works, right?

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Alright, even though there was something about boxer briefs.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
I don't know.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing works for me.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Alright, so here it is.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000
The list as it stands right now.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
The 12 on the list.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
New Japanese Iron Chef, Real Housewives of Disney,

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Starrcade 2 Electric Boogaloo, Olivia Munn Apology Special,

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.000
The Screensavers, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling,

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Days of our Citadel, The Mass Effect Soap,

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
35-Year-Old Nerd Special, Big-Breasted Bikini Car Wash,

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Angry Video Game Nerd TV Show, Loki's Cosplay Challenge,

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
and Adam and Kevin Black Boner Boxing.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.000
So, unfortunately it is time to go around and take items off the list.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000
It's part of the process.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
It's painful, but science is painful.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Loki, which of these-

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Do it for science.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
There's a lot of them, actually.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Sorry, Alan.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Let's do the, uh, let's get rid of the Olivia Munn Apology Special.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
It's a one-time special, it's not a-

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:50.000
She is on the Daily Show, she is fucking awful.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000
They are responsible for her and they need to pay reparations.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:56.000
They need to pay.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Alright, that's part of the game.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
At least he didn't eliminate Black Boner Boxing.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I almost did Loki's Cosplay Challenge.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Alright.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
You know, it's for the listeners.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Alright, and Black Wolf would like to point out they did cut her from the Daily Show.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And that's why Jon Stewart is the best person on television.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Alright, the Olivia Munn Apology Special is gone, which makes sense.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
There's nothing left to apologize for.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Big Breasted Bikini Car Wash.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Because, because, it's so cliche.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I mean, why don't you have Big Breasted Monster Truck driving or something?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Hey, we can have a network based on this.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Big Breasted Entertainment, the BBB.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Alright, my turn to eliminate something.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
I am going to eliminate...

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
Oh, this is hard.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
I really hate to do this.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
The Dark Sakura, the gorgeous ladies of wrestling's gotta go.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I'm sorry.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
You never watched it.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I'm not a wrestling person.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
It wasn't just that, it was...

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
You have UPN for your wrestling needs or whatever.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
CW or whatever it is now.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:13.000
But there's no more glow.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Alright, I'm sorry.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Nothing is like glow.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I'm sorry.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Will you forgive me?

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Will you forgive me if Pinkberry is involved?

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Yes.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Alright.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Uh, Allen, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Last time I did a list list, I would say that I would be the chat room's voice.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:34.000
Because I'm infamous for getting rid of the thing that they most want to win.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Like President Cat.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.000
So I'm trying to look at what they don't want to get rid of.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
I'm gonna say...

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
New Japanese Iron Chef.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Because I don't see that mentioned at all.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Alright.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
New Japanese Iron Chef.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
It is stricken from the list.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Alright, so there it is.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
You are left with...

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
How did 35 year old nerd specials survive?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I don't even understand that one still.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Can you explain that one more time?

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.000
We live it.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Don't resent it.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Rob, don't dream it.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Yeah.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Alright, let's see.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Some of the comments from the chat room.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Some of the answers from our chat room that did not make the cut.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Shane kind of was onto something because Shane suggested hot guys playing games in underwear.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:30.000
And you sort of did do that one, right?

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
There you go.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Let's see.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Tigerclaw says when G4 gets syndicated episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Stan says the late show with GLaDOS.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Taiki says Clippy B's Drag Race.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Virtual Phil says RuPaul's PVP Bloodbath.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000
A lot of folks, Duke Nukem saying Arena, Portal, Icons.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000
And the shows that actually were on G4 some time ago.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Alright.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
So here it is one more time in chatters.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
It is time for you to vote.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Send Rob Roberts a private message with your number one and number two pick.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Here it is.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
There it is.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Should it be Black Box or Boner Boxing?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I think Black Boner Boxing.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
But Black Boner Boxing sounds better.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
It goes back to our reoccurring theme of Big Black Cock.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000
But remember it's really guys in black boxer briefs wrestling with boners.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
What was it?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Adam Sessler and Kevin Pereira's Black Boxer Brief Boner Bonanza.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Alliteration special.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Alright.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Send in your votes.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Please vote now.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Send a private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two pick.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Alright.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.000
And while we do that it is time to go to the mailbag.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Are you going to read these tonight, Dark Soccer?

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Or do I need to?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Please do.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
My voice is actually going.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeloungeradio.com.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
And we pick some of our favorites to read here on air.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Except I haven't pulled up the mailbag yet.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I do have it up so I'll just go ahead and do it.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Wait.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I'm there.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
I'm there.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Do you want to do?

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Okay.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Never mind.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000
I'm in it.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Let's see.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Where are we going to start tonight?

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Were you going to read all four?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Yeah.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Okay.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
I didn't know if you'd screen them or not.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Professional radio, boys and girls.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Let's start with ACHP.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Hey OLR crew.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I decided to check out a new anime called Aoi?

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I don't know how to say that word.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Aoi?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Aoi.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
It means blue.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Aoi Sekai no Chusen de.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:00.000
It's touted as being a parody of the old console wars between Nintendo and Sega with gratuitous

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.000
fan service.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
And as far as I'm concerned, it delivers.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000
It tells the story of the small country of Sega fighting against Ninteldo for control

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
of their continent.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.000
It's only on its first episode as of this writing, but so far they've introduced a number

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
of somewhat easily recognizable, at least by Dark Sakura.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Not sure how massively knowledgeable on classic Sega games Rob and Loki are.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Parody characters.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
A blue haired protagonist named Gear who is super speedy and is trying to avenge the death

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
of his beloved friend Teal.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Okay.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I know Sonic and Tails.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Come on.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Give me some.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Cut me some slack here.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Cut me some slack here.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000
A purple haired sister Nell who is his emotional support like Nii from Phantasy Star 2.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
The general Hermes.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
He has colored gems on her necklace.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Maybe a parody of columns.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
The rival lieutenant with little angel wings in her hair Opal based on Opa Opa.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Opa Opa Opa Opa.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000
I love the Opa Opa.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
And a genius tactician Tetraloth who loves sticking a long stick into things to fill

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:00.000
holes.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:03.000
I'll give you three guesses on what that's from.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Pornography.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000
A picture for the host's benefit.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
A little picture there of all the characters.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Okay.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
I need to see this.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
That is pretty cute actually.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
I'm getting this.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
I like the little monkey.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:22.000
It's super dumb and has girls clothes coming off for pretty much no reason.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
That's all you need right?

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
That's classic TV right there.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
And the main villain has a giant mustache.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
A sword with a mushroom shaped grip.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
And he rides a flying dragon.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Seriously.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Look at how dumb he looks.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Uh oh.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Oh it says no hot linking.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
What did you do?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Hold on.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I got to copy paste this link because it doesn't like me linking it.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.000
This is great radio when I copy paste.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I'm not going to let you because it's insane.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
So this is Ali Sekai no what?

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Hit that since it's from the website.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Blue world of what?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Sorry.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Uh.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000
I don't know.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Ali Sekai no Chushinde.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Huh.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Well I know the first part is blue world of something.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.000
In conclusion I highly recommend this anime because it's super dumb and pandering to people

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
who like classic games and big boobs.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
So I figure it would be perfect for OLR.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Correct.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:15.000
It is.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:16.000
That would be correct.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Hope you guys check it out.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Again it's Ali Sekai no Chushinde and you can watch it on Crunchyroll for free.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
In the center of the blue world.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Cheers AZHP OLR's premier gold star recipient.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.000
P.S. there shouldn't be any typos or grammatical errors in this email just for Dark Sakura.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Well joke's on you.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I read the email tonight.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:39.000
It looks like it was made by someone named Anastasia Shostakova.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Hmm.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
So.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Yeah I'm going to definitely.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I've seen manga for this I think.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Yeah.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Because yeah the design looks way familiar so yeah.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Alright well it's too bad we didn't hear about that before we were talking about the G4 shows

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
we'd like to see.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Alright.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Going to our next email which is from Nutman.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I just want to give my condolences to Jamie after losing her cat.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:08.000
My dog I had for 13 years just passed away recently and it was awful.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:14.000
We think she had a stroke at some point and she may have had many seizures before we could get her to the vet to be put to sleep.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.000
It was terrible and I wish that they would not have been the last memories I have of her.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
It sounds like Shermy.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000
I butchered the name I'm sure and they did spell it wrong but that's OK they tried.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Went peacefully during the night though.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I could never talk about it on air like you so massive kudos to having the courage to do that.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I think I would tear up.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Jamie did a very good job last week.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Thank you.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I did have a pretty significant sniffle.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Losing a pet and that was not the sinus infection either.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Losing a pet is something that only other pet owners can understand.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.000
I hope you will feel better about this terrible situation soon.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Happy face.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Well it's been about a week and a half now.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:57.000
And it's funny like last night I was walking back to the bedroom to go to bed.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:03.000
And I saw a shadow at my feet and my brain instantly went to it's Shermy and stepped over the shadow.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
And I was like wait that's not the cat man.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:13.000
So yeah it's getting slowly better but I still have problems doing laundry actually because that was Shermy's room.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Well a good excuse to make Dan do the laundry.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Seriously.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Alright Redertainment starts this email.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Trainer.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Hello Podcrafters.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Does he have a thing for like Trainer in the Mass Effect games or is this another reference?

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I need to know this.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Alright Redertainment wants to know hello Podcrafters.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
After seeing Loki's Halloween costume on Twitter.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Which by the way Loki amazing Halloween costume.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Have you worn it yet or is that for work?

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Uh it's for work.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
This question comes to mind.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:44.000
What is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Mine is the kigurumi I wore last year.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I might wear it again this year due to it's supreme awesomeness.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Stay care.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Redertainment.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Trainer.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Sent from my iPad.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
For the record.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.000
That's um basically the animal pajamas.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Is what those are.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Uh what is the weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween?

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
My weirdest costumes have always been for my actual cosplay.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Um.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Uh.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I don't really think I've done anything weird for Halloween.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I did go as a pirate wench.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Which was fun.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Cause I walked around with a whip and just started smacking on my coworkers.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Well and Halloween's about being slutty.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
No it wasn't slutty at all.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
It was just you know the bodice.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
That was about as slutty as it got.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:37.000
But it was a long skirt and big boots and a whip and my hat.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Uh.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
I tried one time to wear.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
I was gonna wear my bike in costume one year.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:49.000
But that would have just been cold.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Alright uh let's see.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Going to the next email.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Oh I'm sorry I want to answer the question too.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
The weirdest costume you ever wore for Halloween.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
When I was in 8th grade I dressed as a bag lady.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000
And I got sent to the principal's office because I hit a kid with my purse.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
But he had it coming.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
He was an asshole.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
He was one of those 8th grade bullies.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
And he dared to make a comment about my costume.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
And so I thwacked him with my purse.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Like a bag lady would do. Right?

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.000
He deserved it.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:19.000
What are you? Oh you're sending one from.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Oh an email?

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Oh okay.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Except I'm like full up on messages right now.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
So look at that.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Cause I gotta count the votes still.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Oh okay.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Sorry talking behind the scenes. No one could hear any of that anyway.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Jeez.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Alright one more email from Flaco Jones.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
He always emails Horde House.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
So I'm very happy to hear him crossing over here.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Flaco Jones. Hey OLR.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
I haven't heard anyone else on the show bring it up.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
And it's getting close to Halloween.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
So I thought I'd write in and get my review for

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Silent Hill the Haunted House or Maze

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
as they call it at Universal Studios.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
I am glad to hear about this.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Someone mentioned that to me by the way.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Having seen it. Maybe Extover?

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Cause he saw it. I don't think it was Extover.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
I think it was somebody else. But yeah.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Well anyhow. Since we didn't pony up the money for the front of the line

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
VIP passes. Huge mistake by the way.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
We were only able to try a couple of the mazes.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
But the Welcome to Silent Hill maze

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
was by far the best.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
While it was there to mostly promote

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
the new movie coming out. I really hope it makes

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
a return next year because we will book a trip

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
to experience it again in a heartbeat.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Despite the movie promotion angle

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
it also contained elements of almost all of the

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Silent Hill games. Save Shattered Memories

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
thank goodness. Like Lisa

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
from Silent Hill 1. All the way to

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
the Boogeyman Executioner from Silent Hill Downpour.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
It also featured appearances

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
from the nurses and Robbie Bunny as well

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
as Pyramid Head popping up multiple times

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
to chase us to the next room. In fact

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
once we were out and thought we were safe

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
he made one final appearance and chased

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
my wife all the way out to the actual exit

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
of the attraction. She was extremely

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
frightened being a huge fan of the games

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
and finally getting to see some of these monsters

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
in person. They also did a great

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
job nailing the ambiance of Silent Hill

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
with the siren off in the distance

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
as we made our way through the line to the

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
flashlights and radio static inside the maze

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
itself. It was a great time and they did

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
a fantastic job. It better be there

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
next year because we can't wait to go back.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Happy Halloween Flaco Jones.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Well bad news for Flaco Jones

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
the movie came in 6th place

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
at the box office this week.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Not looking good for any

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
long term memory but then again if they

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
invested all that money in it

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
who knows maybe they will bring it back again

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
next year. That does it for emails

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
for tonight. Mailbag at

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us your

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
emails for a future

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
week.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Meanwhile it's time to get to the FUs

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
of the week.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:55.000
FU to my sinus infection.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I really hate it.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
I hate my voice going.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
And then my really

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
uneven haircut.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I mean I like having short

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
hair but it wasn't stacked

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
quite right so it's a little uneven in the back.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Yeah I think that's it.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Oh and origin.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
EA.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Loki.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
FU to my weekly headache.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Oh you have a headache again?

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Yep I get them every Sunday.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
I don't know where it's from.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Sorry to hear it. Maybe I stay up too late.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Maybe you're allergic to this show.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
No it's before I get to the show so

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
it's not even an answer to the show

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
it's just get a headache.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Um an FU to not having enough hours

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
in the day because like I'm really like

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
we have not had time to go to the grocery store today.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
We've been doing so much but

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
that's alright.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I shouldn't complain about anything.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Yeah you were running around when I got here.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I took a 15 minute nap.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
And then I was like where are Loki's stories?

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
But it all worked out.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
In fact Loki has

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
another story for us before we get to the skype line

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
at 1877 game OLR

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
or our username on skype orangeloungeradio

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
just yet we'll let you know when here in

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
a moment. But meanwhile uh

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Loki. Yes apparently the

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Urban Outfitters is selling unlicensed

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
stuff to the product. Oh my goodness!

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
What?

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
How dare they not

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
license stuff to sell?

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And all this like really random stuff

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
I mean considering the Urban Outfitters is basically

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
like apparel.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
I mean it's kind of not really

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
something that I would see them selling.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
But like they're trying to sell Nintendo 64

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
controllers USB Nintendo

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
or Super Nintendo controllers and

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
like

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
the Supaboy

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
portable game console and one of those knock

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
off Super Nintendo things.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
I don't know.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Not really sure why this is news but

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
we're talking about it.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Well cause it's knock off shit

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
and it's um at a

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
major store you know. I don't know.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
So everybody sells those stupid knock off game

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
you know

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Super Nintendo Genesis things. I mean all

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
like the indie game stores sell them.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
And Urban Outfitters

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
that's just weird. That just seems

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
like Sears

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
selling something like that. I mean

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
it's just like who gives a shit

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
that they're selling that.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Well I'm

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
gonna go run to Urban Outfitters right now after

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
the show and check that out.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Just kidding. I'm just kidding.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Alright I got a story

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
for you guys here. It's about a

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
favorite game of mine getting an MMO.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
But there's a twist to it.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Isn't there always? It's a Civilization

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
MMO. Yep. Civilization Online

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
MMO. It's gonna be available

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
soon in Asia.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Yep. Fire Access

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
is working with XL Games

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
a Korean studio that did the game

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Lineage. You might have heard of that game. It's like the biggest

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
MMO in the world. Yes. Bigger than Warcraft.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
They're gonna create Civilization

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Online. It is an online only

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
game. It's gonna be in Asian markets

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
soon. Yeah.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
They're doing Civilization Online. They don't say a whole

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
lot else about it. Just otherwise the partnership

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
there. Not a lot of news about

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
what is gonna be in the game or anything

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
like that. But it's a

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
little weird to me because Civ V

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
you can already play online.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
So how does an MMO work?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Does it like never stop? Is it

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
like an endless world that you

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
can always explore? There's

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
more things about this I'd like to know. And the other one

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
is why won't we get a version

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
in the US? Maybe

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
E3 they'll announce some type of partnership

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
to publish it here locally. I hope so.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Cause I'd like to be able to try this you know.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Alright

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
that's gonna do it for the news tonight

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
which means it is time to open up

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
the Skype line. 1877 Game

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
OLR. Our username on Skype

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
is OrangeLoungeRadio. Give us a call.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
We'll talk about whatever you

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
want to talk about in the news tonight. Or

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
maybe something else. In the

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
meantime we'll get to Twitter topics at Twitter.com

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
slash OLR or

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Loki. I don't know if there's anything

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
you want to add here for last minute stories while we

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
wait for some calls. Apparently GameStop's opening

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
GameStop kids stores.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Oh I saw that. Alan posted that link to the

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
OrangeLoungeRadio Facebook page. Tell us a little

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
more about this. 80 locations are gonna

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
specialize in E-rated games

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
and it's Evil G Junior.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I don't know.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
It's like a mall

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
type store.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Alright we have a call coming in. Let's go to the phones.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Hey how you doing? It's Bobby.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Hey Bobby. Good to hear from you. What's up buddy?

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Nothing much. You guys were talking a lot

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
about G4 earlier. Yes we were.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
In fact we dedicated a whole segment

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
of our show to it tonight.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And I didn't dedicate anything.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
I know. What's up with that?

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I'm a little conflicted just because

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
of my past and stuff with G4

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
and I'm trying to figure out

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
how I want to say what I want to say.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Okay well for those that don't know

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
tell us a little bit about what the past

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
is for you. Okay so

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
for those that

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
don't, well I mean obviously we came

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
from All Games

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
and Scott Rubin but I had met Scott Rubin

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
a long time before then.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I met him in 97.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
And he was one of the people that started

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
G4 after his

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
first incarnation of All Games went away in the

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
dot com bust. So I

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
was pretty much right there

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
at the formation and creation

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
of G4 as an outsider, as a

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
volunteer.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Back before

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
back when we just knew it was

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
something that a Disney guy

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
was going to be starting with Comcast.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
And that's all we knew about it.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
So I was there

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
when they launched the site in April

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
of 2002 and the network

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
didn't go on the air until for a couple months later

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
I think. And so

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I was there and I actually was

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
the first forum moderator over the G4 forums.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
I ran the chat room for

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
about two years. I was on

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
the majority of the shows that were on

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
G4 at some point.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
I actually have a VHS tape that's like 30 minutes

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
long of every single time I was either mentioned or shown.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
I never realized that you were actually

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
on the network at some point. I never realized that.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I was. As I was the

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
for some of the shows I was

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
like the backup caller.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Cause they had a talk show G4tv.com

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
which was hosted by Scott Rubin and

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Laura Foy and Tina Wood.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
And they taped

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
they would do a live stream of their taping but since

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
it was a TV show it was like a five hour taping.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
And so we were all kind of in the audience.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
And they would take calls.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
And sometimes I would be the one who would call in

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
and I'd work out with the producer what

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
I talk about. Or I would be

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
the backup if the guy that they

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
wanted to call in flaked out.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
And so I would have to make up stuff

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
about games I've never played.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And act as a caller. Like there was one about Splinter Cell

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
and you know me I would never play Splinter Cell.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Right. But I actually called into the show

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
once as if you know it was still me.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
I mean I wasn't playing a character or anything.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Talking about Splinter Cell.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
It's really funny. I do want to

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
make a minor correction to something you said. Cause you

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
said we came from all games. Which you know

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
that was our previous home

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
prior to this. But you know

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
we had started elsewhere before.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
So we were around on our own Live 365

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
thing when G4 started. So

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
we were those viewers out there that was kind of

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
a little critical and cynical of what was going on

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
on G4 television. But admittedly

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
I was also

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
critical and cynical cause I left.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
You know and it was

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
basically I mean everybody. And it's kind of funny

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
because my version of G4 is different from

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
other people's version of G4. Because

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I stopped my

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
involvement with G4 about the same time Scott

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
did which was after the tech. Right after the tech TV

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
merger. Because I didn't like the way they handled

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
it. And to a lot of people when they say

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
oh G4 they think the screen savers.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
They think call for help. They think X-Play.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
That wasn't G4.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
That was tech TV.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
You know the G4 that I remember was

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
mostly you know like

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
G4tv.com and Icons and

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Cinematech and Pulse and Portal and

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
and all these games. Arena

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
and all those

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
and they were

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
they had some great ideas. The execution was lacking

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
just because of budget. But they didn't give

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
them a chance to actually get the budget.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
For any of those shows.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Huh.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I remember Pringles Presents

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Yeah. That was cheat.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Pringles presented cheat. But what was interesting

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
is because I actually did get to meet

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
most of the hosts from the 2002 to

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
2004 including the illustrious

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Will Wheaton. And they all kind of

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
knew who I was. Just through

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
the forum posts and stuff because they interacted

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
some and I would be the liaison sometimes.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
And a lot of them

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
a lot of the hosts actually did know what they were

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
talking about with video games. Which was the main complaint

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
everybody had about the original G4 host.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Is that they didn't know what they were talking about. They were just

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
reading a teleprompter. Two or three

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
of them were reading teleprompter and didn't

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
know. But I could actually have

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
intelligent conversations with the majority of the hosts

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
of all the G4 shows about

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
video games. And that's one thing a lot

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
of people didn't realize back

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
before the merger.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Why do you think people didn't get that?

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Why do you think that got lost in translation?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Was that over production? Was that

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
you know and I see

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
TigerClaus in our chat says the G4

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
TV.com show was heavily scripted.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
The callers couldn't call in and call about whatever

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
they wanted. Is that because maybe they took some of the

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
organicness about it out of it?

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Yes because they it was

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
basically it was a video game channel being made

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
by cable television executives.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
So they followed the

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
cable television model. They didn't know that much about

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
video games. They just they thought

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
they knew the way to do it and

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
that's one of the reasons Scott Rubin left was

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
because he couldn't get into their head

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
that they were doing it all wrong.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
And they didn't listen to him because all he had done is web

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
stuff. He didn't know how cable industry

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
worked. Well right in some ways

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
the original G4

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
was kind of like an extension of the

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
first era of all games right?

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Yeah and I mean that's why they brought a

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
bunch of people from the original all games.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
There were four people from the original

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
all games network that they brought over

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
flew to move from New York to California

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
with Scott Rubin.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Laura Foy was from the original all games.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
With a lot of the other the non-gaming shows

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
at pseudo like High Weirdness and stuff with

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Judge Cal. But Josh Crane

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
and Jim Downs also worked with

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
the with pseudo in the all games network

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
and they became Josh Crane became

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
an executive at G4. He's no

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
longer with them and Jim Downs was a producer

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
who was also no longer with the network.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
So you know none of them

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
are with the network anymore. But there

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
were some people that are still there

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
and I don't know if they're still going to be with the network after

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
the change or what because they kind of did

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
more generic stuff with the TV network.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
I was going to say is there anybody still at G4

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
that was there at the very beginning?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Yes there was one guy his name

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Derek I'm not going to give his last name but people who

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
probably from the all games era know who I'm talking about

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
he is still there. And

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
he's the only one I really know of that is still there.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Wow.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
And he was also kind of from that

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
pseudo online. He might have been

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I don't know if he was flown from New York but I know he was one of

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Scott's friends. So let me ask this

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I mean you know obviously this news

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
has you a little conflicted because it is kind of rough

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
to see the last remnants of

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
G4 disappearing but these

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
shows were tech TV

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
shows that are the last

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
didn't this all kind of already end five years ago?

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
I think it all well

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
G4 to me ended in 2004.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
You know and I liked tech TV

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
too. I watched both networks. I watched the screen

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
savers every day on tech TV.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
And the reason G4 bought you know

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
well the reason I'll kind of expand

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
because you read some of my comments. Basically

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Paul Allen who was one of the VP's of Microsoft

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
he bought a lot of things and he's the

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
guy that started tech TV because he wanted a

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
cable television network

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
about technology. He got bored with it.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
And said

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
you know I know you guys are about to pull a profit and pull

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
high ratings you know tech TV was on the rise.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
He's like but I'm bored. And

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Comcast is offering money so I want it. And Comcast

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
wanted tech TV because G4

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
could not get on direct TV.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
They couldn't. Direct TV rejected

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
them. Said that we don't want your content.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Tech TV was already on

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
direct TV so

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
that was their Trojan horse

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
and so they became G4 tech TV

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
and this is why they actually did that

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
because they could not change the type

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
of network until they renegotiated the contract

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
with direct TV. So

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
in order to be broadcast on tech

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
TV signal they had to retain

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
tech TV's

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
type of content. And that's

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
why they kept the screen savers and kept

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
some of the other tech TV type stuff

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
and became G4 tech TV

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
and then once they renegotiated the contract

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
they went back to G4.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Interesting.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
And it's

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
funny I told you I was going to tell this story

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
in chat about

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
one of my most famous

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
acts

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
one of the acts that has shaped cable

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
television that I did

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
or at least I claimed to do.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
And when I say this story I realized that

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
at the time I believed

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
this was true and

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
to his credit the

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
other person played along and told me it was

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
true but looking back I'm pretty

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
sure that my version of events is a little bit

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
different than the actual history

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
but basically back in like

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
2003 or whatever

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Scott was trying to fight the director

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
of G4tv.com

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
trying to get him to do some more

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
hardcore gaming segments that the director who didn't

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
know anything about video games he knew about cable TV

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
didn't want to do. And so he really

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
wanted to hire a production assistant

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
to kind of give

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
him help him get leverage over the director

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
so now it's two voices instead of just one

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
because G4tv.com really

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
devolved into what

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
can we make Laura Foy and Tina Wood do

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
to appease the teenager

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
male demographic.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
And that's why they did the

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
challenges that had the

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
gross

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
ending to it or whatever

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
you know the humiliation at the end.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
And

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
in comes chat one day is

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
somebody that I kind of remember from the old

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
pseudo days from Shooters which is one of the old

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
all games network shows. Captain Emmie

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
and he was sitting there

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
talking about how he didn't like

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
where he was. He was working at some public access

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
station or some real low TV station

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
and I knew Scott was working for

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
a production assistant

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
but Scott actually told me

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
he didn't want me to come out for it because I wouldn't

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
get paid enough. But I

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
told Captain Emmie that

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
hey Scott's looking for this guy

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
for a production assistant. He's like

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
oh no I couldn't ask him for that. I'm like no really

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
he's looking for

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
somebody to fill the job.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
And Scott comes into chat and I'm like

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
hey Scott Captain Emmie's looking for a job

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
and it was oh really.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
And

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
to kind of

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
tie the story together Captain Emmie was the

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
screen name for Kevin Pereira.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
So I

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
believed for the longest time and to Kevin's credit

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
he agreed with me that I got him

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
his job at G4.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Now the real version is more

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
like Kevin knew the job was open

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
he was coming into chat just to see when Scott was

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
around to talk to him about it. But he

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
you know he'll

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
play along and say that I kind of

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
pointed him in the direction when I think that was the direction

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
he was going in anyway. I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
So

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
yeah in some

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
ways you can blame me for Kevin even being hired

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
at G4 in the first place.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Or maybe thank you in the case of Alan

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
and what he said during the list list segment tonight.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
So there you go.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
But

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I mean the shows I liked on G4

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
the most were actually not produced by G4.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Electric Playground and

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Judgment Day were from Greedy Productions. They're still

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
in business. Electric Playground is actually the

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
longest running television show about

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
video games in the world. It's been

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
running since 1995.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
And they actually recently went daily

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
but they're mainly Canadian.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
They're produced up in Vancouver and

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
Judgment Day is actually just a re-skinning of

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
their show Reviews on the Run. G4

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
wanted something specific and

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
so they took the Reviews on the Run footage

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
that had Victor Lucas and Tommy Tallarico

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
and put G4 graphics around it.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
And that's all they did. So in Canada it was Reviews

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
on the Run. Here it was Judgment Day.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
They still do Reviews on the Run and what's funny is

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Tommy Tallarico no longer

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
does any of that stuff because he's so busy with video games live.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
But one of the

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
people that does Reviews on Reviews on the Run

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
was kind of like me in

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
the same sense that we were in the G4

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
forums together and

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
kind of attached to specific shows

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
and personalities. I attach to Scott Rubin. I do

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
podcasts. This guy

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Jose Sanchez, he went by Fubar,

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
attached himself to Victor Lucas and

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
he now is one of the hosts on Reviews on the Run. He was

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
a production assistant there for Greedy

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
for the longest time and worked his way up.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Wow. That's awesome.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Huh.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Well, it's been story time with

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Bobby Blackwolf but this is good.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
It's kind of neat to hear the history and I hope you do

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
end up doing your piece for VOG Network

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
about kind of reflecting on it.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Gosh, I'm

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
trying to think what else to ask you with this thing but

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
do you think there is a future

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
for video game

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
television? Do you think

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
somebody else we don't know of

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
yet could come in and start a video game

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
network or is it just, you know what, no

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
video game stuff is always going to be on the internet.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
This is something always internet based.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
There's only one way

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
I think and

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
it's going to, basically I'm looking to

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Korea. The only way that we can

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
get a video game channel is if

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
esports takes off in America the way it's taken off

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
in Korea. That's the

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
only way I think it'll happen. I don't think we're going to see

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
a generic video game network like

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
G4 and I mean G4

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
tried a whole bunch of different things. They didn't have

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
all new shows. They had one show that was a scripted

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
show and it was about

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
and took place in MMOs. It was an early

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
machinima show using a

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
whole bunch of different MMOs to tell this overarching

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
story. It was Portal and

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
they tried stuff like that

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
and it didn't really

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
take off and

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I don't think anybody has the patience to make

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
that take off but I think

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
with esports, I think

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
if esports does take off, if League of

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Legends takes off or Starcraft or something

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
we don't know about yet, we may

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
be able to get a dedicated esports

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
channel but that's probably

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
as close as we're going to be able to get.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
I would see it probably ending up more

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
being an esports show

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
on the Ocho or something

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
along those lines but

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
I don't know.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
I'd like to be able to see

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
something and hopefully it will be

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
less corporate

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
controlled. I mean I know that's just

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
looking at it through such

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
dream pie in the sky ideals

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
but yeah

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
it sounds like a lot of the crap that happened

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
on both G4 and TechTV were just

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
bad executive decisions.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
But

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
and I'm going to point this out, Leo Laporte

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
tweeted this week, Attack of the show

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
in X-Play on G4 lasted 8 years

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
that was longer than any show on TechTV.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
That's true.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Because TechTV

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
started in I think 1999

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
and they were off the air in 2004.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
Good point.

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Alright well Bobby, before

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
we let you go to take more calls, do you have anything else you want to share

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
with our listeners tonight?

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I've been doing a lot of interviews lately.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
And they've been pretty good.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
And I've got a big

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
interview show next week. I'm not live.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
But I've got some

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
big interviews. Hotline Miami which is a new

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
indie game that everybody is loving right now.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
And then

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
MechWarrior Online and Fallen

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Enchantress. All those interviews next week.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
I interviewed a local studio

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
about their first person

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
magic game this week, earlier tonight.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
They're Xavian and actually

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
a lot of their developers were in chat.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
And I've already gotten an email

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
from them thanking me for it and

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
telling me that it sounds like one of the quotes I said

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
may be on the back of the box in two years.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Which would be awesome.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Unfortunately I wasn't the one that

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
initially said the quote Dungeon Buster did so I don't know how this

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
works.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
But they specific because it's a first person

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
magic game and Dungeon Buster

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
in chat was like...

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
It's like Skyrim's magic system done right

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
and I repeated that and that's what they

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
quoted in the interview that they really appreciated hearing.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Interesting.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Alright we'll see what happens.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Well yeah if you're not already tuning in

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
an hour early at vognetwork.com

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
before OLR you're missing out on a great...

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Bobby's having a great year. I mean not

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
that the other seven sucked but you're having a

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
great year. But I still

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
got snubbed.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Don't go there.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Did you look at the

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
list of who got nominated? It's a lot of

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
corp stuff. It's unfortunately...

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
And I think the corporate stuff gets nominated

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
because people want to make a complete ballot

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
and they don't know who else to nominate.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Yeah.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
There you go.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Bobby you definitely earned

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
a place in our hearts.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Thank you.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
Alright well Bobby I'm going to let you go to get some more calls.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Have a good one buddy. You too.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
That was fun reminiscing with

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Bobby. We have another call coming

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
right in though so let's get to the phones.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Hi you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Greetings Ronald Roberts.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
This is DJ Ron Ness live from the

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Brooklyn Studios of anime jam session.

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Oh my gosh.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I thought I heard wind in the background there.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Is the storm rolling in?

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Are you getting blown by Sandy right now?

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
It's raining sideways!

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
What?

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
It's raining sideways!

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
It's go rain!

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
It's go rain!

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Yes yes yes.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Right now

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
I'm going to tell you the same thing

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
I told Travis and Jessica

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
last August when Irene

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
reared her little head up in here.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
What's that?

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
It's windy as hell.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
It's a little bit of rain.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
The shoreline

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
of Jersey has been more or less

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
flooded out but this Jersey no one

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
cares. The

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
anime jam session studios are in

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
zone B which means

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
we do not have to go anywhere.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
We're also on the second floor which means

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
we don't have to worry about being flooded out.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
And we have enough battery backups here

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
so if the power does go out

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
we will have internet for another eight hours.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
It's the important

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
things in life.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Alright I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about the

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
hurricane though. What did you really want to talk about?

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Well

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
there was something else that we

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
did as part of my

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
podcast on Friday.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
We went to an event in lower

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Manhattan called Girl Gamers

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Meet Up New York City.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
But you're not a girl.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
No but

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
some of my staffers are.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
He's meeting up with a lot of the girls.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
You just went to go get some phone

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
numbers. No I'm kidding I'm kidding.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
That sounds fun.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
We'll save that for another time.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Nice.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Why thank you.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
But pretty much

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
the point of the Meet Up

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
was to get more girls involved

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
into playing video games to prove that

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
it's not just boys

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
and men that are playing. Girls and women play

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
video games and they can kick as much ass

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
as their counterparts.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Absolutely. Right DarkSagra?

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Right. She said right

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
but you can't hear her anymore.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
I'm sorry everything's just exploding because the Giants

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
apparently won. Oh.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Is that their fourth game? Yeah.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Oh boy. That's it then.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I'm so glad I didn't go to

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
San Francisco this weekend. I am so

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
glad.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
To quote Renee

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
and sorry for taking over

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
Ronchon. No that's okay.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
The city in which I reside has erupted

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
in cowbell car alarm and hollering.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Either the Giants won or this is

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
a prequel to some Satan pagan worship before

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Halloween.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Well

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
given that I am

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
a boy and brand new yorker

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
trust me when we feel the

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
pain of not being there and

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
whereas there are the mixed fans that are like

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
well this was really going to happen.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Nice. Alright so

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
sorry to derail but what else did you

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
get done at the con? No problem.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Well what we did was we

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
got a chance to interview

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Jen Vargas the founder

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
and creator of Girl Gamer Vogue.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
The point of her creating this

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
is to prove that girls

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
are just as good as gamers as guys

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
and to break the stereotype

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
and prove that there is a difference between

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
girl gamers and gamer girls.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
You know the type of girls who sit there

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
and they kind of look sexy with a controller

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
and you know

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
they don't like that.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Well you still there?

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
I'm still here can you hear me good sir?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Yes I can. What was that last part you said?

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I said the last part was

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
about how to try to break the stereotypes

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
and prove there is a difference between

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
girl gamers and gamer girls.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Ah okay

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
okay so Olivia Munn is not necessarily

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
a representation of gamer girls everywhere

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I get what you mean. Exactly.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Absolutely. And they had some

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
and they had some gamer girls

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
there too in costume

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
talking about their YouTube channels and how they

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
give tutorials on how to play

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
various games how to get through certain

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
action games and they had a

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
theme they were playing we had

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Gears of War 3 with Zombie Mod

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Left 4 Dead 2

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Gauntlet and Friday the 13th.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Friday the 13th like the 8 bit

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
NES game?

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Yes. Yes it was. Amazing.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
So where can we hear these interviews?

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Well we

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
were holding on to them because

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
N.A. Jam session is so ever

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
grateful to Orange Town Radio

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
this interview that we did is exclusive

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
to O.L.R. Oh

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
awesome we're going to play that next week

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
so not only will we have Eddie from

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Money Style with us but we're going to play that interview

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
as well on the show so

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
thank you so much for doing that for us.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
No problem. When this popped up

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
the first person I thought of was my darling

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Rope Sean. Awwww

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Barf. Hey

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
shut up. I brought you vanilla

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Tootsie Rolls. You did. They're delicious.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Talk about barf.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Shut up. Since you are the man behind

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
the anime show and I know you have a whole

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
staff behind you but since

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
you are the guy on the show here representing

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
the anime jam session I've got to ask you

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
I don't know did you hear that email about

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
the anime that's Nintendo

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
and Sega and all that did you hear that

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
email? No

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
I did not.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
We may have to investigate that talk about that

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
on our show coming

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
up on this Thursday. You need to.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
I'll send you more information. It's available

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
on Crunchyroll apparently for free and it's

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
inspired by

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
old Sega characters apparently.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Do you remember the name of it?

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
There you go.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Wow. Very good. Good memory.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I'm actually looking at the page right now on Wikipedia.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Fantastic memory.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I linked it myself so I would find it.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
I just linked it on my Facebook.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Gotcha.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
I will definitely check that when I go back inside.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Awesome. Alright well

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Rama be safe. Don't float away.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
We will. We will.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
We're good. We have enough battery backup.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
We have enough alcohol. We are

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
good to go for the next 48 hours.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Sounds good. Fill the bathtub with water.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
We can't.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
We don't have a stopper for the water.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
We are so cold.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Oh no. Get every glass

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
in the cupboard and fill it up. Condoms.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Alright I'm

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
ending this conversation. Bye Rama.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
Be safe.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
You safe drivers good sir.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Alright.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Thank you so much Rama.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
And thank you to everybody that called in tonight.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Both our callers. Since both those calls

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
were a little long we're going to wrap it up.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
I'm sorry. But we still got to do

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
some more last minute stories on our Twitter topics.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
So we're like not even close to being done yet.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
We don't want to go for 4 hours tonight.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
So Loki do you have other last minute stories

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
before I get to the tweets?

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Yeah the John Sisters Twisted Dreams is now available.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
You can get that on Steam as part of

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
the green light thing.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I actually have a token for it.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
You can download it now.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Zynga is bringing

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Farmville or I should say

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
you know their online stuff

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
into online gambling.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Apparently they're planning on doing

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
a slot based

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
or slot simulator based on Farmville.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
And

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
may expand into other

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
online casino or

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
bidding type things.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Interesting. I think they only have like

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Farmville casino like actual slot

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
machines like real slot machines.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
I want to say they do have those so

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
not a surprise there.

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
And of course they lost

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
52.7 million dollars in

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Quarter 3. Probably why they had to

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
fire a lot of people or

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
lay off.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Yeah. I think people are just

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
kind of over those type of games now.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Although then again I get all these invites for

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Farmville too so maybe not.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Let me do some quick Twitter topics here.

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
I liked this tweet

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
here and I have to admit I'm not

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
informed on the topic very much

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
but I'll try here.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Nigella and I hope I said that right.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Nigella tweeted us.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Don't know if the Florence Gate saga has made it on

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
your radar. Raises interesting questions

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
about games journalism.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Now apparently what happened and he links us

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
to something that's on Reddit.

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
And here's the deal.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
According to what I see on Reddit here

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Robert Florence just

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
stepped down from Eurogamer because of

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
this column yesterday blasting games

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
journalists and their relationship

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
to PR. And he

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
links to a tweet from the author that says

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
yesterday was my last piece for

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Eurogamer. Here it is in amended form.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
I stand by every word of the

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
original piece. And I

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
remember reading this original piece.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Somebody linked it to me because it was

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
all around Twitter and I'm like why are all these

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
people joking about Doritos and Mountain Dew? Somebody fill

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
me in. And I remember reading

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
this original piece. Now

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
I'm not sure I understand

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
why this was

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
so

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
flipping terrible. Although I notice

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
there is an editor's note

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
following receipt of a complaint from

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Lauren Wainwright. Eurogamer

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
has removed part of this article.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
But without any admission of

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
without admission of any liability.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Eurogamer apologizes for any distress

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
caused to Miss Wainwright by the references to her.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
This article otherwise remains

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
as originally published. Now

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
because I don't have a photographic

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
memory. I don't know what that means

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
was cut from the article. My

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
assumption bolded

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
italicized underlined

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
was that it probably had to do with a

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
particular PR

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
rep or PR firm that

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
was kind of doing

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
some things that might be considered questionable.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
And you know the whole thing is about

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
basically

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
how tight of a hold

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
does PR have on games journalism?

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
How do you spell her last name?

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Right there.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Son of a bitch.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
I hit the button on my iPad that takes me

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
back to start. Hold on.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Son of a bitch. Alright there it is right there. There's the name for you.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Can I zoom in on that? No.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Because this iPad is so exciting.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
So there you go.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
I'm looking for the

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Black Wolf says he quoted the

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
public Twitter of Lauren Wainwright.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Her outlet threatened

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
libel which is nasty in UK

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
libel laws. They quoted

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
her public Twitter about how she was

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
OK with promoting hashtags

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
to win a Playstation 3

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
and then talked about how she was promoting

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Tomb Raider and then uncovered

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
that she actually works as a freelancer

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
for Square Enix. Do I need to

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
call back in? Maybe. You have

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
a better memory than I sir because I remember

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
looking at the original article and I was like

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
yeah I could have told you that for a long time

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
now basically.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
You know PR has its grip

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
firmly on hold of a lot of games journalism.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
That's why I've always said

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Indies are the best because

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
even though not everybody

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
you know is um

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
some of these indie gamers are probably the first ones

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
to do the or indie folks are probably

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
the first ones to do these hashtags to try

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
and win a Playstation 3.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
A lot of times that's where the most honesty

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
is going to come from as well.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Thank you Bobby for setting us straight.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
That kind of sucks that it cost this guy

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
his job though.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
There's a quote from Forbes by the way.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Go join Polygon.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
That's

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
they sound like a group. They're like a

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Voltron of game people.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
That's where you need to be buddy.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
Apparently

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
uh wow

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
alright

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
she has okay since then

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Lauren Wainwright has had personal verbal attacks

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
sent to her Twitter which she has now locked

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
her Steam account and other

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
networking sites. Well now that's crossing

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
the line ridiculousness.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
This is coming from other people.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
This was actually on

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Reddit. This is where I'm finding this.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
I'm just going to read a little bit of it if you don't mind.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Robert Florence wrote an article

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
calling out unprofessional behavior in gaming journalism.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
He then steps down from his job

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
at Eurogamer. That's so he quit.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
He wasn't fired.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Because of this article as he was told he would

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
be sued for libel against

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
Lauren Wainwright since in the uncensored

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
version he outed her for questionable behavior

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
since then she's had

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
personal attacks sent to her Twitter

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
her Steam account and other networking sites.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
The Forbes article states it only takes a few bad

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
apples to turn a conversation about free speech

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
and journalism into one about misogyny.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
So apparently people have been taking this

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
really seriously.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
He was calling out integrity

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
and people were turning it around as an attack.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
Black Wolf says

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Ben Kucera did a great article about

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
this whole thing on Penny Arcade Report.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
That doesn't surprise me at all. He's pretty good

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
about taking these situations and

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
putting them into perspective.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
I have to

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
admit again the core issue

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
we've all

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
known about that for a very long time

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
but this whole fallout and

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
especially now that part where people were like

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
threatening her on Twitter and shit

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
that's

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
that's stupid and that's unfortunate.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
What else can I say?

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Let's see if anybody's published the unedited.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Alright.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Well anyway

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
let me get to some more of these tweets here.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Surtur tweeted us and said

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
I love Bobby Black Wolf and

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
OLR so much and VOG Network.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Well we love you too.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Dark Sakura sends

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
kisses.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Snotty ones.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Let's see.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
SSJ100Matt tweeted us and said hey folks

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
I just want to let you know you guys are keeping

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
me company right now on my three hour drive

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
to Boston. Thank you.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
You're welcome. Three hour drive?

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
That's a long drive.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Alright. Let's see.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
Tigerclaw tweets us

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
the Mass Effect movie moves

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
forward with a new screenwriter.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
I know y'all love your Mass Effect

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
especially if your name is Shane or Dark Sakura.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
So let me read this

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
link here that we got tweeted to

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
from SlashFilm.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Apparently

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
screenwriter Morgan Davis-Foll

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
has been hired to make a

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
new pass at the script

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
for Mass Effect.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
This is the first big movement

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
on the project since 2010

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
when Legendary Pictures purchased the right

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
to the franchise.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
This writer though he has yet to have a

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
script to produce.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Interesting. But I guess

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
he wrote

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Alien Sleeper Cell and worked on

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Rescue Me as well as some Happy Madison

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
films. Oh god.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Oh god. That's not sounding good

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
so far. But he's a

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
massive Mass Effect fan

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
and producers liked his take after

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
obviously deciding not to move forward with

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
the original script by Mark

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Protosevich.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Interesting. Alright well as

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
long as it's more Rescue Me and less

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Happy Madison I'll be alright

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
because he actually is a fan of the games

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
but on behalf of the

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
entire fan community do not fuck

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
this up. Do not not fuck this up.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Tigerclaw

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
gives us one more tweet here about

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
EA

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
taking a part in American Cancer

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
Society's Making Strides Against

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Breast Cancer Walk.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
It's nice to hear about the good things

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
EA did. So let's

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
talk about this. He links us to a story from

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Game Politics. Team EA

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
took part in the American Cancer Society's

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Making Strides Against Breast

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Cancer Walk in San Francisco

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
to raise funds for the fight against

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
breast cancer. EA chief

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
operating officer Peter Moore

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
excuse me was on hand to kick off the

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
event and walked with the employees.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
So very cool.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Good on you EA

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
for doing your public service

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
for an important cause.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
So there you go. Thank you guys

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
very much for your tweets tonight.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
and yes Tigerclaw I know there's one more tweet

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
but it's a two tweet maximum.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
Loki any other last minute

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
stories you want to share tonight?

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Popcap and EA are

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
teaming up with the ADA to

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
give you free plants versus zombies

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
for Halloween. I got an email on that.

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
It's stopzombiemouth.com

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
and

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
it's kind of cool though I mean

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
if you're like trying to be cheap about

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
giving out candy and stuff like that you could be

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
like one of those people that gives out something else.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
Well they have coupons that you can print off

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
and basically

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
those are they have a code on

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
there that can be used between October 30th

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
and November 10th to redeem a free copy of the

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
PC version of plants versus zombies

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
for PC or Mac and

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
it's all the same code so

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
you can print off sheets of those cut them

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
up and give those out instead of candy if you want

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
to or with candy

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
or with candy

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
and so you can do that

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
if you don't feel like going to

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
basically just go back to the

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
stopzombiemouth.com website and

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
use the code

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
p-hater

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
p-a-h-a-r

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
p-hater

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
one of the

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
plants is a p-hat

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
I think it

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
it could be either way who knows

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
I think it's a p-hater because they don't like getting hit in the

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
face with peace

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
not you know

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
urine

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
so there's that and then of course

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
also this

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
I was kind of talking about before

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
I actually got to read the whole thing now

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
apparently there's going to be some updates

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
to the digital

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
millennium copyright act

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
remember before how it was okay

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
to jailbreak your

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
ipods and iphones and stuff like that

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
not going to be the case anymore

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
apparently

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
it's only legal to

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
jailbreak phones

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
or just say unlocked prior to

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
January 2013

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
basically after that it is

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
no longer legal to do that also

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
it's no longer legal to

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
jailbreak tablet devices

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
or root tablet devices

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
that's kind of

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
unfortunate you know kind of a big step

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
backwards to the whole thing

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
and there's more

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
more websites running that whole

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
disney toy box thing but we already know what that is

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
right I gotta say disney infinity

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
has a great logo

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
it does have a nice logo

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
it's very interesting that

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
you know one of the

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
they have two different components of the game

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
one of which would be

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
let's see here

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
pages not turning

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
correctly one of which

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
was dubbed the toy box

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
and one of course

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
is the actual characters

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
the playsets

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
the playsets of the toy box

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
and of course tying in with Monsters U

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Cars

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
The Lone Ranger

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
Incredibles, Toy Story

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
and Pirates of the Caribbean

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
and like we talked about last week

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
it's two Johnny Depp movies if I'm not mistaken

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
yes it is

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
he's in a lot of stuff and it looks interesting

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
they've got a picture here

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
the reader looks really

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
different not like

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
you know say

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
Skylanders but they've got

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
these characters and these coins

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
and then looks like

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
boss characters almost like

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
they have that mech thing

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
from the Incredibles so you can

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
team up with Buzz Lightyear

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
and Mr. Incredible

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
and stuff oh neat

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
I don't know very interesting

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
I hope the game's good I think

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
it probably will be I mean considering

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
how well Skylanders does

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
and Skylanders to be honest is a very new property

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
versus Disney

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
characters which everybody fucking knows

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
so

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
alright well before we wrap up

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
the show tonight I bet you thought I forgot

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
but I didn't

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
we have to reveal the winners of tonight's

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000

to tabulate the votes cause there was a lot of

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
participation tonight and I've been talking a lot

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
so let's

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
reveal tonight's winners of the list list

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
number three is a tie

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
the screensavers

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
and the

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
TV show

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000

two thing that would most get you to watch

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
G4 again

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Star K2

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
Electric Boogaloo
