27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 476 for October 7th of 2012.
45000	53000	If you happen to be listening to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
53000	60000	If you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or some other type of smartphone application, well that's cool too.
60000	71000	But please pencil us in sometime for a live show. We do tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
71000	80000	We are here to talk about video games and all that good stuff with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host tonight here, Loki.
80000	81000	Hi.
81000	82000	How you doing Techmaster Loki?
82000	83000	I'm doing fine.
83000	86000	Yes. What's new with you? How was your day?
86000	91000	It was good. I did a lot of non-gaming stuff like mowing the backyard.
91000	94000	Damn that real life stuff. Damn it all.
94000	100000	I've been putting it off for a while. Once the weather gets cooler then I'll do it and then finally the weather got cooler so I had to do it.
100000	106000	Alright, now before the chat room starts conspiracy theories, you'll notice I did not introduce Dark Sakura.
106000	112000	We do love Dark Sakura but she is not here tonight. She ditched our ass to go hang with gays at Disneyland.
112000	117000	Which, can you blame her? Let's be honest. It is the happiest place on earth after all.
117000	121000	So she is wrapping up her trip at Disneyland. She should be back for the next live show.
121000	125000	No sub co-host tonight. Alan's usually our standby co-host. He had to work.
125000	132000	I put a call out on Twitter but I was a little late in doing that because I've been a little bit busy too with some other stuff going on.
132000	139000	So it's just Loki and I here in the studio with you guys in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
139000	144000	The always present fourth guest on our show or I guess tonight third guest on our show.
144000	150000	BlackWolf in our chat says I can blame her just like I blame Rob. F you buddy.
150000	153000	What am I being blamed for?
153000	154000	I don't know.
154000	156000	I guess Bobby does not want to go to Disneyland.
156000	161000	Perhaps you introduce Jamie to the love of Disneyland.
161000	163000	No, no. It was the other way around.
163000	165000	So she was the dealer?
165000	170000	Yes. In this case Jamie was the dealer. Well it was really. You remember the OLR lesbians. Chris and Meg Z.
170000	175000	Who used to live here in the Bay area. They've moved to Wisconsin. That's why they haven't been on the show that much anymore lately.
175000	181000	But a few years ago they were the ones that took me to my first trip at Disneyland. They had already been taking Jamie.
181000	186000	So they really. It's lesbians fault that I'm in love with Disneyland.
186000	189000	Big giant pyramid scheme.
190000	195000	Perhaps. Maybe there's money being kicked back or whatever. But you know.
195000	200000	We spread the. We spread obsession love all around. See then I introduced Dark Soccer to Warcraft.
200000	205000	Shane introduced me to Mass Effect which I then got you know Dark Soccer into as well.
205000	207000	Thankfully I've been introduced to none of those things so.
207000	214000	Well who started Minecraft? Was that. Was that me or was that you? Who finally. I think that was kind of you on Xbox.
214000	219000	Well I think we were both on Xbox and then I decided to do the PC version and then.
219000	223000	And then unfortunately it was just downhill from there.
223000	228000	It's so fun. It's it's a good way to relax sometimes.
228000	232000	All right. Let's see. Going to more comments in our chat room.
232000	237000	Act Def talking about Dark Soccer's trip says it is the gayest place on earth literally.
237000	240000	Yes this weekend it is. But remember it's not officially recognized.
240000	244000	No officially recognized gayest place on earth would be San Francisco.
244000	248000	So you know unfortunately it's just today you know it's kind of like.
248000	253000	I would argue the gayest place on earth is a Scissor Sisters concert in West Hollywood.
253000	259000	But what do I know. Once again that's one of the temporary designations you know.
259000	264000	Whereas you know any other time it goes back to San Francisco.
264000	269000	There actually is. If I remember right in New York New York listeners help me out here.
269000	273000	But right off of Christopher Street which I recall is the gay district there.
273000	277000	There is a street called Gay Street. If I remember right.
277000	280000	New York listeners correct me if I'm wrong I know there's several of you listening.
280000	284000	And in our chat room at chat chat dot orange lounge radio.
284000	287000	Oh excuse me chat dot live dot vog network dot com.
287000	290000	You have one home for so many years it's hard to beat it out of your head.
290000	294000	What can I say. Let's see.
294000	297000	Brad from pod cultures in our chat saying Rob Roberts.
297000	304000	So Disney and games are social diseases now. Now let's not call it a disease.
304000	308000	Maybe just their distractions. That's what Rama confirming for me.
308000	312000	Yes there is a gay street over in the West Village. Thank you Rama.
312000	317000	You know if she was rich enough she would totally be buying that replica haunted mansion that they have.
317000	323000	I heard about that. What is that all about like a four street actual or excuse me four story actual replica.
323000	327000	Yeah it's a replica except when they show the inside like that doesn't look like the haunted mansion at all.
327000	333000	It doesn't resemble anything that I've seen. I don't remember there being a nice kitchen set and all this.
333000	336000	I hope it's not the Nightmare Before Christmas version. Don't get me wrong.
336000	341000	I love Haunted Mansion. I love Nightmare Before Christmas. I don't like it's like my IKEA versions.
341000	345000	Unfortunately a whole nother nightmare there. All right.
345000	352000	Before we get to our gaming weeks we always like to start off with a kickoff topic and I got to tell you I I'm kind of in the same boat as Loki.
352000	359000	We've both been very busy lately just with other stuff going on. I don't know specifically what Loki's had going on but I know here locally.
359000	369000	I am working very hard with some other people you might know actually Jessica Harper from under station lives Sunday night or Saturday nights here at Vogue Network is a big part of this too.
369000	375000	We're trying to bring the Rocky Horror Picture Show back to Sacramento which to take a trip down memory lane.
375000	387000	I've been involved with Rocky Horror for since like 98 and the first internet radio show I was on after my college radio shtick was under station live which was born of Rocky Horror.
387000	392000	So you can kind of thank Rocky Horror for getting me into internet radio in the first place in a roundabout way.
392000	400000	Well it's finally coming back to Sacramento and oh my gosh it has been a lot a lot of work and a lot of money and a lot of time but you know it's gonna be great.
400000	408000	I really can't wait for the show. So it does kind of cut into the gaming time a little bit. I don't know if you've had the same experience with the stuff you've had going on.
408000	416000	No I only did I only did the lawn mowing that was like two hours today and that was it. The rest of the week it hasn't been any any of that.
416000	427000	But that's all the show is Friday if you happen to be in Northern California I urge you to check it out in Sacramento at the Colonial Theater 10 o'clock on Friday October 12th is the big show.
427000	435000	And I'm hosting it and it will be a very crazy different side of me than what you see. Even worse than Hoard House so that's all I'm going to say about that.
435000	449000	But yeah if you're local please come see the show. But after that I will finally have some time to get caught up on a few things that I've been neglecting like VOG and you know video games playing games and things like that.
449000	464000	And it's just around the right season for Halloween and scary games and things of that sort going on which I thought we could talk a little bit about scary video games and games you know seasonal Halloween games.
464000	479000	Now Loki do you ever play scary games that actually scare you like I know I know you I know you maybe don't want to admit this but do you ever play like scary video games actually make you scared legit scared.
479000	485000	Well I did play bullet which back then but you know that's that's a little different is that the showgirls answer.
485000	501000	No that was just so terrible. No I don't really play scary games I guess. I don't know. Minecraft at one point was scary back when we were playing survival and you run into the first Enderman it's like oh shit there's Enderman then you realize how how pathetic they are then it's not very scary anymore.
501000	518000	But no I honestly don't really play any scary games because I don't have a lot of time for that stuff. Let alone time to like turn off lights play scary game. I'm not really into Silent Hill so which which is fine because all the Silent Hills nowadays kind of.
518000	534000	Yeah I remember those speaking of Silent Hill. I remember when you and I were living together a while ago. This has been like in the early days of O.L.R. that was right when Silent Hill for the room was new and I was playing through that one night and I legit got scared like ice.
534000	544000	I like screamed I let out like this totally girls scream because something really scary happened like I walked into a room and there was like one of those two headed baby monsters was coming right at me.
544000	552000	And I'm like and you're like you're sitting over there playing Final Fantasy 11 or something you just kind of look over like what the hell's wrong with you.
552000	560000	Like your response was classic. You were being highly insensitive and it was hilarious. Sounds like me.
560000	572000	Locopoco in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says scariest game ever. Spice World. See everybody's going for the what's your favorite scary movie showgirls. They're going for that answer.
572000	587000	Spice World is one of the most hilarious video games ever. I could tell another story about that but I won't about friends playing that game and just laughing and laughing and laughing a lot. Good times.
587000	599000	You know their bus has the same technology as the TARDIS. It's a lot bigger on the inside than it actually. It's a British thing. It's it's it's the secrets that the British folks have figured out.
599000	609000	Who cares about you know physics. That's fine. Make it entertaining. What up G in our chat says when does that new Silent Hill movie hit and should I see it.
609000	621000	I think it's the end of the last last weekend of the month right before probably near Halloween. There's the new Silent Hill game which is on the Vita that's been delayed forever and it's finally coming on the 16th.
621000	634000	That's probably your next Silent Hill bit but that's pretty much it. I mean it looks good. It's got what's his name from. Yeah I don't know what the hell his name is really from Game of Thrones.
635000	647000	There's a lot of or I should say a lack of scary movies this year isn't there because you have a paranormal activity. We don't have you. We do have a parent or is there any for. I haven't seen any of those movies.
647000	661000	Yeah there's a paranormal activity for there's insidious which apparently is really good. There's no saw anymore. No the saw is done. Yeah. Thank God. No they had those movies. They had I'm trying to think what else they had.
661000	675000	There was one. I think it already came out though there was one that was the Chernobyl Diaries. That was one that was supposed to be all right. But yeah paranormal activity for.
675000	690000	Trying to think when all their ones there are dark to see you with the save there. October 26 if I recall correctly Black Wolf with the gaming reference paranormal activity for apparently uses the connect to detect ghosts now.
690000	706000	Oh yeah I think I read something about that. It's just got to keep it current. Whatever it's just in a scene. Let's see Shayna link goes in our chat room saying the little goomba like enemies and braid freak me out for no reason.
706000	721000	I guess sometimes there's there's like certain like mobs that are just really creepy looking in video games that might kind of freak you out. I don't know. Maybe just hits that nerve. All right. Anyhow live dog vog network dot com if you want to comment along with the show.
721000	733000	I wish our soccer was here so I could ask her about scary games because I know she's played her share of them but oh well we'll get her answer next week as we ramp up to Halloween. Let's talk about video games we have been playing what little there may be.
733000	747000	I at least have one new game to talk about. I don't know what you got Loki. How was your gaming week. Well this week I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 as I normally do. I was going for what I call streak week which means I won every single game of the week.
747000	768000	I missed it by one. So I missed it by one and by three points and it was just because we were down the plane with only three people and it was a small map and it was just one of those games where I'd end up spawning on the opposite side of the map is the other two guys and you know they get kill and then it spawned the other side by the time I got over there and it was just back and forth like that.
768000	782000	So unfortunately it's just I wasn't able to rack up enough kills. I didn't know when the game prior to that you know by quite a bit I usually was doubling or tripling their scores but you know I got 16 out of you know that was a nine and 16.
782000	810000	It was like 18 out of the 19 games we played. That's not bad. So whatever. And then I played Minecraft a little bit. Most of this week was spent just kind of wandering around because I didn't really know what I wanted to build because I got I mean I was sort of not really done my castle but I don't want to go through and furnish everything because it's a pain in the ass in creative mode to put stuff in chess.
810000	823000	You have to kind of put it into your hot bar and move it into your survival inventory and then go up to the chest and move it into from the chest. You know you saw that inventory into the chest and then you have to fill it all back up again.
823000	831000	You can't just like open the chest open the you know creative inventory or whatever and just drop everything in there that you want which would be ideal.
831000	846000	Yeah. Stupid asked me actually destroyed my chest and everything in it. But thankfully to creative mode I could put it all back and then some. Yeah. So there's that. And then I kind of.
846000	858000	Well I had prior to Rob getting on the server I was hustling to get the giant snowman done because you know the snowman went with the snow golems that were in his house and the mushrooms which my friend put in there.
858000	872000	Yeah. Thanks for that by the way. Those are fun. And we want it. Well originally I was going to that was a scary moment video games by the way when I logged into that and then all of a sudden and it's like moo cows.
872000	882000	Cows can be kind of scary. Just so you know you know they're changing all the sound effects for those cows soon. Really. Yeah. The next update they're going to have witches and bats.
882000	893000	And it's a Halloween update. So witches bats and some other fun stuff and they're going to have witches huts and they're going to redo all the sound effects for things. So that's kind of anyway.
893000	905000	So Minecraft actually did start working on a little bit. What was it they hit sun's been making this kind of wild network of portals to another and stuff. So you can walk around the map.
905000	919000	So I've been I was dressing up one of those portals because it's near my castle so I was going to incorporate that into the castle a little bit. I just like maybe I should just expand my castle a little bit more since I was kind of having fun doing that.
919000	933000	But yeah I'm going to try to stay away from making giant spheres in the game because that's a pain in the ass. And I did you know that snowman was huge. By the way I was originally going to have it where you'd step on something and shoot snowballs at you but it got too tall.
933000	947000	So I put arrows in it now but it still shoots all it does is shoot the like billboard which is kind of ridiculous. But so you built something to actually shoot the ad for Orange Lounge Radio that somebody built in.
947000	955000	Well it wasn't there when I was originally okay but they built it in there. So whatever it was funny.
955000	960000	And then what else did I play.
960000	965000	I know there's something else. Is it something my phone.
966000	977000	I downloaded the little big planet demo so I haven't gotten a chance to check that out yet but I was going to because I charged my via again. So I've been using it but I do want to pick up.
977000	981000	I may pick up a little big planet on that.
981000	993000	What else. What else. So it's again dishonored soon. So I'll have that. I don't know if I'm going to play it though. It's one of those things I may just sell it. I got Resident Evil 6 that's going.
993000	1003000	Yeah. I have not heard good things about Resident Evil 6. There's some people that are talking about it in chat. There's a few people I I've just been kind of keep my eye on chat. Some people are saying it's really not that bad.
1003000	1013000	I heard something about a final boss that's kind of it looks very over the top. See this is something like I don't know who any of these characters are because I don't follow the series at all.
1013000	1017000	It's just something I haven't gotten into and I don't really want to get into now.
1017000	1029000	Dishonored looks all right. So I'm kind of interested in that. Modern Warfare you know or not Modern Warfare Black Ops 2 looks interesting so I'll hopefully check that out once that gets around here which a whole lot of drama with that.
1029000	1041000	Here comes some of the comments. Acidic vampire in chat says Resident Evil 6 is not that bad. Which says to me it's kind of bad but it's not that bad. If you're a longtime fan maybe you'll put up with it.
1042000	1044000	Let's see someone else.
1044000	1055000	Code Man's asking a question about your Minecraft habits in another game that you've talked about before. Code Man says Loki have you gotten the Minecraft sniper rifle in Borderlands 2? It shoots Minecraft arrows.
1056000	1070000	I haven't but see that's the problem. Minecraft has kept me away from well Minecraft and my wife watching this the entire series of medium has gotten me kind of away from Borderlands because unfortunately I don't really have anything.
1070000	1079000	You know actually I could go in the other room and play it on the other TV. Well anyways I haven't really bothered to try to play it yet but it's been a while since I've been playing Borderlands.
1080000	1092000	That's one of the ones I was trying to go back and play this week but I just didn't get a chance to. I've been playing Minecraft because I haven't had access to the TV. I'm waiting for it to get done with the season. She's on season 5 right now out of 7.
1093000	1096000	When did she start because that sounds like pretty fast progress to me.
1099000	1100000	A month or two ago.
1100000	1101000	That's not bad.
1101000	1120000	Yeah so she's been watching Netflix and God that show is terrible. It's not terrible it's just you can totally tell when they like switched up the writers because the first two seasons were all right and then the third season it got weird and then the fourth season it got really weird and then.
1120000	1122000	Sounds like you've been watching a lot of it too.
1122000	1135000	I have been just because it's on TV and I've actually watched some of it before but the fifth season it's kind of back to how it was before it's like maybe that was when the writers strike was or something like that it just really strange.
1135000	1137000	But anyways I'm no medium talker.
1138000	1142000	So you late critical myth in chat says medium is a terrible show. I sympathize Loki.
1143000	1146000	Thankfully I've already spoiled it for my wife so.
1147000	1150000	Well she was spoiled books for me anyways you know.
1152000	1162000	So yeah so that's it. I probably go back and play some more Minecraft. I've been having fun without my coworkers having fun. I did I want been trying to figure out plugins that I want to put in there.
1163000	1190000	Although the server they run it can run it's basically got its multi craft is the front end and it's got a bunch of different server types you can do you can do a default you do like a vanilla server and optimize Minecraft server then bucket bucket server in a bucket beta server and buckets basically a server that has plugins in it and so you can add different bucket plugins to the game to do different things.
1190000	1207000	So one of the things I did which doesn't require bucket is I enabled raise many maps which is actually pretty awesome because one of the things that like I did explore the map and I get lost and I wouldn't be able to figure out where the hell my you know how to get back other than doing a teleport which I've been doing.
1208000	1215000	But now I had waypoints and so I know OK my house is in that direction so I know where I'm going and stuff.
1216000	1230000	So they did that oh one thing I did do in Minecraft I went back to the village because there's a village with actual villagers around there and their village was terrible because it spawned and there's like doorways that they can't get to so I made them a really terrible looking pink.
1230000	1244000	Pink wool house that they can go into and I spawned a bunch of villagers in there and a bunch of these iron golems to defend them against the zombies because all they were doing is like getting eaten by zombies so I had to repopulate.
1245000	1257000	So that's it but yeah looking for plugins I want to do the planes I want to do the planes but that requires like Minecraft Forge and I'm not really sure how to install that on a server that's not really my sound of access to the files that.
1258000	1270000	You know I think I have to ask them to upgrade you know us when the new Minecraft version comes out or something like that I think you have to do I don't think they do it automatically so I have to figure that out and I want to do the planes would be awesome and.
1271000	1281000	Maybe the guns I do want to do like a mob arena where we can just set up there's I think a bucket plug and reset up an area and you can just have it where you fight mobs and then when you die.
1281000	1292000	You know depending on how many mobs you kill you get a reward and you don't really die in the game you don't lose anything but you just die in the arena so it'd be kind of cool might set that up.
1293000	1303000	That's it all right well I don't want to turn this into the Minecraft show but I played a little bit of Minecraft as well I logged into the server and promptly got scared like hell as to all that crap that they put in my house.
1304000	1318000	And then I went outside and I saw on this vog server they just built everything around my house and I use this analogy on Bobby show as well but it's like you're the one holdout in the neighborhood who won't sell their house I'm like that old guy and up where everything is built around the house.
1318000	1328000	And they're trying to buy your house so I was like you know what I'm just going to I'm going to bulldoze my house and go somewhere remote it's not like I won't ever be able to get back we could build an elaborate rail car unit or whatever.
1328000	1344000	So I went to an unexplored part on my map that was just due south I just headed south of all that stuff code ban and chat says I got lost looking for skies new house I went south so there's a brick house that's up on a hill that's half finished unless.
1344000	1358000	Bobby I think I haven't been I was threatening to finish it for me I didn't finish I technically didn't finish this field all I did was just flat it out okay what's a joke I couldn't I couldn't think of anything I want to do my house is flat enough this mountain I'm sure he won't mind.
1359000	1367000	But I started to build my little brick house and I like the idea of being like a little bit farther away from all the action outside the city it's my summer home so.
1368000	1380000	Out there so I was working on that a little bit but I didn't have a whole lot of time for Minecraft I did play a little more World of Warcraft because obviously the expansion is still pretty great I'll leave all my thoughts on that to a horde house.com.
1380000	1392000	I will talk about a new game however the new game I want to talk about this week is did the stream go down people in chatter saying it went no I show that we're still submitting data so I don't know what the hell's going on.
1393000	1406000	The joys of doing live radio and we have nothing like Alan's not even here tonight so he's not playing Mass Effect or anything Jamie's not her computers not even here she's not here so we've got very little data I'm just yeah yeah all right well anyway.
1407000	1413000	Hopefully you all get back in time to hear me talk about the one game new game I did play this week because this is kind of important.
1414000	1424000	The new game that I played this week is Tokyo jungle on the PlayStation three yeah remember this remember this let me set the stage a little bit do you remember about.
1425000	1430000	Oh God I was probably about four or five years ago at this point we were talking about a game called President Cat.
1430000	1443000	And it was a game from Japan that I think the actual name of it was like Suki bonds to chow right now we are some of that I think about since our rain I probably butcher that name a little bit apologies to Japanese listeners.
1443000	1456000	But that was the game and we were looking at pictures of the game we were like oh my gosh this looks amazing it's like you play as this cat doing these crazy things like driving a car and doing all this stuff really where are these games in America.
1456000	1468000	Where are these new ideas where are these things we haven't seen before that are for the lols and hilarious and we started I think we got our listeners to tweet the people that made the game.
1469000	1477000	And it caught some of the game bloggers attention like we ended up being on joysticks of the other sites because of it like you know orange on radio took it upon themselves to make President Cat happen.
1477000	1489000	And then there was that whole follow up article about how Suki bonds so chow ran a we supposedly only sold 100 copies the week it came out which I still claim is is bullshit and somebody going for a sensationalist headline to one of those was mine.
1490000	1501000	Well yeah I know I'm like Loki bought it. But anyway so if there is ever a time to get President Cat it is now present presidential race is on.
1501000	1504000	That's right. Vote number three President.
1505000	1513000	It was 2008 because we I remember there was a ad that was poking fun at the Obama hope campaign. So it was 2008 when all that went down.
1514000	1525000	But anyway the point is why I bring that up to Tokyo jungle is that here is a game that's kind of that same crazy Japanese idea but it's actually coming out here.
1525000	1535000	And the whole trick of it is that you know humans are gone. It's this you know world where the animals are basically you know fighting to survive because humans are gone.
1536000	1548000	And now the cities are still there it's like the zombie apocalypse happened or something the animals are still alive. You get to unfold part about like what happened as you play more and more of the game.
1548000	1556000	But you basically select what animal you want to play the game as and you start with two you start with one carnivore and one herbivore.
1557000	1567000	And you can play as a little Pomeranian dog is the part of where you start as or you can play as some type of deer like a silica deer I think it's called or something is the herbivore that you can start with.
1568000	1573000	Oh thank you off can anagram says it was October 22nd 2009 I guess it wasn't that long ago.
1574000	1580000	And Tiger class is the premise of Tokyo jungle is similar to that show on the Discovery Channel called life after people.
1581000	1592000	Well anyway you can play as one of these animals and the game kind of plays a little bit more like an arcade game it's fast much faster pace than you think you quickly are trying to get all these goals.
1592000	1603000	And it would be basically to kill other animals and eat them because you have to eat to survive because your hunger meter starts to go down unless of course you're an herbivore then you're eating plants and avoiding getting eaten by other animals.
1604000	1614000	But no matter what animal you're playing as there's always someone bigger that's trying to eat you and you have to stay out of toxic dumps that could be in the city you have to stay away from all these things.
1614000	1625000	So you have all these meters that are constantly draining you have to stay on top of and make sure are full and then you're trying to complete all these micro goals so maybe it's eating and then it's marking your territory.
1626000	1633000	Yes you get to mark your territory in the game and then it's finding a female to mate with and then actually mating with the female.
1634000	1651000	Oh my god Loki I died laughing the first time that scene happened because you play us this little Pomeranian and we found the little female Pomeranian and went to the little nest and it goes all the way up to the dog getting up on his hind legs mounting the female Pomeranian before it fades to black.
1652000	1659000	So there's no thrust but there's definitely the assume the position and I was dying so that was great.
1660000	1671000	And that made me laugh a lot and then you basically you'll start the next generation so in the next generation you get stats passed down to you based on how you did in the first generation.
1672000	1679000	So the key to maxing out your stats is to continue to mate and get all these stats from having played the game.
1680000	1693000	But here's the thing this game is very Japanese in that it's very grindy and I don't mean the animal sex I was just talking about I mean like you know you have a lot of stuff you have to do and it's very unforgiving.
1694000	1704000	Because remember you've got three different meters if one of them drops you're dead you can only live about 15 years I think 20 years at the most if you don't mate within 20 years you're dead.
1704000	1711000	And by the way you have one life when you're dead game over it's all over.
1712000	1719000	So that's like Dark Souls level of unforgiving which is kind of awesome I have to say it kind of you know ramps the pressure up a little bit.
1720000	1730000	But there I will say this there is a way you can get more than one life and it is if you breed and you happen to have like four children you'll run around us a little pack.
1730000	1739000	And if one of you dies then another can take over but because you're running around in a pack one of your pack might have to be a decoy and take the hit so you don't take the hit.
1740000	1746000	So there's all this crap going on that you kind of have to manage I have to say it's pretty damn fun.
1747000	1757000	And you don't really see games like this that are out in America now is it a perfect game no sometimes you can get a little frustrating sometimes it feels a little grindy.
1758000	1766000	I was really irritated with the way that you can only save after you breed because it might take you a good 15 minutes to get from one life cycle to another.
1767000	1775000	And sometimes like I have to quit and save right now and if I don't if I don't save properly my game's gone basically you know you can't do anything about that.
1775000	1790000	So it's unforgivingness is almost a little bit too much but I really support this game and I'm a fan of it because it's totally like Sony is trying something that I think and we've said for a long time here on Orange Lawns Radio should be tried.
1791000	1807000	They took a game that was out as a retail game a $60 game in Japan which I got to say I don't think the game's worth 60 bucks but they made it they translated it they put it out for $15, 12 if you're PlayStation Plus on the PlayStation Network and it's a full fledged game.
1808000	1811000	For $12 it's pretty hard to not appreciate that value.
1812000	1824000	There's about like I think something like 30 different animals you can play as and then of course there's DLC if you want to play as more animals but there's crazy shit like panda bears and you know there's all this like funny stuff.
1825000	1829000	They even had in Japan they actually had it where one of the creatures you get was a salaryman.
1830000	1832000	Yeah I think I think that that happens later on so.
1832000	1839000	SSJ100Matt in our chat says at live.vognetwork.com a game where I can pee and have sex with everything? Sold!
1840000	1841000	Let's see.
1842000	1848000	ActDef says it's Mass Effect with animals. Not quite because there's really no dialogue and that's kind of the big part about Mass Effect.
1849000	1855000	Tigerclaw says when you play as the lions you have to protect the pride from rogue lions that are trying to take over.
1856000	1863000	Yeah that's I mean even when you play as the Pomeranian a beagle might take your ass out in 30 seconds. That's how I got killed the first time.
1864000	1868000	I'm running around doing my thing and then all of a sudden like a beagle jumps out of nowhere and attacks me and kills me. Game over.
1869000	1878000	So if you're the type that throws the controller at the TV and things like that when you get frustrated you may not really be into this game as much.
1879000	1881000	But I love that it's something different.
1881000	1886000	This game won't be for everybody but it's something different. I like it as an arcade style game.
1887000	1893000	So there you go. Tokyo Jungle. Loki you think you might pick this up at some point after hearing me talk about it? Maybe.
1894000	1902000	It's neat. It'll probably be on sale even more in a few months. The weird thing is nobody's really talking about this game. I tried to look up reviews online.
1902000	1910000	I found like three reviews. One great. One average. One negative. So this game is very polarizing I gotta say.
1911000	1915000	But like none of the big sites reviewed it at all and I've hardly read anything about it anywhere.
1916000	1921000	So it really sucks that like Sony's like trying this experiment and it might fail due to lack of promotion.
1922000	1928000	So I'm just saying everybody I'll use what little podcast we have here. If you think you might be interested in this type of game go check out Tokyo Jungle.
1928000	1933000	Cause it's a neat little gem on the Playstation Network.
1934000	1939000	Alright before we get into gaming news for tonight we have some housekeeping. I have quite a bit of housekeeping tonight actually.
1940000	1945000	Does the show sound any different to you tonight? It may or may not. It might be a subtle difference.
1946000	1948000	But we actually have new microphones here in studio.
1949000	1954000	And I'm hoping even though the difference probably won't be that drastic because we still have the same mixing board.
1954000	1961000	You might hear hopefully what if it's done right hopefully you'll hear less popping and hopefully Loki's volume changes won't be as bad.
1962000	1969000	But the nice thing is we're all on like the same mic now. Dan will have his own mic when he comes to guests on the show next time. Hooray.
1970000	1975000	And so I really want to thank Brad from Pod Culture for helping us out with the new microphones.
1976000	1980000	They are kind of hand-me-down microphones but if you've ever listened to Pod Culture their audio is really good.
1980000	1984000	So I was really happy to take on these microphones. So I really want to thank them.
1985000	1989000	They are on Monday nights of the Voice of Geeks Network at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.
1990000	1994000	And they have done a lot. Brad from Pod Culture has done a lot and is very supportive of the projects I've done.
1995000	1999000	He hosts the website for Hoard House. He did those decals or I don't think he did them himself.
2000000	2003000	But he arranged the deal for those decals for Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.
2004000	2007000	So I'm really thankful for all Brad does for the show. So I really want to thank him.
2007000	2011000	I also want to make sure I thank Misty at some point because she played into this too.
2012000	2016000	When she was here visiting for the 10th anniversary she kicked in some financial support for that.
2017000	2022000	So I just really want to acknowledge and appreciate Misty as well as all you guys that tune in to hear it every week.
2023000	2027000	We try to get a little better. Even though we've been on for 10 and a half years now we still try to get better.
2028000	2035000	So hopefully this little new mic thing will go an extra step in making this show even better.
2035000	2040000	Speaking of Pod Culture and all of the Monday Night shows on the Voice of Geeks Network.
2041000	2044000	It is Doctor Who Monday on the Voice of Geeks Network tomorrow.
2045000	2055000	Three shows all talking about Doctor Who. Critical Myth, British Invaders and Pod Culture's special TARDIS Interruptus are all taking on Doctor Who tomorrow.
2056000	2059000	As I understand, now I have to be honest, I haven't seen a lot of the new Doctor Who.
2060000	2064000	I saw some of the Christopher Eccleston episodes but I haven't seen much after that. Although it was really good.
2065000	2066000	I have never seen Doctor Who.
2067000	2070000	I need to sit down and watch it. It is actually really good. At least the older stuff I've seen.
2071000	2075000	But from what I understand there was some controversy around the most recent episode that happened.
2076000	2082000	So I know Critical Myth and Pod Culture and TARDIS Interruptus both want to take that on a little bit.
2083000	2090000	British Invaders which is sandwiched right between the two shows. Back to back shows on the Voice of Geeks Network tomorrow taking on classic Doctor Who.
2090000	2094000	Before the Russell T Davies era going back to the 60's and 70's.
2095000	2097000	So it's a really nice mix of the new and the old tomorrow on VOG.
2098000	2100000	And that's what I love. I love that that's what this network is all about.
2101000	2103000	Is that everybody has a common theme going on. So very cool.
2104000	2108000	That's tomorrow night. Starts at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern with Critical Myth.
2109000	2114000	5 Pacific, 8 Eastern with British Invaders. 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern with Pod Culture.
2114000	2118000	And even if you miss Doctor Who night because you're listening on the podcast feed or what have you.
2119000	2122000	Do check out these excellent shows another time on the network another Monday.
2123000	2124000	And they do rerun throughout the week as well.
2125000	2130000	Also want to plug Umlaud. It is Umlaud season. Can you believe it?
2131000	2137000	Umlaud is the rock band event for charity. It takes place at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco every December.
2138000	2140000	And the fundraising season is in effect for this year.
2140000	2149000	They still need a couple more bands. Very surprising they didn't sell out as fast as they did last year because Tim Schafer is hosting the event this year.
2150000	2152000	That's a huge score for Umlaud. That's amazing.
2153000	2158000	So if you want to have Tim Schafer introduce you on stage, you got to snag one of those band packages right now.
2159000	2165000	There's only a couple left. And I'm thinking just because like gas is like $4.70 a gallon in California right now.
2166000	2169000	People are having trouble saving up that extra money to do the band package.
2170000	2173000	Trust me it is a great cause and a great charity event.
2174000	2180000	So I'm hoping to be involved in one way or another. I will be there for sure one way or another at the event this year.
2181000	2183000	So more information about that coming in future weeks.
2184000	2189000	I've been trying to talk to Seg, one of the organizers. We're really trying to get him on the show at some point.
2190000	2195000	December 6, 2012 is the official date at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco.
2196000	2199000	Thursday and I bet it's going to be streamed on the internet again.
2200000	2204000	Just a bet because it was last year. So I bet they're going to do it again.
2205000	2209000	One other thing. It's a plug. I got a lot tonight. What can I say?
2210000	2216000	It is also awards season in the podcast universe. Podcast awards and Stitcher awards. Two of them this year.
2217000	2221000	You can nominate for the podcast award one time at podcastawards.com.
2222000	2226000	And we really encourage you to nominate Orange Lounge Radio as your best gaming show.
2226000	2233000	We would also really encourage you to consider other VOG programming and other independent programming in the other categories.
2234000	2238000	For example, TV movie. Critical Myth is a great TV movie show.
2239000	2243000	Sci-fi. Pod culture. Mature. Understation Live.
2244000	2247000	And lots of great, great shows on the network to consider for some of these categories.
2248000	2251000	So I really encourage you to do that at podcastawards.com.
2251000	2256000	The Stitcher awards are also having their awards season and you can check that out.
2257000	2262000	The links are available on our Facebook and I will also place those links in chat a little later.
2263000	2264000	And you can nominate once a day for the Stitcher awards.
2265000	2270000	So if you want to nominate multiple show like you want to do. Oh you're like, oh my god there's so many gaming shows I love on the VOG network.
2271000	2274000	I want to nominate them all. You can do Orange Lounge Radio one day. Then Bobby Black Wolf the next day.
2275000	2278000	Then Girls Gone Wow the next day. You know you can kind of cycle through and that'll work.
2278000	2281000	So that is available at stitcher.com.
2282000	2288000	And as I was talking about at the end of Bobby Black Wolf's show, I really think because the iOS 6 podcasting app has not been super well received.
2289000	2294000	Stitcher and all this stuff is really the wave of the future along with TuneIn and other types of iOS.
2295000	2298000	Excuse me, not just iOS but Android and mobile phone apps is really the wave of the future.
2299000	2303000	So I really encourage you guys to help us kind of be on that cutting edge with a nomination.
2303000	2308000	Remember we don't ask for your money for this show. All we ask is to help us with the word of mouth.
2309000	2312000	Okay now we can get into gaming news. Sorry a lot of announcements tonight. What can I say?
2313000	2322000	Alright. Let's talk a little bit about Cliffy B. He is gone. He decided to leave Epic Games.
2323000	2329000	And you know basically it makes sense. He's been doing it since he's been a teenager.
2329000	2333000	And he said outside of my sabbatical last year I've been going nonstop.
2334000	2340000	And you know grew up in this business as Mike Capps likes to say.
2341000	2344000	And now that I'm growing up it's time for a much needed break.
2345000	2351000	So cool. I'm not sure who else is going to be kind of taken over for some of that stuff now that he's gone.
2351000	2361000	But it's cool to see him kind of get his break because he's definitely been busy with Gears of War.
2362000	2370000	I've heard a lot of rumors and this is total fanboy wank but I want to indulge it a little bit at just how wanky this all is.
2371000	2376000	You know which rumor this is right? Like where he went or where he's going? Who offered to buy him? Have you heard this?
2376000	2377000	No.
2378000	2385000	What would be the craziest fanboy company that people hope hired Cliffy B to show how serious they are?
2389000	2390000	Zynga?
2391000	2401000	No, no. Nintendo. There are rumors online that Cliffy B went to Nintendo. Which I, you know, obvious fanboy wank. I don't want to indulge it too much.
2401000	2409000	But you can't help yourself. Like once the seed is planted in your head you're like, God Nintendo really should hire someone like him.
2410000	2418000	It doesn't matter. I don't think it matters because, I don't know. It's just, I don't know what he would be able to do for them.
2419000	2423000	Hopefully make another franchise because seriously they need some new franchises.
2423000	2424000	They need some new franchises.
2425000	2431000	Invent a hardcore franchise? Maybe with some of the characterization, Japanese characterization? I don't know. Maybe I'm crazy but.
2432000	2439000	They've had like hardcore franchises at one point I thought. I don't know.
2440000	2441000	Sin and Punishment?
2442000	2450000	Yeah, Sin and Punishment is pretty awesome. I mean there's that. There's, you know, Eternal Darkness. I mean that was kind of.
2450000	2453000	But none of that on the Wii U. None of it.
2454000	2458000	ActDeft says Cliffy B did get a letter printed in Nintendo Power.
2459000	2465000	So, you know, apparently a lot of people leeching onto that like, oh he's always loved Nintendo. He'd go work for them.
2466000	2477000	Um, cool. I mean, I don't know if the reason he's quitting Epic Games was because he feels like he needs a break.
2478000	2480000	I don't know if he's going to jump right into something else right now.
2481000	2485000	Unless he's just making excuses. Which is kind of a pussy way of doing it. I mean if you ask me.
2486000	2492000	Well, but there's also kind of the right corporate way of doing things and maybe he's going to take a siesta for a few months until the next E3.
2492000	2494000	I'm leaving because Nintendo is about to hire me. Sweet!
2495000	2502000	Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Cliffy B did Nintendo is a real stretch. I wouldn't be surprised if he went to Microsoft though.
2504000	2510000	That's a little more like, okay, realistic category. Or Sony. I could see that happening too.
2512000	2516000	Who knows? Anything's possible. Anything's possible. It's a crazy world. It's a crazy world.
2516000	2528000	Uh, Saig asks a challenging question though. How would he benefit from going to Nintendo? Maybe they offered him houses full of money. I mean, Cliffy B is kind of a rockstar.
2529000	2532000	We've given you a Nintendo DS. It prints money.
2533000	2539000	So, again, I don't want to buy into the fanboy wank too much. I'm not saying I personally believe it.
2539000	2547000	I can definitely see the angle of, shit, you've been doing one thing for 20 years and maybe you just want to change.
2548000	2552000	He's going to go design playgrounds. Just playgrounds with chainsaws attached to them. That kind of thing.
2553000	2561000	But the interesting thing is, the guys at BioWare, the doctors at BioWare did a very similar thing recently. They left the industry after a very long time.
2562000	2563000	I kind of don't think they're going to show up anywhere else.
2563000	2570000	Oh my god. You know what's going on. They're going to make a game company that's like, was it Polytron?
2571000	2574000	Oh, you think all these game journalists that left are going to make...
2575000	2580000	They're going to create the League of Super Game Designers and make this company that'll create, like, something.
2581000	2584000	Yeah, there's that Polygon, which did they ever officially launch?
2584000	2590000	Oh, who gives a fuck. I seriously don't care. It is like the most hipster bullshit company.
2591000	2600000	It's like, hey, we're so cool. We're going to print articles about, we're going to do a documentary about the creation of our company, our website that's not fucking finished yet.
2601000	2603000	No one cares about your fucking website.
2604000	2618000	That, I mean, how fucking, you know, snub-nosed, you know, pompous bullshit is that? I mean, you're just going to create a documentary because you all want to know how this happened. No one fucking cares.
2619000	2624000	Are you saying, you know, the views and opinions of Loki do not express those at Orange Lounge Radio necessarily.
2625000	2626000	So what's your name? Is you really interested in that?
2627000	2628000	But, but, yeah.
2629000	2630000	God, I can't talk to you.
2630000	2637000	I'm going to say I'm not going to touch that with a 10-foot pole. Are you saying that this site has lost itself up its own asshole before it's even launched?
2638000	2638000	
2639000	2640000	Just checking.
2641000	2641000	
2642000	2649000	SSJ 100 Matt is asking, do they print out game ads in Whole Foods and Trader Joe's? Look, I don't want this to be a shade-throwing competition. Look, we're going to walk away from this.
2650000	2660000	But let's talk about the whole idea of the Super Justice League of Game Developers. So you think maybe CliffyBee, BioWare, you know Zynga lost some people this week too.
2661000	2665000	Do you think it could be like the Super League of Mobile Phone Developers?
2666000	2669000	Maybe. What if he went to Apple?
2670000	2671000	Oh, God.
2671000	2681000	He would be, he would be a pretty cool, like, presenter. I mean, because, you know, they need something kind of, you know, with a lot of...
2682000	2683000	Are you saying Tim Cook doesn't have enough energy?
2684000	2685000	No, he doesn't.
2687000	2694000	All right. Anyhow, all right. So CliffyBee's leaving. And so we dedicate this to you, CliffyBee.
2701000	2723000	Let's move on to something. We've gone from a very American company to something very Japanese, but a lot of you love it. It's Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix. You're rolling your eyes over there.
2723000	2732000	I'm rolling my eyes at the name. I mean, seriously, just come up with a better fucking name. 1.5 HD. How's it one and a half? So...
2733000	2739000	I'm going to tell you. I'm so glad you asked, Loki. Here is how Kingdom Hearts 1 is now Kingdom Hearts one and a half. You ready?
2740000	2740000	
2741000	2747000	The screen for each game will rearrange to accommodate for widescreen support, including the HUD rearrangement.
2748000	2749000	No reaction.
2749000	2758000	No reaction. The models for Sora and all his friends have been replaced with ones from Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance, the newest game in the series.
2759000	2765000	Nothing. All right. Trophy support for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.
2766000	2769000	No? Nothing? I thought you were an achievement whore.
2770000	2771000	No, I'm not.
2771000	2780000	Game mechanics have been updated to make the gameplay feel more like Kingdom Hearts 2. Now, in all reality, that could be a good thing if they fixed the camera from the first game.
2781000	2788000	I'm hoping that's the hidden message in there without them wanting to admit that the first game had abort camera. You have to admit, that's a little better, right?
2789000	2790000	It's a nice addition, I guess.
2790000	2801000	All right, there you go. We got something. 70% of the story from 358 slash 2 days will be represented with over 100 new scenes created with full voice acting.
2802000	2806000	Oh! Oh my gosh! Was that an admission from Loki that there might be something worthwhile here?
2807000	2813000	Well, it's all cutscenes from another game because they didn't want to actually port over 358 slash 2 or whatever.
2813000	2828000	Well, I'm so glad you said something about that because Tetsuya Nomura said he originally wanted to do a full remake of the 358 slash 2 days, but he didn't have enough time in production to start a project, thus the decision to utilize theater mode to tell the story.
2829000	2830000	That's kind of lame.
2831000	2832000	Ran out of time?
2833000	2835000	That's lame. That's an excuse. It's just easier to update everything.
2835000	2847000	Well, now, he was asked in this interview with Famitsu, would Kingdom Hearts 2 get the same treatment? And the response was a laugh and, quote, it'd be unusual if there wasn't.
2848000	2850000	Because we've already decided that we're doing that.
2851000	2859000	Well, I bet a lot of it is, how well does this first one sell? If this one sells like crazy, then sure, that's a logical conclusion to get to.
2860000	2863000	Well, then they'll do the PSP games on top of it, you know, for the next one.
2863000	2864000	The Vita?
2865000	2878000	Well, no. No, they'll do the PSP games up rez, because just like they did with, you know, remember, Sony's already on the record saying that they've got a wonderful engine that can, you know, port PSP stuff into HD for, you know, the PS3, so why not?
2879000	2888000	Another quote along the same lines of this whole, does this mean there's a 2.5? Quote, and from Tetsuya Nomura, quote, I figured there were people who had a hard time keeping up with the sequels.
2888000	2899000	We had to start from the beginning with Kingdom Hearts HD. I also thought that familiar fans might make new discoveries seeing everything in chronological order with the sequels side by side. I'm happy to be restarting this title.
2900000	2906000	I don't think it's a problem that people necessarily have problems keeping up with the sequels. It's that people can't keep up with the fucking story.
2906000	2922000	Like, isn't Kingdom Hearts, like, supposed to be aimed at kids? And it's like this, it's, the story is crazy convoluted. Like, I can't even understand it. It's worse than, like, as the world turns. Like, it's crazy.
2925000	2929000	Frisbee in chat asks, how can you remake something that isn't that old?
2930000	2944000	Well, it's, it's, it's getting there, though. By the time this is actually out, you know, 2013 would be about the time frame this is out, right? The first Kingdom Hearts game was, what, 2000, 2003 maybe? About ten years? Nine years, maybe?
2945000	2952000	They remake God of War. Or they'll up-res it. It's not really a remake, it's just up-resing everything.
2953000	2960000	Technus in chat says, Square Enix is kind of like the honey badger of Japanese developers. They just don't give a fuck and just do whatever they feel like doing today.
2961000	2967000	Alan Alchemy says, you can't argue you have no fucking idea what's going on anymore. Here comes a sequel. He's putting that in quotes.
2968000	2977000	I think it's a good idea to have, like, these re-releases because, you know, it's most likely ramping up to a Kingdom Hearts 3 or something like that so they're going to put these re-releases out there so that people kind of have an idea what the fuck's going on.
2978000	2979000	Let the hype train begin.
2979000	2982000	And get back into it and then, you know, go from there.
2983000	2993000	Well, we will see what happens. I love this other comment from Alan Alchemy. P.S. we made figuring out what the fuck was going on very, very hard. We know haters make us famous.
2994000	2998000	Absolutely. Haters make us famous. Let's move on.
2998000	3014000	Alright, so there's a new service that's going to be coming out from Microsoft. Xbox Music. It's supposed to be coming this month and actually launching, I guess, alongside Windows 8, which I'm surprised that so soon is October 26th.
3015000	3017000	Who cares about Windows 8? Go see Silent Hill.
3018000	3033000	And then, of course, it sounds very similar to, like, Pandora. Basically, you know, it's going to be ad-supported and you'll be able to also use, I guess, Windows 8, Xbox 360, Windows Phone.
3034000	3043000	It's going to tie into Microsoft SkyDrive and, I guess, allow you to sync your playlists and music libraries across all the devices and stuff.
3043000	3054000	And, I don't know. Neat. I mean, I'm glad it's free because, you know, I don't want to have to pay for stuff. Ad support is fine.
3055000	3065000	Free is good, but I think, you know, because you're talking about Pandora and there's all these other services Xbox already offers that Xbox Music has to be better than that are also free.
3065000	3074000	Last.fm is available on the 360. iHeartRadio, which is kind of Clear Channel's little Pandora-esque theme, but you can actually listen to over-the-air radio stations with it, too.
3075000	3085000	That's on Xbox 360. So, I think it's logical that they have to kind of put something out free. The subscription model for music isn't really working anymore, which is why I think Apple never ended up doing it.
3086000	3095000	Although, maybe Apple can kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies can't. So, there you go.
3096000	3101000	So, you'll check out Xbox Music. I keep forgetting there is a dashboard update. Like, we're due for one, aren't we?
3101000	3116000	Probably. I'm going to guess at the end of this month. Get it out there so they can start banning people before Modern Warfare 3. No, Black Ops 2 comes out. Halo 4.
3117000	3121000	They want to get those extra security checks in there before all those big games come out.
3122000	3123000	That's a good point. When is Halo 4's release?
3123000	3127000	Halo 4 is the 6th. Black Ops 2 is the 13th of November.
3128000	3133000	November. I guess that makes sense. We are in October now. It'll be just before Halo 4, maybe.
3134000	3135000	Lots of games.
3136000	3145000	Yep. We'll get to the release date soon enough. Something else on the Xbox 360. One company is claiming that they are going to be soon heard on the Xbox 360 and seen.
3145000	3153000	It's the site U-Porn. Never heard of this site. Can you believe that? A pornography site I haven't heard of. It's U-Porn. Oh, really?
3154000	3156000	I have the app on my Boxee Box.
3157000	3160000	So, you can see some Boxee Box on your Boxee Box?
3161000	3163000	Except they don't ever use it because it's terrible.
3164000	3172000	But, yeah. It's one of the... Come on. The Boxee Box had all these different repositories that you can get and a lot of them were porn.
3173000	3178000	So, I had to download all the porn ones that were free because I'm not paying for fucking porn. Not doing it.
3179000	3185000	But, yeah. We checked it out. It just links to their website. It looks exactly the same as the other one.
3185000	3193000	It's a streaming website for porn. Of course, the name implies the YouTube of porn, sort of.
3194000	3200000	Well, they posted an entry to their blog. Let's see. Quote... Oh, my gosh. Wait. I got to read this from chat.
3201000	3208000	AlphaKananagram in our chat room at live.fognetwork.com says, Rob, I remember y'all talking about U-Porn on Guys on a Show.
3209000	3213000	I'm pretty sure that was the site y'all went to for, quote, Japanese Fart Girl.
3214000	3219000	How do you remember that? That's amazing. You remember things about my life I don't remember.
3220000	3226000	And U-Porn was also the website that we visited on your Wii using the Wii web browser to find pterodactyl porn.
3227000	3228000	I thought that was PornTube.
3229000	3232000	They're all the fucking same. I don't know. It was one of those.
3232000	3236000	All right. Well, anyhow, here's the quote from U-Porn's blog.
3237000	3241000	Gamers and free porn lovers around the world rejoice. Yay!
3242000	3245000	Thanks at long last to the introduction of Internet Explorer for Xbox.
3246000	3251000	You can now tap into and stream all your favorite free U-Porn videos right from your Xbox.
3252000	3259000	Whether you're pwning noobs in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, annihilating Bullymong in Borderlands 2, or taking the saints deep in Madam NFL 13,
3259000	3265000	you're never more than a few simple controller clicks away from being face deep in hot free porn.
3268000	3271000	Yes, because we all have the internet, so it's no big deal.
3272000	3277000	Yay! So all they're really saying is, we can't wait for Internet Explorer on the Xbox 360.
3278000	3281000	Who says it's gonna fucking work with your website anyways? Because it's Internet Explorer!
3282000	3285000	I mean, it's like, that's not guaranteed to work with anything.
3285000	3297000	I mean, I would hope that's HTML5, but I mean, come on. We know better than, you know, all these, you know, different web browsers for stuff don't necessarily work with the porn sites.
3298000	3305000	Now, granted, the PlayStation 3 browser works well with porn sites, the Wii browser works well with the porn sites, so it is, they kind of have to at this point.
3306000	3310000	But yes. And with that news, though, VoG Network is also on your Xbox 360, because...
3310000	3313000	There you go. It should work, it's HTML5, so it should work.
3314000	3316000	Assuming that Internet Explorer 8 works with HTML5.
3317000	3320000	Are you gonna be able to code a website to show up like an Xbox channel?
3321000	3325000	Or, not 8, 10. Um, maybe, I don't know about that.
3326000	3328000	Because we should make a VoG channel if that's possible. But anyway.
3329000	3330000	I don't think it works that way.
3331000	3333000	That'll happen as soon as the new OLR PSP debuts.
3335000	3337000	Yeah, except the PSP's over, so...
3337000	3344000	Oh, Bobby in Chat says it does not stream on the Xbox 360 Internet Explorer. I tried. I guess he's in some developer thing.
3345000	3347000	Oh, yeah, he has the X and A thing, so, yeah.
3348000	3350000	So, we need to make it work, wah!
3351000	3356000	Alright, anyway. The official response from Microsoft, who are quick to distance themselves from this.
3357000	3367000	To be clear, we are adding Internet Explorer to Xbox Live, not specific adult content providers like YouPorn or any other specific website content.
3368000	3373000	Additionally, we give members and parents the option to turn this feature on or off for their accounts.
3374000	3378000	Access to Internet Explorer for all child accounts is blocked by default.
3379000	3382000	They want to get far away from a scandal ASAP.
3382000	3388000	And who can blame them? Because honestly, you know, if Fox News got a hold of this little spiel here...
3389000	3392000	Oh, they've done it with every single console that has a stupid web browser.
3393000	3398000	It's a porn box! Xbox! Triple Xbox! I think they've already done that before.
3399000	3402000	They'd have a pornography expert on with commentating, you know, whatever.
3403000	3409000	I think they've already done that too before with, like, the Windows Media Center streaming or something like that.
3409000	3417000	Because you used to build these Windows Media Center to, like, view what's on your computer and stream Internet Explorer or Firefox or something like that.
3418000	3426000	Good Lord, Jason in chat says, Not to beat a dead horse, but Rob mentioned YouPorn in an Unprotected 6 too, I thought, referencing my old, old YouTube project.
3427000	3432000	What? I swear I have not heard of YouPorn, although I'm old and I forget things, so whatever.
3433000	3438000	Some folks in chat, I think, kind of wondering if maybe the Kinect would allow you to make your own porn and you could upload it.
3439000	3442000	It would look terrible. That camera is not good.
3443000	3452000	Alright. Frisbee in chat says, I'm an Internet expert and I just found out that boobies are online.
3453000	3456000	Maybe I'm doing the show topless right now.
3457000	3459000	Alright, Loki.
3461000	3463000	Seriously, porn, porn, porn.
3464000	3465000	The Internet is for porn.
3466000	3468000	I mean, come on. The Internet is for porn.
3469000	3476000	So, apparently there are cheating allegations in the League of Legends playoffs. Basically...
3477000	3481000	First you tell me there's boobs on the Internet and now you're going to tell me there's cheating?
3482000	3483000	I know, it's so crazy.
3484000	3492000	Well, here's the most ridiculous part of the whole thing, is that they would even set it up that you could cheat.
3492000	3506000	Basically, it looks like what happened was, I think it was screen hacking, which is basically looking at someone else's screen to, you know, look at their HUD and stuff like that to figure out where other people are on their mini-map.
3507000	3513000	Basically, one of the referees said, we keep a constant watch on all the players on stage at all times.
3514000	3518000	We have cameras as well as live people walking on the stage to keep tabs on everything.
3518000	3525000	All players are told that they either remain sitting, facing forward with headphones on at all times, including during pauses.
3526000	3537000	I can confirm that no WEE player looked at the mini-map at any point during the match, although they have a screenshot showing otherwise.
3538000	3540000	So, I don't know.
3541000	3543000	But, here's my thing.
3543000	3557000	If you're going to set up a tournament like that, and I didn't watch it live, so I don't know how exactly they're set up, but wouldn't you think that you would put the players in a way that they wouldn't be able to see the mini-map showing the other team?
3558000	3569000	Just a thought, you know, maybe so that they can't look at, you know, the other team's screen, or they can't look at something that's being broadcast on, like, a giant screen in an arena or wherever the fuck this is.
3569000	3575000	So, don't give them the opportunity, then you don't have to worry about them fucking, you know, cheating.
3576000	3580000	Little mirrors on the side of my glasses allow me to see behind me and around me.
3581000	3584000	I mean, seriously, it's just... it's stupid.
3585000	3590000	But, it's for two million dollars, so of course some people are going to try to, you know, whatever they can do.
3590000	3596000	And there was, you know, they were talking a little bit about, you know, what kind of made them suspect stuff.
3597000	3610000	Like, it ended up where one team was, I guess, pinging a spot in the map or whatever where the other team was, and basically there was no way for them to have known that those guys were there, but they knew that the players were coming from that direction or something like that.
3611000	3613000	So, it's like, eh, wait a second, that's a little weird.
3613000	3618000	Well, what if it's just that, you know, maybe you kind of read up on the competition and maybe you know their strategies and stuff.
3619000	3627000	Like, I know those might be kind of a stretch here, but what if, you know, they just kind of... that's where they wanted to investigate and it was just a coincidence.
3628000	3632000	I mean, maybe I'm giving it too much credit, I'll be honest, but I don't know. It could happen.
3633000	3637000	I think you have to look at both sides. You don't want to just automatically assume everybody's a cheater.
3638000	3652000	Yeah, because here's one of the comments. They said, Azubu Frost did the same thing, only they paused the game, checked the map, and saw that the enemy team was going to ambush them, trying to counter the tactic that Azubu used in the past with the pause.
3653000	3662000	Azubu managed to mysteriously ping the exact brush TSM was in at the same time they were there, just after the pause. Coincidentally, eh?
3662000	3669000	So, I mean, it sounds like that they were... I don't know. A little funny business is going on.
3670000	3671000	Very interesting.
3672000	3685000	But once again, you know, okay, apparently what it was is the map was being projected behind the players, you know, so people can see it and stuff, but put a fucking screen or something, you know, put that in a projection screen that's in front of the team.
3686000	3690000	Oh yeah, because you could maybe see the reflection in the monitor or something. It would be very easy.
3690000	3712000	It just... come on, you're running a two million dollar tournament and you can't have decent... you're gonna go that, you know, that ghetto cheap on that stuff to where, oh well, you know, you know, people... fuck, even in regular tournaments that run well, people are gonna accuse other people of cheating. Just don't give them the opportunity. Especially when this much money is on the line.
3713000	3725000	Sometimes you don't think of everything. I don't know. Being devil's... we talked about... on Horde House this week we talked about a Guild Warcraft contest that went a little wrong because, you know, they didn't think about every possible thing that could happen.
3726000	3732000	Not to mention that they also... I think there was an issue where someone was D.O.S.ing the servers they were trying to use for...
3733000	3733000	
3734000	3739000	...for something, so they moved to, like, some different servers or something. I don't know. Fun!
3739000	3760000	Alright, well let's move on. Something completely different. Something you can play with online to make your own chiptune music. I like little creative sites like this and this is pretty cool because this website kind of looks like a Game Boy and you can, you know, sequence your own tones, play them back, and save things to a WAV file so you can make your own cool little chiptunes.
3760000	3775000	It is called Pulse Boy, if you want to check it out. It's pulseboy.com and I think it's called that because it looks like a Game Boy. It was made by Roger Hicks. So if you feel like kind of just messing around making your own chip... excuse me, your own chiptune songs, you can check out that website.
3776000	3786000	I don't know what else to say about it, but it looks pretty cool. I haven't had time to play with it myself yet, but I like those music making types of programs. Especially since there hasn't been a new Mario Paint.
3786000	3802000	That is a crime. They need to have that with a tablet controller. Come on. Still no Mario Paint. But now they have Art Academy. That's why. It's Art Academy now. Who cares? Mario Paint. I don't want Art Academy, I want Mario Paint.
3802000	3819000	Besides, there's GarageBand. You ever play GarageBand? Well it's not really a play thing, but it's a music making thing on the Apple products. Oh wow, the Apple products. Let me pull out all my... oh wait, don't have any because I don't buy expensive pieces of crap. I thought you had an iPod Touch. Yeah, don't use it.
3820000	3830000	And I'm not paying twenty bucks for their fucking GarageBand. Five bucks. Five bucks. Might as well be twenty bucks. I had gift cards. Stop judging me. I'm not paying for anything.
3831000	3845000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that are coming out soon near you. This week is actually quite a bit because we're getting into the fall stuff and of course today Pokemon Black version 2 and Pokemon White version 2 out on the Nintendo DS.
3846000	3857000	Naughty Bear Double Trouble for the Playstation 3 includes Naughty Bear Gold Edition and Naughty Bear Trouble in Paradise. Both I'm sure are very underwhelming. Oh I love Naughty Bear, said nobody ever.
3858000	3876000	Yeah, pretty much. We played the original. It was terrible. Spy Hunters coming back on the Vita and 3DS. Just Dance 4 out this week on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii. Dragon Ball Z for Kinect. So now you can be over 9000.
3877000	3899000	Code of Princess for the 3DS. Also Harry Potter for Kinect. Monster 4x4 for the 3DS. The cool game this week Dishonored on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. And let's see, XCOM Enemy Unknown on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3900000	3904000	I can't believe that series is coming back and it's probably going to look nothing like the original.
3905000	3920000	The new one, well this is the strategy one so they don't have the third person shooter one yet. And then Fabled the Journey on Xbox 360 for Kinect. And god I wonder if that sucks or not. I haven't seen any reviews for that yet. But that's it.
3921000	3941000	Alright well traveling to Japan some of the same stuff on the Xbox 360 over there Dishonored. It comes out on the 360 October 11th as well as Fabled the Journey. Something must be going on with Rocksmith because there's a new cable and a cable bundle that are coming out in Japan as well. So Rocksmith must be landing in Japan. Either it already has or it's landing there soon.
3942000	3957000	On the Playstation 3 pretty much all the same stuff I just named. Oh no just Dishonored in the Rocksmith thing. The other one isn't happening. But they also have Toki Toa comes out as well in a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack. Kind of interesting.
3958000	3970000	Anyhow I don't know what this is. This is some type of like a wedding is supposed to be a joyous occasion for Princess Toki and her knight. However the sneaky witch predicts that somebody is going to die at her wedding. Well that's kind of a downer isn't it?
3972000	3991000	God this is kind of fucked up. To find out the connection between the witch, the assassin who crashed her wedding and to prevent her knight from dying, Toki and Toa travel back time 6 months before the wedding. The smooth transition between anime scenes and the battlefield gives gamers the illustration that they are being zapped into the game. Sounds like it could be kind of a neat concept actually.
3992000	4007000	Which means we'll probably never see it here. Oh it's kind of like a fighting game with the 1, 2, 3 combos and all that. It's pretty cool. Interesting. The art style on that is very automatic. I can see what they're talking about there. But yeah probably won't be seeing that here anytime soon but you never know.
4008000	4033000	Let's see. On the Playstation Vita, nothing this week but you do have FIFA 13 to look forward to on the 18th. And going to the 3DS real quick. There's a few things, quite a few things. Project X Zone, a Nintendo 3DS LL in blue and black which I believe is the XL. Bravely Default Flying Fairy from Square Enix. No idea what that could be but there you go.
4034000	4052000	And Game of the Week for many people I'm sure. Hello Kitty, Toa Iso, Block Crash Z. That means like Hello Kitty is like the Kool-Aid Man crashing through some blocks. I guess that's what that's all about. That's on the 3D. Still no mouth. Yes on the 3DS.
4053000	4068000	Going to the European release dates since Stark Soccer is not here. I'll try to jump in there and check out the European release dates. On October the 12th Dishonored on the 360, Playstation 3 and PC. Fabled the Journey on the Xbox 360.
4068000	4093000	Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 on October 12th. Rocksmith on the 360 and Playstation 3. Is that the initial release of the game there? Maybe they didn't have it before. WRC 3 on the Vita, Playstation 3, PC and 360. And XCOM Enemy Unknown across the 360, PS3 and PC. So a lot of the same stuff in Europe that we're getting here so they don't have to wait for a lot of that.
4093000	4107000	Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. I was going to add one more thing though. I got some news this week that was pretty awesome. And what's that? Cause my rep over at D3 knows I'm a huge Earth Defense Force fan.
4107000	4125000	Earth Defense Force 3 portable came out in Japan on the 27th of September. Being localized coming out over here February 12th as Earth Defense Force 2017 portable. Hell yes. Hooray! You're happy. I don't have to import it!
4126000	4138000	We knew there was a cult enough fandom for it here right? Oh yeah. You're not the only one that loves this series. I can't wait. And Earth Defense Force 4 hopefully is right around the corner. That I may import depending on how long it takes to get over here.
4138000	4151000	Well then I'm going to throw something out here too that was not in the news otherwise. And that is that it's confirmed that there's more DLC coming for Mass Effect for multiplayer. And it looks like one of the most robust ones they've done yet.
4151000	4159000	Like I guess there's going to be overall 16 new classes which seems crazy to me. I think they're rolling it out slowly or something. I think there's only 4 to start and then there will be more.
4159000	4174000	But new maps. It's some of the older maps with weather effects now and the weather will impact some things. But one of the biggest things that really surprised me. A fourth enemy race. Which is really cool and what the game could really use some of.
4174000	4186000	So you have the Geth, you have the Cerberus, you have the Reapers and now you're going to have the Collectors. Which was a big part of Mass Effect 2. That's coming back. So that's awesome.
4186000	4199000	I don't think we have a date for that yet do we? No maybe we do. It might be as soon as this Tuesday actually. I think it's coming out really soon. BioWare tends to announce these things and it's like by the way next week. Yay!
4200000	4214000	Cool. So this is very sad. Apparently Sony is suing the fictional character Kevin Butler. And by suing the fictional character actually suing the actor that plays him, Jerry Lambert.
4215000	4223000	And apparently this is also, I think this has to do with their new commercial that he's in for Bridgestone. Because they're also suing them as well.
4223000	4238000	Basically he's playing Mario Kart on the Wii for that commercial. And so apparently I guess later on they edited the commercial and removed him from it entirely.
4238000	4251000	Which is kind of weird. And then I guess perhaps maybe there's some sort of clause or something that he couldn't be seen selling other products.
4251000	4264000	They said the use of Kevin Butler character to sell products other than those from Playstation misappropriates Sony's intellectual property and creates confusion in the market and causes damage to Sony.
4265000	4282000	Although I don't think he was, I don't know if it was actually, he wasn't playing Kevin Butler in the commercial. He's just an actor. You can't sue because he's playing a different character that happens to be playing a video game or something like that.
4282000	4286000	It's not like he's like, I'm Kevin Butler with Sony. I'm playing Mario Kart.
4286000	4297000	Yeah, yeah, he didn't do that. But I mean, people did notice it was him and I'm sure there's a lot of people doing a double take. But it's like actors have to work and they have to take whatever jobs are offered to them.
4297000	4308000	And if Sony cut him loose, then he should be free to look for other work elsewhere playing other characters. Like he can't not play a manager for the rest of his life because people might think it's the Sony guy.
4308000	4323000	Like, I don't know, that seems a little messed up to me. I think people usually know enough to know like, oh, it's the same guy. Maybe it's because Sony was trying to push so hard that Kevin Butler was like a real thing when they brought him out of the press conference a few years ago and so forth at E3.
4323000	4327000	Like maybe that's more what they're worried about, but that's kind of Sony that built that up, right?
4327000	4346000	Yeah, it's weird though because, I mean, at no point, from what I remember, at no point in that commercial did they ever refer to him as Kevin or refer to him as, like, anything. I don't know, it's just, it's weird.
4346000	4356000	Like, you know, most people know how to differentiate actors from one project to another. Like, just because somebody plays a villain in one movie doesn't mean they're like always a villain. Although I guess some people get, you know, typecast.
4356000	4358000	Like Daniel Radcliffe is not fucking Harry Potter.
4358000	4359000	That's right, you're right, exactly.
4359000	4360000	He's not Harry-
4360000	4364000	That's why he did that play with the nudie stuff, is he wanted to do something as-
4364000	4378000	Women in Black is not Harry Potter and the Woman in Black. It is fucking, you know, a totally different movie. Just like, you know, just because this guy is in a commercial doesn't mean it's fucking Kevin Butler. And so that's my problem is, like, how can they even sue over this?
4378000	4381000	I mean, they can do whatever they want with her because they're Sony and they can bully whatever, you know.
4382000	4392000	Of course, I'll never forget the time I went to the theater. This was many years ago. I don't even remember what it was we were seeing, but I was with my friend Billy, who was a hoot and a holler. He was my old roommate when I lived in Chico, California.
4392000	4401000	And we went to the movies and, you know, we're watching and then there's this new actress that pops on the screen in one scene and Billy goes very loudly, like, so the whole theater could hear,
4401000	4420000	that's the woman that shot Selena. Like, she's an actress, okay. She had to take on a role of a person not a lot of people really care for, you know. Let her be other parts in other movies.
4420000	4432000	Like, when I watched Battlestar Galactica, I didn't go, oh, Selena's dad is a spaceship captain now. Wasn't that the teacher from Stand and Deliver?
4432000	4447000	Anyhow, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, Chiggers asks, can that guy ever do another commercial without thinking of him being Kevin Butler?
4447000	4452000	Well, I guess Loki gave a good example. Can you ever think of Daniel Radcliffe as anything but Harry Potter?
4452000	4474000	He's been in like other things, you know, the guy, let's play, you know, plays the fictional character Kevin Butler, but I was just really quickly, I was trying to watch the commercial real quick to see if he's got a name tag or if they refer to him as, actually, I'm going to do this real quick.
4475000	4484000	Well, let me read some other comments while you're working there. Frisbee in chat says, anyone who thinks Mario Kart is a Sony product, those people are crazy, yo.
4484000	4497000	DungeonBuster says, it was funny seeing him push the Wii in the commercial, though. DungeonBuster says, the only thing I could think of was, it's nice to see Kevin Butler having fun with the Wii. Damn, I need new tires.
4497000	4504000	Success, the commercial was a success. It got you to think about tires and that you might need to take a trip to the tire store.
4504000	4512000	SJ100Matt says, all I have to say is, no one cares about the dude you got a Dell guy anymore.
4514000	4523000	Yeah, they don't, they don't, they don't really even refer to him at all by any name at all. I mean, it's just, he's playing a character, so this whole lawsuit is fucking retarded.
4524000	4538000	And I feel bad, after all the good shit, I mean, he was, he was like a spokesperson for, you know, Sony that actually kind of got people excited about Sony's stuff, and here's the way they go and treat him. Yeah, thanks.
4538000	4548000	Sony's had a lot of missteps in their advertising over the years, and Kevin Butler was one of the things they did right, and then they end it. They end it, and then they go, they go, they end it and then take a dump on it.
4548000	4563000	Hey, we're gonna fucking sue you because you're in a commercial for Bridgestone, playing a Wii. It's like, dude, you're the one that fucking let him go, you stupid idiot. He could have been still pitching, you know, Sony stuff, but you just said, eh, fuck it, we're getting rid of him.
4563000	4578000	Now, Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room says, actors generally have non, he's the voice of realism here, actors generally have non-compete clauses about not directly or indirectly promoting a competing product when they do ad work for a certain time.
4578000	4591000	He might have violated his non-compete clause, which was in the contract that his agent should have known, but not him. But technically, I mean, just to play devil's advocate, technically, it was for the tire shop. The ad was not for a Wii, it was for the tire shop.
4591000	4620000	Yeah. So that's, that's where things get a little fuzzy wuzzy here. Like, I mean, what if he's, what if this Kevin Butler, keep calling Kevin Butler, it's not fucking Kevin Butler, it's an actual person. No, but what if, for example, you know, they, uh, he walks past, you know, what if Jerry Lambert walks past, like, an Xbox 360 or something that happens to be on, or they go, oh, whoa, hold on, you were, you were too close to another console.
4620000	4627000	We're going to sue you. I mean, what if he gets a sitcom role or something like that and his kids are playing a fucking Xbox 360 or something?
4627000	4646000	What Bobby's saying in chat, though, does make sense. I mean, like, okay, for example, Catherine Zeta-Jones was T-Mobile for how many years, right? Like, she was the reason a lot of people went to T-Mobile. She was a great spokesperson for that company. Why they ever let her go, I'll never know. But, like, it's not like she started doing commercials for AT&T right after that, you know?
4646000	4662000	Anyhow, but at the same time, if she, if she's talking on a cell, if she's talking on an iPhone in a movie, can T-Mobile sue her because they don't have the iPhone? That might be stretching it a little bit, right?
4662000	4669000	It's, I think it's ridiculous. But apparently, apparently, if there's anything out of it, they're going to try to settle out of court, so.
4669000	4671000	All right.
4671000	4673000	It's, it's stupid.
4673000	4686000	All right, one more news story for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, and this has to do with a old class, ironically, into the classic game of the week. This is not the classic game of the week, although I think it should be if it hasn't been yet at some point.
4686000	4695000	Suikoden, one and two. Great PlayStation role-playing games. Actually, there were five of them, but a lot of people remember very fondly the first two that were on PlayStation.
4695000	4709000	And this Facebook group, the Suikoden Revival movement, is a group that's trying to organize to get Konami's attention to get Suikoden one and two available on PlayStation Network worldwide.
4709000	4718000	Now I was trying to get to the bottom of this because I'm like, wait a minute. I have Suikoden on PlayStation Network. I bought it several years ago, so I know that's already there.
4718000	4724000	But this is, I suppose, a campaign to get it done worldwide. My understanding is that Suikoden one is not available in Europe.
4724000	4733000	Suikoden two is kind of a rare game, too. I mean, like, people pay a lot of money to get copies of that game if you can actually find it anywhere.
4733000	4740000	So it would be, although it would suck for the collectors to have it devalued a little bit, it's not like that kind of stuff hasn't happened before.
4740000	4748000	So a lot of people asking, well, where's Suikoden two, which some people say was the best that was in the series. It is a little odd that that is missing.
4748000	4758000	So there is a fan campaign going on on Facebook, and it's basically, you know, kind of like Operation Rainfall-esque, where it's like, bug Konami on Twitter on Tuesday.
4758000	4765000	Bug Konami on Facebook on Friday, and like, just keep banging down their door until they get you what you want to shut you up.
4765000	4773000	Facebook.com slash Suikodenrevival is the place to check that out. S-U-I-K-O-D-E-N-R-E-V-I-V-A-L.
4773000	4780000	If you feel like joining in on the campaign, which I bet Shane is going to sign up for right now, although he probably already has the games on PlayStation.
4780000	4783000	Wasn't there PSP remakes in Japan, too? I think I remember that.
4783000	4784000	Ah, maybe.
4784000	4793000	And then, is one and two really good enough, or don't you want three, four, and five at some point, now that they're putting PlayStation 2 games out on the, uh, PlayStation Network?
4793000	4794000	Eh?
4794000	4795000	Alright.
4795000	4803000	Well, let's move on to a time when gaming was a lot simpler, and you didn't get to petition companies to tell them what you want.
4803000	4807000	You took what you wanted, you took what you got, and you liked it.
4807000	4809000	It's the classic game of the week.
4810000	4816000	Every week on the show, Dark Sakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.
4816000	4819000	But she's not here. She's too busy on the Matterhorn.
4819000	4824000	So I'm jumping in and taking the classic game, because Loki never told me if he wanted to do it.
4824000	4832000	Alright, so I'm going to do the classic game tonight, and I try to pick things that I think Dark Sakura may not have heard of, and things that I remember from my past.
4832000	4837000	So the classic game of the week I picked this week is an edutainment title, a little different.
4837000	4841000	It's called The Island of Dr. Brain is my classic game of the week.
4843000	4850000	Now, really we should kind of consider Dr. Brain as a series, because The Island of Dr. Brain was not really the first game in this series.
4850000	4853000	The Castle of Dr. Brain was the first game in this series.
4853000	4857000	But, um, Dr. Brain was a series that had, I think, four games in it.
4857000	4866000	There was, um, uh, there was The Island of Dr. Brain, The Castle of Dr. Brain was before that, and then later on, like about three years later, we had The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain.
4866000	4870000	And The Time Warp of Dr. Brain, although I don't remember those games as fondly.
4870000	4882000	And I think part of that is because Sierra, who actually created those first two games, uh, created those in-house, but then they acquired Bright Star Technology, who was known for educational games.
4882000	4887000	It got turned over to them, they made The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain and The Time Warp of Dr. Brain.
4887000	4899000	So, um, Dr. Brain is an absent-minded professor, and, uh, basically the idea to the, in the games is to kind of follow Dr. Brain and kind of find him wherever he is.
4899000	4907000	Obviously, The Island of Dr. Brain is kind of a play on The Island of Dr. Moreau, like the classic movie that then they remade into a terrible movie, and so forth.
4907000	4919000	Um, later on, they actually remade this whole series into like more of an action-oriented game, which was Dr. Brain thinking games and action-reaction, but I'm not really acknowledging those.
4919000	4923000	Let me go back to The Island of Dr. Brain, which is the game I wanted to talk about tonight.
4923000	4929000	Um, The Island of Dr. Brain was, um, kind of a adventure-ish game.
4929000	4939000	The, the cool thing about it is it felt like a lot of the old Sierra games around that time, and kind of had that same look to it, where you were adventuring and exploring things in the different screens and such.
4939000	4946000	But you had many different puzzles that you had to solve to get further and further in The Island, and there were many types of different puzzles.
4946000	4955000	There was, um, there was like, um, uh, like Tetris, Tetro-Teturino Onimo, I forget what they call those, those types of puzzles.
4955000	4960000	The classic Tower of Babel-style puzzles, where you're moving the little towers from one pole to another.
4960000	4973000	Graphing calculator puzzles, where you had to get the exact, thank you, Tetromino, uh, where you had to get the, um, graph to draw just right to separate the four types of little amoebas under the microscope.
4973000	4978000	Um, latitude and longitude puzzles, there were all these different types of puzzles in the game.
4978000	4989000	And, um, basically, in the plot of the game, the plans for the latest project were stolen, and you have to get the battery from The Island and bring it to Dr. Brain to basically fix the situation.
4989000	4994000	There's security puzzles that Dr. Brain set up all over The Island, though, that is what you're solving.
4994000	5003000	So, uh, yeah, it was a Sierra game, it was for DOS back in 1992, and although it was kind of an educational title, I don't know, I kind of like puzzle games.
5003000	5007000	It kind of set the precedent, um, for a lot of, like, fun, uh, puzzle games.
5007000	5010000	So, that's really it, that's all I have to say about it.
5010000	5016000	There's not a lot else to say, it's, it's got a variety of different types of puzzles in it, and it's, it's worth checking out.
5016000	5021000	And the, uh, prequel as well, The Castle of Dr. Brain was also a solid entry in the series.
5021000	5025000	So there you go, this week's classic game of the week, The Island of Dr. Brain.
5026000	5032000	Check out those old school voiceovers right there with the ad-lib music in the background.
5035000	5036000	Good times.
5039000	5041000	The Island of Dr. Brain, did you ever play that one?
5041000	5042000	I did not play that game.
5042000	5044000	I'm wasting many hours on that game.
5044000	5045000	It's a fun game.
5045000	5048000	There's different skill levels, too, so the puzzles can get really hard.
5048000	5053000	Like, I think the Tower of Babel puzzle in the advanced mode takes, like, 450 moves to solve.
5053000	5054000	Crazy.
5055000	5059000	Alright, that's gonna do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5059000	5066000	We have plenty more of show to come, including rapid-fire news, the FUGL Question of the Week, emails, if we got any,
5066000	5072000	there weren't any in there last time I looked, uh, the FUs of the Week, and of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5072000	5077000	Maybe you have something to say about this whole Kevin Butler situation, or Cliffy B leaving Epic Games,
5077000	5080000	or porn on the 360, or whatever you want to talk about.
5080000	5085000	We'll be taking your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5085000	5088000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5088000	5095000	We are live with episode number 476 of our show for this October the 7th of 2012.
5095000	5099000	Just myself and Loki holding down the fort tonight, if you're just joining us, DarkSakura.
5099000	5106000	She is at the happiest place on Earth, which is even happier today, uh, with the gay days Anaheim going on right now.
5106000	5109000	I know a lot of people that are there right now.
5109000	5111000	Uh, and you might be wondering, why aren't you there?
5111000	5115000	Um, my pass expired for Disney. I had an annual pass for Disneyland.
5115000	5120000	It actually expired at the end of September, so I wouldn't have been able to make it.
5120000	5126000	And, um, it's like $450 or something to renew right now, which, you know, if I was in a better financial situation,
5126000	5130000	I'd spend it, because that's, you know, Disneyland's a great place.
5130000	5134000	But, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna use the excuse to kind of take some time off from Disney for a while.
5134000	5138000	I was just there two weeks ago, anyway. That was the point, was to be like the last hurrah.
5138000	5143000	So, uh, but, uh, Jamie, she's, she's enjoying it for now, uh, while I'm on a little bit of hiatus,
5143000	5149000	and, uh, she'll be back next week to pick a new Classic Game of the Week and do all the things she does on the show.
5149000	5151000	But, meanwhile, Loki and I holding down the fort.
5151000	5156000	Alright, Loki, you gotta tell the, uh, listeners what you were telling me during the break about your shopping excursions here.
5156000	5163000	I'm not shopping on anything. No, I, I'm making some, well, designing something right now.
5163000	5166000	Sorry, plotting. You're plotting something over there, clearly.
5166000	5175000	Not necessarily shopping. Uh, so, no, I was, um, you know, I'm always looking for, like, DDR machines and stuff like that.
5175000	5178000	So, one of the things I wanted to do was rebuild my, you know, DDR pads.
5178000	5181000	And, you know, I, I kind of saw only all the designs that are out there and stuff.
5181000	5187000	I actually had bought stuff to make a certain, uh, design, but I just kind of don't want to do that one anymore.
5187000	5198000	So, I happened to catch, there was, um, on the, on BomaniSau's, um, site, they were, uh, some guy was selling one of his beat gear pads.
5198000	5207000	And now, if you don't remember, beat gear pads, at one time, there was a guy that was gonna be creating the most arcade authentic pads, you know, out there.
5207000	5210000	And then we played some awesome music, and it was fantastic.
5210000	5218000	Okay, I guess, um, I guess, uh, it was appropriate, since Loki's talking about old games, to play the classic Game of the Week music. Sorry about that.
5218000	5232000	Uh, so anyways, so this guy's selling, um, you know, the beat gear pad, and, uh, they've got some shots of it and stuff, and that kind of linked to another website that had some more shots of the pad, and, like, it taking apart and stuff like that.
5232000	5247000	So, based on those pictures, I'm designing the schematics for it to make my own, or to mass produce them if I want to, since no one has done it. And, yeah, so that's why I'm working on it.
5247000	5249000	But you wouldn't scam people out of their money.
5249000	5251000	No.
5251000	5253000	You're an honest guy, and I know where you live.
5253000	5265000	Exactly, everyone knows where I live. No, um, I just, I was kind of curious to see how much it's gonna cost to do it, and how I would actually have to do it, because I think it's all, it looked like it was injected molded plastic and stuff.
5265000	5275000	And they use different sensors than, like, arcade sensors. They use, uh, they're tape switches, or what they're called, I guess, and you can actually buy those really cheap.
5275000	5290000	They come in, like, a big, long, like, a big, long string of them, and it's, like, uh, I think I found them, like, ten bucks for, like, eight feet of that stuff, and you'd only need, like, a few inches, um, per pad.
5290000	5298000	Maybe a few feet per pad. Um, but, I mean, ten bucks for, you know, a ton of switches versus ten bucks a switch.
5299000	5310000	Kind of a, kind of a big deal there. But, um, yeah, so, arcade parts, they actually use the arcade arrows. They use, um, the way I'm designing is gonna use the arcade, um, neons as well.
5310000	5317000	Um, and I don't know about the arcade switches, because those are really fucking expensive. I'd rather go the tape switch route.
5317000	5320000	You'll always be the DDR fan, now and forever.
5320000	5324000	Exactly. I always am. All I have the stuff I do is for DDR stuff.
5324000	5326000	I did it for the dinner!
5326000	5333000	But, yeah, so, that's what I've been working on. Actually, that's what I've been working on this week, uh, last few days, and I've been playing Minecraft or anything, or Borderlands 2,
5333000	5345000	because I've been, uh, playing in SketchUp, trying to draw what I see, and getting the measurements right based on other things that are injection molded and stuff like that.
5345000	5353000	You know, they have the support braces and stuff in there. Um, just getting that the right size, and I think I have nailed it pretty well.
5353000	5359000	Um, just knowing measurements of different things. So, we'll see.
5359000	5370000	I mean, the thing about injection molding stuff is it may be somewhat cheap for the parts, but the initial cost is pretty expensive.
5370000	5375000	So, it may not even be, by the time I'm done, worth it doing, because to make the parts would be a few thousand dollars.
5375000	5381000	Which, you know, it's good if you're mass producing them, because then, you know, you cost average all that stuff out, and it gets pretty cheap.
5381000	5387000	But, if you're making, like, one pad or two pads, that might not work out too well.
5387000	5392000	You know, it'd be well over the cost of a DDR machine. What's the point at that point?
5392000	5400000	Alright, well, before we get into rapid-fire news, to take things a slightly different direction for a minute, I like some of this reminiscing people are doing in the chat room.
5400000	5410000	They're talking about this service, Imagination. I personally never heard of that one, but they're talking about some of the other old, like, old-school dial-up services and things that used to exist back in the day.
5410000	5414000	Qlink. I remember that one. Wasn't that actually called QuantumLink, and then I think they shortened it to Qlink?
5414000	5415000	I don't know.
5415000	5420000	I was on the Commodore 64, and I want to say that became America Online at some point, or AOL Bottom or something.
5420000	5421000	Maybe.
5421000	5426000	I remember that, and I always wanted to get on that with my 300 baud modem.
5426000	5431000	But, my parents, you know, I was only, like, probably eight at the time, didn't want me on that stuff.
5431000	5434000	But, Vandy brought up Genie and Prodigy.
5434000	5435000	I was on Prodigy.
5435000	5441000	I was on Prodigy, too, and I still remember my number to this day. I know I've talked about it on a previous show.
5441000	5444000	I got in a lot of trouble thanks to Prodigy chat rooms.
5444000	5453000	Oh, yeah. Well, I got in trouble just, I think, because one of the Prodigy numbers it dialed was a long-distance number, and we were on it for, like, a long time.
5453000	5454000	Oh, crap.
5454000	5458000	So, it, like, you know, it ranked up a pretty big phone bill.
5459000	5463000	But, yeah, the earliest modem I had was just a 2400 baud modem.
5463000	5467000	But, yeah, BBS's. That was some good times.
5467000	5470000	Oh, I spent so much time on BBS's back in the day.
5470000	5472000	It's crazy.
5472000	5476000	And BBS's wouldn't suddenly disconnect the stream, like, apparently just happened here.
5476000	5477000	What is up?
5477000	5480000	That's a Comcast issue, guys. It's not us. I'm sorry.
5481000	5483000	We should be back online now, though. It shows the streaming data.
5483000	5484000	But, where were we?
5484000	5485000	Oh, BBS's.
5486000	5488000	I used to call so many BBS's when I was, like, 12 to 15.
5488000	5492000	Where were we back? What did you used to have? Was it the California Computer News Magazine?
5492000	5493000	Yes.
5493000	5494000	Was it a free magazine?
5494000	5496000	You and I probably hung out on the same BBS's and didn't even know it.
5497000	5498000	Maybe.
5498000	5505000	Probably. I'll try to think. What were some of the big, my favorite BBS back in the day in the Sacramento area was one called the Open Mind.
5505000	5508000	I still remember it to this day. But it was huge on the forums.
5508000	5513000	And there were a lot, it had a very active forum community. I met a lot of great people on there.
5513000	5516000	And then there was one you could dial into to play Doom 2 online.
5517000	5520000	But that was the one where you had to buy credits after you used so much.
5522000	5526000	I can't remember some of the big ones that were here locally, but I used to play all that shit.
5526000	5533000	Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars 2002, The Pit with its graphical client. Amazing.
5533000	5539000	There was one BBS I used to dial into that actually would let you have internet access for, like, 15 minutes a day.
5539000	5547000	That was fantastic. And then also all the AOL discs. I mean, you would just be swimming in those things.
5547000	5549000	You'd go cancel. Hey, would you like another free month?
5549000	5551000	Yeah, sure. Free month.
5551000	5562000	I remember asking and begging my mom to let me call the long distance number to the Sierra BBS for, like, 20 minutes so I could download a game demo that I really wanted.
5562000	5568000	I don't even remember what it was now, but there was something on there that I really wanted because Sierra had an official BBS back in the day.
5568000	5572000	Good times. Dial back verification. All that good stuff.
5572000	5576000	I tried running a BBS, but my parents would never let me have the second line.
5576000	5584000	So it was one of those, you know, my really good friend Neil could call in when we set up a certain time.
5584000	5589000	And then my mom would pick up the phone to call one of her friends. Rob, what the hell are you doing?
5590000	5591000	Good times.
5593000	5596000	Alright, let's move on. Enough reminiscing. Let's talk rapid fire news.
5596000	5598000	Loki, start us off.
5598000	5603000	Alright, I'm very excited about this game coming out. It's been a long, long time coming.
5603000	5611000	Retro City Rampage, which originally started off as a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES and then just spun out from there.
5611000	5616000	And it has so many homages to, like, just all this 8-bit stuff.
5616000	5620000	You know, they've got everything you could possibly think of.
5620000	5630000	They have levels there based off of Metal Gear, levels based off of Breakthrough, levels based off of, you know, Bionic Commando, Mega Man, Blaster Master, all sorts of crazy stuff.
5630000	5634000	It's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
5634000	5638000	They're doing the cross-buy thing too with that, so that's where I'm purchasing it.
5638000	5644000	Although I do also want it on my Xbox 360 and maybe on Steam.
5644000	5647000	So I may actually purchase it on every single platform that comes out.
5647000	5652000	But it's $14.99, so that'll be coming out this week on the 9th.
5652000	5655000	I can't wait. That'll probably be the game I'm playing this week.
5655000	5661000	And it's very much like a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 type game top down, but it's just all sorts of crazy.
5661000	5666000	There's like Super Meat Boy stuff in there. There's a Super Meat Boy game that's done like the Virtual Boy in the game.
5666000	5668000	So it's going to be fantastic.
5668000	5680000	Also this week, well, one of the announcements, I guess, Namco Bandai is removing Nobby Nobby Boy from the iOS App Store, also on Tuesday.
5680000	5688000	And apparently they haven't really said why it's being removed. It is being removed by Namco Bandai, not Apple.
5688000	5693000	But apparently, you know, there's some functionality that hasn't been working for a few months.
5693000	5699000	So maybe they've just decided that, eh, we're going to get rid of it or something.
5699000	5707000	It's kind of sad. But if you want to play the game, I guess download it now so you have it.
5707000	5710000	And it is $1.99.
5710000	5717000	And then there's a new Kickstarter. I actually saw this one. The Kickstarter for Old School RPG.
5718000	5724000	It's being created by Brenda Brathwaite and Tom Hall.
5724000	5733000	Who, you know, you may not remember them, but of course they worked on some of the older game series like Wizardry and Dungeons & Dragons.
5733000	5739000	I was like, Brenda Brathwaite actually sounds very familiar. She was like an old school RPG person, right?
5739000	5743000	Yeah, and then Tom Hall was the founder of id Software. He made Commander Keen.
5744000	5753000	Holy shit, Commander Keen. That's one of those demos I downloaded for 30 minutes on my 24-14 board.
5753000	5760000	Man, one of the things I liked doing was we had a local video store that had a shareware table.
5760000	5766000	A table where you just buy floppy disks of all sorts of games. Good times, man.
5766000	5773000	It blows my fucking mind how I'm in junior high school, right? I guess it was more like freshman, sophomore year of high school.
5773000	5781000	I'm downloading the Wolfenstein 3D demo for 50 minutes. It takes me to download that demo on a 14 4K modem, right?
5781000	5788000	Flash forward to today, which, you know, I'm not that old all things considered, but this is maybe 20 years later.
5788000	5795000	I'm downloading Wolfenstein 3D to play on my phone over the air in less than a minute.
5797000	5799000	Think of where we're going to be 20 years from now.
5799000	5800000	Not even.
5800000	5801000	Raisy shit.
5801000	5802000	Like five years from now.
5802000	5804000	Crazy shit. Anyhow, sorry.
5804000	5814000	So yeah, so apparently if you pledge, you know, 15 bucks, you'll get a digital copy of the game.
5814000	5821000	And of course they've got all sorts of different things. They even have a $10,000 pledge point where they will show up to your door with a red velvet,
5821000	5828000	or deliver the game in a box on a red velvet pillow on a red carpet. So that's pretty funny.
5828000	5835000	And, you know, they also had one of their stretch goals is that they'll make two full games.
5835000	5838000	So neat.
5838000	5846000	Also DLC Quest, the game we kind of talked about a while, I actually played it on the indie games, but it's one of the games that's on the whole green light thing.
5846000	5853000	And one of their promises if they get green lit is that they're going to add some new content, which is good, because that game's only like one or two hours long.
5853000	5859000	And the new DLC is going to be called Live Free-mium or Die.
5859000	5867000	And they have, I guess, a new campaign world, or a new campaign, new world, new enemies, and buckets of new DLC to purchase.
5867000	5875000	And they're saying that that set the launch the fourth quarter of this year, which is pretty funny.
5875000	5881000	And yeah. And then that's it.
5881000	5888000	Alrighty. I got a few stories for you guys as well. First off, something about Star Wars Final Assault.
5888000	5895000	Hopefully this will be one of the Star Wars games that isn't terrible. Because they're hit and miss. Sometimes they're really good, sometimes they're really not good.
5895000	5904000	But Star Wars Final Assault will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade. There is an image out there floating around of the actual artwork that will be used on the arcade.
5904000	5911000	That's kind of how they spilled it there. So the game was first announced way back in August when there were trademark and domain registrations.
5911000	5917000	But this game, it's funny to note, still has not been officially announced. So we don't even really know exactly what it is.
5917000	5927000	Yeah, they haven't announced it. It came out of a leak. There was a leak of all the fourth quarter titles that were coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
5927000	5931000	And there's actually some other ones I saw that were interesting, but I don't remember what it was.
5931000	5940000	Well, could one of them be this game I'm going to mention next? Karate Kia? I could never say this. It's basically Karate. Karate Ka. I guess that's the way you would say it. Karate Ka.
5940000	5947000	I remember this old, old game. This was back in the Commodore 64 days and all that. And it was in the arcades too.
5947000	5955000	There's a remake now coming out. Obviously it's now 3D, a little more inspired by the Street Fighter IVs of the world and so forth.
5955000	5959000	But still kind of cool that it's on Xbox Live Arcade. It's small enough to be there.
5959000	5969000	Xbox.com actually had this posted. It wasn't supposed to be an official announcement, but people that were scouring Xbox.com actually found it.
5969000	5981000	This one is supposed to be out I believe relatively soon. November-ish is when that remake is coming out. November 16th? 14th? 14th that link is to be believed that was found on Xbox.com.
5982000	5993000	This fad isn't going to die anytime soon. It's the Gangnam Style dance. Ah yes. It's now available to your character in Free Realms.
5993000	6003000	You might remember Free Realms as the free-to-play MMO that's available on the Playstation 3. It sucks. But hey, you can do this dance in the game.
6004000	6014000	Here's what I love about the trailer. They can't use the actual music. Oh son of a bitch. I don't care about the E.T. re-release. Show me the frickin' movie I really want to see.
6014000	6021000	And they don't have walkie-talkies anymore. That's important. Even on the Blu-ray version? I thought they went back to it. No they got rid of it I think.
6021000	6029000	I thought Spielberg said he regretted that. Do we need to have a conversation about E.T.? No. Alright here we go. Here's the actual trailer. They have to use fake music.
6033000	6047000	Even though it's the actual dance. Here's the problem with this. Not only is Free Realms kind of crap, but let's be real. The moment that sold that video for most people was when he was dancing over the guy in the elevator.
6047000	6052000	That was the best part of the entire video and I don't see that represented here in Free Realms.
6053000	6063000	And everybody's saying why aren't the panda bears doing this in Mists of Pandaria? Well cause they programmed that dance in like nine months ago way before Gangnam Style was a thing.
6063000	6075000	And there you have it. Apparently a Wii U demo interface has been shown. This is because the Wii U demo kiosk is now available in the official store in New York City.
6075000	6081000	So I don't know if some of our New York City fans are nearby and want to check that out, but you can check that out. It's a Wii U demo station.
6081000	6090000	And it has some of the cover art for some of the various games there. You can select whatever demo cover art you want to play and you get a video or you get to actually play the demo depending on what it is.
6090000	6099000	Apparently only Rayman Legends is actually usable, but who knows. I mean this is still really early on. The console is still a good month and a half away.
6099000	6106000	So I imagine they'll add more to this. But that's available at the official Nintendo store. So those of you that are in New York might want to check that out.
6106000	6112000	Alright, let's move on to the foogle question of the week.
6112000	6128000	Rama the ever great reporter for VOG says he'll go by there tomorrow. Check it out. Get on it Rama.
6129000	6136000	Alright, foogle question of the week. Very simple this week. I thought I'd tie it into what we talked about at the beginning of the show.
6136000	6144000	What's the scariest video game you've ever played and why? Easy enough right? We talked about this at the beginning of the show.
6144000	6149000	Let's go to Facebook. I always start on Google Plus. We'll go to Facebook this week and start off here.
6149000	6158000	Ronnie B says condemned criminal origins. Based on the demo it had I fully went in expecting something like a CSI sim and that's what I wanted. Nothing more.
6158000	6165000	The demo focused a lot on using forensic tools and being a cop so I thought great. The longer you play the crazier it got though.
6165000	6172000	James S. replied there's another game on PC that I haven't played but would love to like Amnesia or Slenderman.
6172000	6178000	My computer is ancient so I have to go with a console game. I know it sounds cliche but Silent Hill 2 and 3 collection.
6178000	6185000	Was phenomenal. I can't remember how many times I had to turn it off when playing alone at night because I was literally dreading turning around that next darkened corner.
6185000	6193000	Freaky music in the background and none of the stupid team co-op stuff to ruin it. These games are more scary when we are completely and utterly alone.
6193000	6200000	With that being said there aren't really many AAA horror titles that are genuinely scary. Maybe they just don't make enough money. What a shame.
6201000	6211000	Acidic Vampire says Dead Space 1 and 2. Disfigured creatures a la John Carpenter's The Thing aboard a derelict spacecraft. Need I say more?
6211000	6224000	Shattered Hawk says as a kid I used to own Shadow Man for the N64. The music mixed with monsters gave me nightmares. The pig guys with the hooks that screamed when they spotted you still gives me the chills.
6224000	6234000	I never played that game but that sounds scary. Tim N says Silent Hill 2. It is peerless as far as horror goes. The rest are pretenders.
6234000	6242000	Some strong words there. Gamer Girl says I know you only asked for one but I have two. Eternal Darkness was really scary for me.
6242000	6250000	I don't know but when you get to the part where your heart starts racing in game it was over for me in real life. Why? Because I'm a huge music lover. I feel whatever I'm listening to.
6250000	6264000	Same goes for F.E.A.R. Those are two of the most scariest games for me. But somehow I still love it. Dan Shadow says the original F.E.A.R. was really creepy. The first few missions had great jump scares and you didn't.
6264000	6274000	He spoils part 2. You'll have to read that on Facebook to see that. Mike B says Jaws Unleashed. It was scary bad. I knew somebody would go with the Showgirls route.
6274000	6284000	I thought Jaws wasn't that bad. I don't know if it was Unleashed though. Wasn't that the remake one where you can play as the shark OMG. The shark one looked fun.
6284000	6299000	Dave Falcon said return to Castle Wolfenstein. There was a small part in the game that just startled the crap out of me during gameplay. I was walking through a snowy field and everything was quiet and calm and the Nazis jumped out of nowhere and made me jump out of my skin. Shot the crap out of me. Nazis always scare me.
6299000	6313000	Another vote for Silent Hill 2 from Clover N. Chiggers says Bioshock had a moment that scared the shit out of me. One of those zombie dudes jumped out from behind a coffin and made me drop the controller. Fucking zombies. Bioshock was really scary.
6313000	6331000	DDR Dollar Bill says Haunted house on the 2600. When you could not see the walls at all, no weapons and could not even see behind the doors. Drop my damn controller every time I opened one and a damn spider or bat or ghost killed me. Quite honestly I'd like to see a follow up of scariest moments.
6331000	6337000	Haunted house on the 2600 was kind of old school survival horror. I think they remade that for the 360. Yeah and it's shit. Yeah.
6337000	6352000	And DJ Rama S replied and said Bioshock. And a very similar story to what Chiggers had mentioned before with somebody popping out there. He said well played 2k games well played. Let's go to Google Plus and look at some of the answers there.
6352000	6367000	Marcus E says Haunting ground. Even though the Capcom game focuses on a busty gal running around like some horror flick, it managed to be much deeper. Any game where your only option is to run seems scary by default.
6367000	6378000	But the atmosphere in Haunting Ground was fantastic. Pair that with supremely creepy stalkers, foreboding locations and a terrifying soundtrack and the game was one of the best horror titles.
6378000	6394000	I must give you one example of how the game managed to be so scary. Haunting Ground focuses on hiding since you can rarely fight back. At one point I was running from an antagonist, rushed down a hallway into a room and went to hide in the closet.
6394000	6400000	Guess what? She was in the closet waiting for me. Moments like that just made the game near perfect.
6400000	6419000	Act Def says Aside from Silent Hill, Eversion. That game is really fucked up and so much too. Lastly, Redertainment says Silent Hill 3. I had to stop playing that game near the end so the fear that was building up on my body could leave me. I occasionally still hear the sounds of those damn demon dogs.
6420000	6432000	So there it is. The answers from Facebook and Google Plus. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or you can look us up on Google Plus if you want to answer in a future week.
6432000	6445000	Some things I was surprised not to hear. Did you notice some of the games that were left out? I heard one person mention Amnesia but didn't pick that as their most scary. No Resident Evils. I didn't hear Clock Tower which I always thought was kind of a fucked up.
6446000	6457000	I don't know. I kind of thought it was scary. Fatal Frame. Kind of a lot of stuff that wasn't there but still some good picks. I'm not saying you guys didn't pick good stuff but lots of love for Silent Hill apparently.
6457000	6468000	There you go. Alright, there it is. Your FUGL Question of the Week. Let's get back into some more news. We're not too far away from the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR. Not just yet though. Some more news stories first.
6468000	6480000	So Sony likes doing a lot of different bundles, especially around the holidays. And one of the things that they said they, eh, we're not not going to do it but it might be a cool idea.
6481000	6498000	Apparently they're thinking that hey maybe someday we'll do a bundle that includes a Vita and a Playstation 3. And I think that could be possible if they have some more of those games that are going to be kind of working like the Wii U or the Xbox Smart Glass stuff.
6498000	6510000	So maybe if that becomes popular they might do this. It'd have to get a hell of a lot cheaper though because it's going to be a hard sell to have a portable system and a regular system in there.
6510000	6519000	Yeah, that bundle is going to have to be a heck of a deal but it's going to look like, you know, twice as much as the Wii U.
6519000	6532000	Yeah. I don't know. It'd be neat. Right now they don't have a whole lot of interconnectivity between the two systems. Some games, you know, kind of use it but not a whole ton.
6532000	6533000	But they could.
6533000	6548000	They could. They could do anything. They could bundle it with a TV. I'm sure they've done that. So, I don't know. It's not outside the realm of possibility but is it going to be something that people are going to be looking for? Probably not.
6548000	6551000	Options. I remember people like options.
6551000	6560000	Well some options people would like to see on the Wii U is more variety in games and some more things that address the hardcore.
6560000	6566000	And of course follow ups to some of those big Operation Rainfall games, The Last Story and Xenoblade.
6566000	6577000	Well, Reggie Fils-Aime made a comment, I believe this was to, I think it was to Kotaku actually, about Xenoblade and The Last Story and all that.
6577000	6583000	The comment was about what is Monolith Soft doing now? What is the Wii U game that they're making?
6583000	6592000	And the quote is this, quote, we know that they're working on a game. I personally haven't seen it but I know there's a lot of excitement in Japan and Kyoto about what they're working on.
6592000	6601000	So I look forward to seeing it. In the end, if it's a game that we decide to publish from what would be a second party standpoint, certainly we'd love to bring it here to the US.
6601000	6609000	The way we look at the opportunity is, given a level of marketing support, how much are we going to sell and is it going to be a profitable venture?
6609000	6616000	So a whole lot of nothing kind of about, you know, maybe we'll release it, maybe we won't.
6616000	6622000	I found some of the comments on this particular website a little more interesting than the article itself.
6622000	6625000	MyNintendoNews.com is where some of these comments come from.
6625000	6629000	And some people are kind of talking about, like they're fighting about, did Xenoblade do well or not?
6629000	6633000	One commenter says, I bet the Wii U game will do well since Xenoblade did well.
6633000	6638000	And somebody replies to that, it did well, it barely sold 300,000 copies in North America.
6638000	6640000	I put it this way, and I just saw this this week.
6640000	6641000	Yeah?
6641000	6643000	The last story, it's out of print. They're not making it anymore.
6643000	6644000	Oh shit.
6644000	6649000	But that was something that was being put out by Exceed, so it's kind of their MO.
6649000	6656000	Atlas does the same thing, you know, they kind of make a small initial lot and then they sell through it and put it out of print.
6656000	6661000	But, I mean, I don't think they sold that well.
6661000	6663000	Well, somebody replies though, and this is a good point.
6663000	6668000	Okay, 300,000 doesn't seem that bad when you consider it was only available at two places.
6668000	6670000	Nintendo's website or GameStop.
6670000	6675000	No Amazon, no Walmart, no Best Buy, none of that.
6675000	6679000	But it doesn't matter though, for the people that wanted that game, they could get it there.
6679000	6683000	And let's be honest, GameStop is the largest game retailer out there, so...
6683000	6687000	300,000 doesn't seem that bad to me though, when you put it in that context.
6687000	6694000	It's not that bad. It's not. I mean, there's been multi-platform games that sold under that hell.
6694000	6699000	Earth Defense Force, you know, Insect Armageddon sold under 300,000 copies per platform.
6699000	6700000	There you go.
6700000	6703000	So, I mean, it makes sense.
6703000	6705000	But the other bottom line of that is that...
6709000	6710000	Sorry, I lost my train of thought.
6710000	6712000	The other bottom line of that is that...
6714000	6715000	Damn it, where was I going with this?
6716000	6717000	This is where live radio bugs...
6717000	6719000	That they're going to actually bring it over?
6719000	6721000	Yeah, or I guess that maybe the decision hasn't been made yet.
6721000	6722000	And if it's going to take...
6722000	6726000	Yeah, that's where I was going with this, is that even if they decide they're going to do it,
6726000	6727000	you're not going to see it anytime soon.
6728000	6729000	Yeah.
6730000	6733000	Bobby Blackwolf wants to correct something you said.
6733000	6736000	He says Walmart is the largest game retailer, and I believe it.
6736000	6742000	GameStop may be the largest specialty retailer, but Walmart is the largest retailer of a lot of things.
6742000	6746000	Well, they're the largest retailer of, you know, retailer out there.
6746000	6751000	But as far as game specialty as, you know, category, GameStop is far beyond Walmart.
6751000	6756000	Walmart may sell through a lot of stuff, but the biggest chunk is going to GameStop.
6756000	6760000	That's why you see a lot of special stuff being done for GameStop, like a lot of exclusives.
6760000	6763000	You don't see Walmart exclusives for that stuff. On movies, though, you do.
6763000	6766000	You do. You do see some Walmart exclusive things. Rarely, but you do.
6766000	6772000	And I would argue that you probably do see more actual games at the end of the day sold at Walmart than you do at GameStop.
6772000	6774000	Same thing with the CDs.
6774000	6777000	You wouldn't think Walmart's the largest CD retailer in the world, but they are.
6777000	6782000	Maybe with iTunes in the picture, it's a little different now, but the largest physical CD retailer in the world.
6783000	6786000	They're the largest retailer of a lot of stuff, like it or not.
6787000	6788000	So...
6789000	6791000	Anyhow, that's all I wanted to say about that.
6791000	6793000	Let's move on, Loki.
6793000	6794000	Alright.
6795000	6797000	So, let's see.
6797000	6799000	This is kind of neat.
6799000	6804000	AbleGamers, you know, they're dedicated to gamers with different disabilities and stuff.
6804000	6811000	They're actually going to open up an arcade, an accessibility arcade.
6811000	6817000	And I guess the concept that was originally, I guess, going to be a...
6817000	6824000	It was originally a limited time installation, but they're saying this is going to be a permanent addition to the Washington, D.C. Public Library.
6824000	6827000	I guess the Martin Luther King branch.
6827000	6835000	And it's going to allow different gamers with all sorts of different disabilities to be able to enjoy games.
6835000	6842000	So you're going to see games with, you know, maybe some audio-only games.
6842000	6844000	You know, that kind of stuff in there.
6844000	6853000	And they haven't really said what specific types of games are going to be in there, but I can kind of imagine the stuff that they have.
6853000	6858000	And I guess this is opening very soon.
6858000	6862000	Or, actually, by the looks of it, it's already open.
6862000	6863000	Oh, wow.
6863000	6865000	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
6865000	6866000	That's pretty cool.
6866000	6867000	Now, this is in Washington, D.C.
6867000	6870000	No, I'm sorry. It opens this Wednesday.
6871000	6873000	By the time a lot of people hear this, it'll be open.
6873000	6875000	Or book their flights to Washington, D.C.
6875000	6877000	Where this is at, apparently, right?
6877000	6878000	Yeah.
6878000	6880000	Well, that's pretty neat.
6880000	6883000	Especially when you hear every day how arcades are dying.
6883000	6889000	And just last week, we had a story on the show about another major arcade that was shutting down.
6889000	6894000	It's nice to hear that not only is something opening up, even though this is...
6894000	6898000	I mean, it's a library and all that stuff, so it isn't like an arcade in the traditional sense.
6898000	6904000	It's neat that not only is something opening up, but it's opening up with a broader idea in mind.
6904000	6906000	And something new.
6906000	6907000	Yeah.
6907000	6912000	Which, you know, now we look at it and go, oh, this is something we should have had all along, but this is a great idea.
6912000	6914000	Well, let's hope it does well for them.
6914000	6916000	Maybe it'll start a trend.
6916000	6923000	But sadly, I think with how arcades have been doing recently, I think the trend has already been had.
6923000	6929000	Anyhow, there were a few Nintendo Direct conferences this week that talk about the 3DS.
6929000	6933000	And we get to find out what's in store for the 3DS this year.
6933000	6939000	I guess there's a sequel being made to Pushmo, Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania the Adventure,
6939000	6942000	and some other games developed by Level 5 and so forth.
6942000	6945000	There's some good stuff that's actually, like, original.
6945000	6947000	Night Sky is coming out October 25th.
6948000	6956000	That is an action-puzzle game that will be an ambient gameplay experience with cerebral challenges that will be uniquely designed picturesque worlds.
6956000	6960000	By the way, these are all e-shot titles. I probably should have put that out there, too.
6960000	6965000	Crashmo is the sequel to Pushmo on November 22nd.
6965000	6969000	Fluidity Spin Cycle is on December 27th.
6969000	6971000	This is going to make use of the tilt.
6971000	6974000	Like, not a lot of games have been using the gyroscope in there.
6974000	6982000	This will have, like, tilt and turn and all that stuff to maneuver a puddle of water named Eddie through a maze-like world.
6982000	6987000	But it's the whole, like, you can do liquid to ice or steam, solid liquid gas type of thing.
6987000	6991000	Wow, that sounds just like that one game that Konami put out. Remember?
6991000	6992000	Yeah, I remember that. I remember that.
6992000	6993000	Dewey's Adventure?
6993000	6994000	Yeah, yeah.
6994000	6997000	Nintendo e-shops will get Level 5 stuff.
6997000	7000000	Suda51's Liberation Maiden.
7000000	7008000	A hundred years in the future when the president of Japan boards her liberator Kamui and fights to free her country one region at a time.
7008000	7014000	Arrow Porter and Crimson Shroud are also on the table to be released by the end of the year.
7014000	7023000	And Pedestrian Tossing Pandemonium in Tokyo Crash Mobs, an action-puzzle game in early 2013.
7023000	7024000	There you go.
7024000	7028000	There are also some 3DS titles that are full games that are now available for download.
7028000	7038000	Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64 3D, Mario Kart 7, all coming on October 18th for $39.99 each.
7038000	7043000	Most of those you can start to find in the bargain bins for far cheaper, so be careful. I'm just saying.
7043000	7047000	Well, it's nice that Nintendo offers such bargains on that stuff.
7047000	7048000	Right.
7048000	7066000	Virtual Console. Mario Golf on October 11th, Castlevania The Adventure on October 25th, Ninja Gaiden on November 8th, Zelda 2 The Adventure of Link on November 22nd, Wario Land 2 on December 20th, and Mario Bros. The Lost Levels on December 27th.
7066000	7073000	Also in Nintendo news, Animal Crossing 3DS updates.
7073000	7074000	Cool.
7074000	7079000	Some characters might set up a tent and camp outside.
7079000	7083000	You can help your in-game friends with purchasing decisions.
7083000	7087000	Use your office as the mayor to make decisions on putting things in town.
7087000	7093000	You pick a location for construction to begin on the items you plan on adding.
7093000	7096000	A megaphone lets you gather people.
7096000	7099000	I've got something to say.
7099000	7103000	There's now a shoe store, a museum store.
7103000	7106000	Dr. Shrunk will be back at the club.
7106000	7109000	There are now many more emotions.
7109000	7115000	You can view the homes of people you street pass and trade items with people you street pass.
7115000	7118000	You can take a picture with a photo booth.
7118000	7124000	There's now a massage parlor that will relax you and put you into a dream stage.
7124000	7127000	Maybe this is leading into Animal Crossing Happy Endings.
7127000	7129000	It'll be the next game. Who knows?
7129000	7132000	You can explore the town of someone else.
7132000	7135000	I thought you could do that in the last one on the Wii.
7135000	7138000	Maybe you can do that with a Haddon invitation or something?
7138000	7139000	Maybe.
7139000	7144000	KK Slider will also be the DJ at the club as well as playing the guitar.
7144000	7146000	More KK songs.
7146000	7149000	You can explore a town with other people.
7149000	7151000	You can take the boat to the island.
7151000	7153000	Grab items from the bottom of the sea.
7153000	7158000	There's mini games in various stores when you visit the island by boat.
7158000	7164000	Tortimer is the host of mini games and wears a tropical shirt so it sounds like the former mayor has retired to the island.
7164000	7165000	And not dead.
7165000	7167000	And not dead.
7167000	7172000	And one mini game has you navigating a maze to collect a certain item.
7172000	7174000	What a profound new concept.
7174000	7177000	Maze navigation. I've never heard of that in a video game.
7178000	7187000	Frisbee in chat asks, can you still hit animals over the head with the bug catching net?
7187000	7190000	I hope so or this whole fucking game is invalidated, isn't it?
7190000	7196000	Can you drag animals into an abandoned house and set up a Saw-style trap system for them?
7196000	7199000	No, I'm sorry. I'm not buying this game.
7199000	7204000	I really wish the developers would just go balls to the wall and put out Animal Crossing after dark.
7204000	7206000	We need Volition to come out with Animal Crossing.
7207000	7211000	Let's see some crazy dildo shit.
7211000	7217000	We need a good old up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start that unlocks a brothel in your village.
7219000	7220000	So wrong.
7222000	7223000	So right.
7223000	7224000	So right.
7224000	7228000	I think that's worthy enough of being a dream game to be honest, Animal Crossing after dark.
7228000	7231000	But I'm pretty sure we've talked about something like that before.
7231000	7233000	Ask Animal Crossing the line.
7234000	7236000	All right. Loki, what do you got next?
7236000	7240000	All right. So next thing I've got, this is pretty cool.
7242000	7243000	So what would you say?
7243000	7246000	And I completely forgot about this until I saw the article.
7246000	7249000	You remember No Doubt and Activision?
7249000	7250000	There was a little lawsuit there.
7250000	7251000	Oh yeah, I remember this.
7251000	7256000	They were suing because, you know, people were singing other songs that they shouldn't have been singing.
7256000	7258000	You know, didn't like it.
7258000	7259000	Of course.
7259000	7260000	Shock.
7260000	7261000	Settled out of court.
7261000	7262000	Settled out of court.
7262000	7264000	Oh my god, you don't say.
7264000	7266000	Another lawsuit in the gaming industry settled out of court.
7266000	7268000	Get out now.
7268000	7269000	I know.
7269000	7271000	They've settled.
7271000	7272000	That's it.
7273000	7274000	No word on the settlement.
7274000	7277000	As usual, no word on who got what.
7277000	7278000	Yeah.
7280000	7282000	All right, let's go to the mailbag.
7282000	7285000	Every week you guys send us emails.
7285000	7288000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7288000	7292000	We dive into the mailbag and pick out a few emails that we think we should read on air.
7292000	7294000	So let's open up the mailbag.
7296000	7297000	Hello?
7297000	7298000	Hello?
7298000	7299000	Mailbag?
7299000	7300000	Where's the emails?
7300000	7301000	I don't think she's here.
7301000	7302000	Hello?
7303000	7307000	Oh, there's no emails in the mailbag this week.
7307000	7311000	So even if DarkSakura was here, there'd be nothing to read.
7311000	7313000	Womp womp.
7313000	7316000	I guess you guys just don't have any questions or things you want to talk about.
7316000	7318000	You just don't like us anymore.
7318000	7319000	Let's see how it is.
7319000	7321000	You're too busy playing your games.
7321000	7323000	You're all addicted to Pandaria.
7323000	7324000	Let's see how it goes.
7324000	7326000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7326000	7329000	Leave DarkSakura a surprise for when she gets back.
7329000	7331000	A mountain of emails. She'll appreciate it.
7331000	7333000	She likes mountains of emails.
7333000	7335000	That's right. She loves mountains of emails.
7335000	7336000	More than anything.
7336000	7341000	All right, well, what a good opportunity for us to get into the FUs of the week.
7347000	7349000	All this is bad.
7349000	7351000	Here is justice.
7351000	7353000	Here is punishment.
7353000	7355000	Here is...
7355000	7357000	This is fucked up.
7357000	7359000	Loki, why don't you start?
7359000	7361000	I don't really have an FU of the week.
7361000	7365000	I guess an FU to not be able to play Borderlands 2.
7365000	7367000	I want to play that this week.
7368000	7371000	My FU of the week goes to the listeners for not sending us any email.
7371000	7374000	Unless you voted for us in one of the podcast award things.
7374000	7376000	Then you're forgiven if you did that, I suppose.
7376000	7378000	FU to that.
7378000	7380000	That's a not-so-serious FU.
7380000	7387000	Otherwise, I would say an FU to just all the money I've spent on this Rocky project.
7387000	7389000	It's pretty disgusting.
7389000	7391000	But you know what?
7391000	7395000	It's a community I really love and I'm excited to see it back in town.
7395000	7401000	Just FU to nerves and the realization that, oh my god, this is happening in five days.
7402000	7404000	I'm just freaking out a little bit.
7404000	7406000	But it'll be good.
7406000	7408000	It'll be good.
7408000	7410000	It'll be good.
7410000	7412000	Alright, let's get to a couple more news stories.
7412000	7415000	Then we'll take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7415000	7417000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
7417000	7418000	Loki.
7418000	7420000	Alright, so we talked about it last week.
7420000	7425000	How there was the oh-so-wonderful promotion that Microsoft is doing tied with your gamerscore.
7425000	7428000	Where you got a 1% or 2% kickback.
7428000	7429000	Woohoo!
7429000	7430000	1% kickback!
7430000	7432000	That's fantastic.
7432000	7438000	Well, Sony side-upped the deal a little bit because they think 1% is not necessarily good enough.
7438000	7440000	So here's what they're going to do.
7440000	7445000	They announced that apparently if you buy $100 or more in October,
7445000	7450000	you're going to get a $20 voucher for the PlayStation Network in November.
7452000	7453000	Not bad.
7453000	7455000	That's enough to buy Tokyo Jungle.
7455000	7457000	And a lot of games online, actually.
7457000	7458000	That's 20%.
7458000	7461000	That's 10 times better than 2%.
7461000	7464000	Does the money I spend on PlayStation Plus count towards that?
7468000	7469000	No.
7469000	7473000	Well, they said just on PlayStation Network, so maybe?
7473000	7475000	Maybe that would count?
7475000	7478000	But, you know, you can buy...
7478000	7481000	I mean, I think it's kind of the push you a little bit to...
7481000	7482000	And this is kind of cool.
7482000	7485000	If you're thinking on the fence about the digital stuff,
7485000	7486000	remember you can buy those digital games.
7486000	7490000	If you have PlayStation Plus, you get 10% off of the digital games.
7490000	7491000	Plus, you get $20 back.
7491000	7493000	So that could really cut down the cost of these new release games
7493000	7496000	if you're interested in picking up about $100 with the product.
7496000	7500000	So actdeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
7500000	7504000	I got 20 Microsoft points for my birthday from Microsoft.
7504000	7507000	A whole 20 points?
7507000	7509000	That is a whole quarter.
7509000	7510000	That's your birthday.
7510000	7511000	There's the quarter.
7511000	7513000	That's what the special birthday thing was.
7513000	7515000	20 Microsoft points.
7515000	7516000	20 Microsoft points.
7516000	7517000	You know what that will buy?
7517000	7518000	Nothing.
7518000	7520000	Not a goddamn thing.
7520000	7523000	All that will do is that will bug you.
7523000	7527000	It would be like someone went into your house in the middle of the night
7527000	7530000	and plucked out one of those pixels in your TV.
7530000	7532000	And, like, made it not work.
7532000	7534000	And it's just going to fucking bother you
7534000	7536000	because you're going to have, like, 20 points left over.
7536000	7538000	You're like, fuck, I can't buy anything with these 20 points.
7538000	7540000	I need to purchase more points to buy stuff.
7540000	7543000	And it's just going to drive you crazy until you buy it.
7543000	7547000	And then still end up with 120 points left over.
7547000	7551000	Some other freaking multiple of something you'll never be able to spend.
7551000	7553000	You could buy, according to Dartetsuya,
7553000	7556000	you could buy one quarter of Bungie Ferret Tossing,
7556000	7559000	which is a one dollar game and a great deal
7559000	7563000	on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace right now.
7563000	7564000	Ooh.
7564000	7566000	Oh, Microsoft, you're so generous.
7566000	7568000	So 20 bucks does sound a lot better than...
7568000	7569000	You could even give me a buck.
7569000	7570000	Give me a dollar.
7570000	7572000	It's fake money.
7573000	7576000	Now, 100 bucks on the PlayStation Marketplace.
7576000	7578000	That seems like a lot of money to spend, but...
7578000	7580000	If you're buying new release games.
7580000	7582000	Exactly. All it takes is two new release games, right?
7582000	7584000	Or even one new release game
7584000	7586000	and maybe, like, three PlayStation Network games
7586000	7588000	to get you there.
7588000	7592000	I wonder if PlayStation Plus dollars count towards that.
7592000	7593000	Probably not.
7593000	7597000	If you have PlayStation Plus or if you buy PlayStation Plus.
7597000	7598000	If you buy PlayStation Plus.
7598000	7599000	Maybe.
7599000	7601000	Like, maybe this is my month to renew.
7602000	7603000	I don't know.
7603000	7604000	Maybe.
7605000	7606000	I'd be interested to know that.
7608000	7610000	To register participation for this week's episode
7610000	7613000	of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
7613000	7615000	use the passphrase, quarter.
7615000	7617000	All right, one more story for you guys tonight
7617000	7619000	and then we're going to open up the Skype line
7619000	7621000	for calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR
7621000	7623000	or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7623000	7625000	This doesn't have to do with gaming per se,
7625000	7626000	but I think this is a good story
7626000	7629000	because obviously gaming owes a lot of thanks to this
7629000	7632000	and that is the anniversary that we celebrate this week.
7632000	7635000	The compact disc turns 30
7635000	7639000	or the CD is now 30 years old.
7639000	7642000	Yes, Loki, you and I are older than the CD.
7642000	7644000	I'm surprised it's been around that long.
7644000	7646000	I'm also surprised it's been around that long
7646000	7648000	because it didn't really start to take off
7648000	7650000	until about 90, like, the early 90s,
7650000	7651000	maybe the late 80s.
7651000	7653000	It's like when rich people had them.
7653000	7658000	But, yeah, the early 80s is when the CD actually started.
7658000	7661000	The CD was a joint effort of Philips and Sony.
7661000	7663000	They were working independently on different versions
7663000	7665000	of the technology in the 70s
7665000	7670000	and they started to come out right in June of 1985
7670000	7672000	was when the CD-ROM was really born
7672000	7675000	and that, of course, led to where we're at now.
7675000	7677000	And, of course, without the CD,
7677000	7680000	we would never have had the PlayStation era
7680000	7684000	or really arguably DVDs and Blu-ray and all the stuff we have now.
7684000	7688000	I mean, DVDs and Blu-rays still are shaped like a CD.
7688000	7690000	There you go.
7690000	7692000	And, of course, it was a great sound.
7692000	7694000	I remember the whole big thing about it was, like,
7694000	7696000	you can skip right to tracks.
7696000	7698000	Like, no more rewinding and fast-forwarding.
7698000	7701000	I think you could skip to tracks on eight tracks,
7701000	7703000	but you still had to rewind them at some point.
7703000	7706000	Because I just remember the giant buttons
7706000	7708000	that were one, two, three, and four.
7708000	7710000	Oh, boy.
7710000	7712000	Oh, this leads to a great question chat.
7712000	7714000	I love where Tigerclaw is going for this.
7714000	7716000	Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line
7716000	7717000	and we'll tackle this question.
7717000	7718000	1877 Game OLR.
7718000	7720000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7720000	7722000	While we wait for some calls,
7722000	7723000	Tigerclaw in chat says,
7723000	7728000	Do you guys remember the first CD you ever bought and still have?
7728000	7729000	Tigerclaw says,
7729000	7733000	My very first CD was the too unlimited album called No Limit.
7733000	7737000	That was a big DDR band.
7737000	7738000	I remember that.
7738000	7740000	Loki, do you remember the first CD you ever owned?
7740000	7741000	God, I don't even know.
7741000	7742000	I don't know.
7742000	7745000	It was probably one of the mystery of sound CDs.
7745000	7747000	I used to buy a bunch of those things.
7747000	7749000	I used to go crazy over at Virgin Records
7749000	7750000	and buy all the imports.
7750000	7751000	Oh, the Virgin Megastore?
7751000	7752000	Yeah, Virgin Megastore.
7752000	7753000	The bomb.
7753000	7755000	Because I used to buy a bunch of import stuff.
7755000	7757000	I used to be really into buying a lot of that stuff.
7757000	7760000	I don't remember what my first CD was.
7760000	7763000	I sort of remember my first CD player.
7763000	7766000	I had a tape adapter for my car.
7766000	7770000	But yeah, I don't even remember what my first CD was.
7771000	7774000	Well, okay, I don't really have a first CD
7774000	7777000	because I bought two CDs when I first went.
7777000	7780000	And one of them was the soundtrack to The Addams Family,
7780000	7782000	which came out that year.
7782000	7783000	And I love that movie.
7783000	7786000	So I bought that even though it was mostly orchestral.
7786000	7787000	I remember having that.
7787000	7789000	But then, here you go.
7789000	7790000	You ready for this?
7790000	7791000	It was another soundtrack.
7791000	7794000	And here's one of my big gay moments.
7794000	7795000	You ready?
7795000	7799000	One of my first CDs was the soundtrack to Sister Act.
7799000	7802000	That's right, the Whoopi Goldberg classic.
7804000	7807000	Was one of the first CDs I ever owned.
7807000	7811000	I don't still have them though, which is kind of tragic
7811000	7814000	because I got rid of all my CDs during one of my moves.
7814000	7816000	So, kind of sad.
7816000	7820000	Let's see, I'm going to the chat to check out some of these answers.
7820000	7821000	DJ Dark Knight says,
7821000	7824000	My first ever CD was Dr. Dre the Chronic.
7824000	7826000	See, there's nothing to be embarrassed about there.
7826000	7827000	That's like a classic album.
7827000	7829000	Actually, no. I remember what my first CDs were
7829000	7831000	because they weren't actually my CDs.
7831000	7834000	My parents, they bought a new stereo system that had a CD player.
7834000	7839000	So we had, one of the first CDs we had was
7841000	7843000	Michael Jackson, Black and White.
7843000	7844000	Oh, yeah.
7844000	7846000	That was like a landmark song when that came out.
7846000	7847000	Again, our Skype line is open.
7847000	7849000	1-877-GAMO-L-R.
7849000	7850000	That album wasn't Black and White.
7850000	7851000	That was, what was it called?
7851000	7852000	Dangerous.
7852000	7853000	Dangerous, yes. Dangerous.
7853000	7854000	That was it.
7854000	7855000	1-877-GAMO-L-R.
7855000	7856000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7856000	7858000	Let's get to some embarrassing answers.
7858000	7859000	Rama in chat says,
7859000	7862000	My first CD was the Aqua Barbie Girl single.
7864000	7865000	Love it.
7865000	7866000	Let's see.
7866000	7868000	Ziba says,
7868000	7871000	I think mine was either Ace of Base or No Doubt.
7871000	7875000	Some answers that you can't really be embarrassed about.
7875000	7876000	Act F says,
7876000	7878000	My first CD was an Aerosmith album.
7878000	7879000	Orange Wright says,
7879000	7881000	Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise.
7881000	7884000	Alan Alchemy remembers buying CDs for other people
7884000	7886000	were the first CDs he bought.
7886000	7887000	The Wayne's World soundtrack.
7887000	7889000	Primus was Sailing the Seas of Cheese.
7889000	7892000	Weezer's Debut and Madonna's Erotica.
7894000	7895000	Let's see.
7895000	7896000	Zethur says,
7896000	7899000	My first CD was Weird Al's The Food Album.
7900000	7901000	Awesome.
7903000	7906000	Well, let me, I need to load up the Twitter.
7906000	7907000	I forgot to get out my iPad,
7907000	7909000	so I guess I'll have to do this the regular way.
7909000	7912000	See if there's any tweets tonight at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
7912000	7914000	I know Tiger Claw usually sends us a couple.
7914000	7915000	I'll see if there's anything else in there.
7915000	7917000	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
7917000	7919000	Uh, no, I don't.
7919000	7920000	Yikes.
7920000	7922000	At least nothing I've seen so far.
7929000	7932000	Alright, well, I got some tweets while you find it.
7932000	7933000	Let's see.
7933000	7935000	From Code Man asks,
7935000	7937000	Did you guys find a host?
7937000	7939000	Nope.
7939000	7941000	We could do the Skype host thing,
7941000	7942000	but I don't know.
7942000	7943000	Like, a lot of this show,
7943000	7944000	you have to remember the history of this show.
7944000	7946000	We've always been in one room together.
7946000	7948000	So, you know, whereas taking calls on Skype is one thing,
7948000	7950000	to have the host on Skype is weird.
7950000	7951000	To me, anyway.
7951000	7954000	I understand TR has filled in when I'm not here,
7954000	7957000	and that's different because Jamie MCs those shows,
7957000	7960000	so that works out a lot better.
7960000	7961000	But, yeah, I don't know.
7961000	7964000	Not being able to see the co-host thing is weird for me.
7964000	7965000	But then again, Hoard House works okay.
7965000	7966000	I can't explain it.
7966000	7967000	I can't.
7967000	7968000	It's just O-L-R's got a formula.
7968000	7970000	You gotta stick to it.
7970000	7973000	Moving on to some tweets from Tiger Claw.
7973000	7975000	Tiger Claw, ooh, reminds me of something that happened
7975000	7977000	in World of Warcraft today.
7977000	7980000	I did not experience this, but I heard about it.
7980000	7982000	Apparently, and they're blaming this on a hacker.
7982000	7983000	Yeah, I just was reading that.
7983000	7987000	Yeah, apparently, a bunch of people were insta-killed
7987000	7988000	in the big city of Stormwind,
7988000	7990000	which is like the Alliance capital.
7990000	7994000	This is happening in Orgrimmar as well, the Hoard capital.
7994000	7998000	These were mostly happening on the European servers.
7998000	8000000	They started spreading to other zones as well,
8000000	8003000	and I guess US servers were starting to get hit as well.
8003000	8006000	Level one characters were somehow insta-killing
8006000	8010000	everybody in the area and the subsequent graveyards.
8010000	8013000	So, yeah, crazy stuff.
8013000	8014000	No official comment from Blizzard,
8014000	8016000	but I will say the servers were down,
8016000	8018000	and then the authentication servers were down as well
8018000	8020000	for quite a bit this morning.
8020000	8022000	I tried to play around 11 a.m., and I couldn't.
8022000	8025000	So I think they were trying to fix this as it was happening.
8025000	8027000	I'm sure Blizzard's seen this.
8027000	8029000	They certainly follow the fan sites,
8029000	8031000	and I can't believe everybody and their mother
8031000	8033000	wasn't filing a complaint about the characters.
8033000	8037000	So they will find the IPs, and they will obliterate them.
8037000	8040000	Wow, that's a pretty interesting picture
8040000	8041000	that they've got for that.
8041000	8045000	I guess it's just this massive pile of skeletons.
8045000	8047000	Yeah, yeah, because once you res,
8047000	8049000	your little skeleton stays there.
8049000	8051000	So it's really funny to see raid rooms
8051000	8053000	when you're working on a boss or something.
8053000	8055000	There'll just be piles of skeletons everywhere
8055000	8058000	so you got shy listeners tonight.
8058000	8060000	Or does the number not work?
8060000	8062000	I don't know what's happening there.
8062000	8064000	1877 game olr again.
8064000	8068000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8068000	8070000	Let me make sure the number's working tonight
8070000	8072000	because you know that was the problem last week.
8072000	8074000	What is wrong with this thing, man?
8074000	8077000	Angry Birds Star Wars Jenga?
8077000	8082000	So that's like a three-way crossover there.
8082000	8083000	Yeah, Angry Birds Star Wars.
8083000	8086000	Let's just throw everything and see if one of them sticks.
8086000	8089000	This is ridiculous.
8089000	8093000	Because Star Wars needed more Angry Birds.
8093000	8094000	I don't know if we mentioned this.
8094000	8098000	Atlas is publishing all the Calypso stuff now.
8098000	8099000	Really?
8099000	8100000	Yeah.
8100000	8102000	I didn't know that.
8102000	8103000	Yeah, that's kind of weird.
8103000	8105000	Or distributing, maybe.
8105000	8108000	This other link here from Tigerclaw is kind of sad.
8108000	8109000	Oh, we got a call coming in.
8109000	8110000	Oh, this should be interesting.
8110000	8112000	Let's go to the phones.
8112000	8113000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8113000	8114000	Who's this?
8114000	8115000	Does your Skype work yet?
8115000	8116000	Yes, it works.
8116000	8122000	I called it from my phone and just verified the 800 number was working.
8122000	8123000	Yeah, it's working.
8123000	8124000	This is Bobby.
8124000	8125000	This is your opening act.
8125000	8128000	Of course, our co-headliner.
8128000	8129000	How are you, Bobby Blackwolf?
8129000	8130000	I'm doing good.
8130000	8135000	I've been in your position where I'm sitting there asking for calls,
8135000	8136000	so I figured I'd help you guys out.
8136000	8138000	I appreciate it.
8139000	8140000	You've always been very good.
8140000	8143000	You've literally had us on every episode of your show,
8143000	8145000	save one or two when we're not here,
8145000	8148000	for the past several years going back to the old network.
8148000	8151000	So it's really only fair that you get to come on this show,
8151000	8153000	and we try to plug you every week.
8153000	8154000	That's right.
8154000	8155000	We've got to hear from you as well.
8155000	8159000	So you've had a series of pretty good episodes lately,
8159000	8163000	and you were at a convention this weekend to get even more interviews, right?
8163000	8164000	That's right.
8164000	8166000	I was at Siege this weekend,
8166000	8169000	which is the Southern Interactive Entertainment and Game Expo.
8169000	8172000	I think of it more like GDC rather than E3,
8172000	8176000	but basically a lot of students were there about getting into the industry
8176000	8178000	and things like that, and it was really interesting.
8178000	8182000	I got to meet a lot of great indie developers,
8182000	8184000	primarily here in the Southeast,
8184000	8189000	and hopefully lined up some stuff for us to cover in the future here at VoG.
8189000	8191000	So I'm really excited about that,
8191000	8193000	and a lot of people are really excited about VoG.
8193000	8198000	Sometimes I've really pushed VoG as a network really hard on people.
8198000	8200000	And one of our first times in print.
8200000	8206000	I saw the tweet with the little logo in the program.
8206000	8210000	That's actually in the program that everybody got and probably didn't read.
8210000	8212000	That happens. That's all right.
8212000	8215000	No, actually they all did read it because that had the schedule of all the panels.
8215000	8218000	And I heard the VoG logo was above the Microsoft logo.
8218000	8219000	It is.
8219000	8220000	Amazing.
8220000	8221000	Yes.
8221000	8222000	We're coming for you, Gates.
8222000	8223000	That's right.
8223000	8225000	You had a pretty neat interview tonight on your show.
8225000	8229000	Tonight I was talking to Dustin Clingman.
8229000	8234000	He is the chairman of the International Game Developers Association.
8234000	8238000	And you were talking about that I've done some interesting episodes.
8238000	8241000	I've started trying to theme what I'm doing instead of just talking about the news.
8241000	8246000	If there's a theme I can do, and if it's more like a discussion topic,
8246000	8248000	I'll talk about it.
8248000	8253000	A couple of weeks ago, I did a whole theme on people getting laid off.
8253000	8256000	I'm tired of talking about people getting laid off.
8256000	8261000	He did his keynote speech at Siege about a time for optimism.
8261000	8266000	And it was talking about how you should be optimistic about the game industry in spite of...
8266000	8271000	And he actually put out 120 studios have closed in the last five or six years.
8271000	8272000	Oh, my God.
8272000	8274000	That's the official number.
8274000	8276000	120 have closed in the last five or six years.
8276000	8278000	And all this stuff, people are leaving.
8278000	8281000	Zinga's stock price dropped to this.
8281000	8284000	And he did this entire keynote about why you should still be optimistic.
8284000	8289000	And so I interviewed him and basically tried to distill his one-hour keynote
8289000	8291000	and do a little 25-minute interview.
8291000	8295000	But I basically asked him, why should we be optimistic?
8295000	8297000	And just let him talk.
8297000	8301000	And one of the questions you asked him was about the video game crash as well.
8301000	8305000	And you kind of asked, do you think we'll see something like we saw in the early 80s happen again?
8305000	8307000	And he said no. And he had his reasons.
8307000	8313000	As a consumer, I'm not sure I necessarily agreed with everything he said.
8313000	8320000	But I get the optimism and the fact that for every door that closes, another opens.
8320000	8323000	And that there's this whole mobile thing is now the fad, I guess.
8323000	8328000	And maybe we're seeing less AAA things and more mobile things.
8328000	8330000	But I don't know. I kind of wonder.
8331000	8334000	Part of the reason the Atari 2600 and all that collapsed
8334000	8338000	was that you had this oversaturation of these little games.
8338000	8341000	Although, granted, they were charging full price for them at the time.
8341000	8344000	And mobile games are more in the 99-cent, $2 size.
8344000	8348000	And his thing was that the reason that also the crash happened
8348000	8352000	is because stores just stopped wanting to carry him because they couldn't return him.
8352000	8354000	And that's the crux of his argument.
8354000	8356000	He talks about it a little bit more.
8356000	8358000	Because he talks about returns.
8358000	8361000	And then I do ask him, so used games?
8361000	8363000	And that's a different thing.
8363000	8371000	But nowadays, for retail products, if the Evil-G doesn't sell through Naughty Bear 2 or whatever,
8371000	8375000	they can actually send it back and get a little bit of their money back.
8375000	8378000	So it's not a complete loss on their inventory.
8378000	8383000	Whereas back in the days of the Atari 2600 and the other 12 consoles that were out in 1982,
8383000	8384000	that wasn't the case.
8384000	8387000	And with Apple, there is no upfront cost.
8387000	8388000	Let me jump in with Loki.
8388000	8392000	Loki, the man who works for the distribution company, you say that's not totally true.
8392000	8393000	That's not true. It's all one-way sale.
8393000	8395000	They do not allow returns.
8395000	8396000	Well then why would...
8396000	8398000	Is that maybe just your arrangement?
8398000	8400000	No, I think it's mass retailers.
8400000	8404000	And the reason why they do that, that's why they do a pre-order program.
8404000	8408000	Because otherwise they can buy a bunch of stuff and then return it all.
8408000	8409000	But it's all one way.
8409000	8412000	I think what it is now is they get a lot more perks.
8412000	8416000	They get a lot more back-end rebates and a lot of price protections and all that fun stuff.
8416000	8420000	But no, it's definitely there are no returns on that stuff.
8420000	8423000	Because the publishers do not want to be sitting on that stuff.
8423000	8424000	Interesting.
8424000	8425000	And is that why Amazon...
8425000	8430000	Isn't that part of the rumors why Amazon stopped carrying a lot of the Nintendo hardware?
8430000	8433000	Well, the Effectives are a little different.
8433000	8435000	But yeah, once again you have to...
8435000	8441000	Usually what they'll do with Effectives is they'll want the consumer to go through the proper routes through the publishers.
8441000	8443000	Or the hardware manufacturers.
8443000	8448000	They want a person that buys an Xbox 360 to go to Microsoft and have that repaired.
8448000	8450000	But a consumer doesn't care.
8450000	8453000	They're like, well, why did GameStop sell me an Effectives system?
8453000	8455000	I'm going to go back to GameStop and return it instead of actually...
8455000	8459000	Even if there's instructions in the box, do not return this back to the retailer.
8459000	8463000	So of course all that stuff has to be approved.
8463000	8467000	And obviously they're going to approve GameStop over some mom and pop shop.
8467000	8471000	I wish I knew that when I was doing the interview yesterday so I could have called him out on it.
8471000	8474000	Oh, well, now we'll just have to have another interview at some point.
8474000	8475000	That's right.
8475000	8478000	Or we'll invite him on OLR, let Loki grill him.
8478000	8482000	No, but it was a good interview and the fact that he was pretty open.
8482000	8489000	You did have some tough questions and that's always great when an interviewee can handle those questions.
8489000	8492000	Alright, so I have to ask you about something you didn't talk about.
8492000	8493000	Okay.
8493000	8495000	But you did talk about it on Twitter, so that's why I know it's fair game.
8495000	8497000	Because you did post about it on Twitter.
8497000	8500000	You got to tell me about what's happening with a certain voice actor.
8500000	8501000	Oh, God.
8501000	8503000	What's up with this?
8503000	8511000	Well, actually I phrased it on my private Facebook profile a little bit better.
8511000	8517000	Because my friends on Facebook know why this is amazing.
8517000	8520000	A little bit more than what people on Twitter would do.
8520000	8524000	But I will tell you this, I am not the type of person to go near a dance floor.
8525000	8532000	But I like going to concerts and stuff because I'm a musician, so I'm actually watching the musician.
8532000	8537000	And so I've actually never been really on a dance floor.
8537000	8543000	Usually I can get out of being pulled onto a dance floor.
8543000	8545000	And Professor Shy Guy was playing.
8545000	8547000	All those years of DDR did nothing?
8547000	8548000	No.
8548000	8550000	You got to realize, I did an arrow stomp.
8550000	8551000	Alright, alright.
8551000	8553000	My bimani was fingers.
8553000	8555000	You were a bimani guy. Okay, fair enough.
8555000	8560000	So, he's playing and stuff.
8560000	8563000	And he's big on wanting people right in front of the stage dancing.
8563000	8572000	And apparently him and Ellen McClain, who's the voice of GLaDOS, actually have done different cons together.
8572000	8573000	So they know each other.
8573000	8575000	And I've gotten to know her too.
8575000	8578000	This is the third con I've seen her at.
8579000	8584000	So she got pulled up to the dance floor by somebody.
8584000	8588000	So I'm kind of sitting there. I actually have some pictures of her dancing up there, which is great.
8588000	8590000	And then he's like, okay, everybody here go out and get somebody.
8590000	8593000	And Ellen McClain comes right to me.
8593000	8595000	And she's like, come on.
8595000	8597000	And I do the whole no thing.
8597000	8599000	And she gives me this look.
8599000	8602000	Like, the motherly, you're going to do this.
8602000	8604000	I said so.
8604000	8614000	When the voice of GLaDOS comes up to you and just stares at you, saying you're going to do this, and starts pulling, you don't resist.
8614000	8616000	You don't say no to GLaDOS. You don't.
8616000	8617000	You don't.
8617000	8627000	So the way I phrase it is I don't know what's more impressive, the fact that I got on a dance floor and danced for two songs, or that it was by the voice of GLaDOS.
8627000	8630000	That's a great story. Love it.
8630000	8633000	And thankfully, there's no video of it.
8633000	8635000	And there never will.
8635000	8637000	I have no clue what I'm doing up there.
8637000	8644000	And she was trying. She was wearing this, I don't even know what the clothing thing is called, but it's something that she wears over her shoulders.
8644000	8648000	She was actually using that and wrapping it around me and doing something.
8648000	8650000	Whoa!
8650000	8652000	Yeah, I know. John Patrick Lowry, you're on notice.
8652000	8658000	Whoa! This is like getting to be Dancing with the Stars level scandal right here.
8659000	8665000	ActDeaf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Ellen made Black Wolf his slave. For science. I think you meant her slave.
8665000	8667000	Yeah, her. She's definitely a woman.
8667000	8669000	Yes. Definitely.
8669000	8671000	For science.
8671000	8682000	And then he said, okay, everybody go out and get more, so she took me by the hand and we found two other people, and then she handed me off to the other woman, and she took the...yeah.
8682000	8686000	There you go. Who knew that you and GLaDOS would become besties?
8686000	8690000	I know. We're buds now.
8690000	8706000	And somewhere, somewhere, distantly, I can hear the people who used to fear you as the sheriff with the ban hammer at certain other communities we've been in in the past, finding you and GLaDOS having a friendship most appropriate.
8706000	8708000	Yes.
8708000	8715000	And it's all because her husband wasn't there. He didn't make it, so, you know, she just let loose.
8715000	8723000	That's amazing. That's a great story. And this is a SiegeCon. The GDC. This is fun. It sounds fun.
8723000	8730000	And she was the only kind of voice actor. She was the only voice actor there. This wasn't DragonCon. This is the little GDC-type con.
8730000	8743000	Right. Well, I hope that she will come to GamerCon in San Francisco, where they've announced the venue is going to be in Japantown at the Kabuki in the Tomo, which is, I believe, August next year.
8743000	8756000	And she was in one of the commercials, as was her husband. I think some people at PAX got her to do the plugs for GamerCon. And I'm hoping she's there, because you know the GamerCon dance is going to be off the hook.
8756000	8757000	Oh, yeah.
8757000	8762000	And I plan to walk up to her and go, and I'll just say, hey, I'm a friend of Bobby Blackwell's.
8762000	8771000	There you go. She does know that name now. She does remember that. We've met three times, so she now knows me.
8771000	8777000	There you go. Now all the listeners are going to try that at a convention. Don't you dare.
8777000	8780000	Dude, you could tell her that you heard her on VOG Network.
8780000	8781000	There you go.
8781000	8792000	Because she did, and I know I told you this, and we haven't started putting these on the stream. She did multiple bumpers for VOG on Saturday.
8792000	8793000	Amazing.
8793000	8795000	Multiple. She did three of them.
8795000	8802000	Hopefully one of those is a nomination for, you know, Orange Lounge Radio for the podcast.
8802000	8804000	Yes, Bobby is going to get her to do it.
8804000	8806000	Hey, you know what? Whatever.
8806000	8809000	Don't vote for my show. Vote for Orange Lounge Radio.
8809000	8810000	No, they can do both.
8810000	8812000	I was at the top of Bobby's list, I'm sure, Loki.
8812000	8814000	You can do both. Come on.
8814000	8815000	Yeah, dummy.
8815000	8821000	I didn't ever do a bumper for me. It was a bumper for VOG. Because I plan to promote the whole network.
8821000	8828000	Yes, exactly. As we've been saying. Even if you're not going to vote for us, vote VOG.
8828000	8830000	Oh, I like the ring for that. Vote VOG.
8830000	8834000	There you go. Well, why didn't we think of that when it started on October 1st?
8834000	8839000	Damn it. We still have a few days left. We have until the 15th. Frisbee in chat says, Ellen bumped for VOG.
8839000	8841000	Yeah.
8841000	8842000	Amazing.
8843000	8846000	Alright, well, Bobby, thank you for sharing your stories from SiegeCon.
8846000	8850000	And, of course, you've got more interviews coming up throughout the week on your own show,
8850000	8857000	which I can't believe anybody who's listened to OLR at this point hasn't heard your show at one point or another.
8857000	8862000	But if for some crazy-ass reason they have still not heard your show, how can they find you, Bobby?
8862000	8868000	VOGnetwork.com is actually where I point everybody to go to my episodes now.
8868000	8871000	Yeah, we do that for Hoard House and OLR, too.
8871000	8875000	Yeah, because there's comment sections and people actually comment.
8875000	8879000	Last week, I put in the developer's YouTube video that I kept playing over and over again,
8879000	8884000	and the visual is just as scary as the audio for that.
8884000	8891000	And the upcoming shows next week, I have a live interview with The Game Recruiter.
8891000	8895000	He actually is the CEO of GameRecruiter.com, Mark Mencher.
8895000	8899000	He is going to be taking live chat questions as well about getting into the industry,
8899000	8903000	but I'm also going to ask him how he can stay at your job and what needs to happen to stop all these layoffs.
8903000	8907000	He doesn't know I'm going to ask him that yet, but I'm going to run it by him.
8907000	8913000	And then I've got a couple pre-recorded interviews I'm going to be playing throughout the next couple weeks.
8913000	8916000	Tom Buscaglia, who is The Game Attorney.
8916000	8921000	So we have The Game Recruiter, and then the next week The Game Attorney from GameAttorney.com.
8921000	8929000	He's mostly general counsel to a lot of independent game developers and indie game developers,
8929000	8938000	and he works with new studios on actually not letting themselves get screwed by legal documents and stuff.
8938000	8940000	So we talk about some of the stuff he does.
8940000	8946000	And then I did actually play test a game while at Siege, and I interviewed their CEO in indie game.
8946000	8951000	First-person magic game using the Crytek 3 engine.
8951000	8956000	We should have got that lawyer guy to represent VOG for certain things I won't talk about.
8956000	8959000	Well, we talked a little bit.
8959000	8960000	Oh, okay.
8960000	8964000	It's kind of funny, and also when you listen to that interview, here's a spoiler line from the interview.
8964000	8968000	He talks about how he's general counsel to a lot of people, and I actually mentioned to him,
8968000	8971000	I'm like, yeah, you're the general counsel for everybody that's here except me.
8971000	8973000	And he's like, well, maybe not for long.
8973000	8979000	Nice, nice. Very cool.
8979000	8987000	So that's all the fun stuff coming up on the Bobby Black Wolf show, and then hopefully I'll be doing more themed stuff as well.
8987000	8989000	What big interviews do we have coming up, Loki?
8989000	8992000	What do we have to compete with Bobby here on Orange Monster Radio?
8992000	8995000	What big interviews have we landed for the rest of the year?
8996000	9004000	Let's see, well, next week we've got Cliffy B and Miyamoto's the week after that.
9004000	9007000	I do want to – can I throw one more thing in? Can I take one more minute?
9007000	9008000	I suppose.
9008000	9014000	Okay, so when I got there Friday, I saw the Microsoft booth, and it was the Windows 8 developer booth,
9014000	9018000	and the guy behind it, and I was like, so, what do you do?
9018000	9023000	He's like, oh, I'm the developer evangelist for Windows Mobile programming and Windows 8 programming and blah, blah, blah.
9023000	9027000	I'm like, oh, so can I ask you something about Xbox Live Indie games?
9027000	9029000	Like, sure.
9029000	9032000	And I'm like, so, blah, blah, blah, prepaid codes, blah, blah, blah.
9032000	9036000	And I basically go through the whole thing about the prepaid codes that I know you guys covered as well.
9036000	9040000	I hadn't heard of that. Was that like a developer here that's having problems?
9040000	9042000	I'm like, no, it's every developer.
9042000	9044000	No, it's the entirety of the internet.
9044000	9052000	Yes. And he's like, I have not heard of that, but if you give me more information about it, I will start an email chain inside Microsoft.
9052000	9059000	And I'm like, okay. And so I found his Twitter, and I tweeted him the link to our article, and I'm like, it's been three weeks and counting.
9059000	9064000	Because we actually got a comment on our site from one of the other independent developers that actually posted a statement.
9064000	9065000	I saw.
9065000	9071000	About how he's stopping support for all Microsoft platforms until they fix the prepaid codes issue.
9071000	9075000	Are you saying VOG Network may save Xbox Live Indie games?
9075000	9076000	I hope so.
9076000	9077000	That would be amazing.
9077000	9080000	Because nobody else writing about this except me.
9080000	9081000	Weird.
9081000	9082000	Got Reddit love from it.
9082000	9083000	Love it.
9083000	9087000	All right, well, Bobby, we should let you go to see if anybody else is going to take a chance on calling in tonight.
9087000	9093000	But I'm really glad you did have an opportunity, whatever the reason, to come on the show and plug all the good stuff you're doing right now.
9093000	9095000	I just wanted to test your Skype, actually.
9095000	9096000	All right, well, it works.
9096000	9097000	And I like the pop filters.
9097000	9099000	Yeah. Oh, do you?
9099000	9100000	Yeah.
9100000	9104000	Some of the new stuff, our new toys, we all have the same mic now, too.
9104000	9109000	I don't know if that was out there before, but we used to have three different microphones, two different types of connections.
9109000	9110000	It was all different.
9110000	9112000	But now everything is the same.
9112000	9114000	And you guys are growing up.
9114000	9116000	And a condenser mic in the studio now.
9116000	9117000	Ooh.
9117000	9118000	Ooh.
9118000	9119000	I did that for the voiceover in the intro.
9119000	9120000	That's why it sounds a little different.
9120000	9121000	Awesome.
9121000	9122000	All right.
9122000	9123000	Take care, Bobby.
9123000	9124000	Take care.
9124000	9125000	All right, bye.
9125000	9128000	Thanks again to Brad from Pod Culture, because I know he's listening.
9128000	9129000	They're fantastic.
9129000	9130000	What, the mics?
9130000	9131000	Yeah.
9131000	9132000	Oh, yeah, they're great.
9132000	9133000	And plus, I color coded them.
9133000	9134000	Did you notice?
9134000	9135000	There's the same colors that they are in the show role.
9135000	9138000	I have a green one, you have a blue one, and she's going to have a pink one.
9138000	9139000	Nice.
9139000	9140000	Which she'll hate, but oh well.
9140000	9144000	Now we need to get the fancy, like, you know how they have the blocks on there that have
9144000	9146000	the network logo and stuff?
9146000	9148000	Yes, we could do that.
9148000	9150000	That's cheesy and stuff, butcher.
9150000	9156000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio, if you want to give us
9156000	9157000	a call.
9157000	9160000	The only thing, I've got to find the stand for this condenser mic.
9160000	9161000	He sent everything.
9161000	9163000	I've got to find my old condenser mic.
9163000	9165000	I have a condenser mic somewhere.
9165000	9166000	I don't even know where the hell it is.
9166000	9167000	And you know what?
9167000	9170000	That condenser mic and this condenser mic both have the same problem.
9170000	9172000	They have crazy-ass gain on them.
9172000	9177000	They're like, that thing, if I turn that thing on, you'll be able to hear the fan going above
9177000	9178000	here.
9178000	9179000	It's crazy, but I like it.
9179000	9182000	It's just, you know, crazy, crazy.
9182000	9185000	Black Wolf is popping up in chat saying, mic flags.
9185000	9187000	That's the official term for them.
9187000	9188000	There you go.
9188000	9189000	Nice.
9189000	9193000	And then the good news is, because he sent us all those mics, we still, I mean, these
9193000	9197000	mics aren't bad that we have, so it'll be a great mobile kit so we can set up, you know,
9197000	9199000	a better way to do OLR on the go.
9199000	9200000	All right.
9200000	9204000	We'll give it one more chance for calls, and then I'm going to shut it down and close out
9204000	9205000	the show.
9205000	9206000	1877 game OLR.
9206000	9208000	Our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9208000	9212000	I did have another tweet topic that Tiger Claw sent.
9212000	9215000	It's not a great story, though.
9215000	9216000	It's kind of one of those.
9216000	9220000	This is really unfortunate, but I will go ahead and share it with you guys here.
9220000	9222000	This is somewhat local, too.
9222000	9226000	This happened in Hercules, California, which is one of those towns you pass going to the
9226000	9229000	Bay Area before you hit the Bay Bridge in Oakland and all that.
9229000	9235000	Well, unfortunately, the mother of Neversoft concept artist Simon Coe was murdered.
9235000	9237000	That's really tragic.
9237000	9243000	ABC News 7 was reporting that Susie Coe was found in her home Friday evening while the
9243000	9247000	family's sky blue 2011 Subaru Outback is also missing.
9247000	9250000	The police have no motive or suspects to the death.
9250000	9253000	They are asking anyone in the area with information to call the police.
9253000	9257000	510-724-1111.
9257000	9258000	That's very tragic.
9258000	9260000	I'm really sorry to hear about that.
9260000	9263000	We have a call coming in, so let's take the call.
9263000	9264000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9264000	9265000	Who's this?
9265000	9266000	Hey, this is Akdeft.
9266000	9267000	Hey, Akdeft.
9267000	9269000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9269000	9271000	Nothing much.
9271000	9277000	I was also trying to call you earlier to test your Skype, but it seems it works.
9277000	9278000	Yep, it works.
9278000	9279000	Hooray.
9279000	9282000	Well, what have you been playing lately?
9282000	9291000	Well, actually, I do have a topic in mind, especially with a game that came today.
9291000	9293000	Pokémon.
9293000	9299000	It actually has gotten reviews below 8, but it hasn't been below 7.
9299000	9303000	It's around the 7 or 8 mark.
9303000	9313000	But it's something that has bugged me since I started reading and probably writing reviews.
9313000	9318000	It's that any game below 8 is automatically bad.
9318000	9320000	It's stable like that.
9320000	9322000	Why do you think that is?
9322000	9323000	Yeah.
9323000	9325000	And I don't know why.
9325000	9330000	It's something that the whole internet is like, oh my god, it got a 7.
9330000	9331000	It's bad.
9331000	9333000	I don't understand that.
9333000	9336000	I really don't get it.
9336000	9340000	Well, that's what leads to this whole artificial inflation of gamer scores, too.
9340000	9341000	I'm not talking about the Xbox kind.
9341000	9343000	I'm talking about review scores.
9343000	9348000	An average game, an okay game, should be a 5, shouldn't it?
9348000	9350000	But that's really not the way it is.
9350000	9352000	Average games in this day and age kind of tend to get a 7.
9352000	9354000	If you give a game a 5, it's a stinker.
9354000	9359000	That's why at VoG Network, we prefer to use the grading scale that you have from high schools and stuff
9359000	9363000	because the A to F scale is a little more realistic.
9363000	9366000	But here's why I think 7s also feel really harsh.
9366000	9370000	How much are they charging for Pokémon Black 2, White 2?
9370000	9372000	Aren't these like $40 games?
9372000	9374000	$35, I think.
9374000	9375000	$35.
9375000	9376000	Okay, well still, that's a big chunk of change.
9376000	9377000	That's the high end on a DS game.
9377000	9378000	Yeah, that's the high end on a DS game.
9378000	9383000	And most games that are reviewed for the console systems, you're talking $50, $60 games.
9383000	9388000	When you're going to drop that much money on a game, are you going to drop $60 on something average?
9388000	9400000	Well, it depends because if the game is fun, if the game will accomplish what it's set for, to be entertaining,
9400000	9403000	it should be worth it.
9403000	9405000	At least in my opinion.
9405000	9407000	Right.
9407000	9413000	Well, I mean, if you're a fan of a particular genre, you'll forgive a lot of flaws.
9413000	9418000	And obviously, there's Pokémon fans who are going to buy this game no matter what.
9418000	9423000	I did find it interesting though, Shane and I were texting each other a little bit earlier today.
9423000	9424000	I don't know if he's still listening.
9424000	9425000	He said he was listening for a bit.
9425000	9435000	But he was telling me that there's some online title that was released that in some ways, I guess it was only $3 in the 3DS eShop.
9435000	9440000	And in some ways, it's better than the actual Pokémon game that came out today.
9441000	9443000	Just with some of the ways it's different and so forth.
9443000	9444000	Let me see.
9444000	9450000	Hopefully, he won't mind if I read a little bit of the message here, the relevant parts here.
9450000	9452000	What is it?
9452000	9457000	Okay, he said it's $2.99 and what's it called?
9457000	9459000	Pokémon Dream Radar.
9459000	9462000	You can catch Pokémon you can't get in the game.
9462000	9465000	It uses AR like Face Raider so it's not obnoxious.
9465000	9469000	And for the most part, you never know what Pokémon you're capturing until after you catch it.
9469000	9471000	It gives it replayability.
9471000	9474000	Also, it gives me something to spend play coins on again.
9474000	9477000	I guess those coins you get when you walk and so forth.
9477000	9487000	Sounds like in some ways, the $3 title might be providing as much value as the $35 title and that's an issue.
9487000	9490000	But of course, that's one person's opinion.
9490000	9494000	Well, like I said, it can be entertaining.
9494000	9498000	The price in this case is that you're paying for...
9498000	9501000	Well, it's supposed to be a full game.
9501000	9507000	At least you're going to be playing at least for 20 hours.
9507000	9514000	You can probably play a Pokémon game in that time and beat it to an extent.
9516000	9523000	I do get the value in how much of a replay you're going to get.
9523000	9532000	But like I said, if the game is entertaining, if you can enjoy it, then it shouldn't be labeled as bad.
9532000	9535000	Especially with a 7, it should be an average.
9535000	9539000	And I do get why the game might get that score.
9539000	9543000	But telling people that it's a bad game?
9545000	9550000	It's like if I were saying that a certain game...
9550000	9558000	I won't name any game in particular, but it has good graphics, it has good music, and it's fun.
9558000	9563000	But it has some very bad flaws and it has some bugs.
9563000	9565000	But overall, it's good.
9565000	9572000	I'm going to give it a 3, for example, instead of a 7 or a 6, probably, that it should get.
9572000	9580000	Is it maybe bad in a relative sense, where this game is getting review scores that are lower than the other Pokémon games?
9580000	9590000	So either A, people are feeling burnout, or B, it's not a bad game per se, but it's a bad Pokémon game because all the other Pokémon games are so good.
9590000	9594000	And this one's not really the best in the series.
9594000	9599000	Probably a former, since most people have been talking about that.
9599000	9602000	The gameplay has gotten pretty repetitive.
9602000	9608000	It hasn't changed, but then again, if it isn't broke, why fix it?
9608000	9610000	I guess that's true.
9610000	9613000	Alright, Akdeft, anything else you want to say tonight?
9613000	9615000	No, nothing.
9615000	9618000	Just expect a few... well, a little plug here.
9618000	9623000	Just expect a few little new articles from I Love That Song.
9623000	9628000	Especially since Halloween is coming, so it will be fun.
9628000	9633000	Yep, I'm behind on posting articles, but I know you've got some great stuff in the queue.
9633000	9638000	And when all this other mess in my life is over, I'll be able to focus on that again, so it'll be great.
9638000	9642000	Don't worry about that. It will get done eventually.
9642000	9645000	Yes, it will, it will. I won't let it fall off the radar.
9645000	9647000	Alright, you take care, buddy. Thanks for calling.
9647000	9648000	You too, thanks.
9648000	9649000	Alright, bye.
9650000	9656000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if anybody else wants to call in.
9656000	9660000	Are you out of stuff to talk about, Loki? I can't remember if you had anything else left.
9661000	9666000	I was just looking at some of the stuff. Just going through different websites and stuff.
9666000	9673000	Apparently, in the manual for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, they have an advertisement for the Pokedex 3D Pro.
9673000	9678000	It's coming November 8th, and for $15 on the eShop.
9678000	9683000	That's why the old one's no longer available. It all makes sense now.
9684000	9685000	I see.
9686000	9693000	See, over 640 Pokemon in full 3D. Yeah, that's worth 15 bucks. Fuck you, Nintendo.
9695000	9701000	So there's that. There was another thing I saw. There was another hack on the Vita, actually.
9701000	9705000	Because I do follow Dash hacks, and they post that stuff.
9705000	9709000	It's been not patched, but they removed the game that had the exploit for it.
9709000	9714000	But it allowed people to run a custom firmware for the PSP on their Vita.
9714000	9720000	So they can run a custom firmware for 6.6, and it'll actually allow you to run ISOs for the PSP and stuff.
9720000	9726000	But of course, they've removed that game off of the PlayStation Store, so you can't get it.
9727000	9740000	And unfortunately, that was the whole issue where someone leaked part of the guy's hack, and so he left the community.
9740000	9748000	And now, because of that, there's not really going to be a jailbreak on the Vita yet, at least not by that method.
9749000	9750000	Alright.
9751000	9756000	Well, it is 9 o'clock, and it looks like no more calls are coming in, so I guess we're going to close up the Skype line.
9756000	9761000	Thanks to those that did call in tonight, and if you think of something a little later on, you can always email us.
9761000	9765000	Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com, or of course, there is always Twitter.
9765000	9771000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R, or our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.
9771000	9774000	But it is time to wrap up the show tonight.
9774000	9779000	I want to thank all you guys for listening this week, be it live or on our podcast feed.
9779000	9784000	Remember, if you like the show, all we ask, help spread the word about the show, leave us a nice review.
9784000	9789000	Wherever you happen to be listening to this show, be it through iTunes or Stitcher or Recommendation or what have you.
9789000	9792000	There's the award stuff I've talked about plenty tonight.
9792000	9796000	And yeah, just please help spread the word about the show.
9796000	9799000	We'll be back to do it again next week with Dark Sakura.
9799000	9803000	She'll be back from Disney next week, and who knows what will happen in gaming this week.
9803000	9806000	We're starting to ramp up into that really busy holiday time of year.
9806000	9811000	So out of all those games coming out, it'll be interesting to see which ones we play.
9811000	9815000	And by this time next week, this play stuff I'm doing will be over with.
9815000	9819000	So I'll be able to kind of focus on this stuff again, which will be great.
9819000	9823000	Uh, Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
9823000	9830000	My final thought is I don't know why I keep getting updates for Stitcher on, um, there, you freaking app.
9830000	9831000	Bye-bye app.
9831000	9832000	What happened?
9832000	9839000	I don't know. It's somehow Stitcher added itself to my Facebook, and I keep getting, like, updates for, like, Stitcher stuff.
9839000	9843000	Oh, maybe because you voted in the award thing or something. Who knows?
9843000	9845000	Oh, probably. Thank you!
9845000	9851000	You can all, if just, you know, although we like Stitcher, you could always unlike it after voting if you need to.
9851000	9853000	So, alright.
9853000	9864000	Alright, uh, my final thought tonight is, um, seeing Loki's McDonald's bag makes me think that I just impromptu had McDonald's for breakfast yesterday and a sausage biscuit.
9864000	9868000	Good times. Totally not healthy, but good times.
9868000	9871000	I just got a free, was it? Free McFlurry.
9871000	9873000	Ooh, we playing Monopoly?
9873000	9882000	God, it's so pathetic. I've gotten McDonald's the last few days because I ran out of stuff to make lunches with, and it's literally almost the same game pieces every time.
9882000	9890000	I'm like, they're not even trying anymore. It's like, there's, like, no, I've gotten Boardwalk, or done Boardwalk Park plays, like, three times already. I'm like, fuck this.
9890000	9893000	Because they want to get you really excited about maybe having that million.
9893000	9896000	Oh, yeah, I'm totally gonna win one million dollars. Yeah, it's like...
9896000	9899000	Which is payable in twenty yearly installments or something, so it's like...
9899000	9901000	Hey, I don't care. That's still a million dollars.
9901000	9902000	Still a million dollars.
9902000	9906000	I don't care. That's fine. I'll take that.
9907000	9912000	Alright, thanks everybody for tuning into another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back next week to do it all over again.
9912000	9917000	In the meantime, continue to support independent podcasting, and we'll see you next week. Bye, everybody.
9936000	9948000	Views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or Fogg Network, but you know they were all still true.
9948000	9950000	See you next week.
