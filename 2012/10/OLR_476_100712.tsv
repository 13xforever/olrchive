13981	25231	Tonight, October 7th, 2012, Sony sues a former spokesman, cheating allegations emerge in the playoffs of one PC game competition, and could pornography be on the way to the Xbox 360?
31627	36750	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36790	43734	It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 476 for October the 7th of 2012.
45655	53259	If you happen to be listening to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, head on over to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.
53699	58882	If you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or some other type of smartphone application...
59182	63447	Well, that's cool too, but please pencil us in some time for a live show.
63507	71355	We do tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
71756	79865	We are here to talk about video games and all that good stuff with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host tonight here, Loki.
80345	80745	Hi!
80765	81926	How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?
81966	82787	I'm doing fine.
83067	83327	Yes.
83988	84748	What's new with you?
84808	85429	How was your day?
86069	87570	Uh, it was good.
87630	91173	I did a lot of non-gaming stuff, like mowing the backyard.
91353	92814	Damn that real life stuff!
93134	93775	Damn it all!
93915	94876	I've been putting it off for a while.
94896	99399	I'm like, once the weather gets cooler, then I'll do it, and then finally the weather got cooler, so I had to do it.
99879	106344	Alright, now before the chat room starts conspiracy theories, you'll notice I did not introduce DarkSakura.
106845	109307	We do love DarkSakura, but she is not here tonight.
109407	112069	She ditched our ass to go hang with gays at Disneyland.
112589	114651	Which, can you blame her, let's be honest.
115251	116951	It is the happiest place on earth after all.
117271	118892	So she is wrapping up her trip at Disneyland.
119232	120892	She should be back for the next live show.
121552	122833	No sub co-host tonight.
122933	124913	Alan's usually our standby co-host.
124953	125533	He had to work.
125993	132034	I put a call out on Twitter, but I was a little late in doing that because I've been a little bit busy too with some other stuff going on.
132375	139196	So it's just Loki and I here in studio with you guys in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
139216	143677	The always present fourth guest on our show, or I guess tonight, third guest on our show.
144457	148159	BlackWolf in our chat says, I can blame her, just like I blame Rob.
148740	149240	F you, buddy.
151161	152342	What am I being blamed for?
152362	153862	I don't know.
154123	156464	I guess Bobby does not want to go to Disneyland.
156624	160546	Did perhaps you introduce Jamie to the love of Disneyland?
160626	162447	No, no, it was the other way around.
163208	165829	So she was the dealer.
166069	167690	Yes, in this case, Jamie was the dealer.
167770	170232	You remember the OLR lesbians, Chris and Meg Zee?
170452	170932	Big giant pyramid scheme.
190401	192283	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
208598	209919	Who started Minecraft?
209979	211941	Was that me or was that you?
212421	214283	I think that was kind of you on Xbox.
214483	221990	Well, I think we were both on Xbox and then I decided to do the PC version and then unfortunately it was just downhill from there.
223652	225494	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
241011	243652	The officially recognized gayest place on earth would be San Francisco.
245953	248034	Unfortunately, it's just today.
248434	253436	I would argue the gayest place on earth is a Scissor Sisters concert in West Hollywood.
253836	255337	But what do I know?
256477	258778	Once again, that's one of those temporary designations.
258838	259438	I see.
259939	263260	Whereas any other time it goes back to San Francisco.
265014	275504	There actually is, if I remember right, in New York New York listeners, help me out here But right off of Christopher Street, which I recall is the gay district there There is a street called Gay Street
276445	277265	If I remember right.
277925	279326	New York listeners, correct me if I'm wrong.
279346	280386	I know there's several of you listening.
281046	290529	And in our chat room at chat.live.vognetwork.com You have one home for so many years, it's hard to beat it out of your head.
290569	291089	What can I say?
292949	293350	Let's see.
294850	300071	Brad from PodCultures in our chat saying, Rob Roberts, so Disney and games are social diseases now?
300431	302072	Now let's not call it a disease.
304201	306903	Maybe just their distractions.
307103	308524	That's what Ranma confirming for me.
308564	311306	Yes, there is a gay street over in the West Village.
311346	311886	Thank you, Ranma.
312026	316509	You know, if she was rich enough, she would totally be buying that replica Haunted Mansion that they have.
317029	317870	I heard about that.
318210	318991	What is that all about?
319031	322893	Like a four-story actual replica?
322913	326876	Yeah, it's a replica, except when they show the inside, I'm like, that doesn't look like the Haunted Mansion at all.
327036	329057	That doesn't resemble anything that I've seen.
329257	332139	I don't remember there being a nice kitchen set and all this stuff.
333228	335129	I hope it's not the Nightmare Before Christmas version.
335169	335750	Don't get me wrong.
336050	336811	I love Haunted Mansion.
337011	338132	I love Nightmare Before Christmas.
338192	338832	I don't like them.
338852	340133	It's like the Ikea version.
340373	343355	So it's unfortunately a whole other nightmare there.
344396	344716	All right.
344997	348359	Before we get to our gaming weeks, we always like to start off with a kickoff topic.
348759	351782	And I got to tell you, I'm kind of in the same boat as Loki.
351882	354964	We've both been very busy lately just with other stuff going on.
355244	361189	I don't know specifically what Loki's had going on, but I know here locally, I am working very hard with...
362249	368813	Some other people you might know actually, Jessica Harper from Understation Lives, Saturday nights here at VOG Network is a big part of this too.
369314	378179	We're trying to bring the Rocky Horror Picture Show back to Sacramento, which to take a trip down memory lane, I've been involved with Rocky Horror since like 98.
379640	387467	and the first internet radio show I was on after my college radio shtick was Under Station Live, which was born of Rocky Horror.
387828	392211	So you can kind of thank Rocky Horror for getting me into internet radio in the first place in a roundabout way.
392432	398877	Well, it's finally coming back to Sacramento and oh my gosh, it has been a lot, a lot of work and a lot of money and a lot of time.
398937	400399	But you know, it's going to be great.
400579	401560	I really can't wait for the show.
402140	405325	So, it does kind of cut into the gaming time a little bit.
405585	408449	I don't know if you've had the same experience with the stuff you've had going on.
408690	410993	No, I only did the lawn mowing.
411013	413396	That was like two hours of today and that was it.
414117	416321	The rest of the week it hasn't been any of that.
417000	417880	But that's all.
418160	419240	The show is Friday.
419300	424721	If you happen to be in Northern California, I urge you to check it out in Sacramento at the Colonial Theater.
424741	427582	10 o'clock on Friday, October 12th is the big show.
428082	429402	And I'm hosting it.
429622	432463	And it will be a very crazy, different side of me than what you see.
432743	433883	Even worse than Horde House.
434083	435463	So that's all I'm going to say about that.
436863	439084	But yeah, if you're local, please come see the show.
440204	445405	But after that, I will finally have some time to get caught up on a few things that I've been neglecting, like VOG.
445986	449014	and video games, playing games and things like that.
451411	464441	And it's just around the right season for Halloween and scary games and things of that sort going on, which I thought we could talk a little bit about scary video games and games, you know, seasonal Halloween games.
464861	470265	Now, Loki, do you ever play scary games that actually scare you?
470325	478832	Like, I know you maybe don't want to admit this, but do you ever play, like, scary video games that actually make you scared, legit scared?
479232	479672	Thanks for watching!
501907	512273	But no, I honestly don't really play any scary games because I don't have a lot of time for that stuff, let alone time to turn off lights and play a scary game.
512814	518657	I'm not really into Silent Hill, which is fine because all the Silent Hills nowadays are kind of eh.
518993	519213	Yeah.
519894	525378	I remember, though, speaking of Silent Hill, I remember when you and I were living together a while ago.
526118	528020	This has been, like, in the early days of OLR.
528340	531062	That was right when Silent Hill 4, The Room, was new.
531543	534285	And I was playing through that one night, and I legit got scared.
534345	535966	Like, I, like, screamed.
535986	537707	I let out, like, this total, like, girl scream.
537987	539549	Because something really scary happened.
539589	544332	Like, I walked into a room, and there was, like, one of those two-headed baby monsters was coming right at me.
544693	545173	And I'm like, ah!
545874	548937	and you're sitting over there playing Final Fantasy XI or something.
548957	551360	You just kind of look over like, what the hell's wrong with you?
551380	555284	Your response was classic.
555845	558067	You were being highly insensitive and it was hilarious.
558888	559429	Sounds like me.
560890	585204	Locopoco in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says scariest game ever Spice World see everybody's going for the what's your favorite scary movie showgirls they're going for that answer Spice World is one of the most hilarious video games ever I could tell another story about that but I won't about friends playing that game and just laughing and laughing and laughing a lot
586772	587253	Good times.
587793	590757	You know, the bus has the same technology as the TARDIS.
590838	593421	It's a lot bigger on the inside than it actually is.
594102	594923	It's a British thing.
595023	598728	It's the secrets that the British folks have figured out.
599689	601752	Who cares about physics?
602133	602774	That's fine.
603795	604516	Make it entertaining.
604936	608881	WhatUpG in our chat says, when does that new Silent Hill movie hit and should I see it?
608901	611564	I think it's the last weekend of the month, right?
612145	613326	Probably near Halloween.
613646	621456	There's the new Silent Hill game, which is on the Vita, that's been delayed forever and it's finally coming out on the 16th.
621616	623338	That's probably your next Silent Hill bit.
625239	626660	But that's pretty much it.
626800	628000	I mean, it looks good.
628480	633802	It's got, what's his name from, I don't know what the hell his name is really, from Game of Thrones.
635143	639844	There's a lot of, or I should say a lack of scary movies this year, isn't there?
639884	642605	Because usually we have a Paranormal Activity.
642645	644626	We do have a Paranormal Activity 4.
645626	647287	I haven't seen any of those movies.
647387	650948	Yeah, there's a Paranormal Activity 4, there's Insidious, which apparently is really good.
650968	652869	But there's no Saw anymore.
653129	654350	No, the Saw's done, yeah.
654390	654930	Thank God.
654950	656351	I hated those movies.
656411	660334	They had... I'm trying to think what else they had.
661615	663797	There was one... I think it already came out, though.
663817	667659	There was one that was... The Chernobyl Diaries.
667739	668340	That was one.
668420	669401	That was supposed to be alright.
670902	672062	But yeah, Paranormal Activity 4...
675285	676746	I'm trying to think what other ones there are.
676766	678988	I don't know.
679028	680429	Dark Tetsuya with the save there.
680629	682991	October 26th, if I recall correctly.
684132	686093	Black Wolf with the gaming reference.
686133	689836	Paranormal Activity 4 apparently uses the Kinect to detect ghosts now.
690357	691517	I think I read something about that.
692858	693739	Gotta keep it current.
694740	695220	Whatever.
695581	697082	It's just in a scene.
699406	699786	Let's see.
700227	705555	Shane Alinko is in our chatroom saying, the little Goomba-like enemies in Braid freak me out for no reason.
706357	711765	I guess sometimes there's certain mobs that are just really creepy looking in video games that might kind of freak you out.
711865	712206	I don't know.
713720	714801	Maybe just hits that nerve?
715901	716282	Alright.
717022	720584	Anyhow, live.vognetwork.com if you want to comment along with the show.
721205	728249	I wish DarkSakura was here so I could ask her about scary games because I know she's played her share of them, but oh well, we'll get her answer next week as we ramp up to Halloween.
728850	732912	Let's talk about video games we have been playing, what little there may be.
733092	734473	I at least have one new game to talk about.
734533	735434	I don't know what you got, Loki.
736014	736875	How was your gaming week?
737955	741278	Well, this week I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, as I normally do.
741678	747102	I was going for what I call Streak Week, which means I won every single game of the week.
747503	748483	I missed it by one.
749424	751506	I missed it by one and by three points.
751566	756990	And it was just because we were down the plane with only three people, and it was a small map, and it was just one of those games where...
757810	768375	I'd end up spawning on the opposite side of the map as the other two guys, and they'd get killed, and then they'd spawn the other side by the time I got over there, and it was just back and forth like that.
768456	770957	So unfortunately, I just wasn't able to rack up enough kills.
771317	774238	I didn't win the game prior to that by quite a bit.
774258	782022	I usually was doubling or tripling their scores, but I got 16 out of the... What was it?
782062	782703	Not even 16.
782743	783123	It was like...
785523	785983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
815643	820926	Go up to the chest and move it from the chest or your survival inventory into the chest.
821306	822927	And then you have to fill it all back up again.
822947	830891	You can't just open the chest, open the creative inventory or whatever and just drop everything in there that you want, which would be ideal.
831071	835114	Yeah, stupid ass me actually destroyed my chest and everything in it.
835214	837435	But thankfully to creative mode, I could put it all back.
838055	838536	And then some.
839376	840497	Yeah.
840797	841617	So there's that.
841797	842238	And then...
845275	858104	I kind of, well, I had, prior to Rob getting on the server, I was hustling to get the giant snowman done, because, you know, the snowman went with the snow golems that were in his house, and the mooshrooms, which my friend put in there.
858464	859585	Yeah, thanks for that, by the way.
860185	860646	Those are fun.
861426	872153	And we wanted, well, originally I was going to have... That was a scary moment in video games, by the way, when I logged into that, and then all of a sudden, and it's like, moo.
872834	874615	Cows can be kind of scary, just so you know.
875776	878179	You know, they're changing all the sound effects for those cows soon.
878619	878840	Really?
879200	882304	Yeah, the next update, they're going to have witches and bats.
882684	887249	This is a Halloween update, so witches, bats, and some other fun stuff.
887570	890973	And they're going to have witches' huts, and they're going to redo all the sound effects for things.
891434	892075	So that's kind of neat.
892395	896116	Anyway, so Minecraft, I actually did start working on a little bit.
896296	897657	What was it?
897957	903999	Hitsun's been making this kind of wild network of portals to the nether and stuff so you can walk around the map.
905100	913843	So I've been... I was dressing up one of those portals because it was near my castle, so I was going to incorporate that into the castle a little bit.
913863	918765	And I was just like, maybe I should just expand my castle a little bit more since I was kind of having fun doing that.
918965	919185	But yeah.
919825	924049	I'm going to try to stay away from making giant spheres in the game because that's a pain in the ass.
925250	926952	And I did, you know, that snowman was huge.
927272	933017	By the way, I was originally going to have it where you'd step on something and it'd shoot snowballs at you, but it got too tall.
933257	941905	So, I put arrows in it now, but it still shoots, all it does is shoot the, like, billboard, which is kind of, you know, ridiculous, but...
942105	946606	So you built something to actually shoot the ad for Orange Lounge Radio that somebody built in.
946986	950287	Well, it wasn't there when I was originally building that.
950907	951727	But they built it in there.
952127	953227	So, whatever.
953287	953788	It was funny.
955668	957408	And then, what else did I play?
960549	961529	I know there was something else.
962410	963570	Was it something on my phone?
965310	992290	Vita I downloaded the LittleBigPlanet demo so I haven't gotten a chance to check that out yet but I was going to because I charged my Vita again because I haven't been using it but I do want to pick up I may pick up LittleBigPlanet on that what else what else supposed to get Dishonored soon so I'll have that I don't know if I'm going to play it though it's one of those things I may just sell it I got Resident Evil 6 that's going
993130	995892	Yeah, I have not heard good things about Resident Evil 6.
995932	997713	There's some people that are talking about it in chat.
997753	1000855	There's a few people, I've just been kind of keeping my eye on chat.
1000896	1002517	Some people are saying it's really not that bad.
1002997	1005158	I heard something about a final boss that's kind of strange.
1005178	1006639	It looks very over the top.
1006720	1010002	See, this is something, like, I don't know who any of these characters are, because...
1011343	1013064	I don't follow the series at all.
1013404	1016287	It's just something I haven't gotten into and I don't really want to get into now.
1017648	1020210	Dishonored looks alright, so I'm kind of interested in that.
1020290	1026274	Modern Warfare, or not Modern Warfare, Black Ops 2 looks interesting, so I'll hopefully check that out once that gets around here.
1026354	1028816	A whole lot of drama with that.
1029597	1030518	Here come some of the comments.
1030678	1034240	Acidic Vampire in chat says, Red and Evil 6 is not that bad.
1035261	1037543	Which says to me, it's kind of bad, but it's not that bad.
1037683	1040125	If you're a long time fan, maybe you'll put up with it.
1041586	1044429	Let's see, someone else.
1044629	1048413	Codeman's asking a question about your Minecraft habits in another game that you've talked about before.
1049014	1052958	Codeman says, Loki, have you gotten the Minecraft sniper rifle in Borderlands 2?
1053679	1054860	It shoots Minecraft arrows.
1056385	1057126	Thanks for watching!
1073528	1079591	I haven't really bothered to try to play it yet, but it's been a while since I've been playing Borderlands.
1079951	1084594	That's one of the ones I was trying to go back and play this week, but I just didn't get a chance to.
1084634	1087495	I've been playing Minecraft because I haven't had access to the TV.
1087555	1089296	I'm waiting for it to get done with the season.
1089796	1091397	She's on season 5 right now out of 7.
1093198	1094018	When did she start?
1094038	1096099	Because that sounds like pretty fast progress to me.
1096119	1097200	Uh...
1099209	1099830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1106735	1107735	God, that show's terrible.
1108515	1109296	It's not terrible.
1109356	1117958	It's just you can totally tell when they switched up the writers because the first two seasons were all right, and then the third season, it got weird.
1118158	1120218	And then the fourth season, it got really weird.
1121139	1122759	Sounds like you've been watching a lot of it too.
1122899	1124859	I have been just because it's on TV.
1124999	1129841	And I've actually watched some of it before, but the fifth season, it's kind of back to how it was before.
1129881	1130101	It's like...
1131261	1134062	Maybe that was when the writer's strike was or something like that.
1134102	1135142	It's just really strange.
1135582	1137583	But anyways, no Medium talk here.
1138583	1139243	Too late.
1139563	1141944	Critical Myth in chat says, Medium is a terrible show.
1142064	1143004	I sympathize, Loki.
1144004	1146525	Thankfully, I've already spoiled it for my wife.
1148225	1150245	Well, she spoils all the books for me anyways.
1152606	1153627	So yeah, so that's it.
1153687	1155449	I'll probably go back and play some more Minecraft.
1155509	1156489	I've been having fun with that.
1156529	1157751	My coworkers are having fun.
1158231	1158551	I did.
1159012	1162455	I've been trying to figure out plugins that I want to put in there.
1163315	1171963	Although, see, the server that I run can run... It's basically got... It's Multicraft is the front end, and it's got a bunch of different server types you can do.
1171983	1172843	You can do a default.
1173184	1178168	You can do, like, a vanilla server, an optimized Minecraft server, then bucket...
1179509	1182511	A bucket server and a bucket beta server.
1183051	1185492	And bucket's basically a server that has plugins in it.
1185632	1189855	And so you can add different bucket plugins to the game to do different things.
1189955	1196478	So one of the things I did, which doesn't require bucket, is I enabled Raise Mini Maps, which is actually pretty awesome.
1196558	1200480	Because one of the things that, like, I'd explore the map and I'd get lost.
1200540	1204822	And I wouldn't be able to figure out where the hell my, you know, how to get back.
1205123	1207544	Other than doing a teleport, which I've been doing.
1208744	1214007	But now I have waypoints and so I know, okay, my house is in that direction.
1214147	1215548	So I know where I'm going and stuff.
1216468	1216969	So they did that.
1217069	1218649	Oh, one thing I did do in Minecraft.
1218689	1225593	I went back to the village because there's a village with actual villagers around there and their village was terrible because it spawned and
1226193	1244161	There's like doorways that they can't get to so I made them a really terrible looking pink wool house that they can go into and I spawned a bunch of villagers in there and a bunch of these iron golems to defend them against the zombies because all they were doing is like getting eaten by zombies so I had to repopulate.
1245666	1246307	So that's it.
1246947	1248049	But yeah, I'm looking for plugins.
1248089	1248989	I want to do the planes.
1249130	1255256	I want to do the planes, but that requires like Minecraft Forge, and I'm not really sure how to install that on a server that's not really mine.
1255276	1263765	Because I don't have access to the files that, you know, I think I have to ask them to upgrade, you know, us when the new Minecraft version comes out or something like that.
1263785	1264485	I think you have to do it.
1264505	1265827	I don't think they do it automatically.
1266327	1293458	so I had to figure that out and I wanted to do the planes would be awesome and maybe the guns I do want to do like a mob arena where we can just set up there's I think a bucket plugin where you set up an area and you can just have it where you fight mobs and then when you die depending on how many mobs you kill you get a reward and you don't really die in the game you don't lose anything but you just die in the arena so it would be kind of cool might set that up that's it
1293863	1297866	All right, well, I don't want to turn this into the Minecraft show, but I played a little bit of Minecraft as well.
1298626	1303549	I logged into the server and promptly got scared like hell as to all that crap that they put in my house.
1303990	1309073	And then I went outside and I saw on this VOG server they've just built everything around my house.
1309213	1315157	And I use this analogy on Bobby's show as well, but it's like you're the one holdout in the neighborhood who won't sell their house.
1315197	1318659	I'm like that old guy in Up where everything is built around the house.
1318999	1320260	and they're trying to buy your house.
1320540	1321200	So I was like, you know what?
1321260	1324322	I'm just gonna, I'm gonna bulldoze my house and go somewhere remote.
1324382	1325942	It's not like I won't ever be able to get back.
1326002	1328203	We could build an elaborate rail car unit or whatever.
1328604	1332185	So I went to an unexplored part on my map that was just due south.
1332586	1334586	I just headed south of all that stuff.
1335127	1339029	Codeman in chat says, I got lost looking for Sky's new house.
1339109	1339729	I went south.
1340189	1348313	So there's a brick house that's up on a hill that's half finished unless Bobby, I think somebody was threatening to finish it for me.
1348693	1351395	I didn't finish... I technically didn't finish this field.
1351515	1353556	All I did was just flatten it out, okay?
1353576	1354696	Well, it's a joke now.
1354857	1356237	I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do.
1356277	1357778	I'm like, I'll just flatten up this mountain.
1357818	1358739	I'm sure he won't mind.
1359459	1361260	But I started to build my little brick house.
1361320	1366063	And I like the idea of being a little bit farther away from all the action outside the city.
1366383	1367183	It's my summer home.
1367603	1367764	So...
1368684	1371846	So I was working on that a little bit, but I didn't have a whole lot of time for Minecraft.
1372486	1376448	I did play a little more World of Warcraft, because obviously the expansion is still pretty great.
1377188	1380110	I'll leave all my thoughts on that to HordeHouse.com.
1380870	1382531	I will talk about a new game, however.
1383832	1386553	The new game I want to talk about this week is... Did the stream go down?
1387153	1388294	People in chat are saying it went down.
1388354	1392016	No, I show that we're still submitting data, so I don't know what the hell's going on.
1393257	1394497	The joys of doing live radio.
1395438	1399000	And we have nothing, like, Alan's not even here tonight, so he's not playing Mass Effect or anything.
1399020	1399561	I'm not doing anything.
1399661	1403863	Jamie's, her computer's not even here because she's not here, so we've got very little data.
1404083	1405524	I'm just, yeah.
1405985	1411628	Alright, well anyway, hopefully you all get back in time to hear me talk about the one game, new game, I did play this week.
1411648	1412809	Because this is kind of important.
1414070	1414550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1431304	1437747	and it was a game from Japan that I think the actual name of it was like Tsukiban Suchaorena Wii or something like that.
1437767	1439668	Yeah, Tsukiban Suchaorena Wii.
1439688	1441589	I probably butchered that name a little bit.
1441669	1443290	Apologies to Japanese listeners.
1443731	1444931	But that was the game.
1445251	1449513	And when we were looking at pictures of the game, we were like, oh my gosh, this looks amazing.
1449554	1453796	It's like you play as this cat doing these crazy things like driving a car and doing all this stuff.
1453816	1456097	We're like, where are these games in America?
1456117	1456217	Right?
1456477	1480305	where are these new ideas where are these things we haven't seen before that are for the lols and hilarious and we uh started i think we got our listeners to tweet the people that made the game and it caught some of the game bloggers attention like we ended up being on joystick and some of the other sites because of it like you know orange launch radio took it upon themselves to make president cat happen and then there was that whole follow-up article about how
1481005	1489054	Suki Ban Sochao Renowi supposedly only sold 100 copies the week it came out, which I still claim is bullshit and somebody going for a sensationalist headline to this day.
1489074	1489715	One of those was mine.
1490656	1491016	Yeah, I know.
1491056	1491957	I'm like, Loki bought it.
1492518	1492958	But anyway...
1495980	1498922	If there is ever a time to get President Cat, it is now.
1499482	1501823	The presidential race is on.
1503223	1505204	Vote number three, President Cat.
1505364	1511447	It was 2008 because I remember there was an ad that was poking fun at the Obama Hope campaign.
1511727	1513188	So it was 2008 when all that went down.
1514128	1525371	But anyway, the point is, and why I bring that up to Tokyo Jungle, is that here is a game that's kind of that same crazy Japanese idea, but it's actually coming out here.
1526051	1538214	And the whole trick of it is that humans are gone, it's this world where the animals are basically fighting to survive, because humans are gone, but the cities are still there.
1538294	1542655	It's like the zombie apocalypse happened or something, but animals are still alive.
1543155	1548359	You get to unfold part about what happened as you play more and more of the game.
1549039	1552741	But you basically select what animal you want to play the game as.
1552882	1553922	And you start with two.
1554022	1556364	You start with one carnivore and one herbivore.
1556684	1560927	And you can play as a little Pomeranian dog, is the carnivore that you start as.
1561347	1562808	Or you can play as some type of deer.
1563088	1567271	Like a silka deer, I think it's called, or something, is the herbivore that you can start with.
1568712	1569112	Oh, thank you.
1569152	1570413	OffCanonogram says it was October 22, 2009.
1570473	1571374	I guess it wasn't that long ago.
1574138	1579912	and TigerClaw says the premise of Tokyo Jungle is similar to that show on the Discovery Channel called Life After People.
1581038	1582279	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1609358	1612479	and you have to stay out of toxic dumps that could be in the city.
1612840	1614440	You have to stay away from all these things.
1614941	1617622	So you have all these meters that are constantly draining.
1617642	1619643	You have to stay on top of and make sure are full.
1620043	1621944	And then you're trying to complete all these micro goals.
1622204	1625325	So maybe it's eating and then it's marking your territory.
1625705	1627486	Yes, you get to mark your territory in the game.
1627926	1633649	And then it's finding a female to mate with and then actually mating with the female.
1634449	1651253	Oh my god, Loki, I died laughing the first time that scene happened because you play us as little Pomeranian and we found the little female Pomeranian and went to the little nest and it goes all the way up to the dog getting up on his hind legs mounting the female Pomeranian before it fades to black.
1651913	1655836	So there's no thrust, but there's definitely the assume the position.
1655876	1657237	And I was dying.
1657997	1658898	So that was great.
1659498	1661819	And that made me laugh a lot.
1662080	1665302	And then you basically, you'll start the next generation.
1665762	1671546	So in the next generation, you get stats passed down to you based on how you did in the first generation.
1671946	1679571	So the key to maxing out your stats is to continue to mate and get all these stats from having played the game.
1680814	1681655	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1707853	1709614	When you're dead, game over.
1710115	1711276	It's all over.
1712697	1714958	So that's like Dark Souls level of unforgiving.
1715419	1716960	Which is kind of awesome, I have to say.
1717020	1718881	It kind of ramps the pressure up a little bit.
1720908	1746402	but I will say this, there is a way you can get more than one life and it is if you breed and you happen to have like four children you'll run around as a little pack and if one of you dies then another can take over but because you're running around in a pack one of your pack might have to be a decoy and take the hit so you don't take the hit so there's all this crap going on that you kind of have to manage I have to say, it's pretty damn fun
1747663	1751944	and you don't really see games like this that are out in America.
1752405	1753705	Now, is it a perfect game?
1754025	1754285	No.
1754845	1756226	Sometimes it can get a little frustrating.
1756306	1757926	Sometimes it feels a little grindy.
1758546	1773791	I was really irritated with the way that you can only save after you breed because it might take you a good 15 minutes to get from one life cycle to another and sometimes I have to quit and save right now and if I don't save properly, my game's gone, basically.
1773931	1775572	You can't do anything about that.
1776332	1776993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1791610	1791930	DarkSakura.com
1807918	1829567	for $12 it's pretty hard to not appreciate that value there's about like I think something like 30 different animals you can play as and then of course there's DLC if you want to play as more animals but there's crazy shit like panda bears and you know there's all this like funny stuff they even had in Japan they actually had it where one of the creatures you get was a salaryman
1829884	1832029	Yeah, I think that happens later on.
1832129	1838645	SSJ100Matt in our chat says, at live.vognetwork.com, a game where I can pee and have sex with everything?
1838785	1839206	Sold!
1841059	1868159	uh let's see uh Actdeft says it's Mass Effect with animals not quite because there's really no dialogue and that's kind of the big part about uh Mass Effect um Tigerclaw says when you play as the lions you have to protect the pride pride from rogue lions that are trying to take over yeah that's I mean even when you play as the Pomeranian a beagle might take your ass out in 30 seconds that's how I got killed the first time I'm running around doing my thing and then all of a sudden like a beagle jumps out of nowhere and attacks me and kills me game over
1870222	1871443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1895681	1896081	It's neat.
1896502	1898664	It'll probably be on sale even more in a few months.
1898924	1901067	The weird thing is, nobody's really talking about this game.
1901107	1902568	I tried to look up reviews online.
1902869	1904170	I found like three reviews.
1904671	1907214	One great, one average, one negative.
1908295	1910377	So this game is very polarizing, I gotta say.
1911258	1933319	but like none of the big sites reviewed it at all and I've hardly read anything about it anywhere so it really sucks that like Sony's like trying this experiment and it might fail due to lack of promotion so I'm just saying everybody I'll use what little podcast we have here if you think you might be interested in this type of game go check out Tokyo Jungle because it's a neat little little gem on the PlayStation Network
1934636	1935557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1963195	1964076	Thank you for watching!
1979958	1983200	Their audio is really good, so I was really happy to take on these microphones.
1983560	1984901	So I really want to thank them.
1985482	1990985	They are on Monday nights at the Voice of Geeks Network at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, and they have done a lot.
1991406	1994688	Brad from PodCulture has done a lot and is very supportive of the projects I've done.
1994988	1996649	He hosts the website for Horde House.
1996969	2003954	He did those decals, or I don't think he did them himself, but he arranged the deal for those decals for Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.
2003994	2007376	So I'm really thankful for all Brad does for the show, so I really want to thank him.
2008036	2008596	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2036764	2044872	Speaking of pod culture and all of the Monday night shows on the Voice of Geeks Network, it is Doctor Who Monday on the Voice of Geeks Network tomorrow.
2045272	2053301	Three shows all talking about Doctor Who, Critical Myth, British Invaders, and pod culture's special TARDIS Interruptus.
2053621	2055842	Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who Doctor Who
2075809	2082414	So I know Critical Myth and Pod Culture, TARDIS Interruptus, both want to kind of take that on a little bit.
2083334	2094903	British Invaders, which is sandwiched right between the two shows, back-to-back shows on the Voice Geek Networks tomorrow, taking on classic Doctor Who before the Russell T. Davies era, going back to the 60s and 70s.
2095183	2097684	So it's a really nice mix of the new and the old tomorrow on VOG.
2097985	2098625	And that's what I love.
2098665	2102588	I love that that's what this network's all about, is that everybody's got a common theme going on.
2103148	2103949	So, very cool.
2104649	2105390	That's tomorrow night.
2105710	2114454	Starts at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern with Critical Myth, 5 Pacific, 8 Eastern with British Invaders, 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern with PodCulture.
2114794	2122718	And even if you missed Doctor Who night because you're listening on the podcast feed or what have you, do check out these excellent shows another time on the network another Monday.
2122998	2124459	And they do rerun throughout the week as well.
2126126	2128108	Also want to plug Umlaut.
2128789	2130010	It is Umlaut season.
2130070	2130670	Can you believe it?
2130851	2134054	Umlaut is the rock band event for charity.
2134094	2140439	It takes place at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco every December and the fundraising season is in effect for this year.
2140699	2142161	They still need a couple more bands.
2142601	2146625	Very surprising they didn't sell out as fast as they did last year because...
2147105	2148166	and Tim Schafer.
2162498	2163198	Thanks for watching!
2190251	2203823	December 6th, 2012 is the official date at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco Thursday and I bet it's going to be streamed on the internet again just a bet because it was last year so I bet they're going to do it again
2205544	2233133	uh one other thing it's a plug i got a lot tonight what can i say uh it is also awards season in the podcast universe podcast awards and stitcher awards two of them this year uh you can nominate for the podcast award one time at podcastawards.com and we really encourage you to nominate orange lounge radio as your best gaming show uh we would also really encourage you to consider other VOG programming and other independent programming in the other categories
2233493	2247698	For example, TV Movie, there's Critical Myth is a great TV movie show, Sci-Fi, Pod Culture, Mature, Under Station Live, and lots of great, great shows on the network to consider for some of these categories.

2308940	2310181	Okay, now we can get into gaming news.
2310401	2311502	Sorry, a lot of announcements tonight.
2311522	2311942	What can I say?
2312882	2313242	All right.
2314303	2314663	Let's see.
2314723	2320326	Let's talk a little bit about Cliffy B. He is gone.
2321067	2322448	He decided to leave Epic Games.
2323288	2326310	And, you know, basically, it makes sense.
2326770	2329291	He's been doing it since he's been a teenager.
2329432	2333534	And he said, outside of my sabbatical last year, I've been going nonstop.
2334314	2361421	and you know grew up in this business as um you know he says as Mike Capps likes to say and now that I'm growing up it's much or it's time for a much-needed break so cool I'm not sure who else is going to be kind of taking over for some of that stuff now that he's gone but um it's cool to see him kind of get his break because he's definitely been busy with Gears of War
2363440	2370523	Um, I've heard a lot of rumors and this is total fanboy wank, but I want to indulge it a little bit at just how wanky this all is.
2370583	2371924	You know which rumor this is, right?
2372004	2375165	Like where he went or where he's going, who offered to buy him.
2375565	2376126	Have you heard this?
2376466	2376626	No.
2377834	2385119	What would be the craziest fanboy company that people hope hired Cliffy B to show how serious they are?
2389482	2390022	Zynga?
2390303	2391043	No, no.
2391924	2392584	Nintendo.
2393225	2400149	There are rumors online that Cliffy B went to Nintendo, which I... You know, obvious fanboy wank.
2400229	2401670	I don't want to indulge it too much.
2402071	2404072	But you can't help yourself.
2404212	2406334	Once the seed is planted in your head, you're like...
2407034	2409716	God, Nintendo really should hire someone like him.
2410336	2411117	It doesn't matter.
2411237	2414959	I don't think it matters, because... I don't know.
2415259	2418722	It's just... I don't know what he would be able to do for them.
2420683	2423985	Hopefully make another franchise, because seriously, they need some new franchises.
2424045	2426106	Invent a hardcore franchise?
2426587	2430169	Maybe with some of the Japanese characterization?
2430209	2430449	I don't know.
2430469	2431310	Maybe I'm crazy, but...
2433717	2437819	They've had hardcore franchises at one point, I thought.
2438879	2439340	I don't know.
2439880	2440820	Sin and Punishment?
2441640	2443701	Yeah, Sin and Punishment is pretty awesome.
2443801	2445702	I mean, there's that.
2445822	2448663	There's Eternal Darkness.
2450784	2453125	But none of that on the Wii U. None of it.
2455125	2458567	Actdeft says Cliffy B did get a letter printed in Nintendo Power.
2460607	2464128	So, you know, apparently a lot of people leeching onto that, like, oh, he's always loved Nintendo.
2464148	2465009	He'd go work for them.
2467569	2467930	Cool.
2468150	2477873	I mean, I don't know if the reason he's quitting Epic Games was because he feels like he needs a break.
2477913	2480274	I don't know if he's going to jump right into something else right now.
2481664	2484886	Unless he's just making excuses, which is kind of a pussy way of doing it.
2485607	2492351	Well, but there's also kind of the right corporate way of doing things, and maybe he's going to take a siesta for a few months until the next E3.
2492431	2494112	I'm leaving because Nintendo said they'll hire me.
2494212	2494713	Sweet!
2495933	2500296	Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Cliffy being a Nintendo is a real stretch.
2500416	2502358	I wouldn't be surprised if he went to Microsoft, though.
2504879	2507301	That's a little more like, okay, realistic category.
2507421	2508482	Or Sony.
2509322	2510323	I could see that happening, too.
2512392	2512853	Who knows?
2512973	2513754	Anything's possible.
2513834	2514474	Anything's possible.
2514494	2515275	It's a crazy world.
2515676	2516436	It's a crazy world.
2517357	2519059	Seg asked a challenging question, though.
2519440	2521902	How would he benefit from going to Nintendo?
2522763	2525726	Maybe they offered him houses full of money.
2526067	2528369	I mean, Cliffy B is kind of a rock star.
2528389	2529470	We've given you a Nintendo DS.
2531372	2532173	It prints money.
2534149	2537272	Again, I don't want to buy into the fanboy wank too much.
2537332	2539154	I'm not saying I personally believe it.
2539775	2547182	I can definitely see the angle of, shit, you've been doing one thing for 20 years, and maybe you just want to change.
2547322	2548663	He's going to go design playgrounds.
2549964	2552767	Just playgrounds with chainsaws attached to them, that kind of thing.
2552887	2558631	But the interesting thing is, the guys at BioWare, the doctors at BioWare, did a very similar thing recently.
2558871	2561353	They left the industry after a very long time.
2561493	2563234	I kind of don't think they're going to show up anywhere else.
2563254	2564996	Oh my god, you know what's going on.
2565776	2571160	They're going to make a game company that's like... Polytron?
2571360	2579025	Oh, you think all these game journalists that left are going to create the League of Super Game Designers and make this company that'll create like...
2580226	2580627	Something.
2580687	2584831	Which, yeah, there's that Polygon, which did they ever like officially launch?
2584851	2585491	Who gives a fuck?
2585571	2586893	I seriously don't care.
2587373	2590256	It is like the most hipster bullshit, you know, company.
2590636	2591257	Wow.
2591457	2592818	Hey, we're so cool.
2592878	2600426	We're going to print articles about, we're going to do a documentary about the creation of our company, our website that's not fucking finished yet.
2600806	2603549	No one cares about your fucking website.
2605607	2611372	That, I mean, how fucking, you know, snub-nosed, you know, pompous bullshit is that?
2611412	2612432	I mean, that you're just gonna...
2613789	2638556	create a documentary because you know you all want to know how this happened no one fucking cares are you saying now I you know the views and opinions of Loki do not express those Orange Lounge Radio necessarily so what you're saying is you're really interested in that but but yeah I'm gonna say I'm not gonna touch that with a 10-foot pole are you saying that this site has lost itself up its own asshole before it's even launched yes
2639957	2640717	Just checking.
2641138	2645361	I mean, SSJ100Mad is asking, do they print out game ads in Whole Foods and Trader Joe's?
2645681	2647423	Look, I don't want this to be a shade-throwing competition.
2647463	2649064	Look, we're going to walk away from this.
2650445	2655128	But let's talk about the whole idea of the Super Justice League of game developers.
2655549	2660593	So you think maybe Cliffy B, BioWare, you know Zynga lost some people this week too.
2661513	2665396	Do you think it could be like the Super League of Mobile Phone Developers?
2666918	2667098	Maybe.
2667118	2667278	Maybe.
2668749	2669790	What if he went to Apple?
2670891	2671451	Oh, God.
2674894	2675855	You never know.
2675975	2678738	He would be a pretty cool, like, presenter.
2678938	2684022	I mean, because, you know, they need something kind of, you know, with a lot of... Are you saying Tim Cook doesn't have enough energy?
2684443	2684943	No, he doesn't.
2688266	2688586	All right.
2689687	2694552	Anyhow, all right, so Cliffy B's leaving, and so we dedicate this to you, Cliffy B.
2708850	2710183	Thank you.
2712389	2713470	Let's move on to something.
2713530	2718652	We've gone from a very American company to something very Japanese, but a lot of you love it.
2718712	2721333	It's Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix.
2722114	2723675	You're rolling your eyes over there, Loki.
2723695	2725015	I'm rolling my eyes at the name.
2725175	2727657	I mean, seriously, just come up with a better fucking name.
2727917	2728617	1.5 HD Remix.
2729898	2730258	How's it 1.5?
2730618	2733980	I'm going to tell you.
2734520	2735921	I'm so glad you asked, Loki.
2736281	2738702	Here is how Kingdom Hearts 1 is now Kingdom Hearts 1.5.
2738762	2738982	You ready?
2739002	2739082	Yeah.
2740723	2747248	The screen for each game will rearrange to accommodate for widescreen support including the HUD rearrangement.
2749210	2749730	No reaction.
2750311	2758017	The models for Sora and all his friends have been replaced with ones from Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance, the newest game in the series.
2759594	2759854	Nothing.
2759894	2760154	All right.
2760715	2765438	Trophy support for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.
2766679	2766819	No?
2767039	2767320	Nothing?
2768220	2769261	I thought you were an achievement whore.
2770081	2770702	No, I'm not.
2771603	2775806	Game mechanics have been updated to make the gameplay feel more like Kingdom Hearts 2.
2776566	2780149	Now, in all reality, that could be a good thing if they fix the camera from the first game.
2780209	2785512	I'm hoping that's the hidden message in there without them wanting to admit that the first game had a board camera.
2786373	2788555	You have to admit, that's a little better, right?
2788575	2789155	Yeah.
2789315	2790736	It's a nice addition, I guess.
2790756	2791456	Alright, there you go.
2791536	2792077	We got something.
2793777	2801301	70% of the story from 358 slash 2 days will be represented with over 100 new scenes created with full voice acting.
2803322	2804243	Oh my gosh!
2804563	2807305	Was that an admission from Loki that there might be something worthwhile here?
2807325	2812527	Well, it's all cutscenes from another game because they didn't want to actually port over 358 slash 2 or whatever.
2814068	2828502	Well, I'm so glad you said something about that because Tetsuya Nomura said he originally wanted to do a full remake of the 358 slash two days, but he didn't have enough time in production to start a project, thus the decision to utilize theater mode to tell the story.
2829103	2829703	That's kind of lame.
2830444	2831065	Ran out of time?
2831823	2832303	That's lame.
2832323	2833604	That's an excuse.
2833824	2835565	It's just easier to update everything.
2836486	2842389	Now, he was asked in this interview with Famitsu, would Kingdom Hearts 2 get the same treatment?
2842969	2847832	And the response was a laugh and, quote, it'd be unusual if there wasn't.
2848732	2850693	Because we've already decided that we're doing that.
2852094	2855437	Well, I bet a lot of it is how well does this first one sell?
2855697	2859420	If this one sells like crazy, then sure, that's a logical conclusion to get to.
2859440	2863523	Well, then they'll do the PSP games on top of it for the next one.
2863583	2864023	The Vita?
2864564	2864944	Well, no.
2865324	2876193	No, they'll do the PSP games up-res because just like they did with... Remember, Sony is already on the record saying that they've got a wonderful engine that can port PSP stuff into HD for the PS3, so why not?
2878654	2907170	another quote along the same lines of this whole does this mean there's a 2.5 quote and from Tetsuya Nomura quote I figured there were people who had a hard time keeping up with the sequels we had to start from the beginning with Kingdom Hearts HD I also thought that familiar fans might make new discoveries seeing everything in chronological order with the sequels side by side I'm happy to be restarting this title I don't think it's a problem that people necessarily have problems keeping up with the sequels it's that people can't keep up with the fucking story like
2908311	2911094	Isn't Kingdom Hearts supposed to be aimed at kids?
2912415	2915218	The story is crazy convoluted.
2915358	2916620	I can't even understand it.
2917160	2919322	It's worse than As the World Turns.
2921164	2921945	It's crazy.
2925489	2929513	Frisbee in chat asks, how can you remake something that isn't that old?
2930987	2933670	Well, it's getting there, though.
2933710	2938016	By the time this is actually out, 2013 would be about the time frame this is out, right?
2938356	2942241	The first Kingdom Hearts game was, what, 2003, maybe?
2942482	2943122	About 10 years?
2944424	2944905	9 years, maybe?
2945926	2947127	They remade God of War.
2947908	2949611	Or rolled up Resident.
2953355	2957601	Techness in chat says Square Enix is kind of like the honey badger of Japanese developers.
2957641	2960364	They just don't give a fuck and just do whatever they feel like doing today.
2961326	2965051	Alan Alchemy says you can't argue you have no fucking idea what's going on anymore.
2965111	2965932	Here comes a sequel.
2967313	2987984	I think it's a good idea to have these re-releases because it's most likely ramping up to a Kingdom Hearts 3 or something like that so they're going to put these re-releases out there so people kind of have an idea what the fuck's going on let the hype train begin and get back into it and then go from there well we will see what happens I love this other comment from Alan Alchemy P.S.
2988064	2993147	we made figuring out what the fuck was going on very very hard we know haters make us famous
2995197	2995778	Absolutely.
2996138	2997079	Haters make us famous.
2997799	2998400	Let's move on.
2999461	2999741	All right.
3000182	3004906	So there's a new service that's going to be coming out from Microsoft, Xbox Music.
3005026	3013033	It's supposed to be coming this month and actually launching, I guess, alongside Windows 8, which I'm surprised that so soon.
3013093	3014475	It's October 26th.
3016056	3016717	Who cares about Windows 8?
3016857	3017577	Go see Silent Hill.
3019119	3019799	And then, of course...
3021741	3023822	It sounds very similar to Pandora.
3025063	3033147	Basically, it's going to be ad-supported, and you'll be able to also use Windows 8, Xbox 360, Windows Phone.
3034027	3042952	It's going to tie into Microsoft SkyDrive, and I guess allow you to sync your playlists and music libraries across all the devices and stuff.
3043993	3044133	And...
3046744	3047084	I don't know.
3047944	3048145	Neat.
3048345	3052906	I mean, I'm glad it's free because, you know, I don't want to have to pay for stuff.
3053246	3054127	Ad support is fine.
3055067	3065291	Free is good, but I think, you know, because you're talking about Pandora and there's all these other services Xbox already offers that Xbox Music has to be better than that are also free.
3065351	3071253	Last.fm is available on the 360. iHeartRadio, which is kind of Clear Channel's little Pandora-esque theme.
3071793	3074714	But you can actually listen to over-the-air radio stations with it too.
3075154	3076435	That's on Xbox 360.
3076875	3080177	So I think it's logical that they have to kind of put something out free.
3080257	3085719	The subscription model for music isn't really working anymore, which is why I think Apple never ended up doing it.
3087099	3087300	Yet.
3087420	3091721	Although maybe Apple can kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies can't.
3091841	3094683	So there you go.
3096408	3098009	So you'll check out Xbox Music.
3098349	3100111	I keep forgetting there is a dashboard update.
3100391	3101331	We're due for one, aren't we?
3101952	3103173	Probably either at the end.
3103293	3104634	I'm going to guess at the end of this month.
3105974	3112259	Get it out there so that they can start banning people before Modern Warfare, or not Modern Warfare.
3112419	3113780	I keep wanting to call it Modern Warfare 3.
3113840	3116021	No, Black Ops 2 comes out.
3116241	3116762	Halo 4.
3117602	3121265	They want to get those extra security checks in there before all those big games.
3121285	3121845	That's a good point.
3121885	3123166	When is Halo 4's release?
3123406	3127869	Halo 4 is the 6th and Black Ops 2 is the 13th of November.
3128069	3128449	November.
3128689	3128849	Yeah.
3129210	3129870	I guess that makes sense.
3129910	3133672	We are in October now, so it'll be like just before Halo 4 maybe.
3133692	3134773	Lots of games.
3135213	3135513	Yep.
3135814	3137275	We'll get to the release date soon enough.
3138235	3140276	Well, something else on the Xbox 360.
3140436	3145439	One company is claiming that they are going to be soon heard on the Xbox 360 and seen.
3146040	3147701	It's the site YouPorn.
3148261	3149482	Never heard of this site.
3149782	3150362	Can you believe that?
3150382	3151723	A pornography site I haven't heard of.
3151803	3152083	It's YouPorn.
3152103	3152824	I've heard of it.
3153244	3153684	Oh, really?
3153924	3156365	I have the app on my boxy box.
3158265	3160286	So you can see some boxy box on your boxy box?
3161106	3162686	Except they don't ever use it because it's terrible.
3165127	3167348	But yeah, it's one of the... I mean, come on.
3167648	3172669	The boxy box had all these different repositories that you can get and a lot of them were porn.
3172729	3177390	So I had to download all the porn ones that were free because I'm not paying for fucking porn.
3178270	3179511	Not doing it.
3179911	3180091	But...
3181331	3181932	Yeah, we checked it out.
3181992	3183233	It's just links to their website.
3183813	3185614	It looks exactly the same as the other ones.
3185714	3188156	It's a streaming website for porn.
3188436	3193219	Of course, the name implies the YouTube of porn, sort of.
3194080	3196121	Well, they posted an entry to their blog.
3196141	3197682	Let's see.
3198502	3199103	Oh my gosh.
3199143	3200364	Wait, I've got to read this from chat.
3200464	3202105	Alpha Cananagram in our chat room.
3202825	3207950	at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob, I remember y'all talking about you porn on Guys on a Show.
3208411	3213035	I'm pretty sure that was the site y'all went to for, quote, Japanese fart girl.
3214451	3215912	How do you remember that?
3216172	3217092	That's amazing.
3217192	3220133	You remember things about my life I don't remember.
3220453	3226816	And YouPorn was also the website that we visited on your Wii using the Wii web browser to find pterodactyl porn.
3226836	3228016	I thought that was PornTube.
3228657	3229757	They're all the fucking same.
3229917	3230397	I don't know.
3231218	3232098	It was one of those.
3232758	3233138	All right.
3233539	3236800	Well, anyhow, here's the quote from YouPorn's blog.
3237600	3240461	Gamers and free porn lovers around the world rejoice.
3240802	3241282	Yay.
3242162	3245643	Thanks at long last to the introduction of Internet Explorer for Xbox.
3245963	3251165	You can now tap into and stream all your favorite free YouPorn videos right from your Xbox.
3251665	3265289	Whether you're pwning noobs in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, annihilating Bullymong in Borderlands 2, or taking the Saints deep in Madam NFL 13, you're never more than a few simple controller clicks away from being face deep in hot free porn.
3268210	3271051	Yes, because we all have the internet, so it's no big deal.
3272267	3272667	Yay!
3273027	3277429	So all they're really saying is, we can't wait for Internet Explorer on the Xbox 360.
3277469	3280069	Who says it's going to fucking work with your website anyways?
3280109	3281850	Because it's Internet Explorer!
3281930	3285211	I mean, it's like, that's not guaranteed to work with anything.
3285991	3289012	I mean, I would hope that's HTML5, but I mean, come on.
3289812	3292393	We know better than, you know, all these...
3293934	3297758	You know, different web browsers for stuff don't necessarily work with the porn sites.
3297798	3300501	Now, granted, the PlayStation 3 browser works well with porn sites.
3300882	3302443	The Wii browser works well with porn sites.
3302483	3305487	So, it is... They kind of have to at this point.
3306187	3306488	But, yes.
3306948	3310011	And with that news, though, VOG Network is also on your Xbox 360 because...
3311713	3313914	It's HTML5, so it should work.
3314254	3317375	Assuming that Internet Explorer 8 works with HTML5.
3317395	3320936	Are you going to be able to code a website to show up like an Xbox channel?
3321216	3322717	Or not 8, 10.
3323877	3325657	Maybe, I don't know about that.
3325677	3328338	Because we should make a VOG channel if that's possible.
3328398	3328758	But anyway.
3329059	3330939	I don't think it works that way.
3331079	3333600	That'll happen as soon as the new OLR PSP debuts.
3335453	3337216	Yeah, except the PSP's over.
3338578	3342624	Oh, Bobby in chat says it does not stream on the Xbox 360 Internet Explorer.
3342725	3343285	I tried.
3343566	3345809	I guess he's in some developer thing.
3345849	3348353	He has the XNA thing, so yeah.
3349115	3349976	We need to make it work.
3351597	3357082	The official response from Microsoft, who are quick to distance themselves from this.
3358062	3367590	To be clear, we are adding Internet Explorer to Xbox Live, not specific adult content providers like YouPorn or any other specific website content.
3368050	3373475	Additionally, we give members and parents the option to turn this feature on or off for their accounts.
3374035	3378238	Access to Internet Explorer for all child accounts is blocked by default.
3379219	3383783	They want to get far away from a scandal ASAP And who can blame them?
3384504	3402499	Because honestly, you know, if Fox News got a hold of this little spiel here Oh, they've done it with every single console that has a stupid web browser Exactly, and they'd have a It's a porn box, oh, Xbox, triple Xbox I think they've already done that before They'd have a pornography expert on with commentating, you know, whatever
3402930	3409796	I think they've already done that too before with the Windows Media Center streaming or something like that.
3409816	3417383	Because you used to build these Windows Media Center to view what's on your computer and stream Internet Explorer or Firefox or something like that.
3418564	3426590	Good lord, Jason in chat says, not to beat a dead horse, but Rob mentioned you porn in an unprotected six, too, I thought, referencing my old, old YouTube project.
3426710	3426950	What?
3427790	3432093	I swear I have not heard of you porn, although I'm old and I forget things, so whatever.
3433074	3438558	Some folks in chat, I think, kind of wondering if maybe the Kinect would allow you to make your own porn and you could upload it.
3438638	3439979	I don't think Internet Explorer will allow you to do that.
3439999	3440519	That would look terrible.
3440679	3441780	That camera is not good.
3444620	3456120	all right Frisbee in chat says I'm an internet expert and I just found out that boobies are online maybe I'm doing the show topless right now
3457897	3458939	Alright, Loki.
3461582	3463344	Seriously, porn, porn, porn.
3463764	3465366	The internet is for porn.
3465386	3466007	I mean, come on.
3466227	3467809	The internet is for porn.
3469150	3473876	So, apparently there are cheating allegations in the League of Legends...
3475097	3476398	Playoffs.
3476418	3481220	First you tell me there's boobs on the internet and now you're going to tell me there's cheating?
3481400	3481900	I know!
3482100	3483561	Get the fuck out!
3483821	3487723	Well, here's the most ridiculous part of the whole thing is that
3489366	3490327	Thank you for watching!
3507644	3513871	Basically, one of the referees said, we keep a constant watch on all the players on stage at all times.
3514272	3518497	We have cameras as well as live people walking on stage to keep tabs on everything.
3518577	3524864	All players are told that they need to remain sitting facing forward with headphones on at all times, including during pauses.
3525945	3533817	I can confirm that no WE player looked at the minimap at any point during the match.
3534878	3537182	Although they have a screenshot showing otherwise.
3537462	3537622	So...
3539730	3540050	I don't know.
3541331	3543473	But here's my thing.
3543493	3557122	It's like if you're going to set up a tournament like that, and I didn't watch it live, so I don't know how exactly they're set up, but wouldn't you think that you would put the players in a way that they wouldn't be able to see the mini-map showing the other team?
3557702	3558403	Just a thought?
3558743	3569090	Maybe so that they can't look at the other team's screen, or they can't look at something that's being broadcast on a giant screen in an arena, wherever the fuck this is.
3570130	3575396	So, don't give them the opportunity, then you don't have to worry about them fucking, you know, cheating.
3575616	3580180	Little mirrors on the side of my glasses allow me to see behind me and around me.
3580781	3581902	I mean, seriously, it's just...
3584079	3613304	it's stupid but it's for two million dollars so of course some people are going to try to you know whatever they can do and and there was um you know they were talking a little bit about you know what kind of made them suspect stuff like uh ended up where one team was I guess pinging a spot in the map or whatever where um the other team was and basically there was no way for them to have known that those guys were there but they knew that the players were coming from that direction or something like that so it's like wait a second that's a little weird
3613444	3619108	Well, what if it's just that, you know, maybe you kind of read up on the competition and maybe you know their strategies and stuff.
3619128	3627573	Like, I know those might be kind of a stretch here, but what if, you know, they just kind of, you know, that's where they wanted to investigate and it was just a coincidence.
3628274	3629675	I mean, maybe I'm giving it too much credit.
3629915	3631356	I'll be honest, but I don't know.
3632036	3632857	It could happen.
3632877	3634958	I think you have to look at both sides.
3635438	3637980	You don't want to just automatically assume everybody's a cheater.
3638120	3639321	Yeah, because here's one of the comments.
3639441	3651848	They said Azubu Frost did the same thing, only they paused the game, checked the map, and saw that the enemy team was going to ambush them, trying to counter the tactic that Azubu used in the past.
3651948	3661373	With the pause, Azubu managed to mysteriously ping the exact brush TSM was in at the same time they were there, just after the pause.
3661514	3662154	Coincidentally.
3662214	3665536	So, I mean, it sounds like that they were
3667273	3669675	I don't know, a little funny business is going on.
3670275	3670755	Very interesting.
3670775	3677760	But once again, you know, okay, apparently what it was is the map was being projected behind the players, you know, so people can see it.
3677960	3685525	But put a fucking screen or something, you know, put that in a projection screen that's in front of the team.
3685545	3688207	Oh yeah, because you can maybe see the reflection in the monitor or something.
3688227	3689408	It would be very easy.
3691069	3696533	It just, come on, you're running a $2 million tournament and you can't have decent, you're going to go that,
3698274	3725087	you know that ghetto cheap on that stuff to where oh well you know people even in regular tournaments that run well people are going to accuse other people of cheating just don't give them the opportunity especially when this much money is on the line sometimes you don't think of everything I don't know on Horde House this week we talked about a guild Warcraft contest that went a little wrong because you know they didn't think about every possible thing that could happen
3726916	3737890	not to mention that they also I think there was an issue where someone was DOSing the servers they were trying to use for oh great for something so they moved to like some different servers or something I don't know
3740123	3741204	All right, well, let's move on.
3741404	3742544	Something completely different.
3742924	3745705	Something you can play with online to make your own chiptune music.
3745785	3760209	I like little creative sites like this, and this is pretty cool because this website kind of looks like a Game Boy, and you can sequence your own tones, play them back, and save things to a WAV file so you can make your own cool little chiptunes.
3760649	3762150	It is called Pulse Boy.
3762230	3766631	If you want to check it out, it's pulseboy.com, and I think it's called that because it looks like a Game Boy.
3767171	3768632	It was made by Roger Hicks.
3769292	3775304	So if you feel like kind of just messing around making your own chip, excuse me, your own chiptune songs, you can check out that website.
3776727	3778889	I don't know what else to say about it, but it looks pretty cool.
3778929	3786274	I haven't had time to play with it myself yet, but I like those music-making types of programs, especially since there hasn't been a new Mario Paint.
3787035	3787855	That is a crime.
3787875	3788356	That is a crime.
3788376	3791518	They need to have that with a tablet controller.
3791598	3792019	I know, right?
3792039	3792659	Come on.
3792679	3794841	Still no Mario Paint, but now they have Art Academy.
3795141	3795581	That's why.
3795661	3796522	It's Art Academy now.
3797263	3797943	Who cares?
3798964	3799724	Mario Paint.
3800465	3801506	I don't want Art Academy.
3801526	3802426	I want Mario Paint.
3802607	3804288	Besides, there's GarageBand.
3806305	3806865	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3831448	3835130	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that are coming out soon near you.
3835550	3838652	This week is actually quite a bit because we're getting into the fall stuff.
3839052	3845676	And, of course, today, Pokemon Black Version 2 and Pokemon White Version 2 out on the Nintendo DS.
3846496	3852739	Naughty Bear Double Trouble for the PlayStation 3 includes a Naughty Bear Gold Edition and Naughty Bear Trouble in Paradise.
3853700	3855201	Both, I'm sure, very underwhelming.
3855461	3857482	Oh, I love Naughty Bear, said nobody ever.
3859045	3859926	Yeah, pretty much.
3860347	3861087	We played the original.
3861147	3861868	It was terrible.
3863290	3866073	Spy Hunters coming back on the Vita and 3DS.
3866934	3871239	Just Dance 4 out this week on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii.
3871959	3873821	Dragon Ball Z for Kinect.
3874362	3875724	So now you can be over 9,000.
3878026	3879408	Code of Princess for the 3DS.
3881167	3893575	Also, Harry Potter for Kinect, Monster 4x4 for the 3DS, the cool game this week, Dishonored on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3894636	3900379	And, let's see, XCOM, Enemy Unknown on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3900599	3904422	I can't believe that series is coming back, and it's probably going to look nothing like the original.
3906064	3920880	the new one well this is the strategy one so they don't have the third person shooter one yet and then Fable the Journey on Xbox 360 for Kinect and god I wonder if that sucks or not haven't seen any reviews for that yet but that's it
3921821	3925204	Alright, well traveling to Japan, some of the same stuff on the Xbox 360 over there.
3925304	3929848	Dishonored comes out on the 360 October 11th, as well as Fable the Journey.
3930508	3936273	Something must be going on with Rocksmith because there's a new cable and a cable bundle that are coming out in Japan as well.
3937073	3939215	So Rocksmith must be landing in Japan.
3939775	3941657	Either it already has or it's landing there soon.
3942437	3943238	on the PlayStation 3.
3944299	3946641	Pretty much all the same stuff I just named.
3946962	3948964	Oh no, just Dishonored and the Rocksmith thing.
3949024	3950205	The other one isn't happening.
3950525	3956451	But they also have Toki Toa comes out as well in a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack.
3956971	3957612	Kind of interesting.
3958493	3959634	Anyhow, I don't know what this is.
3959674	3965019	This is some type of like... A wedding is supposed to be a joyous occasion for Princess Toki and her knight.
3965099	3968302	However, the sneaky witch predicts that somebody is going to die at her wedding.
3968662	3969884	Well, that's kind of a downer, isn't it?
3970945	3973207	You have to... God, this is kind of fucked up.
3973667	3975628	Sounds like it could be kind of a neat concept, actually.
3993010	3996594	On the PlayStation Vita, nothing this week, but you do have FIFA 13 to look forward to on the 18th.
4016734	4018875	and going to the 3DS real quick.
4019675	4021216	There's a few things, quite a few things.
4021556	4027058	Project X Zone, a Nintendo 3DS LL in blue and black, which I believe is the XL.
4027758	4031400	Bravely Default Flying Fairy from Square Enix.
4032400	4034122	No idea what that could be, but there you go.
4034702	4036724	And game of the week for many people, I'm sure.
4037224	4045010	Hello Kitty, Toeiso, Block Crash Z. That means like Hello Kitty's like the Kool-Aid man crashing through some blocks.
4045770	4046991	I guess that's what that's all about.
4047031	4047412	That's on the 3D.
4050212	4076364	still no mouth yes on the 3DS going to the European release dates since DarkSakura is not here I'll try to jump in there and check out the European release dates on October the 12th Dishonored on the 360, Playstation 3 and PC, Fable the Journey on the Xbox 360, Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 on October 12th Rocksmith on the 360 and Playstation 3 is that the initial release of the game there?
4076724	4077665	Maybe they didn't have it before.
4078906	4088354	WRC3 on the Vita, PlayStation 3, PC, and 360, and XCOM Enemy Unknown across the 360, PS3, and PC.
4088394	4092578	So a lot of the same stuff in Europe that we're getting here, so they don't have to wait for a lot of that.
4093178	4096360	Just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4096460	4097681	I was going to add one more thing, though.
4097861	4100003	I got some news this week that was pretty awesome.
4100363	4100983	What's that?
4101824	4106327	Because my rep over at D3 knows I'm a huge Earth Defense Force fan.
4106867	4112851	Earth Defense Force 3 Portable came out in Japan on the 27th of September.
4113272	4119676	Being localized, coming out over here February 12th as Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable.
4120436	4120957	Hell yes.
4121237	4122238	Hooray, you're happy.
4123278	4124139	I don't have to import it!
4126522	4129385	We knew there was a cult enough fandom for it here, right?
4129565	4130867	Oh yeah.
4130887	4132549	You're not the only one that loves this series.
4132689	4133150	I can't wait.
4133190	4135432	And Earth Defense Force 4 hopefully is right around the corner.
4135512	4137915	That I may import depending on how long it takes to get over here.
4138215	4142860	I'm going to throw something out here too that was not in the news otherwise.
4142880	4147525	And that is that it's confirmed that there's more DLC coming for Mass Effect for multiplayer.
4148226	4150969	And it looks like one of the most robust ones they've done yet.
4151069	4154913	Like, I guess there's going to be overall 16 new classes, which seems crazy to me.
4154953	4156555	I think they're rolling it out slowly or something.
4156575	4158858	I think there's only four to start and then there'll be more.
4159678	4185440	but new maps it's some of the older maps with weather effects now and the weather will impact some things but one of the biggest things that really surprised me a fourth enemy race which is really cool and what the game could really use some of so you have the Geth you have the Cerberus you have the Reapers and now you're going to have the Collectors which was a big part of Mass Effect 2 that's coming back so that's awesome
4187697	4189819	I don't think we have a date for that yet, do we?
4191281	4191861	No, maybe we do.
4191902	4193623	It might be as soon as this Tuesday, actually.
4194004	4195105	I think it's coming out really soon.
4195345	4198088	BioWare tends to announce these things and it's like, by the way, next week.
4199997	4222814	Cool, so this is very sad, apparently Sony is suing the fictional character Kevin Butler And by suing the fictional character, actually suing the actor that plays him, Jerry Lambert And apparently this is also, I think this has to do with their new commercial they're in for Bridgestone Because they're also suing them as well
4223714	4232160	Um, basically, uh, he was playing, I guess, a competitor, he was playing Mario Kart on the Wii, um, for that commercial.
4232861	4239885	And so, apparently, I guess, later on, they edited the commercial and removed him from it entirely, which is kind of weird.
4240146	4247951	And then, I guess, um, perhaps, maybe, there's some sort of clause or something that he couldn't be seen, um,
4250779	4263807	They said the use of the Kevin Butler character to sell products other than those from PlayStation misappropriates Sony's intellectual property and creates confusion in the market and causes damage to Sony.
4265048	4266429	Although I don't think he was...
4268310	4274152	I don't know if it was actually, he wasn't playing Kevin Butler in the commercial.
4274412	4275212	He's just an actor.
4275593	4282435	You can't sue because he's playing a different character that happens to be playing a video game or something like that.
4282595	4285716	It's not like he's like, I'm Kevin Butler with Sony, I'm playing Mario Kart, you know?
4285896	4287197	Yeah, yeah, he didn't do that.
4287477	4301948	But, I mean, people did notice it was him, and I'm sure there's a lot of people doing a double take, but it's like, actors have to work, and they have to take whatever jobs are offered to them, and if Sony cut him loose, then he should be free to look for other work elsewhere, playing other characters.
4302028	4307873	Like, he can't not play a manager for the rest of his life, because people might think it's the Sony guy.
4308433	4310155	Like, I don't know, that seems a little messed up to me.
4310575	4314158	I think people usually know enough to know, like, oh, it's the same guy.
4314178	4314718	Yeah.
4314898	4341549	maybe it's because Sony was trying to push so hard that Kevin Butler was like a real thing when they brought him out of the press conference a few years ago and so forth at E3 like maybe that's more what they're worried about but that's kind of Sony that built that up right yeah it's weird though because I mean it at no point from what I remember um at no point in that commercial did they ever refer to him as Kevin or refer to him as like anything um
4343098	4345379	I don't know, it's just, it's weird.
4346939	4350420	Like, you know, most people know how to differentiate actors from one project to another.
4350460	4354241	Like, just because somebody plays a villain in one movie doesn't mean they're, like, always a villain.
4354281	4356282	Although, I guess some people get, you know, typecast.
4356422	4358342	Like, Daniel Radcliffe is not fucking Harry Potter.
4358362	4359503	That's right, you're right, exactly.
4359523	4363344	He's not Harry... That's why he did that play with the nudie stuff, is he wanted to do...
4363984	4366407	Women in Black is not Harry Potter and the Women in Black.
4366587	4369771	It is a totally different movie.
4370251	4374375	Just because this guy is in a commercial doesn't mean it's fucking Kevin Butler.
4374736	4376317	That's my problem.
4376397	4377959	How can they even sue over this?
4378440	4381523	They can do whatever they want because they're Sony and they can bully whatever they want.
4381803	4382323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4408504	4411025	Like, she's an actress, okay?
4411105	4416466	She had to take on a role of a person not a lot of people really care for, you know?
4417786	4419907	Let her be other parts in other movies.
4420287	4427669	Like, when I watched Battlestar Galactica, I didn't go, oh, Selina's dad is a spaceship captain now.
4428809	4432430	Wasn't that the teacher from Stand and Deliver?
4435331	4435611	Anyhow.
4437884	4447197	Chiggers asks, can that guy ever do another commercial without thinking of him being Kevin Butler?
4447497	4449019	Well, I guess Loki gave a good example.
4449059	4451723	Can you ever think of Daniel Radcliffe as anything but Harry Potter?
4454207	4460451	I was just really quickly, I was trying to watch the commercial real quick to see if he's got a name tag or if they refer to him as... Actually, I'm going to do this real quick.
4474079	4496167	I'm just gonna see well let me read some other comments while you're working there Frisbee in chat says anyone who thinks Mario Kart is a Sony product those people are crazy yo Dungeon Buster says it was funny seeing him push the Wii in the commercial though Dungeon Buster says the only thing I could think of was it's nice to see Kevin Butler having fun with the Wii damn I need new tires
4497516	4497977	Success.
4498437	4499558	The commercial was a success.
4499618	4504181	It got you to think about tires and that you might need to take a trip to the tire store.
4505542	4512347	SJ100Matt says, All I have to say is no one cares about the dude you got a Dell guy anymore.
4514388	4519652	Yeah, they don't really even refer to him at all by any name at all.
4519932	4521694	I mean, it's just he's playing a character.
4521774	4523495	So this whole lawsuit is fucking retarded.
4526204	4553980	and I feel bad after all the good shit I mean he was he was like a spokesperson for you know Sony that actually kind of got people excited about Sony stuff and here's the way they go and treat him yeah thanks Sony's had a lot of missteps in their advertising over the years and Kevin Butler was one of the things they did right and then they end it they end it and then they go they go they end it and then take a giant dump on it hey we're gonna fucking sue you because you're in a commercial for Bridgestone playing a Wii it's like dude
4555342	4558003	You're the one that fucking let him go, you stupid idiot.
4558103	4562725	He could have been still pitching, you know, Sony stuff, but you said, eh, fuck it, we're getting rid of him.
4562945	4569208	Now, Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room says, actors generally have non- He's the voice of realism here.
4570268	4578332	Actors generally have non-compete clauses about not directly or indirectly promoting a competing product when they do ad work for a certain time.
4579072	4584595	He might have violated his non-compete clause, which was in the contract that his agent should have known, but not him.
4585075	4588997	But technically, I mean, just play devil's advocate, technically it was for the tire shop.
4589258	4591419	The ad was not for a Wii, it was for the tire shop.
4592439	4595701	So that's where things get a little fuzzy-wuzzy here.
4596301	4600124	Like, I mean, what if he's... What if this Kevin Butler... I keep calling him Kevin Butler.
4600144	4601265	It's not fucking Kevin Butler.
4601345	4602466	It's an actual person.
4602886	4615775	No, but what if, for example, you know, they... He walks past, you know... What if Jerry Lambert walks past, like, an Xbox 360 or something that happens to be on?
4615815	4617997	And they go, oh, whoa, hold on.
4618457	4620619	You were too close to another console.
4620639	4621519	We're going to sue you.
4621579	4622100	I mean, this...
4622700	4646063	what if he gets a sitcom role or something like that and his kids are playing a fucking Xbox 360 or something what Bobby's saying in chat though does make sense I mean like okay for example Catherine Zeta-Jones was T-Mobile for how many years right like she was the reason a lot of people went to T-Mobile she was a great spokesperson for that company why they ever let her go I'll never know but like it's not like she started doing commercials for AT&T right after that you know
4649531	4659453	Anyhow, but at the same time, if she's talking on an iPhone in a movie, can T-Mobile sue her because they don't have the iPhone?
4660453	4662114	That might be stretching it a little bit, right?
4664034	4664994	I think it's ridiculous.
4665334	4668855	But apparently, if there's anything out of it, they're going to try to settle out of court.
4669115	4672076	It's stupid.
4672776	4673336	It's stupid.
4674192	4674673	Sweet Coden 1 and 2
4689192	4690833	Great PlayStation role-playing games.
4690893	4695056	Actually, there were five of them, but a lot of people remember very fondly the first two that were on PlayStation.
4695556	4708786	And this Facebook group, the Suikoden Revival Movement, is a group that's trying to organize to get Konami's attention to get Suikoden 1 and 2 available on PlayStation Network worldwide.
4709606	4715412	I was trying to get to the bottom of this because I'm like, wait a minute, I have Suikoden on PlayStation Network.
4715472	4718094	I bought it several years ago, so I know that's already there.
4718495	4721157	But this is, I suppose, a campaign to get it done worldwide.
4721518	4724401	My understanding is that Suikoden 1 is not available in Europe.
4724961	4727942	Sweet Coden 2 is kind of a rare game, too.
4728002	4732783	I mean, like, people pay a lot of money to get copies of that game if you can actually find it anywhere.
4733544	4740566	So it would be, although it would suck for the collectors to have it devalued a little bit, it's not like that kind of stuff hasn't happened before.
4740666	4746147	So a lot of people asking, well, where's Sweet Coden 2, which some people say was the best that was in the series?
4746227	4747928	It is a little odd that that is missing.
4748448	4764711	So there is a fan campaign going on on Facebook and it's basically kind of like Operation Rainfall-esque where it's like bug Konami on Twitter on Tuesday, bug Konami on Facebook on Friday and just keep banging down their door until they get you what you want to shut you up.
4765471	4769153	Facebook.com slash SuikodenRevival is the place.
4769173	4769613	Check that out.
4769753	4780078	S-U-I-K-O-D-E-N-R-E-V-I-V-A-L if you feel like joining in on the campaign, which I bet Shane is going to sign up for right now, although he probably already has the games on PlayStation.
4780438	4782319	Wasn't there PSP remakes in Japan, too?
4782379	4783099	I think I remember that.
4783540	4783820	Maybe.
4784520	4786581	And then, is 1 and 2 really good enough?
4786641	4788521	Or don't you want 3, 4, and 5 at some point?
4788981	4793262	Now that they're putting PlayStation 2 games out on the PlayStation Network?
4793662	4793762	Eh?
4794963	4795263	Alright.
4796243	4802785	Well, let's move on to a time when gaming was a lot simpler and you didn't get to petition companies to tell them what you want.
4804710	4806672	You took what you got and you liked it.
4806792	4809514	It's the classic game of the week.
4810415	4816279	Every week on the show, DarkSakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.
4816299	4817140	But she's not here.
4817220	4818581	She's too busy on the Matterhorn.
4819362	4824806	So I'm jumping in and taking the classic game because Loki never told me if he wanted to do it.
4825086	4826427	So I'm going to do the classic game tonight.
4826868	4831952	And I try to pick things I think DarkSakura may not have heard of and things I remember from my past.
4832392	4836053	So the classic game of the week I picked this week is an edutainment title.
4836313	4836953	A little different.
4837433	4841294	It's called The Island of Dr. Brain is my classic game of the week.
4843594	4850635	Now, really we should kind of consider Dr. Brain as a series because The Island of Dr. Brain was not really the first game in this series.
4850995	4853596	The Castle of Dr. Brain was the first game in this series.
4853976	4857597	But Dr. Brain was a series that had, I think, four games in it.
4857657	4858037	There was...
4859837	4870382	There was the island of Dr. Brain, the castle of Dr. Brain was before that, and then later on, like about three years later, we had the Lost Mind of Dr. Brain and the Time Warp of Dr. Brain, although I don't remember those games as fondly.
4870783	4887171	And I think part of that is because Sierra, who actually created those first two games, created those in-house, but then they acquired Bright Star Technology, who was known for educational games, it got turned over to them, they made the Lost Mind of Dr. Brain and the Time Warp of Dr. Brain.
4887751	4899104	So Dr. Brain is an absent-minded professor, and basically the idea in the games is to kind of follow Dr. Brain and kind of find him wherever he is.
4899624	4907453	Obviously, The Island of Dr. Brain is kind of a play on The Island of Dr. Moreau, like the classic movie that then they remade into a terrible movie and so forth.
4908073	4910376	Dr. Brain's Island of Dr. Brain
4924612	4925914	The Islet of Dr. Brain
4942395	4944296	to get further and further in the island.
4944316	4946076	And there were many types of different puzzles.
4946116	4953479	There was like Tetris, Tetorino Animo, I forget what they call those.
4953839	4960141	Those types of puzzles, the classic Tower of Babel style puzzles where you're moving the little towers from one pole to another.
4960581	4966323	Graphing calculator puzzles where you had to get the exact, thank you, Tetromino puzzles.
4966863	4972948	where you had to get the graph to draw just right to separate the four types of little amoebas under the microscope.
4974309	4975831	Latitude and longitude puzzles.
4975851	4978493	There were all these different types of puzzles in the game.
4980134	4989402	Basically, in the plot of the game, the plans for the latest project were stolen and you have to get the battery from the island and bring it to Dr. Brain to basically fix the situation.
4989782	4993125	There's security puzzles that Dr. Brain set up all over the island, though.
4993545	4994586	That is what you're solving.
4995126	4996567	So yeah, it was a Sierra game.
4996647	4998268	It was for DOS back in 1992.
4999229	5002991	And although it was kind of an educational title, I don't know, I kind of like puzzle games.
5003071	5007174	It kind of set the precedent for a lot of fun puzzle games.
5007895	5009436	So that's really it.
5009456	5010496	That's all I have to say about it.
5010697	5012398	There's not a lot else to say.
5012738	5016520	It's got a variety of different types of puzzles in it, and it's worth checking out.
5016681	5021143	And the prequel as well, The Castle of Dr. Brain, was also a solid entry in the series.
5021564	5021964	So there you go.
5021984	5024806	This week's Classic Game of the Week, The Island of Dr. Brain.
5025287	5030615	Therefore, just follow the trail of my security puzzles if you have any problems solving them.
5030635	5031457	Just give me a call.
5035290	5035830	Good times.
5055490	5072461	Alright, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere guys, we have plenty more of show to come, including Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, emails, if we got any, there weren't any in there last time I looked, the FUs of the Week, and of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5072541	5085010	Maybe you have something to say about this whole Kevin Butler situation, or Cliffy B leaving Epic Games, or porn on the 360, or whatever you want to talk about, we'll be taking your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5085750	5088773	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5088853	5094238	We are live with episode number 476 of our show for this October the 7th of 2012.
5095920	5098042	Just myself and Loki holding down the fort tonight.
5098062	5106149	If you're just joining us, DarkSakura, she is at the happiest place on earth, which is even happier today with the Gay Days Anaheim going on right now.
5106590	5108812	I know a lot of people that are there right now.
5109532	5130314	and you might be wondering why aren't you there um my pass expired for Disney I had an annual pass for Disneyland it actually expired at the end of September so I wouldn't have been able to make it and um it's like $450 or something to renew right now which you know if I was in a better financial situation I'd spend it because that's you know it's Disneyland's a great place but uh
5131054	5134177	I'm going to use the excuse to kind of take some time off from Disney for a while.
5134257	5135678	I was just there two weeks ago anyway.
5135718	5138000	That was the point, was to be like the last hurrah.
5138881	5143365	But Jamie, she's enjoying it for now while I'm on a little bit of hiatus.
5143625	5149470	And she'll be back next week to pick a new classic game of the week and do all the things she does on the show.
5149510	5151672	But meanwhile, Loki and I holding down the fort.
5151812	5156716	Alright, Loki, you gotta tell the listeners what you were telling me during the break about your shopping excursions here.
5156756	5158458	I'm not shopping on anything.
5158658	5162962	No, I'm making, well, designing something right now.
5162982	5164143	Sorry, plotting.
5164203	5165964	You're plotting something over there, clearly.
5165984	5167786	It's not necessarily shopping.
5168526	5175009	Um, so no, I was, um, you know, I'm always looking for, like, DDR machines and stuff like that.
5175469	5178570	So one of the things I wanted to do was rebuild my, you know, DDR pads.
5178631	5181652	And, you know, I kind of saw, you know, all the designs that are out there and stuff.
5181692	5185053	I actually had bought stuff to make a certain, uh, design.
5185133	5187514	But I just kind of don't want to do that one anymore.
5187614	5190235	So I happened to catch there was, um...
5191736	5198440	On Bomani Sao's site, some guy was selling one of his beat gear pads.
5198580	5207005	Now, if you don't remember, beat gear pads, at one time there was a guy that was going to be creating the most arcade authentic pads out there.
5207446	5209747	And then we played some awesome music.
5209787	5217151	Sorry, I guess it was appropriate since Loki's talking about old games to play the classic Game of the Week music.
5217252	5217712	Sorry about that.
5218972	5231835	So anyways, so this guy's selling the beatgear pad and they've got some shots of it and stuff and that kind of linked to another website that had some more shots of the pad and likes it taken apart and stuff like that.
5231936	5244399	So based on those pictures, I'm designing the schematics for it to make my own or to mass produce them if I want to since no one has done it.
5244859	5244959	And
5245819	5247040	Yeah, so that's why I'm working on it.
5247060	5248621	But you wouldn't scam people out of their money.
5250222	5250463	No.
5251243	5253065	You're an honest guy, and I know where you live.
5253285	5256107	Exactly, everyone knows where I live.
5256127	5268376	No, I was kind of curious to see how much it's going to cost to do it and how I would actually have to do it, because I think it looked like it was injected molded plastic and stuff, and they use different sensors than arcade sensors.
5268396	5268656	They use...
5269757	5272778	They're tape switches, or what they're called, I guess.
5272938	5274839	You can actually buy those really cheap.
5274919	5281562	They come in a big, long string of them.
5282042	5289905	I think I found them for $10 for eight feet of that stuff, and you'd only need a few inches per pad.
5290865	5317214	um maybe a few feet per pad um but I mean 10 bucks for you know a ton of switches versus 10 bucks a switch kind of a kind of a big deal there but um yeah so arcade parts they actually use the arcade arrows they use um the way I'm designing is going to use arcade um neons as well um and I don't know about the arcade switches because those are really fucking expensive I'd rather go the tape tape switch route um
5317654	5320196	You'll always be the DDR fan, now and forever.
5320316	5320897	Exactly.
5321377	5322338	I always am.
5322378	5324439	Half the stuff I do is for DDR stuff.
5324680	5325520	I did it for the dinner.
5326761	5328843	But yeah, so that's what I've been working on.
5328863	5330164	Actually, that's what I've been working on this week.
5330484	5341773	Last few days I've been playing Minecraft or anything, or Borderlands 2, because I've been playing in SketchUp trying to draw what I see and getting the measurements right based on...
5342633	5345676	Other things that are injection molded and stuff like that.
5346116	5348478	They have the support braces and stuff in there.
5349299	5351080	Just getting the right size.
5351180	5353122	I think I have nailed it pretty well.
5354723	5358026	Just knowing measurements of different things.
5359087	5359387	We'll see.
5360628	5362509	The thing about injection molding stuff is...
5363934	5392126	it may be somewhat cheap for the parts but the initial cost is pretty expensive so it may not even be by the time I'm done worth it doing because make the parts would be a few thousand dollars which you know it's good if you're mass producing them because then you know you cost average all that stuff out and it gets pretty cheap but if you're making like one pad or two pads that might not work out too well you know it'd be well over the cost of a DDR machine what's the point at that point
5393827	5394087	All right.
5394127	5400452	Well, before we get into rapid fire news to take things a slightly different direction for a minute, I like some of this reminiscing people are doing in the chat room.
5400752	5403755	They're talking about this service Imagination.
5403935	5410480	I personally never heard of that one, but they're talking about some of the other old school dial-up services and things that used to exist back in the day.
5410840	5411421	Qlink.
5411501	5412121	I remember that one.
5412161	5413582	Wasn't that actually called Quantum Link?
5413602	5414903	And then I think they shortened it to Qlink.
5415284	5415544	I don't know.
5422529	5426371	I remember that and I always wanted to get on that with my 300 baud modem.
5427111	5430352	But my parents, you know, I was only like probably eight at the time.
5430372	5431333	Didn't want me on that stuff.
5431753	5434854	But Vandy brought up Genie and Prodigy.
5435234	5435914	I was on Prodigy.
5436035	5438996	I was on Prodigy too and I still remember my number to this day.
5439016	5441017	I think I know I've talked about it on a previous show.
5441497	5444138	I got in a lot of trouble thanks to Prodigy chat rooms.
5444298	5444598	Oh yeah.
5445718	5469786	I got in trouble just I think because one of the Prodigy numbers it dialed was a long distance number and we were on it for like a long time so it like you know it racked up a pretty big phone bill but yeah the earliest modem I had was just a 2400 baud modem but yeah BBSs that was some good times oh I spent so much time on BBSs back in the day
5471087	5471727	It's crazy.
5472347	5475889	And BBSs wouldn't suddenly disconnect the stream like apparently just happened here.
5475989	5476670	What is up?
5477250	5478471	That's a Comcast issue, guys.
5478491	5478951	It's not us.
5478991	5479491	I'm sorry.
5481333	5482453	We should be back online now, though.
5482473	5483414	It shows the streaming data.
5483454	5483974	But where were we?
5484054	5484714	Oh, BBSs.
5486515	5488857	I used to call so many BBSs when I was like 12 to 15.
5488937	5492179	What we used to have was the California Computer News magazine.
5492199	5492459	Yes.
5492599	5495841	You and I probably hung out on the same BBSs and didn't even know it.
5497561	5497982	Maybe.
5498002	5498803	Probably.
5498983	5505450	What were some of the big... My favorite BBS back in the day in the Sacramento area was one called The Open Mind.
5505470	5506531	I still remember it to this day.
5506932	5509254	But it was huge on the forums.
5509454	5511156	It had a very active forum community.
5511216	5512738	I met a lot of great people on there.
5513138	5516722	And then there was one you could dial into to play Doom 2 online.
5517503	5520424	But that was the one where you had to buy credits after you used so much.
5522904	5526225	I can't remember some of the big ones that were here locally, but I used to play all that shit.
5526285	5532066	Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars 2002, The Pit with its graphical client.
5532586	5533126	Amazing.
5533726	5539048	There was one BBS I used to dial into that actually would let you have internet access for like 15 minutes a day.
5539728	5541208	That was fantastic.
5542147	5543888	and then also all the AOL discs.
5543948	5547269	I mean, you would just be swimming in those things.
5547289	5548069	You'd go to cancel.
5548149	5549070	Hey, would you like in there a free month?
5549150	5549490	Yeah, sure.
5550590	5551111	Free month.
5551411	5562315	I remember asking and begging my mom to let me call the long distance number to the Sierra BBS for like 20 minutes so I could download a game demo that I really want.
5562335	5567797	I don't even remember what it was now but there was something on there that I really wanted because Sierra had an official BBS back in the day.
5568397	5569098	Good times.
5570019	5572341	Dial back verification, all that good stuff.
5572701	5576484	I tried running a BBS, but my parents would never let me have the second line.
5577004	5584471	So it was one of those, you know, my really good friend Neil could call in when we set up a certain time.
5584751	5587033	And then my mom would pick up the phone to call one of her friends.
5588014	5589295	Rob, what the hell are you doing?
5590885	5591325	Good times.
5593187	5594007	All right, let's move on.
5594528	5595228	Enough reminiscing.
5595248	5596489	Let's talk rapid-fire news.
5597069	5597990	Loki, start us off.
5598210	5600632	All right, I'm very excited about this game coming out.
5600672	5603134	It's been a long, long time coming.
5603954	5611440	Retro City Rampage, which originally started off as a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES and then just spun out from there.
5611460	5616683	And it has so many homages to, like, just all this 8-bit stuff.
5616743	5617764	You know, they've got...
5619105	5620106	Everything you can possibly think of.
5620127	5630579	They have levels that are based off of Metal Gear, levels based off of Breakthrough, levels based off of Bionic Commando, Mega Man, Blaster Master, all sorts of crazy stuff.
5631260	5634384	It's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
5634544	5637928	They're doing the cross-buy thing too with that, so that's where I'm purchasing it.
5639029	5644033	Although I do also want it on my Xbox 360 and maybe on Steam.
5644273	5647115	So I may actually purchase it on every single platform that comes out.
5647535	5651998	But it's $14.99, so that'll be coming out this week on the 9th.
5652958	5653359	Can't wait.
5653399	5655000	That'll probably be the game I'm playing this week.
5655080	5659703	And it's very much like a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 type game, top down.
5659743	5661064	But it's just all sorts of crazy.
5661124	5662665	There's like Super Meat Boy stuff.
5662885	5666347	There's a Super Meat Boy game that's done like the Virtual Boy in the game.
5666548	5668349	So it's going to be fantastic.
5671334	5680093	Also this week, one of the announcements, I guess, Namco Bandai is removing Nobi Nobi Boy from the iOS App Store, also on Tuesday.
5682003	5685884	And apparently they haven't really said why it's being removed.
5685924	5688685	It is being removed by Namco Bandai, not Apple.
5688806	5692927	But apparently there's some functionality that hasn't been working for a few months.
5693027	5699189	So maybe they've just decided that we're going to get rid of it or something.
5699209	5703171	It's kind of sad.
5703331	5707012	But if you want to play the game, I guess download it now so you have it.
5708533	5708973	And it is $1.99. $1.99.
5711886	5713648	And then there's a new Kickstarter.
5714108	5715310	I actually saw this one.
5715350	5717572	The Kickstarter for Old School RPG.
5718473	5723938	It's being created by Brenda Brathwaite and Tom Hall.
5725520	5733628	You may not remember them, but of course they worked on some of the older game series like Wizardry and Dungeons & Dragons.
5733928	5736890	I was like, Brenda Brathwaite actually sounds very familiar.
5736950	5739212	She was like an old school RPG person, right?
5739232	5742013	Yeah, and then Tom Hall was the founder of id Software.
5742334	5743254	He made Commander Keen.
5745116	5746797	Holy shit, Commander Keen.
5747377	5752641	That's one of those demos I downloaded for 30 minutes on my 2014 or whatever.
5752821	5760326	Man, one of the things I liked doing was we had a local video store that had a shareware table.
5760846	5763588	A table where you just buy floppy disks of all sorts of games.
5764989	5765749	Good times, man.
5793870	5794706	in less than a minute.
5797076	5799057	Think of where we're going to be 20 years from now.
5799717	5800198	Not even.
5800218	5801218	Crazy shit.
5801298	5802339	Like five years from now.
5802359	5803279	Crazy shit.
5803699	5804300	Anyhow, sorry.
5807101	5815926	Apparently if you pledge $15 you'll get a digital copy of the game and of course they've got all sorts of different things.
5816166	5825271	They even have a $10,000 pledge point where they will show up to your door with a red velvet or deliver the game in a box on a red velvet pillow on a red carpet.
5825851	5853397	so that's pretty funny and you know they also had one of their stretch goals is that they'll make two full games so neat also DLC Quest the game we kind of talked about a while I actually played it on the indie games but it's one of the games that's on the whole green light thing and one of their promises if they get green lit is that they're going to add some new content which is good because that game's only like one or two hours long
5854257	5876296	and the new DLC is going to be called live freemium or die and they have I guess a new campaign world or new campaign new world new enemies and buckets of new DLC to purchase and that they're saying that that's at the launch um the fourth quarter of this year uh which is pretty funny and um
5878405	5905300	and yeah, and then that's it alrighty I got a few stories for you guys as well first off, something about Star Wars Final Assault hopefully this will be one of the Star Wars games that isn't terrible because they're hit and miss sometimes they're really good sometimes they're really not good but Star Wars Final Assault will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade there is an image out there floating around of the actual artwork that will be used on the arcade that's kind of how they spilled it there
5906461	5911185	So the game was first announced way back in August when there were trademark and domain registrations.
5911265	5914768	But this game, it's funny to note, still has not been officially announced.
5914908	5916690	So we don't even really know exactly what it is.
5917310	5918672	Yeah, they haven't announced it.
5918792	5919733	It came out of a leak.
5919953	5921174	There was a leak of all the different...
5921754	5926840	All the fourth quarter titles that were coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.
5926860	5931064	There's actually some other ones I saw that were interesting, but I don't remember what it was.
5931725	5934367	Well, could one of them be this game I'm going to mention next?
5934648	5935369	Karateka?
5935789	5936630	I could never say this.
5936670	5937651	It's basically karate.
5937931	5938532	Karateka.
5938712	5939793	I guess that's the way you would say it.
5939833	5940354	Karateka.
5941134	5943956	I remember this old, old game.
5943996	5947438	This was back in the Commodore 64 days and all that, and it was in the arcades too.
5947739	5949280	There's a remake now coming out.
5949480	5958185	Obviously it's now 3D, a little more inspired by the Street Fighter IVs of the world and so forth, but still kind of cool that it's on Xbox Live Arcade.
5958245	5959266	It's small enough to be there.
5960027	5964450	Xbox.com actually had this posted.
5964490	5969533	It wasn't supposed to be an official announcement, but people that were scouring Xbox.com actually found it.
5970333	5973275	This one is supposed to be out, I believe, relatively soon.
5973335	5975537	November-ish is when that remake is coming out.
5975597	5977278	November 16th?
5977558	5977778	14th?
5978359	5981201	14th, that link is to be believed that was found on Xbox.com.
5983723	5985744	This fad isn't going to die anytime soon.
5985784	5987985	It's the Gangnam Style Dance.
5988906	5989306	Ah, yes.
5989867	5992909	It's now available to your character in Free Realms.
5993649	5998513	You might remember Free Realms as the free-to-play MMO that's available on the PlayStation 3 and
5999677	6000778	It sucks.
6001759	6003640	But hey, you can do this dance in the game.
6003901	6005322	Here's what I love about the trailer.
6006183	6008384	They can't use the actual music.
6008565	6009766	Oh, son of a bitch.
6009806	6011027	I don't care about the E.T.
6011087	6011667	re-release.
6011727	6013989	Show me the freaking movie I really want to see.
6014009	6015450	And they don't have walkie-talkies anymore.
6015751	6016311	That's important.
6017152	6018133	Even on the Blu-ray version?
6018413	6019594	I thought they went back to it.
6019894	6020895	No, they got rid of it, I think.
6021575	6023377	I thought Spielberg said he regretted that.
6024057	6025579	Do we need to have a conversation about E.T. ?
6026907	6027607	All right, here we go.
6027627	6028328	Here's the actual trailer.
6028568	6030088	They have to use fake music.
6030668	6034750	Even though it's the actual dance.
6036671	6037791	Here's the problem with this.
6037871	6041492	Not only is Free Realms kind of crap, but let's be real.
6041592	6047174	The moment that sold that video for most people was when he was dancing over the guy in the elevator.
6047274	6051176	That was the best part of the entire video, and I don't see that represented here in Free Realms.
6052935	6056316	and everybody's saying, why aren't the panda bears doing this in Mists of Pandaria?
6056936	6062597	Well, because they programmed that dance in like nine months ago, way before Gangnam Style was a thing.
6063477	6064137	And there you have it.
6066038	6069138	Apparently, a Wii U demo interface has been shown.
6069559	6074640	This is because the Wii U demo kiosk is now available in the official store in New York City.
6075120	6077140	So I don't know if some of our New York City fans are nearby.
6077160	6079381	I want to check that out, but you can check that out.
6079441	6080781	It's a Wii U demo station.
6081361	6105531	and it has some of the cover art for some of the various games there you can select whatever demo cover art you want to play and you get a video or you get to actually play the demo depending on what it is apparently only Rayman Legends is actually usable but who knows I mean this is still really early on the console is still a good month and a half away so I imagine they'll add more to this but that's available at the official Nintendo store so those of you that are in New York might want to check that out
6107173	6111348	Alright, let's move on to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6121576	6125500	Ranma, the ever great reporter for VOG, says he'll go by there tomorrow.
6125900	6126401	Check it out.
6127302	6128102	Get on it, Ranma.
6129884	6130705	All right.
6131946	6132847	Fugo question of the week.
6133027	6133948	Very simple this week.
6134008	6136190	I thought I'd tie it into what we talked about at the beginning of the show.
6136591	6139734	What's the scariest video game you've ever played and why?
6142313	6143054	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6166703	6190031	James S replied there's another games on PC that I haven't played but would love to like Amnesia or Slenderman my computer is ancient so I have to go with a console game I know it sounds cliche but Silent Hill 2 and 3 collection was phenomenal I can't remember how many times I had to turn it off when playing alone at night because I was literally dreading turning around that next darkened corner freaky music in the background and none of the stupid team co-op stuff to ruin it
6190831	6192132	Dead Space 1 and 2 Need I Say More?
6212681	6235945	Shattered Hawk says as a kid I used to own Shadow Man for the N64 the music mixed with monsters gave me nightmares the pig guys with the hooks that screamed when they spotted you still gives me the chills I never played that game but that sounds scary Tim N says Silent Hill 2 it is peerless as far as horror goes the rest are pretenders some strong words there
6236945	6239827	Gamer Girl says, I know you only asked for one, but I have two.
6239947	6242109	Eternal Darkness was really scary for me.
6242569	6246612	I don't know, but when you get to the part where your heart starts racing in game, it was over for me in real life.
6247132	6247352	Why?
6247412	6248613	Because I'm a huge music lover.
6248673	6249874	I feel whatever I'm listening to.
6249974	6251955	Same goes for Fear, F-E-A-R.
6252276	6256519	Those are two of the most scariest games for me, but somehow I still love it.
6257758	6260659	Dan Shadow says the original fear was really creepy.
6261120	6264361	The first few missions had great jump scares and you didn't.
6264401	6265522	He spoils part two.
6265542	6267182	You'll have to read that on Facebook to see that.
6268123	6270004	Mike B says Jaws Unleashed.
6270104	6271264	It was scary bad.
6272005	6273625	I knew somebody would go with the showgirls.
6274025	6275446	I thought Jaws wasn't that bad.
6275726	6278888	I don't know if it was Unleashed though.
6279008	6281749	Wasn't that like the remake one where you can play as the shark?
6281789	6283290	Yeah, the shark one looked fun.
6283550	6283850	I don't know.
6284691	6286852	Dave Falcon said, return to Castle Wolfenstein.
6287132	6290312	There was a small part in the game that just startled the crap out of me during gameplay.
6290652	6296273	I was walking through a snowy field and everything was quiet and calm and the Nazis jumped out of nowhere and made me jump out of my skin.
6296353	6297214	Shot the crap out of me.
6297314	6298394	Nazis always scare me.
6299214	6305355	Another vote for Silent Hill 2 from Clover N. Chiggers says, Bioshock had a moment that scared the shit out of me.
6305795	6309776	One of those zombie dudes jumped out from behind a coffin and made me drop the controller.
6309876	6310676	Fucking zombies.
6311637	6312977	Bioshock was really scary.
6314137	6336431	DDR Dollar Bill says Haunted House on the 2600 when you could not see the walls at all no weapons and could not even see behind the doors drop my damn controller every time I opened one and a damn spider or bat or ghost killed me quite honestly I'd like to see a follow up of scariest moments Haunted House on the 2600 was kind of old school survival horror I think they remade that for the 360 yeah and it's shit yeah
6338326	6341189	and DJ Ranma S replied and said, Bioshock.
6342070	6346954	And a very similar story to what Chiggers had mentioned before with somebody popping out there.
6347275	6349377	He said, well played 2K Games, well played.
6349797	6351979	Let's go to Google Plus and look at some of the answers there.
6352900	6355662	Marcus E. says, Haunting Ground.
6356829	6363071	Even though the Capcom game focuses on a busty gal running around like some horror flick, it managed to be much deeper.
6363511	6369893	Any game where your only option is to run seems scary by default, but the atmosphere in Haunting Ground was fantastic.
6370253	6378015	Pair that with supremely creepy stalkers, foreboding locations, and a terrifying soundtrack, and the game was one of the best horror titles.
6378575	6381576	I must give you one example of how the game managed to be so scary.
6382136	6384998	Haunted Ground focuses on hiding since you can rarely fight back.
6385399	6390323	At one point, I was running from an antagonist, rushed down a hallway into a room, and
6392408	6418724	went down in the room and went to hide in the closet guess what she was in the closet waiting for me moments like that just made the game near perfect Actdeft says aside from Silent Hill, Eversion that game is really fucked up and so much too lastly Red Entertainment says Silent Hill 3 I had to stop playing that game near the end so the fear that was building up in my body could leave me I occasionally still hear the sounds of those damn demon dogs
6420025	6435053	so there it is the answers from Facebook and Google Plus Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or you can look us up on Google Plus if you want to answer in a future week some things I was surprised not to hear did you notice some of the games that were left out?
6435374	6449141	I heard one person mention Amnesia but didn't pick that as their most scary no Resident Evils I didn't hear Clock Tower which I always thought was kind of a fucked I guess that was maybe more I don't know I kind of thought it was scary Fatal Frame yeah
6450851	6453333	Kind of a lot of stuff that wasn't there, but still some good picks.
6453353	6456415	I'm not saying you guys didn't pick good stuff, but lots of love for Silent Hill, apparently.
6456815	6457275	There you go.
6458476	6459997	All right, there it is, your Fugle Question of the Week.
6460277	6461618	Let's get back into some more news.
6461718	6466021	We're not too far away from the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
6466061	6466701	Not just yet, though.
6466761	6467722	Some more news stories first.
6468202	6471985	So Sony likes doing a lot of different bundles, especially around the holidays.
6472185	6475647	And one of the things that they said, yeah, we're not...
6477428	6479950	Not going to do it, but it might be a cool idea.
6481451	6487955	Apparently they're thinking that, hey, maybe someday we'll do a bundle that includes a Vita and a PlayStation 3.
6489156	6492578	And I think that could be possible if they have some more of those games that are going to be kind of working like...
6493198	6498622	and the Wii U or the Xbox Smart Glass stuff.
6498662	6501905	So maybe if that becomes popular, they might do this.
6503726	6509971	It'd have to get a hell of a lot cheaper, though, because it's going to be a hard sell to have a portable system and a regular system in there.
6510531	6519638	Yeah, that bundle's going to have to be a heck of a deal, but it's going to look like twice as much as the Wii U. Yeah.
6520600	6522541	I don't know.
6522581	6526783	Right now, they don't have a whole lot of interconnectivity between the two systems.
6527263	6531705	Some games kind of use it, but not a whole ton.
6531725	6533066	But they could.
6533586	6534147	They could.
6534527	6535167	They could do anything.
6535207	6537448	They could bundle it with a TV.
6537628	6538469	I'm sure they've done that.
6538809	6539809	I don't know.
6540010	6546153	It's not outside the realm of possibility, but is it going to be something that people are going to be looking for?
6546653	6547013	Probably not.
6548829	6549229	Options!
6549429	6550489	Remember, people like options.
6552010	6560151	Well, some options people would like to see on the Wii U is more variety in games and some more things that address the hardcore.
6560692	6566313	And, of course, follow-ups to some of those big Operation Rainfall games, The Last Story and Xenoblade.
6566853	6577135	Well, Reggie Fils-Aimé made a comment, I believe this was to, I think it was to Kotaku, actually, about Xenoblade and The Last Story and all that.
6578837	6582000	The comment was about What is Monolith Soft doing now?
6582060	6583722	What is the Wii U game that they're making?
6584222	6593733	And the quote is this We know that they're working on a game I personally haven't seen it But I know there's a lot of excitement in Japan and Kyoto About what they're working on So I look forward to seeing it
6594233	6600956	In the end, if it's a game that we decide to publish from what would be a second-party standpoint, certainly we'd love to bring it here to the U.S.
6601416	6608659	The way we look at the opportunity is, given a level of marketing support, how much are we going to sell, and is it going to be a profitable venture?
6609279	6612080	So a whole lot of nothing kind of about, you know...
6612860	6614160	Maybe we'll release it.
6614540	6615441	Maybe we won't.
6616061	6621162	I found some of the comments on this particular website a little more interesting than the article itself.
6622142	6624643	MyNintendoNews.com is where some of these comments come from.
6625043	6629024	And some people are kind of talking about, like they're fighting about, did Xenoblade do well or not?
6629404	6633085	One commenter says, I bet the Wii U game will do well since Xenoblade did well.
6633145	6635045	Somebody replies to that, it did well.
6635105	6637626	It barely sold 300,000 copies in North America.
6637646	6638246	Let me put it this way.
6638966	6639907	I just saw this this week.
6640467	6641608	The last story, it's out of print.
6642049	6642889	They're not making it anymore.
6643029	6643810	Oh shit.
6644470	6648594	But that was something that was being put out by XSEED, so it's kind of their M.O.
6649254	6650295	Atlas does the same thing.
6651036	6655559	They kind of make a small initial lot and then they sell through it and put it out of print.
6656039	6660403	But, I mean, I don't think they sold that well.
6661058	6669882	Well, somebody replies, though, and this is a good point, okay, $300,000 doesn't seem that bad when you consider it was only available at two places, Nintendo's website or GameStop.
6670723	6675585	No Amazon, no Walmart, no Best Buy, none of that.
6675725	6676385	But it doesn't matter, though.
6676405	6679347	For the people that wanted that game, they could get it there.
6679527	6683149	And let's be honest, GameStop is the largest game retailer out there, so...
6683789	6684189	DarkSakura
6709184	6709564	DarkSakura.com
6730237	6733158	Bobby, BlackWolf wants to correct something you said.
6733479	6735579	He says Walmart is the largest game retailer.
6735879	6736359	I believe it.
6736960	6742261	GameStop may be the largest specialty retailer, but Walmart is the largest retailer of a lot of things.
6742361	6751784	Well, they're the largest retailer of, you know, retailer out there, but as far as game specialty as, you know, category, GameStop is far beyond Walmart.
6751884	6756046	Walmart may sell through a lot of stuff, but the biggest chunk is going to GameStop.
6756066	6756946	That's why I see a lot of
6757646	6786168	special stuff being done for GameStop like a lot of exclusives you don't see Walmart exclusives for that stuff on movies though you do you do see some Walmart exclusive things rarely but you do and I would argue that you probably do see more actual games at the end of the day sold at Walmart than you do at GameStop same thing with the CDs you wouldn't think Walmart's the largest CD retailer in the world but they are maybe with iTunes in the picture it's a little different now but the largest physical CD retailer in the world they're the largest retailer of a lot of stuff like it or not
6789328	6790674	Anyhow, that's all I wanted to say about that.
6792188	6793168	Let's move on, Loki.
6822177	6823578	to the Washington, D.C.
6823658	6826621	Public Library, I guess the Martin Luther King branch.
6827561	6835168	And it's going to allow different gamers with all sorts of different disabilities to be able to enjoy games.
6835208	6844255	So you're going to see games with maybe some audio-only games, that kind of stuff in there.
6844995	6845156	And
6845856	6853141	They haven't really said what specific types of games are going to be in there, but I can kind of imagine the stuff that they have.
6854002	6858224	And I guess this is opening very soon.
6859305	6861987	Or actually, by the looks of it, it's already open.
6862327	6862968	Oh, wow.
6863508	6864849	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
6865834	6867214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6889582	6897311	It's nice to hear that not only is something opening up, even though it's a library and all that stuff, so it isn't like an arcade in the traditional sense.
6898012	6905300	It's neat that not only is something opening up, but it's opening up with a broader idea in mind and something new.
6906241	6906421	Yeah.
6906622	6911186	Which, you know, now we look at it and go, oh, this is something we should have had all along, but this is a great idea.
6912728	6913829	Well, let's hope it does well for them.
6914330	6915551	Maybe it'll start a trend.
6916292	6922078	But sadly, I think with how arcades have been doing recently, I think the trend has already been had.
6923706	6928487	Anyhow, there were a few Nintendo Direct conferences this week that talk about the 3DS.
6929127	6931808	And we get to find out what's in store for the 3DS this year.
6933228	6942150	I guess there's a sequel being made to Pushmo, Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania the Adventure, and some other games developed by Level 5 and so forth.
6942190	6944311	There's some good stuff that's actually original.
6945531	6963737	Night Sky is coming out October 25th that is an action puzzle game that will be an ambient gameplay experience with cerebral challenges that will be uniquely designed picturesque worlds by the way these are all eShop titles I probably should have put that out there too Crashmo is the sequel to Pushmo on November 22nd
6965217	6968461	Fluidity Spin Cycle is on December 27th.
6968901	6970723	This is going to make use of the tilt.
6970903	6973226	Not a lot of games have been using the gyroscope in there.
6973806	6981655	So this will have tilt and turn and all that stuff to maneuver a puddle of water named Eddie through a maze-like world.
6982055	6986700	But you can do liquid to ice or steam, solid liquid gas type of thing.
6987461	6990323	Wow, that sounds just like that one game that Konami put out.
6990683	6990964	Remember?
6991304	6992305	Yeah, I remember that, I remember that.
6992345	6993125	Dewey's Adventure?
6993305	6993666	Yeah, yeah.
6994786	6996848	Nintendo eShops will get level 5 stuff.
6997028	6999250	Suda51's Liberation Maiden.
7000150	7007536	100 years in the future when the President of Japan boards her liberator, Kamui, and fights to free her country one region at a time.
7008456	7013300	Arrow Porter and Crimson Shroud are also on the table to be released by the end of the year.
7014140	7020842	and Pedestrian Tossing Pandemonium in Tokyo Crash Mobs, an action puzzle game in early 2013.
7021282	7023343	There you go.
7023803	7028364	Also, some 3DS titles that are full games that are now available for download.
7028684	7036606	Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64 3D, Mario Kart 7, all coming on October 18th for $39.99 each.
7038747	7043509	Most of those you can start to find in the bargain bins for far cheaper, so be careful, I'm just saying.
7043649	7047190	Well, it's nice to Nintendo to offer such bargains on that stuff.
7047510	7047770	Right.
7048670	7062394	Virtual Console, Mario Golf on October 11th, Castlevania The Adventure on October 25th, Ninja Gaiden on November 8th, Zelda II The Adventure of Link on November 22nd, Wario Land 2 on December 20th, and Mario Bros.
7062454	7064175	The Lost Levels on December 27th.
7066494	7070596	Also in Nintendo news, Animal Crossing 3DS updates.
7073177	7073598	Cool.
7074398	7077179	Some characters might set up a tent and camp outside.
7079080	7082022	You can help your in-game friends with purchasing decisions.
7083102	7086404	Use your office as the mayor to make decisions on putting things in town.
7087245	7091587	You pick a location for construction to begin on the items you plan on adding.
7092987	7095729	A megaphone lets you gather people.
7096576	7097857	I've got something to say.
7099298	7102040	There's now a shoe store, a museum store.
7103321	7105382	Dr. Shrunk will be back at the club.
7106523	7108524	There are now many more emotions.
7109285	7114649	You can view the homes of people you street pass and trade items with people you street pass.
7115589	7117311	You can take a picture with a photo booth.
7118191	7123155	There's now a massage parlor that will relax you and put you into a dream stage.
7124576	7127039	Maybe this is leading into Animal Crossing Happy Endings.
7127920	7128561	Be the next game.
7128601	7128961	Who knows?
7129782	7131865	You can explore the town of someone else.
7132846	7134688	Thought you could do that in the last one on the Wii.
7135169	7135890	Can't do that.
7136030	7138353	Maybe you can do that with How to Invitation or something?
7138473	7138733	Maybe.
7139774	7140134	K.K.
7140174	7144076	Slider will also be the DJ at the club as well as playing the guitar.
7144776	7145597	More K.K.
7145657	7146057	songs.
7147138	7149219	You can explore a town with other people.
7149819	7153541	You can take the boat to the island, grab items from the bottom of the sea.
7153981	7157562	There's mini games and various stores when you visit the island by boat.
7159123	7164326	Tortimer is the host of minigames and wears a tropical shirt, so it sounds like the former mayor is retired to the island.
7164687	7165467	And not dead.
7165867	7166508	And not dead.
7167689	7171891	And one minigame has you navigating a maze to collect a certain item.
7172451	7173992	What a profound and new concept.
7174493	7175413	Maze navigation.
7175513	7177154	I've never heard of that in a video game.
7182017	7186739	Frisbee in chat asks, can you still hit animals over the head with the bug catching net?
7186879	7189600	I hope so or this whole fucking game is invalidated, isn't it?
7190221	7195643	Can you drag animals into an abandoned house and set up a saw style trap system for them?
7196423	7197263	No, I'm sorry.
7197404	7198384	I'm not buying this game.
7198940	7199420	That's so wrong.
7221773	7232303	yet so right yet so right I think that's worthy enough of being a dream game to be honest Animal Crossing after dark but I'm pretty sure we've talked about something like that before Animal Crossing the line
7234215	7235676	All right, Loki, what do you got next?
7236316	7239517	All right, so next thing I've got, this is pretty cool.
7241898	7245780	So what would you say, and I completely forgot about this until I saw the article.
7246881	7250442	You remember, no doubt, in Activision, there was a little lawsuit there.
7250462	7251102	Oh, yeah, I remember this.
7251122	7258205	They were suing because, you know, people were singing other songs that they shouldn't have been singing, you know, didn't like it.
7258446	7261487	Of course, shock, settle that in court.
7261887	7263749	Oh my god, you don't say.
7263829	7266412	Another lawsuit in the gaming industry settled out of court.
7266512	7267734	Get out now.
7268134	7268415	I know.
7269656	7270237	They've settled.
7270998	7271378	That's it.
7273240	7274842	No word on the settlement.
7275002	7277104	As usual, no word on who got what.
7277385	7277545	Yeah.
7280201	7282142	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
7282642	7284223	Every week you guys send us emails.
7285643	7291726	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com We dive into the mailbag and pick out a few emails that we think we should read on air.
7292746	7294007	So let's open up the mailbag.
7296068	7296588	Hello?
7296608	7298449	Hello?
7299509	7300289	Where's the emails?
7300329	7300550	Hello?
7300790	7301250	Hello?
7303825	7306530	Oh, there's no emails in the mailbag this week.
7307271	7310618	So even if DarkSakura was here, there'd be nothing to read.
7311459	7312221	Womp womp.
7313690	7314331	DarkSakura.com
7357250	7358132	Loki, why don't you start?
7358934	7361320	I don't really have an FU of the week.
7361380	7364508	I guess an FU to not being able to play Borderlands 2.
7365270	7366332	I want to play that this week.
7368403	7371145	My FU of the week goes to the listeners for not sending us any email.
7371825	7376428	Unless you voted for us in one of the podcast award things, then you're forgiven if you did that, I suppose.
7376888	7378409	But FU to that.
7379389	7380850	That's a not so serious FU.
7381350	7387514	Otherwise, I would say an FU to just all the money I've spent on this rocky project.
7388314	7390976	It's pretty disgusting, but you know what?
7391436	7394938	It's a community I really love, and I'm excited to see it back in town.
7394998	7401642	So just F you to nerves and the realization that, like, oh my god, this is happening in, like, five days.
7401702	7405084	Like, I'm just, like, freaking out a little bit, but it'll be good.
7406445	7406925	It'll be good.
7408206	7408586	It'll be good.
7410751	7416854	All right, let's get to a couple more news stories, then we'll take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7417234	7417474	Loki.
7417954	7427999	All right, so now we talked about it last week, how there was the oh, so wonderful promotion that Microsoft is doing tied with your gamer score where you got a 1% or 2% kickback.
7428079	7429180	Woo-hoo!
7429740	7430500	1% kickback.
7430841	7432181	That's fantastic.
7432721	7433182	Well, Sony...
7434022	7438505	Side to up the deal a little bit because, you know, they think 1% is not necessarily good enough.
7438866	7439806	So here's what they're going to do.
7440807	7450214	They announced that apparently if you buy $100 or more in October, you're going to get a $20 voucher for the PlayStation Network in November.
7452136	7452456	Not bad.
7453176	7454757	That's enough to buy Tokyo Jungle.
7455338	7458380	And a lot of games online, actually.
7458440	7458660	That's 20%.
7459141	7460562	That's 10 times better than 2%.
7461122	7463424	Does the money I spend on PlayStation Plus count towards that?
7468037	7468197	No.
7469778	7472959	Well, they said just on PlayStation Network, so maybe?
7473920	7474860	Maybe that would count?
7475621	7482544	But, you know, you can buy... I mean, I think it's kind of to push you a little bit to... And this is kind of cool.
7482564	7486666	If you're thinking on the fence about the digital stuff, remember you can buy those digital games.
7486746	7491288	If you have PlayStation Plus, you get 10% off of the digital games, plus you get $20 back.
7491348	7496310	So that could really cut down the cost of these new release games if you're interested in picking up about $100 worth of product.
7497231	7497331	So...
7498012	7504775	Actdeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, I got 20 Microsoft points for my birthday from Microsoft.
7505555	7507176	A whole 20 points?
7507816	7509237	That is a whole quarter.
7509757	7510558	That's what your birthday is.
7510598	7511678	There's the quarter.
7511978	7513899	That's what the special birthday thing was.
7514579	7515860	20 Microsoft points.
7515900	7517041	You know what that will buy?
7517501	7517781	Nothing.
7517821	7519161	Not a goddamn thing.
7520042	7522003	All that will do is that will bug you.
7522783	7526185	It'd be like someone went into your house in the middle of the night.
7527766	7531947	and plucked out one of those pixels in your TV and made it not work.
7532087	7536169	And it's just going to fucking bother you because you're going to have 20 points left over.
7536189	7538430	You're like, fuck, I can't buy anything with these 20 points.
7538750	7540510	I need to purchase more points to buy stuff.
7540550	7551034	It's just going to drive you crazy until you put more money in and then still end up with 120 points left over or some other freaking multiple of something you'll never be able to spend.
7551354	7555315	You can buy, according to Dark Tetsuya, you could buy one quarter of Bungie Ferret Tossing.
7556946	7561390	which is a $1 game and a great deal on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace right now.
7563952	7564092	Ooh.
7564873	7566174	Oh, Microsoft, you're so generous.
7566214	7567715	So $20 does sound a lot better.
7567735	7568676	I couldn't even give you a buck.
7568696	7570037	I can give you a dollar.
7570617	7571418	It's fake money.
7573929	7580136	Now, $100 on the PlayStation Marketplace, that seems like a lot of money to spend, but... If you're buying new release games.
7580356	7580756	Exactly.
7580796	7582498	All it takes is two new release games, right?
7582939	7587524	Or even one new release game and maybe three PlayStation Network games to get you there.
7588745	7591988	I wonder if PlayStation Plus dollars count towards that.
7592049	7592569	Probably not.
7593890	7615488	um if you have PlayStation Plus or if you buy PlayStation Plus if you buy PlayStation Plus uh maybe like maybe maybe this is my month to renew uh I don't know maybe I'd be interested to know that to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase quarter
7615854	7622996	All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we're going to open up the Skype line for calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7623376	7632519	This doesn't have to do with gaming per se, but I think this is a good story because obviously gaming owes a lot of thanks to this, and that is the anniversary that we celebrate this week.
7633359	7639341	The compact disc turns 30, or the CD is now 30 years old.
7639741	7642042	Yes, Loki, you and I are older than the CD.
7644022	7644962	The CD was a joint effort of Philips and Sony.
7644982	7647043	They were working independently on different versions of the technology in the 70s.
7665331	7675415	and they started to come out right in June of 1985 was when the CD-ROM was really born and that, of course, led to where we're at now.
7676015	7684799	And, of course, without the CD, we would never have had the PlayStation era or really arguably DVDs and Blu-ray and all the stuff we have now.
7684839	7688420	I mean, DVDs and Blu-rays still are shaped like a CD.
7689400	7689881	There you go.
7691181	7703239	and of course it was a great sound remember the whole big thing about it was like you can skip right to tracks like no more rewinding and fast forwarding I think you could skip to tracks on 8 tracks but you still had to rewind them at some point
7705638	7708099	I just remembered the giant buttons that were 1, 2, 3, and 4.
7710099	7710499	Oh, boy.
7710659	7712760	Oh, this leads to a great question in chat.
7712780	7714320	I love where Tigerclaw is going for this.
7714780	7717160	Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line and we'll tackle this question.
7717180	7720141	1-877-GAME-OLR Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7721021	7728323	While we wait for some calls, Tigerclaw in chat says, Do you guys remember the first CD you ever bought and still have?
7729063	7733424	Tigerclaw says, My very first CD was the Too Unlimited album called No Limit.
7735521	7736082	VIRGIN MEGA STORE
7758560	7760744	I don't remember what my first CD was.
7761425	7763649	I sorta remember my first CD player.
7764350	7766193	I had a tape adapter for my car.
7768377	7770380	But yeah, I don't even remember what my first CD was.
7771846	7776610	Well, okay, I don't really have a first CD because I bought two CDs when I first went.
7777951	7781775	And one of them was the soundtrack to The Addams Family, which came out that year.
7782255	7783236	And I love that movie.
7783316	7785778	So I bought that even though it was mostly orchestral.
7786098	7786839	I remember having that.
7787279	7789281	But then here you go.
7789321	7789921	You ready for this?
7789982	7791143	It was another soundtrack.
7791223	7794325	And here's one of my big gay moments.
7794345	7795706	You ready?
7795786	7798409	One of my first CDs was the soundtrack to Sister Act.
7798429	7798509	Okay.
7799741	7806544	That's right, the Whoopi Goldberg classic was one of the first CDs I ever owned.
7807944	7814046	I don't still have them though, which is kind of tragic because I got rid of all my CDs during one of my moves.
7814626	7815467	So, kind of sad.
7816427	7819809	Uh, let's see, I'm going to, uh, the chat to check out some of these answers.
7820350	7824412	Uh, DJ Dark Knight says, my first ever CD was Dr. Dre, The Chronic.
7824852	7826453	See, there's nothing to be embarrassed about there.
7826613	7827334	That's like a classic album.
7827354	7830836	Actually, no, I remember what my first CDs were, because they weren't actually my CDs.
7830896	7833778	My parents, they bought a new stereo system that had a CD player.
7834258	7838981	So we had, uh, one of the first CDs we had was, uh...
7841004	7841964	Michael Jackson, Black and White.
7843465	7843965	Oh, yeah.
7844385	7846206	That was like a landmark song when that came out.
7846466	7847686	Again, our Skype line is open.
7847706	7849226	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7849266	7850547	That album wasn't Black and White.
7850887	7851407	What was it called?
7851607	7852047	Dangerous.
7852107	7852708	Dangerous, yes.
7852868	7853228	Dangerous.
7853248	7854268	That was it.
7854288	7855048	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7855108	7856569	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
7856829	7858229	Let's get to some embarrassing answers.
7858769	7862250	Ranma in chat says, My first CD was the Aqua Barbie Girl single.
7865014	7865315	Love it.
7866095	7866536	Let's see.
7868097	7871299	Ziba says, I think mine was either Ace of Base or No Doubt.
7872821	7875343	Some answers that you can't really be embarrassed about.
7875743	7877845	Actdeft says, my first CD was an Aerosmith album.
7878385	7880887	Orange Right says, Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise.
7882048	7885831	Alan Alchemy remembers buying CDs for other people were the first CDs he bought.
7886151	7892276	The Wayne's World soundtrack, Primus was Sailing the Seas of Cheese, Weezer's debut, and Madonna's Erotica.
7894599	7895040	Let's see.
7895420	7899326	Zether says my first CD was Weird Al's The Food Album.
7900788	7901089	Awesome.
7903914	7906235	Well, I need to load up the Twitter.
7906255	7909337	I forgot to get out my iPad, so I guess I'll have to do this the regular way.
7909817	7912478	See if there's any tweets tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.
7912498	7914099	I know TigerClaw usually sends us a couple.
7914119	7915239	I'll see if there's anything else in there.
7915920	7917200	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
7918501	7919301	No, I don't.
7919782	7920242	Yikes!
7920402	7922123	At least nothing I've seen so far.
7923003	7923103	Hmm...
7929542	7931703	Alright, well, I got some tweets while you find it.
7932183	7932503	Let's see.
7933743	7937225	From Codeman asks, Did you guys find a host?
7938505	7938685	Nope.
7939906	7941946	We could do the Skype host thing, but I don't know.
7942006	7945648	Like, a lot of this show, you have to remember the history of this show, we've always been in one room together.
7946068	7950509	So, you know, whereas taking calls on Skype is one thing, to have the host on Skype is weird.
7950569	7951289	To me, anyway.
7951730	7957972	I understand Tiara's filled in when I'm not here, and that's different, because Jamie emcees those shows, so...
7958832	7981956	that works out a lot better but uh yeah i don't know the not being able to see the co-host thing is is weird for me but then again horde house works okay i can't explain it i can't it's just olr's got a formula you gotta stick to it uh moving on to some tweets from tiger claw uh tiger claw oh reminds me of something that happened in world of warcraft today i did not experience this but i heard about it apparently and they're blaming this on a hacker
7982276	7983477	Yeah, I just was reading that.
8008187	8009788	and the subsequent graveyards.
8010388	8013150	So yeah, crazy stuff.
8013330	8019793	No official comment from Blizzard, but I will say the servers were down and then the authentication servers were down as well for quite a bit this morning.
8019833	8021173	I tried to play around 11 a.m.
8021193	8021654	and I couldn't.
8022134	8024495	So I think they were trying to fix this as it was happening.
8025295	8026776	I'm sure Blizzard's seen this.
8026836	8032519	They certainly follow the fan sites and I can't believe everybody and their mother wasn't filing a complaint about the characters.
8032939	8036041	So they will find the IPs and they will obliterate them.
8037061	8037762	Thank you for watching!
8057211	8058492	You got shy listeners tonight.
8058992	8060593	Or does the number not work?
8060713	8063594	I don't know what's happening there.
8063614	8064954	1-877-GAME-OLR again.
8065014	8067375	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8068876	8072997	Let me make sure the number's working tonight because that was the problem last week.
8073037	8074738	What is wrong with this thing, man?
8075198	8078359	Angry Birds Star Wars Jenga?
8078379	8081080	That's like a three-way crossover there.
8083226	8086188	Let's just throw everything and see if one of them sticks.
8088750	8090811	Because Star Wars needed more Angry Birds.
8090872	8097876	I don't know if we mentioned this, Atlas is publishing all the Calypso stuff now.
8098257	8098517	Really?
8098977	8099257	Yeah.
8100058	8100578	I didn't know that.
8101759	8102480	Yeah, that's kind of weird.
8102900	8104001	Or distributing, maybe.
8105268	8107731	This other link here from Tigerclaw is kind of sad.
8107831	8108873	Oh, we got a call coming in.
8109574	8110215	This should be interesting.
8110255	8111637	Let's go to the phones.
8112157	8113199	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8113219	8113639	Who's this?
8114340	8115402	Does your Skype work yet?
8115462	8116323	Yes, it works.
8116784	8120329	I called it from my phone and just verified the 800 number was working.
8122100	8122981	Yeah, it's working.
8123141	8123781	This is Bobby.
8123821	8124662	This is your opening act.
8124802	8127763	Of course, our co-headliner.
8127803	8128844	How are you, Bobby Blackwolf?
8129204	8129764	I'm doing good.
8131525	8136148	I've been in your position where I'm sitting there asking for calls, so I figured I'd help you guys out.
8136488	8137709	I appreciate it.
8137969	8140070	You've always been very good.
8140150	8142592	You've literally had us on every episode of your show.
8143012	8145354	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8163351	8163871	That's right.
8163911	8168333	I was at Siege this weekend, which is the Southern Interactive Entertainment and Game Expo.
8168773	8171374	Think of it more like GDC rather than E3.
8172295	8176977	But it was basically, you know, a lot of students were there about getting into the industry and things like that.
8176997	8177797	And it was really interesting.
8177817	8179798	Got to meet a lot of great indie artists.
8180658	8188882	and developers primarily here in the southeast and hopefully lined up some stuff for us to cover in the future here at VOG.
8189383	8192404	So I'm really excited about that and a lot of people are really excited about VOG.
8192424	8197967	It's one of the first times I've really pushed VOG as a network really hard on people.
8198187	8199568	And one of our first times in print.
8199808	8203050	I saw the tweet with the little logo in the flyer.
8203330	8206131	It's the program.
8206151	8209593	That's actually the program that everybody got and probably didn't read.
8210601	8211842	That happens, that's alright.
8212062	8214985	No, actually they all did read it because that had the schedule of all the panels.
8215266	8218489	And I heard the VOG logo was above the Microsoft logo.
8218569	8219029	It is.
8219190	8219830	Amazing.
8220251	8220511	Yes.
8220731	8221992	We're coming for you, Gates.
8222493	8223074	That's right.
8223334	8225416	You had a pretty neat interview tonight on your show.
8227206	8229388	Tonight I was talking to Dustin Klingman.
8229468	8235153	He is the chairman of the International Game Developers Association.
8235253	8237896	You were talking about that I've done some interesting episodes.
8237916	8241138	I've started trying to theme what I'm doing instead of just talking about the news.
8241799	8247544	If there's a theme I can do, and if it's more like a discussion topic, I'll talk about it.
8247644	8252948	A couple weeks ago, I did a whole theme on people getting laid off.
8253735	8256018	and I'm tired of talking about people getting laid off.
8256519	8260844	He did his keynote speech at Siege about a time for optimism.
8261787	8284371	and it was talking about how you should be optimistic about the game industry in spite of and he actually put out 120 studios have closed in the last 5 or 6 years that's the official number 120 have closed in the last 5 or 6 years and all this stuff people are leaving Zynga's stock price dropped and he did this entire keynote about why you should still be optimistic
8285594	8291266	I interviewed him and basically tried to distill his one-hour keynote into a little 25-minute interview.
8291686	8294553	But I basically asked him, why should we be optimistic?
8296030	8297171	and just let him talk.
8297552	8300995	And one of the questions you asked him was about the video game Crash as well.
8301055	8305520	And you kind of asked, do you think we'll see something like we saw in the early 80s happen again?
8305560	8306521	And he said no.
8306641	8308764	And he had his reasons.
8308864	8313449	As a consumer, I'm not sure I necessarily agreed with everything he said.
8313749	8314390	But I get the...
8315811	8323536	I get the optimism and the fact that, you know, kind of like for every door that closes another opens and that there's this whole mobile thing is now the fad, I guess.
8324056	8328059	And maybe we're seeing kind of like less AAA things and more mobile things.
8328579	8329100	But I don't know.
8329160	8337405	I kind of wonder, like, part of the reason the Atari 2600 and all that collapsed was that you had this oversaturation of these little...
8337825	8343491	Games, although granted they were charging full price for them at the time and mobile games are more in the $0.99, $2 size.
8344573	8352061	And his thing was that the reason also the crash happened is because stores just stopped wanting to carry them because they couldn't return them.
8353158	8353979	The Evil G doesn't sell.
8369385	8369805	NautiBear2
8387463	8388423	Let me jump in with Loki.
8388483	8392004	Loki, the man who works for the distribution company, you say that's not totally true.
8392044	8392365	That's not true.
8392385	8393285	It's all one-way sale.
8393805	8395085	They do not allow returns.
8396726	8398366	Is that maybe just your arrangement?
8398666	8400607	No, I think it's mass retailers.
8400707	8408249	And the reason why they do that, that's why they do a pre-order program because otherwise they can buy a bunch of stuff and then return it all.
8408309	8409430	But it's all one way.
8409730	8412130	I think what it is now is they get a lot more perks.
8412170	8416972	They get a lot more back-end rebates and a lot of price protections and all that fun stuff.
8417572	8441280	but uh no it's definitely there are no returns on that stuff because the publishers do not want to be sitting on that stuff interesting and is that why amazon isn't that part of the like the rumors why amazon stopped carrying a lot of the nintendo stuff right the hardware uh well defectives are a little different but yeah once again you have to usually what they'll do with the effectives is they'll want the cut the consumer to go through the proper routes through the publishers but
8441840	8448105	or the hardware manufacturers like, you know, they want a person that buys an Xbox 360 to go to Microsoft and have that repaired it.
8448505	8450586	But, you know, a consumer doesn't care.
8450606	8452948	They're like, well, why did GameStop sell me a defective system?
8452968	8458952	I'm going to go back to GameStop and return it instead of actually, you know, even if there's instructions in the box, do not return this back to the retailer.
8459692	8467678	So, of course, all that stuff has to be approved, you know, and obviously, you know, they're going to approve GameStop over, you know, some mom-off shop.
8467698	8470740	I wish I knew that when I was doing the interview yesterday so I could have, like, called them out on it.
8471880	8474561	Oh, well, now we'll just have to have another interview at some point.
8474881	8476882	Or we'll invite him on OLR, let Loki grill him.
8478263	8482104	No, but it was a good interview, and the fact that he was pretty open.
8482745	8488567	You did have some tough questions, and that's always great when an interviewee can handle those questions.
8489147	8491728	All right, so I have to ask you about something you didn't talk about.
8492189	8492429	Okay.
8492569	8496270	But you did talk about it on Twitter, so that's why I know it's fair game, because you did post about it on Twitter.
8497191	8500072	You've got to tell me about what's happening with a certain voice actor.
8500772	8501253	Oh god.
8502133	8502954	What's up with this?
8503374	8511621	So I, well, and actually I phrased it on my Facebook, my private Facebook profile a little bit better.
8513322	8520228	Because, you know, my friends on Facebook know why this is amazing a little bit more than what people on Twitter would do.
8520588	8524231	But I will tell you this, I am not the type of person to go near a dance floor.
8525851	8538347	and so I don't you know but I like you know going to concerts and stuff so I'm you know because I'm a musician so I'm actually watching the musician and so I've actually never been really you know on a dance floor you know
8539982	8543264	Usually I can get out of being pulled onto a dance floor.
8543284	8544764	And Professor Shy Guy was playing.
8545325	8547086	All those years of DDR did nothing?
8547606	8547826	No.
8548366	8550207	You gotta realize, I did an aero stomp.
8550607	8551167	Alright, alright.
8551368	8553208	My Bimani was fingers.
8553389	8554409	You were a Beatmania guy.
8554469	8555149	Okay, fair enough.
8556090	8556290	So...
8558755	8559675	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8578762	8582884	and, you know, so she got pulled up to the dance floor by somebody.
8583805	8584925	And, you know, so I'm kind of sitting there.
8584945	8587467	I actually have some pictures of her dancing up there, which is great.
8588387	8592089	And then he's like, okay, everybody here go out and get somebody and Ellen McClain comes right to me.
8593933	8608899	and she's like come on and I'm like you know I do the whole no thing and she gives me this look like the motherly you're gonna do this I said so look you and when the voice of GLaDOS comes up to you and like just kind of like stares at you
8609739	8614000	saying you're going to do this and starts pulling, you don't resist.
8614080	8615420	You don't say no to GLaDOS.
8615500	8617521	You don't.
8617661	8626543	So the way I phrase it is I don't know what's more impressive, the fact that I got on a dance floor and danced for two songs or that it was by the voice of GLaDOS.
8627883	8628843	That's a great story.
8629583	8629863	Love it.
8630383	8632764	And thankfully, there's no video of it.
8634198	8635019	And there never will.
8635039	8636661	I have no clue what I'm doing up there.
8636701	8637522	And she was trying.
8637562	8639905	I mean, she actually like she was wearing kind of like this.
8640565	8644009	I don't even know what the clothing thing is called, but it's something that she wears over her shoulders.
8645010	8647673	She was actually using that and wrapping it around me and doing something.
8647693	8647773	Yeah.
8648054	8648755	Whoa.
8649275	8649816	Yeah, I know.
8649916	8651317	John Patrick Lauer, you're on notice.
8651478	8651678	Whoa.
8652919	8657201	This is like getting to be Dancing with the Stars level scandal right here.
8657521	8658641	Yes.
8658801	8663863	Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Ellen made Black Wolf his slave for science.
8663883	8665244	I think you meant her slave.
8665264	8665784	Yeah, her.
8666124	8666484	Her slave.
8666504	8667224	She's definitely a woman.
8667424	8667645	Yes.
8668665	8669145	Definitely.
8669505	8670125	For science.
8671126	8673167	And then he said, okay, everybody go out and get more.
8673267	8676968	So she took me by the hand and we found two other people.
8678008	8680069	And then she handed me off to the other woman.
8680990	8681850	And she took the, yeah.
8682486	8683107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8709602	8710042	Thanks for watching!
8731124	8732225	GameCon Dance GameCon Dance
8757882	8762324	I plan to walk up to her and go, and I'll just say, hey, I'm a friend of Bobby Blackwolf's.
8762905	8763425	There you go.
8764205	8765686	She does know that name now.
8766146	8767187	She does remember that.
8769128	8771069	We've met three times, so she now knows me.
8771109	8771729	There you go.
8772529	8774730	Now all the listeners are going to try that at a convention.
8775131	8775671	Don't you dare.
8777586	8780050	You could tell her that you heard her on VOG Network.
8780070	8780791	There you go.
8780931	8785998	Because she did, and I know I told you this, and we haven't started putting these on the stream.
8786759	8791666	She did multiple bumpers for VOG on Saturday.
8792747	8793088	Amazing.
8793128	8793669	Multiple.
8793729	8794470	She did three of them.
8795717	8800623	Don't vote for my show, vote for Orange Lounge Radio.
8800643	8802184	I was at the top of Bobby's list, I'm sure, Loki.
8802204	8802745	You dummy.
8815646	8817407	I didn't ever do a bumper for me.
8817467	8818847	It was a bumper for VOG.
8819668	8821648	Because I find I promote the whole network.
8821729	8823609	Yes, exactly, as we've been saying.
8824210	8827851	Even if you're not going to vote for us, vote VOG.
8827871	8829892	Oh, I like the ring for that.
8829992	8830532	Vote VOG.
8831492	8832233	There you go.
8832273	8834234	Why didn't we think of that when it started on October 1st?
8834314	8834634	Damn it.
8835114	8836014	We still have a few days left.
8836034	8836855	We have until the 15th.
8837155	8839176	Frisbee in chat says, Ellen bumped for VOG.
8840936	8841156	Yeah.
8841917	8842377	Amazing.
8842921	8861606	alright well Bobby thank you for sharing your stories from SiegeCon and of course you got more interviews coming up throughout the week on your own show which I can't believe anybody who's listened to OLR at this point hasn't heard your show at one point or another but if for some crazy ass reason they have still not heard your show how can they find you Bobby?
8863327	8870229	VOGnetwork.com is actually where I point everybody to go to my episodes now yeah we do that for Horde House and OLR too
8871107	8871508	Great.
8884548	8887569	and the upcoming coming up shows next week.
8887629	8890411	I have a live interview with the game recruiter.
8891551	8894273	He actually is the CEO of GameRecruiter.com, Mark Mencher.
8894933	8903097	He is going to be taking live chat questions as well about getting into the industry, but I'm also going to ask him how you can stay at your job and what needs to happen to stop all these layoffs.
8903597	8905818	He doesn't know I'm going to ask him that yet, but I'm going to run it by him.
8907780	8930099	and then I've got a couple pre-recorded interviews I'm going to be playing throughout the next couple weeks Tom Buscaglia who is the game attorney so we have the game recruiter and then the next week the game attorney from GameAttorney.com he mostly works he's mostly general counsel to a lot of independent game developers and indie game developers and he works with
8931460	8932020	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8951240	8951720	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8978666	8979166	Very cool.
8979266	8982647	So that's all the fun stuff coming up on the Bobby Blackwolf show.
8983167	8986868	And then hopefully I'll be doing more themed stuff as well.
8987308	8988929	What big interviews do we have coming up, Loki?
8989349	8992470	What do we have to compete with Bobby here on Orange Laundry?
8992730	8994631	What big interviews have we landed for the rest of the year?
8996531	8996971	Let's see.
8997011	9001833	Well, next week we've got Cliffy B and Miyamoto's the week after that.
9003733	9006035	Oh, I do want to, can I throw one more thing in?
9006075	9006976	Can I take one more minute?
9007176	9007816	I suppose.
9008397	9018284	Okay, so when I got there Friday, I saw the Microsoft booth, and it was the Windows 8 developer booth, and, you know, the guy behind it, and I was like, so, what do you do?
9018324	9023468	He's like, oh, I'm the developer evangelist for Windows mobile programming and Windows 8 programming and blah, blah, blah.
9023488	9026790	I'm like, oh, so can I ask you something about Xbox Live Indie games?
9027771	9027971	Oh.
9028171	9028872	Like, sure.
9028892	9028972	Sure.
9029898	9032639	And I'm like, so, blah, blah, blah, prepaid codes, blah, blah, blah.
9032719	9036200	And I basically go through the whole thing about the prepaid codes that I know you guys covered as well.
9037500	9038560	Oh, I hadn't heard of that.
9038600	9040441	Was that like a developer here that's having problems?
9040481	9041901	I'm like, no, it's every developer.
9042021	9043842	No, it's the entirety of the internet.
9044102	9044302	Yes.
9045262	9052104	And he's like, I have not heard of that, but if you give me more information about it, I will start an email chain inside Microsoft.
9052244	9053065	And I'm like, okay.
9053105	9057846	And so I found his Twitter, and I tweeted him the link to our article, and I'm like, it's been three weeks and counting.
9059428	9071097	We actually got a comment on our site from one of the other independent developers that actually posted a statement about how he's stopping support for all Microsoft platforms until they fix the prepaid code issue.
9071277	9074419	Are you saying VOG Network may save Xbox Live Indie games?
9074780	9075400	I hope so.
9075520	9076341	That would be amazing.
9077264	9079265	because nobody else writing about this except me.
9079685	9079985	Weird.
9080726	9082066	But we got Reddit love from it.
9082807	9083067	Love it.
9083867	9092672	All right, well, Bobby, we should let you go to see if anybody else is going to take a chance on calling in tonight, but I'm really glad you did have an opportunity, whatever the reason, to come on the show and plug all the good stuff you're doing right now.
9093612	9095133	I just wanted to test your Skype, actually.
9095293	9095893	All right, well, it works.
9095913	9097194	And I like the pop filters.
9098106	9098306	Yeah.
9098406	9098846	Oh, do you?
9099406	9099707	Yeah.
9099927	9104148	Some of the new stuff, our new toys, we all have the same mic now, too.
9104268	9109230	I don't know if that was out there before, but we used to have three different microphones, two different types of connections.
9109270	9112951	It was all different, but now everything is the same.
9113351	9114112	You guys are growing up.
9114312	9116052	And a condenser mic in the studio now.
9116532	9116812	Ooh.
9117073	9117313	Ooh.
9117493	9119133	I did that for the voiceover in the intro.
9119153	9120254	That's why it sounds a little different.
9121214	9121594	Awesome.
9121714	9121934	All right.
9122254	9122694	Take care, Bobby.
9123235	9123555	Take care.
9123575	9123895	All right.
9123915	9124075	Bye.
9125492	9127974	Thanks again to Brad from PodCulture because I know he's listening.
9127994	9128655	They're fantastic.
9128975	9129595	What, the mics?
9129755	9130016	Yeah.
9130296	9130956	Oh yeah, they're great.
9131437	9132538	And plus I color-coded them.
9132558	9132978	Did you notice?
9133198	9135120	They're the same colors that they are in the show role.
9135240	9137802	I have a green one, you have a blue one, and she's going to have a pink one.
9137882	9138963	Nice.
9139163	9140624	Which she'll hate, but oh well.
9140864	9146109	Now we need to get the fancy, like you know how they have the blocks on there that have the network logo and stuff?
9146609	9147690	Yes, we could do that.
9149011	9150372	That's cheesy and stuff, but sure.
9151492	9156755	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9157415	9160356	The only thing, I got to find the stand for this condenser mic.
9160416	9161457	He sent everything.
9161477	9163318	I got to find my old condenser mic.
9163458	9165319	I have a condenser mic somewhere.
9165379	9166519	I don't even know where the hell it is.
9166599	9167220	And you know what?
9167340	9169961	That condenser mic and this condenser mic both have the same problem.
9170001	9172282	They have crazy ass gain on them.
9172822	9173563	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9189640	9199325	And then the good news is, because he sent us all those mics, these mics aren't bad that we have, so it'll be a great mobile kit so we can set up a better way to do OLR on the go.
9199345	9204868	All right, we'll give it one more chance for calls, and then I'm going to shut it down and close out the show.
9204888	9208270	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9208590	9212612	I did have another tweet topic that Tiger Claw sent.
9213152	9215153	It's not a great story, though.
9215193	9218115	It's kind of one of those, this is really unfortunate, but I will...
9218975	9220738	I will go ahead and share it with you guys here.
9221098	9222700	This is somewhat local, too.
9222740	9228727	This happened in Hercules, California, which is one of those towns you pass going to the Bay Area before you hit the Bay Bridge in Oakland and all that.
9229228	9235396	Well, unfortunately, the mother of Neversoft concept artist Simon Coe was murdered.
9235896	9237016	That's really tragic.
9237877	9247319	ABC News 7 was reporting that Susie Ko was found in her home Friday evening while the family's sky-blue 2011 Subaru Outback is also missing.
9247659	9249920	The police have no motive or suspects in the death.
9250220	9257042	They are asking anyone in the area with information to call the police 510-724-1111.
9257102	9258402	That's very tragic.
9258442	9259603	I'm really sorry to hear about that.
9260483	9263004	We have a call coming in, so let's take the call.
9263064	9264084	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9264104	9264424	Who's this?
9265626	9266566	Hey, it's Actdeft.
9266647	9267367	Hey, Actdeft.
9267387	9268087	What's on your mind, buddy?
9269948	9270609	Nothing much.
9271149	9276952	I was also trying to call you earlier to test your Skype, but it seems it works.
9277312	9278052	Yep, it works.
9278513	9279033	Hooray.
9279173	9281394	Well, what have you been playing lately?
9282635	9286137	Well, actually, I do have a topic in mind.
9286537	9286737	Oh, okay.
9286757	9289658	Especially with a game that came today.
9289678	9291459	Mm-hmm.
9291499	9292080	Pokemon.
9293040	9294241	It actually has gotten...
9295436	9298879	Reviews below 8, but it hasn't been below 7.
9299399	9302361	It's around the 7th or 8th mark.
9303402	9310707	But it's something that has bugged me since I started reading and probably writing reviews.
9313149	9317753	It's that any game below 8 is automatically bad.
9318673	9319454	It's stable like that.
9321047	9321848	Why do you think that is?
9323811	9325154	And I don't know why.
9325174	9330963	It's something that the whole internet is like, oh my god, it got a 7, it's bad.
9331684	9332585	I don't understand that.
9334128	9334849	I really don't get it.
9336104	9339807	Well, that's what leads to this whole artificial inflation of gamer scores, too.
9339887	9341108	I'm not talking about the Xbox kind.
9341148	9342589	I'm talking about review scores.
9342729	9347433	An average game, an okay game, should be a 5, shouldn't it?
9347993	9349895	But that's really not the way it is.
9350035	9352277	Average games in this day and age tend to get a 7.
9352337	9354198	If you give a game a 5, it's a stinker.
9354658	9362885	That's why at VOG Network we prefer to use the grading scale that you have from high schools and stuff because the A to F scale is a little more realistic.
9363405	9366348	But here's why I think 7s also feel really harsh.
9367048	9369951	How much are they charging for Pokemon Black 2 White 2?
9370011	9371432	Aren't these like $40 games?
9373333	9374014	$35, I think.
9374034	9374014	$35.
9374114	9376696	Okay, well, still, that's a big chunk of change.
9377097	9378578	Yeah, that's a high end on a DS game.
9378678	9383122	And most games that are reviewed for the console systems, you're talking $50, $60 games.
9383562	9387986	When you're going to drop that much money on a game, are you going to drop $60 on something average?
9390359	9402732	Well, it depends because if the game is fun, if the game will accomplish what it's set for, to be entertaining, it should be worth it.
9404214	9405195	At least in my opinion.
9406196	9406416	Right.
9408804	9409946	Thank you for watching!
9425467	9450518	But he was telling me that there's some online title that was released That in some ways, I guess it was only three bucks in the 3DS eShop And in some ways it's better than the actual Pokemon game that came out today Just with some of the ways it's different and so forth Let me see, hopefully he won't mind if I read a little bit of the message here The relevant parts here, what is it?
9452199	9452819	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9477433	9477853	You get.
9477953	9487444	So sounds like in some ways the $3 title might be providing as much value as the $35 title and that's an issue.
9488045	9489567	But of course that's one person's opinion.
9490717	9494439	No, like I said, it can be entertaining.
9494479	9500383	The price in this case is that you're paying for a full... It's supposed to be a full game.
9500843	9501083	Right.
9501663	9513950	At least that you're going to be playing at least for, I don't know, 20 hours that you can probably play a Pokemon game in that time and beat it to an extent.
9514771	9518733	So I do get the value of...
9519994	9522817	and how much of a replay you're going to get.
9522857	9533646	But like I said, if the game is entertaining, if you can enjoy it, then it shouldn't be labeled as bad, especially with a 7.
9533707	9534647	It should be an average.
9535188	9542715	And I do get why the game might get that score, but telling people that it's a bad game...
9545305	9557988	It's like if I were saying that a certain game, I won't name any game in particular, but, oh, it has good graphics, it has good music, and it's fun.
9558488	9563429	Oh, but it has some very bad flaws, and it has some bugs.
9563769	9564849	But overall, it's good.
9564909	9572171	But, oh, I'm going to give it a 3, for example, instead of a 7 or a 6, probably, that it should get.
9572191	9572271	Yeah.
9572851	9594296	is it may be bad in a relative sense where you know this game is getting review scores that are lower than the other Pokemon games so either a people are feeling burnout or b it's not a bad game per se but it's a bad Pokemon game because all the other Pokemon games are so good and this one's you know not really the best in the series
9595016	9603545	Probably a former, since most people have been talking about that, that the gameplay has gotten pretty repetitive.
9604466	9608370	It hasn't changed, but then again, if it isn't broke, why fix it?
9609580	9610381	I guess that's true.
9611543	9613385	Alright, Actdeft, anything else you want to say tonight?
9614867	9615468	No, nothing.
9615788	9618531	Just expect a few, well, a little plug here.
9619192	9627903	Just expect a few little new articles from I Love That Song, especially since Halloween is coming, so it'll be fun.
9628724	9637713	Yep, I'm behind on posting articles, but I know you've got some great stuff in the queue, and when all this other mess in my life is over, I'll be able to focus on that again, so it'll be great.
9638794	9639574	Don't worry about that.
9639995	9642657	It'll get done eventually.
9642878	9643798	Yes, it will.
9643818	9644799	I won't let it fall off the radar.
9645080	9645960	Alright, you take care, buddy.
9645980	9646541	Thanks for calling.
9647222	9647842	You too, thanks.
9650481	9655604	Alright, 1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio if anybody else wants to call in.
9656624	9657965	Are you out of stuff to talk about, Loki?
9657985	9659666	I can't remember if you had anything else left.
9661927	9665369	I was just looking at some of the stuff, just going through different websites and stuff.
9665589	9672872	Apparently in the manual for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, they have an advertisement for the Pokedex 3D Pro.
9673373	9676774	It's coming November 8th and for $15 on the eShop.
9678268	9681050	That's why the old one's no longer available.
9681190	9682691	It all makes sense now.
9684412	9684933	I see.
9686414	9689916	See over 640 Pokemon in full 3D.
9689976	9691297	Yeah, that's worth 15 bucks.
9691457	9692538	Fuck you, Nintendo.
9695860	9697141	There was another thing I saw.
9697201	9700323	There was another hack on the Vita, actually.
9701464	9704606	Because I do follow Dash Hacks and they post that stuff.
9705186	9705447	It's been...
9706287	9714130	Not patched, but they removed the game that had the exploit for it, but it allowed people to run a custom firmware for the PSP on their Vita.
9714190	9720412	So they can run a custom firmware for 6.6, and it'll actually allow you to run ISOs for the PSP and stuff.
9720832	9727534	But of course, they've removed that game off of the PlayStation Store, so you can't get it.
9728135	9731656	And unfortunately, that was the whole issue where there was some...
9732136	9732496	All right.
9751989	9756792	Well, it is 9 o'clock, and it looks like no more calls are coming in, so I guess we're going to close up the Skype line.
9757493	9771503	Thanks to those that did call in tonight, and if you think of something a little later on, you can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, or of course there is always Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, or our Facebook community at facebook.com slash orangeloungeradio.
9772063	9772723	DarkSakura.com
9801011	9803232	and who knows what will happen in gaming this week.
9803252	9806254	We're starting to ramp up into that really busy holiday time of year.
9806694	9811437	So out of all those games coming out, it'll be interesting to see which ones we play.
9811757	9815859	And by this time next week, this play stuff I'm doing will be over with.
9815879	9819201	So I'll be able to kind of focus on this stuff again, which will be great.
9820602	9822983	Loki, what's your final thought tonight?
9823459	9830384	My final thought is I don't know why I keep getting updates for Stitcher on... Freaking app.
9830904	9831625	Bye-bye app.
9831965	9832465	What happened?
9832885	9833326	I don't know.
9833426	9839470	It's somehow Stitcher added itself to my Facebook, and I keep getting updates for Stitcher stuff.
9839690	9842132	Oh, maybe because you voted in the award thing or something.
9842612	9842952	Who knows?
9843333	9844053	Oh, probably.
9844193	9844914	Thank you!
9846735	9850698	Although we like Stitcher, you could always unlike it after voting if you need to.
9850718	9852659	All right.
9853382	9853662	All right.
9854663	9864411	My final thought tonight is seeing Loki's McDonald's bag makes me think that I just impromptu had McDonald's for breakfast yesterday and a sausage biscuit.
9865152	9865753	Good times.
9866233	9867834	Totally not healthy, but good times.
9868215	9870977	I just got a free, was it free McFlurry?
9871357	9872598	Ooh, we playing Monopoly?
9872618	9873279	Oh, God.
9873379	9874440	It's so pathetic.
9874600	9882067	I've gotten McDonald's the last few days because I ran out of stuff to make lunches with, and it's literally almost the same game pieces every time.
9882267	9885250	I'm like, they're not even trying anymore.
9886131	9889694	I've gotten Boardwalk Park Plays like three times already.
9889734	9890375	I'm like, fuck this.
9890395	9892697	Because they want to get you really excited about maybe having a million.
9892737	9895619	I'm totally going to win one million dollars.
9895639	9896240	It's like,
9896460	9898942	which is payable in 20 yearly installments or something.
9899122	9899962	Hey, I don't care.
9900002	9901683	That's still a million dollars.
9902704	9903324	I don't care.
9904625	9905325	That's fine.
9905365	9905886	I'll take that.
9906906	9910348	Alright, thanks everybody for tuning in to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
