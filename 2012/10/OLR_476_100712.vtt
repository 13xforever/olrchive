00:07.000 --> 00:14.000

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
Tonight, October 7th, 2012, Sony sues a former spokesman. Cheating allegations emerge in the playoffs of one PC game competition.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And could pornography be on the way to the Xbox 360?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 476 for October 7th of 2012.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
If you happen to be listening to us live at the Voice of Geeks Network, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
If you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or some other type of smartphone application, well that's cool too.

01:00.000 --> 01:11.000
But please pencil us in sometime for a live show. We do tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:11.000 --> 01:20.000
We are here to talk about video games and all that good stuff with myself, Rob Roberts, and my co-host tonight here, Loki.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hi.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
How you doing Techmaster Loki?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm doing fine.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes. What's new with you? How was your day?

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
It was good. I did a lot of non-gaming stuff like mowing the backyard.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Damn that real life stuff. Damn it all.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
I've been putting it off for a while. Once the weather gets cooler then I'll do it and then finally the weather got cooler so I had to do it.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Alright, now before the chat room starts conspiracy theories, you'll notice I did not introduce Dark Sakura.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
We do love Dark Sakura but she is not here tonight. She ditched our ass to go hang with gays at Disneyland.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
Which, can you blame her? Let's be honest. It is the happiest place on earth after all.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
So she is wrapping up her trip at Disneyland. She should be back for the next live show.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
No sub co-host tonight. Alan's usually our standby co-host. He had to work.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
I put a call out on Twitter but I was a little late in doing that because I've been a little bit busy too with some other stuff going on.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
So it's just Loki and I here in the studio with you guys in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
The always present fourth guest on our show or I guess tonight third guest on our show.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
BlackWolf in our chat says I can blame her just like I blame Rob. F you buddy.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
What am I being blamed for?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I don't know.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I guess Bobby does not want to go to Disneyland.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
Perhaps you introduce Jamie to the love of Disneyland.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
No, no. It was the other way around.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
So she was the dealer?

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Yes. In this case Jamie was the dealer. Well it was really. You remember the OLR lesbians. Chris and Meg Z.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
Who used to live here in the Bay area. They've moved to Wisconsin. That's why they haven't been on the show that much anymore lately.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
But a few years ago they were the ones that took me to my first trip at Disneyland. They had already been taking Jamie.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
So they really. It's lesbians fault that I'm in love with Disneyland.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Big giant pyramid scheme.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Perhaps. Maybe there's money being kicked back or whatever. But you know.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
We spread the. We spread obsession love all around. See then I introduced Dark Soccer to Warcraft.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Shane introduced me to Mass Effect which I then got you know Dark Soccer into as well.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Thankfully I've been introduced to none of those things so.

03:27.000 --> 03:34.000
Well who started Minecraft? Was that. Was that me or was that you? Who finally. I think that was kind of you on Xbox.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
Well I think we were both on Xbox and then I decided to do the PC version and then.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
And then unfortunately it was just downhill from there.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
It's so fun. It's it's a good way to relax sometimes.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
All right. Let's see. Going to more comments in our chat room.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
Act Def talking about Dark Soccer's trip says it is the gayest place on earth literally.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Yes this weekend it is. But remember it's not officially recognized.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
No officially recognized gayest place on earth would be San Francisco.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
So you know unfortunately it's just today you know it's kind of like.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
I would argue the gayest place on earth is a Scissor Sisters concert in West Hollywood.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
But what do I know. Once again that's one of the temporary designations you know.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Whereas you know any other time it goes back to San Francisco.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
There actually is. If I remember right in New York New York listeners help me out here.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
But right off of Christopher Street which I recall is the gay district there.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
There is a street called Gay Street. If I remember right.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
New York listeners correct me if I'm wrong I know there's several of you listening.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
And in our chat room at chat chat dot orange lounge radio.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh excuse me chat dot live dot vog network dot com.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
You have one home for so many years it's hard to beat it out of your head.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
What can I say. Let's see.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Brad from pod cultures in our chat saying Rob Roberts.

04:57.000 --> 05:04.000
So Disney and games are social diseases now. Now let's not call it a disease.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Maybe just their distractions. That's what Rama confirming for me.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Yes there is a gay street over in the West Village. Thank you Rama.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
You know if she was rich enough she would totally be buying that replica haunted mansion that they have.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
I heard about that. What is that all about like a four street actual or excuse me four story actual replica.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah it's a replica except when they show the inside like that doesn't look like the haunted mansion at all.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
It doesn't resemble anything that I've seen. I don't remember there being a nice kitchen set and all this.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
I hope it's not the Nightmare Before Christmas version. Don't get me wrong.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
I love Haunted Mansion. I love Nightmare Before Christmas. I don't like it's like my IKEA versions.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
Unfortunately a whole nother nightmare there. All right.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
Before we get to our gaming weeks we always like to start off with a kickoff topic and I got to tell you I I'm kind of in the same boat as Loki.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.000
We've both been very busy lately just with other stuff going on. I don't know specifically what Loki's had going on but I know here locally.

05:59.000 --> 06:09.000
I am working very hard with some other people you might know actually Jessica Harper from under station lives Sunday night or Saturday nights here at Vogue Network is a big part of this too.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
We're trying to bring the Rocky Horror Picture Show back to Sacramento which to take a trip down memory lane.

06:15.000 --> 06:27.000
I've been involved with Rocky Horror for since like 98 and the first internet radio show I was on after my college radio shtick was under station live which was born of Rocky Horror.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
So you can kind of thank Rocky Horror for getting me into internet radio in the first place in a roundabout way.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
Well it's finally coming back to Sacramento and oh my gosh it has been a lot a lot of work and a lot of money and a lot of time but you know it's gonna be great.

06:40.000 --> 06:48.000
I really can't wait for the show. So it does kind of cut into the gaming time a little bit. I don't know if you've had the same experience with the stuff you've had going on.

06:48.000 --> 06:56.000
No I only did I only did the lawn mowing that was like two hours today and that was it. The rest of the week it hasn't been any any of that.

06:56.000 --> 07:07.000
But that's all the show is Friday if you happen to be in Northern California I urge you to check it out in Sacramento at the Colonial Theater 10 o'clock on Friday October 12th is the big show.

07:07.000 --> 07:15.000
And I'm hosting it and it will be a very crazy different side of me than what you see. Even worse than Hoard House so that's all I'm going to say about that.

07:15.000 --> 07:29.000
But yeah if you're local please come see the show. But after that I will finally have some time to get caught up on a few things that I've been neglecting like VOG and you know video games playing games and things like that.

07:29.000 --> 07:44.000
And it's just around the right season for Halloween and scary games and things of that sort going on which I thought we could talk a little bit about scary video games and games you know seasonal Halloween games.

07:44.000 --> 07:59.000
Now Loki do you ever play scary games that actually scare you like I know I know you I know you maybe don't want to admit this but do you ever play like scary video games actually make you scared legit scared.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Well I did play bullet which back then but you know that's that's a little different is that the showgirls answer.

08:05.000 --> 08:21.000
No that was just so terrible. No I don't really play scary games I guess. I don't know. Minecraft at one point was scary back when we were playing survival and you run into the first Enderman it's like oh shit there's Enderman then you realize how how pathetic they are then it's not very scary anymore.

08:21.000 --> 08:38.000
But no I honestly don't really play any scary games because I don't have a lot of time for that stuff. Let alone time to like turn off lights play scary game. I'm not really into Silent Hill so which which is fine because all the Silent Hills nowadays kind of.

08:38.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah I remember those speaking of Silent Hill. I remember when you and I were living together a while ago. This has been like in the early days of O.L.R. that was right when Silent Hill for the room was new and I was playing through that one night and I legit got scared like ice.

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
I like screamed I let out like this totally girls scream because something really scary happened like I walked into a room and there was like one of those two headed baby monsters was coming right at me.

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
And I'm like and you're like you're sitting over there playing Final Fantasy 11 or something you just kind of look over like what the hell's wrong with you.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
Like your response was classic. You were being highly insensitive and it was hilarious. Sounds like me.

09:20.000 --> 09:32.000
Locopoco in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says scariest game ever. Spice World. See everybody's going for the what's your favorite scary movie showgirls. They're going for that answer.

09:32.000 --> 09:47.000
Spice World is one of the most hilarious video games ever. I could tell another story about that but I won't about friends playing that game and just laughing and laughing and laughing a lot. Good times.

09:47.000 --> 09:59.000
You know their bus has the same technology as the TARDIS. It's a lot bigger on the inside than it actually. It's a British thing. It's it's it's the secrets that the British folks have figured out.

09:59.000 --> 10:09.000
Who cares about you know physics. That's fine. Make it entertaining. What up G in our chat says when does that new Silent Hill movie hit and should I see it.

10:09.000 --> 10:21.000
I think it's the end of the last last weekend of the month right before probably near Halloween. There's the new Silent Hill game which is on the Vita that's been delayed forever and it's finally coming on the 16th.

10:21.000 --> 10:34.000
That's probably your next Silent Hill bit but that's pretty much it. I mean it looks good. It's got what's his name from. Yeah I don't know what the hell his name is really from Game of Thrones.

10:35.000 --> 10:47.000
There's a lot of or I should say a lack of scary movies this year isn't there because you have a paranormal activity. We don't have you. We do have a parent or is there any for. I haven't seen any of those movies.

10:47.000 --> 11:01.000
Yeah there's a paranormal activity for there's insidious which apparently is really good. There's no saw anymore. No the saw is done. Yeah. Thank God. No they had those movies. They had I'm trying to think what else they had.

11:01.000 --> 11:15.000
There was one. I think it already came out though there was one that was the Chernobyl Diaries. That was one that was supposed to be all right. But yeah paranormal activity for.

11:15.000 --> 11:30.000
Trying to think when all their ones there are dark to see you with the save there. October 26 if I recall correctly Black Wolf with the gaming reference paranormal activity for apparently uses the connect to detect ghosts now.

11:30.000 --> 11:46.000
Oh yeah I think I read something about that. It's just got to keep it current. Whatever it's just in a scene. Let's see Shayna link goes in our chat room saying the little goomba like enemies and braid freak me out for no reason.

11:46.000 --> 12:01.000
I guess sometimes there's there's like certain like mobs that are just really creepy looking in video games that might kind of freak you out. I don't know. Maybe just hits that nerve. All right. Anyhow live dog vog network dot com if you want to comment along with the show.

12:01.000 --> 12:13.000
I wish our soccer was here so I could ask her about scary games because I know she's played her share of them but oh well we'll get her answer next week as we ramp up to Halloween. Let's talk about video games we have been playing what little there may be.

12:13.000 --> 12:27.000
I at least have one new game to talk about. I don't know what you got Loki. How was your gaming week. Well this week I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 as I normally do. I was going for what I call streak week which means I won every single game of the week.

12:27.000 --> 12:48.000
I missed it by one. So I missed it by one and by three points and it was just because we were down the plane with only three people and it was a small map and it was just one of those games where I'd end up spawning on the opposite side of the map is the other two guys and you know they get kill and then it spawned the other side by the time I got over there and it was just back and forth like that.

12:48.000 --> 13:02.000
So unfortunately it's just I wasn't able to rack up enough kills. I didn't know when the game prior to that you know by quite a bit I usually was doubling or tripling their scores but you know I got 16 out of you know that was a nine and 16.

13:02.000 --> 13:30.000
It was like 18 out of the 19 games we played. That's not bad. So whatever. And then I played Minecraft a little bit. Most of this week was spent just kind of wandering around because I didn't really know what I wanted to build because I got I mean I was sort of not really done my castle but I don't want to go through and furnish everything because it's a pain in the ass in creative mode to put stuff in chess.

13:30.000 --> 13:43.000
You have to kind of put it into your hot bar and move it into your survival inventory and then go up to the chest and move it into from the chest. You know you saw that inventory into the chest and then you have to fill it all back up again.

13:43.000 --> 13:51.000
You can't just like open the chest open the you know creative inventory or whatever and just drop everything in there that you want which would be ideal.

13:51.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah. Stupid asked me actually destroyed my chest and everything in it. But thankfully to creative mode I could put it all back and then some. Yeah. So there's that. And then I kind of.

14:06.000 --> 14:18.000
Well I had prior to Rob getting on the server I was hustling to get the giant snowman done because you know the snowman went with the snow golems that were in his house and the mushrooms which my friend put in there.

14:18.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah. Thanks for that by the way. Those are fun. And we want it. Well originally I was going to that was a scary moment video games by the way when I logged into that and then all of a sudden and it's like moo cows.

14:32.000 --> 14:42.000
Cows can be kind of scary. Just so you know you know they're changing all the sound effects for those cows soon. Really. Yeah. The next update they're going to have witches and bats.

14:42.000 --> 14:53.000
And it's a Halloween update. So witches bats and some other fun stuff and they're going to have witches huts and they're going to redo all the sound effects for things. So that's kind of anyway.

14:53.000 --> 15:05.000
So Minecraft actually did start working on a little bit. What was it they hit sun's been making this kind of wild network of portals to another and stuff. So you can walk around the map.

15:05.000 --> 15:19.000
So I've been I was dressing up one of those portals because it's near my castle so I was going to incorporate that into the castle a little bit. I just like maybe I should just expand my castle a little bit more since I was kind of having fun doing that.

15:19.000 --> 15:33.000
But yeah I'm going to try to stay away from making giant spheres in the game because that's a pain in the ass. And I did you know that snowman was huge. By the way I was originally going to have it where you'd step on something and shoot snowballs at you but it got too tall.

15:33.000 --> 15:47.000
So I put arrows in it now but it still shoots all it does is shoot the like billboard which is kind of ridiculous. But so you built something to actually shoot the ad for Orange Lounge Radio that somebody built in.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
Well it wasn't there when I was originally okay but they built it in there. So whatever it was funny.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
And then what else did I play.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
I know there's something else. Is it something my phone.

16:06.000 --> 16:17.000
I downloaded the little big planet demo so I haven't gotten a chance to check that out yet but I was going to because I charged my via again. So I've been using it but I do want to pick up.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
I may pick up a little big planet on that.

16:21.000 --> 16:33.000
What else. What else. So it's again dishonored soon. So I'll have that. I don't know if I'm going to play it though. It's one of those things I may just sell it. I got Resident Evil 6 that's going.

16:33.000 --> 16:43.000
Yeah. I have not heard good things about Resident Evil 6. There's some people that are talking about it in chat. There's a few people I I've just been kind of keep my eye on chat. Some people are saying it's really not that bad.

16:43.000 --> 16:53.000
I heard something about a final boss that's kind of it looks very over the top. See this is something like I don't know who any of these characters are because I don't follow the series at all.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
It's just something I haven't gotten into and I don't really want to get into now.

16:57.000 --> 17:09.000
Dishonored looks all right. So I'm kind of interested in that. Modern Warfare you know or not Modern Warfare Black Ops 2 looks interesting so I'll hopefully check that out once that gets around here which a whole lot of drama with that.

17:09.000 --> 17:21.000
Here comes some of the comments. Acidic vampire in chat says Resident Evil 6 is not that bad. Which says to me it's kind of bad but it's not that bad. If you're a longtime fan maybe you'll put up with it.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Let's see someone else.

17:24.000 --> 17:35.000
Code Man's asking a question about your Minecraft habits in another game that you've talked about before. Code Man says Loki have you gotten the Minecraft sniper rifle in Borderlands 2? It shoots Minecraft arrows.

17:36.000 --> 17:50.000
I haven't but see that's the problem. Minecraft has kept me away from well Minecraft and my wife watching this the entire series of medium has gotten me kind of away from Borderlands because unfortunately I don't really have anything.

17:50.000 --> 17:59.000
You know actually I could go in the other room and play it on the other TV. Well anyways I haven't really bothered to try to play it yet but it's been a while since I've been playing Borderlands.

18:00.000 --> 18:12.000
That's one of the ones I was trying to go back and play this week but I just didn't get a chance to. I've been playing Minecraft because I haven't had access to the TV. I'm waiting for it to get done with the season. She's on season 5 right now out of 7.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
When did she start because that sounds like pretty fast progress to me.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
A month or two ago.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
That's not bad.

18:21.000 --> 18:40.000
Yeah so she's been watching Netflix and God that show is terrible. It's not terrible it's just you can totally tell when they like switched up the writers because the first two seasons were all right and then the third season it got weird and then the fourth season it got really weird and then.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Sounds like you've been watching a lot of it too.

18:42.000 --> 18:55.000
I have been just because it's on TV and I've actually watched some of it before but the fifth season it's kind of back to how it was before it's like maybe that was when the writers strike was or something like that it just really strange.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
But anyways I'm no medium talker.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
So you late critical myth in chat says medium is a terrible show. I sympathize Loki.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Thankfully I've already spoiled it for my wife so.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Well she was spoiled books for me anyways you know.

19:12.000 --> 19:22.000
So yeah so that's it. I probably go back and play some more Minecraft. I've been having fun without my coworkers having fun. I did I want been trying to figure out plugins that I want to put in there.

19:23.000 --> 19:50.000
Although the server they run it can run it's basically got its multi craft is the front end and it's got a bunch of different server types you can do you can do a default you do like a vanilla server and optimize Minecraft server then bucket bucket server in a bucket beta server and buckets basically a server that has plugins in it and so you can add different bucket plugins to the game to do different things.

19:50.000 --> 20:07.000
So one of the things I did which doesn't require bucket is I enabled raise many maps which is actually pretty awesome because one of the things that like I did explore the map and I get lost and I wouldn't be able to figure out where the hell my you know how to get back other than doing a teleport which I've been doing.

20:08.000 --> 20:15.000
But now I had waypoints and so I know OK my house is in that direction so I know where I'm going and stuff.

20:16.000 --> 20:30.000
So they did that oh one thing I did do in Minecraft I went back to the village because there's a village with actual villagers around there and their village was terrible because it spawned and there's like doorways that they can't get to so I made them a really terrible looking pink.

20:30.000 --> 20:44.000
Pink wool house that they can go into and I spawned a bunch of villagers in there and a bunch of these iron golems to defend them against the zombies because all they were doing is like getting eaten by zombies so I had to repopulate.

20:45.000 --> 20:57.000
So that's it but yeah looking for plugins I want to do the planes I want to do the planes but that requires like Minecraft Forge and I'm not really sure how to install that on a server that's not really my sound of access to the files that.

20:58.000 --> 21:10.000
You know I think I have to ask them to upgrade you know us when the new Minecraft version comes out or something like that I think you have to do I don't think they do it automatically so I have to figure that out and I want to do the planes would be awesome and.

21:11.000 --> 21:21.000
Maybe the guns I do want to do like a mob arena where we can just set up there's I think a bucket plug and reset up an area and you can just have it where you fight mobs and then when you die.

21:21.000 --> 21:32.000
You know depending on how many mobs you kill you get a reward and you don't really die in the game you don't lose anything but you just die in the arena so it'd be kind of cool might set that up.

21:33.000 --> 21:43.000
That's it all right well I don't want to turn this into the Minecraft show but I played a little bit of Minecraft as well I logged into the server and promptly got scared like hell as to all that crap that they put in my house.

21:44.000 --> 21:58.000
And then I went outside and I saw on this vog server they just built everything around my house and I use this analogy on Bobby show as well but it's like you're the one holdout in the neighborhood who won't sell their house I'm like that old guy and up where everything is built around the house.

21:58.000 --> 22:08.000
And they're trying to buy your house so I was like you know what I'm just going to I'm going to bulldoze my house and go somewhere remote it's not like I won't ever be able to get back we could build an elaborate rail car unit or whatever.

22:08.000 --> 22:24.000
So I went to an unexplored part on my map that was just due south I just headed south of all that stuff code ban and chat says I got lost looking for skies new house I went south so there's a brick house that's up on a hill that's half finished unless.

22:24.000 --> 22:38.000
Bobby I think I haven't been I was threatening to finish it for me I didn't finish I technically didn't finish this field all I did was just flat it out okay what's a joke I couldn't I couldn't think of anything I want to do my house is flat enough this mountain I'm sure he won't mind.

22:39.000 --> 22:47.000
But I started to build my little brick house and I like the idea of being like a little bit farther away from all the action outside the city it's my summer home so.

22:48.000 --> 23:00.000
Out there so I was working on that a little bit but I didn't have a whole lot of time for Minecraft I did play a little more World of Warcraft because obviously the expansion is still pretty great I'll leave all my thoughts on that to a horde house.com.

23:00.000 --> 23:12.000
I will talk about a new game however the new game I want to talk about this week is did the stream go down people in chatter saying it went no I show that we're still submitting data so I don't know what the hell's going on.

23:13.000 --> 23:26.000
The joys of doing live radio and we have nothing like Alan's not even here tonight so he's not playing Mass Effect or anything Jamie's not her computers not even here she's not here so we've got very little data I'm just yeah yeah all right well anyway.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
Hopefully you all get back in time to hear me talk about the one game new game I did play this week because this is kind of important.

23:34.000 --> 23:44.000
The new game that I played this week is Tokyo jungle on the PlayStation three yeah remember this remember this let me set the stage a little bit do you remember about.

23:45.000 --> 23:50.000
Oh God I was probably about four or five years ago at this point we were talking about a game called President Cat.

23:50.000 --> 24:03.000
And it was a game from Japan that I think the actual name of it was like Suki bonds to chow right now we are some of that I think about since our rain I probably butcher that name a little bit apologies to Japanese listeners.

24:03.000 --> 24:16.000
But that was the game and we were looking at pictures of the game we were like oh my gosh this looks amazing it's like you play as this cat doing these crazy things like driving a car and doing all this stuff really where are these games in America.

24:16.000 --> 24:28.000
Where are these new ideas where are these things we haven't seen before that are for the lols and hilarious and we started I think we got our listeners to tweet the people that made the game.

24:29.000 --> 24:37.000
And it caught some of the game bloggers attention like we ended up being on joysticks of the other sites because of it like you know orange on radio took it upon themselves to make President Cat happen.

24:37.000 --> 24:49.000
And then there was that whole follow up article about how Suki bonds so chow ran a we supposedly only sold 100 copies the week it came out which I still claim is is bullshit and somebody going for a sensationalist headline to one of those was mine.

24:50.000 --> 25:01.000
Well yeah I know I'm like Loki bought it. But anyway so if there is ever a time to get President Cat it is now present presidential race is on.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
That's right. Vote number three President.

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
It was 2008 because we I remember there was a ad that was poking fun at the Obama hope campaign. So it was 2008 when all that went down.

25:14.000 --> 25:25.000
But anyway the point is why I bring that up to Tokyo jungle is that here is a game that's kind of that same crazy Japanese idea but it's actually coming out here.

25:25.000 --> 25:35.000
And the whole trick of it is that you know humans are gone. It's this you know world where the animals are basically you know fighting to survive because humans are gone.

25:36.000 --> 25:48.000
And now the cities are still there it's like the zombie apocalypse happened or something the animals are still alive. You get to unfold part about like what happened as you play more and more of the game.

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
But you basically select what animal you want to play the game as and you start with two you start with one carnivore and one herbivore.

25:57.000 --> 26:07.000
And you can play as a little Pomeranian dog is the part of where you start as or you can play as some type of deer like a silica deer I think it's called or something is the herbivore that you can start with.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
Oh thank you off can anagram says it was October 22nd 2009 I guess it wasn't that long ago.

26:14.000 --> 26:20.000
And Tiger class is the premise of Tokyo jungle is similar to that show on the Discovery Channel called life after people.

26:21.000 --> 26:32.000
Well anyway you can play as one of these animals and the game kind of plays a little bit more like an arcade game it's fast much faster pace than you think you quickly are trying to get all these goals.

26:32.000 --> 26:43.000
And it would be basically to kill other animals and eat them because you have to eat to survive because your hunger meter starts to go down unless of course you're an herbivore then you're eating plants and avoiding getting eaten by other animals.

26:44.000 --> 26:54.000
But no matter what animal you're playing as there's always someone bigger that's trying to eat you and you have to stay out of toxic dumps that could be in the city you have to stay away from all these things.

26:54.000 --> 27:05.000
So you have all these meters that are constantly draining you have to stay on top of and make sure are full and then you're trying to complete all these micro goals so maybe it's eating and then it's marking your territory.

27:06.000 --> 27:13.000
Yes you get to mark your territory in the game and then it's finding a female to mate with and then actually mating with the female.

27:14.000 --> 27:31.000
Oh my god Loki I died laughing the first time that scene happened because you play us this little Pomeranian and we found the little female Pomeranian and went to the little nest and it goes all the way up to the dog getting up on his hind legs mounting the female Pomeranian before it fades to black.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
So there's no thrust but there's definitely the assume the position and I was dying so that was great.

27:40.000 --> 27:51.000
And that made me laugh a lot and then you basically you'll start the next generation so in the next generation you get stats passed down to you based on how you did in the first generation.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
So the key to maxing out your stats is to continue to mate and get all these stats from having played the game.

28:00.000 --> 28:13.000
But here's the thing this game is very Japanese in that it's very grindy and I don't mean the animal sex I was just talking about I mean like you know you have a lot of stuff you have to do and it's very unforgiving.

28:14.000 --> 28:24.000
Because remember you've got three different meters if one of them drops you're dead you can only live about 15 years I think 20 years at the most if you don't mate within 20 years you're dead.

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
And by the way you have one life when you're dead game over it's all over.

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
So that's like Dark Souls level of unforgiving which is kind of awesome I have to say it kind of you know ramps the pressure up a little bit.

28:40.000 --> 28:50.000
But there I will say this there is a way you can get more than one life and it is if you breed and you happen to have like four children you'll run around us a little pack.

28:50.000 --> 28:59.000
And if one of you dies then another can take over but because you're running around in a pack one of your pack might have to be a decoy and take the hit so you don't take the hit.

29:00.000 --> 29:06.000
So there's all this crap going on that you kind of have to manage I have to say it's pretty damn fun.

29:07.000 --> 29:17.000
And you don't really see games like this that are out in America now is it a perfect game no sometimes you can get a little frustrating sometimes it feels a little grindy.

29:18.000 --> 29:26.000
I was really irritated with the way that you can only save after you breed because it might take you a good 15 minutes to get from one life cycle to another.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
And sometimes like I have to quit and save right now and if I don't if I don't save properly my game's gone basically you know you can't do anything about that.

29:35.000 --> 29:50.000
So it's unforgivingness is almost a little bit too much but I really support this game and I'm a fan of it because it's totally like Sony is trying something that I think and we've said for a long time here on Orange Lawns Radio should be tried.

29:51.000 --> 30:07.000
They took a game that was out as a retail game a $60 game in Japan which I got to say I don't think the game's worth 60 bucks but they made it they translated it they put it out for $15, 12 if you're PlayStation Plus on the PlayStation Network and it's a full fledged game.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
For $12 it's pretty hard to not appreciate that value.

30:12.000 --> 30:24.000
There's about like I think something like 30 different animals you can play as and then of course there's DLC if you want to play as more animals but there's crazy shit like panda bears and you know there's all this like funny stuff.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
They even had in Japan they actually had it where one of the creatures you get was a salaryman.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah I think I think that that happens later on so.

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat says at live.vognetwork.com a game where I can pee and have sex with everything? Sold!

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Let's see.

30:42.000 --> 30:48.000
ActDef says it's Mass Effect with animals. Not quite because there's really no dialogue and that's kind of the big part about Mass Effect.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
Tigerclaw says when you play as the lions you have to protect the pride from rogue lions that are trying to take over.

30:56.000 --> 31:03.000
Yeah that's I mean even when you play as the Pomeranian a beagle might take your ass out in 30 seconds. That's how I got killed the first time.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
I'm running around doing my thing and then all of a sudden like a beagle jumps out of nowhere and attacks me and kills me. Game over.

31:09.000 --> 31:18.000
So if you're the type that throws the controller at the TV and things like that when you get frustrated you may not really be into this game as much.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
But I love that it's something different.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
This game won't be for everybody but it's something different. I like it as an arcade style game.

31:27.000 --> 31:33.000
So there you go. Tokyo Jungle. Loki you think you might pick this up at some point after hearing me talk about it? Maybe.

31:34.000 --> 31:42.000
It's neat. It'll probably be on sale even more in a few months. The weird thing is nobody's really talking about this game. I tried to look up reviews online.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
I found like three reviews. One great. One average. One negative. So this game is very polarizing I gotta say.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
But like none of the big sites reviewed it at all and I've hardly read anything about it anywhere.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
So it really sucks that like Sony's like trying this experiment and it might fail due to lack of promotion.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
So I'm just saying everybody I'll use what little podcast we have here. If you think you might be interested in this type of game go check out Tokyo Jungle.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
Cause it's a neat little gem on the Playstation Network.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
Alright before we get into gaming news for tonight we have some housekeeping. I have quite a bit of housekeeping tonight actually.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
Does the show sound any different to you tonight? It may or may not. It might be a subtle difference.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
But we actually have new microphones here in studio.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
And I'm hoping even though the difference probably won't be that drastic because we still have the same mixing board.

32:34.000 --> 32:41.000
You might hear hopefully what if it's done right hopefully you'll hear less popping and hopefully Loki's volume changes won't be as bad.

32:42.000 --> 32:49.000
But the nice thing is we're all on like the same mic now. Dan will have his own mic when he comes to guests on the show next time. Hooray.

32:50.000 --> 32:55.000
And so I really want to thank Brad from Pod Culture for helping us out with the new microphones.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
They are kind of hand-me-down microphones but if you've ever listened to Pod Culture their audio is really good.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
So I was really happy to take on these microphones. So I really want to thank them.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
They are on Monday nights of the Voice of Geeks Network at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
And they have done a lot. Brad from Pod Culture has done a lot and is very supportive of the projects I've done.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
He hosts the website for Hoard House. He did those decals or I don't think he did them himself.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
But he arranged the deal for those decals for Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
So I'm really thankful for all Brad does for the show. So I really want to thank him.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I also want to make sure I thank Misty at some point because she played into this too.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
When she was here visiting for the 10th anniversary she kicked in some financial support for that.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
So I just really want to acknowledge and appreciate Misty as well as all you guys that tune in to hear it every week.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
We try to get a little better. Even though we've been on for 10 and a half years now we still try to get better.

33:48.000 --> 33:55.000
So hopefully this little new mic thing will go an extra step in making this show even better.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
Speaking of Pod Culture and all of the Monday Night shows on the Voice of Geeks Network.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
It is Doctor Who Monday on the Voice of Geeks Network tomorrow.

34:05.000 --> 34:15.000
Three shows all talking about Doctor Who. Critical Myth, British Invaders and Pod Culture's special TARDIS Interruptus are all taking on Doctor Who tomorrow.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
As I understand, now I have to be honest, I haven't seen a lot of the new Doctor Who.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
I saw some of the Christopher Eccleston episodes but I haven't seen much after that. Although it was really good.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
I have never seen Doctor Who.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
I need to sit down and watch it. It is actually really good. At least the older stuff I've seen.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
But from what I understand there was some controversy around the most recent episode that happened.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
So I know Critical Myth and Pod Culture and TARDIS Interruptus both want to take that on a little bit.

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
British Invaders which is sandwiched right between the two shows. Back to back shows on the Voice of Geeks Network tomorrow taking on classic Doctor Who.

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Before the Russell T Davies era going back to the 60's and 70's.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
So it's a really nice mix of the new and the old tomorrow on VOG.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
And that's what I love. I love that that's what this network is all about.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Is that everybody has a common theme going on. So very cool.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
That's tomorrow night. Starts at 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern with Critical Myth.

35:09.000 --> 35:14.000
5 Pacific, 8 Eastern with British Invaders. 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern with Pod Culture.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
And even if you miss Doctor Who night because you're listening on the podcast feed or what have you.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Do check out these excellent shows another time on the network another Monday.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
And they do rerun throughout the week as well.

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
Also want to plug Umlaud. It is Umlaud season. Can you believe it?

35:31.000 --> 35:37.000
Umlaud is the rock band event for charity. It takes place at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco every December.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And the fundraising season is in effect for this year.

35:40.000 --> 35:49.000
They still need a couple more bands. Very surprising they didn't sell out as fast as they did last year because Tim Schafer is hosting the event this year.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
That's a huge score for Umlaud. That's amazing.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
So if you want to have Tim Schafer introduce you on stage, you got to snag one of those band packages right now.

35:59.000 --> 36:05.000
There's only a couple left. And I'm thinking just because like gas is like $4.70 a gallon in California right now.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
People are having trouble saving up that extra money to do the band package.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
Trust me it is a great cause and a great charity event.

36:14.000 --> 36:20.000
So I'm hoping to be involved in one way or another. I will be there for sure one way or another at the event this year.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So more information about that coming in future weeks.

36:24.000 --> 36:29.000
I've been trying to talk to Seg, one of the organizers. We're really trying to get him on the show at some point.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
December 6, 2012 is the official date at the DNA Lounge in San Francisco.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
Thursday and I bet it's going to be streamed on the internet again.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
Just a bet because it was last year. So I bet they're going to do it again.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
One other thing. It's a plug. I got a lot tonight. What can I say?

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
It is also awards season in the podcast universe. Podcast awards and Stitcher awards. Two of them this year.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
You can nominate for the podcast award one time at podcastawards.com.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
And we really encourage you to nominate Orange Lounge Radio as your best gaming show.

37:06.000 --> 37:13.000
We would also really encourage you to consider other VOG programming and other independent programming in the other categories.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
For example, TV movie. Critical Myth is a great TV movie show.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Sci-fi. Pod culture. Mature. Understation Live.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
And lots of great, great shows on the network to consider for some of these categories.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
So I really encourage you to do that at podcastawards.com.

37:31.000 --> 37:36.000
The Stitcher awards are also having their awards season and you can check that out.

37:37.000 --> 37:42.000
The links are available on our Facebook and I will also place those links in chat a little later.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
And you can nominate once a day for the Stitcher awards.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
So if you want to nominate multiple show like you want to do. Oh you're like, oh my god there's so many gaming shows I love on the VOG network.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
I want to nominate them all. You can do Orange Lounge Radio one day. Then Bobby Black Wolf the next day.

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
Then Girls Gone Wow the next day. You know you can kind of cycle through and that'll work.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
So that is available at stitcher.com.

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
And as I was talking about at the end of Bobby Black Wolf's show, I really think because the iOS 6 podcasting app has not been super well received.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
Stitcher and all this stuff is really the wave of the future along with TuneIn and other types of iOS.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Excuse me, not just iOS but Android and mobile phone apps is really the wave of the future.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
So I really encourage you guys to help us kind of be on that cutting edge with a nomination.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
Remember we don't ask for your money for this show. All we ask is to help us with the word of mouth.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Okay now we can get into gaming news. Sorry a lot of announcements tonight. What can I say?

38:33.000 --> 38:42.000
Alright. Let's talk a little bit about Cliffy B. He is gone. He decided to leave Epic Games.

38:43.000 --> 38:49.000
And you know basically it makes sense. He's been doing it since he's been a teenager.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
And he said outside of my sabbatical last year I've been going nonstop.

38:54.000 --> 39:00.000
And you know grew up in this business as Mike Capps likes to say.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
And now that I'm growing up it's time for a much needed break.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
So cool. I'm not sure who else is going to be kind of taken over for some of that stuff now that he's gone.

39:11.000 --> 39:21.000
But it's cool to see him kind of get his break because he's definitely been busy with Gears of War.

39:22.000 --> 39:30.000
I've heard a lot of rumors and this is total fanboy wank but I want to indulge it a little bit at just how wanky this all is.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
You know which rumor this is right? Like where he went or where he's going? Who offered to buy him? Have you heard this?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
No.

39:38.000 --> 39:45.000
What would be the craziest fanboy company that people hope hired Cliffy B to show how serious they are?

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
Zynga?

39:51.000 --> 40:01.000
No, no. Nintendo. There are rumors online that Cliffy B went to Nintendo. Which I, you know, obvious fanboy wank. I don't want to indulge it too much.

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
But you can't help yourself. Like once the seed is planted in your head you're like, God Nintendo really should hire someone like him.

40:10.000 --> 40:18.000
It doesn't matter. I don't think it matters because, I don't know. It's just, I don't know what he would be able to do for them.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
Hopefully make another franchise because seriously they need some new franchises.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
They need some new franchises.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
Invent a hardcore franchise? Maybe with some of the characterization, Japanese characterization? I don't know. Maybe I'm crazy but.

40:32.000 --> 40:39.000
They've had like hardcore franchises at one point I thought. I don't know.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Sin and Punishment?

40:42.000 --> 40:50.000
Yeah, Sin and Punishment is pretty awesome. I mean there's that. There's, you know, Eternal Darkness. I mean that was kind of.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
But none of that on the Wii U. None of it.

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
ActDeft says Cliffy B did get a letter printed in Nintendo Power.

40:59.000 --> 41:05.000
So, you know, apparently a lot of people leeching onto that like, oh he's always loved Nintendo. He'd go work for them.

41:06.000 --> 41:17.000
Um, cool. I mean, I don't know if the reason he's quitting Epic Games was because he feels like he needs a break.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I don't know if he's going to jump right into something else right now.

41:21.000 --> 41:25.000
Unless he's just making excuses. Which is kind of a pussy way of doing it. I mean if you ask me.

41:26.000 --> 41:32.000
Well, but there's also kind of the right corporate way of doing things and maybe he's going to take a siesta for a few months until the next E3.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
I'm leaving because Nintendo is about to hire me. Sweet!

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
Technus in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Cliffy B did Nintendo is a real stretch. I wouldn't be surprised if he went to Microsoft though.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
That's a little more like, okay, realistic category. Or Sony. I could see that happening too.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
Who knows? Anything's possible. Anything's possible. It's a crazy world. It's a crazy world.

41:56.000 --> 42:08.000
Uh, Saig asks a challenging question though. How would he benefit from going to Nintendo? Maybe they offered him houses full of money. I mean, Cliffy B is kind of a rockstar.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
We've given you a Nintendo DS. It prints money.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
So, again, I don't want to buy into the fanboy wank too much. I'm not saying I personally believe it.

42:19.000 --> 42:27.000
I can definitely see the angle of, shit, you've been doing one thing for 20 years and maybe you just want to change.

42:28.000 --> 42:32.000
He's going to go design playgrounds. Just playgrounds with chainsaws attached to them. That kind of thing.

42:33.000 --> 42:41.000
But the interesting thing is, the guys at BioWare, the doctors at BioWare did a very similar thing recently. They left the industry after a very long time.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
I kind of don't think they're going to show up anywhere else.

42:43.000 --> 42:50.000
Oh my god. You know what's going on. They're going to make a game company that's like, was it Polytron?

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
Oh, you think all these game journalists that left are going to make...

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
They're going to create the League of Super Game Designers and make this company that'll create, like, something.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Yeah, there's that Polygon, which did they ever officially launch?

43:04.000 --> 43:10.000
Oh, who gives a fuck. I seriously don't care. It is like the most hipster bullshit company.

43:11.000 --> 43:20.000
It's like, hey, we're so cool. We're going to print articles about, we're going to do a documentary about the creation of our company, our website that's not fucking finished yet.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
No one cares about your fucking website.

43:24.000 --> 43:38.000
That, I mean, how fucking, you know, snub-nosed, you know, pompous bullshit is that? I mean, you're just going to create a documentary because you all want to know how this happened. No one fucking cares.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
Are you saying, you know, the views and opinions of Loki do not express those at Orange Lounge Radio necessarily.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
So what's your name? Is you really interested in that?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
But, but, yeah.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
God, I can't talk to you.

43:50.000 --> 43:57.000
I'm going to say I'm not going to touch that with a 10-foot pole. Are you saying that this site has lost itself up its own asshole before it's even launched?

43:58.000 --> 43:58.000


43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Just checking.

44:01.000 --> 44:01.000


44:02.000 --> 44:09.000
SSJ 100 Matt is asking, do they print out game ads in Whole Foods and Trader Joe's? Look, I don't want this to be a shade-throwing competition. Look, we're going to walk away from this.

44:10.000 --> 44:20.000
But let's talk about the whole idea of the Super Justice League of Game Developers. So you think maybe CliffyBee, BioWare, you know Zynga lost some people this week too.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
Do you think it could be like the Super League of Mobile Phone Developers?

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Maybe. What if he went to Apple?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
Oh, God.

44:31.000 --> 44:41.000
He would be, he would be a pretty cool, like, presenter. I mean, because, you know, they need something kind of, you know, with a lot of...

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Are you saying Tim Cook doesn't have enough energy?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
No, he doesn't.

44:47.000 --> 44:54.000
All right. Anyhow, all right. So CliffyBee's leaving. And so we dedicate this to you, CliffyBee.

45:01.000 --> 45:23.000
Let's move on to something. We've gone from a very American company to something very Japanese, but a lot of you love it. It's Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix. You're rolling your eyes over there.

45:23.000 --> 45:32.000
I'm rolling my eyes at the name. I mean, seriously, just come up with a better fucking name. 1.5 HD. How's it one and a half? So...

45:33.000 --> 45:39.000
I'm going to tell you. I'm so glad you asked, Loki. Here is how Kingdom Hearts 1 is now Kingdom Hearts one and a half. You ready?

45:40.000 --> 45:40.000


45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
The screen for each game will rearrange to accommodate for widescreen support, including the HUD rearrangement.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
No reaction.

45:49.000 --> 45:58.000
No reaction. The models for Sora and all his friends have been replaced with ones from Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance, the newest game in the series.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
Nothing. All right. Trophy support for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
No? Nothing? I thought you were an achievement whore.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
No, I'm not.

46:11.000 --> 46:20.000
Game mechanics have been updated to make the gameplay feel more like Kingdom Hearts 2. Now, in all reality, that could be a good thing if they fixed the camera from the first game.

46:21.000 --> 46:28.000
I'm hoping that's the hidden message in there without them wanting to admit that the first game had abort camera. You have to admit, that's a little better, right?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
It's a nice addition, I guess.

46:30.000 --> 46:41.000
All right, there you go. We got something. 70% of the story from 358 slash 2 days will be represented with over 100 new scenes created with full voice acting.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Oh! Oh my gosh! Was that an admission from Loki that there might be something worthwhile here?

46:47.000 --> 46:53.000
Well, it's all cutscenes from another game because they didn't want to actually port over 358 slash 2 or whatever.

46:53.000 --> 47:08.000
Well, I'm so glad you said something about that because Tetsuya Nomura said he originally wanted to do a full remake of the 358 slash 2 days, but he didn't have enough time in production to start a project, thus the decision to utilize theater mode to tell the story.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
That's kind of lame.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.000
Ran out of time?

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
That's lame. That's an excuse. It's just easier to update everything.

47:15.000 --> 47:27.000
Well, now, he was asked in this interview with Famitsu, would Kingdom Hearts 2 get the same treatment? And the response was a laugh and, quote, it'd be unusual if there wasn't.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Because we've already decided that we're doing that.

47:31.000 --> 47:39.000
Well, I bet a lot of it is, how well does this first one sell? If this one sells like crazy, then sure, that's a logical conclusion to get to.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Well, then they'll do the PSP games on top of it, you know, for the next one.

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
The Vita?

47:45.000 --> 47:58.000
Well, no. No, they'll do the PSP games up rez, because just like they did with, you know, remember, Sony's already on the record saying that they've got a wonderful engine that can, you know, port PSP stuff into HD for, you know, the PS3, so why not?

47:59.000 --> 48:08.000
Another quote along the same lines of this whole, does this mean there's a 2.5? Quote, and from Tetsuya Nomura, quote, I figured there were people who had a hard time keeping up with the sequels.

48:08.000 --> 48:19.000
We had to start from the beginning with Kingdom Hearts HD. I also thought that familiar fans might make new discoveries seeing everything in chronological order with the sequels side by side. I'm happy to be restarting this title.

48:20.000 --> 48:26.000
I don't think it's a problem that people necessarily have problems keeping up with the sequels. It's that people can't keep up with the fucking story.

48:26.000 --> 48:42.000
Like, isn't Kingdom Hearts, like, supposed to be aimed at kids? And it's like this, it's, the story is crazy convoluted. Like, I can't even understand it. It's worse than, like, as the world turns. Like, it's crazy.

48:45.000 --> 48:49.000
Frisbee in chat asks, how can you remake something that isn't that old?

48:50.000 --> 49:04.000
Well, it's, it's, it's getting there, though. By the time this is actually out, you know, 2013 would be about the time frame this is out, right? The first Kingdom Hearts game was, what, 2000, 2003 maybe? About ten years? Nine years, maybe?

49:05.000 --> 49:12.000
They remake God of War. Or they'll up-res it. It's not really a remake, it's just up-resing everything.

49:13.000 --> 49:20.000
Technus in chat says, Square Enix is kind of like the honey badger of Japanese developers. They just don't give a fuck and just do whatever they feel like doing today.

49:21.000 --> 49:27.000
Alan Alchemy says, you can't argue you have no fucking idea what's going on anymore. Here comes a sequel. He's putting that in quotes.

49:28.000 --> 49:37.000
I think it's a good idea to have, like, these re-releases because, you know, it's most likely ramping up to a Kingdom Hearts 3 or something like that so they're going to put these re-releases out there so that people kind of have an idea what the fuck's going on.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Let the hype train begin.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
And get back into it and then, you know, go from there.

49:43.000 --> 49:53.000
Well, we will see what happens. I love this other comment from Alan Alchemy. P.S. we made figuring out what the fuck was going on very, very hard. We know haters make us famous.

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
Absolutely. Haters make us famous. Let's move on.

49:58.000 --> 50:14.000
Alright, so there's a new service that's going to be coming out from Microsoft. Xbox Music. It's supposed to be coming this month and actually launching, I guess, alongside Windows 8, which I'm surprised that so soon is October 26th.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Who cares about Windows 8? Go see Silent Hill.

50:18.000 --> 50:33.000
And then, of course, it sounds very similar to, like, Pandora. Basically, you know, it's going to be ad-supported and you'll be able to also use, I guess, Windows 8, Xbox 360, Windows Phone.

50:34.000 --> 50:43.000
It's going to tie into Microsoft SkyDrive and, I guess, allow you to sync your playlists and music libraries across all the devices and stuff.

50:43.000 --> 50:54.000
And, I don't know. Neat. I mean, I'm glad it's free because, you know, I don't want to have to pay for stuff. Ad support is fine.

50:55.000 --> 51:05.000
Free is good, but I think, you know, because you're talking about Pandora and there's all these other services Xbox already offers that Xbox Music has to be better than that are also free.

51:05.000 --> 51:14.000
Last.fm is available on the 360. iHeartRadio, which is kind of Clear Channel's little Pandora-esque theme, but you can actually listen to over-the-air radio stations with it, too.

51:15.000 --> 51:25.000
That's on Xbox 360. So, I think it's logical that they have to kind of put something out free. The subscription model for music isn't really working anymore, which is why I think Apple never ended up doing it.

51:26.000 --> 51:35.000
Although, maybe Apple can kind of get away with a lot of things that other companies can't. So, there you go.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
So, you'll check out Xbox Music. I keep forgetting there is a dashboard update. Like, we're due for one, aren't we?

51:41.000 --> 51:56.000
Probably. I'm going to guess at the end of this month. Get it out there so they can start banning people before Modern Warfare 3. No, Black Ops 2 comes out. Halo 4.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
They want to get those extra security checks in there before all those big games come out.

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
That's a good point. When is Halo 4's release?

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
Halo 4 is the 6th. Black Ops 2 is the 13th of November.

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
November. I guess that makes sense. We are in October now. It'll be just before Halo 4, maybe.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Lots of games.

52:16.000 --> 52:25.000
Yep. We'll get to the release date soon enough. Something else on the Xbox 360. One company is claiming that they are going to be soon heard on the Xbox 360 and seen.

52:25.000 --> 52:33.000
It's the site U-Porn. Never heard of this site. Can you believe that? A pornography site I haven't heard of. It's U-Porn. Oh, really?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I have the app on my Boxee Box.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
So, you can see some Boxee Box on your Boxee Box?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Except they don't ever use it because it's terrible.

52:44.000 --> 52:52.000
But, yeah. It's one of the... Come on. The Boxee Box had all these different repositories that you can get and a lot of them were porn.

52:53.000 --> 52:58.000
So, I had to download all the porn ones that were free because I'm not paying for fucking porn. Not doing it.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.000
But, yeah. We checked it out. It just links to their website. It looks exactly the same as the other one.

53:05.000 --> 53:13.000
It's a streaming website for porn. Of course, the name implies the YouTube of porn, sort of.

53:14.000 --> 53:20.000
Well, they posted an entry to their blog. Let's see. Quote... Oh, my gosh. Wait. I got to read this from chat.

53:21.000 --> 53:28.000
AlphaKananagram in our chat room at live.fognetwork.com says, Rob, I remember y'all talking about U-Porn on Guys on a Show.

53:29.000 --> 53:33.000
I'm pretty sure that was the site y'all went to for, quote, Japanese Fart Girl.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.000
How do you remember that? That's amazing. You remember things about my life I don't remember.

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
And U-Porn was also the website that we visited on your Wii using the Wii web browser to find pterodactyl porn.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
I thought that was PornTube.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
They're all the fucking same. I don't know. It was one of those.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
All right. Well, anyhow, here's the quote from U-Porn's blog.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Gamers and free porn lovers around the world rejoice. Yay!

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
Thanks at long last to the introduction of Internet Explorer for Xbox.

54:06.000 --> 54:11.000
You can now tap into and stream all your favorite free U-Porn videos right from your Xbox.

54:12.000 --> 54:19.000
Whether you're pwning noobs in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, annihilating Bullymong in Borderlands 2, or taking the saints deep in Madam NFL 13,

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
you're never more than a few simple controller clicks away from being face deep in hot free porn.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
Yes, because we all have the internet, so it's no big deal.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
Yay! So all they're really saying is, we can't wait for Internet Explorer on the Xbox 360.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.000
Who says it's gonna fucking work with your website anyways? Because it's Internet Explorer!

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I mean, it's like, that's not guaranteed to work with anything.

54:45.000 --> 54:57.000
I mean, I would hope that's HTML5, but I mean, come on. We know better than, you know, all these, you know, different web browsers for stuff don't necessarily work with the porn sites.

54:58.000 --> 55:05.000
Now, granted, the PlayStation 3 browser works well with porn sites, the Wii browser works well with the porn sites, so it is, they kind of have to at this point.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
But yes. And with that news, though, VoG Network is also on your Xbox 360, because...

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
There you go. It should work, it's HTML5, so it should work.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Assuming that Internet Explorer 8 works with HTML5.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
Are you gonna be able to code a website to show up like an Xbox channel?

55:21.000 --> 55:25.000
Or, not 8, 10. Um, maybe, I don't know about that.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Because we should make a VoG channel if that's possible. But anyway.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
I don't think it works that way.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
That'll happen as soon as the new OLR PSP debuts.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Yeah, except the PSP's over, so...

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
Oh, Bobby in Chat says it does not stream on the Xbox 360 Internet Explorer. I tried. I guess he's in some developer thing.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Oh, yeah, he has the X and A thing, so, yeah.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
So, we need to make it work, wah!

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
Alright, anyway. The official response from Microsoft, who are quick to distance themselves from this.

55:57.000 --> 56:07.000
To be clear, we are adding Internet Explorer to Xbox Live, not specific adult content providers like YouPorn or any other specific website content.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
Additionally, we give members and parents the option to turn this feature on or off for their accounts.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
Access to Internet Explorer for all child accounts is blocked by default.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
They want to get far away from a scandal ASAP.

56:22.000 --> 56:28.000
And who can blame them? Because honestly, you know, if Fox News got a hold of this little spiel here...

56:29.000 --> 56:32.000
Oh, they've done it with every single console that has a stupid web browser.

56:33.000 --> 56:38.000
It's a porn box! Xbox! Triple Xbox! I think they've already done that before.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
They'd have a pornography expert on with commentating, you know, whatever.

56:43.000 --> 56:49.000
I think they've already done that too before with, like, the Windows Media Center streaming or something like that.

56:49.000 --> 56:57.000
Because you used to build these Windows Media Center to, like, view what's on your computer and stream Internet Explorer or Firefox or something like that.

56:58.000 --> 57:06.000
Good Lord, Jason in chat says, Not to beat a dead horse, but Rob mentioned YouPorn in an Unprotected 6 too, I thought, referencing my old, old YouTube project.

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
What? I swear I have not heard of YouPorn, although I'm old and I forget things, so whatever.

57:13.000 --> 57:18.000
Some folks in chat, I think, kind of wondering if maybe the Kinect would allow you to make your own porn and you could upload it.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
It would look terrible. That camera is not good.

57:23.000 --> 57:32.000
Alright. Frisbee in chat says, I'm an Internet expert and I just found out that boobies are online.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
Maybe I'm doing the show topless right now.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Alright, Loki.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Seriously, porn, porn, porn.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
The Internet is for porn.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
I mean, come on. The Internet is for porn.

57:49.000 --> 57:56.000
So, apparently there are cheating allegations in the League of Legends playoffs. Basically...

57:57.000 --> 58:01.000
First you tell me there's boobs on the Internet and now you're going to tell me there's cheating?

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
I know, it's so crazy.

58:04.000 --> 58:12.000
Well, here's the most ridiculous part of the whole thing, is that they would even set it up that you could cheat.

58:12.000 --> 58:26.000
Basically, it looks like what happened was, I think it was screen hacking, which is basically looking at someone else's screen to, you know, look at their HUD and stuff like that to figure out where other people are on their mini-map.

58:27.000 --> 58:33.000
Basically, one of the referees said, we keep a constant watch on all the players on stage at all times.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
We have cameras as well as live people walking on the stage to keep tabs on everything.

58:38.000 --> 58:45.000
All players are told that they either remain sitting, facing forward with headphones on at all times, including during pauses.

58:46.000 --> 58:57.000
I can confirm that no WEE player looked at the mini-map at any point during the match, although they have a screenshot showing otherwise.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
So, I don't know.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But, here's my thing.

59:03.000 --> 59:17.000
If you're going to set up a tournament like that, and I didn't watch it live, so I don't know how exactly they're set up, but wouldn't you think that you would put the players in a way that they wouldn't be able to see the mini-map showing the other team?

59:18.000 --> 59:29.000
Just a thought, you know, maybe so that they can't look at, you know, the other team's screen, or they can't look at something that's being broadcast on, like, a giant screen in an arena or wherever the fuck this is.

59:29.000 --> 59:35.000
So, don't give them the opportunity, then you don't have to worry about them fucking, you know, cheating.

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Little mirrors on the side of my glasses allow me to see behind me and around me.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
I mean, seriously, it's just... it's stupid.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
But, it's for two million dollars, so of course some people are going to try to, you know, whatever they can do.

59:50.000 --> 59:56.000
And there was, you know, they were talking a little bit about, you know, what kind of made them suspect stuff.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Like, it ended up where one team was, I guess, pinging a spot in the map or whatever where the other team was, and basically there was no way for them to have known that those guys were there, but they knew that the players were coming from that direction or something like that.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
So, it's like, eh, wait a second, that's a little weird.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Well, what if it's just that, you know, maybe you kind of read up on the competition and maybe you know their strategies and stuff.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Like, I know those might be kind of a stretch here, but what if, you know, they just kind of... that's where they wanted to investigate and it was just a coincidence.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I mean, maybe I'm giving it too much credit, I'll be honest, but I don't know. It could happen.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I think you have to look at both sides. You don't want to just automatically assume everybody's a cheater.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Yeah, because here's one of the comments. They said, Azubu Frost did the same thing, only they paused the game, checked the map, and saw that the enemy team was going to ambush them, trying to counter the tactic that Azubu used in the past with the pause.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Azubu managed to mysteriously ping the exact brush TSM was in at the same time they were there, just after the pause. Coincidentally, eh?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So, I mean, it sounds like that they were... I don't know. A little funny business is going on.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Very interesting.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:25.000
But once again, you know, okay, apparently what it was is the map was being projected behind the players, you know, so people can see it and stuff, but put a fucking screen or something, you know, put that in a projection screen that's in front of the team.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Oh yeah, because you could maybe see the reflection in the monitor or something. It would be very easy.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:52.000
It just... come on, you're running a two million dollar tournament and you can't have decent... you're gonna go that, you know, that ghetto cheap on that stuff to where, oh well, you know, you know, people... fuck, even in regular tournaments that run well, people are gonna accuse other people of cheating. Just don't give them the opportunity. Especially when this much money is on the line.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Sometimes you don't think of everything. I don't know. Being devil's... we talked about... on Horde House this week we talked about a Guild Warcraft contest that went a little wrong because, you know, they didn't think about every possible thing that could happen.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Not to mention that they also... I think there was an issue where someone was D.O.S.ing the servers they were trying to use for...

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.000


01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
...for something, so they moved to, like, some different servers or something. I don't know. Fun!

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Alright, well let's move on. Something completely different. Something you can play with online to make your own chiptune music. I like little creative sites like this and this is pretty cool because this website kind of looks like a Game Boy and you can, you know, sequence your own tones, play them back, and save things to a WAV file so you can make your own cool little chiptunes.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:55.000
It is called Pulse Boy, if you want to check it out. It's pulseboy.com and I think it's called that because it looks like a Game Boy. It was made by Roger Hicks. So if you feel like kind of just messing around making your own chip... excuse me, your own chiptune songs, you can check out that website.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I don't know what else to say about it, but it looks pretty cool. I haven't had time to play with it myself yet, but I like those music making types of programs. Especially since there hasn't been a new Mario Paint.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That is a crime. They need to have that with a tablet controller. Come on. Still no Mario Paint. But now they have Art Academy. That's why. It's Art Academy now. Who cares? Mario Paint. I don't want Art Academy, I want Mario Paint.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Besides, there's GarageBand. You ever play GarageBand? Well it's not really a play thing, but it's a music making thing on the Apple products. Oh wow, the Apple products. Let me pull out all my... oh wait, don't have any because I don't buy expensive pieces of crap. I thought you had an iPod Touch. Yeah, don't use it.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:50.000
And I'm not paying twenty bucks for their fucking GarageBand. Five bucks. Five bucks. Might as well be twenty bucks. I had gift cards. Stop judging me. I'm not paying for anything.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and games that are coming out soon near you. This week is actually quite a bit because we're getting into the fall stuff and of course today Pokemon Black version 2 and Pokemon White version 2 out on the Nintendo DS.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Naughty Bear Double Trouble for the Playstation 3 includes Naughty Bear Gold Edition and Naughty Bear Trouble in Paradise. Both I'm sure are very underwhelming. Oh I love Naughty Bear, said nobody ever.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Yeah, pretty much. We played the original. It was terrible. Spy Hunters coming back on the Vita and 3DS. Just Dance 4 out this week on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and the Wii. Dragon Ball Z for Kinect. So now you can be over 9000.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Code of Princess for the 3DS. Also Harry Potter for Kinect. Monster 4x4 for the 3DS. The cool game this week Dishonored on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. And let's see, XCOM Enemy Unknown on Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I can't believe that series is coming back and it's probably going to look nothing like the original.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:20.000
The new one, well this is the strategy one so they don't have the third person shooter one yet. And then Fabled the Journey on Xbox 360 for Kinect. And god I wonder if that sucks or not. I haven't seen any reviews for that yet. But that's it.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Alright well traveling to Japan some of the same stuff on the Xbox 360 over there Dishonored. It comes out on the 360 October 11th as well as Fabled the Journey. Something must be going on with Rocksmith because there's a new cable and a cable bundle that are coming out in Japan as well. So Rocksmith must be landing in Japan. Either it already has or it's landing there soon.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:57.000
On the Playstation 3 pretty much all the same stuff I just named. Oh no just Dishonored in the Rocksmith thing. The other one isn't happening. But they also have Toki Toa comes out as well in a regular limited edition and Famitsu deluxe pack. Kind of interesting.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Anyhow I don't know what this is. This is some type of like a wedding is supposed to be a joyous occasion for Princess Toki and her knight. However the sneaky witch predicts that somebody is going to die at her wedding. Well that's kind of a downer isn't it?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:31.000
God this is kind of fucked up. To find out the connection between the witch, the assassin who crashed her wedding and to prevent her knight from dying, Toki and Toa travel back time 6 months before the wedding. The smooth transition between anime scenes and the battlefield gives gamers the illustration that they are being zapped into the game. Sounds like it could be kind of a neat concept actually.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Which means we'll probably never see it here. Oh it's kind of like a fighting game with the 1, 2, 3 combos and all that. It's pretty cool. Interesting. The art style on that is very automatic. I can see what they're talking about there. But yeah probably won't be seeing that here anytime soon but you never know.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Let's see. On the Playstation Vita, nothing this week but you do have FIFA 13 to look forward to on the 18th. And going to the 3DS real quick. There's a few things, quite a few things. Project X Zone, a Nintendo 3DS LL in blue and black which I believe is the XL. Bravely Default Flying Fairy from Square Enix. No idea what that could be but there you go.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And Game of the Week for many people I'm sure. Hello Kitty, Toa Iso, Block Crash Z. That means like Hello Kitty is like the Kool-Aid Man crashing through some blocks. I guess that's what that's all about. That's on the 3D. Still no mouth. Yes on the 3DS.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Going to the European release dates since Stark Soccer is not here. I'll try to jump in there and check out the European release dates. On October the 12th Dishonored on the 360, Playstation 3 and PC. Fabled the Journey on the Xbox 360.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Pokemon Black 2 and White 2 on October 12th. Rocksmith on the 360 and Playstation 3. Is that the initial release of the game there? Maybe they didn't have it before. WRC 3 on the Vita, Playstation 3, PC and 360. And XCOM Enemy Unknown across the 360, PS3 and PC. So a lot of the same stuff in Europe that we're getting here so they don't have to wait for a lot of that.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. I was going to add one more thing though. I got some news this week that was pretty awesome. And what's that? Cause my rep over at D3 knows I'm a huge Earth Defense Force fan.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Earth Defense Force 3 portable came out in Japan on the 27th of September. Being localized coming out over here February 12th as Earth Defense Force 2017 portable. Hell yes. Hooray! You're happy. I don't have to import it!

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:58.000
We knew there was a cult enough fandom for it here right? Oh yeah. You're not the only one that loves this series. I can't wait. And Earth Defense Force 4 hopefully is right around the corner. That I may import depending on how long it takes to get over here.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Well then I'm going to throw something out here too that was not in the news otherwise. And that is that it's confirmed that there's more DLC coming for Mass Effect for multiplayer. And it looks like one of the most robust ones they've done yet.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Like I guess there's going to be overall 16 new classes which seems crazy to me. I think they're rolling it out slowly or something. I think there's only 4 to start and then there will be more.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But new maps. It's some of the older maps with weather effects now and the weather will impact some things. But one of the biggest things that really surprised me. A fourth enemy race. Which is really cool and what the game could really use some of.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So you have the Geth, you have the Cerberus, you have the Reapers and now you're going to have the Collectors. Which was a big part of Mass Effect 2. That's coming back. So that's awesome.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I don't think we have a date for that yet do we? No maybe we do. It might be as soon as this Tuesday actually. I think it's coming out really soon. BioWare tends to announce these things and it's like by the way next week. Yay!

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Cool. So this is very sad. Apparently Sony is suing the fictional character Kevin Butler. And by suing the fictional character actually suing the actor that plays him, Jerry Lambert.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And apparently this is also, I think this has to do with their new commercial that he's in for Bridgestone. Because they're also suing them as well.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Basically he's playing Mario Kart on the Wii for that commercial. And so apparently I guess later on they edited the commercial and removed him from it entirely.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Which is kind of weird. And then I guess perhaps maybe there's some sort of clause or something that he couldn't be seen selling other products.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:11:04.000
They said the use of Kevin Butler character to sell products other than those from Playstation misappropriates Sony's intellectual property and creates confusion in the market and causes damage to Sony.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Although I don't think he was, I don't know if it was actually, he wasn't playing Kevin Butler in the commercial. He's just an actor. You can't sue because he's playing a different character that happens to be playing a video game or something like that.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It's not like he's like, I'm Kevin Butler with Sony. I'm playing Mario Kart.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Yeah, yeah, he didn't do that. But I mean, people did notice it was him and I'm sure there's a lot of people doing a double take. But it's like actors have to work and they have to take whatever jobs are offered to them.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:48.000
And if Sony cut him loose, then he should be free to look for other work elsewhere playing other characters. Like he can't not play a manager for the rest of his life because people might think it's the Sony guy.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Like, I don't know, that seems a little messed up to me. I think people usually know enough to know like, oh, it's the same guy. Maybe it's because Sony was trying to push so hard that Kevin Butler was like a real thing when they brought him out of the press conference a few years ago and so forth at E3.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Like maybe that's more what they're worried about, but that's kind of Sony that built that up, right?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Yeah, it's weird though because, I mean, at no point, from what I remember, at no point in that commercial did they ever refer to him as Kevin or refer to him as, like, anything. I don't know, it's just, it's weird.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Like, you know, most people know how to differentiate actors from one project to another. Like, just because somebody plays a villain in one movie doesn't mean they're like always a villain. Although I guess some people get, you know, typecast.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Like Daniel Radcliffe is not fucking Harry Potter.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
That's right, you're right, exactly.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
He's not Harry-

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
That's why he did that play with the nudie stuff, is he wanted to do something as-

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Women in Black is not Harry Potter and the Woman in Black. It is fucking, you know, a totally different movie. Just like, you know, just because this guy is in a commercial doesn't mean it's fucking Kevin Butler. And so that's my problem is, like, how can they even sue over this?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I mean, they can do whatever they want with her because they're Sony and they can bully whatever, you know.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Of course, I'll never forget the time I went to the theater. This was many years ago. I don't even remember what it was we were seeing, but I was with my friend Billy, who was a hoot and a holler. He was my old roommate when I lived in Chico, California.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:21.000
And we went to the movies and, you know, we're watching and then there's this new actress that pops on the screen in one scene and Billy goes very loudly, like, so the whole theater could hear,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:40.000
that's the woman that shot Selena. Like, she's an actress, okay. She had to take on a role of a person not a lot of people really care for, you know. Let her be other parts in other movies.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Like, when I watched Battlestar Galactica, I didn't go, oh, Selena's dad is a spaceship captain now. Wasn't that the teacher from Stand and Deliver?

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Anyhow, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see, Chiggers asks, can that guy ever do another commercial without thinking of him being Kevin Butler?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Well, I guess Loki gave a good example. Can you ever think of Daniel Radcliffe as anything but Harry Potter?

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:34.000
He's been in like other things, you know, the guy, let's play, you know, plays the fictional character Kevin Butler, but I was just really quickly, I was trying to watch the commercial real quick to see if he's got a name tag or if they refer to him as, actually, I'm going to do this real quick.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Well, let me read some other comments while you're working there. Frisbee in chat says, anyone who thinks Mario Kart is a Sony product, those people are crazy, yo.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:57.000
DungeonBuster says, it was funny seeing him push the Wii in the commercial, though. DungeonBuster says, the only thing I could think of was, it's nice to see Kevin Butler having fun with the Wii. Damn, I need new tires.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Success, the commercial was a success. It got you to think about tires and that you might need to take a trip to the tire store.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:12.000
SJ100Matt says, all I have to say is, no one cares about the dude you got a Dell guy anymore.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Yeah, they don't, they don't, they don't really even refer to him at all by any name at all. I mean, it's just, he's playing a character, so this whole lawsuit is fucking retarded.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:38.000
And I feel bad, after all the good shit, I mean, he was, he was like a spokesperson for, you know, Sony that actually kind of got people excited about Sony's stuff, and here's the way they go and treat him. Yeah, thanks.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Sony's had a lot of missteps in their advertising over the years, and Kevin Butler was one of the things they did right, and then they end it. They end it, and then they go, they go, they end it and then take a dump on it.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Hey, we're gonna fucking sue you because you're in a commercial for Bridgestone, playing a Wii. It's like, dude, you're the one that fucking let him go, you stupid idiot. He could have been still pitching, you know, Sony stuff, but you just said, eh, fuck it, we're getting rid of him.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Now, Bobby Blackwolf in the chat room says, actors generally have non, he's the voice of realism here, actors generally have non-compete clauses about not directly or indirectly promoting a competing product when they do ad work for a certain time.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:31.000
He might have violated his non-compete clause, which was in the contract that his agent should have known, but not him. But technically, I mean, just to play devil's advocate, technically, it was for the tire shop. The ad was not for a Wii, it was for the tire shop.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Yeah. So that's, that's where things get a little fuzzy wuzzy here. Like, I mean, what if he's, what if this Kevin Butler, keep calling Kevin Butler, it's not fucking Kevin Butler, it's an actual person. No, but what if, for example, you know, they, uh, he walks past, you know, what if Jerry Lambert walks past, like, an Xbox 360 or something that happens to be on, or they go, oh, whoa, hold on, you were, you were too close to another console.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:07.000
We're going to sue you. I mean, what if he gets a sitcom role or something like that and his kids are playing a fucking Xbox 360 or something?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:26.000
What Bobby's saying in chat, though, does make sense. I mean, like, okay, for example, Catherine Zeta-Jones was T-Mobile for how many years, right? Like, she was the reason a lot of people went to T-Mobile. She was a great spokesperson for that company. Why they ever let her go, I'll never know. But, like, it's not like she started doing commercials for AT&T right after that, you know?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Anyhow, but at the same time, if she, if she's talking on a cell, if she's talking on an iPhone in a movie, can T-Mobile sue her because they don't have the iPhone? That might be stretching it a little bit, right?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It's, I think it's ridiculous. But apparently, apparently, if there's anything out of it, they're going to try to settle out of court, so.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
All right.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
It's, it's stupid.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:06.000
All right, one more news story for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, and this has to do with a old class, ironically, into the classic game of the week. This is not the classic game of the week, although I think it should be if it hasn't been yet at some point.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Suikoden, one and two. Great PlayStation role-playing games. Actually, there were five of them, but a lot of people remember very fondly the first two that were on PlayStation.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And this Facebook group, the Suikoden Revival movement, is a group that's trying to organize to get Konami's attention to get Suikoden one and two available on PlayStation Network worldwide.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Now I was trying to get to the bottom of this because I'm like, wait a minute. I have Suikoden on PlayStation Network. I bought it several years ago, so I know that's already there.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
But this is, I suppose, a campaign to get it done worldwide. My understanding is that Suikoden one is not available in Europe.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Suikoden two is kind of a rare game, too. I mean, like, people pay a lot of money to get copies of that game if you can actually find it anywhere.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So it would be, although it would suck for the collectors to have it devalued a little bit, it's not like that kind of stuff hasn't happened before.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So a lot of people asking, well, where's Suikoden two, which some people say was the best that was in the series. It is a little odd that that is missing.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:18.000
So there is a fan campaign going on on Facebook, and it's basically, you know, kind of like Operation Rainfall-esque, where it's like, bug Konami on Twitter on Tuesday.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Bug Konami on Facebook on Friday, and like, just keep banging down their door until they get you what you want to shut you up.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Facebook.com slash Suikodenrevival is the place to check that out. S-U-I-K-O-D-E-N-R-E-V-I-V-A-L.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:40.000
If you feel like joining in on the campaign, which I bet Shane is going to sign up for right now, although he probably already has the games on PlayStation.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Wasn't there PSP remakes in Japan, too? I think I remember that.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Ah, maybe.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:53.000
And then, is one and two really good enough, or don't you want three, four, and five at some point, now that they're putting PlayStation 2 games out on the, uh, PlayStation Network?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Eh?

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Alright.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Well, let's move on to a time when gaming was a lot simpler, and you didn't get to petition companies to tell them what you want.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.000
You took what you wanted, you took what you got, and you liked it.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Every week on the show, Dark Sakura picks a classic game from the gaming vault that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this game.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But she's not here. She's too busy on the Matterhorn.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:24.000
So I'm jumping in and taking the classic game, because Loki never told me if he wanted to do it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Alright, so I'm going to do the classic game tonight, and I try to pick things that I think Dark Sakura may not have heard of, and things that I remember from my past.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:37.000
So the classic game of the week I picked this week is an edutainment title, a little different.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
It's called The Island of Dr. Brain is my classic game of the week.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Now, really we should kind of consider Dr. Brain as a series, because The Island of Dr. Brain was not really the first game in this series.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The Castle of Dr. Brain was the first game in this series.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
But, um, Dr. Brain was a series that had, I think, four games in it.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:06.000
There was, um, uh, there was The Island of Dr. Brain, The Castle of Dr. Brain was before that, and then later on, like about three years later, we had The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And The Time Warp of Dr. Brain, although I don't remember those games as fondly.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:22.000
And I think part of that is because Sierra, who actually created those first two games, uh, created those in-house, but then they acquired Bright Star Technology, who was known for educational games.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It got turned over to them, they made The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain and The Time Warp of Dr. Brain.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:39.000
So, um, Dr. Brain is an absent-minded professor, and, uh, basically the idea to the, in the games is to kind of follow Dr. Brain and kind of find him wherever he is.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Obviously, The Island of Dr. Brain is kind of a play on The Island of Dr. Moreau, like the classic movie that then they remade into a terrible movie, and so forth.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Um, later on, they actually remade this whole series into like more of an action-oriented game, which was Dr. Brain thinking games and action-reaction, but I'm not really acknowledging those.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Let me go back to The Island of Dr. Brain, which is the game I wanted to talk about tonight.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Um, The Island of Dr. Brain was, um, kind of a adventure-ish game.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:19.000
The, the cool thing about it is it felt like a lot of the old Sierra games around that time, and kind of had that same look to it, where you were adventuring and exploring things in the different screens and such.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:26.000
But you had many different puzzles that you had to solve to get further and further in The Island, and there were many types of different puzzles.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:35.000
There was, um, there was like, um, uh, like Tetris, Tetro-Teturino Onimo, I forget what they call those, those types of puzzles.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000
The classic Tower of Babel-style puzzles, where you're moving the little towers from one pole to another.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Graphing calculator puzzles, where you had to get the exact, thank you, Tetromino, uh, where you had to get the, um, graph to draw just right to separate the four types of little amoebas under the microscope.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Um, latitude and longitude puzzles, there were all these different types of puzzles in the game.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And, um, basically, in the plot of the game, the plans for the latest project were stolen, and you have to get the battery from The Island and bring it to Dr. Brain to basically fix the situation.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
There's security puzzles that Dr. Brain set up all over The Island, though, that is what you're solving.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:23.000
So, uh, yeah, it was a Sierra game, it was for DOS back in 1992, and although it was kind of an educational title, I don't know, I kind of like puzzle games.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
It kind of set the precedent, um, for a lot of, like, fun, uh, puzzle games.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So, that's really it, that's all I have to say about it.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
There's not a lot else to say, it's, it's got a variety of different types of puzzles in it, and it's, it's worth checking out.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And the, uh, prequel as well, The Castle of Dr. Brain was also a solid entry in the series.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000
So there you go, this week's classic game of the week, The Island of Dr. Brain.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Check out those old school voiceovers right there with the ad-lib music in the background.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Good times.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
The Island of Dr. Brain, did you ever play that one?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I did not play that game.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I'm wasting many hours on that game.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
It's a fun game.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
There's different skill levels, too, so the puzzles can get really hard.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Like, I think the Tower of Babel puzzle in the advanced mode takes, like, 450 moves to solve.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Crazy.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Alright, that's gonna do it for this first half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000
We have plenty more of show to come, including rapid-fire news, the FUGL Question of the Week, emails, if we got any,

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000
there weren't any in there last time I looked, uh, the FUs of the Week, and of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Maybe you have something to say about this whole Kevin Butler situation, or Cliffy B leaving Epic Games,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
or porn on the 360, or whatever you want to talk about.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
We'll be taking your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:55.000
We are live with episode number 476 of our show for this October the 7th of 2012.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Just myself and Loki holding down the fort tonight, if you're just joining us, DarkSakura.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:06.000
She is at the happiest place on Earth, which is even happier today, uh, with the gay days Anaheim going on right now.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I know a lot of people that are there right now.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Uh, and you might be wondering, why aren't you there?

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Um, my pass expired for Disney. I had an annual pass for Disneyland.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
It actually expired at the end of September, so I wouldn't have been able to make it.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And, um, it's like $450 or something to renew right now, which, you know, if I was in a better financial situation,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
I'd spend it, because that's, you know, Disneyland's a great place.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000
But, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna use the excuse to kind of take some time off from Disney for a while.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I was just there two weeks ago, anyway. That was the point, was to be like the last hurrah.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
So, uh, but, uh, Jamie, she's, she's enjoying it for now, uh, while I'm on a little bit of hiatus,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
and, uh, she'll be back next week to pick a new Classic Game of the Week and do all the things she does on the show.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
But, meanwhile, Loki and I holding down the fort.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Alright, Loki, you gotta tell the, uh, listeners what you were telling me during the break about your shopping excursions here.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I'm not shopping on anything. No, I, I'm making some, well, designing something right now.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Sorry, plotting. You're plotting something over there, clearly.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Not necessarily shopping. Uh, so, no, I was, um, you know, I'm always looking for, like, DDR machines and stuff like that.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
So, one of the things I wanted to do was rebuild my, you know, DDR pads.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And, you know, I, I kind of saw only all the designs that are out there and stuff.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I actually had bought stuff to make a certain, uh, design, but I just kind of don't want to do that one anymore.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So, I happened to catch, there was, um, on the, on BomaniSau's, um, site, they were, uh, some guy was selling one of his beat gear pads.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:47.000
And now, if you don't remember, beat gear pads, at one time, there was a guy that was gonna be creating the most arcade authentic pads, you know, out there.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And then we played some awesome music, and it was fantastic.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Okay, I guess, um, I guess, uh, it was appropriate, since Loki's talking about old games, to play the classic Game of the Week music. Sorry about that.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Uh, so anyways, so this guy's selling, um, you know, the beat gear pad, and, uh, they've got some shots of it and stuff, and that kind of linked to another website that had some more shots of the pad, and, like, it taking apart and stuff like that.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:27.000
So, based on those pictures, I'm designing the schematics for it to make my own, or to mass produce them if I want to, since no one has done it. And, yeah, so that's why I'm working on it.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
But you wouldn't scam people out of their money.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
No.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
You're an honest guy, and I know where you live.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Exactly, everyone knows where I live. No, um, I just, I was kind of curious to see how much it's gonna cost to do it, and how I would actually have to do it, because I think it's all, it looked like it was injected molded plastic and stuff.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And they use different sensors than, like, arcade sensors. They use, uh, they're tape switches, or what they're called, I guess, and you can actually buy those really cheap.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:10.000
They come in, like, a big, long, like, a big, long string of them, and it's, like, uh, I think I found them, like, ten bucks for, like, eight feet of that stuff, and you'd only need, like, a few inches, um, per pad.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Maybe a few feet per pad. Um, but, I mean, ten bucks for, you know, a ton of switches versus ten bucks a switch.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Kind of a, kind of a big deal there. But, um, yeah, so, arcade parts, they actually use the arcade arrows. They use, um, the way I'm designing is gonna use the arcade, um, neons as well.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Um, and I don't know about the arcade switches, because those are really fucking expensive. I'd rather go the tape switch route.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
You'll always be the DDR fan, now and forever.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Exactly. I always am. All I have the stuff I do is for DDR stuff.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I did it for the dinner!

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.000
But, yeah, so, that's what I've been working on. Actually, that's what I've been working on this week, uh, last few days, and I've been playing Minecraft or anything, or Borderlands 2,

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:05.000
because I've been, uh, playing in SketchUp, trying to draw what I see, and getting the measurements right based on other things that are injection molded and stuff like that.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You know, they have the support braces and stuff in there. Um, just getting that the right size, and I think I have nailed it pretty well.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Um, just knowing measurements of different things. So, we'll see.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I mean, the thing about injection molding stuff is it may be somewhat cheap for the parts, but the initial cost is pretty expensive.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:35.000
So, it may not even be, by the time I'm done, worth it doing, because to make the parts would be a few thousand dollars.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Which, you know, it's good if you're mass producing them, because then, you know, you cost average all that stuff out, and it gets pretty cheap.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But, if you're making, like, one pad or two pads, that might not work out too well.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
You know, it'd be well over the cost of a DDR machine. What's the point at that point?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Alright, well, before we get into rapid-fire news, to take things a slightly different direction for a minute, I like some of this reminiscing people are doing in the chat room.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:10.000
They're talking about this service, Imagination. I personally never heard of that one, but they're talking about some of the other old, like, old-school dial-up services and things that used to exist back in the day.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Qlink. I remember that one. Wasn't that actually called QuantumLink, and then I think they shortened it to Qlink?

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I don't know.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I was on the Commodore 64, and I want to say that became America Online at some point, or AOL Bottom or something.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Maybe.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I remember that, and I always wanted to get on that with my 300 baud modem.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
But, my parents, you know, I was only, like, probably eight at the time, didn't want me on that stuff.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
But, Vandy brought up Genie and Prodigy.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I was on Prodigy.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I was on Prodigy, too, and I still remember my number to this day. I know I've talked about it on a previous show.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
I got in a lot of trouble thanks to Prodigy chat rooms.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Oh, yeah. Well, I got in trouble just, I think, because one of the Prodigy numbers it dialed was a long-distance number, and we were on it for, like, a long time.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Oh, crap.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000
So, it, like, you know, it ranked up a pretty big phone bill.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000
But, yeah, the earliest modem I had was just a 2400 baud modem.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
But, yeah, BBS's. That was some good times.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Oh, I spent so much time on BBS's back in the day.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
It's crazy.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And BBS's wouldn't suddenly disconnect the stream, like, apparently just happened here.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
What is up?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
That's a Comcast issue, guys. It's not us. I'm sorry.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
We should be back online now, though. It shows the streaming data.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
But, where were we?

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Oh, BBS's.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I used to call so many BBS's when I was, like, 12 to 15.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Where were we back? What did you used to have? Was it the California Computer News Magazine?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Yes.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Was it a free magazine?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
You and I probably hung out on the same BBS's and didn't even know it.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Maybe.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Probably. I'll try to think. What were some of the big, my favorite BBS back in the day in the Sacramento area was one called the Open Mind.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I still remember it to this day. But it was huge on the forums.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000
And there were a lot, it had a very active forum community. I met a lot of great people on there.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And then there was one you could dial into to play Doom 2 online.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But that was the one where you had to buy credits after you used so much.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I can't remember some of the big ones that were here locally, but I used to play all that shit.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Legend of the Red Dragon, Trade Wars 2002, The Pit with its graphical client. Amazing.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.000
There was one BBS I used to dial into that actually would let you have internet access for, like, 15 minutes a day.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:27.000
That was fantastic. And then also all the AOL discs. I mean, you would just be swimming in those things.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
You'd go cancel. Hey, would you like another free month?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Yeah, sure. Free month.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I remember asking and begging my mom to let me call the long distance number to the Sierra BBS for, like, 20 minutes so I could download a game demo that I really wanted.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
I don't even remember what it was now, but there was something on there that I really wanted because Sierra had an official BBS back in the day.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Good times. Dial back verification. All that good stuff.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I tried running a BBS, but my parents would never let me have the second line.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:04.000
So it was one of those, you know, my really good friend Neil could call in when we set up a certain time.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
And then my mom would pick up the phone to call one of her friends. Rob, what the hell are you doing?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Good times.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Alright, let's move on. Enough reminiscing. Let's talk rapid fire news.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Loki, start us off.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Alright, I'm very excited about this game coming out. It's been a long, long time coming.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Retro City Rampage, which originally started off as a Grand Theft Auto game for the NES and then just spun out from there.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
And it has so many homages to, like, just all this 8-bit stuff.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
You know, they've got everything you could possibly think of.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:50.000
They have levels there based off of Metal Gear, levels based off of Breakthrough, levels based off of, you know, Bionic Commando, Mega Man, Blaster Master, all sorts of crazy stuff.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
It's going to be coming out on the PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
They're doing the cross-buy thing too with that, so that's where I'm purchasing it.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Although I do also want it on my Xbox 360 and maybe on Steam.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.000
So I may actually purchase it on every single platform that comes out.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
But it's $14.99, so that'll be coming out this week on the 9th.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I can't wait. That'll probably be the game I'm playing this week.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:21.000
And it's very much like a Grand Theft Auto 1 or 2 type game top down, but it's just all sorts of crazy.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:26.000
There's like Super Meat Boy stuff in there. There's a Super Meat Boy game that's done like the Virtual Boy in the game.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
So it's going to be fantastic.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Also this week, well, one of the announcements, I guess, Namco Bandai is removing Nobby Nobby Boy from the iOS App Store, also on Tuesday.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And apparently they haven't really said why it's being removed. It is being removed by Namco Bandai, not Apple.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
But apparently, you know, there's some functionality that hasn't been working for a few months.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.000
So maybe they've just decided that, eh, we're going to get rid of it or something.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:07.000
It's kind of sad. But if you want to play the game, I guess download it now so you have it.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
And it is $1.99.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And then there's a new Kickstarter. I actually saw this one. The Kickstarter for Old School RPG.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
It's being created by Brenda Brathwaite and Tom Hall.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Who, you know, you may not remember them, but of course they worked on some of the older game series like Wizardry and Dungeons & Dragons.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I was like, Brenda Brathwaite actually sounds very familiar. She was like an old school RPG person, right?

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Yeah, and then Tom Hall was the founder of id Software. He made Commander Keen.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Holy shit, Commander Keen. That's one of those demos I downloaded for 30 minutes on my 24-14 board.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Man, one of the things I liked doing was we had a local video store that had a shareware table.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:06.000
A table where you just buy floppy disks of all sorts of games. Good times, man.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:13.000
It blows my fucking mind how I'm in junior high school, right? I guess it was more like freshman, sophomore year of high school.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I'm downloading the Wolfenstein 3D demo for 50 minutes. It takes me to download that demo on a 14 4K modem, right?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Flash forward to today, which, you know, I'm not that old all things considered, but this is maybe 20 years later.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I'm downloading Wolfenstein 3D to play on my phone over the air in less than a minute.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Think of where we're going to be 20 years from now.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Not even.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Raisy shit.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Like five years from now.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Crazy shit. Anyhow, sorry.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:54.000
So yeah, so apparently if you pledge, you know, 15 bucks, you'll get a digital copy of the game.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And of course they've got all sorts of different things. They even have a $10,000 pledge point where they will show up to your door with a red velvet,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:08.000
or deliver the game in a box on a red velvet pillow on a red carpet. So that's pretty funny.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And, you know, they also had one of their stretch goals is that they'll make two full games.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
So neat.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Also DLC Quest, the game we kind of talked about a while, I actually played it on the indie games, but it's one of the games that's on the whole green light thing.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:33.000
And one of their promises if they get green lit is that they're going to add some new content, which is good, because that game's only like one or two hours long.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And the new DLC is going to be called Live Free-mium or Die.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:47.000
And they have, I guess, a new campaign world, or a new campaign, new world, new enemies, and buckets of new DLC to purchase.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:55.000
And they're saying that that set the launch the fourth quarter of this year, which is pretty funny.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
And yeah. And then that's it.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Alrighty. I got a few stories for you guys as well. First off, something about Star Wars Final Assault.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Hopefully this will be one of the Star Wars games that isn't terrible. Because they're hit and miss. Sometimes they're really good, sometimes they're really not good.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:24.000
But Star Wars Final Assault will be coming out on Xbox Live Arcade. There is an image out there floating around of the actual artwork that will be used on the arcade.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:31.000
That's kind of how they spilled it there. So the game was first announced way back in August when there were trademark and domain registrations.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But this game, it's funny to note, still has not been officially announced. So we don't even really know exactly what it is.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yeah, they haven't announced it. It came out of a leak. There was a leak of all the fourth quarter titles that were coming out on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
And there's actually some other ones I saw that were interesting, but I don't remember what it was.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Well, could one of them be this game I'm going to mention next? Karate Kia? I could never say this. It's basically Karate. Karate Ka. I guess that's the way you would say it. Karate Ka.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I remember this old, old game. This was back in the Commodore 64 days and all that. And it was in the arcades too.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:15.000
There's a remake now coming out. Obviously it's now 3D, a little more inspired by the Street Fighter IVs of the world and so forth.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000
But still kind of cool that it's on Xbox Live Arcade. It's small enough to be there.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Xbox.com actually had this posted. It wasn't supposed to be an official announcement, but people that were scouring Xbox.com actually found it.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:41.000
This one is supposed to be out I believe relatively soon. November-ish is when that remake is coming out. November 16th? 14th? 14th that link is to be believed that was found on Xbox.com.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:53.000
This fad isn't going to die anytime soon. It's the Gangnam Style dance. Ah yes. It's now available to your character in Free Realms.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:40:03.000
You might remember Free Realms as the free-to-play MMO that's available on the Playstation 3. It sucks. But hey, you can do this dance in the game.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Here's what I love about the trailer. They can't use the actual music. Oh son of a bitch. I don't care about the E.T. re-release. Show me the frickin' movie I really want to see.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And they don't have walkie-talkies anymore. That's important. Even on the Blu-ray version? I thought they went back to it. No they got rid of it I think.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:29.000
I thought Spielberg said he regretted that. Do we need to have a conversation about E.T.? No. Alright here we go. Here's the actual trailer. They have to use fake music.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Even though it's the actual dance. Here's the problem with this. Not only is Free Realms kind of crap, but let's be real. The moment that sold that video for most people was when he was dancing over the guy in the elevator.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000
That was the best part of the entire video and I don't see that represented here in Free Realms.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And everybody's saying why aren't the panda bears doing this in Mists of Pandaria? Well cause they programmed that dance in like nine months ago way before Gangnam Style was a thing.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And there you have it. Apparently a Wii U demo interface has been shown. This is because the Wii U demo kiosk is now available in the official store in New York City.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.000
So I don't know if some of our New York City fans are nearby and want to check that out, but you can check that out. It's a Wii U demo station.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And it has some of the cover art for some of the various games there. You can select whatever demo cover art you want to play and you get a video or you get to actually play the demo depending on what it is.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Apparently only Rayman Legends is actually usable, but who knows. I mean this is still really early on. The console is still a good month and a half away.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:46.000
So I imagine they'll add more to this. But that's available at the official Nintendo store. So those of you that are in New York might want to check that out.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Alright, let's move on to the foogle question of the week.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Rama the ever great reporter for VOG says he'll go by there tomorrow. Check it out. Get on it Rama.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Alright, foogle question of the week. Very simple this week. I thought I'd tie it into what we talked about at the beginning of the show.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:24.000
What's the scariest video game you've ever played and why? Easy enough right? We talked about this at the beginning of the show.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Let's go to Facebook. I always start on Google Plus. We'll go to Facebook this week and start off here.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Ronnie B says condemned criminal origins. Based on the demo it had I fully went in expecting something like a CSI sim and that's what I wanted. Nothing more.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:45.000
The demo focused a lot on using forensic tools and being a cop so I thought great. The longer you play the crazier it got though.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000
James S. replied there's another game on PC that I haven't played but would love to like Amnesia or Slenderman.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
My computer is ancient so I have to go with a console game. I know it sounds cliche but Silent Hill 2 and 3 collection.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Was phenomenal. I can't remember how many times I had to turn it off when playing alone at night because I was literally dreading turning around that next darkened corner.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Freaky music in the background and none of the stupid team co-op stuff to ruin it. These games are more scary when we are completely and utterly alone.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:20.000
With that being said there aren't really many AAA horror titles that are genuinely scary. Maybe they just don't make enough money. What a shame.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Acidic Vampire says Dead Space 1 and 2. Disfigured creatures a la John Carpenter's The Thing aboard a derelict spacecraft. Need I say more?

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Shattered Hawk says as a kid I used to own Shadow Man for the N64. The music mixed with monsters gave me nightmares. The pig guys with the hooks that screamed when they spotted you still gives me the chills.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:54.000
I never played that game but that sounds scary. Tim N says Silent Hill 2. It is peerless as far as horror goes. The rest are pretenders.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Some strong words there. Gamer Girl says I know you only asked for one but I have two. Eternal Darkness was really scary for me.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I don't know but when you get to the part where your heart starts racing in game it was over for me in real life. Why? Because I'm a huge music lover. I feel whatever I'm listening to.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Same goes for F.E.A.R. Those are two of the most scariest games for me. But somehow I still love it. Dan Shadow says the original F.E.A.R. was really creepy. The first few missions had great jump scares and you didn't.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:34.000
He spoils part 2. You'll have to read that on Facebook to see that. Mike B says Jaws Unleashed. It was scary bad. I knew somebody would go with the Showgirls route.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I thought Jaws wasn't that bad. I don't know if it was Unleashed though. Wasn't that the remake one where you can play as the shark OMG. The shark one looked fun.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Dave Falcon said return to Castle Wolfenstein. There was a small part in the game that just startled the crap out of me during gameplay. I was walking through a snowy field and everything was quiet and calm and the Nazis jumped out of nowhere and made me jump out of my skin. Shot the crap out of me. Nazis always scare me.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Another vote for Silent Hill 2 from Clover N. Chiggers says Bioshock had a moment that scared the shit out of me. One of those zombie dudes jumped out from behind a coffin and made me drop the controller. Fucking zombies. Bioshock was really scary.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:31.000
DDR Dollar Bill says Haunted house on the 2600. When you could not see the walls at all, no weapons and could not even see behind the doors. Drop my damn controller every time I opened one and a damn spider or bat or ghost killed me. Quite honestly I'd like to see a follow up of scariest moments.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Haunted house on the 2600 was kind of old school survival horror. I think they remade that for the 360. Yeah and it's shit. Yeah.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:52.000
And DJ Rama S replied and said Bioshock. And a very similar story to what Chiggers had mentioned before with somebody popping out there. He said well played 2k games well played. Let's go to Google Plus and look at some of the answers there.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Marcus E says Haunting ground. Even though the Capcom game focuses on a busty gal running around like some horror flick, it managed to be much deeper. Any game where your only option is to run seems scary by default.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:18.000
But the atmosphere in Haunting Ground was fantastic. Pair that with supremely creepy stalkers, foreboding locations and a terrifying soundtrack and the game was one of the best horror titles.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:34.000
I must give you one example of how the game managed to be so scary. Haunting Ground focuses on hiding since you can rarely fight back. At one point I was running from an antagonist, rushed down a hallway into a room and went to hide in the closet.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Guess what? She was in the closet waiting for me. Moments like that just made the game near perfect.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Act Def says Aside from Silent Hill, Eversion. That game is really fucked up and so much too. Lastly, Redertainment says Silent Hill 3. I had to stop playing that game near the end so the fear that was building up on my body could leave me. I occasionally still hear the sounds of those damn demon dogs.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:12.000
So there it is. The answers from Facebook and Google Plus. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or you can look us up on Google Plus if you want to answer in a future week.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Some things I was surprised not to hear. Did you notice some of the games that were left out? I heard one person mention Amnesia but didn't pick that as their most scary. No Resident Evils. I didn't hear Clock Tower which I always thought was kind of a fucked up.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I don't know. I kind of thought it was scary. Fatal Frame. Kind of a lot of stuff that wasn't there but still some good picks. I'm not saying you guys didn't pick good stuff but lots of love for Silent Hill apparently.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:48.000
There you go. Alright, there it is. Your FUGL Question of the Week. Let's get back into some more news. We're not too far away from the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR. Not just yet though. Some more news stories first.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So Sony likes doing a lot of different bundles, especially around the holidays. And one of the things that they said they, eh, we're not not going to do it but it might be a cool idea.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Apparently they're thinking that hey maybe someday we'll do a bundle that includes a Vita and a Playstation 3. And I think that could be possible if they have some more of those games that are going to be kind of working like the Wii U or the Xbox Smart Glass stuff.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:30.000
So maybe if that becomes popular they might do this. It'd have to get a hell of a lot cheaper though because it's going to be a hard sell to have a portable system and a regular system in there.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Yeah, that bundle is going to have to be a heck of a deal but it's going to look like, you know, twice as much as the Wii U.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Yeah. I don't know. It'd be neat. Right now they don't have a whole lot of interconnectivity between the two systems. Some games, you know, kind of use it but not a whole ton.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000
But they could.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:08.000
They could. They could do anything. They could bundle it with a TV. I'm sure they've done that. So, I don't know. It's not outside the realm of possibility but is it going to be something that people are going to be looking for? Probably not.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Options. I remember people like options.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Well some options people would like to see on the Wii U is more variety in games and some more things that address the hardcore.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:26.000
And of course follow ups to some of those big Operation Rainfall games, The Last Story and Xenoblade.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Well, Reggie Fils-Aime made a comment, I believe this was to, I think it was to Kotaku actually, about Xenoblade and The Last Story and all that.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.000
The comment was about what is Monolith Soft doing now? What is the Wii U game that they're making?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And the quote is this, quote, we know that they're working on a game. I personally haven't seen it but I know there's a lot of excitement in Japan and Kyoto about what they're working on.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:01.000
So I look forward to seeing it. In the end, if it's a game that we decide to publish from what would be a second party standpoint, certainly we'd love to bring it here to the US.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:09.000
The way we look at the opportunity is, given a level of marketing support, how much are we going to sell and is it going to be a profitable venture?

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:16.000
So a whole lot of nothing kind of about, you know, maybe we'll release it, maybe we won't.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I found some of the comments on this particular website a little more interesting than the article itself.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
MyNintendoNews.com is where some of these comments come from.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
And some people are kind of talking about, like they're fighting about, did Xenoblade do well or not?

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
One commenter says, I bet the Wii U game will do well since Xenoblade did well.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.000
And somebody replies to that, it did well, it barely sold 300,000 copies in North America.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I put it this way, and I just saw this this week.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Yeah?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
The last story, it's out of print. They're not making it anymore.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Oh shit.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000
But that was something that was being put out by Exceed, so it's kind of their MO.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Atlas does the same thing, you know, they kind of make a small initial lot and then they sell through it and put it out of print.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
But, I mean, I don't think they sold that well.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Well, somebody replies though, and this is a good point.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Okay, 300,000 doesn't seem that bad when you consider it was only available at two places.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Nintendo's website or GameStop.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:15.000
No Amazon, no Walmart, no Best Buy, none of that.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But it doesn't matter though, for the people that wanted that game, they could get it there.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And let's be honest, GameStop is the largest game retailer out there, so...

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000
300,000 doesn't seem that bad to me though, when you put it in that context.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000
It's not that bad. It's not. I mean, there's been multi-platform games that sold under that hell.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Earth Defense Force, you know, Insect Armageddon sold under 300,000 copies per platform.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
There you go.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
So, I mean, it makes sense.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
But the other bottom line of that is that...

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Sorry, I lost my train of thought.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
The other bottom line of that is that...

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Damn it, where was I going with this?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
This is where live radio bugs...

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
That they're going to actually bring it over?

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Yeah, or I guess that maybe the decision hasn't been made yet.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And if it's going to take...

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Yeah, that's where I was going with this, is that even if they decide they're going to do it,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
you're not going to see it anytime soon.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Yeah.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Bobby Blackwolf wants to correct something you said.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
He says Walmart is the largest game retailer, and I believe it.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:22.000
GameStop may be the largest specialty retailer, but Walmart is the largest retailer of a lot of things.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Well, they're the largest retailer of, you know, retailer out there.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
But as far as game specialty as, you know, category, GameStop is far beyond Walmart.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Walmart may sell through a lot of stuff, but the biggest chunk is going to GameStop.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
That's why you see a lot of special stuff being done for GameStop, like a lot of exclusives.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
You don't see Walmart exclusives for that stuff. On movies, though, you do.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000
You do. You do see some Walmart exclusive things. Rarely, but you do.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And I would argue that you probably do see more actual games at the end of the day sold at Walmart than you do at GameStop.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Same thing with the CDs.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
You wouldn't think Walmart's the largest CD retailer in the world, but they are.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Maybe with iTunes in the picture, it's a little different now, but the largest physical CD retailer in the world.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
They're the largest retailer of a lot of stuff, like it or not.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
So...

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Anyhow, that's all I wanted to say about that.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Let's move on, Loki.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Alright.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
So, let's see.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
This is kind of neat.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
AbleGamers, you know, they're dedicated to gamers with different disabilities and stuff.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:31.000
They're actually going to open up an arcade, an accessibility arcade.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And I guess the concept that was originally, I guess, going to be a...

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
It was originally a limited time installation, but they're saying this is going to be a permanent addition to the Washington, D.C. Public Library.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I guess the Martin Luther King branch.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:55.000
And it's going to allow different gamers with all sorts of different disabilities to be able to enjoy games.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:02.000
So you're going to see games with, you know, maybe some audio-only games.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
You know, that kind of stuff in there.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:13.000
And they haven't really said what specific types of games are going to be in there, but I can kind of imagine the stuff that they have.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000
And I guess this is opening very soon.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Or, actually, by the looks of it, it's already open.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Oh, wow.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.000
That's pretty cool.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Now, this is in Washington, D.C.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
No, I'm sorry. It opens this Wednesday.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
By the time a lot of people hear this, it'll be open.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Or book their flights to Washington, D.C.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Where this is at, apparently, right?

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Yeah.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Well, that's pretty neat.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Especially when you hear every day how arcades are dying.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.000
And just last week, we had a story on the show about another major arcade that was shutting down.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.000
It's nice to hear that not only is something opening up, even though this is...

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I mean, it's a library and all that stuff, so it isn't like an arcade in the traditional sense.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.000
It's neat that not only is something opening up, but it's opening up with a broader idea in mind.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
And something new.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Yeah.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Which, you know, now we look at it and go, oh, this is something we should have had all along, but this is a great idea.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Well, let's hope it does well for them.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Maybe it'll start a trend.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:23.000
But sadly, I think with how arcades have been doing recently, I think the trend has already been had.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Anyhow, there were a few Nintendo Direct conferences this week that talk about the 3DS.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:33.000
And we get to find out what's in store for the 3DS this year.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000
I guess there's a sequel being made to Pushmo, Ninja Gaiden and Castlevania the Adventure,

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
and some other games developed by Level 5 and so forth.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
There's some good stuff that's actually, like, original.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Night Sky is coming out October 25th.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:56.000
That is an action-puzzle game that will be an ambient gameplay experience with cerebral challenges that will be uniquely designed picturesque worlds.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000
By the way, these are all e-shot titles. I probably should have put that out there, too.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Crashmo is the sequel to Pushmo on November 22nd.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Fluidity Spin Cycle is on December 27th.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
This is going to make use of the tilt.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Like, not a lot of games have been using the gyroscope in there.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:22.000
This will have, like, tilt and turn and all that stuff to maneuver a puddle of water named Eddie through a maze-like world.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
But it's the whole, like, you can do liquid to ice or steam, solid liquid gas type of thing.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Wow, that sounds just like that one game that Konami put out. Remember?

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Yeah, I remember that. I remember that.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Dewey's Adventure?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Nintendo e-shops will get Level 5 stuff.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Suda51's Liberation Maiden.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:48.000
A hundred years in the future when the president of Japan boards her liberator Kamui and fights to free her country one region at a time.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Arrow Porter and Crimson Shroud are also on the table to be released by the end of the year.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And Pedestrian Tossing Pandemonium in Tokyo Crash Mobs, an action-puzzle game in early 2013.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
There you go.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
There are also some 3DS titles that are full games that are now available for download.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Star Fox 64 3D, Mario Kart 7, all coming on October 18th for $39.99 each.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Most of those you can start to find in the bargain bins for far cheaper, so be careful. I'm just saying.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Well, it's nice that Nintendo offers such bargains on that stuff.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Right.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Virtual Console. Mario Golf on October 11th, Castlevania The Adventure on October 25th, Ninja Gaiden on November 8th, Zelda 2 The Adventure of Link on November 22nd, Wario Land 2 on December 20th, and Mario Bros. The Lost Levels on December 27th.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Also in Nintendo news, Animal Crossing 3DS updates.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Cool.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Some characters might set up a tent and camp outside.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
You can help your in-game friends with purchasing decisions.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Use your office as the mayor to make decisions on putting things in town.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000
You pick a location for construction to begin on the items you plan on adding.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
A megaphone lets you gather people.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I've got something to say.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:23.000
There's now a shoe store, a museum store.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Dr. Shrunk will be back at the club.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:29.000
There are now many more emotions.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:35.000
You can view the homes of people you street pass and trade items with people you street pass.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.000
You can take a picture with a photo booth.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:44.000
There's now a massage parlor that will relax you and put you into a dream stage.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Maybe this is leading into Animal Crossing Happy Endings.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
It'll be the next game. Who knows?

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
You can explore the town of someone else.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I thought you could do that in the last one on the Wii.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Maybe you can do that with a Haddon invitation or something?

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Maybe.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:04.000
KK Slider will also be the DJ at the club as well as playing the guitar.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
More KK songs.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
You can explore a town with other people.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
You can take the boat to the island.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Grab items from the bottom of the sea.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.000
There's mini games in various stores when you visit the island by boat.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Tortimer is the host of mini games and wears a tropical shirt so it sounds like the former mayor has retired to the island.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And not dead.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
And not dead.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And one mini game has you navigating a maze to collect a certain item.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
What a profound new concept.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Maze navigation. I've never heard of that in a video game.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Frisbee in chat asks, can you still hit animals over the head with the bug catching net?

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I hope so or this whole fucking game is invalidated, isn't it?

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Can you drag animals into an abandoned house and set up a Saw-style trap system for them?

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
No, I'm sorry. I'm not buying this game.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I really wish the developers would just go balls to the wall and put out Animal Crossing after dark.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
We need Volition to come out with Animal Crossing.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Let's see some crazy dildo shit.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000
We need a good old up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A start that unlocks a brothel in your village.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
So wrong.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
So right.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
So right.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I think that's worthy enough of being a dream game to be honest, Animal Crossing after dark.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000
But I'm pretty sure we've talked about something like that before.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Ask Animal Crossing the line.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
All right. Loki, what do you got next?

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
All right. So next thing I've got, this is pretty cool.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000
So what would you say?

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
And I completely forgot about this until I saw the article.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:49.000
You remember No Doubt and Activision?

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
There was a little lawsuit there.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Oh yeah, I remember this.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
They were suing because, you know, people were singing other songs that they shouldn't have been singing.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
You know, didn't like it.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Of course.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Shock.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Settled out of court.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Settled out of court.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Oh my god, you don't say.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Another lawsuit in the gaming industry settled out of court.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Get out now.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I know.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
They've settled.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:12.000
That's it.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:14.000
No word on the settlement.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
As usual, no word on who got what.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Yeah.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
We dive into the mailbag and pick out a few emails that we think we should read on air.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
So let's open up the mailbag.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Hello?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
Hello?

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Mailbag?

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Where's the emails?

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I don't think she's here.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Hello?

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Oh, there's no emails in the mailbag this week.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
So even if DarkSakura was here, there'd be nothing to read.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Womp womp.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I guess you guys just don't have any questions or things you want to talk about.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
You just don't like us anymore.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Let's see how it is.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
You're too busy playing your games.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
You're all addicted to Pandaria.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Let's see how it goes.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Leave DarkSakura a surprise for when she gets back.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
A mountain of emails. She'll appreciate it.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
She likes mountains of emails.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
That's right. She loves mountains of emails.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:16.000
More than anything.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.000
All right, well, what a good opportunity for us to get into the FUs of the week.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
All this is bad.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Here is justice.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Here is punishment.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Here is...

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
This is fucked up.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Loki, why don't you start?

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I don't really have an FU of the week.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
I guess an FU to not be able to play Borderlands 2.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I want to play that this week.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
My FU of the week goes to the listeners for not sending us any email.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Unless you voted for us in one of the podcast award things.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Then you're forgiven if you did that, I suppose.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
FU to that.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
That's a not-so-serious FU.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Otherwise, I would say an FU to just all the money I've spent on this Rocky project.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
It's pretty disgusting.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But you know what?

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
It's a community I really love and I'm excited to see it back in town.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Just FU to nerves and the realization that, oh my god, this is happening in five days.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I'm just freaking out a little bit.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
But it'll be good.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
It'll be good.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
It'll be good.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Alright, let's get to a couple more news stories.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Then we'll take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Loki.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Alright, so we talked about it last week.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:45.000
How there was the oh-so-wonderful promotion that Microsoft is doing tied with your gamerscore.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Where you got a 1% or 2% kickback.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Woohoo!

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000
1% kickback!

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
That's fantastic.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Well, Sony side-upped the deal a little bit because they think 1% is not necessarily good enough.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
So here's what they're going to do.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
They announced that apparently if you buy $100 or more in October,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
you're going to get a $20 voucher for the PlayStation Network in November.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Not bad.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
That's enough to buy Tokyo Jungle.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
And a lot of games online, actually.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
That's 20%.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:21.000
That's 10 times better than 2%.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Does the money I spend on PlayStation Plus count towards that?

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
No.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Well, they said just on PlayStation Network, so maybe?

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Maybe that would count?

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
But, you know, you can buy...

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I mean, I think it's kind of the push you a little bit to...

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
And this is kind of cool.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:45.000
If you're thinking on the fence about the digital stuff,

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000
remember you can buy those digital games.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.000
If you have PlayStation Plus, you get 10% off of the digital games.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Plus, you get $20 back.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
So that could really cut down the cost of these new release games

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
if you're interested in picking up about $100 with the product.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
So actdeft in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
I got 20 Microsoft points for my birthday from Microsoft.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
A whole 20 points?

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
That is a whole quarter.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000
That's your birthday.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000
There's the quarter.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
That's what the special birthday thing was.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
20 Microsoft points.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.000
20 Microsoft points.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:17.000
You know what that will buy?

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Nothing.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Not a goddamn thing.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:23.000
All that will do is that will bug you.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:27.000
It would be like someone went into your house in the middle of the night

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
and plucked out one of those pixels in your TV.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
And, like, made it not work.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
And it's just going to fucking bother you

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
because you're going to have, like, 20 points left over.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
You're like, fuck, I can't buy anything with these 20 points.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I need to purchase more points to buy stuff.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:43.000
And it's just going to drive you crazy until you buy it.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:47.000
And then still end up with 120 points left over.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Some other freaking multiple of something you'll never be able to spend.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
You could buy, according to Dartetsuya,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:56.000
you could buy one quarter of Bungie Ferret Tossing,

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
which is a one dollar game and a great deal

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000
on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace right now.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Ooh.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Oh, Microsoft, you're so generous.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So 20 bucks does sound a lot better than...

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
You could even give me a buck.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Give me a dollar.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
It's fake money.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Now, 100 bucks on the PlayStation Marketplace.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
That seems like a lot of money to spend, but...

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
If you're buying new release games.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Exactly. All it takes is two new release games, right?

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
Or even one new release game

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
and maybe, like, three PlayStation Network games

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
to get you there.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I wonder if PlayStation Plus dollars count towards that.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Probably not.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000
If you have PlayStation Plus or if you buy PlayStation Plus.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
If you buy PlayStation Plus.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Maybe.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Like, maybe this is my month to renew.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I don't know.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Maybe.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I'd be interested to know that.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
To register participation for this week's episode

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:53.000
of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
use the passphrase, quarter.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
All right, one more story for you guys tonight

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
and then we're going to open up the Skype line

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
for calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
This doesn't have to do with gaming per se,

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000
but I think this is a good story

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
because obviously gaming owes a lot of thanks to this

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
and that is the anniversary that we celebrate this week.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000
The compact disc turns 30

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
or the CD is now 30 years old.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Yes, Loki, you and I are older than the CD.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I'm surprised it's been around that long.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I'm also surprised it's been around that long

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
because it didn't really start to take off

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
until about 90, like, the early 90s,

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
maybe the late 80s.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
It's like when rich people had them.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.000
But, yeah, the early 80s is when the CD actually started.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000
The CD was a joint effort of Philips and Sony.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
They were working independently on different versions

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
of the technology in the 70s

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:50.000
and they started to come out right in June of 1985

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
was when the CD-ROM was really born

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
and that, of course, led to where we're at now.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
And, of course, without the CD,

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.000
we would never have had the PlayStation era

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:04.000
or really arguably DVDs and Blu-ray and all the stuff we have now.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:08.000
I mean, DVDs and Blu-rays still are shaped like a CD.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
There you go.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
And, of course, it was a great sound.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
I remember the whole big thing about it was, like,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
you can skip right to tracks.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Like, no more rewinding and fast-forwarding.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I think you could skip to tracks on eight tracks,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
but you still had to rewind them at some point.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Because I just remember the giant buttons

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
that were one, two, three, and four.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Oh, boy.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Oh, this leads to a great question chat.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I love where Tigerclaw is going for this.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Let's go ahead and open up the Skype line

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
and we'll tackle this question.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
While we wait for some calls,

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Tigerclaw in chat says,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Do you guys remember the first CD you ever bought and still have?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Tigerclaw says,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000
My very first CD was the too unlimited album called No Limit.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:57.000
That was a big DDR band.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.000
I remember that.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Loki, do you remember the first CD you ever owned?

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
God, I don't even know.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I don't know.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
It was probably one of the mystery of sound CDs.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I used to buy a bunch of those things.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I used to go crazy over at Virgin Records

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
and buy all the imports.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Oh, the Virgin Megastore?

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yeah, Virgin Megastore.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
The bomb.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Because I used to buy a bunch of import stuff.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
I used to be really into buying a lot of that stuff.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
I don't remember what my first CD was.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I sort of remember my first CD player.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
I had a tape adapter for my car.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000
But yeah, I don't even remember what my first CD was.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Well, okay, I don't really have a first CD

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
because I bought two CDs when I first went.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:40.000
And one of them was the soundtrack to The Addams Family,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
which came out that year.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
And I love that movie.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000
So I bought that even though it was mostly orchestral.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000
I remember having that.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
But then, here you go.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
You ready for this?

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
It was another soundtrack.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:54.000
And here's one of my big gay moments.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.000
You ready?

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
One of my first CDs was the soundtrack to Sister Act.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:02.000
That's right, the Whoopi Goldberg classic.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Was one of the first CDs I ever owned.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I don't still have them though, which is kind of tragic

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
because I got rid of all my CDs during one of my moves.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
So, kind of sad.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Let's see, I'm going to the chat to check out some of these answers.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
DJ Dark Knight says,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:24.000
My first ever CD was Dr. Dre the Chronic.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
See, there's nothing to be embarrassed about there.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000
That's like a classic album.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Actually, no. I remember what my first CDs were

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
because they weren't actually my CDs.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000
My parents, they bought a new stereo system that had a CD player.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So we had, one of the first CDs we had was

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Michael Jackson, Black and White.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Oh, yeah.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
That was like a landmark song when that came out.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Again, our Skype line is open.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
1-877-GAMO-L-R.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:50.000
That album wasn't Black and White.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
That was, what was it called?

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Dangerous.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Dangerous, yes. Dangerous.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
That was it.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.000
1-877-GAMO-L-R.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Let's get to some embarrassing answers.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Rama in chat says,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
My first CD was the Aqua Barbie Girl single.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Love it.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Let's see.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Ziba says,

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I think mine was either Ace of Base or No Doubt.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Some answers that you can't really be embarrassed about.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Act F says,

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
My first CD was an Aerosmith album.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Orange Wright says,

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Alan Alchemy remembers buying CDs for other people

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
were the first CDs he bought.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
The Wayne's World soundtrack.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Primus was Sailing the Seas of Cheese.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Weezer's Debut and Madonna's Erotica.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Let's see.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Zethur says,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000
My first CD was Weird Al's The Food Album.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Awesome.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Well, let me, I need to load up the Twitter.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
I forgot to get out my iPad,

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
so I guess I'll have to do this the regular way.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.000
See if there's any tweets tonight at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I know Tiger Claw usually sends us a couple.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I'll see if there's anything else in there.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Uh, no, I don't.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Yikes.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
At least nothing I've seen so far.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Alright, well, I got some tweets while you find it.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Let's see.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
From Code Man asks,

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Did you guys find a host?

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Nope.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
We could do the Skype host thing,

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:22.000
but I don't know.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Like, a lot of this show,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.000
you have to remember the history of this show.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
We've always been in one room together.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So, you know, whereas taking calls on Skype is one thing,

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
to have the host on Skype is weird.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
To me, anyway.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I understand TR has filled in when I'm not here,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
and that's different because Jamie MCs those shows,

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
so that works out a lot better.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.000
But, yeah, I don't know.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Not being able to see the co-host thing is weird for me.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
But then again, Hoard House works okay.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I can't explain it.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.000
I can't.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
It's just O-L-R's got a formula.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
You gotta stick to it.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Moving on to some tweets from Tiger Claw.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Tiger Claw, ooh, reminds me of something that happened

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
in World of Warcraft today.

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I did not experience this, but I heard about it.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Apparently, and they're blaming this on a hacker.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Yeah, I just was reading that.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Yeah, apparently, a bunch of people were insta-killed

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
in the big city of Stormwind,

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
which is like the Alliance capital.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
This is happening in Orgrimmar as well, the Hoard capital.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000
These were mostly happening on the European servers.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
They started spreading to other zones as well,

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
and I guess US servers were starting to get hit as well.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Level one characters were somehow insta-killing

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:30.000
everybody in the area and the subsequent graveyards.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
So, yeah, crazy stuff.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.000
No official comment from Blizzard,

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
but I will say the servers were down,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
and then the authentication servers were down as well

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
for quite a bit this morning.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
I tried to play around 11 a.m., and I couldn't.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:45.000
So I think they were trying to fix this as it was happening.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
I'm sure Blizzard's seen this.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
They certainly follow the fan sites,

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
and I can't believe everybody and their mother

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
wasn't filing a complaint about the characters.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
So they will find the IPs, and they will obliterate them.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Wow, that's a pretty interesting picture

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000
that they've got for that.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I guess it's just this massive pile of skeletons.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Yeah, yeah, because once you res,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
your little skeleton stays there.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
So it's really funny to see raid rooms

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
when you're working on a boss or something.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
There'll just be piles of skeletons everywhere

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:18.000
so you got shy listeners tonight.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Or does the number not work?

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I don't know what's happening there.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
1877 game olr again.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Let me make sure the number's working tonight

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
because you know that was the problem last week.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
What is wrong with this thing, man?

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Angry Birds Star Wars Jenga?

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
So that's like a three-way crossover there.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Yeah, Angry Birds Star Wars.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Let's just throw everything and see if one of them sticks.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000
This is ridiculous.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Because Star Wars needed more Angry Birds.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I don't know if we mentioned this.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Atlas is publishing all the Calypso stuff now.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Really?

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Yeah.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I didn't know that.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Yeah, that's kind of weird.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Or distributing, maybe.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
This other link here from Tigerclaw is kind of sad.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Oh, we got a call coming in.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Oh, this should be interesting.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Let's go to the phones.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Who's this?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Does your Skype work yet?

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Yes, it works.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.000
I called it from my phone and just verified the 800 number was working.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Yeah, it's working.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
This is Bobby.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
This is your opening act.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Of course, our co-headliner.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
How are you, Bobby Blackwolf?

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
I'm doing good.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.000
I've been in your position where I'm sitting there asking for calls,

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
so I figured I'd help you guys out.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
I appreciate it.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000
You've always been very good.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
You've literally had us on every episode of your show,

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
save one or two when we're not here,

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.000
for the past several years going back to the old network.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.000
So it's really only fair that you get to come on this show,

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
and we try to plug you every week.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000
That's right.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
We've got to hear from you as well.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
So you've had a series of pretty good episodes lately,

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
and you were at a convention this weekend to get even more interviews, right?

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
That's right.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
I was at Siege this weekend,

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:09.000
which is the Southern Interactive Entertainment and Game Expo.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000
I think of it more like GDC rather than E3,

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:16.000
but basically a lot of students were there about getting into the industry

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
and things like that, and it was really interesting.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I got to meet a lot of great indie developers,

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
primarily here in the Southeast,

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:29.000
and hopefully lined up some stuff for us to cover in the future here at VoG.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
So I'm really excited about that,

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
and a lot of people are really excited about VoG.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Sometimes I've really pushed VoG as a network really hard on people.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
And one of our first times in print.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I saw the tweet with the little logo in the program.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000
That's actually in the program that everybody got and probably didn't read.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
That happens. That's all right.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
No, actually they all did read it because that had the schedule of all the panels.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And I heard the VoG logo was above the Microsoft logo.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
It is.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Amazing.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Yes.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000
We're coming for you, Gates.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:03.000
That's right.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
You had a pretty neat interview tonight on your show.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Tonight I was talking to Dustin Clingman.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.000
He is the chairman of the International Game Developers Association.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000
And you were talking about that I've done some interesting episodes.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
I've started trying to theme what I'm doing instead of just talking about the news.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:26.000
If there's a theme I can do, and if it's more like a discussion topic,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
I'll talk about it.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.000
A couple of weeks ago, I did a whole theme on people getting laid off.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
I'm tired of talking about people getting laid off.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000
He did his keynote speech at Siege about a time for optimism.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:46.000
And it was talking about how you should be optimistic about the game industry in spite of...

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.000
And he actually put out 120 studios have closed in the last five or six years.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Oh, my God.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
That's the official number.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
120 have closed in the last five or six years.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
And all this stuff, people are leaving.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Zinga's stock price dropped to this.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000
And he did this entire keynote about why you should still be optimistic.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000
And so I interviewed him and basically tried to distill his one-hour keynote

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
and do a little 25-minute interview.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000
But I basically asked him, why should we be optimistic?

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
And just let him talk.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.000
And one of the questions you asked him was about the video game crash as well.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And you kind of asked, do you think we'll see something like we saw in the early 80s happen again?

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
And he said no. And he had his reasons.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:33.000
As a consumer, I'm not sure I necessarily agreed with everything he said.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:40.000
But I get the optimism and the fact that for every door that closes, another opens.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.000
And that there's this whole mobile thing is now the fad, I guess.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:48.000
And maybe we're seeing less AAA things and more mobile things.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
But I don't know. I kind of wonder.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Part of the reason the Atari 2600 and all that collapsed

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000
was that you had this oversaturation of these little games.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Although, granted, they were charging full price for them at the time.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000
And mobile games are more in the 99-cent, $2 size.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000
And his thing was that the reason that also the crash happened

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:12.000
is because stores just stopped wanting to carry him because they couldn't return him.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
And that's the crux of his argument.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
He talks about it a little bit more.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Because he talks about returns.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
And then I do ask him, so used games?

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
And that's a different thing.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:31.000
But nowadays, for retail products, if the Evil-G doesn't sell through Naughty Bear 2 or whatever,

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
they can actually send it back and get a little bit of their money back.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.000
So it's not a complete loss on their inventory.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Whereas back in the days of the Atari 2600 and the other 12 consoles that were out in 1982,

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
that wasn't the case.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And with Apple, there is no upfront cost.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Let me jump in with Loki.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Loki, the man who works for the distribution company, you say that's not totally true.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000
That's not true. It's all one-way sale.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
They do not allow returns.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Well then why would...

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Is that maybe just your arrangement?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
No, I think it's mass retailers.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000
And the reason why they do that, that's why they do a pre-order program.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Because otherwise they can buy a bunch of stuff and then return it all.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
But it's all one way.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I think what it is now is they get a lot more perks.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
They get a lot more back-end rebates and a lot of price protections and all that fun stuff.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:20.000
But no, it's definitely there are no returns on that stuff.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Because the publishers do not want to be sitting on that stuff.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Interesting.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
And is that why Amazon...

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Isn't that part of the rumors why Amazon stopped carrying a lot of the Nintendo hardware?

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Well, the Effectives are a little different.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
But yeah, once again you have to...

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Usually what they'll do with Effectives is they'll want the consumer to go through the proper routes through the publishers.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Or the hardware manufacturers.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000
They want a person that buys an Xbox 360 to go to Microsoft and have that repaired.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
But a consumer doesn't care.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:53.000
They're like, well, why did GameStop sell me an Effectives system?

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I'm going to go back to GameStop and return it instead of actually...

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Even if there's instructions in the box, do not return this back to the retailer.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:03.000
So of course all that stuff has to be approved.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000
And obviously they're going to approve GameStop over some mom and pop shop.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:11.000
I wish I knew that when I was doing the interview yesterday so I could have called him out on it.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Oh, well, now we'll just have to have another interview at some point.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
That's right.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Or we'll invite him on OLR, let Loki grill him.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:22.000
No, but it was a good interview and the fact that he was pretty open.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:29.000
You did have some tough questions and that's always great when an interviewee can handle those questions.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Alright, so I have to ask you about something you didn't talk about.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Okay.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
But you did talk about it on Twitter, so that's why I know it's fair game.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Because you did post about it on Twitter.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
You got to tell me about what's happening with a certain voice actor.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Oh, God.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
What's up with this?

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Well, actually I phrased it on my private Facebook profile a little bit better.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Because my friends on Facebook know why this is amazing.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
A little bit more than what people on Twitter would do.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:04.000
But I will tell you this, I am not the type of person to go near a dance floor.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:12.000
But I like going to concerts and stuff because I'm a musician, so I'm actually watching the musician.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:17.000
And so I've actually never been really on a dance floor.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Usually I can get out of being pulled onto a dance floor.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
And Professor Shy Guy was playing.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
All those years of DDR did nothing?

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
No.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
You got to realize, I did an arrow stomp.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Alright, alright.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
My bimani was fingers.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
You were a bimani guy. Okay, fair enough.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:40.000
So, he's playing and stuff.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
And he's big on wanting people right in front of the stage dancing.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:52.000
And apparently him and Ellen McClain, who's the voice of GLaDOS, actually have done different cons together.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
So they know each other.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
And I've gotten to know her too.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:58.000
This is the third con I've seen her at.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:04.000
So she got pulled up to the dance floor by somebody.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000
So I'm kind of sitting there. I actually have some pictures of her dancing up there, which is great.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
And then he's like, okay, everybody here go out and get somebody.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
And Ellen McClain comes right to me.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
And she's like, come on.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
And I do the whole no thing.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
And she gives me this look.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
Like, the motherly, you're going to do this.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I said so.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:34.000
When the voice of GLaDOS comes up to you and just stares at you, saying you're going to do this, and starts pulling, you don't resist.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
You don't say no to GLaDOS. You don't.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.000
You don't.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:47.000
So the way I phrase it is I don't know what's more impressive, the fact that I got on a dance floor and danced for two songs, or that it was by the voice of GLaDOS.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:50.000
That's a great story. Love it.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
And thankfully, there's no video of it.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And there never will.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
I have no clue what I'm doing up there.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:04.000
And she was trying. She was wearing this, I don't even know what the clothing thing is called, but it's something that she wears over her shoulders.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.000
She was actually using that and wrapping it around me and doing something.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Whoa!

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Yeah, I know. John Patrick Lowry, you're on notice.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:18.000
Whoa! This is like getting to be Dancing with the Stars level scandal right here.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:25.000
ActDeaf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Ellen made Black Wolf his slave. For science. I think you meant her slave.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Yeah, her. She's definitely a woman.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Yes. Definitely.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
For science.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:42.000
And then he said, okay, everybody go out and get more, so she took me by the hand and we found two other people, and then she handed me off to the other woman, and she took the...yeah.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000
There you go. Who knew that you and GLaDOS would become besties?

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000
I know. We're buds now.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:25:06.000
And somewhere, somewhere, distantly, I can hear the people who used to fear you as the sheriff with the ban hammer at certain other communities we've been in in the past, finding you and GLaDOS having a friendship most appropriate.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Yes.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:15.000
And it's all because her husband wasn't there. He didn't make it, so, you know, she just let loose.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:23.000
That's amazing. That's a great story. And this is a SiegeCon. The GDC. This is fun. It sounds fun.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:30.000
And she was the only kind of voice actor. She was the only voice actor there. This wasn't DragonCon. This is the little GDC-type con.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Right. Well, I hope that she will come to GamerCon in San Francisco, where they've announced the venue is going to be in Japantown at the Kabuki in the Tomo, which is, I believe, August next year.

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:56.000
And she was in one of the commercials, as was her husband. I think some people at PAX got her to do the plugs for GamerCon. And I'm hoping she's there, because you know the GamerCon dance is going to be off the hook.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Oh, yeah.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.000
And I plan to walk up to her and go, and I'll just say, hey, I'm a friend of Bobby Blackwell's.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:11.000
There you go. She does know that name now. She does remember that. We've met three times, so she now knows me.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.000
There you go. Now all the listeners are going to try that at a convention. Don't you dare.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Dude, you could tell her that you heard her on VOG Network.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
There you go.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Because she did, and I know I told you this, and we haven't started putting these on the stream. She did multiple bumpers for VOG on Saturday.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Amazing.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Multiple. She did three of them.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Hopefully one of those is a nomination for, you know, Orange Lounge Radio for the podcast.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Yes, Bobby is going to get her to do it.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Hey, you know what? Whatever.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Don't vote for my show. Vote for Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
No, they can do both.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
I was at the top of Bobby's list, I'm sure, Loki.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
You can do both. Come on.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Yeah, dummy.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:01.000
I didn't ever do a bumper for me. It was a bumper for VOG. Because I plan to promote the whole network.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Yes, exactly. As we've been saying. Even if you're not going to vote for us, vote VOG.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Oh, I like the ring for that. Vote VOG.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
There you go. Well, why didn't we think of that when it started on October 1st?

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Damn it. We still have a few days left. We have until the 15th. Frisbee in chat says, Ellen bumped for VOG.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Yeah.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Amazing.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Alright, well, Bobby, thank you for sharing your stories from SiegeCon.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And, of course, you've got more interviews coming up throughout the week on your own show,

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:37.000
which I can't believe anybody who's listened to OLR at this point hasn't heard your show at one point or another.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:42.000
But if for some crazy-ass reason they have still not heard your show, how can they find you, Bobby?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:48.000
VOGnetwork.com is actually where I point everybody to go to my episodes now.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Yeah, we do that for Hoard House and OLR, too.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Yeah, because there's comment sections and people actually comment.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Last week, I put in the developer's YouTube video that I kept playing over and over again,

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000
and the visual is just as scary as the audio for that.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:11.000
And the upcoming shows next week, I have a live interview with The Game Recruiter.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
He actually is the CEO of GameRecruiter.com, Mark Mencher.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.000
He is going to be taking live chat questions as well about getting into the industry,

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:23.000
but I'm also going to ask him how he can stay at your job and what needs to happen to stop all these layoffs.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000
He doesn't know I'm going to ask him that yet, but I'm going to run it by him.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:33.000
And then I've got a couple pre-recorded interviews I'm going to be playing throughout the next couple weeks.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Tom Buscaglia, who is The Game Attorney.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.000
So we have The Game Recruiter, and then the next week The Game Attorney from GameAttorney.com.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:49.000
He's mostly general counsel to a lot of independent game developers and indie game developers,

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:58.000
and he works with new studios on actually not letting themselves get screwed by legal documents and stuff.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
So we talk about some of the stuff he does.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.000
And then I did actually play test a game while at Siege, and I interviewed their CEO in indie game.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:11.000
First-person magic game using the Crytek 3 engine.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:16.000
We should have got that lawyer guy to represent VOG for certain things I won't talk about.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Well, we talked a little bit.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Oh, okay.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:24.000
It's kind of funny, and also when you listen to that interview, here's a spoiler line from the interview.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
He talks about how he's general counsel to a lot of people, and I actually mentioned to him,

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I'm like, yeah, you're the general counsel for everybody that's here except me.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
And he's like, well, maybe not for long.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Nice, nice. Very cool.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:47.000
So that's all the fun stuff coming up on the Bobby Black Wolf show, and then hopefully I'll be doing more themed stuff as well.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
What big interviews do we have coming up, Loki?

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000
What do we have to compete with Bobby here on Orange Monster Radio?

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
What big interviews have we landed for the rest of the year?

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Let's see, well, next week we've got Cliffy B and Miyamoto's the week after that.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I do want to – can I throw one more thing in? Can I take one more minute?

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
I suppose.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Okay, so when I got there Friday, I saw the Microsoft booth, and it was the Windows 8 developer booth,

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000
and the guy behind it, and I was like, so, what do you do?

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.000
He's like, oh, I'm the developer evangelist for Windows Mobile programming and Windows 8 programming and blah, blah, blah.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.000
I'm like, oh, so can I ask you something about Xbox Live Indie games?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Like, sure.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.000
And I'm like, so, blah, blah, blah, prepaid codes, blah, blah, blah.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000
And I basically go through the whole thing about the prepaid codes that I know you guys covered as well.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:40.000
I hadn't heard of that. Was that like a developer here that's having problems?

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I'm like, no, it's every developer.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
No, it's the entirety of the internet.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Yes. And he's like, I have not heard of that, but if you give me more information about it, I will start an email chain inside Microsoft.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:59.000
And I'm like, okay. And so I found his Twitter, and I tweeted him the link to our article, and I'm like, it's been three weeks and counting.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Because we actually got a comment on our site from one of the other independent developers that actually posted a statement.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:05.000
I saw.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:11.000
About how he's stopping support for all Microsoft platforms until they fix the prepaid codes issue.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Are you saying VOG Network may save Xbox Live Indie games?

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I hope so.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.000
That would be amazing.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Because nobody else writing about this except me.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Weird.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Got Reddit love from it.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Love it.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.000
All right, well, Bobby, we should let you go to see if anybody else is going to take a chance on calling in tonight.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:33.000
But I'm really glad you did have an opportunity, whatever the reason, to come on the show and plug all the good stuff you're doing right now.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
I just wanted to test your Skype, actually.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.000
All right, well, it works.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.000
And I like the pop filters.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Yeah. Oh, do you?

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Yeah.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Some of the new stuff, our new toys, we all have the same mic now, too.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I don't know if that was out there before, but we used to have three different microphones, two different types of connections.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000
It was all different.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
But now everything is the same.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And you guys are growing up.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
And a condenser mic in the studio now.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Ooh.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Ooh.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I did that for the voiceover in the intro.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000
That's why it sounds a little different.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Awesome.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
All right.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Take care, Bobby.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Take care.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000
All right, bye.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Thanks again to Brad from Pod Culture, because I know he's listening.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000
They're fantastic.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.000
What, the mics?

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Yeah.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Oh, yeah, they're great.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:13.000
And plus, I color coded them.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Did you notice?

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:15.000
There's the same colors that they are in the show role.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:18.000
I have a green one, you have a blue one, and she's going to have a pink one.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Nice.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Which she'll hate, but oh well.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Now we need to get the fancy, like, you know how they have the blocks on there that have

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
the network logo and stuff?

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Yes, we could do that.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
That's cheesy and stuff, butcher.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio, if you want to give us

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
a call.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:40.000
The only thing, I've got to find the stand for this condenser mic.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.000
He sent everything.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
I've got to find my old condenser mic.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
I have a condenser mic somewhere.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I don't even know where the hell it is.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
And you know what?

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:50.000
That condenser mic and this condenser mic both have the same problem.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
They have crazy-ass gain on them.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:57.000
They're like, that thing, if I turn that thing on, you'll be able to hear the fan going above

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000
here.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
It's crazy, but I like it.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
It's just, you know, crazy, crazy.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Black Wolf is popping up in chat saying, mic flags.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
That's the official term for them.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
There you go.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Nice.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:13.000
And then the good news is, because he sent us all those mics, we still, I mean, these

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:17.000
mics aren't bad that we have, so it'll be a great mobile kit so we can set up, you know,

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
a better way to do OLR on the go.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:20.000
All right.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.000
We'll give it one more chance for calls, and then I'm going to shut it down and close out

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
the show.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
1877 game OLR.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I did have another tweet topic that Tiger Claw sent.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000
It's not a great story, though.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:36.000
It's kind of one of those.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.000
This is really unfortunate, but I will go ahead and share it with you guys here.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
This is somewhat local, too.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:46.000
This happened in Hercules, California, which is one of those towns you pass going to the

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Bay Area before you hit the Bay Bridge in Oakland and all that.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Well, unfortunately, the mother of Neversoft concept artist Simon Coe was murdered.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
That's really tragic.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:03.000
ABC News 7 was reporting that Susie Coe was found in her home Friday evening while the

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000
family's sky blue 2011 Subaru Outback is also missing.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000
The police have no motive or suspects to the death.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
They are asking anyone in the area with information to call the police.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000
510-724-1111.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
That's very tragic.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
I'm really sorry to hear about that.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000
We have a call coming in, so let's take the call.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Who's this?

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Hey, Akdeft.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Nothing much.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I was also trying to call you earlier to test your Skype, but it seems it works.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Yep, it works.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Hooray.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Well, what have you been playing lately?

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Well, actually, I do have a topic in mind, especially with a game that came today.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Pokémon.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.000
It actually has gotten reviews below 8, but it hasn't been below 7.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.000
It's around the 7 or 8 mark.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:13.000
But it's something that has bugged me since I started reading and probably writing reviews.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:18.000
It's that any game below 8 is automatically bad.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
It's stable like that.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Why do you think that is?

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Yeah.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
And I don't know why.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000
It's something that the whole internet is like, oh my god, it got a 7.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It's bad.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
I don't understand that.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.000
I really don't get it.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Well, that's what leads to this whole artificial inflation of gamer scores, too.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I'm not talking about the Xbox kind.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
I'm talking about review scores.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.000
An average game, an okay game, should be a 5, shouldn't it?

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
But that's really not the way it is.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Average games in this day and age kind of tend to get a 7.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
If you give a game a 5, it's a stinker.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:59.000
That's why at VoG Network, we prefer to use the grading scale that you have from high schools and stuff

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.000
because the A to F scale is a little more realistic.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000
But here's why I think 7s also feel really harsh.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:10.000
How much are they charging for Pokémon Black 2, White 2?

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Aren't these like $40 games?

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
$35, I think.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.000
$35.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Okay, well still, that's a big chunk of change.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
That's the high end on a DS game.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.000
Yeah, that's the high end on a DS game.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.000
And most games that are reviewed for the console systems, you're talking $50, $60 games.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:28.000
When you're going to drop that much money on a game, are you going to drop $60 on something average?

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Well, it depends because if the game is fun, if the game will accomplish what it's set for, to be entertaining,

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.000
it should be worth it.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
At least in my opinion.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Right.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Well, I mean, if you're a fan of a particular genre, you'll forgive a lot of flaws.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:58.000
And obviously, there's Pokémon fans who are going to buy this game no matter what.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:03.000
I did find it interesting though, Shane and I were texting each other a little bit earlier today.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I don't know if he's still listening.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
He said he was listening for a bit.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:15.000
But he was telling me that there's some online title that was released that in some ways, I guess it was only $3 in the 3DS eShop.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.000
And in some ways, it's better than the actual Pokémon game that came out today.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Just with some of the ways it's different and so forth.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Let me see.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Hopefully, he won't mind if I read a little bit of the message here, the relevant parts here.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
What is it?

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Okay, he said it's $2.99 and what's it called?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Pokémon Dream Radar.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:42.000
You can catch Pokémon you can't get in the game.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:45.000
It uses AR like Face Raider so it's not obnoxious.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:49.000
And for the most part, you never know what Pokémon you're capturing until after you catch it.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
It gives it replayability.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Also, it gives me something to spend play coins on again.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
I guess those coins you get when you walk and so forth.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Sounds like in some ways, the $3 title might be providing as much value as the $35 title and that's an issue.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
But of course, that's one person's opinion.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Well, like I said, it can be entertaining.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000
The price in this case is that you're paying for...

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Well, it's supposed to be a full game.

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:27.000
At least you're going to be playing at least for 20 hours.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:34.000
You can probably play a Pokémon game in that time and beat it to an extent.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I do get the value in how much of a replay you're going to get.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:52.000
But like I said, if the game is entertaining, if you can enjoy it, then it shouldn't be labeled as bad.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Especially with a 7, it should be an average.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000
And I do get why the game might get that score.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000
But telling people that it's a bad game?

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.000
It's like if I were saying that a certain game...

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I won't name any game in particular, but it has good graphics, it has good music, and it's fun.

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:23.000
But it has some very bad flaws and it has some bugs.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
But overall, it's good.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:32.000
I'm going to give it a 3, for example, instead of a 7 or a 6, probably, that it should get.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Is it maybe bad in a relative sense, where this game is getting review scores that are lower than the other Pokémon games?

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:50.000
So either A, people are feeling burnout, or B, it's not a bad game per se, but it's a bad Pokémon game because all the other Pokémon games are so good.

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.000
And this one's not really the best in the series.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Probably a former, since most people have been talking about that.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:02.000
The gameplay has gotten pretty repetitive.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000
It hasn't changed, but then again, if it isn't broke, why fix it?

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
I guess that's true.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Alright, Akdeft, anything else you want to say tonight?

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
No, nothing.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Just expect a few... well, a little plug here.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Just expect a few little new articles from I Love That Song.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Especially since Halloween is coming, so it will be fun.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Yep, I'm behind on posting articles, but I know you've got some great stuff in the queue.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.000
And when all this other mess in my life is over, I'll be able to focus on that again, so it'll be great.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Don't worry about that. It will get done eventually.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Yes, it will, it will. I won't let it fall off the radar.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Alright, you take care, buddy. Thanks for calling.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000
You too, thanks.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Alright, bye.

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if anybody else wants to call in.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Are you out of stuff to talk about, Loki? I can't remember if you had anything else left.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I was just looking at some of the stuff. Just going through different websites and stuff.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Apparently, in the manual for Pokemon Black 2 and White 2, they have an advertisement for the Pokedex 3D Pro.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.000
It's coming November 8th, and for $15 on the eShop.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:23.000
That's why the old one's no longer available. It all makes sense now.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.000
I see.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:33.000
See, over 640 Pokemon in full 3D. Yeah, that's worth 15 bucks. Fuck you, Nintendo.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:41.000
So there's that. There was another thing I saw. There was another hack on the Vita, actually.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Because I do follow Dash hacks, and they post that stuff.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.000
It's been not patched, but they removed the game that had the exploit for it.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:54.000
But it allowed people to run a custom firmware for the PSP on their Vita.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:42:00.000
So they can run a custom firmware for 6.6, and it'll actually allow you to run ISOs for the PSP and stuff.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:06.000
But of course, they've removed that game off of the PlayStation Store, so you can't get it.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:20.000
And unfortunately, that was the whole issue where someone leaked part of the guy's hack, and so he left the community.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:28.000
And now, because of that, there's not really going to be a jailbreak on the Vita yet, at least not by that method.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Alright.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Well, it is 9 o'clock, and it looks like no more calls are coming in, so I guess we're going to close up the Skype line.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Thanks to those that did call in tonight, and if you think of something a little later on, you can always email us.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Mailbag at OrangeloungeRadio.com, or of course, there is always Twitter.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, or our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash OrangeloungeRadio.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:54.000
But it is time to wrap up the show tonight.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:59.000
I want to thank all you guys for listening this week, be it live or on our podcast feed.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Remember, if you like the show, all we ask, help spread the word about the show, leave us a nice review.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Wherever you happen to be listening to this show, be it through iTunes or Stitcher or Recommendation or what have you.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000
There's the award stuff I've talked about plenty tonight.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000
And yeah, just please help spread the word about the show.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000
We'll be back to do it again next week with Dark Sakura.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.000
She'll be back from Disney next week, and who knows what will happen in gaming this week.

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:26.000
We're starting to ramp up into that really busy holiday time of year.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:31.000
So out of all those games coming out, it'll be interesting to see which ones we play.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.000
And by this time next week, this play stuff I'm doing will be over with.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.000
So I'll be able to kind of focus on this stuff again, which will be great.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Uh, Loki, what's your final thought tonight?

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:50.000
My final thought is I don't know why I keep getting updates for Stitcher on, um, there, you freaking app.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Bye-bye app.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:52.000
What happened?

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:59.000
I don't know. It's somehow Stitcher added itself to my Facebook, and I keep getting, like, updates for, like, Stitcher stuff.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Oh, maybe because you voted in the award thing or something. Who knows?

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Oh, probably. Thank you!

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:11.000
You can all, if just, you know, although we like Stitcher, you could always unlike it after voting if you need to.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
So, alright.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Alright, uh, my final thought tonight is, um, seeing Loki's McDonald's bag makes me think that I just impromptu had McDonald's for breakfast yesterday and a sausage biscuit.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Good times. Totally not healthy, but good times.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000
I just got a free, was it? Free McFlurry.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Ooh, we playing Monopoly?

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:42.000
God, it's so pathetic. I've gotten McDonald's the last few days because I ran out of stuff to make lunches with, and it's literally almost the same game pieces every time.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:50.000
I'm like, they're not even trying anymore. It's like, there's, like, no, I've gotten Boardwalk, or done Boardwalk Park plays, like, three times already. I'm like, fuck this.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Because they want to get you really excited about maybe having that million.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Oh, yeah, I'm totally gonna win one million dollars. Yeah, it's like...

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Which is payable in twenty yearly installments or something, so it's like...

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Hey, I don't care. That's still a million dollars.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Still a million dollars.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I don't care. That's fine. I'll take that.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Alright, thanks everybody for tuning into another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We will be back next week to do it all over again.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.000
In the meantime, continue to support independent podcasting, and we'll see you next week. Bye, everybody.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or Fogg Network, but you know they were all still true.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
See you next week.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:17.000
Thanks for watching!
